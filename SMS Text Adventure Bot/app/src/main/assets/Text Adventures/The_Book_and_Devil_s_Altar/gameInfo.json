  "A new day. The chance to move on. Weigh the options, then commit. Whether you choose right or wrong, the journey begins by taking a step forward. The Hunter, a man marked by tragedy, plagued by the internal voice. His past appears as phantoms, seeking to claim his soul. The Sorceress, places little value on the lives of men. Humanity is but an obstacle on her rise to power. The Warrior, built by honor. Straightforward in battle, straightforward in thought. The Rogue, unable to leave behind what isn\u0027t his. Some artifacts are best left as they are. The Book, a tome of black magic. Ancient curses rest in its pages, longing to be read. Author\u0027s note: There are six official endings to discover, two of which have characters crossing over from Sheol\u0027s Passage and the Fallen. Entry for EndMaster\u0027s Edgelord Contest 2."
