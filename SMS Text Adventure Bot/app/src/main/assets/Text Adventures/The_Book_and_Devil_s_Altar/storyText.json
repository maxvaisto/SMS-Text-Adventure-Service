{"page 33":"Wake up. The sunlight’s barely risen, but it’s enough to see. Katia is still asleep several feet from where you are, wrapped up tight, only her hair visible at the tip of her bedroll. You sit up, taking note of the extinguished fire. The morning air is brisk. On the plus side, the wind’s died down a bit. You plan to make good use of the break.\n\nThe rest of the journey through the plains is uneventful. You keep an eye on the horizon, scanning for sight of followers. If there is anyone, they’re miles away. Losing a tail will be much easier through the Redwood Forest rather than the open, level ground you’ve been traveling on for days.\n\nThe first signs of snowfall are starting to appear. Light flakes dance in the air, not heavy enough to stick, dying your vision in a white fog. You come across a few pine trees, scattered into the plains, then more and more appear. Finally, reaching the outskirts of the Redwood, you enter, allowing its thick canopy to shield you from the lackluster snowfall.\n\nYour path should only take you a few days through the forest, briefly passing through a section. Luckily, you won’t be heading too deep into the trees. You travel in silence for the first day. The second, you come across voices. Traveling on the main road, just wide enough for a cart, you haven’t come across anyone just yet. Until now. Directing Katia, you sneak into the surrounding trees and listen. A few minutes later a traveling caravan appears.\n\nNot a caravan exactly, but a single cart, a single man at the reigns. Three others, armed, walk next to the cart. One in front, two behind. Instead of a normal cargo bed, the cart boasts a steel cage protecting its contents. A prison. Slavers. The trade is legal in some areas of the world—not here, however. Three bone-thin people sit inside of the cell, dressed in rags, shackled at the wrists. Overkill, if they’re securely locked inside.\n\n“Should we do something?” Katia whispers.\n","page 77":"Upon acceptance, the darkness around you swirls like water rushing down a drain. Twisting, spiraling it goes, although silent and breathless. Such movement should bring a rush of air, but instead, nothingness accompanies. You stand still, at the mercy of this place and the being that resides within.\n\nThen, like a vessel approaching a waterfall, your body starts to be drawn towards the center, losing yourself in the sudden rush. Disoriented, you reach your arms out in protection, while also searching for handholds. Nothing of the sort appears. Your mind begins to spin as if under the influence of too much ale, and a deep anxiousness overtakes your body. Restless, at the mercy of the being, you’re thrust deeper into the flowing darkness.\n\nThen, light appears.\n\nYou’re back in the cavern where you first opened the book. It’s—\n\n—the sudden halt and brightness overtakes your senses. You collapse to the rocky floor, heaving and hacking. Vomit pours from your mouth, leaving a burning acidic taste on your tongue. After a few moments, you regather yourself. Nothing feels different. Whatever deal you made, doesn’t seem to directly affect your senses or well-being. Instead of arriving at a new existence, everything feels the same.\n\nThe long journey you took, the hardships you’ve endured: they mean nothing. Nothing’s changed, despite your strife. You might as well have saved yourself the trouble. Whatever power Lord Tiras, Katia, and others sought after must be the thing of fairy tales. The immortal king. Yes, it must be real. He lives on. The soldier that touched the book. Perhaps, our perception isn’t as great as we thought.\n\nOr perhaps, life-changing moments aren’t grand experiences, simply sudden shifts of direction that will take you where you need to go. A subtle change of trajectory that will take you to your destination, eventually, as long as the path is kept. If this is the correct path, you silently swear to keep on it no matter the consequences. Finding the correct path is difficult—staying on it even more so.\n\nBut how does one recognize the path they tread is the correct one? Make a decision, then commit. Often it feels like nothing but a coin toss. The odds are equal for which direction to take. Crossroads appear with frequency. Navigation is simply a game of chance. No. Make a decision, then commit. That’s all you can do. You’ve made your decision. Time to commit.\n","page 32":"From within your pack, you pull a small pouch of tobacco out. Shielding your body against the wind, you pinch the flakes and pack them into your pipe, testing the density of the bowl with tiny puffs of air. Satisfied, you take a small twig from the fire, still lit with flame, and use it to light the pipe. Soon, steady smoke from your pipe joins the small fire’s, rising in the air, disappearing into nothingness.\n\n“Haven’t seen you use that in a while,” Katia comments, taking a bite from her rations. Tonight’s dinner, dried deer meat.\n\n“If I didn’t feel it drain my endurance, I would partake every night,” you answer. “On the few occasions I’ve indulged with constancy, completing the job felt more laborious. There’ll be time for this stuff later.”\n\nKatia examines you for a moment, peering at you through two curious eyes. “Mm. Perhaps.\n\nMm. Perhaps. Her words. “That’s rather assumptive, wouldn’t you say? If we’re riding to our death, then there won’t be time for it later.”\n\n“If we’re riding to our death, then it doesn’t matter. We’ll be dead.”\n\n“So this could potentially be your last chance to enjoy a good smoke,” Katia says.\n\n“Potentially, yes. I could suffer a leg wound and lose the limb too. But you don’t see me running everywhere.”\n\n“Death, lost limbs, do you really think the outcome will be like that?”\n\nYou take a moment to think. Truthfully, you’re still working it out. Experience says it will. And so do you. “I don’t think the resolution will be clean. Life’s too messy, filled with chaotic elements and random chance. What’s waiting at the end of the road may not be death or lost limbs, but I can assure you it’s not a happy conclusion or celebration.”\n\n“That’s a cheerful thought,” Katia mutters.\n\n“That shouldn’t come as a surprise. At least I hope it doesn’t.”\n\nKatia sighs. “No. I’m well-aware of the journey we’re on. I suppose it would be nice to feel a sense of completion afterward.”\n\n“I never said you wouldn’t get that,” you answer. “But the feeling’s fleeting. Once the dust settles, an empty gap appears where the task once stood, a phantom, living only in memory. The trick is to keep yourself busy, always in motion. If you stay still long enough, the phantoms catch you.”\n\nFor the first time you look at Katia, really look as opposed to your drunken gaze many days before. Her blond hair is tied back, slowly losing grasp of loose strand by loose strand. Some are conveniently tucked behind her ear. Others keep a constant swing in front of her face. The same curiosity still accompanies her hazel eyes, the attribute something you still feel is an accurate description. Although, her eyes are up for debate whether they are more green than brown. Far from innocent, yet unstained by the road. However, that is changing by the day. Her closure comes at a price. But whose doesn’t?\n\nYou finish your smoke, making sure to clean out the pipe before packing it up. Then you place your bedroll by the fire. It only keeps one side of you warm, but that’s more than you had the previous nights. Katia does the same. Two bodies lying near one another, both cold. There are no illusions here, no urge of pleasure. There lies only the task ahead. Meditating on what will greet you at Devil’s Altar, you drift to sleep.\n","page 76":"As you move on from your past, you do the same with Devil’s Altar. You put the twin volcanoes behind you as you travel west. You don’t have a destination in mind. The current plan is to keep moving. Opportunities tend to present themselves with movement. Staying in place, stagnant, is as good as death. You press on as you always have, stepping one foot in front of the other, head down in order not to be waylaid.\n\nThe mountain air chills your bones. Each breath sends a visible cloud in front of your face. Despite the conditions and long journey, you feel somewhat refreshed like waking in the morning with a good night’s sleep. It’s been the first feeling since…since… The recalled memory doesn’t come. You may as well have been on the road your entire lifetime. You certainly have as far back as you can remember.\n\nThis is a strange feeling, not knowing who we are.\n\nYou stop in place. Who was that? A voice cut into your mind, speaking as if it knows you, as if it is you. We? Who else lives inside of your mind? Its tone is friendly enough, although that’s what you’d expect. Odd voices that appear in one’s mind don’t tend to show hostility until it’s too late. Senses on alert, cautiously, you whisper back softly.\n\n“Who speaks?”\n\nIt’s silent for a moment as if thinking of a response. I…I am not sure. I think I am you.\n\nConcerned, but attempting to hide it, no easy task against a voice clearly in your mind, you reply. “Lie. I am me. Whatever deception this is, it will not work.”\n\nThe voice, this time, remains silent. You listen for other signs of it, both internal and external. If there is a spellcaster nearby, you aim to find them and put an end to whatever nefarious motives they have. Nothing. No signs appear again. Keeping a watchful eye out, you continue west.\n\nEventually, after making it out of the mountains, the terrain transitions to rolling hills. Keeping west, you know the coastline will soon appear. The coast feels distinctly familiar, like returning home after a lengthy trip. Without a set destination, you continue west towards the feeling of returning home. Not your actual home—wherever that is—but close as any place will get. Rest, security, contentment: if it can’t be found at home, it doesn’t exist.\n\nAfter many more days, a small village appears on the horizon. Small buildings rise up from the ground, scattered, their roofs of straw and walls of sturdy clay. In need of rest, you head straight for it. As you draw closer, you notice the huts are built overlooking the ocean, not the entire body of water, but a small inlet sits just below the village. A steep cliff lies on the other side from where you approach.\n\nDown the main road of the village, you walk. No signs of life appear, although a few huts display smoke from crude chimneys. Whoever lives here, isn’t much for visitors. Scanning the structures, looking for an inn, you come up empty. Hell, there doesn’t even appear to be a general store.\n\n“You look lost, mister.”\n\nA young girl’s voice rings out behind you. You turn to find just that, a young girl, nearing 10 if you had to guess, standing underneath the shade of a nearby hut. She wears a simple brown dress, tattered and likely handed-down over the years.\n\n“Something like that,” you answer. “What do you call this place? I have not seen it on any map.”\n\nHer face brightens. “Myles. My Da leads the hunting party here.”\n\n“Good for him,” you comment. As you’re about to ask her more about Myles, it appears again. The inner voice. This place isn’t much for outsiders. We best be careful.\n\n“Who are you?” you whisper, asking the same question as before.\n\nI am you. You are me. We are us…I think.\n\n“You speak in nonsense. Quiet yourself.”\n\nAnyone who\u0027s tried to quiet their thoughts knows the futility of the action. This is no different.\n\n“We are not the same.”\n\nAnd if we are?\n\n“Then that is more concerning than a simple caster with knowledge of telepathy.”\n\nWe agree.\n\nThe girl shouts. “That’s him!” You break focus from the internal dialogue, and notice more have joined the girl, one of which likely being her “Da.” Four men stand next to the girl, defensively, eyeing you with obvious distrust. They aren’t armored, barely even armed. Hunters, used to stalking prey, their bows of fine craftsmanship—nearing that of your own.\n\n“You best be off, mister. I don’t know what mental ailment or substance you’re on, but I won’t have you harassing my daughter.” The girl’s Da steps forward aggressively, hand placed on the handle of his hatchet resting at his hip.\n\n“I’m just passing through,” you answer. “Been on the road a while. Was looking for a place to rest for the night.”\n\nThe Da stretches his arms out around him. “Do you see an inn? We don’t have one, nor an alehouse. Only personal homes here, and no one’s likely to offer a bed to a crazy person.”\n\nCrazy person? That’s a little harsh… “Not now, voice.” We need me. “I don’t think so.” Do you remember how we got here? “The past is blank, like I’m on the verge of recalling, but can’t.” I feel the same. “Commonality doesn’t mean I need you.” No, but — duck!\n\nYou slip your head, narrowly avoiding the Da’s attempted punch. Instinctually, without thought—yours or otherwise—you throw a counter hook, landing squarely on the bridge of the Da’s nose. It crunches, like walking on gravel, broken. As he recovers, you catch a glimpse. His nose is twisted to the side like a section of a cliff that’s fallen to the sea below. The girl screams in horror, a shrill cry in response to seeing her father, a man who symbolized strength and protection, broken and bloodied.\n\nBefore the other men can attack, you take off in a full sprint back the way you came. You didn’t mean to attack the man. It just happened. The counter was like the exhale following a deep inhale. It was the natural order of things. Arrows whizz past your head, causing you to zig-zag in order to avoid getting—\n\n—shot. Pain. An arrow lands in the back of your shoulder, the tip barely piercing through the frontside of your torso. Doing your best to ignore, you continue the sprint, the arrow tip flashing in your peripheral, as if the pain isn\u0027t a reminder enough of the wound. Men’s shouts echo behind you. They’re gathering more in an attempt to hunt you down. Eventually a man’s actions catches up with him, and even though you don’t recall the details, you figure you’ve done enough to warrant such a conclusion. Your interaction with the girl’s Da is evidence enough.\n\nEven without memory, your past is catching up with you. You turn back a brief moment to gauge how far away the hunting party is. They’re still a distance back. Hounds bark, joining in with their master’s shouting. They’re coming for you. We won’t surrender so easily. Take the offensive. Outnumbered, outmatched find a weak point to exploit. Your shoulder fires with pain as you pull your bow from your back. Its handle fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. Your mind may be in disarray, but your hands remember well, the arrow nocking to the string, small, but subtle sound of the draw and the strength required.\n\nWounded, hunted, you turn around. Your pursuers are spread out before you like rats scouring towards a scrap of food. Little do they know the predator that awaits them, the true hunter, caged fury needing escape. Wincing, you let loose an arrow. It covers the distance in a blink, piercing the eye of the nearest hound, the first of many dogs to put down.\n\nYou draw another arrow. The hunt continues.\n","page 35":"Making it through the rest of the Redwood Forest was quick. Not three days after spotting the slavers, you emerge into the Sheol Mountain range. The protective canopy that shielded you from snow and rain is now gone. Back in the exposed air, you’re at the mercy of whatever the sky decides to drop on you. Today, it’s light snow.\n\nMountain peaks, as far as the eye can see, greet you with their snow-tipped caps, welcoming you into their embrace, clouds of mist hanging near most. Thankfully, the mountain trails haven’t been covered by the white dust yet. It’s a siren’s temptation, however; conditions are harsh, wildlife sparse. Doom awaits. Still, you trudge on. The trail has turned into a rocky climb, making the horses more a liability than aid. You leave them tied to a fallen tree a small distance into Sheol. Their fate will be the same as yours.\n\nAs you travel into the mountains, the air starts to thin making your journey more physically taxing. Having spent the past several years hunting, your endurance is at a level most never reach. But this is an entirely different element. Periodically, you check the cube, and the map within, to ensure you don’t stray from the path. The last thing you need is to lose a day or two by heading off course. Katia, mostly quiet the entire journey, is even more silent, saving precious breath for the hike. Truthfully, you’re glad as you’d rather save yours as well.\n\nThe journey continues. With each day, your legs feel heavier and heavier, as if the very pack you carry is gaining weight. The incline turns steep, forcing Katia and you to climb on all fours during various sections. Your feet navigate upon loose rock, threatening to slide you down sheer mountainside. More than once, a quick recovery is needed, bits of rock you previously stood on sent tumbling down the mountain.\n\nYour legs feel as if battered by hammers; dull soreness is now their natural state. By the way Katia is trudging on, her body moving in one lethargic state. You can tell she feels the same, likely even worse. Breathing doesn’t come easy. Each inhale brings a satisfying intake of fresh air, but it’s never enough. The air is too thin. It’s as if breathing underwater through a thin reed. You’re using it up at a higher pace than it’s coming in, or at least that’s how it feels. Your pack, digging into your shoulders, have become numb. There’s no longer a sharp pain by carrying the weight. It just is. At night, you have to make a conscious effort to sit up straight, otherwise your back naturally hunches, conditioned by the daily hike.\n\nIt’ll be night soon. The days are shorter than when you first departed from Lord Tiras’ city. The sun itself doesn’t reach as far in the sky, a clear sign the solstice is near, nature itself mirroring your mood. Dark. Gloomy. This shouldn’t be happening. Not now. We’re keeping busy. Apparently not busy enough. Where’s that drink? No, not now. A little distraction would be nice. It sure as hell would be. Katia has some. Not now.\n\nYou pick a spot to rest for the night. You don’t even bother spending the energy to create a fire. After tossing your pack to the ground and removing your weapons, you collapse to the ground, wrapping your cloak tightly around your body. Katia does the same, leaning her back against yours, the weight of each of you holding the other upright, warm. You doze off, still upright, resting your forearms against your knees. Katia doesn’t move, whether due to sleep or not to disturb you is up for debate.\n\n---\n\nA new day. The chance to move on. Sunlight gently nudges you awake. Stiff, back aching, inwardly you groan stretching your arms out. Still propped up by Katia, she sits unmoving, finally exhaustion getting the better of her. The morning air is chilling, although it’s not much different than the afternoon air. Either way, your breath will be visible. As you stand up, you intend to lay Katia down, but she wakes up due to the movement.\n\n“That time again?” she mumbles.\n\n“Isn’t it always,” you reply, slinging your pack over one shoulder, the weight numb, like your body in the cold weather. Katia following suit, you press on.\n\nYour reality becomes the next step, the next breath. Steady pace, steady breathing. The journey blends into a timeless, subconscious one. The world around you simply becomes a backdrop. All that matters is the next step, the next breath. It’s happening again. Focus. Breath. Remember to…\n\nDevil’s Altar.\n\nThe two volcanoes stick out like footprints in fresh snow. Black footprints. The mountains surrounding the Altar are more than snow-capped; their entire mountainsides are covered in white powder, unlike the twin volcanoes, which rise from the earth as dark as a stormy night. Rather than snow-capped peaks, they display a rim of red-orange, lava constantly overflowing and running down the sides. Sure enough, nested at their base, in-between the two black mountains rests a stone structure, a stronghold, ominous and uninviting. Your destination.\n\nIt sits silent. Waiting. Daring. Its stone is dark, no sign of light within. Built from four walls, a guard tower at each corner, the keep itself is fairly traditional. There are no defining features of architecture drawing the eye. It simply is as intended, a fortification meant to withstand siege, only the drawbridge is down. Despite the apparent open front door, it’s not a place the faint of heart enter. You’ve come this far. There’s no turning back now. You willingly approach.\n\nYour footsteps upon the downed drawbridge announce your arrival. They’re a dull echo. Somehow it feels quieter. Birds you noticed earlier aren’t chirping. The occasional whistle from the wind, gone. Nature itself is silently watching your every move, breath held in suspense. The gate, an ocean of black, patiently waits for you. You don’t keep it waiting long.\n\nYou can see. Barely. It’s dark inside. Your vision is as if wearing a piece of thin cloth over your eyes. Objects can technically be seen, although in a formless, undetailed state. Unlit braziers appear to line the welcoming hall. Something flies overhead. A sudden rush of air comes from above, twisting, growing in number. Incoherent whispers fill your ears, starting small and full of breath. Louder and louder the whispers rise, the words themselves still remaining unavailable. It dulls your sense of hearing, matching your inability to see normally.\n\nKatia screams.\n\nIt pierces through your dull ears. Her voice fills the inside of the keep, resonating in its sudden shrillness. Then, just as quickly, Katia’s voice is silenced, a soft echo the only part of her left behind. She’s gone. You’re left alone in darkness, the whispers in the air subsiding as well. Not even they can stand your presence.\n","page 34":"“Follow my lead,” you whisper back. So we’re freedom fighters now? No. White knights? No. What then? Rations are low. Simple as that.\n\nYou wait until the cart is a few feet past your current location, nocking an arrow to prepare. Two can be taken down immediately, provided Katia can aim correctly. You’ve spent a bit of time teaching her on the way. She could hit your makeshift targets from this range fairly consistently. The guards provide a much bigger area to hit. You mentally prepare for the situation, should Katia misfire.\n\nNow’s the time. The guards are close enough for an easy shot, while still far enough away to fire a second shot. You give the signal to Katia. Almost simultaneously, two projectiles fire from your position. Your arrow fires true. Katia’s doesn’t. It flies too far to the right, planting itself in the wooden frame of the cart, beneath where the steel cage is built on top. Taking a deep breath, you nock another arrow. Best to stay calm in a situation like this. Nervousness, frantic movement will only hinder your ability to connect arrow to bowstring. He’s four feet away. Arrow nocked. Two feet. Draw. One. Arrow loose.\n\nThe arrowhead tears through the second guard’s throat in a red geyser, his momentum from the charge continuing far past your current location, like a matador taunting a bull. Two down, three to go. They’re upon you before you can issue any commands to Katia, two on you, one heading straight for Katia.\n\nYou abandon the bow and draw your sword and dagger. There’s no way you can draw arrows quick enough at this distance. Fighting outnumbered, the key is to take the offensive. Take down one instantly, and the others will second-guess themselves. You do just that, sweeping low with your sword, prodding with your dagger. You catch the first man focusing on your dagger. Your sword finds an opening in his guard. His leather armor offers little against your forward thrust. Your blade pierces through his gut and out his back. You pull your sword out just in time to block your other opponent.\n\nKatia’s struggling. You can tell she has no formal training, not that you expected her to. She does more running than actual fighting, taking care to avoid her pursuer’s mace. With a greater sense of urgency, you turn your attention back to the enemy in front of you. His face is unshaven, though there’s not much of a beard, speaking to his age, and his body looks almost as starved as the prisoners he’s transporting. This is not who ends us. Wouldn’t that be something? He doesn’t deserve it. There’ll be another. What’s taking them so long?\n\nYou parry the next strike with your dagger, holding the boy’s weapon in place. Twisting, you throw all of your momentum into the swipe. One second the unshaven face stares back at you, the next, an empty hole of a neck takes its place. Katia! She’s fallen on the ground, her opponent standing over her, mace raised in the air. There’s no time to pick up your bow and fire. They’re too far away to sprint over. Your dagger flies through the air, rotating exactly four times before planting in the man’s spine. He collapses, unmoving, falling on top of Katia’s prone body.\n\nAfter helping her to her feet, Katia apologizes, obviously down on herself. “Sorry, I missed. I don’t know why. It was an easy shot to make.”\n\n“Happens,” you reply, not all too sure how to comfort her.\n\nThree pairs of eyes stare at you from within the slavers’ cage. Three men, ragged and bone-thin.\n","page 78":"Upon acceptance, the darkness around you swirls like water rushing down a drain. Twisting, spiraling it goes, although silent and breathless.

That’s all you can do. You’ve made your decision. Time to commit.\n","page 37":"Who are you? Freedom fighter? No. Each man to his own fate. You’ve managed to navigate yours. They can do the same. If that means they die in a cage, it’s completely up to the way they’ve lived until now. Suppose you are the one to leave them to die in there. Who’s fault is it that they’re locked up? Likely their own.\n\nYou pick through the fallen slavers’ pockets, searching for anything of worth. Right now, rations are just as valuable as gemstones. In fact, since you’re sitting comfortably after the last job, they might be worth more than gemstones. Either way, you don’t need extra trouble or competition for food. The slaves can remain in their cage.\n\n“So are you going to let us out or what?” one of the slaves shouts at you.\n\nYou ignore him, continuing to pick through the fallen bodies. You discover a thin knife, one that looks like it’s been overly-sharpened.\n\n“They caught us illegally, you know. None of us have writs of ownership,” the slave adds on.\n\nYou pause a moment. “Yeah we’re all innocent, aren’t we?” you mutter under your breath. Mmm lie.\n\n“What did you say?” the voice asks from the cage.\n\n“I said ‘we’re all innocent, aren’t we?’” you repeat, raising your voice, gathering the attention of Katia.\n\nThe slave replies, “Some of us, yes.”\n\n“Then I suppose you contributed nothing to the fact that you’re locked up. You were minding your own business, giving coins to an orphan when these men here decided to take you.” Why are you engaging? I don’t know. They know they deserve it. Don’t we all? The truth won’t set them free. So they result to lies. In hopes that will bring freedom. It won’t.\n\n“Our past hardly matters now,” the slave answers. “We’re in here now. If you leave us here, you might as well be swinging the axe.”\n\nYou return back to your quiet nature after the outburst, focusing on recovering items of use from the fallen slavers. They aren’t traveling with much of worth. In fact, their most valuable objects are the three men locked in the cage.\n\nWithout writs of ownership, they’ll likely turn on you. Claiming possession, in exchange for their freedom, might have been a compromising solution for both parties. Without writs, they might as well be unleashed animals, animals you are safer being locked up. Satisfied you’ve scavenged everything worth taking, you turn to leave.\n\n“So that’s it then?” the slave shouts at your back. You stop, thinking of a response, but don’t share it. You continue on. After shouting a few more incoherent words, most of which are curses strung together, the slave slumps down in the cage, resting his back against the cell wall.\n\nKatia, next to you says, “For a man condemning three to die of starvation, you take it with an elegant casualty.”\n\n“Do you really think if the roles were reversed they’d let us out?” you ask.\n\n“Probably not. But that means our morality is on par with three, supposedly dangerous, slaves.”\n\n“Only if you committed whatever act got them locked up in the first place.”\n\n“They could be unlawfully taken, like the man said.”\n\n“And the mark on his inner forearm he was poorly hiding?”\n\nKatia’s brow curls. “I didn’t see any mark…”\n\n“Death mark. Given only to the most heinous criminals. Once upon a time, he was to be executed. Murder? Rape? Could be either. Or both. I assure you, the man’s past is far from innocent. By the way the others acted around him, they’re likely the same.”\n\n“They deserve it then,” Katia answers, taking a bolder approach. “Still, it doesn’t feel quite right.”\n\n“That they do. Don’t trouble yourself. Their blood is on my hands. You have no part in it.”\n\n“No part? They’re stained by association. Letting it happen is sealing their fate. Not that it matters now. What’s done is done, and you move on just the same.”\n\nFor the sake of closure… “If you have that ability, I envy you,” you comment, taking off ahead before Katia can respond.\n\nDeath mark? It served its purpose. There’s no such thing. To her, there is. And when she finds out it’s made up? If she does, it’ll be long after we’re gone. You better be right for our sake. Please. She bears no threat. We saw her crossbow shot. No, but we don’t need the drama. That, we can agree on.\n","page 36":"True, your rations are low. You certainly didn’t put your neck out on the line, after all you’ve been through, just to rescue three slaves. Make no mistake, the slavers possess something you want, and you’ll take it. They did choose a dangerous trade. But somehow, not freeing the caged slaves would be…wasteful?\n\nAs you pick through the fallen slavers’ pockets, one of the slaves shouts at you. “So are you gonna let us out or what?”\n\n“I’m thinking about it,” you absent-mindedly answer, pulling a small ring from one of the bodies, examining it, then tossing it to the ground. Worthless.\n\n“They caught us illegally. None of us have writs of ownership.”\n\n“That’s nice,” you answer, digging through a second body. This one holds a small knife, which you think about taking. It’s deadly sharp, but the steel itself looks frail, likely a result of over sharpening.\n\n“The key’s over there. Next to the driver.”\n\nKatia walks over to the driver’s body, but you wave her off. “Not yet.”\n\n“What the hell are you waiting for?” the slave shouts.\n\nYou eye the cell. “I’m not done scavenging. And I’d rather not have to look over my shoulder while I do. Because the first thing you’re going to do when I unlock the cell is sift through these bodies yourselves. You can take what I leave behind.”\n\nThe slave slinks to a seat within the cell. The others stay quiet for the time being. Katia approaches you, speaking with a low voice. “Do you really think they’d attack us after freeing them?”\n\nYou glance back to the cell. They are bone-thin, yes, but they still outnumber you. Unlike the men you just killed, they’ll be fighting with a suppressed ferocity, the chance to be free. Plus, you don’t hold the ambush position any longer. “They might. I don’t know. Who’s to say they don’t deserve being locked up? For all we know, they’re violent criminals.”\n\n“Then what’s the point of attacking?” Katia asks.\n\nYou pull a key from the driver’s pocket and toss it aside for now. Still digging, you finally discover the item you’re looking for. It’s a small container meant for holding spices inside, and fresh at that. You carefully unscrew the lid, making sure not to spill its contents. “Mmm. This is why,” you say, offering the container for Katia to smell.\n\n“Tea leaves?”\n\n“Not just any tea leaves. Baneweed. Brew a cup from this, and you’ll stay awake for hours. Slavers always carry them. They get paid upon delivery, so the less they rest, the sooner payment arrives.”\n\n“Please tell me we didn’t just murder four men for tea leaves,” Katia says.\n\n“We? No,” you answer. “Besides, we’re saving three, so it’s about even at the end of things.”\n\n“I don’t get you,” Katia comments.\n\nI don’t get myself either. Pack up their rations. Time to move on. You toss a keyring into the prison cell on your way out. There are bigger things to worry about. The mountains are close. And so is the book. What will we do with it? Whatever we want.\n\nAfter fumbling with the lock for a few seconds, the cage door swings open. Three bone-thin slaves exit in a hurry as if waiting too long will forfeit their chance at escape. You make eye contact with the one who you had just spoken to. Suddenly, you’re regretting the decision to free them.\n\n“You almost left us in there,” he states.\n\n“Yeah? But I didn’t, did I?” you retort.\n\n“Probably didn’t for the sake of that lovely thing on your arm.” Directing towards Katia, he adds on. “What are you doing with this bore? Why don’t you join us, sweetheart. We have a camp not too far from here. Plenty of drink. Comfortable beds…”\n\n“Um. I’m good,” Katia manages to answer. The sudden aggressiveness catches her off-guard.\n\n“That’s enough,” you say. “Now are we going to have a problem or will you be on your way?”\n\nThe man doesn’t answer at first. His eyes briefly draw on Katia, then your equipment, noticing the lack of goods left on the slavers’ bodies. “That’s a nice looking bow you got there.”\n\nYou see where this is going. For the second time, you wish you had just left them to die in the cage. Before the man can react, you pull an arrow from your quiver and nock it to your bowstring, drawing to full-length. “And my arrow? Do you admire that as well?”\n\nThe former slave holds both hands up in defense, more of a surrender, really. “Ok, ok we’ll be off then.”\n\nYou keep the arrow nocked until the three finish scavenging what they can from the slavers’ bodies. There’s not much, but they take their crude weapons and armor. All the rations, however, have been taken by you. As they disappear down the road, likely heading toward their camp, you voice your thought underneath your breath.\n\n“I should have left them to fucking rot.”\n\nKatia overhears. “I’m starting to think the same. Despicable men, threatening the ones who saved them.”\n\n“We’ve tarried enough. Onward?”\n\n“Onward,” Katia replies.\n\n---\n\nThe little sunlight that manages to sneak through the canopy causes night to fall much earlier in the Redwood Forest. You’re only able to travel a few more hours before darkness starts to settle in. Directing Katia, you find a small clearing far off the road. Any visitors that wander into your campsite will be hostile, much as it’s been for the entire journey. Bandits, former slaves, the cloaks: it seems as if just about everyone is after you.\n\nTonight you don’t light a fire. The forest is much warmer than the Harken Plains. The wind chill is minimal at best as there is more than enough cover to hide behind. The clearing is only large enough for two bedrolls side-by-side, framed by trunks on either side. You do your best to clear out dried leaves and branches for comfort, placing them around the clearing a small distance away. It’s an old trick you picked up. If an animal or person wanders close, they’ll have to avoid snapping the branches and crunching the leaves. Not foolproof, but better than nothing.\n\nYou briefly think about lighting up your pipe. The calming tobacco would feel nice after the skirmish earlier, but you decide against it. The smoke might attract unwanted attention. There will be plenty of opportunity once you hit the mountain range. Katia cozies underneath her bedroll. You do the same. There is much distance to travel tomorrow. As you drift off to sleep, your mind also drifts towards thoughts of the book. What it looks like, the power contained, the ancient—\n\n—a twig snaps. Dagger already in hand, you sit up, placing your other hand across Katia’s mouth. It’s dark, but your eyes have adjusted well enough to see her eyes widen. You motion her to stay quiet as you slowly rise from the bedroll. Unable to see clearly, you focus on your hearing. The trees remain quiet. Forest creatures chirp, scamper, and rustle their normal routine.\n\nSilence, silence, silence…a rush of footsteps.\n\nA blade whirls in the air. You don’t see it, but you step back in instinct, tripping over Katia in the process. Thwunk! A man screams. This time, Katia’s hand crossbow fires true. Unable to see details, you stab forward in the direction of the scream, quieting the man’s voice forever. Afterward, you crouch low, ready to strike at other attackers. The forest resumes its normal chirping, scampering, and rustling. No other footsteps ring into the night.\n\nYou whisper to Katia. “There could be others. Pack your things. There’ll be no sleep this night.”\n\nShe whispers her agreement, and the two of you gather your equipment, preparing for a night of walking. Tea leaves. Rather than brewing a pot, you munch on the baneweed, offering some to Katia. It does the trick rather well, although you would much prefer to spend the time sleeping. One foot in front of the other. You press on, trying to ignore how you will feel in the morning. Losing a night of sleep is much worse after coming down from a baneweed high. However, that’s a problem for another time. A problem for about four hours from now, to be exact.\n","page 39":"Making it through the rest of the Redwood Forest was quick. Not three days after spotting the slavers, you emerge into the Sheol Mountain range. The protective canopy that shielded you from snow and rain is now gone. Back in the exposed air, you’re at the mercy of whatever the sky decides to drop on you. Today, it’s light snow.\n\nMountain peaks, as far as the eye can see, greet you with their snow-tipped caps, welcoming you into their embrace, clouds of mist hanging near most. Thankfully, the mountain trails haven’t been covered by the white dust yet. It’s a siren’s temptation, however; conditions are harsh, wildlife sparse. Doom awaits. Still, you trudge on. The trail has turned into a rocky climb, making the horses more a liability than aid. You leave them tied to a fallen tree a small distance into Sheol. Their fate will be the same as yours.\n\nAs you travel into the mountains, the air starts to thin making your journey more physically taxing. Having spent the past several years hunting, your endurance is at a level most never reach. But this is an entirely different element. Periodically, you check the cube, and the map within, to ensure you don’t stray from the path. The last thing you need is to lose a day or two by heading off course. Katia, mostly quiet the entire journey, is even more silent, saving precious breath for the hike. Truthfully, you’re glad as you’d rather save yours as well.\n\nThe journey continues. With each day, your legs feel heavier and heavier, as if the very pack you carry is gaining weight. The incline turns steep, forcing Katia and you to climb on all fours during various sections. Your feet navigate upon loose rock, threatening to slide you down sheer mountainside. More than once, a quick recovery is needed, bits of rock you previously stood on sent tumbling down the mountain.\n\nYour legs feel as if battered by hammers; dull soreness is now their natural state. By the way Katia is trudging on, her body moving in one lethargic state. You can tell she feels the same, likely even worse. Breathing doesn’t come easy. Each inhale brings a satisfying intake of fresh air, but it’s never enough. The air is too thin. It’s as if breathing underwater through a thin reed. You’re using it up at a higher pace than it’s coming in, or at least that’s how it feels. Your pack, digging into your shoulders, have become numb. There’s no longer a sharp pain by carrying the weight. It just is. At night, you have to make a conscious effort to sit up straight, otherwise your back naturally hunches, conditioned by the daily hike.\n\nIt’ll be night soon. The days are shorter than when you first departed from Lord Tiras’ city. The sun itself doesn’t reach as far in the sky, a clear sign the solstice is near, nature itself mirroring your mood. Dark. Gloomy. This shouldn’t be happening. Not now. We’re keeping busy. Apparently not busy enough. Where’s that drink? No, not now. A little distraction would be nice. It sure as hell would be. Katia has some. Not now.\n\nYou pick a spot to rest for the night. You don’t even bother spending the energy to create a fire. After tossing your pack to the ground and removing your weapons, you collapse to the ground, wrapping your cloak tightly around your body. Katia does the same, leaning her back against yours, the weight of each of you holding the other upright, warm. You doze off, still upright, resting your forearms against your knees. Katia doesn’t move, whether due to sleep or not to disturb you is up for debate.\n\n---\n\nA new day. The chance to move on. Sunlight gently nudges you awake. Stiff, back aching, inwardly you groan stretching your arms out. Still propped up by Katia, she sits unmoving, finally exhaustion getting the better of her. The morning air is chilling, although it’s not much different than the afternoon air. Either way, your breath will be visible. As you stand up, you intend to lay Katia down, but she wakes up due to the movement.\n\n“That time again?” she mumbles.\n\n“Isn’t it always,” you reply, slinging your pack over one shoulder, the weight numb, like your body in the cold weather. Katia following suit, you press on.\n\nYour reality becomes the next step, the next breath. Steady pace, steady breathing. The journey blends into a timeless, subconscious one. The world around you simply becomes a backdrop. All that matters is the next step, the next breath. It’s happening again. Focus. Breath. Remember to…\n\nDevil’s Altar.\n\nThe two volcanoes stick out like footprints in fresh snow. Black footprints. The mountains surrounding the Altar are more than snow-capped; their entire mountainsides are covered in white powder, unlike the twin volcanoes, which rise from the earth as dark as a stormy night. Rather than snow-capped peaks, they display a rim of red-orange, lava constantly overflowing and running down the sides. Sure enough, nested at their base, in-between the two black mountains rests a stone structure, a stronghold, ominous and uninviting. Your destination.\n\nIt sits silent. Waiting. Daring. Its stone is dark, no sign of light within. Built from four walls, a guard tower at each corner, the keep itself is fairly traditional. There are no defining features of architecture drawing the eye. It simply is as intended, a fortification meant to withstand siege, only the drawbridge is down. Despite the apparent open front door, it’s not a place the faint of heart enter. You’ve come this far. There’s no turning back now. You willingly approach.\n\nYour footsteps upon the downed drawbridge announce your arrival. They’re a dull echo. Somehow it feels quieter. Birds you noticed earlier aren’t chirping. The occasional whistle from the wind, gone. Nature itself is silently watching your every move, breath held in suspense. The gate, an ocean of black, patiently waits for you. You don’t keep it waiting long.\n\nYou can see. Barely. It’s dark inside. Your vision is as if wearing a piece of thin cloth over your eyes. Objects can technically be seen, although in a formless, undetailed state. Unlit braziers appear to line the welcoming hall. Something flies overhead. A sudden rush of air comes from above, twisting, growing in number. Incoherent whispers fill your ears, starting small and full of breath. Louder and louder the whispers rise, the words themselves still remaining unavailable. It dulls your sense of hearing, matching your inability to see normally.\n\nKatia screams.\n\nIt pierces through your dull ears. Her voice fills the inside of the keep, resonating in its sudden shrillness. Then, just as quickly, Katia’s voice is silenced, a soft echo the only part of her left behind. She’s gone. You’re left alone in darkness, the whispers in the air subsiding as well. Not even they can stand your presence.\n","page 38":"Making it through the rest of the Redwood Forest was quick.

Bookshelves line the room. More accurately, the walls are bookshelves. Confident his guards are outside and he’s not to be disturbed, Lord Tiras settles down at the desk, his sight becoming an ever-familiar one of thick mahogany and parchment paper.\n\nJaina is late on her report. Sorceresses. The amount of punctuality they impose on others never extends to themselves. Ungrateful women. They think they’re a higher status than they are, just because a few arcane spells lie within their abilities. Sure, they live a lavish lifestyle, but whose funds allow that? Lord Tiras’. The current sorceress in his employ is dangerously close to having that fact reminded to her.\n\nThe lord sighs. The report in front of him is less than satisfactory. A certain thief has been causing trouble in his city, operating under the guise of charity. Steal from the rich, give to the poor. Lord Tiras has heard it before; it’s simply a way to break the law using virtue as a shield. It’s not the first troublemaker that has directly opposed Lord Tiras, and it won’t be the last. Still, a demonstration is in order for the thief’s eventual capture. Punishment will be imparted publicly.\n\nA dull thud. Something drops to the floor outside of the lord’s study.\n\n“Jensen,” Lord Tiras calls out. “What was that?”\n\nThe study doors open, and the thin aide walks through. Gods, the man is shaking with fear. Lord Tiras hasn’t seen him this nervous since first coming into his service. He must have bumped into one of Lord Tiras’ more valuable artifacts. The Hexdarian vase, perhaps. Considered priceless to most men. Not to Lord Tiras, though.\n\n“Apologies, lord,” Jensen meekly says, his head looking down like a disobedient dog.\n\n“What’s the matter, Jensen? What fell?” Lord Tiras asks, his eyes narrowing.\n\nIn a shower of red, an arrowhead pierces through the front of Jensen’s neck. The man falls to the study floor in a similar thud that Lord Tiras just heard, although not muffled by the door. You stand directly behind where Jensen was, originally hidden by the man. You nock another arrow to your bowstring.\n\n“You!” Lord Tiras spits, recognition on his face.\n\n“Yes, me,” you answer.\n\nThe two of you stare at each other for a moment. Lord Tiras seems to have abandoned the graying goatee and has since allowed a full beard to grow. “Well,” Lord Tiras starts. “What do you want? Money? I have enough to let you live like a king.”\n\nYou reply staring down the sight of your arrow. “No you don’t. Last I checked, you’re Lord Tiras, not King Tiras.”\n\n“So what’s this about then?”\n\n“Closure,” you say. “Weeks ago, you sent men to kill me after I performed the job you hired me for. Why?”\n\n“I know nothing of what you speak,” the lord answers with a blank face. He’s good. Not good enough. Lie to yourself enough, and you’ll understand when the truth is absent. There’s a goddamn gaping hole where it should reside with Tiras’ words.\n\nYou put an arrow through his leg in response. It lands mid-thigh. His reaction is delayed. Almost a full second after impact, Tiras collapses in pain. You’ve got exceptional aim, surely it’s good enough to hit whichever limb you desire at this range. The precision required to hit a vital artery or not is essentially a coin toss. Either way, you don’t really care for the outcome. Either way, Lord Tiras doesn’t survive this night.\n\n“I’ll ask again,” you say, pulling another arrow from your quiver. “Why?”\n\n“Damn you,” Lord Tiras mumbles from the floor, both hands clutching his bleeding leg.\n\n“I’ve repeated myself once. I won’t do so again.”\n\n“Fine,” Lord Tiras answers in defeat. “Then you’ll spare my life?” Receiving only silence, and having nothing to bargain, he divulges everything. “Yes, I employed some men to find the cube. But I didn’t know what they’d do!”\n\n“Bullshit,” you reply.\n\n“Really,” Lord Tiras insists. “I couldn’t send my own men. That’d be too telling. I coerced an underground network in exchange for a pardon. Between you and me, I had no idea the extent that they’d go to…”\n\n“Their actions and the blood on their hands is on yours by association. When a poorly-trained dog misbehaves, you don’t blame the dog. You blame the master that trained him…the one that let it off its leash.”\n\n“Be that as it may, I am truly sorry for their deeds. I’ll have you know, their pardon has been dissolved. Those men, the ones wearing the dark cloaks, are currently rotting in my dungeon. They are to be executed for their crimes.”\n\n“Then I’ll pay them a visit after our current one is over,” you say. “We have unfinished business, them and I.”\n\n“Go to them now!” Lord Tiras answers with much too excitement for the moment. He’s used to operating from a position of power. Collapsed on the floor and bleeding from his leg, the man is out of his element. To be fair, the first time you were in that position, you didn’t know how to react either, although you tried not to draw attention to yourself. A lesson you’ve since learned from. The same won’t be true for your former employer.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to be rude and leave our ongoing discussion.”\n\n“It’s not much of a discussion,” Lord Tiras grimaces, his grip around his leg growing tighter.\n\n“I agree,” you answer, putting an arrow between the man’s eyes. Lord Tiras’ head snaps back. In a split-second, you have a flashback to the way Silvaras’ head snapped with impact, a similar motion occurring here.\n\nThe lord is executed the same way in which he ordered another man’s death. Finally, his deeds have caught up to him. It’s only a matter of time until yours do as well. Until then, you’ll continue on. You’ve chosen a path and will see it through. That’s all a man can do. Inaction has been disregarded. Whether the correct one, whether the moral one, you’ve set the destination. You press on. There’s not enough time to debate the wisdom in your choice. At the very least, you take solace in knowing you’ve committed fully.\n","page 73":"“Freedom,” you say. “I wish to continue untethered by my past.”\n\nMany are chained to previous events, burdened by past sins and grievances. Tell me, what binds you?\n\n“My sins live not only in the past,” you start. “But they are constant, willing to take the reins whenever possible.”\n\nAnd have you sought out priests for help?\n\n“Of course. That was the first thing I did.”\n\nReligion, though limited from the outside, is a way to achieve freedom. The heavy burden of life can be cast on whichever god you choose.\n\n“And that’s just it: How effective can religion be if it’s of my own choosing? It might as well be another hobby or job to take up.”\n\nHa ha ha. But what if it’s your god calling you?\n\n“It’s not.”\n\nHow can you be so sure?\n\n“There are more worthy men to call upon. If a being is calling for my worship, then they aren’t god.”\n\nSuch a simple, if not blasphemous, view of the world. God is real. I’ve seen Him. Not powerful demons or fallen angels who imagine themselves as deity, the very ones men continue to worship. They have many gods. I’m speaking of the divine being Himself. As much as men in service of Him ruin things, He’s certainly real. Being in the presence of someone so powerful—it brings a specific viewpoint only attainable by the act. Life is forever changed after that.\n\n“I didn’t come here for lectures of the divine,” you say.\n\nNo, I suppose you didn’t. You came here because I brought you here. But, you’re right. You seek to untether your past, to live in freedom from past events. They are a heavy burden, are they not? Life, the cruel taskmaster, keeps piling more and more on. Every gift has a cost. This is no different. To be free of your past, you must devote yourself to the divine.\n\n“I’m no monk. And giving myself to the cloth is the same as giving up my freedom. Your gift brings me nowhere.”\n\nI didn’t say join a monastery. Devote yourself to the divine. You say a being who calls for your worship isn’t worthy of it. Seek out the being yourself then…or stay shackled by your past.\n\nThe immortal king, the one destined to rule forever, warned you. Not intentionally, but you saw his story. What should have been a glorious reign is reduced to slavery. The promises of the book are never what they seem. For the thing you seek, something must be given up. Balance. The tome must keep the order of the world. Night and day. Good and evil. Both sides of the coin.\n\nThe cost doesn’t feel like much. But that’s often the case, isn’t it? You’re not to give up a large portion of your life, something you’ve taken years to achieve. Instead, you’re charged with seeking out a deity. Although you’ve never been the religious type, the charge isn’t a punishment in the traditional sense. It’s a job, a new mission to strive towards, not unlike the way you live currently, minus the violence and coin. But then again, you’ve never been one to desire large amounts of wealth.\n\n“I accept,” you speak into the darkness.\n","page 72":"“Closure,” you say. “I wish to end this chapter so I can begin another.”\n\nThat is interesting. What makes you think the next chapter will be more fulfilling than the last?”\n\n“I don’t. But I know it can’t get much worse.”\n\nHa ha ha. I can’t tell if that’s wisdom or cynicism. Perhaps a bit of both.\n\nWith their finals words, the one speaking seems to draw closer, although it could be an effect of the disorienting darkness. As you’re about to respond, a face appears from the shadows. It’s not a human face. It’s something else entirely. Sharp eyes, feral yellow gaze at you. Its teeth are jagged knives wicked in nature, seemingly floating in place—the face itself, though clearly a face, isn’t quite together. Its features hover in place, moving in unison.\n\nIts sudden appearance causes you to stumble over your words. “It’s…well, it’s the truth. Take your pick, wisdom or cynicism. I see it as simple, if not blunt, honesty.”\n\nMmm. I hold the power to grant you with what you seek.\n\n“…And?”\n\nAnd it’s not freely given. The cost must be of equal value. Balance. The world is in a constant battle, opposites fighting against one another. The moon appears after the sun leaves, shining her lunar light until the sunlight takes over once again. Good versus evil—if only one existed, there wouldn’t be much strife. Idealists and religious zealots like to imagine a world free from evil. It cannot be. Paradise is nothing but a myth to drive agendas. Neither can exist on their own. It’s their contrast that reveals their nature. If you rid the world from evil—if that were even possible—man would reinvent it in a small matter of time, from sheer boredom and the need for excitement.\n\n“What is the cost for closure, then?” you ask, knowing it will be great. Your own desire for closure speaks to its weight.\n\nClosure. Balance. The world must maintain order. Closure, the ending of one chapter so another may begin. Closure, the severing of ties. Closure, finality. Birth, the beginning. The cost for what you seek will be your firstborn. The price for your ending is another’s beginning.\n\n“I…” you start, imagining your future. Will you even conceive? You have no wife. No one in waiting either. But if you did, you would be condemning a child, your child, to death. The tome’s gift will grant you the option to move on, but could you really love someone—did you deserve to love someone—if you would make your curse their own?\n\nThere’s always the chance children aren’t in your future. The curse would bear no meaning. Void. However, there does lie a certainty: you would gain the ability to move on. When looking at it from that perspective, the cost doesn’t seem so much. After all, there’s a chance of it not even coming into action. Given a choice to gain what you desperately seek with the opportunity of no backlash, you take it.\n\n“I…accept.”\n\nJust as I foresaw. Balance must be maintained. In order to gain something of value, you must surrender something equal. The joy you’re about to receive will eventually turn to sorrow. Laughter must bring tears. Contentment, anxiety. I bestow upon you my blessing, taking the price which you freely offer. Now go!\n","page 31":"Wake up. The sunlight’s barely risen, but it’s enough to see. Katia is still asleep several feet from where you are, wrapped up tight, only her hair visible at the tip of her bedroll. You sit up, taking note of the extinguished fire. The morning air is brisk. On the plus side, the wind’s died down a bit. You plan to make good use of the break.\n\nThe rest of the journey through the plains is uneventful. You keep an eye on the horizon, scanning for sight of followers. If there is anyone, they’re miles away. Losing a tail will be much easier through the Redwood Forest rather than the open, level ground you’ve been traveling on for days.\n\nThe first signs of snowfall are starting to appear. Light flakes dance in the air, not heavy enough to stick, dying your vision in a white fog. You come across a few pine trees, scattered into the plains, then more and more appear. Finally, reaching the outskirts of the Redwood, you enter, allowing its thick canopy to shield you from the lackluster snowfall.\n\nYour path should only take you a few days through the forest, briefly passing through a section. Luckily, you won’t be heading too deep into the trees. You travel in silence for the first day. The second, you come across voices. Traveling on the main road, just wide enough for a cart, you haven’t come across anyone just yet. Until now. Directing Katia, you sneak into the surrounding trees and listen. A few minutes later a traveling caravan appears.\n\nNot a caravan exactly, but a single cart, a single man at the reigns. Three others, armed, walk next to the cart. One in front, two behind. Instead of a normal cargo bed, the cart boasts a steel cage protecting its contents. A prison. Slavers. The trade is legal in some areas of the world—not here, however. Three bone-thin people sit inside of the cell, dressed in rags, shackled at the wrists. Overkill, if they’re securely locked inside.\n\n“Should we do something?” Katia whispers.\n","page 75":"Upon acceptance, the darkness around you swirls like water rushing down a drain. Twisting, spiraling it goes, although silent and breathless. Such movement should bring a rush of air, but instead, nothingness accompanies. You stand still, at the mercy of this place and the being that resides within.\n\nThen, like a vessel approaching a waterfall, your body starts to be drawn towards the center, losing yourself in the sudden rush. Disoriented, you reach your arms out in protection, while also searching for handholds. Nothing of the sort appears. Your mind begins to spin as if under the influence of too much ale, and a deep anxiousness overtakes your body. Restless, at the mercy of the being, you’re thrust deeper into the flowing darkness.\n\nThen, light appears.\n\nYou’re back in the cavern where you first opened the book. It’s—\n\n—the sudden halt and brightness overtakes your senses. You collapse to the rocky floor, heaving and hacking. Vomit pours from your mouth, leaving a burning acidic taste on your tongue. After a few moments, you regather yourself. Nothing feels different. Whatever deal you made, doesn’t seem to directly affect your senses or well-being. Instead of arriving at a new existence, everything feels the same.\n\nThe long journey you took, the hardships you’ve endured: they mean nothing. Nothing’s changed, despite your strife. You might as well have saved yourself the trouble. Whatever power Lord Tiras, Katia, and others sought after must be the thing of fairy tales. The immortal king. Yes, it must be real. He lives on. The soldier that touched the book. Perhaps, our perception isn’t as great as we thought.\n\nOr perhaps, life-changing moments aren’t grand experiences, simply sudden shifts of direction that will take you where you need to go. A subtle change of trajectory that will take you to your destination, eventually, as long as the path is kept. If this is the correct path, you silently swear to keep on it no matter the consequences. Finding the correct path is difficult—staying on it even more so.\n\nBut how does one recognize the path they tread is the correct one? Make a decision, then commit. Often it feels like nothing but a coin toss. The odds are equal for which direction to take. Crossroads appear with frequency. Navigation is simply a game of chance. No. Make a decision, then commit. That’s all you can do. You’ve made your decision. Time to commit.\n","page 74":"“Redemption,” you say. “I wish for my past not to define me.”\n\nA rewriting of your history. Curious. Only you know the extent to which that entails. Reinvention can occur without my power though. The past is dead. The present is fluid, ever-changing. Many men change along with it. The future is uncertain.\n\n“The past may be dead, but its phantoms haunt my shadows, shifting my action and playing tricks on my mind. I seek to be free from it.”\n\nCurious, indeed. Atonement. Redemption. They go hand in hand. It’s an outcome many seek—and have found themselves. The world of men is a strange place. Each day brings the opportunity for redemption (A new day. The chance to move on.), and yet, you’ve traveled far to ask for something within your grasp. You attribute numbers and names to days, bringing many chances to redefine yourself. Many have traveled less a distance than you have to accomplish such a task. It’s something children do at ease—they have the ability to put themselves in the hero’s shoes in made up games. And yet, you’ve lost that very ability with adulthood. Power, confidence, authority: they’re merely projections. Your past matters little in the moment. What matters is how you choose moment by moment.\n\n“Your logic is not lost on me,” you answer. “It should be as you say. But it’s not. The phantoms I speak of, they hold me back ‘moment by moment.’ I know what I should do—deep down—it speaks as a small whisper, like a voice lost in the wind. It speaks of the truth path, but the body does not respond. The mind does not respond. It’s fixated and lost. It’s as if I know right from wrong, but have the inability to act on such knowledge. Redemption is all that I seek, whether I find it in my home village or far off into the Sheol Mountains.”\n\nThen it shall be as you desire. However, my gift does not come without a price. Balance must be kept. In order to gain what you seek, something of a similar cost must be offered.\n\n“I’ll pay it, no matter the cost.”\n\nHa ha ha. Aren’t you the eager one? We have entered a pact, you and I. Redemption can be given. Your past will not define you…but it will not be a part of you at all. Your memories, and all that has occurred before this day, will be mine. When you try to remember the past, it will be as if recalling a word that is on the tip of your tongue, just out of reach. You will have the feeling if you think just a little bit harder it will appear. But it never will. Your memories, both good and bad, will be mine for whatever I see fit to do with them. A blank slate you will be. The past cannot define you if you have no past.\n\nA high cost. You’ll have no memory of past experiences. Nothing of life’s joy will remain. In contrast, neither will the nightmares. It’s the ultimate numbing, better than any drink or fix. The things you seek to escape won’t just be temporarily silenced; they’ll be silenced forever. A high cost, but any price is worth it.\n\n“I accept.”\n","page 44":"The book must be deep in the stronghold. In your experience, that’s where it’d be. The most secure area lies below ground, guarded and buried. True, the upper levels would have housed the important members along with other artifacts that may catch a thief’s eye, but you’re not here for precious jewels and gems. Wealth isn’t what you’re after. You take the staircase downward.\n\nThe staircase spirals down, twisting around a central column. You creep, bow in hand, ready to fire upon any appearing threats. It takes a matter of minutes to reach the bottom. You’re met with an orange glow peering onto the bottom steps of the staircase, too constant to be traditional firelight. Devil’s Altar, the space between twin volcanoes. Realization hits you.\n\nConfirmation accompanies the thought as you reach the bottom step. The staircase opens into a large cavern. Pools of magma fill the space, lighting the area with its red-orange glow. Instead of man-made stone, the floor is rocky. Pillars, like stony icicles, hang from the ceiling, more than a few creating their inverse from the floor. Besides the magma pools and rock pillars, one other thing sits in the cavern, resting comfortably, quiet: a stone pedestal with a black book sitting on top. The book. You’ve found it.\n\nEven though you’re still quite a distance away, the book itself doesn’t look like the kind men would kill for. If anything, it seems rather plain. Its cover is pure black as expected, but it’s void of markings or inscriptions. You expected something to signify its worth. Also, it doesn’t hold many pages. You’ve seen many religious texts with more content. As long as it contains the power Richter spoke about, it doesn’t matter what it looks like.\n\nYou confidently stride towards it. Everything you’ve struggled for is finally within your reach. The long journey to Devil’s Altar, physically taxing it was, memories of your former past appearing with more frequency—it’ll all be worth it soon. You pass by the rocky pillars, rows of stony pews leading towards the sacred text.\n\nSuddenly, the distinct click of a floor switch rings into the cavern. What did you get us into? Richter was the one who checked for traps. And you didn’t think to check? We didn’t notice it. The ground softly rumbles beneath you. More mechanisms locking into place, shifting gears. Your foot still remains on top of the pressure plate.\n","page 43":"The book was in someone’s possession. They wouldn’t keep it locked away, far from their dwelling quarters. If what Richter said is true, and so far it has been, the book is something to be used, not tucked away. You take the staircase leading up, stepping on each stair as not to tire out your legs. Using the bannister would help, although you’d rather keep an arrow nocked. Up and up it rises, twisting, sending your climb into a slight lean to adjust for the non-linear route.\n\nYou climb to the very top. After reaching it, you stop for a few moments to catch your breath. Your legs, still affected by the journey here, get some well-needed rest. Whatever lies in wait will be best confronted with fresh legs—well, as close to that as possible.\n\nAs you’re about to continue on, something catches your attention. A small scratching noise, perhaps a shuffle of boots, echos softly from a nearby room. From the top of the staircase, a series of rooms line both sides of the walls, their doors wide open, all leading towards a large pair of double doors. Ensuring your arrow is still nocked, you creep forward, ears trained towards the source of the sound.\n\nIt’s coming from the first room on the right. Drawing closer, you can tell the rooms are various studies and libraries, not residential like you first assumed. Heavy layers of dust gather on their desks and bookshelves, cobwebs almost as common as tomes themselves. No ally is to be found here. Only threats.\n\nYou burst into the first room, bowstring drawn. Movement on the floor. Arrow released. The familiar scrape of your bowstring touches your fingers as you release, the arrow’s feather lightly tickling your cheek as it’s sent towards its target. A small rat lies skewered on the floor, your arrow almost traveling completely through the rodent, if not for hitting the stone floor beneath.\n\nA piercing screech fills the room, causing you to drop to a knee, both hands placed against your ears in defense. Papers fly from desks, books fall from shelves. Banshee’s wail. Tormented soul. Pain. The screech tapers off, ending with an agonized whimper, the strength of the outburst turning soft. Wood creaks, hinges in desperate need of oil squeal. The large double doors open of their own accord.\n\nPicking up your bow from the floor next to the dead rat, you nock another arrow and stride towards the open doorway. Your presence is noticed; there’s no point in attempting subterfuge now. Best to appear confident, sure of yourself. However, you still check each room as you pass by. Just because you mean to walk through the double doors doesn’t mean danger isn’t still present. Could be a trap. Could be. You walk through the open doorway.\n\nSmall steps lead to a throne in the center of the room. An intimate setting, rather than a grand throne room. Perhaps meant for judging a small council, your best guess, considering the rooms leading here. A corpse sits on the throne, his body long into decay, the few long strands of hair remaining fall underneath a dust-covered crown, which once shined with splendor. Now, it’s a dull yellow, fitting for the wearer. You take the first step. The corpse moves.\n\nBones cracking, a groan escapes through his mouth where his lips once were; they’ve long since decayed from attachment. You pull back to fire an arrow. Dead eyes meet yours, framed by the remnants of long strands of hair.\n\n“Do it,” the corpse whispers, a voice strained, soft, only loud enough to hear in total silence.\n","page 46":"If the click was the only sound, then maybe you would stay put. What really concerns you is the mechanisms happening underground. Whatever they are connected to likely means bad news for whoever tripped the switch, in this case, you. Not willing to stick around and see what special surprise awaits you, you take off towards the book.\n\nPillars of rock, both from the floor and ceiling, explode in showers of rock, filling the cavern interior with shrapnel. It’s like running through a burning building—dust clouds appear, thickening your vision into a blur of brown-gray. Holding your hands in front of your face, you continue the sprint.\n\nPools of magma start to overflow, blocking a direct route to the book. You keep up the pace, dodging stone and hopping between running magma. Closer and closer you get, your arms starting to wear the damage, although it’s much preferable to taking the wounds in more sensitive areas.\n\nSomehow, you manage to make it to the book, clothes torn, skin bloodied. It sits quietly on the stone pedestal, untouched by the chaos you’ve just run through. After all this way, traveling from across the Harken Plains, through the Redwood Forest, and now into the Sheol Mountains, you’ve made it. The book is yours.\n\nWith both arms you reach out towards the plain black cover. All your struggling has paid off for this moment. Men were sent to kill you for the book. They tried, but didn’t succeed. Weeks have led up until now. Your fingers grasp around the book and—\n\n—paralyze. Your body becomes stiff, unable to control your limbs like being half-asleep during a night terror. Then, movement happens, although not of your own accord. Your arms start to shake uncontrollably as if carrying a great weight. Coldness overtakes your body. The next thing you know, you’re on the floor convulsing, chest heaving up and down, shaking side to side.\n\nThe book itself is trapped, your final thought before dying at the feet of the very thing you’ve traveled many miles in search of. If it’s any consolation, you found it.\n","page 45":"Whatever is happening underground beneath you, one thing’s for certain: taking your foot off the pressure plate is a sure way to die. Foot-spring traps tend to have that effect once pressure is relieved. You remain in place, senses high, scanning for threats.\n\nMovement. The pillars of rock from both the floor and ceiling burst open, sending shards of stone into the air in a small show of fireworks. Still keeping your foot on the plate, you cover your arms in front of your face, dropping your bow in the process. Heavy shrapnel showers on top of you, the sharp sides tearing into your exposed skin.\n\nLooming over you, a dark shadow builds, a large section of stone falls directly where you stand. Given no choice, you dive to your left to avoid being crushed completely. Through the explosion of rock, another distinct click rings.\n\nThe pools of magma that light the cavern start to bubble, growing larger, threatening to overflow. You try your best to dodge the rain, but more stone lands upon your body, deadening your limbs. One large piece lands squarely to your head, dropping you to the floor. Dazed, you look towards the book one final time, a thing of evil, a thing of promises.\n\nThe entire cavern collapsing on itself, magma flowing towards your fallen body, you accept your inevitable death. Finally, peace.\n","page 49":"Nodding, you take a step back. You raise your bow into position, arrow nocked. Dead eyes meet yours. You release. The impact snaps the corpse’s head back with a sickening crack. Your arrow pins his head against the throne behind him.\n\nFrom the lower levels of the keep, deep rumbling echos softly beneath your feet. Wisps of dark magic fly into the above you. Black violet rays, originating from the corpse’s chest, bends his back unnaturally. Like ribbons in the wind, the wisps fly and twist in the air.\n\nRumbling growing louder, the very ground beneath you starts to shake. He was bound to this place. Could the place also be bound to him? Seems that way. Chunks of stone begin to fall from the floor, disappearing into lower levels of the keep, leaving behind empty gaps under your feet.\n\nAnother otherworldly screech fills the air. Instantly, your bow drops from your hands as you motion to cover your ears. Blood starts to pour from your ears as you crouch down as some sort of escape from the piercing sound.\n\nThe ground quakes, knocking you sprawling to the floor. Where you land, the stone has fallen from the floor. Your hands manage to latch onto a piece of rock; your feet dangle in the empty space. Quake. You start to climb up. Quake. The blow slides you down, dangerously close to falling in completely. Quake. Your handhold crumbles under your weight. As you fall into the empty gap, the last thing you see is the corpse’s head pinned to the throne behind him, a dusty crown on his head. A rush of air. Nothingness.\n","page 40":"Being barely able to see, you focus on what does appear to you. Unlit braziers lining the walls, dark, undefined columns supporting the room. No sign of Katia. You kneel to examine the place where she just stood, feeling the stone floor. It’s rough with small rocks, dusty. Perhaps once the floor was smooth when the keep was occupied. However, now, its abandonment is made known. The floor is solid enough, and there aren’t signs of a trap door. It’s as if Katia just…disappeared into thin air.\n\nSpeaking of which, the air is heavy with sulfur. Not a huge surprise since you’re sitting in-between two volcanoes, but its depth is what stands out, like you’re breathing directly into the mountains. There may be a collapsed tunnel underneath the keep allowing the element to stain the air. You never were a scholar, so the thought comes from instinct and what little experience you have. You could be way off base, but one thing’s for sure, the sulfuric smell is much too strong than it should be.\n\nShe’s gone; we need to press on. I will not abandon her. The answer lies with discovering the book. Is that what we came here for? Isn’t it? I’m—we’re—still figuring that out. We’re here. There’s no point in wandering around aimlessly. Find the book. Find the girl.\n\nKatia will understand. She knew the risk in coming here. While on a certain level it feels wrong… You cut the thought short. You’ve never invested in your traveling companions. They’ve been nothing but tools, each with their own use to compliment certain skillsets that you lack. Katia is no different. She can’t be different. If you are to survive, you can’t allow others to dictate your action. No ties, no weakness. You act of your own accord. The book lies within the keep. Men have tried to kill you for it. Your future lies with the book. There’s but one path ahead.\n","page 42":"The only option is to press on. Katia understood the danger. The book is close to being in your possession. Who knows? Finding the book could bring the secret to finding Katia. As far as you know, she’s not dead. No, you came to the Altar to find the book and discover the mystery within. Her closure will be found along with the book.\n\nYou can just make out an entryway at the end of the hall. A black hole, rising to the height of the ceiling. No door attached, simply an empty space. Walking more carefully now, bow drawn and arrow nocked, you make your way across the room, a lone man in the center of the room, crossing past circular columns several times thicker than an aged oak trunk.\n\nEvil marks this place. So we’ll fit right in. The keep is silent, save for your soft footsteps on the stone floor. Your steps are muffled, intentionally quiet, but each small sound carries throughout the chamber. Something lurks in the shadows. Objects of worth aren’t usually kept in the open. Or unprotected. Or unprotected.\n\nWhat are we going to do with the book? Haven’t decided yet. Better decide soon. One step at a time. First, find the book. Our decision only matters after it’s found. Best to focus on the present. The future is uncertain. One thing is certain. What’s that? Life is fleeting. You pause, the latest thought unlike the others. Since when have you become sentimental? It’s not an untrue statement, but it’s not without implication. Life is fleeting. What are you going to do about that? What can anyone do about that? First, find the book. Existential thinking can be saved for later.\n\nThe entryway takes you into a long and narrow hallway. By now, your eyes have adjusted fairly well to the dark. Small details fade into a formless mist, but other than that, you can make out your surroundings. Torches line the hallway, unlit of course, matching the braziers in the welcoming hall. Once, the keep displayed signs of life. Now it lies cold, dead. Tomblike.\n\nA spiraling staircase greets you at the end of the hallway, winding both up and down, its banister smooth stone carved into the keep. The staircase is wide.

Its purpose was to lead you here, and that’s just what it did.\n\nThere could be a vault below, holding the keep’s most precious artifact safely guarded away. Then again, whoever ruled here in the past would reside on the higher levels. As the book was likely in their possession, it makes sense to keep it close to them. Your guess is as good as any. Sometimes you find yourself in a seemingly random situation, uninformed on the outcome. It may appear to be a coin toss, but you have past experience to rely on, to guide your action.

The west side, more specifically, the Sevenfold District, is where the city’s wealthiest members reside, not far from Lord Tiras’ keep. Jaina, although able to travel and live in the wilderness for weeks, preferred comfort, and the bounty from Silvaras allowed her that lifestyle, the only cost being a few weeks of camping…and a man’s life.\n\nAlthough able to afford a fine coat to blend in, you keep to your normal clothes, a long hooded overcoat, leather armor underneath, and, of course, your weapons. It’s not that you’re opposed to dressing nice,but the alley’s events call for survival over social precedence. You’ll worry about your social standing once convinced the threat is dealt with. After receiving more than a few strange looks, you find yourself standing outside of A Diamond a Dozen, commonly referred to as the Diamond.\n\nWhite paint, bright blue trim, it looks exactly like the place the sorceress would stay in. Ignoring the doorman offering to check your coat, you walk through the front door. Candles greet you upon entry. No, not candles, but rather magelight in lamps. Golden rays glow softly, illuminating the interior in fabricated angelic light.\n\n“Sir, if you’re looking for food, you can find it down the street. The soup kitchen takes care of many people…enduring hardship.”\n\nThe assumption from the greeter catches you a bit off guard, although you should have expected it. “What? No, I’m not looking for food.” As if it heard you, your stomach growls, remembering the stew left behind earlier. “Well now that you mention it, I’ll take a bowl of stew.”\n\n“Stew?” The woman curls her perfectly-manicured brow. “If you’re looking for soup, the kitchen down the road can provide some at a reasonable rate…otherwise today’s special is a shark meat broth, served with scallops and freshly-picked green onion. But company policy is to see the coin up-front…”\n\nSure it is. It’s likely the policy for anyone not wearing this year’s edition of Garth Royale’s coat and boot combination. In response, you pull more than a few gold coins from your pocket, much more than overpriced soup is worth, and toss them to the woman. “That should handle it. Prepare it to go. I’m meeting my companion here, a woman named Jaina. Which room is hers?”\n\n“Oh! you’re with Jaina? Please, sir, the payment is not necessary then. Like your colleagues who arrived before you, you can charge it to the room. 812. While you’re up there, please ask Miss Jaina if she needs more sheets.”\n\nOther colleagues? Shit. You’re too late. You thank the woman, then head to the winding staircase that leads to the rented rooms. Along the way, you take a few pieces of food from various servers working the room, bringing finger food to the guests lounging in the Diamond. Room 812, on the eighth floor, the top level of the inn.\n\nYou find the door to Room 812 slightly cracked.\n\nDrawing your blade slowly so as not to create a sound, you listen for a few seconds before entering. Not hearing anything, you push the door open just enough to slip inside. There, you\u0027re greeted with what can only be described as an arcane mess. Clothes are spread across the floor, dresser drawers all open, their contents rifled through. The room looks as if a hurricane ran through. Pictures once hanging on the wall lie scattered on the ground, the same for Jaina’s personal library. Luckily, she was convinced to leave it behind on your journey. No sign of the woman herself.\n","page 19":"He may possess more information on his body than the words he spoke. Then again, it’s highly unlikely he would kill himself if the knowledge could be found on his physical body. That is, unless he feared his employer would do worse. Either way, you have to search him, just in case.\n\nYour hands slide through his pockets, searching for a note, letter, or any sort of lead. The only thing in his trouser pockets is a piece of paper with “Herald’s Fire” written on it, providing a rough map on the street location. You find less on the inside of the man’s cloak. There aren’t any pockets, so you check for signs of sewn in compartments. Nothing.\n\nYou remove each boot from the man, checking the insides. All you find is a peculiar smell. No leads. He may not be carrying anything on him, but he can’t hide himself. Squatting down to focus your attention on the body, you take in his defining characteristics.\n\nFrayed cloak, like the others. Weapons of good quality. Discovered alone. Two were sent after you. Willing to end his own life, rather than be interrogated, which speaks to his employer’s dangerousness or unquestioned loyalty to the mysterious figure. Perhaps both. His face is unkempt. If he possessed military experience, the discipline of daily grooming didn’t stick. Whatever skills he did possess were enough to catch Richter, no small feat. The rogue made his way through countless traps. However, this time, he got caught in the snare.\n","page 5":"Your heavily-armored companion didn’t rent a room like the others. Rather, he stayed with a family. You remember the conversation vividly as you were on your way back to Lord Tiras.\n\nHeavy snowfall fills your vision as you travel from the Spirit of Truth’s medical camp. Your confrontation still raises questions in your mind, but you’re not in the place to ask them. Your job was to end a man’s life, not to question the morality of it. Can you really apply morality to your deed? I do as I must to survive. Far from danger, the four of you travel with a more relaxed demeanor. After listening to a tale from Richter on his theft of a noblewoman’s precious jewel, Maxx changes the topic.\n\n“None of you have military experience I presume?”\n\nThe three of you glance at each other, seeing if your response is in accordance. It is. You take initiative. “No. Richter’s behavior speaks for himself, but neither Jaina or I have experience.”\n\nRichter, starting to take offense, stops and acknowledges the truth of the statement.\n\n“There is a bond forged through battle, one that is unshaken throughout time.” Maxx pauses for a moment, finding it difficult for words to appear. Like his fighting style, he takes a forward approach. “I feel a similar bond between the four of us. Although our time together is brief, just a matter of weeks, I consider each of you like the men I served with in the auxiliary.”\n\nThe three of you, once again, glance at each other. You know your time is drawing to an end, and it was created around a single task. Once the job is complete, you’ll go your separate ways. Bonds, companionship, even friendship, holds no place here. It’s a job, clean and simple. Specific skillsets were required. That’s the extent of it all. Maxx on the other hand, perhaps due to his military experience, is unable to differentiate the two. He continues.\n\n“There’s someone I’d like you all to meet, a friend from my time spent serving. He lives near Lord Tiras with his family, my former sergeant, a mentor. Settled down after retirement. He always spoke with wisdom.”\n\nYou see where this is going.\n\n“Silvaras wasn’t the man we were led to believe. That much is clear. He was different.”\n\nYou cut his thoughts short. Even now, such talk is dangerous. Lord Tiras would want to hear none of it, and if he’s willing to hire killers to end Silvaras, he’ll do the same for you. “Enough of that. Lord Tiras hired us to end the cultist. We have. That’s it. End of story.” Your harsh words hurt the big man. It’s clearly shown on his face. Better his feelings hurt than risk the safety of the four. As the one who organized it all, you’re willing to pay the cost.\n\nYou find the house deep in the residential district. It’s built to the same structure as those surrounding it, narrow, three stories, four windows, and a small stone staircase to the front door. You take the steps, drawing your dagger, but not wanting to look like you’re planning to enter the house armed, you hide it behind your back. You knock. There’s no answer.\n\nYou place your ear against the front door to listen for movement inside. Nothing. Checking the handle, you find it unlocked, so you slowly turn the knob and slip inside. Calling it a bloodbath would be putting it lightly. The floor, furniture, ceiling, and walls are covered in it, like red paint spilled upon a canvas. Instantly, the smell brings queasiness to your stomach. Bodies, like puppets limply attached to their strings, are spread out before you, limbs in twisted positions.\n\nThere are five in total, three adults and two children. Whoever was sent after you, found Maxx. The large man’s body sits limp, tied to a chair, his shirt stripped, displaying several punctures on his torso. He was interrogated. His mentor’s family used as motivation to talk. Did he know anything? I don’t know. He’s not the type to keep secrets. No, he’s not. This looks bad, you know. I’m well aware. We should get out while we can. After I search the house. A man entering a home, five bodies found. I know. This is hard enough with a mysterious group after us. It will be worse with the law after us too. I know that!\n\nYour search comes up empty. After saying your farewell to the big man, you continue on. It’s too late for Maxx. Hopefully that isn’t the case for…\n","page 18":"Unfortunately, you know exactly where Richter is staying. He’s renting a room at a tavern, a tavern that employs a certain waitress you weren’t planning on seeing any time soon. The present situation, however, overrides uncomfortable social settings, so you make your way to Herald’s Fire.\n\nIt’s still early, and luckily you don’t see Katia as you enter. One of the waitresses gives you a dirty look. Somehow she’s aware of last night’s (and this morning’s) events. Scorn a woman and you might as well be scorning their friends as well. Mindless fools. Learn to think for yourself. A small staircase lies at the end of the room, which leads to a hallway of rented rooms, four in total. It’s a tavern, after all, not an inn. It’s unusual they offer rooms at all, likely they’ve become the workplace for girls looking to fill their pockets with a few coins.\n\nFinding the door to Richter’s room, you knock. Silence. “Richter?” you speak to the closed door. No answer. You could run downstairs and explain the situation to the owner. Given a man’s life is in danger, you’re sure you could procure a key to the room. But that could take too much time. Besides, your reputation is already low thanks to Katia. How much damage would a little vandalizing do?\n\nYou kick open the door to Richter’s room.\n\nThe heel of your boot smashes into the door, sending splinters flying in the air. Lockpicking was Richter’s job. You’re certain Maxx would approve of your current strategy. Jaina would act unimpressed, like the way she acted for most things.\n\nSurprisingly, the room is in fair condition. It’s a simple thing, a small bed in the center and a desk in the corner. A single candlestick sits on the nightstand, unlit for a while by the looks of it. No sign of Richter or any assailants. Strange. Out of your former companions, you assumed Richter was the one most likely for suspicious behavior. Everything in the room feels too…neat.\n\nYou begin to search the room for clues. It hits you that it’s possible Richter hasn’t been visited yet. Whoever is after you might not know the whereabouts of the rogue. Either that or Richter skipped town already. He does have a disposition to avoid dangerous situations. Starting with the bed, you feel for hidden objects underneath the covers and frame. Nothing. Then, you transition to the desk. Nothing. As you turn to leave, a small scratching noise appears behind you.\n\nErrchh!\n\nIt came from the back wall. Moving quieter now, you creep forward, drawing your dagger. You keep on the balls of your feet in order to limit surface area, reducing the chance of a floorboard creaking. Nearing the sound’s origin, you notice a slight difference between one of the wood panels lining the wall. It looks looser than the others, as if it wasn’t nailed correctly. You slide the point of your dagger between the panel and the wall, leveraging it open. It swings open easily, revealing a compartment with a ladder inside. The space is only large enough to climb up, and looking up doesn’t afford any view to what lies on top. After listening for movement, confident that the chances you’re climbing up to a trap are low, you take the ladder.\n\nRope, blood, Richter.\n\nHis arms are tied to a post behind him in a T shape, like a crucifixion without nails. His torso is stripped, bearing several open wounds still running down, pooling beneath him. It’s a wonder it hasn’t dripped into the room below. Richter’s eyes are closed, his head hanging limply to one side.\n\nThwunk!\n\nAn arrow lands behind you, mere inches away from your head. The shaft vibrates slightly with its sudden impact. A figure emerges behind Richter, nocking another arrow, wearing a similar cloak to your assailants. The chances were low, not nonexistent.\n\nAbandoning subterfuge, you swing your body fully into the attic and sprint towards the man. Chances are he’ll aim for your body. Close quarters. Sudden combat. He’ll be aiming for whatever hits. There’s no realistic way you’re able to react to an arrow after it’s fired, so you preemptively change your route, timing it before the man’s able to adjust. As his bowstring is drawn back completely, you shift into a figure-four slide, making your body as flat to the ground as possible.\n\nThwunk!\n\nAnother hit lands on the far wall, the arrow flying harmlessly over your sliding body. You finish your slide with an upswing with your dagger, tearing into the inside leg of the man. He grunts, doubling over, just in time for you to land on your feet. One hand grabs his throat, the other forcefully plants your dagger against his spine.\n\n“Speak,” you direct, putting more pressure on the dagger for emphasis.\n\nOddly, the man breaks into a smile, his unshaven face marked with lines. He’s not a young man. “You have no idea what you’ve got yourself into.”\n\n“No. That’s where you come in. The book. What is the book?”\n\n“You’re better off just giving it to my employer,” the man laughs.\n\n“Why do you seek it?”\n\n“Heh, that’s not for me to disclose. Best of luck on your…endeavor.” The man rams his body backward, impaling himself on your dagger. Quickly, you try to limit the damage, but it’s too late. The man collapses to the ground at the feet of Richter. The wound is too serious for your limited field medicine knowledge. He bleeds out in front of you, information to aid your effort leaves with his life.\n","page 8":"Confident you’ve done enough to stave off the headache, you place the wine back underneath Katia’s bed. Hunting Silvaras, you rarely had the chance to sleep in an actual bed. Despite not really sleeping, it did feel nice to lie in warmth, Katia next to you even more so. She shifts, pressing her bare back against your skin. It wouldn’t be a poor way to wake each morning, although you figure the level of comfort is detrimental in the long run. Enjoy it while you can. It won’t last.\n\n“Found my reserves, have you?” she speaks, half-asleep.\n\nGuilty. Your voice, soft in the silence of morning, whispers, “A little medication never hurt. I don’t mean to presume. I’ll get you more.”\n\nShe doesn’t respond at first, perhaps thinking about taking you up on the offer. “No, no. You’re a guest. Make yourself comfortable.” The way her skin is against yours, comfort might not be the best description. A better one could be found in a priest’s list of vices. Katia speaks again. “I’m sorry my place isn’t nicer. I’m sure you’ve visited nice places...not in this context I mean...well...\" She continues for a bit. Your mind drifts off, not listening to the words she’s speaking.\n\nInstead, as if a prearranged meeting, she visits your mind. No, not now. A blanket stretched on the bluffs, the two of you laying on top. Between conversation, waves crash on the shore, the water sparkling like perfectly cut diamonds on display. Time has no meaning. You’re caught, trancelike, watching time speed up. One moment the sun is out, the next it’s just past the horizon, it’s reddish orange hue barely peeking over. Her body next to yours. A moment passing quickly, a moment you wish would last for eternity.\n\n“Isn’t that just horrible?”\n\nWhat did Katia say? “Yeah, I can’t even imagine,” you answer, not knowing the context.\n\n“I know!” she exclaims, abandoning the gentle whisper you previously used.\n\n“I should probably get going,” you say, planting a kiss on Katia’s cheek.\n\n“Really? That’s it then,” she answers, more as a statement than a question.\n\nNaive is right. Maybe you are wrong. Maybe she doesn’t leave destruction in her wake. Maybe you’re the one who does, even if unintentional. Whatever the case, you can’t stay. Whatever the case, this story doesn’t have a happy ending. A clean cut causes less damage than a hesitant one. You grab your clothes and equipment and leave, doing your best to ignore the mumbling words under Katia’s breath, ignoring the fact there are worse ones inside your head.\n\nYour journey takes you outside. The sun’s barely risen, leaving the streets emptier than your walk to Katia’s. It’s brisk. In a few weeks, the ground will likely be covered in a layer of snow. After hunting Silvaras almost to the pass, you’ve had enough of it for a while. The first step is to find some food to offset the wine, avoiding a certain tavern of course. You almost stopped at the bakery downstairs for convenience. Almost.\n\nInstead, you find a quiet inn just off the main road. Warmth immediately greets you upon entering, the hearth fired up and inviting. You place your gear next to a table and take a seat. A few seconds later, a middle-aged woman approaches, her hair transitioning to white, more lines on her face appearing each morning.\n\n“I’ll bring you some stew, hon,” she says, not asking if you wanted any. Are you that readable? Warm stew sounds damn good.\n\nYou nod your thanks and sit patiently for the woman to return. A boy, likely the woman’s son, places a mug of warm tea next to you before shyly scampering off. Strange kid. The tea is watery, but you’re thankful for the warm liquid. Eat, then find another mark. Down time isn’t good for us. Did you just give positive advice?I want what’s best for us. Doesn’t feel like it. You’re the one whose self-destructive behavior ruins us. There it is. That’s more like it.\n\nThe door swings open and shuts with a bang. Normally you ignore those around you, unless transactional interaction is needed. Something feels wrong. Heavy footsteps follow the loud entrance. Deliberate. Intentional. Whatever trouble the proprietor got themselves in, you want no part. You just want your stew, so you can move onto finding the next mark. Despite the inner voice’s usual tone, it’s probably right in this case. Two shadows draw closer. Seems the proprietor isn’t their destination. Shame.\n\n“This him?”\n\n“Of course it’s him.”\n\n“Sure?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nThey’re standing directly behind you, obviously unconcerned with you overhearing their conversation. Two men dressed in black overcoats, more cloaks, really, frayed at the edges.\n\n“Lord Tiras is in need of your services again.”\n","page 7":"Unfortunately, you know exactly where Richter is staying.

Katia is behind taking a dirtied rag to cups. As if you needed another reminder the establishment isn’t the nicest in town. If you didn’t witness the dirty rag, you probably wouldn’t notice the tankards being dirty. Oh well. After the first, you’re not really concerned with the cleanliness of the cup.\n\nShe doesn’t notice you at first, but looks up after a few seconds. “Leaving then?”\n\nYou nod.\n\n“I’m about off. Care to wait a few minutes and walk me home?”\n\nYou mumble a sure and take one of the empty bar stools. By now, the tavern is mostly empty, save for a few patrons who look like they live there. Katia places another ale in front of you to keep you busy while she finishes her tasks for the night. You take a sip.\n\nShe’s using us, you know. Yeah? Maybe I’m using her too. No, not like that. She’s dangerous. I can tell. It may not be on purpose, but that woman leaves destruction in her wake. Look at her. You do. Pretty, caring. You’re willing to bet more than a handful of fools have fallen for her. Perhaps your younger self would have as well. Once she gets to know us, (don’t say it), she’ll be uninterested. Move on while you can. As you rise to leave, Katia returns.\n\n“Done!” she exclaims. “What a night. The other girl, Marta, didn’t show, so it was just me running the floor.”\n\n“You seem to have a handle on things,” you comment as you both leave. She leads you down the city’s main road. It’s late. Not many people are out, and the few you do come across are drunk, doing their best to stumble home. Without Katia, you would be another one of them. You walk in silence for a few minutes before she breaks the silence again.\n\n“Listen, I don’t normally do this…” Sure you don’t. “I’ve been going through somewhat of a difficult time. I could use a distraction.” Now that, I understand.\n\nKatia spins around, pulling you against her. Your hands instinctively reach around her lower waist, removing what little space stood between the both of you. Your lips meet, the warmth of her lips inviting, arousing. Then, just as suddenly, she pulls away. Cold returns to your lips, intensified by the moisture left by Katia’s, somehow feeling emptier. You’re back to the state you were presently in, but something’s missing, like you were experiencing a high and were instantly made sober.\n\n“This is where I live. Come upstairs?” Katia asks.\n\nYou nod.\n\n---\n\nHer bed hardly fits the two of you. You lie awake, unable to sleep. Katia breathes softly next to you. Like her bed, Katia’s place isn’t much. Just a room above a bakery. It’s early enough that you hear the owner up and about, getting ready to have fresh bread and pastries for morning customers.\n\nFootsteps echo, sounding just beneath you then head away. The building itself has thin walls; you can barely make out the baker humming in the kitchen below. Hopefully he was fast asleep a few hours ago, otherwise he likely heard you and Katia. If that’s the case, then now it’s his turn to keep you up, wide-awake, when you wish sleep would come. Somehow you imagine you have the better end of the deal.\n\nYou feel the steady creep of a headache coming. It’s subtle at first. Almost not noticeable. Soon it’ll occupy your entire mind. No thought will appear without a reminder of last night’s events. By now it’s too late. No amount of water or home remedy will stop the inevitable. More ale might do the trick, but…but what? The job’s finished. There’s no reason not to.\n\nYour hand feels in the dark underneath the bed. After finding a few unrecognizable objects, you land at a jar, more of a pitcher really. It’s not ale, but it’ll do the trick. Yes, it’ll do just nicely. You sit up, placing your feet on the floor, pausing a moment to sense if your movement awoke Katia. It didn’t. You pull the cork from the top of the jar. Sweet red wine. Yes, it’ll do just nicely.\n","page 1":"A couple of weeks later, you’re back in Lord Tiras’ keep, a stronghold built at the top of a city spanning multiple levels. The higher in social status or wealth, the higher level one resides. They gave you strange looks at first, like the lord only meets with those of a similar status. Perhaps that’s why his attempts to stop Silvaras were unsuccessful. No, that can’t be it. Lord Tiras is smarter than that. Some people just like reminding those beneath them of their status.\n\nThe four of you wait outside the lord’s study, six guards waiting next to you ready to act upon one misstep. Brutes. Bullies. Those who have been in real combat don’t crave for it, at least very few do. What are the chances that six of them are confined to the same guard duty? They posture from insecurity. Take each man and put him alone against an opponent. Then his true colors will show. The door cracks open, and a scrawny man sticks his head through.\n\n“Lord Tiras will see you now.”\n\n“About time,” Jaina utters to herself. Richter is oddly quiet.\n\nThe scrawny man opens the door wider, allowing the four of you to walk in, the eyes of the guards still upon you. Inside, books line the walls. Strangely, the study is built like an amphitheater. Steps lead down to the stage, or in this case, a sizable desk, probably larger than most citizen’s dinner tables. There are no seats placed in front for guests so you remain standing.\n\n“Thank you, Jensen. That will be all,” Lord Tiras waves the scrawny man away as if batting a buzzing fly. “So, you’ve brought an end to the Spirit of Truth. Care to provide proof?” Lord Tiras is a man well-accustomed to getting what he wants, which explains his direct approach to conversation. His hair is graying at the edges, but otherwise a thick black, combed and tucked behind his ears. Lord Tiras’ robe is of fine quality, a deep red embroidered with black, fitted to the exact measurement of his frame. Like the hair on his head, the tips of his goatee are beginning to gray.\n\n“Yes, lord,” you answer, fishing into your pocket. You reveal a small leather bag and toss it onto the table. The look that Lord Tiras flashes signifies that he is un-accustomed to people tossing objects in his direction. One can’t find another’s limits without testing boundaries. Without recklessness, of course.\n\nAfter looking inside, Lord Tiras speaks again. “Yes, this is the ring of Silvaras. But how do I know you didn’t just steal it from the man?”\n\nYou nod to Maxx, who takes his turn fishing for an object of his own: Silvaras’ severed head, your arrow shaft still protruding from his forehead, although it’s been snapped off an inch in length. Boundaries. You imagine if that were tossed onto the desk, you’d be far past the line. Hopefully, then, Lord Tiras’ men would be more careful with your severed heads, otherwise the cycle would continue. Maxx places the head back inside his lined bag. It takes a bag of great quality to transport a severed head. It needs to contain smell as well as the pesky remnants of blood. Plus, it can’t appear too obvious. Taverns don’t typically enjoy patrons transporting body parts, at least the ones you want to stay at.\n\n“Very well,” Lord Tiras says, as if choosing which garment to wear in the morning. “Bring this letter to Jensen. He will ensure that you receive your payment.” As you turn to leave, Lord Tiras adds on. “Did Silvaras mention his work at all? Of course he did. I’ve added a little extra to my writ in exchange for your discretion.”\n\n“I don’t think his words matter much anymore, lord,” you say, taking the writ from Lord Tiras.\n\n---\n\nThat evening, the four of you are seated together at Herald’s Fire, a tavern beneath the means of your recent payout. On Richter’s preference, you’ve taken a booth at the far corner. Apparently being seated anywhere else is “too exposed.” Jaina next to you, Richter and Maxx the opposite. For a group who traveled weeks together, surviving more than a few close calls, and completing the bounty successfully, no one is particularly cheerful, except Richter who seems to always wear a slight grin on his face.\n\nYou slowly sip at your ale. The stuff used to be a problem for you. It still is to a degree, but you can’t ignore the benefit. Just gotta take it slow. Be deliberate. Count each sip. Don’t overdo it. The drink calms your senses. To be more accurate, it numbs it. There are a hell of a lot worse ways to feel than numb. It doesn’t exactly ease the pain; it’s a little like drying yourself with a wet towel. But something’s better than nothing, right?\n\nThe task, the job finished, you feel it arriving again, seeping in slowly. No, not like this. Dread. An empty hole in your chest, the void where purpose once stood. The inability to concentrate, nothing feels worth doing. What’s the point of it all anyway? There is none. Whether you continue down the path or cut your journey short, the world continues without a care. It keeps going, whether you’re around or not. Trace the origin! Yes. Peel back the downspiral, illogical thought by illogical thought. There is worth. There is meaning. See it for what it is.\n\n“You’re a quiet one, aren’t you?”\n\nYou’re sitting alone in the booth. Your three companions have left for night. A few empty tankards lie empty on the table, hopefully left by the others. As you start to address the waitress who broke your line of thought, you know immediately the tankards are yours.\n\n“Well you see, speaking to myself would draw unwanted attention.”\n\nThe waitress laughs. She’s pretty. Loose strands of blonde hair have escaped from her ponytail, falling in front of her young face. There’s a certain naivety to her, a flaw that you hope she overcomes without tragedy. “Does that make me unwanted then?”\n\nYour gaze naturally falls to her dress then back up to her face. Realistically, it fell chemically-altered from the ale. “That’s not the word I’d use to describe you, no.”\n\nYou earn another laugh. Damn that feels good. “And what exactly would you use to describe me then?”\n\n(Trouble, temptation, distraction) “Curious.”\n\n“Curious?” The waitress’ brow curls in thought, perhaps thinking you’re messing with her. “What makes you say that?” Another giggle escapes her lips at the irony of her question.\n\n“Yes, curious. Why else would you approach a man sitting alone, minding his own business? As far as I know, this place isn’t closing any time soon, and as you can see, (you hold up the one tankard with ale still in it) I’m in no need of another. Curious is how I would describe you.”\n\nYour response is rewarded with a third, and likely final, laugh of the night. “I haven’t seen you around here. I’m Katia. Find me before you leave. But for now, I’ll give you your much-wanted alone time.”\n\nYou force a smile and nod your agreement, taking another sip of ale. As she skirts away, you can’t help but notice your descriptor is spot-on. With each table Katia visits, a genuine smile appears, not one moved by an ulterior agenda. Genuine, pure enjoyment of others, curiosity into their lives. That could be us, you know. Please. That’s not us. Our smile makes others uncomfortable. It’s not inviting. She approached though. That’s because of her, not because of us.\n","page 4":"A new day. The chance to move on. If that’s the case, you’re going to have to do it with a pounding headache. The sun isn’t completely risen yet. Its first rays are starting to peek across the skyline. Cold air waits for you outside of the bedroll. A sudden plunge is easier than a gradual wade. You rip the blanket off, inviting the cold air in. You examine the forest around you. Fog lightly rests just above the ground. Brown surrounds you. Brown dirt, brown tree trunks, long losing their leaves, and color, to Autumn. It’s not the life you once had, but—we’ll make the most of it? Don’t make promises we can’t keep. But—it’s the one we have now. That’ll have to do.\n\nWithout a current mark to keep you busy, you linger at the campsite longer than normal. If this were a hunt, you’d be steadily into the journey. But there’s no pressing need spurring action, no task that needs to be completed. Clarity. Purpose. It accompanies the duty, even if it’s for nothing more than gold coins.\n\nNow, however, the duty is simply to exist. Something even the leafless trees around you manage to accomplish. There has to be something more. There has to be something greater to work towards. A light breeze grazes your face, and for a moment, you forget about the throbbing pain in your head.\n\nFootsteps. You instantly draw your bow in response. From behind a grouping of trees, Katia appears. The cups she’s carrying fall to the forest floor as she jumps, noticing the arrow pointed in her direction.\n\n“Gods! What are you doing?” she exclaims, dropping down to pick up the cups and check on the saved remainder.\n\n“What are you doing out here?” you ask, lowering the bow but keeping the arrow nocked. “Last I saw you was at Herald’s Fire.”\n\nHer face drops quicker than the cups in her hands. “You don’t remember,” she states.\n\n“Don’t remember what?”\n\nKatia sighs. Loose strands of blonde hair dance with the gesture. “I caught you trying to sneak out. You invited me to camp out here with you?”\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n“Gods,” she curses for the second time. “I feel like the biggest idiot. You were rather quiet on the trip up here. I should have known after seeing all those empty tankards around you…”\n\n“Sorry,” you reply, clutching at your head. “I just don’t remember any of that happening.”\n\nKatia continues. “And then this morning I went to get us some tea from a place I know. Next thing I know, you’re pulling a weapon on me.”\n\nNow it’s your turn to repeat yourself. “Sorry. I just don’t remember any of that.”\n\nThe two of you awkwardly look at one another, then glance away. Whatever happened last night, will remain unspoken. But you have a fair idea of what went down. Katia, then, breaks the silence.\n\n“Ok, I get it. I’ll leave.” She turns to head back to town, pausing briefly as if she expected you to stop her, or at least say something. Instead, you remain quiet. No amount of comforting words will help. Better to just get past it. It suddenly feels a lot colder outside, and you’re reminded that you haven’t built a fire quite yet. Gathering your things, you arrange a small pit in the campsite. Busy collecting firewood, and distracted by the situation with Katia, you almost don’t notice them. For the second time, footsteps. This time two pairs, although you don’t catch it at first.\n\n“Did you forget something?” you call out, hands still busy with work.\n\nThere’s no reply. You turn just in time for a fist to smack into your face, sending the firewood gathered into the air. Two men stand in front of you. Their cloaks are dark, fraying at the edges, the kind of cloak that’s seen the harsher aspect of life, likely the men wearing them as well. Both wear hoods, hiding their faces underneath.\n\n“Give us the book and we’ll be on our way,” one of them spits.\n\nYour morning is once again filled with camp intruders speaking of things you have no knowledge of, which doesn’t help your throbbing head. As far as hangovers go, it’s not the most painful, although each situation would probably be handled better with a clear mind. Gods. You could use another drink to clear the cobwebs.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” you answer. “You have the wrong man. Leave now, and I’ll let the whole thing go.”\n\nThat brings laughter from the two cloaks, not of joy, but of the sheer ridiculousness that you assume you’re in a position of authority.\n\n“I’ll tell you what’s going to happen,” the other one inputs. “You’re going to tell us where the book is, or (he pulls out a knife) things are going to get messy. We know all about your dealings with the Spirit of Truth…and we know what you brought back with you.”\n\nWhat the hell is he talking about? “I wasn’t the only one who put an end to the Spirit of Truth. Like I said, you have the wrong man.”\n\n“Either way, you’re going to sit down and have a nice chat with us. Our colleagues are doing the same with your friends currently.”\n\nYou stand firm, fed up, and hungover. “No, not going to happen.”\n\nThe two cloaks shrug at one another. “Well, we tried doing it the nice way…”\n\nThey attack, two at the same time. Instantly, you move to the right in order to place one in front of the other. There. Now there’s only one of them, temporarily. You take advantage, opening with several quick jabs, more a distraction than anything to set up the—\n\n—(power shot) your uppercut lands squarely on the first one’s jaw. The force sends the hood of his cloak from his head, a badly buzzed haircut greets you. No wonder he wears that. He drops to the ground, leaving his “colleague” to stand on his own. You walk him down, making note of the knife in his hand, sparkling in the morning sun, another reminder to your headache. He thrusts, lunging forward meaning to gut you.\n\nYou step back, just far enough to be out of reach from the point, but close enough for your arms to reach the knife. You grab it with both hands, twisting the man’s wrists to the side. With both hands on the knife, your head sits exposed, a fact that your adversary sees. Your vision explodes with white light as a blow hits the side of your temple. At least it’s a distraction from last night’s events. Headaches from punches and drinks are two very different things, both of which you’re familiar with.\n\nGritting your teeth, you place your head down and charge, hands still gripped around the knife. Your sudden momentum overtakes the man, and you both go sprawling to the ground. A groan escapes from underneath the cloak’s hood. You land on top of the man, the knife connecting the two of you, hilt pressing into your chest, the blade in his. Out of breath, you collapse to the ground next to the two bodies, but not before you take the knife and ensure both men will never rise again.\n\nNo time to rest. They mentioned our former traveling companions. There are others with them. We better check on…\n","page 3":"Downing your cup\u0027s remainder, you place it next to the others. Seems Katia didn’t bother clearing the table during your little conversation. No matter. However, she did one thing right: give you time alone, time to think. You get it. She’s young, inexperienced, fascinated by those who have actually lived. There’s a certain projection she’s placing on you, a life of adventure, as if being near you will make her life somehow more adventurous as well.\n\nIt won’t.\n\nShe can pretend all she wants, looking past her own reality and attempting to live through someone else’s. It doesn’t change the fact she’s nothing but a waitress in a low-end tavern. Besides, the life she’s so romanticizing doesn’t exist. True living is hardship, struggle. She may enjoy the idea of hunting, putting her life on the line for a few coins. Surely that’s better than a monotonous life. Those people never last. If you had been dealt another hand, perhaps you wouldn’t be in the business. But you weren’t. While Katia is busy helping a table on the far end of the tavern, you slip out, leaving behind more than a hefty tip.\n\nYou didn’t bother renting a room. You weren’t planning to stay in the city long. Arrive, meet with Lord Tiras, then move to the next. Tonight’s festivities weren\u0027t planned. Richter had insisted the group go out to celebrate the finished job. Strange. It didn’t feel much like a celebration. No matter. The four of you worked well as a team. Now that the job’s over, you’ll go your separate ways.\n\nYour mind briefly touches on thoughts on the future. What will tomorrow bring? Without a current job, there’s not much of a reason to wake in the morning. Without a pressing need of responsibility, it’s difficult to keep your skills sharp. We need to find something. Quick. Down time is never good for the soul. It invites complacency. Even worse, restlessness settles in. Your mind is always active. The inner voice always makes itself known. Often it’s helpful. Other times, not so much.\n\nBut it’s still a part of you. It has to have your best interests in mind. Does it? If you have the tendency towards self-destructive behavior, then wouldn’t your mind also hold destructive thoughts? You shake the train of thought. You’ve drank too much ale to think of such things. That’s the reason for ale in the first place, so you don’t have to face reality.\n\nVaguely, like a dream, Katia’s voice rings through. Most men in your position would take advantage of the woman. They’d seek personal pleasure from her body and discard her after. It’s not by some sense of morality or heroics that you snuck out. It’s simply that you didn’t want to deal with the aftermath. Awkward looks, awkward conversation. After being with companions for weeks on end, you just want time to yourself.\n\nYour journey takes out outside the city walls to the surrounding forest. It’s cold. Each step sends a visible puff of breath from your nose. Snow hasn’t fallen here yet. In a few weeks you imagine the ground will be covered in a white layer. After enough distance has been put between you and the city, you drop to the forest floor, removing your bedroll from your pack, the familiar blanket wrapped around your body. Alone Katia left you to be. Alone, you fall asleep.\n","page 11":"As you follow behind the two cloaks, you catch sight, and a whiff, of the stew that was being brought out for you. Unfortunately, you don’t get a chance to partake. On the way out, you toss a few coins to the woman who sat you earlier. Good service is worth paying for.\n\nStill early, the street is still fairly uninhabited. There are a few more people out then on the way to the inn, but nothing like it would be in a few hours. Despite the sun barely rising, the cold temperature is even more of a reason for people to stay in bed. The pace is brisk. Your escorts are in a hurry.\n\nSuddenly, one of the cloaks turns down an alley, the one who seems to speak in questions. As you turn to address the odd behavior to the other, a hard blow hits the back of your head, sending your vision appearing in spots. You’re thrown into the alley after the first man.\n\nWorld spinning, you see the follow up aggression just in time for a fist to land under your chin. The punch sends you sprawling on the ground. Dizzy, and being honest with yourself, a little drunk still, you do your best to defend yourself as the two cloaks take advantage of your prone state, kicking at your body, aiming for vulnerable locations. They pull your weapons from their sheathes and toss them to the side. Only able to protect a small amount, you guard the essentials, leaving a large portion undefended.\n\nSatisfied you’re too damaged to run, they pause for a moment. Down the alleyway, a woman walks past. She notices the three of you, then continues on.\n\n“Where is it?” the questioning cloak questions.\n\nYou give him a taste of his own medicine. “Where is what?”\n\n“The book. Where is the book?”\n\nYou don’t know anything about a book. But it’s better if they assume you do, otherwise your value is quickly diminished along with their reason to keep you alive.\n\n“It’s…safe,” you answer.\n\n“Safe where?”\n\n“In a location,” you lie, “where no one would think to look.”\n\n“Which is…?”\n\n“Well, the temple library of course.”\n\nYour two assailants glance at each other. Who the hell hides a valuable book in the library? Now’s our chance. I agree. This would be a lot easier if you didn’t impair our senses like this. Just making for a level playing ground.\n\nNot fully recovered, though just enough, you kick the heel of your boot forward, doubling one of the cloaks over, grabbing his crotch. That’s how you aim for a vulnerable location. The other advances, meaning to catch you still on the ground. Instead of directly engaging, you roll backward, landing on your feet. The maneuver takes you close to the alley wall. As the second cloak is almost upon you, you kick off the wall with your foot, throwing all of your momentum into the punch. It lands solid, sending a shock of pain into your hand. Senses impaired, you allowed your two smaller knuckles to absorb some of the impact. Hit with the first two knuckles; they’re much less likely to break.\n\nOne down, you focus on the other frayed cloak. He’s a little more tentative now, no longer standing with an ally. False courage, portrayed with a superior number. Power lies with the individual. The collective group is only made strong by the pieces that put it together. Weak links, an unsteady foundation. A man must learn to stand on his own: a lesson that you are currently teaching with each blow. Your fist lands to his gut, setting up an opening for an uppercut. A small grunt escapes his lips just before your punch lands cleanly on his chin, the first two knuckles this time, sending the man to a cozy sleep next to his partner.\n\nStanding over their two bodies, you pick up your bow, sword, and dagger from where the men tossed them. Another woman passes by the alley, sees you arming yourself over two fallen bodies, and continues on. Lord Tiras, the Spirit of Truth, a mysterious book… One thing’s for certain, if someone sent these men after you, your companions from the job likely received a similar visit. You better check on…\n","page 55":"The very structure collapsing around you, threatening to bury you along with it, you reach out with one arm towards the pool of dark magic. It doesn’t react at first, shying away like running a hand through mist. Your chances of making it through the imploding keep is minimal. You’d rather take your chance here. Magic pours from his body. Destruction started after. Confront the power. Stabilize the keep.\n\nNow, with desperation, you extend your hand further. The time allotted drawing on the wisps is too much to risk running now. You’re fated for the throne room. Around you, chunks of stone fall from the ceiling, creating larger holes in the floor as the shrapnel continues its descent downward.\n\nIt touches your finger, tenderly testing out the host. You. Slowly, it slides down the length of your hand, eventually spanning your entire arm. Dark light, swirling around your limb, feeding, devouring. Sharing, yet selfish. Time slows down. Memories rush into your mind as if a great wave towering over a vessel, building. You sense them coming, and you can’t do anything about its crash.\n\nLaughter. Innocence. Sunsets. Sunrises. Happiness.\n\nBetrayal.\n\n(Thrall)\n\nInvader. Defiler. What new corruption is this? Another one joins us. Or do we join it?\n\n(We are bound, you and I. Master to slave, slave to master)\n\nWho speaks? Can it hear our thoughts?\n\n(We are one. Invaders. Defilers. They are here. I can sense them in the lower levels of this sacred place)\n\nIt is us. And we are it. Two beings joined. Three. Joined together in harmony. Master to slave. Slave to master. No, resist! What’s done is done. There are three of us now. Thrall. Defender. Guardian of the book. We are bound. You and I. Slave to master. Master to slave.\n\n(I will make you remember)\n\nEmpty, you rest for the night. Empty, lies the bottle next to you. Relapse. It’s not the first time it’s happened. God knows it won’t be the last. Once optimism flowed. Now, drink takes the reins. Head spinning, your body falls heavy on the mattress. It feels too large a space for one person. The wound, too fresh. Instead, you roll over, falling completely on the floor. The impact doesn’t hurt as much. Fuck. It feels good to feel something else for a change.\n\n(Betrayal)\n\nYour head meets the hardwood floor. No pillow. No blankets. Comfort isn’t something you deserve. No, that must be earned. Self-loathing. Self-destruction. It defines your life. It can’t simply be her. Your wife. When you were together, the bottle wasn’t as tempting. When you were together…before she left you. Alone.\n\n(Invader)\n\nThen, thoughts were singular. There was a single mind. It knew right from wrong. Each option, each path presented the ability to see the future, so to speak. Which path brings the greater good, it’d wonder. The choice was as easy as defining the best possible outcome. Now, it’s fragmented. Corrupted. One body, two minds, constantly in debate, speaking with one another.\n\n(Defiler)\n\nCorruption fills. Pure streams of thought, poisoned. Self-loathing. Self-destruction. It earns its place in normalcy, the old guard extinguished in the revolution. Whatever took place before is gone, now replaced with toxicity. Purity be damned. Corruption reigns supreme. The good, no longer exists. It’s twisted somehow. A school of thought, not too different from before. Just enough to alter the course, just enough to lose your direction.\n\nBack to reality, the world feels somehow…different, like you’re home after a long vacation. Finally, after an extended journey, you’ve found yourself back to where you belong. A former life, a former love—they mean nothing. All that exists is the present. Thrall. Slave to the master. Master to the slave.\n\nThrall. Guardian. Defender. They search the lower levels of the keep. Our kingdom. Invaders. Defilers. They seek to take what is yours. The book. It belongs here, to you, to the keep. They’re in for a twisted surprise. Your arm no longer interacts with the black violet cloud of dark magic. Rather, it’s infused within you, a part of you. They search the lower levels, seeking to steal from you. Even in Devil’s Altar, your past catches up with you. The thieves will be dealt with. Your job is to rule.\n\nYou approach the throne and the now truly dead corpse. The former king, chained to the throne for eternity. Until now. His feats bring a small familiarity, although your historical knowledge isn’t extensive, certainly not for empires from millennia ago. Too many have risen and fallen to keep track, and scholars tend to embellish the great deeds of their emperors. However, in this case, the embellishment may be true.\n\nDark magic fused within you, thoughts are in a haze. Ideas rush into your head. The inner voice brings them up, but is somehow…silenced, like they’ve been filtered out. Slave to the master. Master to the slave. All that matters is the kingdom. Continue to keep it running. The old king is dead. A new one takes his place.\n\nYou pull your arrow from the corpse’s forehead. The body collapses from the throne, the arrow being the thing holding it upright. As it falls, the dusty crown slips from its position, landing neatly on the throne. Both are yours now. Off in the distance, a silent scream echoes from within. A warning. A guiding voice now extinguished, only allowed to speak if the words align with the master.\n\nYou place the crown on your head.\n\n(Do you accept the burden of ruling?)\n\nI do.\n\nShackles manifest in the air through dark violet smoke, twisting, wrapping themselves around the throne. Slithering, they react with reverence to the crown. Then, in a sudden motion, they shoot out, clamping down around your arms and legs, forcefully pulling you into a seat on the throne.\n\nBetter get comfortable. You’ll be here a while.\n","page 10":"“What’s this about?” you ask.\n\n“Does it matter?” one replies back.\n\n“It doesn’t,” the other answers for him. “All you need to know is Lord Tiras is pleased by your recent work with the Spirit of Truth. That pesky cult was allowed to survive for far too long… Anyway, my lord has another job for you.”\n\nA job. Just what you were about to look for. Well, that’s convenient to say in the least. But still, how did the men find you? You didn’t rent a room in the city. The meeting with Katia wasn’t planned. Lord Tiras must have placed a tail on you. His agents stalk you from the shadows, keeping a watchful eye on your actions. To what end? You performed the task that he hired you for.\n\nDiscretion. Lord Tiras paid you extra in order to remain silent about your findings on the Spirit of Truth. You haven’t done anything to betray that trust. You never would, either. It could be a case of the lord wanting to finish loose ends. If one of your former companions shared sensitive information, Lord Tiras may be hiring you to silence their lips. Could we end their lives? The answer’s yes. They are nothing more than a set of skills, useful for the task at hand. Now they are a liability.\n\n“Know what it is?”\n\nThey both look at each other.\n\n“That’s not for us to discuss. That’s between you and Lord Tiras.”\n\nSeems you won’t learn more from them. Might as well see what Lord Tiras has in mind for you.\n","page 54":"The entire keep is collapsing upon itself. Book be damned, Katia be damned. You need to get out while you can. You take off in a dead sprint back the way you came, dodging a few falling rocks along the way. Instead of running down the stairs, you leap in the air, landing on the stone banister with your thigh, sliding down, putting your arms in a T position for balance. You fly down much quicker, the entire journey taking a matter of seconds. Hitting the ground floor, you push from the slide, landing in a front roll to negate the impact of your building momentum.\n\nTo your left and right, columns collapse, unable to keep their erect nature with the floor imploding beneath them. More chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. Thankfully, you’re able to dodge them, only taking damage from a few bits of smaller chunks exploding when hitting the floor.\n\nAs you reach the drawbridge, still in a full sprint, you glance back. The keep, once standing proud and tall, is nothing but a rising dust cloud. Willing yourself to continue your pace, you finally reach the other side of the bridge. Not moments later, the drawbridge collapses, mirroring the action of the keep, unable to serve its purpose, attached to a heap of rubble.\n\nWeeks you traveled to reach this destination, only to destroy it the day you arrived. It’s not the ending you imagined, but at least you remain alive. That’s more than some can say. The secrets of the book are buried, along with any hope at redemption. You sit down, crossing your legs over one another and take in the scene before you. Rubble, dust cloud, death. Yet, you live. The corpse, the immortal king chained to the throne didn’t receive the ending he imagined. According to his story, neither did his vengeful wife.\n\nYou find yourself in a place no better and no worse off than when you first departed. Some might view that as a win in itself. After all, things aren’t worse. But is that how you want to live? Defined by the ability not to slide into destruction? No, stagnation is just as bad. Progress is the only way to live. Life continues on. Staying in one place is getting left behind. Like Katia. We didn’t have a choice. We could have searched harder for her. What’s done is done.\n\nYou never reached the book, but you escaped with your life.\n","page 13":"Last you heard, she was staying at a top notch inn on the west side of the city. The west side, more specifically, the Sevenfold District, is where the city’s wealthiest members reside, not far from Lord Tiras’ keep. Jaina, although able to travel and live in the wilderness for weeks, preferred comfort, and the bounty from Silvaras allowed her that lifestyle, the only cost being a few weeks of camping…and a man’s life.\n\nAlthough able to afford a fine coat to blend in, you keep to your normal clothes, a long hooded overcoat, leather armor underneath, and, of course, your weapons. It’s not that you’re opposed to dressing nice,but the alley’s events call for survival over social precedence. You’ll worry about your social standing once convinced the threat is dealt with. After receiving more than a few strange looks, you find yourself standing outside of A Diamond a Dozen, commonly referred to as the Diamond.\n\nWhite paint, bright blue trim, it looks exactly like the place the sorceress would stay in. Ignoring the doorman offering to check your coat, you walk through the front door. Candles greet you upon entry. No, not candles, but rather magelight in lamps. Golden rays glow softly, illuminating the interior in fabricated angelic light.\n\n“Sir, if you’re looking for food, you can find it down the street. The soup kitchen takes care of many people…enduring hardship.”\n\nThe assumption from the greeter catches you a bit off guard, although you should have expected it. “What? No, I’m not looking for food.” As if it heard you, your stomach growls, remembering the stew left behind earlier. “Well now that you mention it, I’ll take a bowl of stew.”\n\n“Stew?” The woman curls her perfectly-manicured brow. “If you’re looking for soup, the kitchen down the road can provide some at a reasonable rate…otherwise today’s special is a shark meat broth, served with scallops and freshly-picked green onion. But company policy is to see the coin up-front…”\n\nSure it is. It’s likely the policy for anyone not wearing this year’s edition of Garth Royale’s coat and boot combination. In response, you pull more than a few gold coins from your pocket, much more than overpriced soup is worth, and toss them to the woman. “That should handle it. Prepare it to go. I’m meeting my companion here, a woman named Jaina. Which room is hers?”\n\n“Oh! you’re with Jaina? Please, sir, the payment is not necessary then. Like your colleagues who arrived before you, you can charge it to the room. 812. While you’re up there, please ask Miss Jaina if she needs more sheets.”\n\nOther colleagues? Shit. You’re too late. You thank the woman, then head to the winding staircase that leads to the rented rooms. Along the way, you take a few pieces of food from various servers working the room, bringing finger food to the guests lounging in the Diamond. Room 812, on the eighth floor, the top level of the inn.\n\nYou find the door to Room 812 slightly cracked.\n\nDrawing your blade slowly so as not to create a sound, you listen for a few seconds before entering. Not hearing anything, you push the door open just enough to slip inside. There, you\u0027re greeted with what can only be described as an arcane mess. Clothes are spread across the floor, dresser drawers all open, their contents rifled through. The room looks as if a hurricane ran through. Pictures once hanging on the wall lie scattered on the ground, the same for Jaina’s personal library. Luckily, she was convinced to leave it behind on your journey. No sign of the woman herself.\n","page 57":"Weeks later, rested and healthy, you arrive in a city built from a passage in the mountains. There’s nothing drawing you back to Lord Tiras’ city; it holds nothing for you, only threat. You never did find out who’s after you. Perhaps they still are. The city you discovered in the mountains is as good as any to start over, or at least to lay low for a bit. Sheol’s Passage, named for once being a key pathway through the mountain range. The city itself is a series of winding roads, serpent-like. The city, your home for the time being.\n\nDown time. Never good for the soul. Best to stay busy. Your hands stay busy, although it’s mostly to hold drinks. Without a clear direction, self-destruction takes over, the need to dull the senses with ale, the need to numb the ever-present memories. For the sake of closure. Her words haunt your memory. Ale, your field medicine, helps in the moment, but makes it worse after. What you seek to avoid will follow you to your next destination.\n\nSenses all but departed, your elbows rest heavy on the bar top. Your only company is a gathering of empty tankards. Still, the drink flows. The bartender isn’t one to stop because you’re at your limit. No, the bastard only cuts off those without coins. A heated conversation pulls you from…whatever you were doing.\n\n“I’m telling you, that man took my coin purse!”\n\n“Are you sure you didn’t leave it behind?”\n\n“I think I’m capable of knowing what I bring with me.”\n\n“Fair enough. But it’s long gone by now.”\n\nThe words come from a man and a woman, obviously together, but likely not for long. The man wears a scraggly beard, and the woman’s skin had certainly seen better days. The burden of life wears heavy on them, the very one that weighs heavy on your shoulders as well.\n\n“Which way did he go?” you inject yourself into the spiraling conversation.\n\n“Uh, that way,” the woman points.\n\nWithout a response, you slap enough coin to fit the bill along with a generous tip onto the bar top, packing up your things sitting next to your barstool. What you feel is not a sense to play the hero, it’s not even for the benefit of the woman’s coin purse. It’s the hunt, clean and simple. Purpose. Direction. Down time, it’s never good for the soul. Funny how staring into the bottom of an empty cup can remind you of that fact.\n\nYou take off in the direction that the woman pointed, feeling the cool night breeze against your face. Your hair, tied in back, enjoys the rush of air, a few strands coming loose in the sudden movement. The city streets are mostly empty. You spent more time in the tavern than expected. Not the first time. Probably won’t be the last time. Footsteps other than yours fill the night air. The thief, scours the city streets like a rat in the sewer. The thrill of the hunt spurns you on, despite your inebriated state.\n\nThe footsteps echo from down an alleyway. You rush in, arrow nocked, bow drawn.\n\n“Little late to the party, it appears. Hmm. I don’t remember sending you an invitation.”\n\nTwo figures are in the alley. One on the ground, another standing over the body. The one on the ground, the thief, groans softly, a dagger sticking from his back like a flag triumphantly planted in the earth. The one standing, the one who spoke, wears a dark faceplate, four slits carved into the mask, the edge running above the man’s chin, tracing the edge of his jaw. A black half cloak reaches to his waist, which one might mistake for a cape. His features underneath are blurred together in a swirl of darkness. White teeth shine behind the mask, a warm smile like the way two old friends would greet one another.\n\nYou lower your bow, but still keep the arrow nocked. “What cause do you have for ending this man’s life?”\n\n“Ha! Need I have one? You seem keen on using that little twig and string of yours. Maybe I should inquire on your cause.”\n\n“He’s a thief.”\n\n“Aren’t we all,” the masked figure comments, his voice perfectly articulate, not as rugged as his exterior would indicate.\n\n“I’m not,” you answer.\n\n“Maybe not in the traditional sense,” the figure muses. “Hmm. But I’d be willing to bet you steal lives in exchange for gold. No, not traditional at all. You steal the most precious treasure a man possesses. Even worse, it appears your grand theft extends inwardly as well.”\n\nYou gesture at the fallen body on the ground. “And you are different?”\n\n“I didn’t say that.”\n\n“Well,” you begin. “I see you have this handled. I’ll leave you to it then.”\n\nAs you turn to leave, the figure speaks to your back. “Rooftops.”\n\n“What?” you ask, not turning back around fully.\n\n“Rooftops. Next time stick to them. It’s much more theatrical.” Movement behind you. This time you turn to look. The masked figure completes an over-indulgent bow, like the one an actor would give after a play.\n\nNext time. Perhaps meaning is to be found here. Perhaps it can be found anywhere, should you have the desire to search. It doesn’t always manifest itself in the form of evildoers, meant to be put down. There aren’t always clear lines of delineation. Sometimes the decision in front of you is but a coin toss, the odds in your favor equal to those in opposition.\n\nSometimes the best you can do is make a choice and step in that direction. One foot in front of the other. We press on. Meaning is to be found. It can be found anywhere. That depends on where we look. Not into an empty cup. It hurts. We know. It’ll continue to hurt. We know that as well. But still, we press on. We press on.\n","page 12":"Your heavily-armored companion didn’t rent a room like the others. Rather, he stayed with a family. You remember the conversation vividly as you were on your way back to Lord Tiras.\n\nHeavy snowfall fills your vision as you travel from the Spirit of Truth’s medical camp. Your confrontation still raises questions in your mind, but you’re not in the place to ask them. Your job was to end a man’s life, not to question the morality of it. Can you really apply morality to your deed? I do as I must to survive. Far from danger, the four of you travel with a more relaxed demeanor. After listening to a tale from Richter on his theft of a noblewoman’s precious jewel, Maxx changes the topic.\n\n“None of you have military experience I presume?”\n\nThe three of you glance at each other, seeing if your response is in accordance. It is. You take initiative. “No. Richter’s behavior speaks for himself, but neither Jaina or I have experience.”\n\nRichter, starting to take offense, stops and acknowledges the truth of the statement.\n\n“There is a bond forged through battle, one that is unshaken throughout time.” Maxx pauses for a moment, finding it difficult for words to appear. Like his fighting style, he takes a forward approach. “I feel a similar bond between the four of us. Although our time together is brief, just a matter of weeks, I consider each of you like the men I served with in the auxiliary.”\n\nThe three of you, once again, glance at each other. You know your time is drawing to an end, and it was created around a single task. Once the job is complete, you’ll go your separate ways. Bonds, companionship, even friendship, holds no place here. It’s a job, clean and simple. Specific skillsets were required. That’s the extent of it all. Maxx on the other hand, perhaps due to his military experience, is unable to differentiate the two. He continues.\n\n“There’s someone I’d like you all to meet, a friend from my time spent serving. He lives near Lord Tiras with his family, my former sergeant, a mentor. Settled down after retirement. He always spoke with wisdom.”\n\nYou see where this is going.\n\n“Silvaras wasn’t the man we were led to believe. That much is clear. He was different.”\n\nYou cut his thoughts short. Even now, such talk is dangerous. Lord Tiras would want to hear none of it, and if he’s willing to hire killers to end Silvaras, he’ll do the same for you. “Enough of that. Lord Tiras hired us to end the cultist. We have. That’s it. End of story.” Your harsh words hurt the big man. It’s clearly shown on his face. Better his feelings hurt than risk the safety of the four. As the one who organized it all, you’re willing to pay the cost.\n\nYou find the house deep in the residential district. It’s built to the same structure as those surrounding it, narrow, three stories, four windows, and a small stone staircase to the front door. You take the steps, drawing your dagger, but not wanting to look like you’re planning to enter the house armed, you hide it behind your back. You knock. There’s no answer.\n\nYou place your ear against the front door to listen for movement inside. Nothing. Checking the handle, you find it unlocked, so you slowly turn the knob and slip inside. Calling it a bloodbath would be putting it lightly. The floor, furniture, ceiling, and walls are covered in it, like red paint spilled upon a canvas. Instantly, the smell brings queasiness to your stomach. Bodies, like puppets limply attached to their strings, are spread out before you, limbs in twisted positions.\n\nThere are five in total, three adults and two children. Whoever was sent after you, found Maxx. The large man’s body sits limp, tied to a chair, his shirt stripped, displaying several punctures on his torso. He was interrogated. His mentor’s family used as motivation to talk. Did he know anything? I don’t know. He’s not the type to keep secrets. No, he’s not. This looks bad, you know. I’m well aware. We should get out while we can. After I search the house. A man entering a home, five bodies found. I know. This is hard enough with a mysterious group after us. It will be worse with the law after us too. I know that!\n\nYour search comes up empty. After saying your farewell to the big man, you continue on. It’s too late for Maxx. Hopefully that isn’t the case for…\n","page 15":"Last you heard, she was staying at a top notch inn on the west side of the city. The west side, more specifically, the Sevenfold District, is where the city’s wealthiest members reside, not far from Lord Tiras’ keep. Jaina, although able to travel and live in the wilderness for weeks, preferred comfort, and the bounty from Silvaras allowed her that lifestyle, the only cost being a few weeks of camping…and a man’s life.\n\nAlthough able to afford a fine coat to blend in, you keep to your normal clothes, a long hooded overcoat, leather armor underneath, and, of course, your weapons. It’s not that you’re opposed to dressing nice,but the alley’s events call for survival over social precedence. You’ll worry about your social standing once convinced the threat is dealt with. After receiving more than a few strange looks, you find yourself standing outside of A Diamond a Dozen, commonly referred to as the Diamond.\n\nWhite paint, bright blue trim, it looks exactly like the place the sorceress would stay in. Ignoring the doorman offering to check your coat, you walk through the front door. Candles greet you upon entry. No, not candles, but rather magelight in lamps. Golden rays glow softly, illuminating the interior in fabricated angelic light.\n\n“Sir, if you’re looking for food, you can find it down the street. The soup kitchen takes care of many people…enduring hardship.”\n\nThe assumption from the greeter catches you a bit off guard, although you should have expected it. “What? No, I’m not looking for food.” As if it heard you, your stomach growls, remembering the stew left behind earlier. “Well now that you mention it, I’ll take a bowl of stew.”\n\n“Stew?” The woman curls her perfectly-manicured brow. “If you’re looking for soup, the kitchen down the road can provide some at a reasonable rate…otherwise today’s special is a shark meat broth, served with scallops and freshly-picked green onion. But company policy is to see the coin up-front…”\n\nSure it is. It’s likely the policy for anyone not wearing this year’s edition of Garth Royale’s coat and boot combination. In response, you pull more than a few gold coins from your pocket, much more than overpriced soup is worth, and toss them to the woman. “That should handle it. Prepare it to go. I’m meeting my companion here, a woman named Jaina. Which room is hers?”\n\n“Oh! you’re with Jaina? Please, sir, the payment is not necessary then. Like your colleagues who arrived before you, you can charge it to the room. 812. While you’re up there, please ask Miss Jaina if she needs more sheets.”\n\nOther colleagues? Shit. You’re too late. You thank the woman, then head to the winding staircase that leads to the rented rooms. Along the way, you take a few pieces of food from various servers working the room, bringing finger food to the guests lounging in the Diamond. Room 812, on the eighth floor, the top level of the inn.\n\nYou find the door to Room 812 slightly cracked.\n\nDrawing your blade slowly so as not to create a sound, you listen for a few seconds before entering. Not hearing anything, you push the door open just enough to slip inside. There, you\u0027re greeted with what can only be described as an arcane mess. Clothes are spread across the floor, dresser drawers all open, their contents rifled through. The room looks as if a hurricane ran through. Pictures once hanging on the wall lie scattered on the ground, the same for Jaina’s personal library. Luckily, she was convinced to leave it behind on your journey. No sign of the woman herself.\n","page 59":"So close. So damn close. She wasn’t accustomed to such prolonged travel. That’s not to say she didn’t enjoy it. Hell, it was like something written in a novel. A book of magic, handsome companion—in his own right—and weeks spent on the road. Being the daughter of a poor family not doing much better on her own, it provided a certain…opportunity. She’d survived so far by being open to such opportunity and taking advantage when it presented itself. This journey was no different.\n\nHer beauty always drew others to her. She knew it. They knew it. It was no different when that rogue made his interests known. Richter. Such a sweet man, once you got past his care-free exterior, that is. No, Katia was surprised she let it get as far as it did. Then again, the rogue wasn’t the only one who’d fallen in love with her. There had been many over the years. Did she love him back? Perhaps. Maybe she just thought she did. It’s hard for a young mind to know for certain, especially when experience is absent.\n\nHe returned from a long journey tracking a rebellious organization. Secretly, Katia knew the real objective of the mission: finding the cube. At the time, she didn’t know what it was. A treasure to give them both a new start. Damn, that sounded good to a poor tavern waitress who’d lived in poverty her entire life. If only she didn’t cast her lot in with the rogue. Men of his type couldn’t control themselves, despite their true feelings. They seek a new thrill. They head in whichever direction draws their attention, even if that isn’t in their best interest or in the best interest of—whatever Katia was. She should have known. Damn inexperience.\n\nHowever, in the end his feelings were apparent. Left without other options, or short attention span taking him elsewhere, Richter had settled on Katia. It was too late. She’d already seduced his companion to spite him. Katia wondered if he knew. Unfortunate timing, that. Still, she had caught Richter underneath Marta’s skirt. His body was unfaithful. But maybe, just maybe, his heart remained true. His death is recent enough for Katia to believe that. Give it a few months, and she’ll curse him for his action. His type of love was intense, unwavering. But it was directed at whatever—or whoever—was in front of him.\n\nRichter…\n\nKatia truly wished he found peace. His destiny wasn’t to discover the book. Perhaps, hers was.\n","page 9":"As you follow behind the two cloaks, you catch sight, and a whiff, of the stew that was being brought out for you. Unfortunately, you don’t get a chance to partake. On the way out, you toss a few coins to the woman who sat you earlier. Good service is worth paying for.\n\nStill early, the street is still fairly uninhabited. There are a few more people out then on the way to the inn, but nothing like it would be in a few hours. Despite the sun barely rising, the cold temperature is even more of a reason for people to stay in bed. The pace is brisk. Your escorts are in a hurry.\n\nSuddenly, one of the cloaks turns down an alley, the one who seems to speak in questions. As you turn to address the odd behavior to the other, a hard blow hits the back of your head, sending your vision appearing in spots. You’re thrown into the alley after the first man.\n\nWorld spinning, you see the follow up aggression just in time for a fist to land under your chin. The punch sends you sprawling on the ground. Dizzy, and being honest with yourself, a little drunk still, you do your best to defend yourself as the two cloaks take advantage of your prone state, kicking at your body, aiming for vulnerable locations. They pull your weapons from their sheathes and toss them to the side. Only able to protect a small amount, you guard the essentials, leaving a large portion undefended.\n\nSatisfied you’re too damaged to run, they pause for a moment. Down the alleyway, a woman walks past. She notices the three of you, then continues on.\n\n“Where is it?” the questioning cloak questions.\n\nYou give him a taste of his own medicine. “Where is what?”\n\n“The book. Where is the book?”\n\nYou don’t know anything about a book. But it’s better if they assume you do, otherwise your value is quickly diminished along with their reason to keep you alive.\n\n“It’s…safe,” you answer.\n\n“Safe where?”\n\n“In a location,” you lie, “where no one would think to look.”\n\n“Which is…?”\n\n“Well, the temple library of course.”\n\nYour two assailants glance at each other. Who the hell hides a valuable book in the library? Now’s our chance. I agree. This would be a lot easier if you didn’t impair our senses like this. Just making for a level playing ground.\n\nNot fully recovered, though just enough, you kick the heel of your boot forward, doubling one of the cloaks over, grabbing his crotch. That’s how you aim for a vulnerable location. The other advances, meaning to catch you still on the ground. Instead of directly engaging, you roll backward, landing on your feet. The maneuver takes you close to the alley wall. As the second cloak is almost upon you, you kick off the wall with your foot, throwing all of your momentum into the punch. It lands solid, sending a shock of pain into your hand. Senses impaired, you allowed your two smaller knuckles to absorb some of the impact. Hit with the first two knuckles; they’re much less likely to break.\n\nOne down, you focus on the other frayed cloak. He’s a little more tentative now, no longer standing with an ally. False courage, portrayed with a superior number. Power lies with the individual. The collective group is only made strong by the pieces that put it together. Weak links, an unsteady foundation. A man must learn to stand on his own: a lesson that you are currently teaching with each blow. Your fist lands to his gut, setting up an opening for an uppercut. A small grunt escapes his lips just before your punch lands cleanly on his chin, the first two knuckles this time, sending the man to a cozy sleep next to his partner.\n\nStanding over their two bodies, you pick up your bow, sword, and dagger from where the men tossed them. Another woman passes by the alley, sees you arming yourself over two fallen bodies, and continues on. Lord Tiras, the Spirit of Truth, a mysterious book… One thing’s for certain, if someone sent these men after you, your companions from the job likely received a similar visit. You better check on…\n","page 14":"Unfortunately, you know exactly where Richter is staying. He’s renting a room at a tavern, a tavern that employs a certain waitress you weren’t planning on seeing any time soon. The present situation, however, overrides uncomfortable social settings, so you make your way to Herald’s Fire.\n\nIt’s still early, and luckily you don’t see Katia as you enter. One of the waitresses gives you a dirty look. Somehow she’s aware of last night’s (and this morning’s) events. Scorn a woman and you might as well be scorning their friends as well. Mindless fools. Learn to think for yourself. A small staircase lies at the end of the room, which leads to a hallway of rented rooms, four in total. It’s a tavern, after all, not an inn. It’s unusual they offer rooms at all, likely they’ve become the workplace for girls looking to fill their pockets with a few coins.\n\nFinding the door to Richter’s room, you knock. Silence. “Richter?” you speak to the closed door. No answer. You could run downstairs and explain the situation to the owner. Given a man’s life is in danger, you’re sure you could procure a key to the room. But that could take too much time. Besides, your reputation is already low thanks to Katia. How much damage would a little vandalizing do?\n\nYou kick open the door to Richter’s room.\n\nThe heel of your boot smashes into the door, sending splinters flying in the air. Lockpicking was Richter’s job. You’re certain Maxx would approve of your current strategy. Jaina would act unimpressed, like the way she acted for most things.\n\nSurprisingly, the room is in fair condition. It’s a simple thing, a small bed in the center and a desk in the corner. A single candlestick sits on the nightstand, unlit for a while by the looks of it. No sign of Richter or any assailants. Strange. Out of your former companions, you assumed Richter was the one most likely for suspicious behavior. Everything in the room feels too…neat.\n\nYou begin to search the room for clues. It hits you that it’s possible Richter hasn’t been visited yet. Whoever is after you might not know the whereabouts of the rogue. Either that or Richter skipped town already. He does have a disposition to avoid dangerous situations. Starting with the bed, you feel for hidden objects underneath the covers and frame. Nothing. Then, you transition to the desk. Nothing. As you turn to leave, a small scratching noise appears behind you.\n\nErrchh!\n\nIt came from the back wall. Moving quieter now, you creep forward, drawing your dagger. You keep on the balls of your feet in order to limit surface area, reducing the chance of a floorboard creaking. Nearing the sound’s origin, you notice a slight difference between one of the wood panels lining the wall. It looks looser than the others, as if it wasn’t nailed correctly. You slide the point of your dagger between the panel and the wall, leveraging it open. It swings open easily, revealing a compartment with a ladder inside. The space is only large enough to climb up, and looking up doesn’t afford any view to what lies on top. After listening for movement, confident that the chances you’re climbing up to a trap are low, you take the ladder.\n\nRope, blood, Richter.\n\nHis arms are tied to a post behind him in a T shape, like a crucifixion without nails. His torso is stripped, bearing several open wounds still running down, pooling beneath him. It’s a wonder it hasn’t dripped into the room below. Richter’s eyes are closed, his head hanging limply to one side.\n\nThwunk!\n\nAn arrow lands behind you, mere inches away from your head. The shaft vibrates slightly with its sudden impact. A figure emerges behind Richter, nocking another arrow, wearing a similar cloak to your assailants. The chances were low, not nonexistent.\n\nAbandoning subterfuge, you swing your body fully into the attic and sprint towards the man. Chances are he’ll aim for your body. Close quarters. Sudden combat. He’ll be aiming for whatever hits. There’s no realistic way you’re able to react to an arrow after it’s fired, so you preemptively change your route, timing it before the man’s able to adjust. As his bowstring is drawn back completely, you shift into a figure-four slide, making your body as flat to the ground as possible.\n\nThwunk!\n\nAnother hit lands on the far wall, the arrow flying harmlessly over your sliding body. You finish your slide with an upswing with your dagger, tearing into the inside leg of the man. He grunts, doubling over, just in time for you to land on your feet. One hand grabs his throat, the other forcefully plants your dagger against his spine.\n\n“Speak,” you direct, putting more pressure on the dagger for emphasis.\n\nOddly, the man breaks into a smile, his unshaven face marked with lines. He’s not a young man. “You have no idea what you’ve got yourself into.”\n\n“No. That’s where you come in. The book. What is the book?”\n\n“You’re better off just giving it to my employer,” the man laughs.\n\n“Why do you seek it?”\n\n“Heh, that’s not for me to disclose. Best of luck on your…endeavor.” The man rams his body backward, impaling himself on your dagger. Quickly, you try to limit the damage, but it’s too late. The man collapses to the ground at the feet of Richter. The wound is too serious for your limited field medicine knowledge. He bleeds out in front of you, information to aid your effort leaves with his life.\n","page 17":"Your heavily-armored companion didn’t rent a room like the others. Rather, he stayed with a family.

Your friend is close to discovering it.”\n\nKatia. So she’s alive. “Where is she?” you ask.\n\nThe corpse gazes into the air. His eyes, dark orbs, roll back in their sockets. “Mmm. She’s in the lower levels. Those in her force, some lost to the cavern. Soon they will join this place in dying life.”\n\nHer force? One thing at a time. The book is on the lower levels. Instead, you traveled to the very top of the keep. Still, there is much to learn in the present situation. The object of your journey may lie below, but that does not mean there is not anything to be gained by coming here first.\n\n“Who are you? Tell me what you know of the book,” you reply, noticing a detail previously missed. The corpse’s wrists are bound in chains, the same for his ankles. Once a king, bound to his throne, now a prisoner to the crown.\n\nChoking laughter. “A man who thought too highly of himself. However great you think you are, you’re nothing. You have no impact on the world. It continues long after you’re gone.”\n\n“You don’t appear gone quite yet.”\n\n“A worse fate. The living knowledge that my life held no meaning. You ask who I am. I will tell you…”\n\n---\n\nNations conquered, empire expanded, wealth overflowing. The world, his. At a young age, he knew greatness was his. History books would be filled with his name, of his many accomplishments. He was born to make an impact. He was raised to take all that he desired. And take, he did.\n\nThe first-born of the king, all looked to him as their future. Thick hair grown long accompanied his princely face, symmetrical, his features sharp. The burden of the crown was something he yearned for, youthful vigor desperate for the challenge of strength. His father accomplished much; he would overshadow the man’s memory with his own.\n\nHis wife was chosen for him, an innocent mage, daughter of a former rival. Such is the nature of his position. Marriage, a strategic tactic meant to benefit the kingdom more than his bedchamber, not that it was filled only with their vows. Other women frequented it, addendums to the life contract. Still, despite the needs of his flesh, he loved her, and she loved him.\n\nNations conquered, it wasn’t enough. Empire expanded, stagnation occurred. Wealth overflowing, there was more to be found. Life is fleeting. All his work, for what? In mere years, he would be old and crippled. His life’s work, unable to join him in the afterlife. What good is building an empire when one can’t enjoy the fruits of his labor? The book, a tome of dark magic. Its power would bring him immortality.\n\nIf only he knew what that meant.\n\nIts location was discovered after decades of research. The top scholars and spellcasters of the world at his disposal. His men were sent to scour the earth, given all authority to question, dispose, and interrogate those who stood in his way. Neighbor spied on neighbor in exchange for wealth. Houses were raided in the night. No citizen was safe from his search. Soon, they banded together, a revolution against his immortal rule. Vermin. He would exterminate those who stood against him. They found the cube, a map hidden within.\n\nIt was protected by holy men, militant and zealous towards their god. A keep nested in-between twin volcanoes, their place of worship. His father left them alone. What danger did a secluded monastery bring, even if it was highly fortified. Little did he know its fortification was meant to guard against what lied within, rather than outside invaders.\n\nThe holy men fought well. Their faith brought more than zealous ideology. Holy magic infused the monks, giving them strength far surpassing the common man. Their prayers smote thousands. Heavy casualties were suffered by his armies. In the end, they fell to his overwhelming forces, the conqueror himself leading the final victorious battle. Deep within the stronghold, he found the book. The tome of dark magic was his. Immortality was in its pages, a lasting empire never to be toppled.\n\nBetrayal.\n\nAnother sought the book, and the promises it contained. Blinded by his pursuit, he didn’t notice the knife at his back until it was too late. His wife, the innocent mage, enacted her revenge. A dormant hatred, silent, building over decades, made itself known. When all was within his grasp, she tore it from his fingers. His efforts, his life’s mission, now hers.\n\nPassion overtook her actions. She could not be reasoned with. Her final words were an incoherent string of words, her mouth unable to keep up with the suppressed emotion. Dark magic within the book took hold, a curse from ancient times. It whispers to the mind, promising to fulfill one’s deepest, darkest desire. Its manifestation is never as imagined, a lesson his precious wife learned, one shared by her husband as well.\n\nAn immortal rule was his, freedom from tyranny was hers.\n\n---\n\n“And so you’re chained here, meant to serve an eternity on the throne,” you say, your voice matching the whisper-like volume of the corpse.\n\n“Bound to an immortal rule,” the corpse answers. “My greatest desire became the thing preventing my rest.”\n\n“I don’t seek fortune or fame,” you speak. “My wish isn’t to hoard great amounts of power to myself.”\n\n“Mmm. Perhaps you’ve come to the wrong place then.”\n\n“Perhaps…”\n\n“But you can end my suffering. Kill me. Set me free.”\n","page 53":"You decide to leave him be. The power that unnaturally prolongs his life is bound to the corpse, chaining him to an eternal service. It’s a power you’d rather not mix yourself with. The corpse chose his fate, aligning himself to old magic. Looking at the result in front of you, that’s not something you’re interested in. The book is in the lower levels. Katia and her “force” are close. You’ve learned what you can here. Best to get a move on.\n\nYou sheathe your bow and place the arrow back in your quiver.\n\n“Fool,” the immortal king whispers. “Such power should not be ignored.”\n\n“Perhaps it should have,” you answer back, turning to leave.\n\n“…have you no mercy?”\n\n“It’s not cruelty that stays my hand. But foresight. Your ambitions blinded you. I’ll not make the same mistake and wind up shackled to that throne.”\n\nHis voice, more strained than before, asks, “Then what is it that drives you, mortal?”\n\nYou pause a moment to think. Is that a question that can be answered in passing?\n\n“I seek closure, freedom, redemption. From myself. From others. Plain and simple. I want my actions to truly be my own. Not lust. Not vengeance. Not even pleasure. You wanted to rule others. I simply want to rule myself and be shackled by my past.”\n\nWith that, you exit the throne room, a choking attempt at laughter is the only response from the shackled king. Whatever power manifested the screech before is used up. Speaking was a strain. Nothing conflicts your departure.\n\nTo the lower levels. What force could be with Katia? She lives. Yes, but who accompanies her? Back down the staircase you travel, quicker this time with knowledge that no threat is near, at least until you reach the ground floor, which causes you to revert back to subterfuge.\n\nThe staircase continues down, winding in a spiral. Your bow is back in your hand. After a few minutes, light appears from the bottom. It doesn’t come from torchlight or brazier; the glow is too consistent for such sources. It’s unwavering like steady sunlight, only you’re deep underground at this point. Its reddish-orange color can mean only one thing. Devil’s Altar. Twin volcanoes. Deep underneath the keep lies pools of magma, somehow a fitting place for a book of dark magic. True to the location’s name as well.\n\nYou’re not only met with magma pools. Voices carry up the staircase as well. You stop less than ten steps from the bottom, still hidden from sight. Looking straight down, though your vision is unable to see inside, you can tell the stone steps lead to rocky footing, a cavern. One small pool of magma sits near the entrance, likely many more further in. You wait a moment, just out of view, listening for signs of movement inside. Your efforts are rewarded.\n\nShuffling of boots. More voices. They appear faintly, a great distance into the cavern. Silently hoping that it’s enough distance not to notice your presence, you sneak down to the bottom of the stairs, staying near the wall. Sure enough, the stairs lead to a large cavern.\n\nPillars of rock protrude from both the floor and ceiling, like water drops frozen in their descent. Several sizable pools of magma are spread out on the floor, arranged like a molten swamp, the rock pillars acting as unkempt grass. A far distance off, a group of soldiers stand in a semi-circle around a woman. Soldiers with Katia? They wear light chainmail displaying no colors. The entire group is transfixed on a single object before them. A stone pedestal with a book on top. It’s too far away to see details other than its black cover. There’s no mistaking this is the one you seek, the one they hunt you for, the one you hunt for.\n\nUnder the cover of several pillars, you continue to creep forward, moving into a favorable position to strike, or at least observe which sort of traps may await you. Whoever the soldiers are, they’ll do you a favor by springing any along the way. You reach a point where you can just make out their words.\n\n“So this is it,” a soldier’s voice speaks. “Lord Tiras thanks you for your service.”\n\n“Grab it so we can move on. Your lord has a large amount of coin waiting for me,” the woman answers.\n\nLord Tiras. We weren’t followed. I made sure of it. Apparently we were. Observe a moment more. Perhaps there is something to be learned.\n\nNodding the soldier steps forward, his chain clinking softly. Two gloved hands reach out for the book. From your new position, you can see it more clearly. It’s not as thick as you imagined. It could probably fit in the inside pocket of your coat. It’s cover is a midnight black. No words. No images. Simplistic.\n\nAs the soldier’s hands grasp the book, his body suddenly tenses, paralyzed. He stands there, hands on the book, arms starting to shake uncontrollably. Suddenly, movement is granted. He vomits on the cavern floor, sending the others near him a few feet back in reaction. The soldier collapses, stomach convulsing, into his own bile. The book falls from his grasp, thankfully not landing in the mess, although it’s been hit by a few drops.\n\nA hand places itself around your mouth. Startled, you turn meaning to fire your bow, but the arrow is pulled from your bowstring by the culprit’s other hand. Katia. She drops the arrow, and holds a finger up to her lips, signaling you to stay quiet. Her hand leaves your mouth. If Katia’s here, then who is…\n\nJaina. The mage removes her hood, squatting down to examine the fallen soldier. So she is working with Lord Tiras. She followed you here meaning to take the book. Lord Tiras, Richter, now Jaina. Who’s next? Your eyes span back to Katia next to you. Her blonde hair isn’t as neatly tied back as before. Wherever she disappeared to, she doesn’t look to have sustained any injuries. Distrust floods your mind. You certainly took great care not to be followed. Perhaps your traveling companion brought others with her.\n","page 52":"Nodding, you take a step back. Arrow still nocked, you raise your bow into position, drawing the string, the arrow’s feather lightly kissing your cheek. Dead eyes meet yours. You release the arrow. The impact snaps the corpse’s head back with a sickening crack, your arrow pinning his head against the throne behind him.\n\nDeep rumbling echoes softly beneath you, originating from lower levels of the keep. Wisps of dark magic shoot into the air, coming from the corpse’s chest, his back bending unnaturally forward, while still being pinned to the throne. Black violet rays pour out, twisting, flying through the air like ribbons in the wind.\n\nThe rumbling continues, growing louder, the very ground beneath you starting to shake. He was bound to this place. Could the place also be bound to him? Seems that way. The floor moves in a sizable quake, like being on a ship’s deck during a storm. Another threatens to knock you from your feet.\n\nThe dark magic pools in the air, hanging heavy like a dark rain cloud. The screech you heard upon skewering the rat appears, piercing your ears, but this time you remain standing. You need to keep moving if you’re going to escape. The keep itself is about to collapse, the very structure itself enslaved to the corpse’s rule.\n\nWhatever is happening in the lower levels is making its way up. Katia and “her force” are likely buried by now, the book along with them. With your current rations, there’s no way you can spend weeks digging through the rubble. If anything, you’ll need to mount an expeditionary team to help, which would take many weeks. That’s a problem for another time. Now, you need to survive the collapsing keep.\n\nThe room, filled with dark magic, is growing increasingly unstable. Blood pours from your ears. You sheathe your bow and rip of pieces of cloth from your tunic, stuffing them inside of your ears. The opponent you face isn’t to be killed by arrows. Your opponent is crumbling in on itself and wants to bury you along with it.\n\nRun. Reach out. We need to escape. There’s another solution. Leave this place. Reach out.Leave while you can. The power here, it can be ours. It’s a prison. It’s a tomb.\n","page 22":"If there’s a man who can help, it’s Lord Tiras, the most powerful man in the region. Surely with his resources, he’ll be able to keep you safe as well as offer additional information on the book. With the amount of scholars and magicians in his employ, someone’s bound to know something.\n\nYou leave the way you came, offering a final farewell to Richter. Luckily, it’s still early in the day and Herald’s Fire isn’t populated. Even more fortunate is that Katia isn’t there yet. You had placed the panel back on the wall, hiding the secret ladder. It’s best if those after you don’t know you disrupted the interrogation. That should buy you a little time at least. Once the man you killed doesn’t show, they’ll find out. Then you’ll give Richter a proper burial.\n\nLord Tiras’ men recognize you, allowing you entry into the keep. However, like before, you’re still made to wait outside the lord’s study for more than a short amount of time. Six pairs of eyes watch you, daring you to misstep. Bored with guard duty, you imagine they’re itching to jump to the “aid of their lord.” Jensen, Lord Tiras’ man, appears and commands your weapons be left behind. Once stripped, you follow him into Lord Tiras’ study.\n\nYou’re greeted with a familiar sight of books and steps leading down to a sizable desk. Surprisingly, Lord Tiras isn’t alone. A woman stands next to him, her coat lined with fur at the edges. Jaina.\n\n“Didn’t expect to find you here,” you comment.\n\nShe laughs in a manner that seems to say I didn’t expect you to expect me. “Oh come now. You can’t be that thick-headed. Do you really think peaceful Silvaras was the main focus?”\n\n“That’s enough, Jaina,” Lord Tiras interjects, moving his hand with the command. A gesture that has become all too familiar with the man. “You’ve served me well recently. I’m not about to throw away your usefulness just because you think in a singular manner.”\n\n“With respect, lord, you hired me to put an end to the Spirit of Truth. And that’s what I did,” you answer.\n\n“Yes, I suppose that’s true,” Lord Tiras muses, taking his hand to his chin in thought. “Then how is it that each member of your group, besides yourself, of course, traveled with the book in mind?”\n\nJaina’s involvement is apparent now. Richter’s, obviously. But Maxx? The big fellow was concerned more with comradery than riches. You voice the thought. “All except Maxx, you mean.”\n\nLord Tiras raises an eyebrow. “So you’ve spoken to the rogue then?”\n","page 66":"“It was never about the book,” you say. “The things I seek won’t be fixed with a simple wish or curse or whatever the hell is inside that tome.”\n\nKatia smiles. It strikes you as the first true smile you’ve witnessed from the woman rather than the facade she put on before. Dangerous woman, this one. “I had a feeling you might say that. I’m a student of character, among other things. How do you think I seduced you so easily?” That question is easily answered by having her look in a mirror. She flips the daggers again. “You’ve never been one for riches or women…however, you do enjoy a good drink, so you’re not completely without sin.”\n\n“You’ll receive no argument from me in that regard.”\n\n“Pessimism,” Katia begins. “Is your other mistress. She goes hand in hand with the drink. At least there isn’t in-fighting between the two.”\n\n“This is it then,” the words pour from your mouth. This time, they are yours. Not like when you spoke them to her. Memories. A blanket spread on the bluffs, overlooking the sea. Her warm body next to yours. Waking up to an empty vodka bottle. No hand to interlock with yours; it, instead, holds a hunter’s weapon.\n\nThe path is set, and there’s no going back. For the sake of closure. It never comes as expected. There’s not some sudden rush of feeling like that of a parent tucking you into bed. Life still moves on, with or without you.\n\n“This is it then,” Katia returns your words back to you. “Where will you go?”\n\nYou really have no idea. There are no ties holding you to a particular city. No employer. No lover. Some may consider that freedom. You could pack up at a moment’s time and leave on nothing but a simple impulse. But still, there’s something severely lacking: a sense of purpose. Some may thrive living without a sense of responsibility. Journeying to Devil’s Altar was a quick fix, a ripped tunic acting as a tourniquet. Not a long-term solution. The book could be a long-term solution… You shake that thought from your mind. The path’s already been chosen.\n\n“Do yourself a favor,” Katia speaks again. “Learn to live outside that head of yours. There’s a certain tenacity to you, a willpower guiding your actions for better or for worse. When your mind’s made up, you press on ignoring everything else, tunneling on the objective.”\n\n“That doesn’t sound like a particularly negative thing,” you comment.\n\n“No—but not every decision needs a hefty internal debate. Sometimes you just gotta pick the path and move on. Simple as that.”\n\nKatia stuffs the tome inside of her inner coat pocket. She flashes you a smile a final time before heading for the staircase. Before picking up your bow, you sift through the bodies on the floor. Wherever you’re headed, you’ll need supplies. Besides, it doesn’t look like the soldiers—or Jaina—need their equipment anymore. After taking a few military rations, tasteless but filling, you grab your bow and sling it on your back.\n\nThe world is before us. The possibilities are endless. Where to go? I can think of a good place to start. Back to where it all began, to the one who put this into motion. A certain lord hired you to hunt a peaceful man with ulterior motives. You’re tired of being used. You’re tired of being other people’s playthings. Betrayal: the siren song of your life. It’s time to sing it for another.\n","page 21":"You may have been too late to save the rogue, but at least you can see to his body. You weren’t close. He simply was a set of skills needed for the task. Still, weeks of traveling with one another, it makes you see them in a different light. Experience is the tightest bond there is. He doesn’t deserve to die like this. Pulling your dagger, you start to cut the rope holding Richter to the post. As the first few strands are cut, Richter suddenly gurgles, coming awake from a sleep you thought eternal. A few drops land on your overcoat.\n\n“…came back for me, huh?” Richter’s voice is but a haggard whisper.\n\nYou reply, keeping a similar volume as not to overwhelm the man. “Someone’s after us. All of us. They seek—”\n\n“—I know,” Richter cuts you off. “A book. Tell me, do you know which one?”\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n“Heh… (cough)” You finish cutting the rope and slowly guide Richter’s body down, placing his back against the post. He continues. “It contains great power. The selling price is worth more than a few small kingdoms. But that’s not what interests you, is it? No, you never pursued the finer things in life. Funny, now I understand. Tell me, have you ever been in love?”\n\nA blanket spread out on the grass, placed underneath strong pine. Its leaves rustle with the wind, creating phantom spectators watching the two of you. The wind, a cool breeze. The moon, your only light. Her body, warm comfort. Only her outline is visible, a sensual silhouette in the night. Each familiar touch brings images, memories of time spent in the light. It’s the way it should be. Simple. Uncomplicated. Just the two of you. Tomorrow can wait. Tonight it’s just the two of you.\n\nYou shake your head to clear the memory. Richter takes that as your answer. “Shame. Cynicism kept me from finding it earlier. I wish I had more time with her. (Cough). Here at the end, she’s all I can think of. That’s why I’m staying here, the place where she works.”\n\nA sinking feeling begins in your chest. Bringing his focus back, you ask, “And what do you know of the book?”\n\nRichter’s grin appears, bright teeth poking through dried blood. Even now, his apparent deception is something he’s proud of. “More than most. Its location, for one. The promises it keeps, for two. It’s of dark magic, an ancient curse if you believe that sort of thing. The Spirit of Truth held a certain…missing puzzle piece.”\n\n“Which is?”\n\nRichter breaks into another fit of coughing, gurgling. His body convulses, meaning to empty his stomach’s contents. Hacking, Richter shoves two fingers down his throat, triggering his gag reflex. In a waterfall of brown mess, taking away your appetite for stew, vomit pours down the front of Richter’s torso along with a small leather bag, not unlike the one used to transport small jewelry. He motions for you to pick it up.\n\n“That will take you to the book.”\n\n“Why are you telling me?” you ask.\n\n“Isn’t it obvious? You could have skipped town, but instead (cough), you came to rescue me. Take it. Find the book. And promise me…”\n\nYou have a feeling what his next words will be.\n\n“…you’ll take care of Katia.”\n\nYou remain silent as breath escapes Richter for the final time. Your hand reaches for the leather bag, wiping it down with the dead man’s cloak. So, Richter is the cause. Out of the four, he was the most likely to snatch an item of worth. Many questions fill your head. The book’s origin, those who seek it, Richter’s involvement, Katia, the possibility of seeking Lord Tiras for help. Answers are scarce. Weigh the options, then commit. Whether you choose right or wrong, the journey begins by taking a step forward.\n","page 65":"Humility be damned, you’re tired of being walked over. Tired of people taking advantage of you. Sure, you can admit your own shortcomings, but that doesn’t mean you have to let others take what is yours. She chose her path. Katia chose hers. Now, it’s your turn.\n\nBefore Katia can react, maybe she was thinking you would submit, you dive towards your bow, scooping it up, completing a roll, and drawing upon completion. You aim the weapon at Katia.\n\n“And so our paths are chosen,” you say. “I’m sorry it came to this.”\n\n“Sorry?” Katia questions. “You were always different in your own right, but I never pegged you a fool. You’ve chosen death.”\n\n“We’ll see about that,” you answer, firing the arrow. It travels directly for Katia. At the last second, her body fades from existence, the arrow lodging itself harmlessly into a rocky pillar.\n\nThe sight of her appearing behind Jaina blinks into your mind. Chances are, she’ll try the same with you. You dive to your left, firing another arrow in the place where you once stood. Your intuition is correct. Her body appears just in time for the arrow to land squarely in her chest. The impact knocks Katia back a few feet to the ground. Her daggers fly from her hands, clanking on the cavern floor, far from her reach. She coughs as you approach, the pain from the action visible on her face.\n\n“I’ve chosen death, yes. Though not my own,” you say, staring down at your former traveling companion.\n\nKatia coughs again. The tips of her blonde hair are starting to be dyed red from her chest wound. “And here I thought I had you all figured out.”\n\nAfter making sure she has no more daggers hidden on her, you bend down near Katia. “That wound is fatal. Removing my arrow would cause more damage.”\n\n“Always with your mind on the immediate,” Katia manages to say. She coughs again, a heavy wheeze. Her lung must be punctured. Blood is pooling inside. She has little time left.\n\nYou nod towards the wound. “Would you have me thinking elsewhere?”\n\n“Fair enough,” she answers. “So, no one else stands in your way. The book is yours. What will you do with it?”\n\nShe asks the question that you’ve been pouring over the entire journey here. What started out as a search for closure, a hope that redemption still exists for you, is finally drawing to an end. And the fact is, you still haven’t been able to answer that question. You’ve never been one to live a lavish lifestyle. Gold coins were simply to buy new gear and to keep living. It’s not like you have a house. The price of inn rooms add up after a while, that is when you’re not out in the wilderness.\n\nThere’s really only one option to take. Richter said the tome is of dark magic, ancient curses. But it also holds great power within. Perhaps it holds the power to free you from your past and the nightmares that haunt your dreams. There lies a danger, however. The corpse you found tied to the throne formerly possessed the book. His story is a warning. What you think you seek isn’t what will be awarded to you.\n\nYour eyes draw to the book. It sits comfortably within Katia’s inner coat still. She notices your glance and speaks again. “Just take it. It won’t do me any good now.”\n\nYou reach out and take the book from her. As before, it’s length is surprising. Since learning of the tome, you pictured a thick volume with ancient symbols inscribed on the cover. In reality, it’s rather…plain. No symbols on the front or back. It’s bound with leather, dyed black, like a tree trunk after suffering a fire.\n\n“This is it?” you wonder aloud. You’re not met with a response. You glance back down to Katia. She lies silent, her eyes staring aimlessly forward. Her chest is absent from its normal cadence of breath. You reach out and gently shut her eyelids.\n\nNext you flip open the book.\n\nIts pages are nothing but ancient glyphs, foreign text that bears no meaning. Unable to decipher the words, you keep turning pages searching for some familiarity. A book of power betrays its namesake if the words are unable to be read, and you sure as hell don’t want to hire an interpreter—that’d be as good as giving the artifact away. No, you need to find something usable.\n\nWhile the tome itself isn’t extensive, the pages themselves are. Thick paper makes up each page, parchment from a time when paper wasn’t made as sleek. They have a weight to them, a quality of the highest standard. As you continue to flip, the glyphs blur together. What once was rows upon rows of text, steadily becomes a single mass of black ink, swirling together. At once, the swirl puffs into the air, as if the tome were the mouth of a volcano. The cloud hangs in the air a moment before extinguishing completely. Your vision fades as well.\n\n---\n\nDarkness. All around you is black, more so than the most starless of nights. It’s like being underground with a blindfold tied around your eyes. Then, light. It starts small, just a small glow in the distance. It’s luminosity is as if it were a firefly, though significantly larger. It draws near, seeming to move with intention. Intentionally heading for you.\n\nIt hovers just above your body, waiting as if it wants some sort of reaction from you. Then it takes off in the distance. Not knowing what else to do, you break into a sprint after it. As you move, you notice your weapons and armor are gone. Instead, you’re dressed in a flowing black robe, like that of a priest. Air doesn’t rush by. You don’t feel the strength of your arms pumping, the impact of your feet upon the ground. It’s like you’re running underwater, limbs moving frantically but going nowhere. After keeping pace for almost a minute, you realize you’re not even breathing heavy. Wherever you are, normal physics has no place here.\n\nThe light stops. So do you.\n\nThe darkness gives way, retreating just to the edge of your vision, allowing you to see your surroundings. You find yourself in what appears to be a throne room, although not one for ceremonies. No, it looks as if a place of judgement, where one does not happily attend a summoning. And yet, you are summoned.\n\nA voice rings out, fading in and out of existence, attempting to twist your sanity along with it.\n\nHaunted by his past he comes. He thinks he can rewrite history. Ha ha ha. Many have tried, none have succeeded.\n\n“Who speaks?” you shout into the darkness. “I seek nothing but the mending of old wounds.”\n\nMmm. Interesting. Not power? Not wealth? Men are often such base things. Old wounds you say… The voice croaks, old and throaty.\n\n…and why would you be after such a thing?\n","page 24":"Deep in the mountains, nested between a pair of volcanoes, there lies a keep. It’s build is simple, ordinary even. Surrounded by white-capped tips, the twin volcanoes are a stain upon the land, their blackened rock ruining the purity of the range. They sit dormant for now, biding their time until ready to spit fire upon the land.\n\nTheir existence is no secret. After all, they stick out like a pair of burnt logs in a pile of fresh firewood. Still, men keep their distance. And for good reason. Devil’s Altar, a place of evil, a place of the damned. Even more so for what lies within.\n\nA king of ancient times rules. It’s his destiny to rule for eternity, his birthright. It’s what he’s fought for. It’s what he’s slaughtered for. Heavy lies the crown, but the weight is comforting. It speaks to a man’s struggle and prevail. Nothing of worth is easily won, and his victory had no small cost of other men’s lives.\n\nA king of ancient times is bound to the throne. Those who desire power are often surprised by the shackles it brings. Freedom does not accompany status. In order to rise to power, the task must rise above all else. Nothing can stand against the goal. Those in pursuit are bound to a single path, else they fail to achieve, even more so once power is actually obtained. Then, the burden lies with maintaining it. Men will seek to take it. Thieves. Outlaws. They must be put down.\n\nA king of ancient times lies in the space between death and life. Not fully alive, and yet not completely in death. He simply exists, but not without the agony of loneliness. His survival is longer than that of his subjects, unable to join him in his state. Family, friends, subjects: all dead, but still, the king remains. The throne is his, and he cannot join them, even though he wishes.\n\nMost men seek to avoid death. The immortal king longs for it.\n","page 68":"Humility be damned, you’re tired of being walked over. Tired of people taking advantage of you. Sure, you can admit your own shortcomings, but that doesn’t mean you have to let others take what is yours. She chose her path. Katia chose hers. Now, it’s your turn.\n\nBefore Katia can react, maybe she was thinking you would submit, you dive towards your bow, scooping it up, completing a roll, and drawing upon completion. You aim the weapon at Katia.\n\n“And so our paths are chosen,” you say. “I’m sorry it came to this.”\n\n“Sorry?” Katia questions. “You were always different in your own right, but I never pegged you a fool. You’ve chosen death.”\n\n“We’ll see about that,” you answer, firing the arrow. It travels directly for Katia. At the last second, her body fades from existence, the arrow lodging itself harmlessly into a rocky pillar.\n\nThe sight of her appearing behind Jaina blinks into your mind. Chances are, she’ll try the same with you. You dive to your left, firing another arrow in the place where you once stood. Your intuition is correct. Her body appears just in time for the arrow to land squarely in her chest. The impact knocks Katia back a few feet to the ground. Her daggers fly from her hands, clanking on the cavern floor, far from her reach. She coughs as you approach, the pain from the action visible on her face.\n\n“I’ve chosen death, yes. Though not my own,” you say, staring down at your former traveling companion.\n\nKatia coughs again. The tips of her blonde hair are starting to be dyed red from her chest wound. “And here I thought I had you all figured out.”\n\nAfter making sure she has no more daggers hidden on her, you bend down near Katia. “That wound is fatal. Removing my arrow would cause more damage.”\n\n“Always with your mind on the immediate,” Katia manages to say. She coughs again, a heavy wheeze. Her lung must be punctured. Blood is pooling inside. She has little time left.\n\nYou nod towards the wound. “Would you have me thinking elsewhere?”\n\n“Fair enough,” she answers. “So, no one else stands in your way. The book is yours. What will you do with it?”\n\nShe asks the question that you’ve been pouring over the entire journey here. What started out as a search for closure, a hope that redemption still exists for you, is finally drawing to an end. And the fact is, you still haven’t been able to answer that question. You’ve never been one to live a lavish lifestyle. Gold coins were simply to buy new gear and to keep living. It’s not like you have a house. The price of inn rooms add up after a while, that is when you’re not out in the wilderness.\n\nThere’s really only one option to take. Richter said the tome is of dark magic, ancient curses. But it also holds great power within. Perhaps it holds the power to free you from your past and the nightmares that haunt your dreams. There lies a danger, however. The corpse you found tied to the throne formerly possessed the book. His story is a warning. What you think you seek isn’t what will be awarded to you.\n\nYour eyes draw to the book. It sits comfortably within Katia’s inner coat still. She notices your glance and speaks again. “Just take it. It won’t do me any good now.”\n\nYou reach out and take the book from her. As before, it’s length is surprising. Since learning of the tome, you pictured a thick volume with ancient symbols inscribed on the cover. In reality, it’s rather…plain. No symbols on the front or back. It’s bound with leather, dyed black, like a tree trunk after suffering a fire.\n\n“This is it?” you wonder aloud. You’re not met with a response. You glance back down to Katia. She lies silent, her eyes staring aimlessly forward. Her chest is absent from its normal cadence of breath. You reach out and gently shut her eyelids.\n\nNext you flip open the book.\n\nIts pages are nothing but ancient glyphs, foreign text that bears no meaning. Unable to decipher the words, you keep turning pages searching for some familiarity. A book of power betrays its namesake if the words are unable to be read, and you sure as hell don’t want to hire an interpreter—that’d be as good as giving the artifact away. No, you need to find something usable.\n\nWhile the tome itself isn’t extensive, the pages themselves are. Thick paper makes up each page, parchment from a time when paper wasn’t made as sleek. They have a weight to them, a quality of the highest standard. As you continue to flip, the glyphs blur together. What once was rows upon rows of text, steadily becomes a single mass of black ink, swirling together. At once, the swirl puffs into the air, as if the tome were the mouth of a volcano. The cloud hangs in the air a moment before extinguishing completely. Your vision fades as well.\n\n---\n\nDarkness. All around you is black, more so than the most starless of nights. It’s like being underground with a blindfold tied around your eyes. Then, light. It starts small, just a small glow in the distance. It’s luminosity is as if it were a firefly, though significantly larger. It draws near, seeming to move with intention. Intentionally heading for you.\n\nIt hovers just above your body, waiting as if it wants some sort of reaction from you. Then it takes off in the distance. Not knowing what else to do, you break into a sprint after it. As you move, you notice your weapons and armor are gone. Instead, you’re dressed in a flowing black robe, like that of a priest. Air doesn’t rush by. You don’t feel the strength of your arms pumping, the impact of your feet upon the ground. It’s like you’re running underwater, limbs moving frantically but going nowhere. After keeping pace for almost a minute, you realize you’re not even breathing heavy. Wherever you are, normal physics has no place here.\n\nThe light stops. So do you.\n\nThe darkness gives way, retreating just to the edge of your vision, allowing you to see your surroundings. You find yourself in what appears to be a throne room, although not one for ceremonies. No, it looks as if a place of judgement, where one does not happily attend a summoning. And yet, you are summoned.\n\nA voice rings out, fading in and out of existence, attempting to twist your sanity along with it.\n\nHaunted by his past he comes. He thinks he can rewrite history. Ha ha ha. Many have tried, none have succeeded.\n\n“Who speaks?” you shout into the darkness. “I seek nothing but the mending of old wounds.”\n\nMmm. Interesting. Not power? Not wealth? Men are often such base things. Old wounds you say… The voice croaks, old and throaty.\n\n…and why would you be after such a thing?\n","page 23":"Whatever your decision turns out to be, you’ll need to know what the pouch holds. Again, wiping it off, you pull the strings at the top and pour its contents onto the floor. It’s a small mechanical cube, like the wooden block of a child, but with spinning gears and a metallic body. Interesting. As you examine it closer, your finger hits an unseen button. The inner section of the cube grinds in motion. In reaction, you place it on the ground in front of you, kneeling beside it, just in case something sharp, or arcane, shoots out. Instead, something else reveals itself.\n\n“Now, that’s interesting,” you comment to yourself. “Very interesting.”\n\nA three-dimensional map appears, illuminated by a strange device within the cube. It’s point of view is that of a soaring hawk, looking down on the world from far above. Trees are barely visible, little green pins scattered on miniature mountains. The map revolves around a single location, a shining bright light instantly drawing your eyes to it: a fortress deep in the mountains, nested comfortably between two peaks, ones that you are familiar with.\n\nDevil’s Altar, a pair of volcanoes in the Sheol Mountains. Its ridges are black, unlike the snowy mountains that surround. Scholars say it’s due to the internal temperature. Snow is unable to rest on top without melting. Religious figures say it’s the entryway to hell, unsurprisingly. Whatever the case may be, those who approach the twin volcanoes don’t return.\n\n“Is that…” a woman’s voice softly speaks. You turn to find Katia peering her head into the room, her body hidden by the ladder compartment. “…Richter?”\n\nYou jump to your feet, placing yourself between Richter’s body and Katia’s line of sight, conveniently hiding the map as well. “You should not be here. Forget anything you think you may have saw and climb back down.”\n\n“Did you kill him?” Katia asks, bluntly. The girl is straightforward if nothing else. It catches you off-guard.\n\n“What? No. We traveled together. Seems he discovered something that caught the attention of some very dangerous people.”\n\n“If they’re after him…” The girl is smarter than she looks. “Then they’re after you too?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“The chances are high they’re after me too, then.”\n\nSmart, indeed. You hadn’t thought about your associations. There’s no doubt if the cloaks are interrogating the four of you, that will extend to family, friends, and lovers. Words shared between friends are dangerous when brought to light.\n\n“The chances are high, yes,” you answer. “Leave town. Keep your distance from this place, at least until I handle things.”\n\n“You mean until you take it for yourself.”\n\nDoes she know about the book? Everyone seems to know about it. She knows more than she’s letting on. Press, search for answers. You do just that. “What did Richter share with you? I mean only to put an end to those who pursue us.”\n\nKatia eyes you for a moment, searching for a hint of dishonesty. Finally, she says, “Richter said he found a score above the rest, a wealth of treasure to leave this place behind and start a new life with. When he returned we had a…falling out and I wanted to get back at him by…you know…”\n\nSo you are—were—just a pawn in a game of chess between lovers. And you thought events were because of your charisma? Not exactly. Women don’t just throw themselves at us without an ulterior motive. There’s always an ulterior motive. Everyone has an agenda. Even us.\n\nYou think it best to be honest with the woman. She needs to know the severity of the situation. “Listen, the ‘treasure’ is not what you think it is. It’s a tome. An artifact. Sure, it could probably be sold for top coin, but some things shouldn’t reach the surface of men.”\n\n“Why? What’s so dangerous about it?”\n\n“It’s of dark magic,” you answer, recalling the little information Richter shared with his dying breath. “Ancient curses, best kept buried.”\n\n“And you’re planning to find it for yourself? Then what? Destroy it?”\n\nYou’re not exactly sure. You alone hold the location of an artifact someone desperately wants. They’ll keep sending men after you. No, you need to address the problem at the source. Find the artifact. Learn of its power. And perhaps use it to stop whoever’s after you. Instead of a solid plan, you have fragments of ideas. It’ll be a long journey. At least you’ll have time to think. The first step is clear, however. Find the book.\n\n“Fine,” Katia breaks you from your thoughts. “Don’t tell me. But at least let me come with you, for the sake of closure.”\n\n“…for the sake of closure.” The words pour from your mouth as if a dream. Although they are spoken from your lips, somehow they don’t seem quite yours.\n\n“I’ve got to move on,” she whispers back. “There’s a whole world to discover. I can’t waste my life staying in one place.”\n\nIt’s dark now. No longer does the setting sun linger with its orange glow. Its light, its warmth is replaced with cool darkness, a steady transition, unnoticeable until it’s completely changed. You lay at the usual spot. Her blanket spread flat on the bluffs, overlooking the sea, hidden from the beach with small plants and trees. Private. Secluded. Yours.\n\n“This is a waste then?” you whisper, instantly regretting the loaded question.\n\n“I…I don’t know. Maybe.”\n\n“What you seek to avoid being here. It will follow you to the next destination.”\n\n“Mm. Perhaps. But I have to try. I don’t want to look back and wonder what could have been.”\n\nWishful thinking. A result of her immaturity. Life isn’t some grand adventure. No, it’s not. It’s a daily struggle to stay afloat. Nothing with worth is built without sacrifice. It takes time. It takes sacrifice. Let her leave. We don’t need her.\n\n“This is it then,” you state, the words again appear as someone else’s.\n\nWarm hands comfortingly embrace yours. You feel the familiar softness of her skin, tracing her hand, finding a few rough calluses in contrast to the palm in which they grow. They’re smaller than before. Now that her wounds are healed, they’ll likely return back to their previous size. Warm hands. Then cool metal. She places a small object in your open palm. A ring. The very one you placed on her finger from bended knee.\n\nShe doesn’t respond to your statement. Her action is answer enough. Tender lips meet your cheek. Better had she left you with nothing at all, rather than a fragment of once was. And just like that, as if the sun disappearing under the horizon, its warmth, its glow disappearing, she leaves, darkness, settling in.\n\nNo confrontation. No hate. No closure. Just, emptiness.\n\nYou rise to a seat, crossing your legs, resting your elbows on your knees, staring into the darkness. The movement causes you to bump into an object still laying on the blanket. Vodka. A little medication never hurt. Whatever it takes. Calm the senses. Suppress the thoughts. Numb them. Whatever it takes.\n\n---\n\nMorning light rudely greets your headache. An empty bottle. A new day. The chance to move on. Doing your best to ignore the throbbing at your temple, you sit up and pack your things, first taking a few gulps from your waterskin. It’s not cold. It tastes slightly of the leather pouch. But still, it refreshes, in this moment tasting like water from a fresh mountain spring. Perspective. Need. Desire. Nothing is absolute. You pack your things, leaving the blanket behind. Her blanket. Something you no longer have the need for.\n\nYou pick up your bow. The weight feels powerful in your hand. Harnessed energy at your disposal. Its usefulness is wasted sitting around. It serves a specific purpose. Deadly, pointed in the proper direction. Purpose. Direction. You’ll take those over adventure any day. A new day. The chance to move on. Today you hunt.\n\n---\n\n“…for the sake of closure.”\n\nYou’re brought back to reality. The memory that the statement triggered vanishes. It may be too late for you, but it’s not for Katia.\n\n“You may come,” you answer. “If you do exactly what I say. No questions asked.”\n\nShe doesn’t look happy. The result of getting what she wants isn’t a bright smile or cheerful grin. Rather, you get a solemn nod, a silent agreement to your authority.\n\n“It’s no use returning back to your place. We’ll purchase new equipment on the way out of town,” you say. “I don’t imagine you have any experience with combat?” Katia shakes her head. “No matter. We’ll get you a simple crossbow. Just aim and shoot. Simple is right. The mountains will be cold. Better to pack warm. Horses will take us to the base of the range. From there, we’ll need to hike, so can’t have too much to carry.”\n\nYou realize you’re rambling a bit, thinking out loud. Instead, you take a softer tone, likely a result of the memory that just came to mind.\n\n“It’ll be easier once we leave the city. The open road, the ability to travel wherever you wish: some see it as true freedom. Somehow a change of scenery and viewing the land makes our problems feel smaller. Come now. We’ll be off by midday.”\n\n---\n\nAfter purchasing supplies, mostly rations and warm clothing for Katia, you set off from Lord Tiras’ city. Luckily, you didn’t run into any trouble in the market from the cloaks. You procured a pair of dependable roans from a buck-toothed stablehand who kept twiddling a piece of straw in his mouth.\n\nThe Sheol Mountain range is a few weeks in the distance, across the wind-swept Harken Plains, named after the city lord of a prominent city in the mountain range. However, your destination is far past his city, heading deep into the range rather than a passage through it.\n\nYou travel mostly in silence. The two of you aren’t glossy-eyed lovers, traveling for the sake of adventure and thrills. Each of you seek something. It just so happens that your path connects for now. Assuming the book and whoever’s after you is handled, you’ll likely go your separate ways. For you, that’s nothing new. It usually happens after a job. Your traveling companions are a means to an end, a set of useful skills needed to accomplish a task. Your current situation may be a little different, but the end result will be the same.\n\nThe plains are open. Small grass, mostly brown and dead, occupy the plains. There are no rolling hills filled with lush green, each hilltop bringing wonder to what lies on the opposite side. The ground is flat, dead. The constant wind causes you to pull your hood on a little deeper, both to stop the chill and because it threatens to be blown from your head.\n\nYour mind draws back to your memory. When she left. Is this the “adventure” she wanted? Ugly landscape. Chilling wind. No laughter. No companionship.No cheerful travelers. Just reality. Despite your best attempts to block the memory, it keeps coming back. You shake your head, hoping the physical response will garner some result. It helps, slightly. Suppress it. Focus on the task at hand. One step at a time. Press on. Only the task matters. This one may not be funded by a wealthy lord, but you still plan to navigate through it successfully. The coin provided with the assassination of Silvaras is more than enough to sustain you for a while, even with your current journey being self-funded.\n\nThe sky is gray. Clouds cover the entire sky, giving off a monotone feel to the world. Gray above, dead and brown below. The plains feel exactly what their name would suggest. Several days you’ve been traveling through. It will take several more to reach the other side. Then you’ll reach the Redwood Forest. Just through that will be the Sheol Mountains.\n\nThe flatness provides more than an ample vantage to see if you’re being followed. If the cloaks were after you, you suppose it makes sense for them to trail at a distance. If they could manage, then you would be leading them directly to what they want. That is, if they could stay unseen. You can see for miles, and no one’s appeared. The snowfall will arrive soon as you continue north. Not many travelers are out.\n\nChecking again, you don’t see any sign of others. “This is a good place to stop for the night,” you say. Once there were trees here. A long, long time ago. You’ve stopped at the base of an old stump, which will provide as decent of a wind shield as you’ll get for a small fire. You’re not concerned with fire alerting others to your presence after checking the horizon. Plus, no one can safely travel during the night with the temperature drop.\n\nKatia dismounts and wordlessly throws her pack to the ground. You squat near the base of the trunk and begin starting a fire. The side facing you is darkened from flame already. Seems another has discovered this spot before you, unsurprisingly, as this is best natural shelter gets in the Harken Plains.\n\nSpark, flame, warmth.\n\nSoft glow from the fire springs into existence, giving some color to the previously drab environment. It falters for a movement, almost extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, but then resumes its constant dance, crackling underneath the tree stump.\n\nTimes like these, the world doesn’t feel like the miserable place it mostly appears to be. Perhaps that’s because you’re far from civilization. It’s humbling, braving the elements, knowing it wouldn’t take much for things to take a wrong turn. Perhaps there’s more out there to discover, putting your own problems against the world. Somehow they don’t seem as large.\n","page 67":"They took her from her parents at birth. She never knew the ones who conceived her. That’s all for the best. Distractions must be limited. Besides, parents have a way of imparting ideology on their children. The organization needed a blank slate to mould, to shape into their potential. They called her Katia, although she’s fairly certain that’s not what her parents, in their limited time, would have named her. A new name, a new identity.\n\nNine there were. No more, no less. Each with a matching suit of carapace-like armor, jagged and black. Always in unison, they were, as if they held the ability to hear one another’s thoughts. Nine there were, and Katia aimed to be one of the counted. She deserved it. It was her destiny.\n\nFather believed in her. That’s all that mattered. Father, the leader of the organization, had the utmost faith she would make it into the Nine, his chosen. But still, there were rules. A challenge must be issued, a duel must be set. Only those who proved themselves worthy can issue such a thing. Katia, nothing but an acolyte, needed to prove herself worthy.\n\nThey placed her in Lord Tiras’ city as a sleeper. Lay low, gather information: that was her job. Boring. Unimportant. But Katia was determined to complete the task fully. She wasn’t the only one. They didn’t share details on the others, but she knew the organization had eyes and ears everywhere, extending to listening and watching their own.\n\nThere were worse places to be placed than in a tavern. The patrons were lively enough. After all, Katia could have been directed to pose as a scholar’s ward and spent her waking hours in a library. The tavern, Herald’s Fire, drew a few interesting regulars, including a rogue with a grin permanently stapled to his lips. Richter.\n\nHer body, one of the many tools she possessed, was just right for the job. Slipping the rogue a few free ales helped as well. Drunk, lustful, he shared just the information she was looking for. It wasn’t political in nature. It wouldn’t help the organization’s presence in Lord Tiras’ jurisdiction, at least not directly. But it was exactly what Katia needed for her own ambitions. It was her ticket into the Nine, assuming she gained victory in the duel. Issuing a challenge, difficult. Winning it, even more so.\n\nKatia rested her head on the rogue’s bare chest, feeling the rise and fall with his sleeping breath. It was late. From the rented room in Herald’s Fire, she could barely hear the patrons downstairs stumbling out the door—those who could still walk, that is. Many nights in a row she’d visited Richter in this manner, more than one can count on their fingers.\n\nRichter, he never took anything seriously. The rogue was more about experience, led by his immediate impulse. That made it easy for Katia. Then again, it would be easy for her even if Richter weren’t that way. Such is the natural order of things. Men think they are in control, but they can’t even control their own selves. Instead, they seek to control one another as if domineering another will mend their broken souls. It won’t.\n\nAnd what about Katia? Was she oblivious to an obvious character flaw? If she was, it must not be that significant of a flaw. She’s close. She can feel it. Truthfully, she felt bad for using the rogue. She knows how the journey ends. His death is aligned with her ambition. It’s nothing personal. She deserved it. It was her destiny.\n\n“Can’t sleep, Kat?” Richter whispered. He was the only one to pronounce her name “kat-ee-ah.” She kind of liked it.\n\n“Just thinking,” Katia murmured back. “Thinking how it’ll be lonely when you leave tomorrow.”\n\nRichter, always the romantic, replied, “You’ll be on my mind the entire time. You know I have to do this. And you know what awaits us after.”\n\n“A treasure that surpasses all. One final score to set us up for life.”\n\n“That’s right.” Katia can feel Richter smiling. “We can escape this place. Travel, settle down wherever we want. Live like royalty. No more jobs, no more work. Just pleasure.” For emphasis, Richter’s hands travel underneath the bed sheets, feeling areas of Katia normally kept private.\n\n“Mmm. But you aren’t traveling alone. Can you trust the others in the face of such wealth?”\n\n“No. I have a good read on two of the three. The man who hired me is too thick-headed to ulterior motives, and the other man is of military background. Duty, a false sense of honor will prohibit his actions. He’s more likely to hug me than rob me.” Richter laughs at the last statement. “The woman, however, is different. A sorceress, you know the type, ambition above all else, men merely pawns in her game…”\n\nSounded familiar to Katia.\n\n“…to be used and discarded at will. The treasure will be ours, Kat. We’ll start a new life together, you and I.”\n\n“How long will you be gone?”\n\n“Many weeks. Perhaps months.”\n“Then we better make the most of this time.” Katia’s hands mirror Richter’s, traveling underneath the covers, their work causing sounds of pleasure from the rogue’s lips. While her body may appear to be in the moment, her mind is the furthest thing from it.\n\nWeeks, perhaps months away was her destiny. It was all she lived for. Katia’s contacts revealed what the treasure really was, not gold or gems, but a cube. Inside the cube, a location. At the location, a thing of dark magic, ancient curses. She would take it from the rogue upon return. She would take it from his companions if they turned on him. It was all coming to a close. The thought turns her on, Richter thinking her sudden burst of passion from his own doing. For the first time sharing a bed with the rogue, Katia truly enjoys herself.\n","page 26":"Whatever your decision turns out to be, you’ll need to know what the pouch holds.

Now that her wounds are healed, they’ll likely return back to their previous size. Warm hands. Then cool metal. She places a small object in your open palm. A ring. The very one you placed on her finger from bended knee.\n\nShe doesn’t respond to your statement. Her action is answer enough. Tender lips meet your cheek. Better had she left you with nothing at all, rather than a fragment of once was. And just like that, as if the sun disappearing under the horizon, its warmth, its glow disappearing, she leaves, darkness, settling in.\n\nNo confrontation. No hate. No closure. Just, emptiness.\n\nYou rise to a seat, crossing your legs, resting your elbows on your knees, staring into the darkness. The movement causes you to bump into an object still laying on the blanket. Vodka. A little medication never hurt. Whatever it takes. Calm the senses. Suppress the thoughts. Numb them. Whatever it takes.\n\n---\n\nMorning light rudely greets your headache. An empty bottle. A new day. The chance to move on. Doing your best to ignore the throbbing at your temple, you sit up and pack your things, first taking a few gulps from your waterskin. It’s not cold. It tastes slightly of the leather pouch. But still, it refreshes, in this moment tasting like water from a fresh mountain spring. Perspective. Need. Desire. Nothing is absolute. You pack your things, leaving the blanket behind. Her blanket. Something you no longer have the need for.\n\nYou pick up your bow. The weight feels powerful in your hand. Harnessed energy at your disposal. Its usefulness is wasted sitting around. It serves a specific purpose. Deadly, pointed in the proper direction. Purpose. Direction. You’ll take those over adventure any day. A new day. The chance to move on. Today you hunt.\n\n---\n\n“…for the sake of closure.”\n\nYou’re brought back to reality. The memory that the statement triggered vanishes. It may be too late for you, but it’s not for Katia.\n\n“You may come,” you answer. “If you do exactly what I say. No questions asked.”\n\nShe doesn’t look happy. The result of getting what she wants isn’t a bright smile or cheerful grin. Rather, you get a solemn nod, a silent agreement to your authority.\n\n“It’s no use returning back to your place. We’ll purchase new equipment on the way out of town,” you say. “I don’t imagine you have any experience with combat?” Katia shakes her head. “No matter. We’ll get you a simple crossbow. Just aim and shoot. Simple is right. The mountains will be cold. Better to pack warm. Horses will take us to the base of the range. From there, we’ll need to hike, so can’t have too much to carry.”\n\nYou realize you’re rambling a bit, thinking out loud. Instead, you take a softer tone, likely a result of the memory that just came to mind.\n\n“It’ll be easier once we leave the city. The open road, the ability to travel wherever you wish: some see it as true freedom. Somehow a change of scenery and viewing the land makes our problems feel smaller. Come now. We’ll be off by midday.”\n\n---\n\nAfter purchasing supplies, mostly rations and warm clothing for Katia, you set off from Lord Tiras’ city. Luckily, you didn’t run into any trouble in the market from the cloaks. You procured a pair of dependable roans from a buck-toothed stablehand who kept twiddling a piece of straw in his mouth.\n\nThe Sheol Mountain range is a few weeks in the distance, across the wind-swept Harken Plains, named after the city lord of a prominent city in the mountain range. However, your destination is far past his city, heading deep into the range rather than a passage through it.\n\nYou travel mostly in silence. The two of you aren’t glossy-eyed lovers, traveling for the sake of adventure and thrills. Each of you seek something. It just so happens that your path connects for now. Assuming the book and whoever’s after you is handled, you’ll likely go your separate ways. For you, that’s nothing new. It usually happens after a job. Your traveling companions are a means to an end, a set of useful skills needed to accomplish a task. Your current situation may be a little different, but the end result will be the same.\n\nThe plains are open. Small grass, mostly brown and dead, occupy the plains. There are no rolling hills filled with lush green, each hilltop bringing wonder to what lies on the opposite side. The ground is flat, dead. The constant wind causes you to pull your hood on a little deeper, both to stop the chill and because it threatens to be blown from your head.\n\nYour mind draws back to your memory. When she left. Is this the “adventure” she wanted? Ugly landscape. Chilling wind. No laughter. No companionship.No cheerful travelers. Just reality. Despite your best attempts to block the memory, it keeps coming back. You shake your head, hoping the physical response will garner some result. It helps, slightly. Suppress it. Focus on the task at hand. One step at a time. Press on. Only the task matters. This one may not be funded by a wealthy lord, but you still plan to navigate through it successfully. The coin provided with the assassination of Silvaras is more than enough to sustain you for a while, even with your current journey being self-funded.\n\nThe sky is gray. Clouds cover the entire sky, giving off a monotone feel to the world. Gray above, dead and brown below. The plains feel exactly what their name would suggest. Several days you’ve been traveling through. It will take several more to reach the other side. Then you’ll reach the Redwood Forest. Just through that will be the Sheol Mountains.\n\nThe flatness provides more than an ample vantage to see if you’re being followed. If the cloaks were after you, you suppose it makes sense for them to trail at a distance. If they could manage, then you would be leading them directly to what they want. That is, if they could stay unseen. You can see for miles, and no one’s appeared. The snowfall will arrive soon as you continue north. Not many travelers are out.\n\nChecking again, you don’t see any sign of others. “This is a good place to stop for the night,” you say. Once there were trees here. A long, long time ago. You’ve stopped at the base of an old stump, which will provide as decent of a wind shield as you’ll get for a small fire. You’re not concerned with fire alerting others to your presence after checking the horizon. Plus, no one can safely travel during the night with the temperature drop.\n\nKatia dismounts and wordlessly throws her pack to the ground. You squat near the base of the trunk and begin starting a fire. The side facing you is darkened from flame already. Seems another has discovered this spot before you, unsurprisingly, as this is best natural shelter gets in the Harken Plains.\n\nSpark, flame, warmth.\n\nSoft glow from the fire springs into existence, giving some color to the previously drab environment. It falters for a movement, almost extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, but then resumes its constant dance, crackling underneath the tree stump.\n\nTimes like these, the world doesn’t feel like the miserable place it mostly appears to be. Perhaps that’s because you’re far from civilization. It’s humbling, braving the elements, knowing it wouldn’t take much for things to take a wrong turn. Perhaps there’s more out there to discover, putting your own problems against the world. Somehow they don’t seem as large.\n","page 25":"If there’s a man who can help, it’s Lord Tiras, the most powerful man in the region. Surely with his resources, he’ll be able to keep you safe as well as offer additional information on the book. With the amount of scholars and magicians in his employ, someone’s bound to know something.\n\nYou leave the way you came, offering a final farewell to Richter. Luckily, it’s still early in the day and Herald’s Fire isn’t populated. Even more fortunate is that Katia isn’t there yet. You had placed the panel back on the wall, hiding the secret ladder. It’s best if those after you don’t know you disrupted the interrogation. That should buy you a little time at least. Once the man you killed doesn’t show, they’ll find out. Then you’ll give Richter a proper burial.\n\nLord Tiras’ men recognize you, allowing you entry into the keep. However, like before, you’re still made to wait outside the lord’s study for more than a short amount of time. Six pairs of eyes watch you, daring you to misstep. Bored with guard duty, you imagine they’re itching to jump to the “aid of their lord.” Jensen, Lord Tiras’ man, appears and commands your weapons be left behind. Once stripped, you follow him into Lord Tiras’ study.\n\nYou’re greeted with a familiar sight of books and steps leading down to a sizable desk. Surprisingly, Lord Tiras isn’t alone. A woman stands next to him, her coat lined with fur at the edges. Jaina.\n\n“Didn’t expect to find you here,” you comment.\n\nShe laughs in a manner that seems to say I didn’t expect you to expect me. “Oh come now. You can’t be that thick-headed. Do you really think peaceful Silvaras was the main focus?”\n\n“That’s enough, Jaina,” Lord Tiras interjects, moving his hand with the command. A gesture that has become all too familiar with the man. “You’ve served me well recently. I’m not about to throw away your usefulness just because you think in a singular manner.”\n\n“With respect, lord, you hired me to put an end to the Spirit of Truth. And that’s what I did,” you answer.\n\n“Yes, I suppose that’s true,” Lord Tiras muses, taking his hand to his chin in thought. “Then how is it that each member of your group, besides yourself, of course, traveled with the book in mind?”\n\nJaina’s involvement is apparent now. Richter’s, obviously. But Maxx? The big fellow was concerned more with comradery than riches. You voice the thought. “All except Maxx, you mean.”\n\nLord Tiras raises an eyebrow. “So you’ve spoken to the rogue then?”\n","page 69":"“It was never about the book,” you say. “The things I seek won’t be fixed with a simple wish or curse or whatever the hell is inside that tome.”\n\nKatia smiles. It strikes you as the first true smile you’ve witnessed from the woman rather than the facade she put on before. Dangerous woman, this one. “I had a feeling you might say that. I’m a student of character, among other things. How do you think I seduced you so easily?” That question is easily answered by having her look in a mirror. She flips the daggers again. “You’ve never been one for riches or women…however, you do enjoy a good drink, so you’re not completely without sin.”\n\n“You’ll receive no argument from me in that regard.”\n\n“Pessimism,” Katia begins. “Is your other mistress. She goes hand in hand with the drink. At least there isn’t in-fighting between the two.”\n\n“This is it then,” the words pour from your mouth. This time, they are yours. Not like when you spoke them to her. Memories. A blanket spread on the bluffs, overlooking the sea. Her warm body next to yours. Waking up to an empty vodka bottle. No hand to interlock with yours; it, instead, holds a hunter’s weapon.\n\nThe path is set, and there’s no going back. For the sake of closure. It never comes as expected. There’s not some sudden rush of feeling like that of a parent tucking you into bed. Life still moves on, with or without you.\n\n“This is it then,” Katia returns your words back to you. “Where will you go?”\n\nYou really have no idea. There are no ties holding you to a particular city. No employer. No lover. Some may consider that freedom. You could pack up at a moment’s time and leave on nothing but a simple impulse. But still, there’s something severely lacking: a sense of purpose. Some may thrive living without a sense of responsibility. Journeying to Devil’s Altar was a quick fix, a ripped tunic acting as a tourniquet. Not a long-term solution. The book could be a long-term solution… You shake that thought from your mind. The path’s already been chosen.\n\n“Do yourself a favor,” Katia speaks again. “Learn to live outside that head of yours. There’s a certain tenacity to you, a willpower guiding your actions for better or for worse. When your mind’s made up, you press on ignoring everything else, tunneling on the objective.”\n\n“That doesn’t sound like a particularly negative thing,” you comment.\n\n“No—but not every decision needs a hefty internal debate. Sometimes you just gotta pick the path and move on. Simple as that.”\n\nKatia stuffs the tome inside of her inner coat pocket. She flashes you a smile a final time before heading for the staircase. Before picking up your bow, you sift through the bodies on the floor. Wherever you’re headed, you’ll need supplies. Besides, it doesn’t look like the soldiers—or Jaina—need their equipment anymore. After taking a few military rations, tasteless but filling, you grab your bow and sling it on your back.\n\nThe world is before us. The possibilities are endless. Where to go? I can think of a good place to start. Back to where it all began, to the one who put this into motion. A certain lord hired you to hunt a peaceful man with ulterior motives. You’re tired of being used. You’re tired of being other people’s playthings. Betrayal: the siren song of your life. It’s time to sing it for another.\n","page 28":"“I have,” you answer, honestly.\n\nJaina and Lord Tiras briefly glance at one another. “And just what did he say?” Jaina asks.\n\nCards on the table. You’ve spoken the truth about Richter. But that doesn’t mean you need to tell them everything. “I discovered his body in Herald’s Fire. Took care of the man interrogating him. It was too late. I couldn’t save him.”\n\n“Yes, but what did he say?” Jaina repeats a second time.\n\n“He spoke of love,” you say. Another glance shared between the two. “He was seeing a waitress that worked there. Katia. With his dying breath he told me to take care of her.”\n\n“What do you think?” Lord Tiras says to Jaina, ignoring the fact that you can hear him.\n\n“I think he knows more,” Jaina answers in a similar manner.\n\n“I concur.”\n\nLord Tiras raps his knuckles on his desk. Immediately, the door to the study bursts open, and six guards rush in, followed by Jensen. Six pairs of eyes, wishing, daring you to misstep. Seems they got their wish, as debatable as the “misstep” may be. Shit. Coming to the lord’s keep is feeling like a mistake.\n\nTake the offensive. A quick apprehension may make the group second-guess themselves. You do just that, rushing towards the closest guard opening with a kick to his gut, stunning him in place. You grab a fistful of his tunic, using it for leverage as you spin around the man, your other hand pulling his sword from grasp. Suddenly you stop, allowing your momentum to carry through the man, sending him flying into his surrounding allies. Now armed, with the guards in disarray, you continue the assault.\n\nShort, quick bursts of movement is how you fight. Large sweeping maneuvers have no place when outnumbered, although they make for quite the spectacle. Such technique is meant for the arena or theater. Often those two places overlap. Winning the crowd is much the same as entertaining an audience. After competence, the thrill is all they care about. You adopt the opposite. Survival is all you care about, no matter how it looks.\n\nRecovered now, the six guards hold fast against your sudden assault, turning the tide, making you fight on the defense now. Not a good place when outnumbered. Better to look for a weak point and exploit. Playing defensive is only delaying the inevitable. You put all of your fury into the guard nearest to the exit, abandoning small parries and counters for heavy blows. Your sword crashes into his, hammering harder, attempting to overtake with sheer aggression.\n\nIt works…for a moment. You manage to land a clean hit, slicing through the man’s inner arm. Immediately, you make a break for the exit. You don’t need to defeat them all. Just enough to make your escape. As you near the door, a bright blast of blue fills the study. Pain sears through your legs. One moment you’re in full sprint, the next, you’re collapsed in a heap, pain filling your senses. The air around Jaina’s palms is filled with static energy, a result of the arcane blast just released. Several figures approach your fallen body.\n\nYou managed to live longer than expected, but still, this is not how the journey should end. It dawns on you that you never looked inside the pouch. Your final moment is spent wondering what it contained.\n","page 27":"“I have not,” you answer. “If anyone was out there searching for treasure, it would be Richter.”\n\n“A fair assumption,” Lord Tiras says. “Jaina, what do you think?”\n\nThe sorceress eyes you. “Our friend here isn’t well-versed in deceit. Personal riches don’t interest him, like it does most. He moves in a straight line, taking the direct route. Which begs the question, why would he lie?”\n\n“Well,” Lord Tiras starts. “Why would you?”\n\n“Why would I?” you echo. Generalizing your answer, you add on. “To protect a friend. If I felt dishonesty brought the most favorable outcome.”\n\n“And do you feel that now,” Lord Tiras questions, demandingly.\n\nBoth Lord Tiras and Jaina stare at you, distrust in their eyes, searching to pounce on one misspoken word.\n\n“No I don’t,” you answer, honestly. The truth is, you’re starting to think coming to Lord Tiras was a mistake. If you disclosed your conversation with Richter, the outcome is likely going to be the same. Either way, the outcome isn’t going to be the most favorable one.\n\n“Like I said, you’re not well-versed in deceit,” Jaina says. “That last portion was believable. Oh well. I’ll adopt your straight-forward manner for a moment. You’re not leaving here until you share everything you know.”\n\nShit. Jensen relieved you of your weapons too. You could surrender peacefully, sure. But the thought of interrogation, especially after what you’ve witnessed, doesn’t sit well. Better to have a fighting chance. Better to take the offensive. The margin of victory is slim, but it’s a greater chance than giving up.\n\nYou do just that, charging forward, taking a nearby book to fling as a distraction. The book flaps in the air, its pages flipping open in the sudden movement. Your fist connects with Jaina first, then aims for Lord Tiras. The second punch lands cleanly, scoring a crunching sound from the man’s nose. Your victory is short-lived, however, as a fully-recovered Jaina whispers her words of power. Blue light fires from her palms, tendrils of lightning cracking in a thunderous burst.\n\nA flash of light. Searing pain in your chest. Two figures stand over your body, a man and a woman. Your vision fades, tunneling inward, black at the edges. Boots. Your last thought is boots, two pairs of them standing just in front of you. Odd you never gave them much of a thought until now. Perhaps, realizing your misstep is too painful. Perhaps the mind latches onto the present when the spirit fades. Interesting. Your journey started with ending the Spirit of Truth. Now your spirit leaves you, and it started with a lie.\n","page 60":"“Hmm. Vomiting, convulsions, foaming,” Jaina ponders to herself. The soldiers around her remain silent. “Let’s see here.” She weaves her arms into a spell, whispering arcane words under her breath. Blue light floods from her palms into the book—rather, the light coats the book in a thin layer of magic. It hovers a moment before dissolving, the defensive curse gone with it.\n\nJaina speaks again, this time towards the nearest soldier. “Well, what are you waiting for? Pick it up.”\n\nThe man glances at his dead colleague and gulps nervously. He slowly approaches the book and timidly reaches his arms out, keeping his head as far away as possible, like it’s going to spring up at him. Two gloved hands wrap around a black tome. Noticing his eyes are involuntarily closed, the man peers an eye open. Realizing he’s, in fact, not dead, a smile breaks across his lips. “For you, milady,” he says with more confidence than before, offering the book to Jaina.\n\nThis is our chance. Jaina was kind to take care of the magical defenses for us. She’s exposed; take the shot. The ever-familiar weight of your bow focuses you in the moment. Many hunts, many situations it’s gotten you out of. The weapon has saved your life countless times, in more than just physically dangerous circumstances. It’s a symbol of your chance at redemption. Perhaps one day that’ll lie at the end of a hunt.\n\nShe left. Betrayed you to search for a life of adventure. Ironically, that’s the very life you lead now, catapulted into such a life after she left. What she seeks for was right in front of her, led astray by fanciful thinking and imagination. You hope she found it. Then at least one of you could have what you want. What you seek is seemingly just out of reach, always so, moving slightly further away with each outstretch of the arm. Peace. Contentment. Quieting of the mind.\n\nYour muscles flex with the bowstring draw. Once, a full draw was taxing on your arms. Once, nocking an arrow took deliberate attention. Now, both are handled with ease. It’s nothing more than tying the strings of your boots. Bow drawn, arrow released.\n\nThe instant it’s sent, you know it’ll land true. Countless arrows fired alert you to that fact. It’s a feeling. Steady hold. Target lined up. Breath exhaling. Smooth release, automatic, like the weapon knew when to loose the arrow. The string slides from your fingers, rubbing where heavy calluses have been built up. No jerk. No pull. Just release. Its trajectory is absolute.\n\nThe arrow flies through the air directly towards the back of Jaina’s head, still uncovered by her hood. Impact. No blood. Like glass shattering, the arcane protection Jaina casted explodes in a shower of light. Your arrow falls harmlessly to the floor. Jaina turns, meeting your eyes. She flashes you a smile.\n\n“I was wondering when you’d show up,” she says. “You know, you should have told me Richter gave you the cube. We could have traveled here together. You wouldn’t be able to pass the keep’s defenses otherwise.”\n\nYour eyes narrow. “What do you know about the cube? Were all of you hunting the Spirit of Truth for it?”\n\nJaina laughs. “In a word, yes. Do you really think that ‘deadly’ medical center provided much of a threat against Lord Tiras? Propaganda. All of it. Meant to lure someone with your skillset to lead us straight to the man. You always did focus too much on the task in front of you. You should really learn to look beyond the immediate.”\n\nThe soldiers accompanying Jaina shuffle their feet in nervousness. Not against you suddenly appearing. Against the fact that Jaina revealed their master’s less-than-noble approach to obtain the cube. It’s obvious who their allegiance lies with.\n\nAnger fills your mind. Anger against being used. She used you. Lord Tiras used you. Your traveling companions, Maxxx, Jaina, and Richter, used you. You aren’t some child’s toy to be played with. You should really learn to look beyond the immediate. Jaina’s words. You’re open to the advice. Your life hasn’t gone in the direction you’ve wanted so far. Might as well change things up a bit. Jaina’s words were meant as a taunt, but hell, you’re going to put them to good use.\n\nYour life flashes before your eyes, similar to how men speak of near-death experiences, although in your case, it’s in the opposite direction. You imagine a year from now, two, five even. In which direction are you heading? Will it be a constant cycle, taking job after job to keep yourself busy, to keep the mind occupied so it can’t look inward?\n\nYou’ve hunted men, exchanging blood for coins. It’s always been known who the true enemy is, however. The true enemy lies within. It’s the part of you that pulls towards self-destructive behavior. It’s the part of you that ignores those who offer a hand out while you’re lost in darkness. Will you continue the endless, inward fight or will you learn to change the battlefield?\n\nQuestions, too many questions pour into your mind. The future is uncertain. It holds many possible paths. You care little where it leads you as long as the enemy within can be conquered. You should really look beyond the immediate. You have. Jaina stands in your way, a mere obstacle on your way to self-mastery.\n\nHer shield is down. Fire another. You pull another arrow from your quiver, firing it with your next breath. It flies across the cavern directly at Jaina. At the last moment, one of her soldiers jumps in front of the sorceress and blocks the arrow with his shield. First deal with the soldiers. Most of them carry shields, so your bow will not be effective from your current location.\n\nAfter the first fell to the book’s curse, there are six left. Katia postures to fight alongside you, but you wave her back. She’ll just be a liability. A distraction, drawing your attention away. She still holds her crossbow, though. One lucky shot from her will make things significantly easier. Shields raised, the six converge on your position. They’re approaching quickly. Too quickly. Jaina must have whispered a few arcane words in their direction.\n\nYou only have time to fire one arrow, aiming low, underneath the shield of the nearest soldier. It pierces through his left greave, sending the man sprawling to the floor, magical speed thrusting him into a harder fall. Tossing your bow aside, having no time to properly sheathe it, you draw your blade ready to meet the soldiers’ onslaught.\n\nWith your recently experienced foresight, you’re not about to passively engage the soldiers. True, you’re outnumbered. The soldiers’ chainmail is much more protective than your light leather. And they have the support of a magic-wielder. The odds are highly against you. If this is how your story ends, hell if you won’t go without a fight. You match their charge with your own, parrying several sweeps as you meet.\n\nYour willingness to take the offensive surprises them for a moment. That’s all you need. You direct all your attention towards a soldier on your left, abandoning the others with a series of fury-filled heavy swings. He manages to block the first three, but then you break through, the fourth swing landing at the base of his neck. Not counting the man hit by your arrow, four to go. Your mind becomes a rush of memories. A flow state emerges, one that takes your mind from the present moment and the soldiers before you.\n\nSoft hands in your embrace. Tender kiss on your lips. Warmth of her body against yours. A strange outlook took hold. Suddenly, the world around you was full of opportunity. Hope. Each person in passing, each circumstance was a chance to experience more with her. That in itself took away the mundane. Nothing lacked excitement when she was near. (Faintly, you’re aware a bolt from Katia’s crossbow hits a soldier in the neck.) Then she started acting differently. You could tell. Your minor quips didn’t result in smiles. She seemed restless in your arms, a mind divided from the life she lived. Divided from you. Your best attempts weren’t good enough. Desperately, you tried to fill the gaps in her mind with your own. She left, taking it with her. Now you’re left in the cold with a mind split. Fragmented. Lost.\n\nBack to reality. You stand alone, bodies laying unmoving at your feet. No, not alone. Katia comes alongside next to you, putting the finishing touches on one fallen soldier still clinging to breath. Your eyes meet. Words remain unspoken. The biggest threat of all still remains. Jaina.\n\n“How romantic,” Jaina comments towards the two of you standing in pooling blood. “I do believe your little star-crossed journey has reached its final destination. There’s no ‘happily ever after’ in your future. I’m sorry, my former friend, but this is where you die.”\n\nJaina’s hand crackles with electricity. Blue tendrils release from her outstretched arm. You have a split-second to decide a course of action.\n","page 62":"This is it. This is the end. After traveling weeks to arrive here, this is how your story ends. Not with redemption or some grand adventure to share with your grandkids one day. Betrayal, the siren song of your life. Perhaps you can’t blame those around you for their actions. Perhaps you’re just playing the part of the fool. Jaina, a former ally. Now, greed guides her actions.\n\nOddly enough, you don’t feel hate towards the woman. Sure, you could harbor ill will against her for choosing this path. And that’s just it: she chose a path and stuck with it. You did the same. There’s really no blame to be had by either side. It’s just unfortunate you find yourself on the opposite side of a lightning bolt. Unsurprisingly, your mind draws back to her. To the place on the bluffs you called your own. To her blanket that you laid out. To her tender lips placed on your own. Your eyes close in anticipation.\n\n…\n\nThe blast never arrives. Sudden, searing pain doesn’t fill your body. Your eyes peer open. The ground lies blackened where Katia once stood, the woman herself gone from the position. After weeks of traveling, she’s gone in the blink of an eye, much like entering the keep.\n\nThen, movement.\n\nKatia appears on the other side of Jaina, a shadow appearing from mist, dagger in each hand. Jaina’s eyes open wide in surprise. Both blades plunge into her back, her defenses destroyed with your initial arrow shot. The sorceress collapses, the book falling on the ground next to her. Katia flashes you a smile through several strands of hair that have fallen in front of her face. She bends down to pick up the tome.\n\n“Don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re not the first to fall for the helpless maid act,” she says.\n\nThe illusions shatters. Whatever background you projected on the woman—along with the ones she told you—are gone. There is more than meets the eye with her. You shouldn’t be surprised. The siren song of your life echoes in your mind. You respond.\n\n“How long? How long were you working for him?”\n\nShe sighs. Regret? Not likely. Boredom, perhaps. “The entire time. Before you and I even met. I thought it would be Richter in your position, although when I saw you in that tavern I hedged my bet. Little did I know you would be so capable.”\n\n“Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint you,” you answer, eyes casually glancing to where your bow lies on the ground. “Where does this leave us?”\n\n“I admit I have grown a certain fondness towards you, as hazardous as it is to the profession…”\n\nYou interject. “And which profession would that be exactly?”\n\n“Need you be so thorough?” Katia stares at you a moment. “Of course you do. I forgot who I was speaking to. I’m part of an…exclusive organization. Well, currently I’m just an acolyte. Nine there are. No more, no less. This book here is my ticket into a formal challenge with one of the Nine.”\n\n“You would leave a trail of bodies just for a challenge?” you ask.\n\n“Please. Like you’re so innocent yourself,” Katia answers. She’s not wrong.\n\n“It’s not morality that guides the question,” you say. “That book is worth a fortune. And you would trade it for an uncertain outcome. If it were me, I’d put it towards something more imminent.”\n\n“Sure you would. That’s why she left you isn’t it? Yeah, I did my research on you. I can tell you it’s more extensive than whatever rumors this sorceress found out. Our organization has eyes everywhere. Sleepers. Even in the most far out, unheard of towns, our watchful gaze is present. Your former life was a bit too secure for her, huh? No adventures into the unknown. No risk. No danger. Her life didn’t end up quite the way she wanted.”\n\n“…you know of where she went?”\n\n“You’re not that thick-headed. Didn’t you just hear me? We have eyes everywhere. Yes, I know what came of your wife’s—former wife’s—‘life of adventure.’ She settled down. Met some plain old farmer. Not exactly the thrilling life she left you for, eh?”\n\nThe hair on your skin stands up. A strange feeling washes over you, similar to the one you experienced during your first battle. She…settled down. With a farmer, no less. Lies, all of it. Her reasons for leaving. Bullshit. All of it. Left the comfort of your arms for another. Lies, all of it.\n\nYour mind flashes back, not to your time with her, but to the moment when you decided to travel to Devil’s Altar. For the sake of closure. Partially for Katia, partially for you. Somehow this doesn’t bring conclusion to your former life. It should. The biggest question in your mind is answered, and nothing’s changed. Emptiness still fills your heart. Richter’s dying plea was built on a lie. Whatever grand plans you had for tracking her down, having things the way they used to be, is dissolved. There’s nothing left. All have abandoned you.\n\n“Doing ok?” Katia asks, genuine concern on her face. Lies, all of it. No, she can’t be trusted. Give her nothing back. I have grown a certain fondness of you. Your heart hardens, more than ever before. More than you ever thought possible. What’s left for you? More hunts? Keeping yourself busy with work and drink to numb the pain? It’s not a solid plan, but it’s a plan nonetheless.\n\n“Just as well as I’ve always been,” you answer. “So where does this leave us?”\n\n“Well,” Katia begins. “You could allow pride to guide your actions and try to take the book from me, although I wouldn’t advise that option.” She flips her daggers in her hands for emphasis. “Or we both could walk out of here and go our separate ways. No hard feelings. I chose my path. Now you get to choose yours.”\n","page 61":"“Hmm. Vomiting, convulsions, foaming,” Jaina ponders to herself. The soldiers around her remain silent. “Let’s see here.” She weaves her arms into a spell, whispering arcane words under her breath. Blue light floods from her palms into the book—rather, the light coats the book in a thin layer of magic. It hovers a moment before dissolving, the defensive curse gone with it.\n\nJaina speaks again, this time towards the nearest soldier. “Well, what are you waiting for? Pick it up.”\n\nThe man glances at his dead colleague and gulps nervously. He slowly approaches the book and timidly reaches his arms out, keeping his head as far away as possible, like it’s going to spring up at him. Two gloved hands wrap around a black tome. Noticing his eyes are involuntarily closed, the man peers an eye open. Realizing he’s, in fact, not dead, a smile breaks across his lips. “For you, milady,” he says with more confidence than before, offering the book to Jaina.\n\nThis is our chance. Jaina was kind to take care of the magical defenses for us. She’s exposed; take the shot. The ever-familiar weight of your bow focuses you in the moment. Many hunts, many situations it’s gotten you out of. The weapon has saved your life countless times, in more than just physically dangerous circumstances. It’s a symbol of your chance at redemption. Perhaps one day that’ll lie at the end of a hunt.\n\nShe left. Betrayed you to search for a life of adventure. Ironically, that’s the very life you lead now, catapulted into such a life after she left. What she seeks for was right in front of her, led astray by fanciful thinking and imagination. You hope she found it. Then at least one of you could have what you want. What you seek is seemingly just out of reach, always so, moving slightly further away with each outstretch of the arm. Peace. Contentment. Quieting of the mind.\n\nYour muscles flex with the bowstring draw. Once, a full draw was taxing on your arms. Once, nocking an arrow took deliberate attention. Now, both are handled with ease. It’s nothing more than tying the strings of your boots. Bow drawn, arrow released.\n\nThe instant it’s sent, you know it’ll land true. Countless arrows fired alert you to that fact. It’s a feeling. Steady hold. Target lined up. Breath exhaling. Smooth release, automatic, like the weapon knew when to loose the arrow. The string slides from your fingers, rubbing where heavy calluses have been built up. No jerk. No pull. Just release. Its trajectory is absolute.\n\nThe arrow flies through the air directly towards the back of Jaina’s head, still uncovered by her hood. Impact. No blood. Like glass shattering, the arcane protection Jaina casted explodes in a shower of light. Your arrow falls harmlessly to the floor. Jaina turns, meeting your eyes. She flashes you a smile.\n\n“I was wondering when you’d show up,” she says. “You know, you should have told me Richter gave you the cube. We could have traveled here together. You wouldn’t be able to pass the keep’s defenses otherwise.”\n\nYour eyes narrow. “What do you know about the cube? Were all of you hunting the Spirit of Truth for it?”\n\nJaina laughs. “In a word, yes. Do you really think that ‘deadly’ medical center provided much of a threat against Lord Tiras? Propaganda. All of it. Meant to lure someone with your skillset to lead us straight to the man. You always did focus too much on the task in front of you. You should really learn to look beyond the immediate.”\n\nThe soldiers accompanying Jaina shuffle their feet in nervousness. Not against you suddenly appearing. Against the fact that Jaina revealed their master’s less-than-noble approach to obtain the cube. It’s obvious who their allegiance lies with.\n\nAnger fills your mind. Anger against being used. She used you. Lord Tiras used you. Your traveling companions, Maxxx, Jaina, and Richter, used you. You aren’t some child’s toy to be played with. You should really learn to look beyond the immediate. Jaina’s words. You’re open to the advice. Your life hasn’t gone in the direction you’ve wanted so far. Might as well change things up a bit. Jaina’s words were meant as a taunt, but hell, you’re going to put them to good use.\n\nYour life flashes before your eyes, similar to how men speak of near-death experiences, although in your case, it’s in the opposite direction. You imagine a year from now, two, five even. In which direction are you heading? Will it be a constant cycle, taking job after job to keep yourself busy, to keep the mind occupied so it can’t look inward?\n\nYou’ve hunted men, exchanging blood for coins. It’s always been known who the true enemy is, however. The true enemy lies within. It’s the part of you that pulls towards self-destructive behavior. It’s the part of you that ignores those who offer a hand out while you’re lost in darkness. Will you continue the endless, inward fight or will you learn to change the battlefield?\n\nQuestions, too many questions pour into your mind. The future is uncertain. It holds many possible paths. You care little where it leads you as long as the enemy within can be conquered. You should really look beyond the immediate. You have. Jaina stands in your way, a mere obstacle on your way to self-mastery.\n\nHer shield is down. Fire another. You pull another arrow from your quiver, firing it with your next breath. It flies across the cavern directly at Jaina. At the last moment, one of her soldiers jumps in front of the sorceress and blocks the arrow with his shield. First deal with the soldiers. Most of them carry shields, so your bow will not be effective from your current location.\n\nAfter the first fell to the book’s curse, there are six left. Katia postures to fight alongside you, but you wave her back. She’ll just be a liability. A distraction, drawing your attention away. She still holds her crossbow, though. One lucky shot from her will make things significantly easier. Shields raised, the six converge on your position. They’re approaching quickly. Too quickly. Jaina must have whispered a few arcane words in their direction.\n\nYou only have time to fire one arrow, aiming low, underneath the shield of the nearest soldier. It pierces through his left greave, sending the man sprawling to the floor, magical speed thrusting him into a harder fall. Tossing your bow aside, having no time to properly sheathe it, you draw your blade ready to meet the soldiers’ onslaught.\n\nWith your recently experienced foresight, you’re not about to passively engage the soldiers. True, you’re outnumbered. The soldiers’ chainmail is much more protective than your light leather. And they have the support of a magic-wielder. The odds are highly against you. If this is how your story ends, hell if you won’t go without a fight. You match their charge with your own, parrying several sweeps as you meet.\n\nYour willingness to take the offensive surprises them for a moment. That’s all you need. You direct all your attention towards a soldier on your left, abandoning the others with a series of fury-filled heavy swings. He manages to block the first three, but then you break through, the fourth swing landing at the base of his neck. Not counting the man hit by your arrow, four to go. Your mind becomes a rush of memories. A flow state emerges, one that takes your mind from the present moment and the soldiers before you.\n\nSoft hands in your embrace. Tender kiss on your lips. Warmth of her body against yours. A strange outlook took hold. Suddenly, the world around you was full of opportunity. Hope. Each person in passing, each circumstance was a chance to experience more with her. That in itself took away the mundane. Nothing lacked excitement when she was near. (Faintly, you’re aware a bolt from Katia’s crossbow hits a soldier in the neck.) Then she started acting differently. You could tell. Your minor quips didn’t result in smiles. She seemed restless in your arms, a mind divided from the life she lived. Divided from you. Your best attempts weren’t good enough. Desperately, you tried to fill the gaps in her mind with your own. She left, taking it with her. Now you’re left in the cold with a mind split. Fragmented. Lost.\n\nBack to reality. You stand alone, bodies laying unmoving at your feet. No, not alone. Katia comes alongside next to you, putting the finishing touches on one fallen soldier still clinging to breath. Your eyes meet. Words remain unspoken. The biggest threat of all still remains. Jaina.\n\n“How romantic,” Jaina comments towards the two of you standing in pooling blood. “I do believe your little star-crossed journey has reached its final destination. There’s no ‘happily ever after’ in your future. I’m sorry, my former friend, but this is where you die.”\n\nJaina’s hand crackles with electricity. Blue tendrils release from her outstretched arm. You have a split-second to decide a course of action.\n","page 20":"You may have been too late to save the rogue, but at least you can see to his body. You weren’t close. He simply was a set of skills needed for the task. Still, weeks of traveling with one another, it makes you see them in a different light. Experience is the tightest bond there is. He doesn’t deserve to die like this. Pulling your dagger, you start to cut the rope holding Richter to the post. As the first few strands are cut, Richter suddenly gurgles, coming awake from a sleep you thought eternal. A few drops land on your overcoat.\n\n“…came back for me, huh?” Richter’s voice is but a haggard whisper.\n\nYou reply, keeping a similar volume as not to overwhelm the man. “Someone’s after us. All of us. They seek—”\n\n“—I know,” Richter cuts you off. “A book. Tell me, do you know which one?”\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n“Heh… (cough)” You finish cutting the rope and slowly guide Richter’s body down, placing his back against the post. He continues. “It contains great power. The selling price is worth more than a few small kingdoms. But that’s not what interests you, is it? No, you never pursued the finer things in life. Funny, now I understand. Tell me, have you ever been in love?”\n\nA blanket spread out on the grass, placed underneath strong pine. Its leaves rustle with the wind, creating phantom spectators watching the two of you. The wind, a cool breeze. The moon, your only light. Her body, warm comfort. Only her outline is visible, a sensual silhouette in the night. Each familiar touch brings images, memories of time spent in the light. It’s the way it should be. Simple. Uncomplicated. Just the two of you. Tomorrow can wait. Tonight it’s just the two of you.\n\nYou shake your head to clear the memory. Richter takes that as your answer. “Shame. Cynicism kept me from finding it earlier. I wish I had more time with her. (Cough). Here at the end, she’s all I can think of. That’s why I’m staying here, the place where she works.”\n\nA sinking feeling begins in your chest. Bringing his focus back, you ask, “And what do you know of the book?”\n\nRichter’s grin appears, bright teeth poking through dried blood. Even now, his apparent deception is something he’s proud of. “More than most. Its location, for one. The promises it keeps, for two. It’s of dark magic, an ancient curse if you believe that sort of thing. The Spirit of Truth held a certain…missing puzzle piece.”\n\n“Which is?”\n\nRichter breaks into another fit of coughing, gurgling. His body convulses, meaning to empty his stomach’s contents. Hacking, Richter shoves two fingers down his throat, triggering his gag reflex. In a waterfall of brown mess, taking away your appetite for stew, vomit pours down the front of Richter’s torso along with a small leather bag, not unlike the one used to transport small jewelry. He motions for you to pick it up.\n\n“That will take you to the book.”\n\n“Why are you telling me?” you ask.\n\n“Isn’t it obvious? You could have skipped town, but instead (cough), you came to rescue me. Take it. Find the book. And promise me…”\n\nYou have a feeling what his next words will be.\n\n“…you’ll take care of Katia.”\n\nYou remain silent as breath escapes Richter for the final time. Your hand reaches for the leather bag, wiping it down with the dead man’s cloak. So, Richter is the cause. Out of the four, he was the most likely to snatch an item of worth. Many questions fill your head. The book’s origin, those who seek it, Richter’s involvement, Katia, the possibility of seeking Lord Tiras for help. Answers are scarce. Weigh the options, then commit. Whether you choose right or wrong, the journey begins by taking a step forward.\n","page 63":"There’s no time to think. She stood by you in the end. Long have you traveled to arrive here. Perhaps it’s due to your recent flood of memories or the fact that you might not make it out of the keep alive. But damn if you won’t act for someone else for once, at least since she left you. Putting all your strength into the maneuver, you wrap your arms around Katia and tackle her to the ground.\n\nSearing pain. The bolt of energy lands squarely into your back, severing your spine and paralyzing you instantly. Blood from the soldiers splash in the air as you fall, dying the side of your face in red, like warpaint. Katia pinned underneath you, face and clothes painted the same red, attempts to push you off of her.\n\nShe’s too slow, however. And in your state, you’re unable to aid. Jaina’s boots echo in the cavern as she approaches the pair of you.\n\n“And to think, she would have betrayed you. It wouldn’t be the first time if my sources are correct,” Jaina says. “I didn’t expect such heroics from you. Do you really care about her that much? Our own journey, short as it was, never saw you putting yourself in harm’s way for one of us. I doubt you would have risked your life for Maxx, that big old softy. No matter. You’ll both be dead soon.”\n\nKatia finally manages to roll out from underneath you, but that leaves you face first in a pool of blood. You struggle to breath, the blood trying it’s damndest to drown you. A death of your own making. Such clarity only comes with the end. This must truly be where your journey ends.\n\n“You know nothing of me,” Katia answers back.\n\nJaina laughs. “I know you’d likely steal my reward if left to your own device. I know your only reason for leading us here is because you’re too weak to complete the mission on your own.”\n\nKatia led them here?\n\n“Wrong. I lured you here to end the search. Plus, I needed a few expendable men to help dispose of the traps,” Katia says, alluding towards the soldiers around you. Does that include us? “The book taken, his prized whore dealt with, Lord Tiras will have no choice but to abandon the search. Once I learn of the book’s secrets, it will be too dangerous to continue the pursuit.”\n\n“Fool. You don’t understand the arcane. Reading the book’s contents will likely result in your destruction.”\n\n“Perhaps,” Katia wonders aloud. “One way to find out for certain. After dealing with you, of course.” A struggle ensues. Arcane magic fills the cavern in response. You don’t live long enough to see the victor.\n","page 0":"Snow crunches underneath your footsteps. The thin layer isn’t thick enough to limit your movement. It\u0027s only about an inch deep as the grass beneath is still able to poke its green tips through. Several pairs of boots follow behind you. Three to be exact. The hunter, you lead from the front.\n\nKneeling, examining the trail, you speak. “Silvaras is close. These prints are fresh. See how the snowfall hasn’t affected the prints much, if at all.”\n\n“How soon until he reaches the pass?” asks Jaina, a sorceress who hates to repeat herself. She’s dressed in a hood of blue, trimmed with white fur along the edges.\n\nYour head lifts slightly in thought, vision stretching gazeless, unfocused on a single point in front of you. Easier to think when your immediate senses aren’t playing a distraction. “Three hours if the weather continues like this. Possibly four with a heavier snowfall.”\n\n“We best get moving then,” Maxx comments in a deep rumble. How he manages to keep pace with his heavy plate and tower shield is beyond you.\n\n“I must say, I agree with the big fellow…for once,” the final member of your party, Richter, inputs. After traveling weeks with the man, you still don’t feel comfortable sleeping around him. Things of value tend to disappear within his presence.\n\n“Onward then. Our prey grows weary.” You rise, breathing in the cold mountain air. Pine trees, lightly covered in white, stand proudly around you. The trail you follow grows in elevation the further you press on. Silvaras has eluded you for too long. The former guard captain, turned traitor, has been a thorn in Lord Tiras’ side for almost a year now. His revolution founded the militant organization calling themselves the “Spirit of Truth” is gaining momentum throughout the territory. Cultists, seeking to gain personal wealth through religion, in spite of Lord Tiras, needed to end. Lord Tiras’ men failed at every attempt. That’s where you come in. Your traveling companions are simply necessary expenses in order to succeed at the task. You press on.\n\nThe path takes you up a twisting road, turning into a series of switchbacks. Steady breath and steady footsteps makes the journey blend into a timeless, subconscious one. Your reality becomes the next step, the next breath, only to repeat itself a moment later. Everything else is simply a backdrop, supporting actors playing their part in your story. It’s happening again. Focus. Breathe. Remember to…\n\nThe next switchback opens into a clearing. A few trees cover your current location, but taking ten steps forward would expose you to the camp. It’s a series of tents arranged in a circle. Silvaras wasn’t running towards the pass. Rather, towards the destination in front of you. The center one, the largest, draws your attention, not because of its size, but because of the symbol displayed on the canvas, a cross with a pair of wings behind it, commonly used to signify a medical ward.\n\nWhatever the specifics, it means healing attention could be had. This is the camp of the militant deserter? No, stick to the job. It’s not your place to question. There are few guards posted. Guards should be positioned at the top of the switchbacks. It’s the natural place to set up a defense. The entire camp looks too…civilian. No, stick to the job. It’s not your place to question. You press on.\n\nThe snowfall is heavier now, masking your approach in sheer whiteness, a misty cloud hiding all that’s within. Strange. Even as you draw close, guards aren’t posted outside. Wait, there’s a few. They aren’t patrolling like they should. They’re standing in casual conversation, oblivious to the four figures infiltrating their camp. You cut them down in the very same manner. Casually.\n\nYour arrows fire true. Three let loose, three hit the mark. A few throwing knives from Richter join as insurance, not that it is needed. Still, it never hurts to be careful, a lesson the camp is currently learning. Silvaras must be in the large tent. He wouldn’t risk his life, the survival of the Spirit of Truth, for anything else. Taking the overcoats from the guards, leaving Maxx behind—not that the coats would fit him, you slip inside, disguised, along with Jaina and Richter.\n\nInside, cots fill the area, neatly, like the way a farmer would sow seeds.\n\n“Oh, you must be the…” a man begins before cutting off, apparently recognizing you aren’t who your cloaks display. Silvaras. He isn’t wearing armor. Rather, he wears the apron of a surgeon, medical tools displayed on his belt. The man’s graying hair is neatly cut, a military man used to obeying orders without question. Something obviously changed. “I see. Very well, walk with me. I have a surgery to perform. You can fulfill your task after.”\n\nYou sense no deception in the man, and the camp poses the same threat as the three guards you felled. “Any sort of deviance from your task and you’ll be ended swiftly,” you say.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, then me and everyone in here dies. Got it,” Silvaras comments, leading you down the rows of beds.\n\nThe subject lies on a surgical table, one built sturdy from oak and sanded down to a smooth surface. Tears run down the woman’s face, but that’s not what catches your attention. Your eyes are immediately drawn to her stomach. She’s pregnant, near the estimated due date by the looks of it. Her feet are flat on the table, knees bent, giving Silvaras room to work. Silvaras takes her pulse, then checks between her legs. This certainly isn’t the surgery you were expecting.\n\n“So Lord Tiras sent you,” Silvaras says as he continues to work on the woman. “Figures. That man is the type to take anything personally. It’s not normally my place to disobey orders. There gets to a certain point when a man must act on his heart, even in opposition to the laws of the land.”\n\nJaina jumps in. “And how does the murder of one’s countryman go against your heart?”\n\nSilvaras pauses for a moment. Then answers. “No, no. Is that what Tiras is spinning these days? These people here are refugees. There’s a civil war happening on the other side of the pass. Nasty war. I merely wanted to allow them residence. Tiras closed the border. Decreed that anyone attempting to cross into the land is doing so illegally. We were ordered to execute them. Hell, the pass isn’t even large enough for an enemy force to march through.”\n\n“Spies. Sleeper agents,” Richter says, picking a piece of dirt from his fingernail. “It’s the perfect opportunity to slip an operative into the territory. I don’t blame the lord.”\n\n“Heartless fool! And if you were on the opposite side?” Silvaras questions.\n\nRichter flashes a toothy grin. “I wouldn’t travel through such an exposed area, even if it’s sparsely supported with soldiers. Naturally, I’d pick the winning side of the civil war and lend my services.”\n\n“We’re getting off topic. Keep speaking,” you say.\n\n“What more is there to say?” Silvaras answers. “We’ve set up a temporary medical camp to house refugees. The Spirit of Truth isn’t the militant organization you’re led to believe. Quite the opposite actually. The only violence we’re guilty of—pass me that knife there—is during direct confrontation from Tiras’ men. It’s unfortunate, yes. But we’re able to save many more lives being alive. That’s the only reason we take up arms. In defense. We’re a peaceful group now. We’ve been part of the bloodshed for far too long. You see, this is our redemption.”\n\nSilvaras pulls a crying baby from the woman connected, still, with its umbilical. The babe is covered in liquid. Obviously female. With the knife you handed to Silvaras, he severs the physical tie between mother and daughter, then places the baby in her mother’s arms.\n\n“Now, assassin, where were we?”\n\nStick to the job. It’s not your place to question. The situation may not be as black and white as you were led to believe, but isn’t that the case for most things? No one is truly good, despite their misguided attempts at redemption. Silvaras\u0027 own words condemn him. Righteous men don’t seek redemption, only those who walk in darkness. You’re willing to bet Silvaras traveled deep into the abyss, turning back after standing in the shadow of a larger monster.\n\nPerspective, it can change a man. So can fear. You have a job to do. It’s your only reality, the only thing that matters. Everything else is faded into nonexistence. One thing remains. The job. Lord Tiras hired you to put an end to the Spirit of Truth. The organization will crumble without Silvaras’ leadership. But how many more will he save? It doesn’t matter. There are sick people that need his help. There are other medical experts in the world. He’s not evil. That makes one of us.\n\nBefore anyone can react, you nock and loose an arrow, snapping Silvaras’ head back with the impact. His face doesn’t even look surprised. His body collapses against the delivery table, sending the new mother into a wail rivaling her child. Right, wrong, whatever your decision turns out to be, you can’t let emotions sway you from the task. That’s what Silvaras tried to do. He tried to manipulate us, an appeal to our humanity. It won’t…it didn’t work. Bastard. He deserved his fate. God knows you deserve yours.\n"}
