You prefer to be around soldiers, who are simpler, down to earth and ready to do whatever\u0027s worse. Still, the politicians are people you have to deal with. There\u0027s a Creator, a Probiscan, a Moogli, a Remnant, a Chosen, Tarn, a Brain Bug and a Garavan, as well as four humans including yourself, though it\u0027s clear that the four humans wield nearly all of the power. Well, technically, three and a half. The half, Cabana, walks up to you.\n\n\nCabana is the only case of interspecies breeding ever recorded, and is an interesting case. His mother was impregnated by an unknown alien parasite with surprisingly similar biology to humans, leading to Cabana\u0027s birth. Cabana\u0027s pale green skin is prone to cracking releasing waves of blood and mucus, he has no hair, he requires extensive medicine to survive and has many other medical issues. Still, the man\u0027s a loyal and trustworthy friend.\n\n\n\"Achilles! How are you? I\u0027m lying, I don\u0027t care. You\u0027re late, sit down.\" Cabana says.\n\n\nYou take your place next to Cabana and Senator Chang, the other human, who\u0027s considerably better at politics and public speaking than you. Today\u0027s agenda is mainly about the Chykri. A negotiations team has been sent to discuss a peace negotiation with the Chykri. There were no survivors.\n\n\nSenator O\u0027Hara, a human politician who clearly only got his position because of his humanity, takes the stand.\n\n\n\"Good evening, fellow Senators. I would like to thank you all for coming. We have multiple issues to be dealt with. The Scairtt need to be convinced to start giving troops and ships to the Coalition. We should send a diplomacy team. I propose we send Senator Cabana, Senator Achilles, Commander Delta-1, Grand Admiral Yarcel and Lesser Chieftain Thar\u0027Kaan.\"\n\n\nYou take out your tablet, which is used to quickly vote on a topic.\n","page 33":"\"Achilles!\"\n\n\nYou look up from your current project, a plan to reinforce CDF with retired attack animals such as Dogs, Flurets, Fenrir and Pumi Garavan, and turn to Cabana.\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s a lot of complaints about... Well, everybody, about the level of tech we have in the army. It seems most military tech comes from the Elysium project.\"\n\n\n\"Oh yeah.\" Admiral Yarcel yells. \"What the hell\u0027s with the Greek names? I\u0027m getting really sick of all the Greek goddamn names of the tech my men are using.\"\n\n\n\"All Probiscan tech is named after sea creatures.\"\n\n\n\"Well, alright. We\u0027ll keep some of the terrible Greek names. But we need new tech.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s the Daedalus Facility on the Daedalus moon. They\u0027re working on new tech.\" Cabana adds.\n","page 32":"The choices for the War Council quickly becomes apparent. Grand Admiral Yarcel, Tarn Commander Delta-1, Lesser Chieftain Thar\u0027Kaan, General Gig, Commando Ashley-Dante, Commissar Mast and of course, Cabana. You organize your first meeting in the Main Chamber of the Probiscan Claw-mark Battleship the Maw, a room specifically designed to hold the War Council. When you arrive, you see why. There\u0027s a massive monitor, a holographic board to display a battlefield for tactical decisions. The seats are also personally designed, with a massive metal chair for Delta-1 and an aquatic tank built under the assumption that a Scairtt leader would join the War Council. You take your seat, which is a massive oak chair with gold trim that\u0027s more like a throne. The other leaders file in and take their seats, and you quickly assess the commanders based on what you know of them, previous experiences with them and their history.\n\n\nCabana is a loyal friend and a bit of a clown, but behind his hideous face, disgusting smile and cheerful attitude is a genius mind that can make hard decisions and be incredibly smart in his attitude.\n\n\nGrand Admiral Yarcel is in charge of the Maw and an incredibly popular man of the people. He represents the average troops, but has also proven to be a brutal and efficient leader who\u0027s won many battles. He is one of the most famous Probiscans, and has massive amounts of influence in the Alliance.\n\n\nLesser Chieftain Thar\u0027Kaan is a psychopath. The commander is a tough, brutal leader who has personally skinned enemies of the Coalition. He is cold, calculating and bloodthirsty.\n\n\nGeneral Gig is a Brain Bug. She is in charge of a massive group of terrifying death machines such as spaceships, tanks and other war machines. She is a proud and friendly person, and despite usually inhabiting a massive tank that could wipe out an entire city.\n\n\nCommander Delta-1 is a soldier, first and foremost, and a Remnant hero. Despite being a Commander, he still takes part in every battle he can. He hates whatever enemy is at hand, loves his allies, and is eager to get into a fight.\n\n\nCommissar Mast is a Moogli Commissar and a tactical genius. He is constantly making decisions, and has seemingly knows every great military commander\u0027s tactics and has improved on them.\n\n\nTarn is an alien hivemind who is made up of billions of Tarn Drone bodies. His military experiance will be invaluable.\n\n\nFinally, Commando Ashley-Dante is a quiet Clone. She rarely speaks up, but whenever she talks she imparts incredible wisdom. Despite her quiet and shy demeanor, you\u0027ve seen footage of her personally kill a dozen Garavan assassins in melee with a machete.\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Senator, and more importantly, General Achilles. You are the smartest minds and the greatest fighters in the galaxy, and probably the universe. Some of you are old Coalition, some Alliance, some Thar\u0027Garavan. None of that matters now. The Coalition has the Chykri at our doorstep. We don\u0027t know their motives. We don\u0027t know their reasons. We only know they want to kill us, so we need to kill them first. Our task is to build up a force that\u0027ll send an army of cyborg-monsters running. So let\u0027s get to work.\"\n","page 35":"\"No. Keep the tech the same. Let\u0027s go meet the Scairtt as soon as possible.\"\n","page 34":"\"Fine. If any of you have proposals for new tech, submit them to me.\" You reply.\n\n\n\"Perfect. Now that we\u0027ve united all species, we can have the galaxy\u0027s smartest engineers working together on the project.\"\" Cabana replies.\n\n\n\"Just get to work. We have a lot of work to do. We\u0027ll pay a visit to Daedalus right before we visit the Scairtt. Who has proposals?\"\n\n\nSeveral hands raise, and you sigh.\n\n\n\"Alright. What do we have, then?\"\n","page 37":"\"Fine. I\u0027ll authorize the project.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect. I\u0027ll make sure the Void ships are a success. They\u0027ll be incredible war machines, sir.

Change it.\"\n\n\n\"To what?\"\n\n\n\"Something Greek.\"\n\n\nYarcel raises his hands in frustration.\n\n\n\"Really? Void ships wasn\u0027t a good name? I\u0027m getting real sick of these names. No, I refuse to allow myself to get mad about this. Fine. What about... I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not familiar with Greek mythology. \n\n\nAshley-Dante raises her hand.\n\n\n\"How about Tartarus Ships? That\u0027s Greek, to my knowledge, though it could be Roman.\" She says.\n\n\n\"Perfect.\" You reply. \"Get it done, Admiral Yarcel.\n\n\nSoon, the Tartarus Ships begin construction. Early prototypes and tests are successful, and you have great hope that this will succeed.\"\n","page 36":"\"Achilles, look at this new design.\"\n\n\nYou walk over to a massive ship the size of a Behemoth ship.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve had the plans drawn up. I call it the Void Ship. It takes the famed ship weapons from humanity, Probiscan-designed engines, Mundar hulls, Brain Bug control systems, Creator Stealth Systems, the Remnant shields, Chosen Medical facilities and so forth. Basically, the best stuff from all races. They\u0027d be completely self-sufficient and able to take on entire enemy fleets. It will require serious funding, but I think it\u0027ll be worth it.\"\n","page 39":"\"I introduce, the Laelaps Project.” The massive Commissar says, holding forth a small, holographic tablet displaying a robot gorilla-bear-dog, with a scale indicating they\u0027re the size of a Black Bear.\n\n\n“What?” You ask.\n\n\n“The Laelaps Project.

The six kneeling soldiers are all blindfolded and gagged, but they’re alive. There’s two humans, a Garavan, a massive, heavily chained Remnant, a Probiscan and  a Moogli. The Master raises his pistol, and uses a knife to slice off the gag and blindfold. The Moogli looks at the Master, than at the camera, before bowing his head.\n\n\n“Beg for mercy. I’ll make your end quick.” The Master says.\n\n\nThe Moogli doesn’t respond, so the Master raises his pistol and shoots the Moogli multiple times in the head. The goes to the Remnant, who is chained to the ground with massive metal chains, and has his voice speakers blocked by padded material. The Master repeats his prcoess and asks the same request. This time, the Remnant struggles considerably against his chains, and continues struggling as the Master begins firing shot after shot into the Remnant’s head. Eventually, the Remnant’s body stops struggling, and slumps down in the snow.\n\n\nThe first human comes next. After he’s ungagged, he lets out a yell.\n\n\n“For the Coalition! For…!” He yells.\n\n\nHis head explodes as the Master fires several shots into the captives head.\n\n\nThe Garavan is next. He sits quietly as he’s unblindfolded. As soon as his gag is removed he charges. His teeth bite into the Master’s forearm, tearing into as much flesh as possible. The Master slams the Garavan to the ground, and fires multiple shots into the Garavan’s spine, before finishing him off with a shot to the head. The Probiscan  begins to yell something in his whistle language, so you switch on your translator.\n\n\n“We are the Coalition! We are many! We are strong! We will…!”\n\n\nThe Probiscans heartening speech is also cut short by a single bullet. Finally, there’s the last human. You recognize him a Human Sergeant, in charge of the rest of the soldiers. The sergeant looks at the Master and spits on him, before he\u0027s shot in the head. The camera shifts view, to show dozens of kneeling soldiers. Three Gunheads stand in front of them, and open fire. Within seconds, the prisoners are all dead. The camera shifts view to show the Master.\n\n\n\"This is a warning to the Coalition.\" It says in English, which surprises you greatly. \"Surrender now, and we shall let many of you live.

The black-hearts are those who have followed the path of war and destruction, becoming soldiers, mercenaries, pirates and raiders. They value brutality and pragmatism. The soft-skins are those who have forsaken tradition to live in the city and become politicians, scientists, engineers. They are those who value intelligence and progressiveness. Then there are the wide-eyes, who have followed the true nomadic urge and went to travel the stars, discovering new planets and worlds and seeing the universe.

It has a cylindrical top and two lasers on either side, followed by an unarmed man. A concrete wall appears and the Drone fires through it, burning holes in  the concrete. The minigun fires at the unarmed man, but the drone activates it\u0027s shield to protect the man.\n\n\n\"This is the Stymphalian Drone. They\u0027re capable of supporting units, shielding units and generally assisting soldiers in battle.\"\n\n\nThe Drone leaves, and the unarmed man takes out a small, bulky wrist-mounted pod, and presses it. A swarm of nanobots fly out, and the minigun fires at the unarmed man. The nanobots begin flying in front of the bullets, shielding the man.\n\n\n\"This is the Aegis Swarm, designed to protect soldiers and officers from fire in the middle of battle.\"\n\n\nThe unarmed man presses a button and the nanobot retreat into the wrist-mounted pod, and walk off. A Moogli and a Pumi\u0027Garavan enter, and the Moogli draws a silver syringe and a machine pistol. The Moogli fires multiple shots into the Pumi\u0027Garavan, which collapses. The Moogli injects it with the syringe, and after a few minutes, the Pumi\u0027Garavan\u0027s wounds are repaired, and it\u0027s able to get up and walk out.\n\n\n\"That was the Asclepius Syringe, able to repair wounds quickly and easily.\"\n\n\nFinally, a Probiscan walks out, as a large metal wall appears. The Probiscan takes out a grey rifle, and fires. A massive pink laser comes out and burns through the metal wall. The Probiscan shoulders his rifle and walks out.\n\n\n\"That was the SKORPION Rifle, an anti-tank weapon. Interesting fact, the pink laser is not actually the damaging force, it\u0027s to help aim. The real damaging laser is unable to see with the human eye.

As soon as the bell rings, Thar\u0027Kaan raises his two knives and Sklain raises a small sabre. Thar\u0027Kaan charges forwards, diving through the air. He ducks under a sword swing and slashes two long cuts across Sklain\u0027s chest, before rolling to the side. Sklain thrusts his sword, cutting a hole in Thar\u0027Kaan\u0027s shoulder letting out a wave of blood. Thar\u0027Kaan roars, and leaps forward, catching Sklain and pinning him to the ground. He skewers Sklain\u0027s power arm with his knives and he drops his sabre.\n\n\n\"You should\u0027ve died fighting with me against the Coalition Humans.

To your right is Emelé-Dante, who shows you what Ashley will look like in about fifty years. Across from you is three identical looking clones who all managed to secure important yet wildly different positions, being a Navy Admiral, a Military General and a Minister of Foreign Policy. Finally, there\u0027s a short, squat clone who\u0027s hairier than Commissar Mast.\n\n\n\"So, General.

The town looks like a bastardization of the wildness and overpopulation of New York. You see various people doing their business, many sharing faces but none looking alike due to a variety of tattoos, hairstyles, died hair, jewelerry and articles of clothing that range from Cowboy Hats to Top Hats to combat armor. A group of six Clones, all with heads shaved and dyed various colours all wearing combat armor with various pieces of jewellery approach you. The first says something into her radio, and walks up to you.\n\n\n“General Achilles. Come with me, I’ll show you the First Citizen.”\n\n\nYou follow the squad as they escort you through various side streets and buildings towards the Central “Government” building, the word “government” being used very loosely in this anarchist madhouse. As you walk, you’re given your first view of the city. Extravagant houses with automated turrets stand proudly next to miserable concrete slabs filled with clones in various stages of drug addiction. You pass a bar where people are getting high on ship fuel, and three separate open brawls in the street. Finally, you come across a large building, covered in what are either political symbols or juvenile graffiti.\n\n\n“Inside, General.” One of the Escorts says, and you enter the building.\n\n\nYou’re quickly led through winding hallways and up spiraling staircases to a small office. Inside sits an elderly man who looks like a pensioner whose mid-life crisis never ended, First Citizen Alpha. His white hair is streaked with green, his face is studded with bits of metal and he wears a brown suit. A half empty bottle of vodka sits in front of him.\n\n\nYou extend a hand, which he simply stares at. You shrug it off, and take a seat.\n\n\n\"General Achilles. How goes life in the Coalition? Destroying freedom and liberty as I remember?\" He asks.\n\n\n\"Well, there\u0027s this little thing called the Chykri who will wipe out all life if we don\u0027t stop them.

You hit a second in it\u0027s robotic legs, sending it headfirst to the ground. As you reload, you hear a scream.

The Thar\u0027Raan, or Great Drill, has been upgraded and improved by Probiscan and Brain Bug Engineers. The Thar\u0027Raan is a small cylinder that can hold six normal-sized passengers, and has a drill mounted on the front, with a mining laser coming out of the tip. The Thar\u0027Raan is designed for being fired into the Chykri vessel and drilling it\u0027s way though the ship to cause as much damage as possible, while deploying it\u0027s passengers, though they can only be used once.\n\n\nThe Aries Boarding Ship is a boarding ship based on human design. It\u0027s a large rectangle with a powerful engine and a pair of small laser cutters on the front, that can hold over a dozen passengers. The ship is designed for landing onto the Chykri vessel, cutting it\u0027s way through the ship walls to deploy it\u0027s passengers, and returning to the allied vessel to repeat this process. \n\n\nWhich vessel would you like to begin producing?\n","page 451":"The next act is the Alliance Remilitarization Act, which involves using the Alliance military\u0027s extensive military formations, planning and various schemes to reinstate what is, in everything but name, the Alliance military, under Coalition control.

Any other suggestions?\"\n\n\n\"The bases are supplied enough. Supplying them any further would simply involve a wasting of resources. We can get the soldiers to start hunting the mountainous beasts and cave critters for food, and increase their use of melee weapons to save ammo.\" Thar\u0027Kaan says.\n\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\nCabana raises a hand.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027ve got an idea.\"\n\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s a massive supply system that we could start exploiting. The Moogli Smugglers that inhabit the area could be paid to begin supplying the base, the pirates in the system could be convinced to begin giving arms to the soldiers, there\u0027s Garavan tribes that could be convinced. There\u0027s a hell of a lot of criminals we could take advantage of to reinforce the bases.\" Cabana says.\n\n\n\"This is starting to sound like the best option.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s a catch.\" Cabana says. \"This would require supporting a smugglers, pirates, criminals, raiders and in many cases, slavers. This would quickly spread the growth of criminals in the areas and although it wouldn\u0027t have any issues now, it\u0027ll be a serious issue to deal with once the Chykri are dead and gone, but that won\u0027t be until the Chykri are gone and we\u0027re dead or retired.\"\n\n\nYou take a deep breath and think. You have three valid options, and all you know is that the Spine needs to be dealt with.\n","page 331":"Now you need to decide on what models of ships would be used for the fleet. The first model to be decided on is the Boarding Ships. There\u0027s two different models to chose from: The Thar\u0027Raan and the Aries Boarding Ship.\n\n\nThe Thar\u0027Raan is a boarding ship based on Garavan design, which was based on the designs of the Rak\u0027Ghail, an ancient and now extinct alien species. The Thar\u0027Raan, or Great Drill, has been upgraded and improved by Probiscan and Brain Bug Engineers. The Thar\u0027Raan is a small cylinder that can hold six normal-sized passengers, and has a drill mounted on the front, with a mining laser coming out of the tip. The Thar\u0027Raan is designed for being fired into the Chykri vessel and drilling it\u0027s way though the ship to cause as much damage as possible, while deploying it\u0027s passengers, though they can only be used once.\n\n\nThe Aries Boarding Ship is a boarding ship based on human design. It\u0027s a large rectangle with a powerful engine and a pair of small laser cutters on the front, that can hold over a dozen passengers. The ship is designed for landing onto the Chykri vessel, cutting it\u0027s way through the ship walls to deploy it\u0027s passengers, and returning to the allied vessel to repeat this process. \n\n\nWhich vessel would you like to begin producing?\n","page 452":"The next act is the Alliance Remilitarization Act, which involves using the Alliance military\u0027s extensive military formations, planning and various schemes to reinstate what is, in everything but name, the Alliance military, under Coalition control.

The military bases are able to survive with the resources from taxation.
