  "Play as Achilles, the leader of the new Coalition of humans, aliens and machines, to combat a new threat: The Chykri. Attempt to keep the Coalition together and fight not only to win, but to survive.\nThis is a sequel to our previous game, Achilles. We hope you enjoy it. Please rate and comment. Unless you don\u0027t like it, in which case just grumble to yourself about how this one isn\u0027t as good as the first. Thanks.\nEDIT: Had to do some light work. Changed it so surrendering to Chykri grants alternative final chapter instead of sending back to start, checked grammar, changed a few more mistakes. Please message me or Steve if you find any bugs."
