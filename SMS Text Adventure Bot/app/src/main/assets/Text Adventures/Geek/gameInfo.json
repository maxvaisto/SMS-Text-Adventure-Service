  "Carnivals aren\u0027t all fun and games.\nAdditional Notes:\nWhile there is only one spot that contains extra histories for this story, it\u0027s basically the background information of all the major characters and factions. It\u0027s strongly recommended that these are read due to the fact that your character will be interacting with most of these folks in his attempts to successfully accomplish his task(s).\nThis story has a very factional feel to it, so choose your allegiances carefully to get one of the better endings."
