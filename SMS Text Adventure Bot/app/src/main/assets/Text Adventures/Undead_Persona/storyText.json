  "page 123": "Indeed, you stand in the cold more stalwart than you\u0027ve ever been, an entire outlook changed. While the Church may have its faults, blaming it for the world\u0027s destruction isn\u0027t true. It all boils down to the Professor and his deviants, like myself. Unless they wish to repent, then they have no stake in this world.\n\nSuddenly, you begin to hear an odd sort of chant or jingle being sung  from behind you. You turn your head to find at least fifty armored Zealots in formation, marching along with their flashing chests and a surprisingly optimistic attitude, as described by their songs. \"Soldier, what are you doing out here so early? What\u0027s your name and rank?\"\n\nCrap, I just got called out, \"Err, Father Tomas knows. Where is he? I thought he was, uh, coming.\"\n\n\"Nope, he\u0027s staying back for morale reasons.\" The person who called for you gets out of the formation, and runs to catch up with you. The man, espeically shown through the armor, is huge-- probably the biggest Zealot you\u0027ve seen thus far. His voice is pretty heavy, but he sounds surprisingly intelligent for one of his size, \"Wait, are you new? You look young...\"\n\n\"You could say that.\"\n\nHe laughs, misunderstanding, \"Right then, I\u0027m Chief. If you need anything just ask young one. This\u0027ll be much easier than you think. We\u0027ll steam-roll the hell out of those Demons with our newly refined weapons.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"All silver, baby. It cost a lot to build, and we\u0027re the only Zealots aside from Karat- you know, they guy who persists to wear white armor,\" Who or what the hell is he talking about? \"Who have this new design. The Father says this stops them from healing, so we have no chance of losing. Don\u0027t be scared, now. I\u0027ll get you a seat in formation, give me a sec.\"\n\nYour stupid grin at the kindness of the head-Zealot is thankfully concealed by your helmet. He stuffs you in his position-- the front line, while he leads out in front. Just as well, you think, I don\u0027t think this will be as easy as he says, so my being in the front should help. I think.\n\nAnd this begins you ascent into God\u0027s plan, whatever it may be.\n\nThe march is treacherously long, and if you\u0027re admitting to that then you can\u0027t imagine how the others are with all the heavy armor. Thankfully, the curse comes with its blessings, and those blessings are obviously a reason why God\u0027s plan for you involved this. That, or we\u0027re all doomed. You shove that thought away for the moment, though.\n\nEventually, you reach the end of of the journey, and you find nothing but more desert. \"Uh, Chief? Where is the Wolf hideout?\"\n\n\"Literally, underground.\" He laughs. He takes out his rifle and screws off the tusk, and from his armor he withdraws a crafty little shovel-head. \"Samuel, Zadok, do the same. We need to open this up quickly.\"\n\nTwo of the larger Zealots come up from behind you to help shovel the certain mound of sand, and while you find it  amusing at first, it soon becomes apparent that this is the place when you hear a metal clanging sound.\n\n\"This is it!\"\n\nYou look into the ditch, and find an odd metal disk embedded into a round concrete tube, large in diameter. Maybe a well?\n\nTe man labeled \u0027Zadok\u0027 changes his rifle\u0027s end again, back to the tusks, then hollers for everybody to get back. Everybody complies.\n\nWith a large grunt, he prepares his rifle to shoot at the plate, then a large sonic-boom erupts, and the green lightning sets the plate to turn red, in heat. Samuel sends a heavy kick, which is just enough to send the disk out of its place, opening up the well.\n\n\"For God\u0027s glory!\" Chief yells, and they repeat after him with enthusiasm.\n\n\"FOR GOD\u0027S GLORY!\"\n\nThe big-three Zealots jump in one after each-other, and after that it\u0027s a beeline to get into the concrete sewer below. Finally, when it\u0027s your turn, you manage to find foot-holds to climb down, rather than just jumping down aimlessly and without stealth. Of course, stealth is thrown out of the window whenever these lovable tools are in the equation. They\u0027re still chanting, and the light from their armor is the only thing lighting up the cavern!\n\nYour squadron of fifty or more begins a march through it, still as loud and boisterous as ever. But, suddenly, the mood changes. Something\u0027s not right...  Where are the Wolves?\n\nSlowly, as the Zealots move inside the maze of hell, you notice more and more of them disappearing. \"Chief! We\u0027re losing men as we speak!\"\n\nThe Chief looks around, his armor working as  a flashlight, \"Huh? But I don\u0027t see any of the Wolves?\"\n\nMore and more Zealots disappear, with barely anything but a gasp at best. What the hell is happening?\n\nAfter a small while of Zealots pleading for the Chief to turn back, you get the horrible feeling that you\u0027re next...\n\n\n\"Nobody touches my Creations.\"\n\n\nYou have been killed by an unknown player...\n",
  "page 244": "Zadok lets out a hearty laugh, \"Go for it, man.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" You exclaim, nervously laughing along, \"I didn\u0027t really mean it that way, hahaha.\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" He replies, getting up from a chair near your bed, \"I think it\u0027d be healthy, for her at least. Pretty sure she likes you too, nameless man.\"\n\n\"What makes you say that?\" You ask, accidentally rolling off the bed and onto the floor- but as your head reaches the floor your off-hand catches your body, allowing you to lithely flip upright.\n\nZadok watches with a smirk, \"If I had a guess it\u0027s because you\u0027re so mysterious. I think that\u0027s what she\u0027s into-- not really sure, honestly. But you seem like a good guy, so I\u0027m fine with it, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about.\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what\u0027s happening, Zadok. But it\u0027s nice to have the support, I guess.\"\n\n\"You bet.\" The Zealot stretches his beefy arm across his chest before nearing the door. Before exiting the room, he gives a sideward glance at you-- for reasons you aren\u0027t sure of. Taking a deep breath, you glance around your room once more, taking several moments just to make sense of a clock. It\u0027s 3:35am-- no wonder Alice isn\u0027t awake. Zadok has to wake up pretty damn early then, huh.\n\nYou spend a good few minutes stretching and moving around the house, unsure what to do. You take a seat by your bed, straining your memory before attempting to meditate again.\n\n\n\nYou take a look outside-- still dark out. Would it be safe to take a small walk outside before Alice comes back?\n",
  "page 122": "You remain compliant, for now. You think about everything you\u0027ve been through so far-- not much, though it\u0027s felt like a lot. The main \u0027highlights\u0027 was Kelso, where the hell is that bastard? and the constant torment you\u0027ve endured from Father Tomas. At least, regardless of today\u0027s outcome, you\u0027ll have you revenge against the Church, at least.\n\nYou turn your head to find at least fifty armored Zealots in formation, marching along with their flashing chests and a surprisingly optimistic attitude, as described by their songs. \"Soldier, what are you doing out here so early?

He stuffs you in his position-- the front line, while he leads out in front. Just as well, you think, I don\u0027t think this will be as easy as he says, so my being in the front should help. I think.\n\nThe march is treacherously long, and if you\u0027re admitting to that then you can\u0027t imagine how the Zealots are with all the excess armor. Thankfully, your so-called curse comes with its blessings, and if you were to add it all up, you\u0027d probably count the curses in the blessing pile. Everything would be good if only the damn Church wasn\u0027t involved.\n\nEventually, you reach the end of of the journey, and you find nothing but more desert. \"Uh, Chief? Where is the Wolf hideout?\"\n\n\"Literally, underground.\" He laughs. He takes out his rifle and screws off the tusk, and from his armor he withdraws a crafty little shovel-head. \"Samuel, Zadok, do the same.

Slowly, you wait your turn to follow the first half down the well, but as your turn is right about to come up, you grab the man in front of you, and turn him over and drop-- having him fall head-first into the concrete below. The other Zealots stop their chanting and look at you, confused.\n\nYou take advantage of their shock by ramming the silver tusks of your rifle through the man behind you, and following through the bum rush, pushing over several more people. You let leave of your gun,  and begin angrily clawing and punching any Zealot in your way, easily piercing their various armors. Occasionally, a larger one would manage to grab you during your rampage, but the built-up rage inside of you gives you the ability to flip them from over you, then continue your massacre. The state of chaos and cluttered set of armors running frantically around, trying to hit you with their weapons make it all the better, until, from what you can make out with blurred eyesight, comes back up from well, only to blast you with his rifle.\n\nWhat happens after that, you cannot tell.\n\n\nYou have been killed by Zealots... But at least you took out about half of them with you!\n",
  "page 243": "Zadok grins, \"Not a bad choice. Don\u0027t piss anybody off in there though-- you don\u0027t look like you can handle a fight.\"\n\n\"You\u0027d be surprised.\" You reply with a grin of your own. Getting into a fight probably isn\u0027t the best idea though, even if I\u0027m impregnable to blunt objects. Mostly.\n\n\"Well, it\u0027s open early in the mornings, at least. So you can head over there now, if you want. It\u0027s a small building by the south side of the City, got a big sign saying, \u0027Zaloon\u0027 and everything.\"\n\n\"Think you can lead me there?\"\n\n\"Err, yeah, sure man.\" He answers, rubbing at his chin. \"It\u0027s not exactly on the way, but I can at least give you some better dire\n",
  "page 125": "\"So you think the only feasible plan would be to divert there attention for the moment?\" You frown, uncertain. The other option wouldn\u0027t make too much sense, considering that you fought with the Zealot army not too long ago, but this plan seems... distasteful, unattractive. You\u0027re betraying your brethren for those who believe you to be nothing more than a monster, people who believe that anything you do is without reason; good or bad, all mindless mistakes carried out by the Devil himself.\n\nIt\u0027s a scary thought to you-- people believe that about Gideon and me. While I\u0027m not squeaky clean by any means, at least Gideon is willing to throw away everything just to save them!\n\nGideon begins to shuffle towards the hatch, \"Come on, Vampire. We need to get the message out any way we can.\"\n\n\"Well, we still have a Walkie-Talkie that\u0027s probably useable.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you, and his eyes widen, \"What? We do?\"\n\n\"Y-yeah...\" You reply, beginning to scavenge through the various in nicknacks the Wolves kept, and finding David\u0027s transceiver under the mess. \"Nigh certain it still works, too.\"\n\nHe throws his hands up in return, \"Then let\u0027s do that, genius.\" You grasp the radio firmly in your hand and get a vague feeling déjà vu as you once again dial it to the Zealot-channel. Click. It\u0027s on, sounding out static. You interrupt it with an additional button push when Gideon swiftly grabs it out of your hands. \"What the hell, man!\"\n\n\"I\u0027m doing this.\" Gideon states, still pushing the button. \"Zealots, do you hear this?\"\n\nThe cool, female voice is back, \"Err, hello?\"\n\n\"This is Wolf-leader Gideon, Ma\u0027am. I need you to call off the Zealots attacking our base, for your own sake.\"\n\n\"Um, we don\u0027t negotiate with evil, sir.\"\n\n\"No! God damnit Ma\u0027am, I\u0027m warning you because there are only two of us left in the hideout, the rest are on their way to attack your City right now!\"\n\nA pause. \"We will look into it, then. Thank you for notifying us, whatever you are.\" You aren\u0027t able to identify her tone that well, but you hope it isn\u0027t sarcasm. Either way, she doesn\u0027t respond to Gideon\u0027s next reply, \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe two of you sit down on a broken couch, unsure how to proceed further. \"So, if they still raid our stronghold, it\u0027s over for us?\"\n\n\"... Yeah. The way I see it, the best case scenario is that all the Wolves are wiped out by the C.E. Strike Force on the way. I just hope they find Ragnor and the rest after they get us.\"\n\n\"And you\u0027re okay with this?\" You shout, baffled by this still.\n\nHe doesn\u0027t answer.\n",
  "page 246": "Wearing little more than a t-shirt, slacks, and worn-out boots, you head outside of the house. Immediately you are able to witness the gloom that ius the City. Gray buildings nearly identical to the one you reside in except for size. Neon lights paint the sides of every street and needlessly label buildings\n",
  "page 127": "\"We prepare by meeting them at the bottom of the well, like good hosts,\" you reply with a laugh, \"If they kill us then they kill us, if they don\u0027t then we have a chance at surviving.\"\n\nGideon sighs, \"You think they\u0027ll be able to stop Ragnor and his men, at least?\"\n\n\"The Zealot name, \u0027Chief\u0027 seemed confident, but I doubt it. In Wolf-form, the Wolves can easily rip apart anyone in seconds, regardless of armor. Unless they send more than half of their troops all the way back to fortify the city then they have an issue.\"\n\n\"Let\u0027s hope they do.\" Gideon says with a frown. Well, you can go hope by yourself, Gideon. I\u0027m hoping we both survive this ordeal.\n\nThe two of you wait for a while, unsure how to proceed. Eventually, you both head down the hatch and into the concrete cavern that is under the well. You make your way past the claw-scratches and to the end, where you notice Ragnor thoughtfully closed the plate from on top, instead of leaving it open.\n\n\"This is it, Gideon. Our moment of truth.\" You begin to say, trying to start a conversation.\n\nThe hunchback just nods in return, staring upwards to the closed opening, waiting.\n\nMany minutes pass-by, and when something like an hour passes you wonder whether they abandoned raiding the base at all. You idly stand, shaking in place.\n\nSand slowly begins to pour out of the holes  the plate, the the miniscule dots sprinkling on top of both you and Gideon. Soon, a vague blue light begins to peek in, and you know that the Zealots are here.\n\nYou hear a crackling thud, and soon the plate is kicked over and you notice several flashing figures hunching over the well.\n\n\"You there, below. You are, \u0027Vamp\u0027?\"\n\n\"One and the same.\" You call back, \"The man beside me is Gideon. You wish to come inside?\"\n\nYou see some finger pointing from the three men surrounding the well, and one extremely built character jumps from the top of the well, using his armor as a brake by trying to grab onto the surrounding wall. You laugh inside, realizing that he obviously didn\u0027t notice the ledges on the other side of the cylindrical opening.\n\nThe man takes off his helmet, and what you see surprising you, though you;re not sure why. \"I am the Chief.\" The dark-skinned individual introduces himself, bowing slightly. \"I have brought exactly 32 men here, and the rest to find and kill the Demons approaching the City. Now, what do you want, both of you?\"\n\nGideon stares at the man with a wide smile, though he doesn\u0027t speak. You sigh once again, \"We want you to not kill us, to be frank.\"\n\nChief laughs, and calls upwards, \"Samuel, Zadok, come down and meet these two... Gentleman.\"\n\nSoon after he announces it, the two men watching from above the well jump in from behind Chief, crashing into the concrete with a loud crack. The dust settles, and the man continues, \"The two of you don\u0027t seem too bad, but even the Devil can act gracious-- but that\u0027s acting. How can you prove to us that you\u0027re actually willing of redemption? How can I trust you?\"\n\nThe two men behind him near, and although they aren\u0027t quite up to his size, they don\u0027t seem nearly as friendly.\n\n\"Well, for one, we warned you about the other Creations... Wait, how much men did you send to apprehend them?\"\n\n\"Truth.\" He nods, \"30, why?\"\n\nThat\u0027s 13 Creations against 30 mortals; they\u0027ll be slaughtered... You consider how to answer, but Gideon interjects, \"Chief, the Wolves on their way aren\u0027t pushovers.\"\n\n\"And neither are our soldiers.\"\n\n\"No,\" Gideon continues, \"I\u0027ve seen their leader in action. He is merciless and faster than anything you\u0027ve ever seen. Your precious City won\u0027t hold up!\"\n\nFor the first time, Chief seems alarmed, \"Wait... You are the only De-- Creations here?\"\n\n\"Yeah. We have no time to waste, then. If you want our support in saving the city, then we\u0027ll need your promise of being vouched for.\" You state firmly.\n\nChief nods, while the others watch you both, silent. \"You got it. Now let\u0027s get get back, before it\u0027s too late!\"\n\n\"Alright then,\" you say, \"Let\u0027s get out of here while we can.\" To show them the way, you rush ahead, using the ledges to climb. Gideon and the Zealots follow you up, where you find a horde of patient Zealots, waiting for orders.\n\nChief raises his hands and yells, \"RETREAT BACK TO THE CITY, NOW!\"\n\nThe Zealots\u0027 formation quickly changes and you begin your march to the city, hoping you get there in time...\n",
  "page 248": "Zadok almost instantly replies, \"God, obviously.\"\n\nYou hold back your laughter-- though you aren\u0027t sure why you find it amusing, \"No, I mean, how is it governed? Does Tomas, err, Father Tomas just lead everybody and you all listen?\"\n\nThe Zealot doesn\u0027t bother withholding his laughter, \"Of course not! The Father and his disciples deal with the matters of direction; what the people need to stock up on, morale, the like...\"\n\n\"Disciples?\"\n\n\"His disciples were voted in by the citizens-- basically just regular people known to be God-fearing and willing to give their life to studying mysticism and religion with the Father. They\u0027re more or less monks. Anyway, the religion-division works with the Zealot leaders-- Chief, myself, and Karat. Ranking in descending order. Father Tomas actually has more influence than us, since we mostly just keep the peace, collect taxes outlined in the Holy Writings, and hun-- but that\u0027s for a good reason. The Zealots fight for God while the Father leads people to serve God. Him and the disciples discuss laws that are introduced by his weekly sermons, and we make sure they are enforced. Thankfully, there is little crime around here. We realize that Gd is always watching, so even with a small police force that\u0027s usually already divided between tasks and even less ability to find criminals thanks to our limited tech, we get a lot of sharing of necessities between neighbors and practically no murder. The City as it is now is actually pretty young-- I mean, it\u0027s only been what, 7 years since Annihilation? But we get by...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, trying to process everything, \"Annihilation? Demons? What happened?\"\n\n\"Well, immorality and God\u0027s justice. We\u0027re simply paying for the after-affects of meddling with God\u0027s creations and allowing evil to poison our youth.\" Zadok stops facing you to look up at the moon, before adding, \"It was the equivalent of The Flood, but with Fire and brimstone, as prophesied in the Writings.\"\n\nOkay... \"How did the people here survive, then? And, uh, what are the demons left?\"\n\n\"People believing in the Rapture made bunkers way before it happened, saw some flares after the fallout and heard of the only City that missed the explosion. We used to get a lot of refugees, Father Tomas took a lot of us in. But we haven\u0027t had anybody new for years. Reason why you\u0027re such a mystery, eh?\" He ribs you in the side with a weak chuckle, \"But there\u0027s still demons-- the ones that helped bring about this Calamity, that are able to survive under these conditions. Bloodsuckers, shape-shifters, more. That\u0027s what Father Tomas calls them, and I\u0027ve killed the buggers up close. Vile, insane creatures that can plow through an entire battalion of Zealots. Most don\u0027t talk, and the ones that do plead innocence and sentience before they swallow your best friend whole. That\u0027s why hunt them-- unholy freaks of nature, see. They dig burrows in the dirt, trying to hide. But we\u0027re weeding out the ones in the area. In the seven years we\u0027ve been here, Father told us not to leave the premises, but now he\u0027s changed his policies, wants to find other living populations and such. Which is good, this place needed change.\"\n\nYou only nod before taking the conversation elsewhere.\n\n \n",
  "page 126": "Regardless of the fights you\u0027ve had with Zealots in the past month, despite the fact that you have brutally slaughtered dozens of Zealots before tonight, you realize that it is extremely important that now you finally attempt at settling the differences between you and the Church.\n\n\"We\u0027re going to survive this, Gideon. We can do it.\"\n\nHe lazily looks at you, and the yawns, beginning to recline on the broken bench. \"So, you\u0027ve hatched a plan?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" you reply, remembering that David probably left his Walkie-Talkie somewhere... You begin to dive through various clothes and various knickknacks that the Wolves have stored. \"Aha!\"\n\n\"Wuh?\"\n\n\"A Walkie-Talkie. If we can try to reason with the Zealots, don\u0027t you think we can maybe convince them to not kill us?\"\n\nHe gets up, \"You never told me you had one of those!\"\n\nYou nervously scratched at your head, \"I... Kinda forgot about it as well. But it\u0027s great use for now, Gideon.\"\n\nHe waves you off, \"Doesn\u0027t matter, you\u0027ll never reason with them.\"\n\n\"It\u0027s worth a shot,\" you say, crossing your arms defiantly. You unfold your arms and turn on the radio-- then remember that this would be Zealot HQ. Now you just need to fake being a Zealot again and get the station of the incoming horde...\n\nClick\n\nYou push the button in, too anxious to wait for the crackling static, \"Quick, Ma\u0027am, what\u0027s the Zealot\u0027s Combat Channel?\"\n\nIt\u0027s the cool female voice, again, \"Channel 40, why? Who is this?\"\n\nBut you\u0027re already flipping the channels. Now, from 13 to 40...\n\nGideon sits up groggily, and watches you in silence. \"Incoming Zealots!\"\n\nYou release the button, and wait. A heavy, though articulate-sounding voice replies from the other end, \"This is Chief. Who is this?\"\n\n\"Friends. Or, at least, those who want to be. We are the last Creations around, and we want to talk to you.\"\n\n\"What do you wish to speak about, Demons?\"\n\n\"Mostly about your usage of that term. We want peace, nothing else.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"We- we know you\u0027re coming for us and our hideout. But we don\u0027t want to fight.\"\n\nYou wait several moments for him to answer. \"Give me your name first.\"\n\n\"Err, Vamp.\"\n\nGideon chuckles in the background.\n\nThe man named \u0027Chief\u0027 gives a heavy sigh, \"Right. And how do you want your meeting to be set up?\"\n\n\"Any sort of meeting that doesn\u0027t include me being shot or speared by your guns sounds good.\"\n\n\"Funny. If you actually wish to do this then I\u0027d wait outside for us to come.\"\n\n\"I... Think you misunderstand.\" You reply, rather certain about Chief\u0027s false attempt to mislead you, \"Trying to kill us will not work out well for you. There are other Creations, actual evil ones that are heading for your city right now. If you don\u0027t stop them then you\u0027re city will be lost.\"\n\nStatic for a while. \"Why do you not tell me this sooner?\"\n\n\"... Do you even believe me?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he says, \"We may send scout teams to check. But for now I\u0027m interested in what you want to speak about. Are you a man of your word?\"\n\n\"I try.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\" Chief pauses, his low-voice ending awkwardly, \"Give us ten minutes.\"\n\nWhile you wait for him, Gideon just laughs, \"I swear, vamp, if you pull this off then I swear...\" He gets up with a wry smile.\n\n\"Let\u0027s just hope their scouts get good information.\" You reply, ironically trying to be as optimistic as possible. The chances are slim, but you think this could work out with your unlife intact.\n\nTime passes, and while you didn\u0027t count how much you still worry that they may have ditched messaging and are just continuing their march to this area.\n\n\"Vamp, are you still there?\"\n\nYou get out of your day-dream and push the button back to reply, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"It... Seems you\u0027re right that at there are a band of unknown beings several miles behind us. But this doesn\u0027t mean as much as you would hope.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"How many of you are there in all?

  "page 129": "Seeing your stunned silence, Gideon just closes his eyes, \"Best get comfortable then. They\u0027ll find the hiding place soon, don\u0027t you worry.\"\n\nHopeless, you take a seat beside Gideon, and wait. Minutes turn to hours as you wait. After a long while, you hear footsteps approaching.\n\n\"They\u0027re here.\" You whisper to Gideon, who is unresponsive.\n\nSuddenly, a small ball is tossed from the hatch, and it rolls near your feet. The last thing you feel is heat, the last thing you see is a mixture of fire and shrapnel, and the last thing you hear is the heavy grunts of Churchmen and the crackling of flames.\n\nDeath was actually quicker than you expected.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 128": "With amazing agility, you turn around to send a powerful roundhouse kick to Gideon, making powerful impact-- just enough to have him on the floor, but not hurt too bad. Meanwhile, you grab the fallen transceiver and angrily scold him, \"What is the hell is matter with you, Gideon?\"\n\nHe doesn\u0027t respond, though he sits cross-legged on the floor, staring at the floor as a child would. You sigh, and try your own plan at survival.\n\nClick\n\nYou push the button in, too anxious to wait for the crackling static, \"Quick, Ma\u0027am, what\u0027s the Zealot\u0027s Combat Channel?\"\n\nIt\u0027s the cool female voice, again, \"Channel 40, why? Who is this?\"\n\nBut you\u0027re already flipping the channels. Now, from 13 to 40...\n\nGideon sits up groggily, and watches you in silence.\n\n\"Incoming Zealots!\" You announce, then release the button, and wait.\n\nA heavy, though articulate-sounding voice replies from the other end, \"This is Chief. Who is this?\"\n\n\"Friends. Or, at least, those who want to be. We are the last Creations around, and we want to talk to you.\"\n\n\"What do you wish to speak about, Demons?\"\n\n\"Mostly about your usage of that term. We want peace, nothing else.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"We- we know you\u0027re coming for us and our hideout. But we don\u0027t want to fight.\"\n\nYou wait several moments for him to answer. \"Give me your name first.\"\n\n\"Err, Vamp.\"\n\nGideon chuckles nervously in the background.\n\nThe man named \u0027Chief\u0027 gives a heavy sigh, \"Right. And how do you want your meeting to be set up?\"\n\n\"Any sort of meeting that doesn\u0027t include me being shot or speared by your guns sounds good.\"\n\n\"Funny. If you actually wish to do this then I\u0027d wait outside for us to come.\"\n\n\"I... Think you misunderstand.\" You reply, rather certain about Chief\u0027s false attempt to mislead you, \"Trying to kill us will not work out well for you. There are other Creations, actual evil ones that are heading for your city right now. If you don\u0027t stop them then you\u0027re city will be lost.\"\n\nStatic for a while. \"Why do you not tell me this sooner?\"\n\n\"... Do you even believe me?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he says, \"We may send scout teams to check. But for now I\u0027m interested in what you want to speak about. Are you a man of your word?\"\n\n\"I try.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\" Chief pauses, his low-voice ending awkwardly, \"Give us ten minutes.\"\n\nWhile you wait for him, Gideon just laughs, \"I swear, vamp, if you pull this off then I swear...\" He gets up with a wry smile.\n\n\"Let\u0027s just hope their scouts get good information.\" You reply, ironically trying to be as optimistic as possible. The chances are slim, but you think this could work out with your unlife intact.\n\nTime passes, and while you didn\u0027t count how much you still worry that they may have ditched messaging and are just continuing their march to this area.\n\n\"Vamp, are you still there?\"\n\nYou get out of your day-dream and push the button back to reply, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"It... Seems you\u0027re right that at there are a band of unknown beings several miles behind us. But this doesn\u0027t mean as much as you would hope.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"How many of you are there in all?

The cursed Creator wishes that we destroy our brothers in battle so he reaps the reward when it\u0027s over.” Gideon tilts his head back and continues forward, “I\u0027d keep this in mind, vampy. I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re here, whether to warn us or to do devil\u0027s bidding, but I trust you enough to see you have no idea what\u0027s going on, so I\u0027ll be giving you the chance to give a little presentation for the guys here.

You catch up to where he is, noticing what he\u0027s looking at: an opening, light.\n\n“That\u0027s our hideout.” The Wolf jumps up, grabbing onto some sort of ledge to bring his deformed body up. You watch his body struggle up it, land on solid ground (and then a lot of murmuring from above), then jump up yourself, making it up with ease.\n\nThe hideout is surprisingly low-key for the most powerful beings on the planet, but considering how they\u0027re just trying to survive a dimly lit room filled with sleeping bags and animal-carcasses strewn about is to be expected.

  "page 79": "Better not freak them out. Can\u0027t have them overreact or something.\n\nYou nod to Gideon, who seems to be acting commander of the Wolves. They gather around you, staring with glossy eyes and gaping mouths. \"Right,\" you announce, clapping your gauntleted hands together, \"I am a fellow Creation, like, uh, you guys. And gals!\" You add in quickly before pausing, \"While I am the only Vampire left, I am a Creation just like you. I have been fighting the Church since I escaped from Facility 13-- the last one. As I understand it, the Church has been trying to kill us, even after the Professor is out of the picture.\"\n\nNothing but silence from your audience as of yet.\n\n\"Um, so after escaping the Facility, myself and a... A friend,\" It didn\u0027t sound like Kelso\u0027s on good terms with the Wolves, he probably knew Gideon from way back when, \"we trained in the sand-dunes, and went out to find the only Creations left. While trying to find you, the Wolves, we had to fight the Zealots, who were more than happy to send their troops at us. As you all are powerful Creations, I will leave it up to you to realize how easy it was to defeat them. But, I kept one as a ghoul, and he had something very interesting to say about you all.\" You look to David, who nods back.\n\n\"The Church has found out where your stockade is, and will send all their troops to finish the Creations here within a week.\" David says, blank-faced. Murmuring spreads throughout the encampment, and you can see several nodding their heads. Others seem more reluctant to believe it.\n\n\"So what do you want us to do with your information?\" One asks.\n\n\"Well, there are multiple options. One; we can defend it, and train for when they attack. Two; we can go on the offensive and just attack the city, taking them by surprise. Or three; stay settled cozy here and get slaughtered by superstitious assholes. Up to you guys.\"\n\n\"Can\u0027t we also flee?\" Another question, obviously there\u0027s a split in the group; some seem to be especially vengeful against the Church, others just want to be left alone. But everyone here wants to survive, you\u0027re certain of that.\n\n\"Possibly, though I doubt the Church wouldn\u0027t pursue you through the desert.\n\n\"... Why should we trust you?\"\n\nYou consider the question for a moment, and realize that although you aren\u0027t lying, they have the right to be paranoid, \"Because David was one of the Zealots, and he\u0027s just relaying what he knows. Heck, how do you think I found your hiding place? The Zealots know, and are getting ready to destroy everyone here. They believe us to be hellish creatures bound to Earth, and think that it\u0027s there obligation to banish us back to where we came from.\"\n\nMostly done, you watch everyone surrounding you. Gideon remains stroking at his scruffy chin, and the rest are just... Thinking.\n\nSuddenly, the cloaked Ragnor makes a return, jumping up from the hatch. \"So, what\u0027d I miss?\" He asks with a chuckle, taking his ruby-red hood off. Ragnor is a balding adult, probably middle-aged before he was reCreated. He\u0027s muscular, but not in the way Gideon is; he\u0027s extremely tall; lean and built.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" Gideon answers, \"It basically boils down to whether we defend, attack, or not believe Vampy and the Ghoul over here.\" With a sigh, he looks scans everyone in the room, \"So, shall we put it to vote?\"\n\nOne of the younger wolves respond, \"I believe the vampire. I don\u0027t see why he\u0027d lie, and... The Church does plan to hurt us, no matter what colored lenses we put on. We are evil to them, aren\u0027t we?\"\n\nGideon cracks his neck, waits for any other response (there isn\u0027t), and then turns to you, \"Well, it seems like you can decide for us. If you want my advice, I thinking attacking the entire city is a bit drastic, though defending well would get what\u0027s needed done: Survival.\"\n\nRagnor glares at you as well, boldly standing parallel to the leader, \"But going on the offensive will give us an advantage, for once. We just need to take the assault the City while the are on their way to our hideout. It\u0027d be perfect timing to gain control of the city!\"\n",
  "page 78": "It\u0027s time to get these sleepy assholes up and running.\n\nYou nod to the crowd as they gather around you, staring with glossy eyes and gaping mouths. \"I\u0027m not going to sugarcoat anything,\" you snarl, starting off with a very loud, though clear voice, \"The Church has plans to raid our little stronghold here by next week.\"\n\nGasps from the Wolves, and men exit their bags. Seems to have worked, for now.\n\n\"And while that may be hard to believe, I\u0027m sure we all know how ruthless the Zealots are. I escaped from the last Facility-- Facility 13, soon before it came tumbling down with C.E. Troopers, who burned down the laboratory. Since then, I have fought many of them, some purposely in order to find my brethren here, to join you as well as to warn you of the incoming second apocalypse. We are blessed Creations, gifted in our own right. We aren\u0027t innately evil, like the Church believes. Rather, we are capable of great things, but only if we survive our genocide.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want us to do?\" One of them shouts out, interrupting you.\n\n\"I want you to fight back, and prepare for when they come next week. We need to take the initiative; I know how powerful Creations can be, so I have no doubt in my mind that we can beat them. But only if we get ready.\"\n\n\"Why should we trust you?\" One of the younger ones ask.\n\nYou bare your teeth; fear is a big factor of your speech, \"Because if I\u0027m right then we all die.\" You seethe out, staring intently at your brethren. \"We have three options the way I see it; defend the stronghold and prepare for when they come; try to take control of the city with our combined strengths before the attack; or just get slaughtered when the time comes.\"\n\nMost of the Wolves continue gaping, though Gideon cracks his knuckles.\n\n\"Nice speech, Vampire\" A voice declares, and the red-cloaked figure pops out of the hatch. Ragnor\u0027s hood fall down, and the profile is of a middle-aged, balding man. Terribly tall, and lean; powerful and domineering. \"Do you really think we can overtake the Church?\"\n\n\"If we do it carefully, yes.\"\n\nHe smiles, \"Then I like what I\u0027m hearing; I\u0027m in.\" While it\u0027s amusing how enthusiastic he is, it also seems to win over more of the Wolves. Perhaps Ragnor is a big figure in the Wolf Underground. \"It is likely to work, too. While some of us are inexperienced, we can easily beat them while their forces are divided into attacking our stronghold. We just need to be clever.\"\n\nGideon continues to grimly frown, \"I think the \u0027hold the fort\u0027 idea will work better. It\u0027s safer, and more suited to our abilities.\"\n\n\nIt\u0027s odd, but you feel like it\u0027s completely your decision. Maybe they just really trust in you?\n",
  "page 71": "Your mentor, the Ghoul, and yourself make your way through the remnants of the past world. Suddenly, it all makes sense to you. The world went to hell, and it was the Professor\u0027s abuse of his Creations that furthered it. Now, the Church hunts you all down for no reason other than to to give hope to \u0027real\u0027 humans. It\u0027s despicable, but it\u0027s the world you\u0027re in right now.\n\nThe hot sun beats down upon you, while your slave suddenly comes to a halt. \"This is it.\" He blandly calls out, reaching down to the sandy flooring, and makes hand motions as to move some of the sand away.\n\nYou turn to wish your master a farewell, but he is already gone. Only a hazy version of him can be seen through squinting in the distance. So, it\u0027s just me and my Ghoul. Let\u0027s just hope it doesn\u0027t get bloody...\n\nYou follow David\u0027s beckoning, and bend down to see what he was unclearing. As your slave digs, more and more sand  seems to pile in. \"What are we looking for?\"\n\n\"They\u0027re underground, sir.\"\n\nWith a nod, you decide to help out with the digging. As you lay your hands on the sand, you thank fortune that you hadn\u0027t done this in the middle of the day, rather than just an hour or so after sun-rise. The sand would no doubt have burnt your fingers otherwise! Even though you and your ghoul are digging barehanded, it doesn\u0027t take too much time before you begin to feel the sand getting thicker, more doughy. With quick powerful stroke, you continue ripping through the sand, throwing it out of your radius, soon creating a little pit, low enough that you could stand up in it. After clawing at the earth with your servant for a while, you accidentally scratch at something... Hard, metallic. Underneath the sand lay a metal disk, with evenly-spaced holes around it\u0027s edge and the middle. Even as it is right now, it\u0027s fairly obvious that the disk is heavily embedded into the ground, and prying it out would no doubt prove to be a challenge. At first, you try just digging around and under it, but your efforts seemed to have been in vain; the plate appeared to be a part of both the earth and some sort of brick-well that goes much further down.\n\n\"You sure this is the place? You ask, making sure that this was the opening to the Wolf Stronghold. It\u0027d make sense, as this is extremely safe from the Zealots, considering.\n\n\"Yes.\" Comes the monotone reply, \"The few remaining GPS satellites pin-pointed this exact spot. We caught several monsters disappearing from under the sand here.\"\n\n\nNow, how should we try to open this?\n",
  "page 70": "Kelso sighs, \"Too true. It is about time I fill you in on the details, even if they\u0027re hard, even for me, to recall. It was a spread of about two decades. Surprisingly small for the whole world to collapse, but when shit hits the fan it has to either be cleaned or it\u0027ll spew out everywhere,\" he chuckles, motioning the Ghoul to continue the walk toward the Wolves. The story will probably take a while... You begin reanointing your sun-tan lotion while your mentor explains what happened.\n\n\"Years before you awoke, the world was in complete order. Governments were somewhat conciliatory with each other, and liberty and justice was preserved. It didn\u0027t take too long before the peace was endangered, the militant Religious-- like the Zealots,\" he shoots your Ghoul a glance, \"began rioting, terrorizing less fortunate countries and gaining power there. While the governments were large and powerful, they were inexcusably... lazy when all this happened. Soon, this spread to the more developed places on Earth, like this continent. For a little while, these religions were corner-stones of society, but this weakened it. People were scared, and fear makes the common man do things they wouldn\u0027t do otherwise. To say the least, the 21st century was not off to a good start. And it slowly, but sneakily, went downhill from there.\n\n\"Amidst all this, the earth was a beautiful, natural place. Ecosystems filled with life and splendor were everywhere. Civilization was at its peak, human beings were able to do wondrous things like fly, and cure almost all illnesses and conditions using scientific means. The methods used, of course, bothered many \u0027men of God\u0027, like your slave. They wanted to stop progress in the name of a deity long dead. After years of struggle, they were quieted to close-knit communities, and had no impact on politics and scientific progress. During this struggle, the terrorists began gaining traction. Even worse, new viruses began infecting parts of the globe, and the irresponsible Governments continued doing nothing, until it was too late. Developed countries or not, many fell ill of the horrible new diseases, and the Old-Zealots started to control more and more land, becoming the dominant force in most places. That\u0027s why the world turned to desert and we\u0027ve already found a lot of remnants of the Old World buried in it; they were pillaged by the hordes of humans, and as the population dwindled, plants weren\u0027t tilled. Soon later, there was drought, and the entire world as we know it has become a giant Dustbowl, just mixed in with disease and raiders. Simon Kurschner became the \u0027man with a plan\u0027 for years during this. He garnered enough support from the local governments with his experiments to get funding, as well as a whole Facility to save the human-race. His science was new, revolutionary even; and while many disapproved of what he was doing, the Professor was recognized as the last hope of humanity.\"\n\n\"What\u0027d he do?\" You ask, with vague memories coming back. Tidbits of information allow you to remember, but not enough...\n\n\"He created me and you. He found a way to create human beings with extraordinary powers, with abilities of legend. His Creations were disposable humans; ones who were going to die regardless. Even though he had no authorization to do so, he began using these dead bodies for his experiments. He gave the dead and dying new life, even with a price. The first experiments he made were immune to disease, and he said he hoped to save the human-race this way. But that wasn\u0027t true, he wished to rule what was left of the human-race with his new super-soldiers. Kurschner sent his Creations to fight the Militants, with each one as powerful as you or myself, ten of them made easy work of five hundred Zealots at a time. His new humans were invincible fighting machines, and all under his control. Similar to ghouls, only a step above that.\n\nRegardless, even after the Militia problem was solved, the Professor began to mass-produce his Creations, each of them ravaging wherever they went, unregulated. Under his command, they annihilated whatever was left of the World Governments, and soon came upon humanity. The bastard trapped us in capsules, letting my friends out just to go on psychotic rampages on the humans opposing the Professor. That\u0027s where the other Zealots, of the Church, come in. Even though they were smaller at the time, they managed to push the Professor back  by exploiting the Creations\u0027 specific weaknesses, and silver. They managed to destroy most of his Facilities, fighting against what they thought, and still think as, the devil. They grew very large as well, and have taken part of what is rebuilding humanity, with religiously-suited technology and a brand new gospel. But absolute power corrupts absolutely, and they ordered their men to kill any Creations left, regardless of malevolent intent. Our Facility, Facility 13, was the last one standing. By then the Professor was on the run, but the New-Zealots were laying waste to any of his work, believing that they should reset the World, like God did in his bible. Fueled on fear-mongering, the only human societies left rely on fighting evil, us, even though they massacre us now, as if it\u0027s open season. But no, they believe we are the Devil\u0027s work, and as such our sentience means nothing to them. So we run, and we fight, but only in self-defense.\n\nNow we\u0027re back in the Dark Ages, all thanks to the Professor, and once again, the Church.\" He kicks at the sand with a frown, but continues marching with you through the beautiful, though dead landscape, reminiscing about the world that was.\n\n\nYou barely speak throughout this, considering all of it.\n",
  "page 73": "\"Move aside, Ghoul.\" You command, grabbing for the huge rifle you looted off of the Zealots you last killed. It truly is an amazing weapon, the bursts of lightning would be extremely affective against anything if caught off-guard. Of course, shooting at a metal lid may not be the most brilliant idea, but it\u0027s much cooler to try out than using your bare hands to pick up the metallic disk. With David the Ghoul backing away to the end of your pit, you aim and fire a blast of lightning at the plate.\n\nYou hear a loud thundering emit from your weapon as you\u0027re flung several feet back from the recoil of this weapon. Through the cloudy smoke you can still make out the the green chain of lightning strike at the plate, creating a large hissing sound.\n\nGreat, now the metal disk covering the well is visibly red hot, glowing a neon color and radiating heat from it. Your Ghoul sighs, though doesn\u0027t speak his thoughts, obviously as to not insult you.\n\n\"Err,\" You stutter, realizing your blunder, \"David,\" (you use his real name this time), \"would you mind trying to kick off the plate? It should be weaker now that it\u0027s almost reached melting point. Maybe.\"\n\nYour ghoul shakes his head. He replies, \"Can we try to use the bayonet\u0027s tusks to pry it open?\"\n\nYou nod awkwardly, and near the searing plate with your rifle. Swiftly, but carefully, you fit the tusks in a slight opening where sand must have been embedded, and use whatever leverage you can to push the lid up. Thankfully, you succeeded in loosening the disk, which means that your rifle manages to carry the lid off of the well. The bad part? Well, the end of your rifle seems to have melted a bit. Perhaps it wasn\u0027t made to deal with anything but short bursts of extreme-heat, rather than a prolonged carrying-session. Still, it could be worse. David has a back-up rifle as well, so little harm done, considering.\n\nAfter patting your Ghoul on the back for the idea, you begin to hear the sounds of running from inside of the well...\n\nYou shrug, and smile at your Ghoul, and then proceed to look down the brick-well...\n\nIt\u0027s dark, for one thing, and the sound of pattering foot-steps on concrete grows louder. Overcome with nervousness, you loudly blurt out, \"We come in peace!\"\n\nSeveral dark figures appear from the bottom of the well, after several glances upwards at you and whispering, one of them waves you down. Shivering, you jump down the well, using the cylindrical bricks surrounding you to position yourself as to not fall on them. Still, you fall with a heavy thud. Yeah, I\u0027m gonna need new sneakers.\n\nUnlike yourself, David just goes down it normally, using the short metal bars protruding one of the sides, climbing downwards. The dark figures eye you carefully, taking a while to speak. One with dark gray hair and scruffy facial hair as well as a slouching hunchback of a surprisingly muscular body, points at your armor, \"If you\u0027re a Zealot, I\u0027d turn back right now. If you don\u0027t, then my friend here, the cloaked one, will happily snap your neck for making such a hideous racket.\"\n\nHis voice isn\u0027t too threatening, but his body language and thick-eyebrows suggest otherwise. He\u0027s clad in tight cloth shirt and pants, bulging with muscles, and is surrounded with an intimidating aura. The other one is completely cloaked, though watches your Ghoul with suspicion. \"I\u0027m not of the Church,\" you start, trying to make a good first impression, \"and neither is he. Not anymore at least.\"\n\n\"Then what are you?\" The gruff man calls out, his eyes narrowing.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027m glad you asked. I\u0027m a... A Creation, just like you. This is my Ghou--\" By the time you uttered the word, \u0027Creation\u0027 he had already put you in a headlock. The cloaked one has already put your ghoul to sleep, though hopefully not forever...\n\nThe man continues, \"What do you want from us, fangs-boy? I thought the rest of your clan died.\"\n\nClans? \"No!\" You exclaim, struggling out of his hold. You actually manage to surprise him with your strength and are able to push him off of you. \"I honestly have no idea what you\u0027re talking about. But you\u0027re part of the Wolves, right? My associate and I want to join your strong hold.\"\n\nAfter stabilizing, he spits back at you, \"We don\u0027t need any joiners.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" You argue, your body tensing. \"The Zealots are planning to raid this place soon, and I figure you could use as much help as possible.\"\n\nThe old man continues growling at you, \"What are you, some sort of message-boy for the Professor?\" Well, at least that means they aren\u0027t working for him. \"The Church means no harm to us at this point. It\u0027d be stupid for them to attack us. If you\u0027re trying to make a powerful group do something out of desperation, then oh boy, have you come to a bad place, vampy. I\u0027d go back to the sun, where the pain is relatively quick.\" He cracks his knuckles. If you weren\u0027t so confident in your abilities, you might have been intimidated by this Neanderthal.\n\n\"Then perhaps you should ask my Ghoul, David. He was a Zealot before I brought him to the darkness.\" You point at the slumped body on the floor.\n\n\"He\u0027s dead now, too late.\" The brute says with a cruel grin, \"Snapped his neck, Ragnor did.\"\n\nYou laugh, \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027d die from that.\" You take several steps toward your slave, waving the cloaked man aside, you grab David by the cuff of his armor and pick him up, then bring your hand to his neck and snap it back.\n\nDavid glumly states, \"Hi.\"\n\nThe Wolf grits his teeth, \"Didn\u0027t know Vampires could use their powers like that.\"\n\n\"Then you\u0027ll be learning a whole lot more during my stay here. What was that you were saying about being the last of my clan?\"\n\nHe smiles back, surprisingly, \"Oh? So you don\u0027t know. You\u0027re the last of the Vampire Creations, as the rest died in this desert planet. I\u0027m surprised you made it this long since the last Facility was destroyed. But if you don\u0027t remember that, then do you even remember your name?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m afraid not. Can you at least tell me yours?\"\n\nThe Wolf laughs, \"Call me Gideon. The cloaked figure on the side is Ragnor, our residential assassin, even if fighting has little place anymore.\" He brings out a hairy, clawed hand to shakes yours.\n\nYou accept it. \"So I\u0027m in?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m still suspicious of your reasons for coming here, and your story about the Zealots needs some checking.\"\n\n\"Is it really that surprising?\"\n\n\"Less that and more that we don\u0027t want to fight them.\" What? Seeing your confused expression, Gideon continues, \"Listen here Vampy, I\u0027d rather die and let humanity survive than not. And most of us here are ready for that. If the Zealots come to our turf then we\u0027ll wipe them out easy, but we\u0027re definitely not going to seek conflict, even if me and the boys can take those choir-boys out in an instant.\"\n\n\"Why not? They want to kill us all?\"\n\nHe shakes his head, his face now grim, \"The Church may believe that we\u0027re demons, but they also value the sanctity of life, so I doubt they\u0027d come here. Regardless, they aren\u0027t all that wrong about us. The things we\u0027ve done... The innocents we\u0027ve massacred in our wake. It doesn\u0027t mean that we\u0027re bad now, per se, but what we\u0027ve done is inexcusable. The World has gone to waste, and I\u0027m alright if we don\u0027t survive to see it rebuild itself.\n\nYou stand in silence for a little while, realizing that you\u0027ve joined ranks with the modern equivalent of the hippies.\n\nGideon grins again, \"But don\u0027t worry about that now, let\u0027s close the lid on top of our well and then introduce you to the rest of the gang.\"\n",
  "page 72": "\"C\u0027mon Slave, you and I together can probably take this out of it\u0027s place.\" As usual, he complies. With a flick of your wrist, you bring out one of your signature claws, and draw your index finger along the bottom edge of the metal plate, taking as much sand out of it as possible. After thousands of sand pellets fall out, you both position yourselves opposite one another, and firmly grasp the end of the disc, clawing in anywhere possible to gain enough leverage to pull it upwards, out of it\u0027s fixed place. David and yourself glance at each other, and meet at the red-eyes.\n\n1, 2, 3!\n\nForming an odd sort of mental connection with your ghoul, you both bring all the strength you can muster to pull the rough, grainy plate out of the stop of the well. As you pull at the disc, you can feel yourself pulling your muscles as well, the first feeling you\u0027ve had of strain for a while. This would be a good thing any other time (sort of), but now it\u0027s just not a good time to go back to human-like limitations. Your ghoul on the other hand, glumly shows little exertion, even though he seems to be attempting to carry out your will. \"David,\" You encourage, using his actual name this time, \"Put your back into it. All your body, we can do this!\"\n\nYou continue trying to pry open the hatch, but it just doesn\u0027t budge... Until a sudden movement. Feeling it shift slightly to the side, your ghoul instinctively follow you there, and you both pull at it in a close space, together. After exerting yourself greatly, you manage to take it out of it\u0027s wedge in a very sudden throw, flinging it out of your own pit with a clatter. You shrug, and smile at your Ghoul, and then proceed to look down the brick-well...\n\nIt\u0027s dark, for one thing, but you can barely make out the sound of feet pattering on cold concrete. Overcome with nervousness, you loudly blurt out, \"We come in peace!\"\n\nSeveral dark figures appear from the bottom of the well, after several glances upwards at you and whispering, one of them waves you down. Shivering, you jump down the well, using the cylindrical bricks surrounding you to position yourself as to not fall on them. Still, you fall with a heavy thud.

  "page 75": "\"Ragnor, use those climbing skills of yours and find a way to seal the top of the well better. Can\u0027t have one of them dust storms filling the place, nor let any traveler find us like these two rugrats.\" Gideon says, waving for you to follow him and his goofy walking pattern. While the cloaked man begins to climb, you and David follow the hunchback though the stronghold of the wolves. It\u0027s a dark tunnel path, but several well-placed torches along the concrete walls give you enough light to make out peculiar drawings on the walls. Not exactly professional artwork or anything, just passionate claw-markings. But still...\n\n“Hey Gideon,” you ask, examining one specifically for it\u0027s graphic nature, “What\u0027s up with the markings?”\n\nThe hunchback turns his head, but continues moving, “The writing? It\u0027s a code language we formed, mixture of all the languages the folks here are familiar with. It\u0027s more or less a system of simplified pictures, but you\u0027ll be able to read it if you stay here long enough.”\n\n“Can you read this one out to me?” You make sure to stop and point it out; the writing here is different than the rest, even more picturesque than the rest. You can\u0027t hope to read it, but you do notice a recurring theme-- a cross and a pentagram. Not only that, but they\u0027re much less refined than the others, as if written with anger.\n\n“That one is rather basic, I think I even went over it before. It basically boils to, eh...” He shuffles closer to you, and brings his large eye to the writing, “Peace is what keeps our humanity, for the Professor, cursed be he, uses strife to tear us apart. The cursed Creator wishes that we destroy our brothers in battle so he reaps the reward when it\u0027s over.” Gideon tilts his head back and continues forward, “I\u0027d keep this in mind, vampy. I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re here, whether to warn us or to do devil\u0027s bidding, but I trust you enough to see you have no idea what\u0027s going on, so I\u0027ll be giving you the chance to give a little presentation for the guys here. By vote, we\u0027ll either agree or not. After that, it\u0027s up to you whether you stay or not. Got it?”\n\n“That\u0027s all I could have asked for, sir.” You reply, hoping you can prepare them for the Church\u0027s onslaught next week. If not, then, well, you and your brothers are done for, regardless of non-violent intentions.\n\nAfter several minutes of treading through the passages of the tunnel, Gideon stops to look up, even if his head doesn\u0027t lift that far. You catch up to where he is, noticing what he\u0027s looking at: an opening, light.\n\n“That\u0027s our hideout.” The Wolf jumps up, grabbing onto some sort of ledge to bring his deformed body up. You watch his body struggle up it, land on solid ground (and then a lot of murmuring from above), then jump up yourself, making it up with ease.\n\nThe hideout is surprisingly low-key for the most powerful beings on the planet, but considering how they\u0027re just trying to survive a dimly lit room filled with sleeping bags and animal-carcasses strewn about is to be expected. The ragtag group that are the Wolves are surprising though; a thin man with dark hair, only to have a visible streak of white in the front; a rather hairy, though otherwise attractive female with dirty blonde hair who\u0027s around your age (early twenties?); several scruffy teenagers; a dark-skinned, mustached, and barrel-chested man; at least three of obvious Asian descent; and, of course, Gideon, pointing you out to everybody.\n\nMost of them getting out of there bags, they begin gawking at you. You wince as the female eye you with interest, while the men seem to just want to know what you want so they could sleep. You motion to Gideon, and you get close to him and ask, \"These are the Wolves? Not as... Impressive, as I thought they\u0027d be.\"\n\n\"You\u0027re not exactly super-hero material either, child. Kinda stock; dark, straight hair and pale skin. Lean physique.\" Noticing you\u0027re confusion he just pokes at your chest, \"What matters is what\u0027s on the inside. That\u0027s where power comes from. Remember that.\" He begins to raise his voice, \"Now, this here is a Vampire. He has no name, so call him whatever you like, but he has some \u0027opinions\u0027 he\u0027d like to share.\n\n\nAs your ghoul struggles up the hatch, you wonder how you want to persuade this group of lazy Wolves to prepare.\n",
  "page 74": "Using divine intuition, you lean in close to the holes on the lid and yell as loudly (and awkwardly) as you can, \"HELLO THERE, WE\u0027RE LOOKING FOR THE WOLVES.\"\n\nYour ghoul snickers. You vaguely hear the echo of your voice trail off into the buried well. Hopefully somebody down there heard your dopey exclamation, even if it came out dumb sounding. You certainly wouldn\u0027t want to go through it again. You hear some heavy foot-steps from the well, and try your best to peer through it. Alas, it is too dark. Still, you hear a voice in response.\n\n\"Who are yeh?\" The voice progressively gets closer. It\u0027s gruff, but calm.\n\n\"Uh, I\u0027m not a hundred-percent sure! But we\u0027re related.\"\n\n\"Related eh? You\u0027d have to explain that one to me.\" You can hear a sharp thud, and the lid on top of the well turn from a flat 180-degrees to a wedged 90. A hairy, clawed hand withdraws. You hear another thump, probably the Wolf down there falling back to the floor.\n\nYou shrug, and smile at your Ghoul, and then proceed to look down the brick-well...\n\nIt\u0027s dark, for one thing, and you can\u0027t make out anything but two figures looking up at you. Overcome with nervousness, you loudly blurt out, \"We come in peace!\"\n\nSeveral dark figures appear from the bottom of the well, after several glances upwards at you and whispering, one of them waves you down. Shivering, you make sure to slowly go down, using the metal foot-holds protruding from the side of the cylindrical, brick well. The dark figures eye you carefully, taking a while to speak. One with dark gray hair and scruffy facial hair as well as a slouching hunchback of a surprisingly muscular body, points at your armor, \"If you\u0027re a Zealot, I\u0027d turn back right now.\"\n\nHis voice isn\u0027t too threatening, but his body language and thick-eyebrows suggest otherwise.

  "page 130": "\"We prepare by meeting them at the bottom of the well, like good hosts,\" you reply with a laugh, \"If they kill us then they kill us, if they don\u0027t then we have a chance at surviving.\"\n\nGideon sighs, \"You think they\u0027ll be able to stop Ragnor and his men, at least?\"\n\n\"The Zealot name, \u0027Chief\u0027 seemed confident, but I doubt it. In Wolf-form, the Wolves can easily rip apart anyone in seconds, regardless of armor. Unless they send more than half of their troops all the way back to fortify the city then they have an issue.\"\n\n\"Let\u0027s hope they do.\" Gideon says with a frown. Well, you can go hope by yourself, Gideon. I\u0027m hoping we both survive this ordeal.\n\nThe two of you wait for a while, unsure how to proceed. Eventually, you both head down the hatch and into the concrete cavern that is under the well. You make your way past the claw-scratches and to the end, where you notice Ragnor thoughtfully closed the plate from on top, instead of leaving it open.\n\n\"This is it, Gideon. Our moment of truth.\" You begin to say, trying to start a conversation.\n\nThe hunchback just nods in return, staring upwards to the closed opening, waiting.\n\nMany minutes pass-by, and when something like an hour passes you wonder whether they abandoned raiding the base at all. You idly stand, shaking in place.\n\nSand slowly begins to pour out of the holes  the plate, the the miniscule dots sprinkling on top of both you and Gideon. Soon, a vague blue light begins to peek in, and you know that the Zealots are here.\n\nYou hear a crackling thud, and soon the plate is kicked over and you notice several flashing figures hunching over the well.\n\n\"You there, below. You are, \u0027Vamp\u0027?\"\n\n\"One and the same.\" You call back, \"The man beside me is Gideon. You wish to come inside?\"\n\nYou see some finger pointing from the three men surrounding the well, and one extremely built character jumps from the top of the well, using his armor as a brake by trying to grab onto the surrounding wall. You laugh inside, realizing that he obviously didn\u0027t notice the ledges on the other side of the cylindrical opening.\n\nThe man takes off his helmet, and what you see surprising you, though you;re not sure why. \"I am the Chief.\" The dark-skinned individual introduces himself, bowing slightly. \"I have brought exactly 32 men here, and the rest to find and kill the Demons approaching the City. Now, what do you want, both of you?\"\n\nGideon stares at the man with a wide smile, though he doesn\u0027t speak. You sigh once again, \"We want you to not kill us, to be frank.\"\n\nChief laughs, and calls upwards, \"Samuel, Zadok, come down and meet these two... Gentleman.\"\n\nSoon after he announces it, the two men watching from above the well jump in from behind Chief, crashing into the concrete with a loud crack. The dust settles, and the man continues, \"The two of you don\u0027t seem too bad, but even the Devil can act gracious-- but that\u0027s acting. How can you prove to us that you\u0027re actually willing of redemption? How can I trust you?\"\n\nThe two men behind him near, and although they aren\u0027t quite up to his size, they don\u0027t seem nearly as friendly.\n\n\"Well, for one, we warned you about the other Creations... Wait, how much men did you send to apprehend them?\"\n\n\"Truth.\" He nods, \"30, why?\"\n\nThat\u0027s 13 Creations against 30 mortals; they\u0027ll be slaughtered... You consider how to answer, but Gideon interjects, \"Chief, the Wolves on their way aren\u0027t pushovers.\"\n\n\"And neither are our soldiers.\"\n\n\"No,\" Gideon continues, \"I\u0027ve seen their leader in action. He is merciless and faster than anything you\u0027ve ever seen. Your precious City won\u0027t hold up!\"\n\nFor the first time, Chief seems alarmed, \"Wait... You are the only De-- Creations here?\"\n\n\"Yeah. We have no time to waste, then. If you want our support in saving the city, then we\u0027ll need your promise of being vouched for.\" You state firmly.\n\nChief nods, while the others watch you both, silent. \"You got it. Now let\u0027s get get back, before it\u0027s too late!\"\n\n\"Alright then,\" you say, \"Let\u0027s get out of here while we can.\" To show them the way, you rush ahead, using the ledges to climb. Gideon and the Zealots follow you up, where you find a horde of patient Zealots, waiting for orders.\n\nChief raises his hands and yells, \"RETREAT BACK TO THE CITY, NOW!\"\n\nThe Zealots\u0027 formation quickly changes and you begin your march to the city, hoping you get there in time...\n",
  "page 250": "Zadok shrugs, \"It\u0027s not really something that everybody has to agree on, but the main concept of one God and a leader doing his best to follow his ways is probably the one thing keeping our City together. Us Zealots believe that almost all religions have a hint of truth to them, but the Holy Writings typically refer to the Old Testament, I think, but we don\u0027t follow that to the word either. The Cross, to us, symbolizes faith and love, but not for others, but to God himself. Jesus was a Dreamer, like the many prophets before-hand and afterwards. But a Dreamer isn\u0027t a prophet-- he\u0027s a sacrifice of his own volition, a vessel for God to inhabit and make an example of. Like the Nazirim in the olden day, they give their life strictly for God. That it why we still use the Cross, for it shows that all our actions are a way to closer our connection with Him. We\u0027re all the children of God, and all of us give our lives to God in a different way. A doctor here is supposed to give his life to God by healing others. I gave my life to God by using it to fight evil.\"\n\n\"And if they don\u0027t believe?\"\n\n\"If they live here then it\u0027s unlikely, but in theory if they openly dissuade people from believing then we\u0027re supposed to give them rations and send them off into the desert. It\u0027s not... Ideal, but they\u0027re supposed come back with a dream and believe again or they never return. That\u0027s what Father declared as a law years ago, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ever happened. I\u0027d like to say it\u0027s because our faith as a nation is so strong, but I think it\u0027s possibly due to fear.\" He shrugs, \"However, those who don\u0027t believe but aren\u0027t offensive about it aren\u0027t trusted by most either way and can\u0027t work, so Father Tomas meets with them to re-inspire their faith. Living in this waste-land is hard on morale, and the priest does what he can to make sure people can work with others and be happy, regardless.\"\n\n\"And this belief system is what Tomas believes?\" You ask, holding back most of your questions. How this place has been held together for 7 years is beyond me...\n\n\"Not really sure. That\u0027s my version, by the way, everybody probably believes differently. Some stricter, others not. The two things universal are that God is up there and that we don\u0027t mess with what he already made. That\u0027s what caused Annihilation, after all.\"\n\n \n",
  "page 132": "With silent haste, the troops march back to the City. The Chief\u0027s strict protocol helps bring the scattered clusters into more orderly groups walking in a rectangular form. You cover plenty of ground in a short amount of time, but the tension builds when a scout comes back with no report on where the Wolves are. By the time you all reach the City, it\u0027s darker than it seemed before...\n\nChief motions over to you, \"You see, there?\" He points to a corner of the City\u0027s hexagonal circumference, \"The Sentries would usually be commandeering a light. But I don\u0027t see them now.\" He pauses to think, then speaks out in his powerful voice, \"Enter Church-City in five groups of six! Never lose sight of a team member and ALWAYS watch your back. Also, remember to turn off your armor\u0027s flash. Now move out!\"\n\nImmediately, the Zealots begin to cluster together, forming the teams, and spreading out and marching into the City. Before his new team begins to enter the City, Chief brings you and Gideon over, \"Now, how shall we stop the Creations inside?\"\n\nGideon replies, \"Especially now in the darkness, it\u0027ll be hard to defend against them. But otherwise it\u0027s find and then kill. Hope for the best, I suppose.\"\n\nYou don\u0027t have a much better answer. You can see that everybody on Chief\u0027s team is equipped with silver weapons, and that\u0027s the only weakness you know about. It all boils down to how much Wolves and Zealots are left inside.\n\nWith a sigh, Chief begins to lead his crew into the City while you and Gideon follow. Even in the darkness the City looks spectacularly flashy-- almost everything made of a flashy metal, with neon lights flashing up every corner. The clanging of metal boots on the harsh concrete makes any attempt of stealth completely pointless, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the Zealot-style anyway. If anything, it looks like your team is looking for a fight. But, after marching through the otherwise quiet streets with no conflict, the group begins to relax slightly. Chief takes out his transceiver, and you can hear some muffled sounds coming from him-- but no response. You look around to notice only another group in a parallel street, but you don\u0027t see anybody else. \n\nSeveral minutes pass, \"Bizarre,\" Chief starts, \"Only one out of the four other groups are responding. You think...\" He trails off, but suddenly the world becomes more tense, and you all remain on high alert.\n\nOut of nowhere, a huge blonde beast smashes through the metal door of what you can only suppose is a Church. The massive hulking figure is leaves a literal rip in the opening, and appears to be bleeding from the mouth-- though you\u0027re pretty certain it\u0027s not from itself. The werewolf stares in your direction, hungrily, and slowly begins to advance.\n\nTerrified, the Zealots in your group begin to open-lightning on it-- though it doesn\u0027t appear to faze it in any way, aside from scorching its fur.\n\n\"Cecilia?\" You yell, trying to distract it by waving your arms in the air. The beast pauses, but then continues pouncing in your direction. You quickly run up to it, and bring all your might into an air-splitting punch at the wolf\u0027s protruding jaw. It doubles over, but not before, in an act of desperation, making a huge swipe for the Zealots trying to spear it; about three Zealots were flung  several meters into the air and back to the floor, only not to wake up. Chief manages to sink the tusks of his rifle into the horrid beast before she turns back into your would-be lover-- Cecilia.\n\nYou spit, trying to make sure your emotions don\u0027t meddle with this. We must take back the City, for humanity\u0027s sake.\n\nBy now, even the other Group appears to not be responding... \"Vampire... We aren\u0027t going to win this fight.\" Chief confesses, clutching at his healthy chest. \"What do we do now?\"\n\n\"You don\u0027t know that, Chief. There can\u0027t be too many Wolves left...\" You reply slowly. As expected, the heavy bounding of paws is heard, and a black Werewolf, standing on its hind legs stares at the remaining of your group with its ruby eyes-- Gideon, Chief, and yourself. The surviving Zealots fled, no doubt to be killed by Ragnor: the black Wolf. With a horrible shriek of a howl, the Wolf slams it\u0027s paw into Chief, hitting awkwardly as he tries to dodge though sending him back long enough for the Wolf to focus on you, grabbing you with its paws-- digging his claws into your skin, and throwing your bleeding corpse almost an entire street.\n\nYour body cuts itself on the concrete, and even though it heals itself you can feel the pain of a dislocated shoulder and a broken wrist and several ribs. You manage to get up, albeit slowly, only to witness an Albino Wolf wrestling with a darker one, both relatively similar mass but different in proportion. The white one (Gideon) seems to be shorter, though more muscular, while the stygian Wolf (Ragnor) manages to be taller and much more overbearing; much like how they are in their regular forms.\n\nYou run towards Ragnor, hoping to help Gideon out in the fight, but the white monster eyes you while it struggles against the darker one, it barks in your direction, as if telling you to get the hell out of this while they duke it out. As Ragnor sinks his teeth into Gideon shoulder, a horrible howl is let out-- and it soon becomes apparent that Gideon it outmatched.\n\nTaken aback, you meekly help the Chief up-- who\u0027s mesmerized by the masochistic display going on by the two forces at work. Gideon grasps the younger wolf by its throat, and manages to get on top in the scuffle. The two continue to exchange blows, blood squirting out into the floor, until... Gideon slows down, and with a final, angry bark-- he is killed.\n\nRagnor feasts on his killed with a hungry lust; ripping at his enemy\u0027s fleshy neck, and happily ripping out and crunching on whatever bones he finds. While Chief continues to blankly stare, you decide that its time you took action on Ragnor, and with the rage built inside of you, the death of Gideon; the one honestly good person you\u0027ve met, manage to take the Wolf off-guard with a bull-rush. You sink your own claws into the wolf-man\u0027s throat, hacking into it. The heavier and stronger animal attempts to crush your midsection with its bare hands before you can kill it, but your swipes prove affective enough with the additional injuries Ragnor got from the White Wolf.\n\nAs the fight comes to a close, you find yourself soaked in blood and on top of a dead, un-regenerating corpse. You find the Chief bowing down to the floor, praying in a language you don\u0027t understand. After several moments he stands, in shock. Unlike before, there are no sounds; just the deathly chill of the wind.\n\n\"What-- what now?\" Comes his pathetic voice.\n\n\"We... We find the other Creations, and bring them to justice.\" You bring a bleeding hand to your brow, \"Think about it; this can\u0027t be the only civilization left, and there are bound to be other Creations wishing to do harm to others. But you and I, we can stop them. We can find a way through the desert.\"\n\nChief nods, \"But I don\u0027t think I can carry on with you, for I just... My legs... they aren\u0027t moving!\"\n\nWith a grin, you sink your teeth into his neck, and suck-- but not too much, just enough to ghoul him. The salty blood isn\u0027t as enjoyable since after today\u0027s events, but you\u0027d be lying if you weren\u0027t.... Thirsty.\n\nThe former-Zealot stands erect, ready to be at your command. \"Shall we be off then?\"\n\n\"We shall.\"\n\n\nYou have managed to survive in your undeath and leave a possible legacy, but the questions remain! What happened to Kelso? What about the Professor? What could have happened if you had chosen a different path?\n",
  "page 253": "Zadok stops to scratch at his stubble at his stubble before answering. \"Funny you should ask. There really seem to be some sort of history between you two which I don\u0027t know of, but Alice is like a sister to me since Annihilation. We found her in one of Kurschner\u0027s Facilities, apparently she interned at the place before that asshole went crazy. Well, crazier. It was one of the Zealots\u0027 first raids, about two weeks before God\u0027s fires ravaged the Earth. She was flustered and confused, and so I, young as I was, convinced Father Tomas to let her in. By then the City was a barricaded City which attracted the religious, and all over the country people came, but the Father liked to inspect the people that came. So I vouched for her, out of sympathy because I don\u0027t think she\u0027 have passed.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Weren\u0027t-chalistenin\u0027?\" He asks, raising an eyebrow, \"She worked side-by-side with Kurschner, Creator of Demons. Damn so-called scientist helped destroy the world with his \u0027solution\u0027.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" So, that\u0027s how she must have known about me...\n\n\"Man, I keep forgetting just how clueless you are,\" he says grimly, \"Simon Kurschner was the man who the progressive government funded to mess with God\u0027s creations, humans. He tried to make humans, \u0027better\u0027, immortal and impervious to disease. The nonbeliever created the demons, see, and Alice, while obviously not in his leagues, was obviously not a good fit with the rest of the Citizens. To this day I\u0027m not sure if she really believes, but thank God things worked out for the best. Father keeps a close watch on her and she was a great addition to the community. Now she lives with me because I guess... I dunno, she was living in a crappy office in the library and she honestly does make the days more bearable. I like my Zealot-buddies but, you know, you need some interaction that is more eh... Permanent. After my promotion Father Tomas gave me that large house since he thinks I\u0027m gonna marry Alice or something, but that\u0027s not it. She\u0027s just nice to have around.\"\n\n\"I guess I understand,\" you reply, \"so you\u0027re just friends with her, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that\u0027s right, you can make your move.\" He guffaws, giving you a pat on the back and laughing once again.\n\nZadok is one odd guy... \"Uh, that\u0027s not what I was getting at, actually.\"\n\n\"Right.\" He answers with a sly grin. \"But don\u0027t worry, after we talk to the Father I think you\u0027ll have plenty of access to having a family. New blood is only a good thing for the town, I say.\"\n\n\"What about you then?\" You laugh back.\n\n\"Maybe when we\u0027re done with the Wolves next door. Then we\u0027ll be safe and maybe I can do something then, but not now.\"\n\n\"Who\u0027re they?\"\n\n\"I think you\u0027ll find out soon enough.\"\n",
  "page 252": "Zadok almost instantly replies, \"God, obviously.\"\n\nYou hold back your laughter-- though you aren\u0027t sure why you find it amusing, \"No, I mean, how is it governed? Does Tomas, err, Father Tomas just lead everybody and you all listen?\"\n\nThe Zealot doesn\u0027t bother withholding his laughter, \"Of course not! The Father and his disciples deal with the matters of direction; what the people need to stock up on, morale, the like...\"\n\n\"Disciples?\"\n\n\"His disciples were voted in by the citizens-- basically just regular people known to be God-fearing and willing to give their life to studying mysticism and religion with the Father. They\u0027re more or less monks. Anyway, the religion-division works with the Zealot leaders-- Chief, myself, and Karat. Ranking in descending order. Father Tomas actually has more influence than us, since we mostly just keep the peace, collect taxes outlined in the Holy Writings, and hun-- but that\u0027s for a good reason. The Zealots fight for God while the Father leads people to serve God. Him and the disciples discuss laws that are introduced by his weekly sermons, and we make sure they are enforced. Thankfully, there is little crime around here. We realize that Gd is always watching, so even with a small police force that\u0027s usually already divided between tasks and even less ability to find criminals thanks to our limited tech, we get a lot of sharing of necessities between neighbors and practically no murder. The City as it is now is actually pretty young-- I mean, it\u0027s only been what, 7 years since Annihilation? But we get by...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, trying to process everything, \"Annihilation? Demons? What happened?\"\n\n\"Well, immorality and God\u0027s justice. We\u0027re simply paying for the after-affects of meddling with God\u0027s creations and allowing evil to poison our youth.\" Zadok stops facing you to look up at the moon, before adding, \"It was the equivalent of The Flood, but with Fire and brimstone, as prophesied in the Writings.\"\n\nOkay... \"How did the people here survive, then? And, uh, what are the demons left?\"\n\n\"People believing in the Rapture made bunkers way before it happened, saw some flares after the fallout and heard of the only City that missed the explosion. We used to get a lot of refugees, Father Tomas took a lot of us in. But we haven\u0027t had anybody new for years. Reason why you\u0027re such a mystery, eh?\" He ribs you in the side with a weak chuckle, \"But there\u0027s still demons-- the ones that helped bring about this Calamity, that are able to survive under these conditions. Bloodsuckers, shape-shifters, more. That\u0027s what Father Tomas calls them, and I\u0027ve killed the buggers up close. Vile, insane creatures that can plow through an entire battalion of Zealots. Most don\u0027t talk, and the ones that do plead innocence and sentience before they swallow your best friend whole. That\u0027s why hunt them-- unholy freaks of nature, see. They dig burrows in the dirt, trying to hide. But we\u0027re weeding out the ones in the area. In the seven years we\u0027ve been here, Father told us not to leave the premises, but now he\u0027s changed his policies, wants to find other living populations and such. Which is good, this place needed change.\"\n\nYou only nod before taking the conversation elsewhere.\n\n \n",
  "page 112": "You continue to stand parallel to the Head-Zealot, slowly beckoning him closer to the side with a ledge. While you know you have to end the fight soon, you also know that this won\u0027t be an easy fight. The cackling priest advances, holding his heavy Cross out like a rapier, poking it at you, trying to get you to move back. Deciding that staying on the defensive won\u0027t save you from this mad man, you take action by leaping in his direction-- he grins, preparing to simply swing upwards to hit you, but manage to somersault out of the old man\u0027s swipe, and land a heavy kick to his face. He staggers backwards, his hand on his eye in a mixture of pain and anger. Tomas angrily sends another swipe with his sword at you, but you\u0027re already charging for him, pushing the old to the ledge that is now to your right with your forearm. The priest coughs, but quickly recovers.\n\nRelentless, you send another barrage of jabs at him, moving close enough to him that his long-range won\u0027t be an advantage for him. A mixture of punches and claws manage to cut his robe to shreds, and he struggles to get you off of him-- to no avail. After a silly, pointless scuffle you manage to hold him right by the ledge, where a fall to the death would await him. Tomas holds up his silver cross, creating a pseudo-barrier between the two of you, but you just grab hold of it with your gauntlets, and shove him at the wooden slabs, and slowly increase pressure, slowly increase it. Several seconds more of pushing, and he won\u0027t have a choice of how his body breaks, as you\u0027ll secure his death in the fall. You shove once more...\n\nSnap.\n\n\"There we go... See you in hell, bastard!\" The wooden splinters open, and you find the two of you tumbling down at several meters, both grasping for eachothers\u0027 throats.\n\nUnfortunately for you, the old man barely manages to grab hold of your hair and uses it as leverage to be just slightly above you...\n\nYou both fall with a heavy thud, your armored body crashing through the floor. You struggle to get out of it, as you find your armor almost embedded in to the rubble. Still, you manage to get up, and the sharp pang you feel in your head slowly begins to disappear.\n\nAs the dust clears, you find a bleeding Tomas with a bloody eye holding an unconscious David to the wall, his silver sword still gripped in his hands. His remaining useable eye stares right at you, and the priest begins to cackle further, \"If you take even one more step towards me, I swear I will slay your disciple right now. But, if you leave me here to die in peace, not of a sinners hand, then I can promise that I will not kill him. Hmm, you like this deal?\"\n\nYour loyal ghoul stares at you blankly, and his shaking head can either be interpreted as a plea to let him live or to kill the priest. Or perhaps something else?\n\nStunned and still recovering, you try to make a decision with a clear head...\n",
  "page 233": "Zadok cracks his neck; then he shrugs, \"Well, fine, I suppose. Evening just started, though, so and The Father is pretty big on late-night studying, so you\u0027ll have the night to think it over. I mean, he\u0027ll probably make an exception for a refugee like you, but it makes it easier to do it tomorrow, I guess. You know, Father Tomas is a saint, but he\u0027s really cool. Level-headed, down to earth, you know? Think about it, anyway.\"\n\nThe Zealot continues after a pause, \" Anyway, you want to, eat or something? And you gotta come up with a name, too weird to just refer to you by pointing, haha.\"\n\nYou give a weary chuckle, \"Yeah, I bet I\u0027ll come up with something. As for something to... Eat, you said?\" Human meat... \"No, not that...\" you mumble with a shiver.\n\n\"Huh?\" The Zealot looks behind himself before looking at you quizzically, \"Right. Well, Alice makes awesome tea, you know. Rare to find the right ingredients for it and hot water is hard to come by, so you\u0027d be lucky to get some of it.\" He pauses, \"But do you want some? Or, uh, you know-- something?\"\n\n\"Uh, no need, really. I\u0027m fine.\" Couldn\u0027t drink it anyway. I think?\n\n\"You sure?\" Zadok asks, his brows furrowing as he rubs his chin. \"Don\u0027t be shy man, I think you could use it more than the average person we help out. You look beat.\"\n\n\"Well... Alright.\" You comply with a frown. \"If you really want to, you know...\"\n\nHe gets up to give you a pat on the back, and then he leaves. You hear some discussion, but you can\u0027t exactly make it out. Several moments pass and you take the time to get up and stretch your limbs. It takes several twists and turns but eventually your forearms and legs relax to the point of being as spry as ever. Your mind wanders to several points; How long can I go on without blood? How much does Alice know about me? How am I going to hide my existence as a creature of the dead? And what is the Father going to do with me once I\u0027m in his clutches?\n\nYou take an unnecessary deep breath, your lungs not expanding or contracting as you do so, the air going in and out, straight. You take Zadok\u0027s seat near the door, waiting for the tea to be ready. What\u0027s taking so long?\n\nSoon later, you hear footsteps nearing your room. The long dark-haired Alice knocks on what you assume is some sort of post (as the door was left wide-open by Zadok) before entering. She takes a deep breath before handing you a modest cup of a dark red liquid with a wobbly hand, the other maintaining its spot near her waist.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you state, accepting it, though juggling whether you should drink it, still uncertain on how your anatomy works.\n\nAlice closes the door behind her, \"Don\u0027t worry, you can drink it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nHer voice is different than the ones you\u0027ve heard as of recently-- English, maybe? Either way, you\u0027ve decided it sounds rather pleasant. Just... Nice sounding. You notice her left hand clenching as she winces out, \"It... It\u0027s safe for you to drink the tea. Trust me.\"\n\nUncertain and more than just confused, you take a sip out of the tea. Once you swallow, you feel the familiar euphoria you had before, though admittedly watered down. She put blood in this, didn\u0027t she?\n\nYou look up, \"Alice, you know who I am? What happened to me? Please tell me!\"\n\n\"Zadok said he wants to take you to see Father Tomas. You... You can\u0027t...\" Alice continues, grasping at her hair.\n\n\"Why-- Why not?\"\n\n\"Father Tomas is our leader, and a good one! But...\"\n\n\"But what?\" You respond, getting up. You\u0027re not really sure what to do-- she\u0027s beginning to tear up...\n\n\"Just don\u0027t, please. He\u0027ll either kill you or use you, that\u0027s it!\"\n\n\"Use me? For what? What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe nears you, tears in her green eyes, placing her hands on your cheeks. \"If you promise to not meet him then I-- I\u0027ll tell you things abut the... The past. You don\u0027t need Tomas!\"\n\nFor whatever reason, you feel drawn to her. It\u0027s an unnatural feeling, and although you don\u0027t remember her at all, something about her makes you long for something of the past, though you\u0027re not sure what it is. Bottom line is, however, you have no idea what she\u0027s on about.\n\n\"Um, Alice, I never planned to go see him,\" you nervously chuckle. \"But, I mean, it\u0027s an interesting proposition, I guess. This Tomas guy, if anybody would know about the Professor...\"\n\nAlice looks like she was going to say something else, but instead just releases your face and asks, \"Who?\"\n\nYou sigh, \"You probably know him by some other moniker. But to me, he\u0027s the man who created me. That\u0027s about all I know, but I need to put a stop to whatever he\u0027s planning now that the Facility housing myself was destroyed.\"\n\nAlice\u0027s eyes brighten up, as if she never was crying in the first place, \"Oh! You don\u0027t need Tomas for that. I can help you find Kurschner... Probably... If he\u0027s still around... Maybe.\"\n\n\"Well...\" You take a deep breath, \"That\u0027s very, uh, kind of you, Alice. But how you you do that? Tomas leads this place, right? So he can help me. Maybe even give me a purpose of some sort. Somehow, you know about me and my... Needs, but he has the influence to have it used for good! He could help me fit in here, instead of having to hide myself from the world outside of the house.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m his secretary,\" she states, matter-of-factly, \"so I have access to pretty much everything he does and more.\"-- Right before turning around to leave in a huff.\n\nMaybe she can lead me to my past... She seems to know me, sort of. But Tomas seems like a much more... Stable(?) bet.\n",
  "page 111": "Man, these bastards are quick.\n\nYou may have gotten lucky with the Vadim fellow, but the rest, now pumping with adrenaline, are much harder to hit. The bald men may not be especially strong, but they\u0027re skilled enough that they can at least dodge and block your powerful claws and punches. Of course, they\u0027re bound to get tired after a minute or so of constant movement, but I need to get this done quickly.\n\n\"Oof.\" One grunts as you land a knee into his groin, he stumbles to your side, where a heavy-set Monk elbows at your ribs-- only to miss and be targeted by David, who was unsuccessfully trying to down a midget of a Zealot. Your ghoul manages to leap atop of him and .wrap his arms around the man\u0027s neck.\n\n\"What... happened.... to you... my.... friend...\" Are his last words.\n\nThe remaining monks still take up your time, giving quick jabs to your non-existent pressure points as you try to land a hit on them. The acrobats continue dodging, and you relentlessly continue, not hampered by mortal energy-consumption. They begin to slow, and your wild, badly-timed swings catch several of the surrounding monks, crushing their bones easily. Minutes passed, the only one standing is the sweating midget named, \u0027Miguel\u0027, who hopelessly kneels before you, \"O how the lord has bested us, taught us a lesson in humility in dream-form, he did. Wake us from this nightmare, O merciful God!\"\n\nYou punt him across the room, cackling as you do so.\n\nUnfortunately for yourself and David, you can hear sirens-- Ragnor has begun his siege. You look from around you, and in front of you appears a pruned old man, wearing a ceremonial blue robe and a skullcap, wielding a shining... silver cross? Only, upside-down... As a sword... Father Tomas stares at you with a surprisingly serene smile, considering what you did with his disciples. \"My monks did their part, do not worry, Vampire.\"\n\nMoments later, the old man throws his heavy rod with unreal accuracy and force, impaling your belly and opening it, spilling some gastric juices, but that\u0027s all. You feel your body convulsing as the holy metals sucks at your life force. You groan in pain, and kneel before the lord...\n\nIf only you finished this man earlier.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 113": "You plant your feet sturdily into the flooring, watching his sword with caution. Whenever he moves closer, you move forward and around him, bringing him closer to the ledge and maintaining an important amount of distance between the two of you. Tomas chuckles, and finally begins swinging his heavy artifact. He does so not wildly, rather with strong, fluid motions; all of which your utmost concentration allow you to just barely dodge. His long strokes give him a lot of range, and you have a feeling that he\u0027s only just started.\n\nHe picks up the pace, using his heavy sword more like a rapier, thrusting and swiping, attempting to corner you to the other side of the room; that isn\u0027t necessarily bad, as it\u0027s the side  that has the ledge, but you need to quickly get back in control of the fight if you wish to get the old fool.\n\nTomas advances, giving another quick thrust with his sword-- you try to take advantage of that by kicking his sword out of his hands, but his firm grip doesn\u0027t let go of it. Not wasting the opportunity, you leap at him while he rebalances the sword, and try to land a heavy claw at his neck. Seeing you, the old man, with bizarre agility,  drops to the floor, and sweeps your legs from under you, knocking your head on the rails. You quickly get back up with a sharp twist, but he has enough time to give you a thwack on the back with his sword. The pain stings, and you feel your bones crack as he smacks you upside the head again with it, over an over again. Every time you attempt you get up, you are taken out again by Tomas\u0027s repetitive strikes. Can\u0027t... Get back up...\n\nBefore you know it,\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 116": "\"I\u0027m glad you made the right choice, Vamp.\" Ragnor beams, and Cecilia gives you an excited thumbs-up. Gideon, on the other hand, simple glares at Ragnor, shakes his head, and takes a seat on a broken bench. \"You sure you don\u0027t want to reconsider?\" Ragnor asks, rubbing at his chin.\n\nGideon makes no answer.\n\n\"Forget it.\" He waves his hand, \"Alright, guys, let\u0027s do this!\" You all clamber out of the hatch and out of the well. The starry night opens up from above you and the darkness gives light to other matters. The Zealots, no doubt very ritualistic, are maintaining their flashing armor, which you vaguely make out from several miles away. You point them out to Ragnor, and he makes note of them.\n\n\"That\u0027s a lot of Zealots on their way, I hope they don\u0027t have that much more fortifying the inside. Ragnor, do you have a plan for this?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The Wolf grunts, scratching at his head furiously. \"God damnit! If Gideon came, he could have lead a group, and we\u0027d have two solid teams, flanking the enemy fortress.\"\n\n\"Can\u0027t I lead?\" You ask, uncertain of his plan.\n\n\"You could, but that\u0027d be a waste of you\u0027re abilities. We\u0027re going to send you inside of it, where you\u0027ll be trying to assassinate the leaders of the Zealots. That way our assault can succeed in their confusion.\"\n\n\"Okay...\" You nod, trying to visualize your role in this plan, \"So what about David?\"\n\n\"David isn\u0027t exactly a leading-personality.\"\n\n\"He knows what he\u0027s doing.\"\n\n\"Which is why he should come with you! He\u0027d be much more useful by you than with us. We\u0027re just giving you time. We can have one of the other Wolves lead, but for now you will no doubt need help, and a former Zealot who knows the inner working of the compound is just perfect.\"\n",
  "page 237": "You breathe in to begin speaking, but the only thing you let out is what you just breathed in; Alice leaves your room. You stand in silence, somewhat assured that you are making the correct, most reasonable choice-- and yet, you feel somewhat put-off by what just happened. You take a seat and meditate-- a technique you\u0027ve found to be particularly useful to pass time, as well as to clear your head.\n\nPerhaps an hour passes when you hear another knock on your door. \"Hey man,\" comes a whisper, \"It\u0027s Zadok, you ready to go?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" You look around, unsure what you could really bring. \"I think so. Can I meet the Father with this hoodie?\"\n\n\"Keep your voice down!.. And yeah, I guess.\"\n\nYou sigh, getting up out of your chair and calmly nodding to Zadok. \"Is the Father expecting us?\"\n\n\"Not... Exactly. Alice wasn\u0027t very happy when I told her you were coming with me to meet him for some reason. I guess she talked to you about it too?\"\n\n\"Y-yeah.\"\n\n\"Care telling me what it was about?\"\n\n\"Uh, I guess she didn\u0027t want Father Tomas to bother me while I was recovering.\" You white-lie, still unsure how to tackle the fact that while you wish to repent; the Zealots probably wouldn\u0027t be too happy knowing that your existence contradicts their way of life.\n\n\"Hmm, I think she likes you,\" Zadok chuckles. \"Guess you feel better, then?\"\n\n\"Sort of, but mostly I just really want to meet Father Tomas. I think that, if anybody, he\u0027d be able to fill me in on what\u0027s happening.\"\n\n\"Good thinking, Now, let\u0027s get going.\"\n\nYou leave for the outdoors, only to find the dull City looming over you in the moon-light. Each house a grayer variation of the other, bland and gloomy. The only color comes from flashy neon-lights which unnecessarily labeled the various buildings, as well as serve as markers for the street. As you follow Zadok through several arrays of gray buildings, you pass several unoccupied stands with signs depicting fruit, the pink-neon lights flashing, \"MARKET\".\n\nYou continue, until you come across two parallel buildings- both the largest in the City. One has a giant neon Cross, flashing through the night on its face, separating two powerful metal doors; and the other with an upside-down blue Cross, the doors also stainless steel.\n\n\"That there is the Zealot Head Quarters,\" Zadok points out, noticing your confusion on the upside-down Cross. \"It shows how we have to sometimes twist the Holy Word if we are to preserve it. It\u0027s an unfortunate truth, but our Sword of God is just. Sometimes we have to kill-- even if it\u0027s forbidden, we need to defend ourselves. Get it?\"\n\nYou nod, realizing that that\u0027s how they must justify slaughtering Creations, like Kelso mentioned. I wonder what\u0027s up with that bastard... And now that I think about it, I wonder how much of what he said is true.\n\n\"And that\u0027s the Main Church, where Father Tomas and his monks live. That\u0027s where we\u0027ll be going. Got any questions?\"\n",
  "page 115": "You continue to stand parallel to the Head-Zealot, slowly beckoning him closer to the side with a ledge. While you know you have to end the fight soon, you also know that this won\u0027t be an easy fight. The cackling priest advances, holding his heavy Cross out like a rapier, poking it at you, trying to get you to move back. Deciding that staying on the defensive won\u0027t save you from this mad man, you take action by leaping in his direction-- he grins, preparing to simply swing upwards to hit you, but manage to somersault out of the old man\u0027s swipe, and land a heavy kick to his face. He staggers backwards, his hand on his eye in a mixture of pain and anger. Tomas angrily sends another swipe with his sword at you, but you\u0027re already charging for him, pushing the old to the ledge that is now to your right with your forearm. The priest coughs, but quickly recovers.\n\nRelentless, you send another barrage of jabs at him, moving close enough to him that his long-range won\u0027t be an advantage for him. A mixture of punches and claws manage to cut his robe to shreds, and he struggles to get you off of him-- to no avail. After a silly, pointless scuffle you manage to hold him right by the ledge, where a fall to the death would await him. Tomas holds up his silver cross, creating a pseudo-barrier between the two of you, but you just grab hold of it with your gauntlets, and shove him at the wooden slabs, and slowly increase pressure, slowly increase it. Several seconds more of pushing, and he won\u0027t have a choice of how his body breaks, as you\u0027ll secure his death in the fall. You shove once more...\n\nSnap.\n\n\"There we go... See you in hell, bastard!\" The wooden splinters open, and you find the two of you tumbling down at several meters, both grasping for eachothers\u0027 throats.\n\nUnfortunately for you, the old man barely manages to grab hold of your hair and uses it as leverage to be just slightly above you...\n\nYou both fall with a heavy thud, your armored body crashing through the floor. You struggle to get out of it, as you find your armor almost embedded in to the rubble. Still, you manage to get up, and the sharp pang you feel in your head slowly begins to disappear.\n\nAs the dust clears, you find a bleeding Tomas with a bloody eye holding an unconscious David to the wall, his silver sword still gripped in his hands. His remaining useable eye stares right at you, and the priest begins to cackle further, \"If you take even one more step towards me, I swear I will slay your disciple right now. But, if you leave me here to die in peace, not of a sinners hand, then I can promise that I will not kill him. Hmm, you like this deal?\"\n\nYour loyal ghoul stares at you blankly, and his shaking head can either be interpreted as a plea to let him live or to kill the priest. Or perhaps something else?\n\nStunned and still recovering, you try to make a decision with a clear head...\n",
  "page 236": "\"Err, hey!\" You stutter, grabbing at her shoulder. Feeling your presence, she stops her exit long enough for you to continue speaking. After loosening your grip, you continue, \"Sorry about that, Alice, I... I won\u0027t go to Tomas. I\u0027m sure we can find a way to hide my-- my condition, right? Kill two birds with one rock-- or something.\"\n\nAlice finally turns to face you, wearing a weary smile and  a curiously thoughtful expression. Again, it appears like she was never even upset, \"We\u0027ll find a way, don\u0027t worry. Together I-- I think we can make this work, somehow...\"\n\nOvercome with feeling, you let her attempt to warm up beside you, only to slowly let go when she realizes how low your body temperature.\n\n\"We\u0027ll find a way.\" You repeat, perhaps trying to assure yourself more than her.\n\n\"R-right,\" she starts, after a moment of silence, \"well, Zadok won\u0027t be back until later, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll tell Tomas until later on after the talk we had, so we\u0027re safe. And-- and, Zadok has some clothes you can borrow, and you can join the Zealots as a civilian, for a long while, I\u0027d bet.\"\n\n\"Err, what exactly are you saying?\" You interrupt, trying to clarify what she means.\n\nShe grins, \"What do you think? You\u0027ll have to masquerade as a human. We can, um, introduce you as a refugee from the nomads or something. I\u0027ll do my research-- I\u0027m \u0027the\u0027 secretary, so accessing information like what you\u0027ll be wanting and more is pretty much at my disposal.\"\n\n\"So what will I be doing?\"\n\n\"Well, you\u0027ll have to be introduced into the community, as well as keep a profile low enough that Tomas won\u0027t really bother you...\"\n\n\"How often do you get \u0027refugees\u0027?\" You question, not really liking this part of the plan.\n\nShe bites her lip, \"Well, um, you\u0027re our first since the Devastation.\"\n\nFantastic. \"So you said you knew me-- know me-- whatever?\" You say, now attempting to understand your predicament as well as you can, \"I still can\u0027t wrap my head ver what happened. I don\u0027t remember much, but I certainly remember it not being this way. All desert...\"\n\nAlice rubs the back of her neck, \"It\u0027s... hard to explain. We were both young then, though you remain mostly unchanged. I wasn\u0027t really into the politics, but I remember it being rough. Terrorism worldwide, influenza, and some called bluffs in terms of nuclear warfare...\n\nAnd while religious opportunists were able to sway the blame on certain laws passed and repealed, \u0027science\u0027 came about once again to fix a solution. Dr. Kurschner created a program to fix the terrorism, stop disease, and rebuild after the oncoming nuclear devastation. That\u0027s where,\" she clears her throat, \"where you came in. Simon Kurschner\u0027s program involved genetic manipulation. This gained more traction than the religious response, which was against his program throughout. With government funding he made several facilities where he\u0027d more or less create super-soldiers, comic-book stuff, you know...\"\n\nYou notice that she almost seems like she\u0027s tearing for real now, \"It\u0027s alright, we can continue later, you know...\"\n\n\"No, I owe you this much.\" She says, wiping her face with a sleeve. \"But, while his Creations were successful-- as in they overcame the militant radicals and the disease, they soon broke loose. Some of them at least.\" She stops, \"But before that, you got hit in an accident, everything preserved, and He came...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath.\n\n\"But I suspect you never really died. You fell into a-- a coma, he said, that he said you would die in, so the bastard took you in and made you into...\" She begins prodding at your lifeless and clammy hands. \"Th-this... He was our he taught at the college, you know... He was such an absolutely sweet man. Somehow turned into such a horrible monster...\"\n\nAs she begins to babble, you put your hand back on her shoulder, \"So that\u0027s it, partly. Thanks for that, but... I really want to know more about, uh, me. There\u0027s so much I want to know about my past life, and you know it, don\u0027t you?\"\n\n\"I do.\" She says, grabbing your hand and taking it off of her, \"But I don\u0027t think you need to know it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The you you are now is you, silly.\" She giggles, \"It\u0027s not really something you should concern yourself about, just focus on your new history, the now.\"\n\nYou sigh, \"Well, can you at least tell me what my name is?\"\n\nShe laughs, \"You have the opportunity to begin anew... And I won\u0027t spoil that by giving you a label, dear. Your persona is your own, now.\"\n",
  "page 118": "\"Alright,\" you reply with a nod, \"David will definitely be a huge help, considering that he\u0027s familiar with the area, but...\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\nYou frown, \"I hope you guys\u0027ll be safe. The Zealots, especially in number, aren\u0027t pushovers.\"\n\nRagnor smiles, and gives you a brotherly hug, \"Don\u0027t worry Vamp, we\u0027ll manage. The Wolves aren\u0027t exactly pushovers either haha.\"\n\n\"I know.\" You grin, returning the hug. You imagine, that after all this ends-- the fighting, you can retire, and just live your unlife with your new family. A dream, perhaps, but it\u0027s something to hope for. Soon after Ragnor turns to leave, he suddenly looks back at you, pupils dilated.\n\n\"Wait a sec, David was a Zealot before you ghouled him, right?\"\n\n\"Err, yeah.\"\n\n\"And he\u0027s still wearing his armor?\"\n\n\"Everything but the helmet.\"\n\n\"You think they\u0027d recognize him?\"\n\nA pause begins, and ends with laughter. Ragnor snaps at you and puts on a silly grin, and jogs ahead back to his groups. You don\u0027t know who will head the second group, but you hope that it won\u0027t matter. All you need to do is wreak havoc in the city, and stay alive. The assault groups will do the rest, hopefully without harm as well.\n\nWith David silently in tow, you continue on, analyzing the strong hold. Even from afar, the sleepless City is easily seen, and as you march on around the incoming Zealots, you can see how they set up the City\u0027s defense. Six sentries, commandeering strobe lights in a hexagonal circumference around the city, obviously looking out for unidentified enemies. Thankfully, flashing-Zealot armor is pretty identifiable, and so is David\u0027s face, assumably.\n\n\"David?\" You call, looking to make sure he\u0027s listening. He nods in return, but doesn\u0027t speak. \"You think the Zealots will recognize you if they see you?\"\n\n\"Definitely, why?\"\n\n\"Since that means that you can draw attention due to your disappearance while I kill the head-honchos.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s smart.\" He says, succinct as usual.\n\nYou quit trying to make conversation and, once you get close enough to the City, point at the Zealot commandeering the strobe light in front of you. \"Can you kill him before he turns to a radio?\"\n\nDavid nods, and clicks on his blinking Cross-armor (you figure that it\u0027s to ward off friendly-fire) before he begins the march through the strobe light, waving his hands in the air and running to the Sentry. After several moments, you can see a wordless discussion taking place, starting with the sentry saluting and ending with him unconscious on the floor. When David turns the light a bit to the right, it gives you dark-space to walk through, unnoticed.\n\nThe two groups are not too far away, and you manage to wave to Cecilia and Ragnor before following David into the urban Church City. You pat David\u0027s back and consider your good decision making. But, once again, you just hope the others will be alright...\n",
  "page 239": "Alice seems to hold back something as she shrugs, \"Well, we\u0027re supposed to be getting married...\"\n\nYou blink, taken by surprised. In turn, the girls just laughs, \"It\u0027s not like that, really. Zadok and I are like siblings, more or less. Tomas gave Zadok a new residence after a Wolf-attack about a year ago, and the extra space was because he assumed we were getting married. Zadok is... Really great, and it\u0027s really nice of him to let me stay, as well as you. Makes me thinks he gets lonely.... Or just really likes to have someone clean up after him. Old Tomas probably still thinks we\u0027re just waiting to put a ring on it.\"\n\nYou give a weak chuckle, glad that that was settled. Feeling a bit embarrassed to have asked the question in the first place, you switch the conversation to another peculiarity, \"When Zadok was referring to Tomas he always gave him the title of \u0027Father\u0027, but you don\u0027t seem to use it.\"\n\n\"You noticed?\" She smirks, \"Tomas is a distant relative of mine, actually, but I can\u0027t really give him the same respect for other reasons.\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"Well, to put it in perspective: we live in a Survivalist Theocracy, as we call it. Tomas and his monks lead it in the name of God, where Zadok\u0027s branch of office is the Zealots, who go out to defend our City in the name of Tomas for God. The Zealots fight and hunt under him, but I help Tomas write his speeches, and I see him... Propagandizing, I think is the word? I\u0027m not much of a believer-- well I guess I am, sorta, but even if it\u0027s to restore confidence, I don\u0027t think scapegoating all the Creations is the way to go.\"\n\nAs you ponder in thought, you realize that Alice is beginning to yawn. Perhaps it\u0027s time to leave it be, for now.\n",
  "page 117": "You take a step back, standing by Gideon\u0027s side. \"I\u0027m sorry too, Ragnor. But I simply don\u0027t think think this is the way to go.\"\n\nRagnor stares back at you intently, before shrugging, \"Alright then, Vamp. I\u0027m not going to force either of you. But what about your ghoul?\"\n\n\"David?\" You look around, searching for him. He is currently standing stiff by Ragnor\u0027s side, parallel to you. You\u0027re surprised you didn\u0027t take note of this already.\n\n\"Yeah. I\u0027ve talked to him, and he seems to sympathize with our cause. But, since I still more than an iota of respect for you,\" Ragnor pauses, giving you time to understand, \"I\u0027d rather not cause strife from after death between us. So, may I ask for you to allow him to come with us?\"\n\nWith a deep breath, you firmly reply back, \"If he really wants to go, then he can follow you to oblivion.\"\n\n\"That is all I want from you, Vamp. See you in whatever hell we end up in, eh?\" He smiles and takes a hand out to shake.\n\nYou wave him goodbye, but don\u0027t shake, \"See you on the flip side, man. Good luck.\"\n\nRagnor suddenly stands with a more serious attitude, and turns to leave, the Wolf Encampment. Within minutes, Gideon and you are alone. Silence dominates the room for a long while before you speak up.\n\n\"Gideon, the Zealots are on their way right now. What are we going to do?\"\n\nThe hunchback takes his time finding a nice seat to reply from on, \"Convince them.\"\n\n\"Convince them of what?\" You ask, baffled.\n\n\"Convince them that we\u0027re the least of their worries.\"\n\n\"You mean sabotage the assault?\"\n\n\"Of course. You have a better idea?\"\n\n\"... I can\u0027t say, yet. But I can tell you one thing, none of my plans would ever include the possibility of leading the Zealots to kill our brothers!\" You bring your palm to your brow, \"Seriously, Gideon, what kind of idea is that?\"\n\n\"One that preserves the sanctity of life that doesn\u0027t leech off of others\u0027.\"\n\n\"And you don\u0027t think they\u0027ll turn right around to kill us?\"\n\n\"Hey, if you can convince them we aren\u0027t actually Demons from outer space, then we should try that out first, but for now I\u0027m satisfied with dying with the knowledge that I helped save the human race.\"\n",
  "page 238": "Alice takes a moment to think of what to say, \"He was, uh... Well, as I said he was a researcher. Brilliant man-- I think you may call him the \u0027Professor\u0027 because he taught at a university before he became famous. Or maybe because he just liked the label enough that he just called himself that in front of you-- you and his other experiments. Not sure, really...\"\n\n\"I was actually more wondering on how he looked...\" You state, hoping that something will make your remember.\n\n\"Well, he had blonde hair, glasses, and wore a lab coat. Ooh! And he had a limp. But that\u0027s pretty standard for any mad scientist, right?\" She laughs.\n\n\"I suppose.\"\n\n\"Seriously though, he was pretty easy to identify-- though I think he may have joined his own program, which could changed his appearance and limp.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I think that... When he realized that his experiments weren\u0027t listening I think he tried a lot of things on himself, see, he saw that things weren\u0027t working out the way they should and so he probably experimented on himself-- all the successful procedures, at least, so he could survive the fallout, among other things. I suppose he expected his Creations to come back to kill him.\"\n\n\"... And how do you know all this again?\" You ask-- That\u0027s a pretty concise character study, actually.\n\n\"He was a substitute teacher for me once.\" She says quickly, giving you the hint that she won\u0027t say anymore about it, and that changing the subject is probably for the best.\n",
  "page 88": "The week passes by too soon for for your liking, but you and your compatriots can all agree that you got work done. You spent the week teaching the lesser-experienced Creations how to use their powers in battle, emphasizing team-work and effort. Like Kelso taught you, you passed on the knowledge of the power of emotion-- something you can vouch works in a fight. As the training went on it became rather obvious that in their human form, you can easily take on the strongest werewolf. In the real, bestial for, however, you have to use your wits. For that, you are forever thankful you are on the Wolves\u0027 good side. Heck, you\u0027re leading them to possible suicide.\n\nOther things you\u0027ve focused on is appealing to both Gideon and Ragnor, both people whom you know you can trust to some sort of degree.\n\nThe one thing you feel somewhat apologetic about is that you haven\u0027t been able to spend as much time with Cecilia as you wanted to, but you manage to remind yourself that if you succeed in taking over the City, you\u0027ll have all the time in the world. Perhaps, with enough time, you\u0027ll even learn the wolven-lingo, though it\u0027s the least of your worries currently.\n\nYou focus on the plan: it\u0027s basic espionage, like how a movie would set it out (though you can\u0027t remember any one in particular). They send a one-man army to the middle of the battlefield, while they storm the castle-walls. You\u0027re confident that you can take care of yourself, especially in the night-time, assuming that\u0027s when you\u0027re sent in.\n\nThe Creations stand together in a circle, well below the surface, waiting for the the scouting team (Ragnor\u0027s group) to tell you whether today is the day. While the Zealots begin their march to the Stronghold, the Creations will quickly get away, and run toward the city, attacking it while half of it\u0027s forces are trying to find the nonexistent. Time passes; you do this twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to see if they\u0027re preparing for a night-attack or not. You hope it\u0027s at night, as the Creations would have an advantage, probably. Additionally, you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about sun-tan lotion, the tube Kelso gave you will run out sooner or later. And so you wait, everybody around you waiting in silence.\n\nYou hear the codified knock: Clunk-clunk-clunk.\n\nThat\u0027s three times. Today isn\u0027t the day after all.\n\nYou go out to train once more, reviewing everything, and then turning back to refill on blood. Gideon gives you a broken plastic-cup with maybe an ounce of his blood. You drink it slowly, savoring the taste. It reinvigorates you, like usual, and you set down to meditate, waiting for nightfall.\n\nThat night...\n\nClunk-clunk-clunk-clunk\n\nThat\u0027s 4... Is tonight the night?\n\nRagnor\u0027s hooded head pokes out of the hatch, \"Come on, wake everybody. Now!\"\n\nGetting out of your trance, you begin repeatedly whispering, \"Now!\" as you went along, pulling off blankets from the Wolves. As with procedure, the Wolves spring into action, readying their clothes and going down, dividing themselves into the groups. Soon, the only Creations left are you (after ushering everybody out) and Gideon. \"Gideon, are you coming?\" You ask, concerned. You don\u0027t want to be late, after all.\n\nThe hunchback stares back at you solemnly, not speaking.\n\n\"Goddammit Gideon, let\u0027s go!\" You begin edging out of the room.\n\nHe opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again.\n\n\"Gideon, if you don\u0027t come with us, you\u0027ll die. We want you with us, so just... Come, man.\"\n\n\"You may have been right about the Church, Vamp. But it doesn\u0027t change a thing. The real monster is the Professor, not humanity. Hurting them is hurting us...\"\n\nYou shake your head in disbelief, before angrily waving him off. That hippie won\u0027t bring me down.\n\nWith haste, you make it to the well\u0027s opening, jumping off the walls to speedily catch up with Ragnor and the others. You were lucky they chose night-time, but that doesn\u0027t mean they didn\u0027t take advantage of it either. No flashes from miles ahead, just darkness, and maybe some slow movement here or there... But you only notice it if you squint. Crafty of them. \"Ragnor, you see them?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He says, calling out from ahead, \"But where\u0027s Gideon? He\u0027s supposed to be leading his group!\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that fool is coming.\" You spit out, finally catching up. \"But it\u0027s unimportant. David can lead them.\"\n\n\"David isn\u0027t exactly a leading-personality.\"\n\n\"He knows what he\u0027s doing.\"\n\n\"Which is why he should come with you! He\u0027d be much more useful by you than by us. We\u0027re just giving you time. We can have one of the other Wolves lead, but for now you will no doubt need help, and a former Zealot is just perfect.\"\n",
  "page 87": "\"Hey Vamp, take a seat.\" Ragnor calls out, waving you over to the off-kilter wooden bench he\u0027s sitting on. You comply; after several days and nights with barely any breaks, even sitting down to converse with the balding man who broke your Ghoul\u0027s neck sounds appealing. Plus, he can\u0027t exactly complain about not getting work done if he\u0027s taking a breather as well. If there\u0027s one thing you know about Ragnor, it\u0027s that he hates the Church more than anything. Except maybe the Professor; you\u0027ve never really talked with him that much, after all. The cloaked man smiles at you, and helps sit you down with a heavy hand clutching onto your shoulder. \"Hey man, I\u0027m really glad you joined us,\" he begins, taking his arm off of you and bringing it in front for a handshake; you respond in kind.\n\n\"Not as glad as I am to have joined.\" You laugh, releasing.\n\n\"Don\u0027t be so sure. It was getting rather stale, just hiding out in a bunker until we run out of food. You\u0027ve given us something to strive for.\"\n\n\"Fighting the Church?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He nods, pauses, then shows out his palms to you in a waving motion, \"I know, I know. Gideon\u0027s not exactly fond of it, but if it comes down to us and them, I vote us.\" Ragnor laughs. \"You know, the moment you said that the Church is planning to destroy us, I already was planning on trying to overthrow the city.\"\n\n\"You seemed very confident about it.\" You nod, rubbing at your chin, \"But why?\"\n\n\"So that we have a stronghold strong enough that we won\u0027t be able to be exterminated that easily. We\u0027re a small group, the Creations. And it\u0027s not exactly a growing population either, at best you can ghoul whatever, but we can\u0027t breed normally. It takes more time for it to work, you know...\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, amused, \"You\u0027ve tried?\"\n\n\"Ha, back when I was practically mind-controlled by the Professor, yeah. Heck, he probably tried things with you while you were unconscious, but who knows? Life before civilization fell was much different than now. The bastard wanted to create a new specie of man, and instead he got Hollywood monsters with bad skin conditions.\" He shrugs, \"But in some ways he succeeded, and I think that the Church shouldn\u0027t be allowed to hunt us down for it\u0027s own sake. There are some good kids in our pack, you know. Just honest-to-god decent kids that the Church wants to put down. It\u0027s not right.\"\n\n\"So what will you be doing if you suceed?\"\n\n\"Hunt down the Professor, definitely. The Church may be corrupt, but the root of the evil afflicted to the world spawned from that one man. After we end the Church in the nearby city, then we\u0027ll be able to be in charge.\"\n\n\"You seem confident that a couple of Creations can take on hundreds of Zealots.\"\n\nRagnor looks at you with a wry grin, \"You seem to be under a false-impression-- there really aren\u0027t that many Zealots. Can\u0027t be. The city they have is large, but only in comparison to other strongholds. Zealots are almost always male, if only because armor-fitting females is different, and they\u0027re probably sparse on metal. Plus, only able-bodied men can wield those huge-ass rifles. I\u0027d say they have 200 Zealots tops, and that\u0027s not including how many you\u0027ve just killed. Furthermore, they\u0027ll be divided while they march to our hideout and...\"\n\n\"That\u0027s still a lot.\"\n\nHe shrugs, \"As Wolves, we can shift either at will or automatically when stimulated luminescent orbs for some reason, into huge were-beasts. With proficiency, we can prove to be the fastest and most lethal things left on the planet. If, this week, we can train the kids to use their powers well, then it\u0027s definitely doable.\"\n\n\"You sure Gideon\u0027s okay with it?\" You ask, wondering whether you\u0027ll be joining him for sure,\n\n\"Regardless of what Gideon thinks about it, I won\u0027t be taking everybody with me, that\u0027s too much of a risk, and I doubt I could convince everybody, but...\"\n\nYou shrug, changing the subject, \"How experienced are you at your abilities?\"\n\n\"Enough.\"\n\n\"You think you can take me on?\" You ask, leaning forward and balancing your body on your palms.\n\n\"Maybe. I kind of figure the Vampire Creations were made in order to build foundations for the Professor. They can live forever, create progeny of sorts, etc. I have no idea how combat ready they are. Still, you\u0027re extremely resourceful, so I definitely hope you stick around. With your ghouling powers, we can create an entire civilization of Creations. Imagine how great that\u0027d be!\"\n\n\"I\u0027ll be honest, Ragnor; you didn\u0027t seem so cheery when I first met you.\"\n\n\"When you first met me I had to make a good impression.\" He laughs. \"Now, come on, we need to get back to training the cubs.\"\n",
  "page 119": "\"Ragnor,\" you hold your hand out defiantly, \"I can do just fine alone. I trust in David enough to know that he will aid you a lot in holding the fort than helping me on a stealth mission. Now come on.\"\n\nRagnor grunts in protest, but shrugs it off. You and the the rest of the Wolves, keeping your heads low, move around the incoming horde of Zealots, attacking the City on its other side, almost opposite from where the Zealots marched from. After an hour of movement, you\u0027re eyes manage to detect the sentries watching the City. There are only perhaps 6 in total, evenly spaced out in hexagonal circumference around the City, but they each handle a fierce strobe-light that will bring light to the actual situation. Thankfully, the group is just far enough away that you aren\u0027t spotted.\n\n\"So, do we have any good ideas on how I\u0027m getting in?\" You ask, your mind flipping through several theoretical simulations of getting into the City: most of them, you die.\n\n\"You see the narrow dark passage-way in between the strobe lights?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You have to slip through that, then quickly kill the sentry on this side before he can get to the other, and then climb the barb-wire fence. You\u0027ll have to figure out what to do from then, but I\u0027d focus on finding the actual Chapel, and killing the Elders there. We\u0027ll be rushing the City on this entire side while you\u0027re inside, confusing the Zealots and buying you time. Got it? Why the long face?\"\n\nYou hand him your rifle, \"Guess I can\u0027t exactly bring this with me, haha.\"\n\nHe takes it, smiles, and then salutes; this may be the last time you see him or several members of the group. You don\u0027t bother saying goodbye, and leave it to the hands of fate. \"Just take care of Cecilia and David.\" You say, turning around to slowly creep forward...\n\nFirst taking it slow, you almost crawl on the ground as to not be seen by the sentry, and move forward. You position yourself perfectly so the lights miss you, and the cloudy sky allows you to remain concealed. As you crawl onward, you notice that the Zealot Sentry is practically sleeping; he must have been here all day, waiting. Seizing the opportunity, you make easy work of him by bite. The defenseless man is quickly drained, to the point of being unconscious for reasons other than tiredness. You don\u0027t even bother checking whether his pulse is still there, whether he\u0027s dead or not doesn\u0027t matter right now. Finding the big Chapel does. You keep the strobe-light on as to not raise attention to anything, and continue on inside of the City. You leap over the fence, still clad in the Zealot armor. What you see in the City is amazing.\n\nNothing, almost a ghost-town. While the City has flashing banners all over, only two large buildings seem occupied: one with a giant cross, the other with an upside-down cross, like a sword.\n\nAs you enter the former, obviously the Chapel, you see an elderly man open the door in front of you. His squinty eyes stare at you for a moment before he asks in a gravely voice, \"Has my time come already?\"\n\nWordlessly, you grab at his throat, and begin to unintentionally rip at it, blood trickling down your wrist. \"You are the reason for my brethren\u0027s suffering.\" you start, your pupils widening in anger, \"You and your Zealots made us have to resort to living in fucking burrows. This is where God\u0027s plans for you ends, Tomas.\"\n\n\"Then so be it.\"\n\nHe dies there and then, and you find several monks staring at you in horror from the Chapel\u0027s door. Noticing them, you enter the Chapel to kill them as well. The balding priests hold out their necklaces, yelling, \"We shall fear no evil for there is God.\" Over and over again.\n\nThankfully, you aren\u0027t evil; you\u0027re just looking out for your race. Protecting it from those who want to cut down on it. The blood of the zealots tastes better than ever, but it gets cut short by the sudden blaring of sirens-- the assault has begun.\n\nYet, oddly, enough, over ten Zealots rush in from all sides come to gawk at your bloody attire. While you cackle evilly when jumping and clawing at them, they still manage to have you surrounded by numbers if nothing else, breathlessly ending your unlife with their bayonets, all in the name of their God.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 89": "You have talked with Ragnor at length on how you\u0027ll be running your operation on the City. What you both want to do is extremely difficult, even with the combined power of all the Wolves. The only chance you have is if the less-experienced Wolves learn from the best-- Gideon, Ragnor, and you. Not necessarily in that order either, since you have no idea what a werewolf is capable in full-form, nor do you know how you rank between them or even how they rank between each-other. Gideon is terrifyingly muscular, but Ragnor seems to be much faster. Any sparring matches you\u0027ve had with either seemed to be somewhat held-back, for whatever reason.\n\nStill, the main plan appears to be that, after some hand-picked scouts tell you three when the Zealots are coming, silently break through one of the cities defenses, and drop you in. While you cause mayhem inside the streets of the City, Gideon and Ragnor\u0027s two groups will be pushing through the City\u0027s walls, and fighting from in there. Supposedly the head of Church is an old man who runs the whole shebang, a certain, \u0027Father Tomas\u0027. Once you kill him, the Church will be extremely vulnerable. After that? Well, you just hope the humans don\u0027t continue resisting, otherwise it\u0027ll be a slaughter.\n\nAlthough you\u0027re going in by yourself (and maybe David, for ironic reasons), you\u0027re still tasked to help train the other Creations with Ragnor and Gideon. Over the days, what was probably most exciting\u0027 (aside from the shock of lovely Cecilia turning into a hulking were-wolf) part was your sparring match with Gideon. You can\u0027t help but feel both of you held back, however slightly, but it was likely of great education value to the other Creations.\n\n\n\"Alright Vampy, give it all you got.\"\n\nHa, worry about yourself.\n\nYou stand, parallel to Gideon, in a surprisingly flat part of the desert. The other Creations surround you both stripped down to nothing but basic shirt and pants, readying yourselves for an honest fight. As ugly of a creature Gideon is, he really is a mellow guy, which makes you almost not want to get into any scuffle with him, even if it\u0027s ust sparring. Still, you ready yourself to attack. You flick out your wrist, causing claws to edge out. The crescent moon lies above you both, and the hunchback chuckles as he slowly moves toward you, shuffling one foot through the sand at a time. You took your time as well, starting with a brisk walk, turning that momentum into a jog, then using that into all-out sprinting...\n\nGideon suddenly stops, and holds his hands out to block your advancing. When you reach him, you bring a clawed hand down, hoping to catch his shoulder; you succeed, though he remains unfazed, grabbing at your ankles while you deftly try to flip over him; that doesn\u0027t work. His palms squeeze at your feet, and he slams you onto the sand, using his weight to force you down. Thankfully, the rush of adrenaline, allows you to overpower him, throwing him off you. Once again parallel, he decides it\u0027s hsi turn to claw at you and he aims a long-winded at your gut-- your body twists, barely letting it hit, though allowing you to bring your elbow down to his neck.\n\nHe falls to the floor with a slump, though seems to quickly recover by holding you by his feet. You fall down as well, though you catch yourself with a roll, and get right back up. Gideon, however, gets up as Gideon no longer.\n\nIt was the first time you saw Gideon in his were-form. Massive, with a snout longer than an arm, silvery fangs almost as large as the L-bayonet itself, and white fur overlaying his entire body. You\u0027ve seen other werewolves turn, but it\u0027s obvious why Gideon is the alpha-wolf around here. While you marvel at the werewolf, he sends a massive fist to crash down on you-- but you quickly jump out of the way. Unsure what you can do, you turn to your own fangs; they aren\u0027t nearly as powerful as his, but they have other uses other than killing. Gideon continuously deals out attacks, and you manage to dodge nearly all of them, only a couple giving you scrapes. The Wolf leaps at you, waving all of it\u0027s bulking appendages in your direction. As it nears closer to you, you see an opening...\n\nYou took a leap of faith, catching Gideon in the neck with your own fangs. It was only the next morning when you woke, moved to the hideout once more.\n\n\"That was an epic fight.\" One of the teen-wolves say, glaring at you in awe. Gideon was to the side of your bed, sitting up and laughing.\n\n\"Very good, Vampy. Nice use of your abilities, those fangs exhaust people way easy, even those pumped up on canine-adrenaline. Crazy effective. You hear that, Wolves? Someone who knows the full-outset of their abilities is a dangerous fellow.\"\n\n\nAnd that\u0027s how you remember it. Even though Gideon helped train the Wolves to fight, you worry about him. He doesn\u0027t seem too enthusiastic about taking over the city. Hopefully he changes his mind soon...\n",
  "page 80": "You sigh, somewhat content with the ability to choose for your group. \"I agree with Gideon-- defending is probably the best option. After all, the humans... Even if they hate us, they aren\u0027t our real enemy right now.\" Gideon grins, and slaps you on the back. Ragnor shrugs, and heads to a splintered cabinet in the back of the room. He comes back with several cans, accurately labeled as \u0027beer\u0027. With a grin, he begins handing them out to the \u0027adults\u0027 in the room and you. \"Rest on the floor, Vamp. Today is a day of celebration, a joiner to our brood!\"\n\nWith some large chants, Ragnor clicks open the can, and begins handing it to you. As you reach to take it, he immediately withdraws it. He lays it on the floor in front of you, then proceeds to bring a clawed index finger to his wrist above the can, poking deeply into it and letting blood slowly drip into the can.\n\n\"Hah, I forgot you can\u0027t really taste anything but blood. Don\u0027t worry though, this\u0027ll get you high on no one\u0027s expense, Vamp, enjoy yourself.\"\n\nYou laugh, scratching at your head for forgetting. You accept the bloody beer; while it\u0027s nothing compared to full blood, it\u0027s the most happy you\u0027ve been since you got out of the Facility. It\u0027s nice to be part of a family. You and the rest of the Creations laugh and discuss the \u0027happenings\u0027 of the current world. You can\u0027t add much, but the leaders of the Wolves\u0027 collective stories are fascinating in their own rights, though. On top of it all, you think you\u0027ve really hit it off with Cecilia-- the blonde Wolf.\n\n\nThe next couple of days fly by...\n",
  "page 82": "\"I... Think Ragnor has a solid point. We can definitely beat the Zealots as long as we have the element of surprise. And if this goes well, then we won\u0027t have to worry about extinction ever again.\"\n\nThe blonde vixen looks up to you, as do most of the Wolves. Ragnor laughs, and pats you on the back. Gideon, on the other hand, merely frowns, closes his eyes, and announces, \"Right. Welcome to the family, Vampy. I\u0027d rest, we\u0027re all practically nocturnal here anyhow.\n\nThe cloaked Ragnor frowns, \"Are you sure? I was just about to bring out the alcohol...\"\n\n\"No alcohol, Ragnor. We have a long night tonight, lots of training we need to go through. I don\u0027t think some of us here have actually fought Zealots.\"\n\nRagnor nods, and the rest of the Wolves shuffle back to their blankets. Gideon shuts the lantern off, and heads down the hatch, disappearing after a thud.\n\nMeanwhile, you find a piece of concrete that is comfortable enough to meditate on, and begin to close your eyes... Only to realize that all the Wolves are watching you for some reason. They\u0027re all smiling, and the pretty one in particular seems to watch you in the dark of day. At some point during the night, she leans towards you to whispers, \"Hi, I\u0027m Cecilia.\" She giggles.\n\n\"Uh, hi.\" You whisper back lamely.\n\n\nThe next couple of days fly by, and you manage to go over the histories of your new friends, as well as prepare them for the fight.\n",

  "page 84": "The next week involved quite a bit of socializing and preparation for the big day. Night by night you trained, and although the week didn\u0027t give you as much time as you wanted, it gave you enough to get a feel for the Wolves, make a start with the community, and most importantly, teach the young ones how to harness their frustration into power. Power, that will hopefully be enough to block the Zealots off, and beat them by matter of attrition.\n\nYou feel as though you\u0027ve gotten on pretty good terms with both Gideon and Ragnor, both of whom are simply great guys. You\u0027ve noticed that, despite their differing ideologies, they have utmost respect for each-other, which is rather pleasant to see. Something that always lay at the back of your mind, though, was that Ragnor claimed that he was going to raid the City, regardless of what choice the group took, but you never understood that. How was he going to do that without support?\n\nStill, the only thing you really feel sad about is the lack of time you were able to have with Cecilia. Even though you\u0027ve trained together, you really wish you could have talked to her more often, about things other than unleashing her concealed persona: the werewolf. But, you manage to keep yourself jovial enough knowing that if you succeed at stopping the Zealot onslaught, you\u0027ll have all the time in the world with your new love. Additionally, you might even be able to learn how to read the mysterious hieroglyphs when times of peace are near.\n\nBright lights ahead, but you just have to reach it.\n\nAs the week passes, you all begin sitting in a circle daily, discussing the plan thoroughly, and then send out scouts to see if the Zealots are sending their men to raid your headquarters. The plan is simple; when you are alerted of the Zealot present, you will block off the entrance with any object available, then hide in secluded corners in the dark maze that is the well, and slowly pick off the Zealots as they pass.\n\nToday is one of those days, and you are warily waiting for the knock from the scouts. Any day now, the Zealots should be coming. Time passes; you do this twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to see if they\u0027re preparing for a night-attack or not. You hope it\u0027s at night, as the Creations would have an advantage, probably. Additionally, you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about sun-tan lotion, the tube Kelso gave you will run out sooner or later. And so you wait, everybody around you waiting in silence.\n\nYou hear the codified knock: Clunk-clunk-clunk.\n\nSomeone lets out a sigh-- today isn\u0027t the day.\n\nYou go out to train once more, reviewing everything, and then turning back to refill on blood. Gideon gives you a broken plastic-cup with maybe an ounce of his blood. You drink it slowly, savoring the taste. It reinvigorates you, like usual, and you set down to meditate, waiting for nightfall.\n\nThat night...\n\nClunk-clunk-clunk-clunk\n\nThat\u0027s 4... Is tonight the night?\n\nRagnor\u0027s head poking out of the hatch confirms it, \"Everybody, wake up, now!\" Hearing this everybody assembles, bringing out spare Zealot armors and weapons. Indeed, even you\u0027re surprised by their efficiency tonight.\n\n\"Alright Wolves, tonight, we defend our home!\" You announce, pumping your fist.\n\nHowever, unlike most of your announcements, nobody but Gideon roars in applause. Ragnor approaches you with a laugh, \"Sorry bud, I think we\u0027re making ourselves a new home, tonight.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" You look around and it seems obvious that everybody but you and Gideon know what\u0027s going on.\n\nCecilia turns to you with a frown, \"Sorry, love... but I can\u0027t live in this shit-hole any longer. I just... think it\u0027s time we took a stand. You understand, right?\"\n\nGideon moves into the fray, sticking his finger into the taller man\u0027s chest, \"What do you think you\u0027re doing, Ragnor? We, deh group, made a decision!\"\n\nRagnor stares back at the hunchback, \"Yes, and I made a re-vote, without the peer pressure the group is used to. Turns out, they trust the Church much less than you do, and think that surviving well is better than just surviving, uncertain if they\u0027ll get a next meal. We can be the new Human-race: \u0027Homo-Creatio,\u0027 us, the Wolves, Gideon. Think about it!\"\n\nGideon just spits in disgust, \"You fool! This is NOT how we\u0027re supposed to get continue! Ragnor, the humans \"aren\u0027t much worse than we are, for there outlook is for survival as well. We can merge with them after showing how similar we are by not slaughtering them in their City!\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t think so, friend. But if I were either of you, I\u0027d join us for survival\u0027s sake only, no way can you survive the oncoming Zealots. I saw them-- several groups of ten and covering ground right now. It\u0027s either join us or meet your doom.\"\n\nYou look at Gideon, and his dark eyes just blink out, \"Don\u0027t.\"\n\n\nWhat it comes to, in the end, is whether you wish to join Ragnor and the rest to assault the city or stay by Gideon, alone and at the mercy of the incoming horde.\n",

Don\u0027t worry though, this\u0027ll get you high on no one\u0027s expense, Vamp, enjoy yourself.\"\n\nYou laugh, scratching at your head for forgetting. You accept the bloody beer; while it\u0027s nothing compared to full blood, it\u0027s the most happy you\u0027ve been since you got out of the Facility. It\u0027s nice to be part of a family. You and the rest of the Creations laugh and discuss the \u0027happenings\u0027 of the current world. You can\u0027t add much, but the leaders of the Wolves\u0027 collective stories are fascinating in their own rights, though. On top of it all, you think you\u0027ve really hit it off with Cecilia-- the blonde Wolf.\n\n\nThe next couple of days fly by...\n",
  "page 86": "Hours pass quicker than you\u0027d want during the training sessions. You\u0027ve realized that the Wolves are powerful, but undisciplined, almost childish at times. But at the end of the night, you got work done. Yet, even after the night passes, Gideon routinely goes under the hatch. You\u0027ve tried to peek at him, in interest of what he does when alone, but it brings no more results than asking around; zilch. But on one of those times you spend upside down, silently hanging from the hatch, Gideon turns around to acknowledge you.\n\nThe hunchbacked leader stares back at you with cold eyes, \"What do you want, lad? You think it\u0027s possible I really do just like sitting down here, alone?\"\n\nShocked, you suddenly lose your grip; only to land upright, as a cat would. \"I, uh, maybe. But I\u0027ve asked around, and people wonder about you, as I do. You\u0027re very... Silent, for a leader.\"\n\nHe laughs, \"Leader? Hah, that\u0027s good, Vampire. I just do the heavy work, as always. Keeping watch is one of my duties.\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t put yourself down, Gideon. You seem to know what you\u0027re doing.\" You say, unsure how to respond to his glumness.\n\n\"Vamp, the camp here believes you-- and that\u0027s fine by me, I\u0027ll be honest and say I trust you too, but the fact that we\u0027ll be fighting the Church isn\u0027t a good thing, regardless of the rewards.\"\n\n\"Like our lives?\"\n\n\"You\u0027re young and timeless, so it\u0027s not something you can really sympathize with.\" Gideon snorts, \"No offense, Vamp.\"\n\n\"None taken, but what do you mean?\" You say, letting him continue.\n\n \"I don\u0027t think you really get what the Church is. I mean, I don\u0027t think anybody here does. Even Ragnor, he\u0027s blinded by rage and fury. He believes that the Church needs to be destroyed for the betterment of everyone, especially us. But...\"\n\n\"But what?\" By now you\u0027re getting a bit agitated at Gideon for being so ambiguous.\n\nHe turns his face away, \"But he\u0027s dead wrong about it. Almost all of us here remember the treatments the Professor gave us. To say the least, you\u0027re lucky to have forgotten most, if not all of them. That man just bred hatred, even more than the religious back in the day.\" A pause. \"He hurt us all, in so many ways. But worse yet, he made us hurt others. It started with killing evil, but then came to killing innocents, the only food-source left for us. And we followed him through fire and water, that man. Kurschner represented our hopes and dreams, true power for a true purpose. But he lied to us, and used us for himself, experimented with us, made sure our past lives weren\u0027t there so that there was nothing for us to go back to. Even I don\u0027t remember too much of what was before I became a Wolf. The dreams stop after you get comfortable in your form.\"\n\nThe older gentlemen continues, \"By the way, are you still dreaming?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" You begin to realize that you indeed have stopped dreaming since you joined, \"No, I rest much better now.\"\n\nHe frowns in return, \"Best not get too comfortable here, then. Those dreams are your only way to know what is really going on.\"\n\n\"Which also reminds me, did you have somebody help you get out of the Facility before it was burnt down?\"\n\n\"Err, yes.\" You nervously answer.\n\n\"Did he have a name?\"\n\n\"Kelso.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Ahem, uh, Kelso.\" You repeat, slower this time. \"He said he knew you. Also mentioned a fellow named Stein.\"\n\nGideon bites his lip, \"Never met a fellow named Kelso. Did he say anything else?\"\n\n\"He mentioned being tasked with watching the Lesser Creations, along with several other elites.\"\n\n\"That explains it, though I can\u0027t say I know who he is under his new pseudo-name. I wonder where he is now...\"\n\n\"I wish I knew, \" you say, longingly, \"he said he\u0027d come back at some point, he was searching for the Professor.\"\n\n\"As do we all.\" Gideon says, closing his eyes, \"Simon Kurschner was one evil, however brilliant man. A lot of our older members ran out in hopes to hunt him down, though they never returned...\"\n",
  "page 85": "\"Cecilia, please stop it.\" You say, pushing her off you. Thinking it through, it probably wasn\u0027t the best idea for you to personally trainer of the woman with mutual, though perhaps repressed for the moment, feelings for you. Regardless, she seems a bit too happy when she get close-and-personal with you during a sparring match. With a sigh, you look over to Ragnor and Gideon\u0027s respective groups-- it was a smart way the three of you ended up dividing the workload. Each of you would take 4 of the Wolves and personally trained them to defend themselves. Perhaps they gave you too much credit-- you\u0027re not a hundred percent sure what to do. Kelso was the one who taught you, but he seemed to recognize that berserking was the way you could unleash your full strength. You\u0027ll have to figure out how the Wolves were designed to fight, soon. On the plus side, you\u0027re very happy with you \u0027students\u0027, to the point that the names stick out in your mind. Shamino is a heavy-hitter, though surprisingly clumsy for one of his set stature; Haran is extremely agile, and almost vampire-like when it comes to fighting; and Cecilia, is, well, Cecilia.\n\n\"So, group, have any of you ever shifted into your were-forms?\" You ask, gathering your group outside the dunes. In the dark of night, the flat land of sand that you found might seem unimpressive, but the fact that\u0027s it\u0027s mostly flat is more rare than one would think here; the landscape is usually riddled with smaller hills evrywhere.\n\n\"Not me.\" Haran says raising his hand, \"Ragnor said that we\u0027ll turn only if our bodies deem it necessary. Or when there\u0027s a ball of light, but the moon isn\u0027t round tonight.\"\n\nAs the rest of the Wolves nod, you rub your chin in thought. \"David!\" You call, waving to your ghoul, who is walking around, aimlessly for whatever reason. \"Can you bring one of the L-Bayonets?\" He nods in response, and wanders back the to Stronghold.\n\n\"What do you want with the.. the guns?\" The young Shamino asks, looking frightened. The other two Wolves seem to look disturbed as well,\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry haha. We need to train your fortitude as well as make sure you master your abilities. From what it seems, you haven\u0027t done either.\" You watch them idly, waiting for David to bring the gun. As much as it may pain you, you\u0027ll need to see what the electronic bolt will do to them. If all goes well, they\u0027ll be forced to morph. And only then can you get started...\n\n\"You want to force us to morph for you.\" Cecilia states, frowning.\n\n\"Not for me, for you.\" You emphasize with a nod, \"The way learned to fight was when I had to unleash my primal being, but still pay close attention to my abilities and skills. If you want to defend against the the Zealots, then we need to see you morph.\"\n\nThey all gulp, but nod confidently. When David returns  with the rifle, you firmly grasp it and prop it up, \"This,\" you shake it as as to bring it at attention, \"is the Zealots primary weapon. The tusks at the end are sharp, and will probably pierce nearly any type of hide. Still, assuming you have any sort of health-regeneration abilities, that shouldn\u0027t be a problem. What will be a problem, however, is what this rifle shoots out. Lightning.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nYou clap, \"So, who wants to see who can handle the \u0027holy\u0027 firepower?\" To your surprise, both Cecilia and Shamino raise heir hands fairly quickly. Even though you\u0027re pretty sure Cecilia raised her hand first, you aim the gun in then big Asian\u0027s direction, \"Shamino, you ready?\"\n\nHe nods, bracing himself as his team-mates slowly back away from him.\n\nYou unleash the shot, it\u0027s force even taking you off guard as it erupts out of the rifle\u0027s end. The green-blue bolt reaches poor Shamino almost instantaneously, flinging him several feet in the air and into the sand, causing a small sand-mound of his own. You and the rest run to catch up to him, hoping he\u0027s alright.\n\nWhat you see isn\u0027t necessarily \u0027alright\u0027, per se, but it\u0027s what you wanted to see. What was a powerful Asian teenager is now a hulking, barely conscious furry monster. As it gets up, the snarling beast (about twice your height and thrice your width) begins sniffing around, it\u0027s eyes fully white. It\u0027s nose beckons in your direction before it lets out a horrible cry-- a howl. As your two students begin to run and David passively watches from afar, you find yourself at the mercy of Shamino the Werewolf. It starts towards you, walking on two feet and using it\u0027s other limbs to claw in your direction. While the beast begins it\u0027s charge, you take the initiative by jumping at it yourself,using the rifle\u0027s tusks as a range advantage. You stick the horns into the werewolf, though you\u0027re not surprised that it doesn\u0027t do much to slow it down. By now it has it\u0027s oversized arms around  you, crushing your body...\n\nClick\n\nA bolt of lightning shoots out, straight into the werewolf\u0027s stomach. More sticky blood oozes from its stomach, and ith a growl the beast releases you, if only to take the gun out from between its ribs. Once again taking the initiative, you send a slamming claw to it\u0027s snout, and follow up with a kick to its already bleeding midsection. While it pushes it back, it doesn\u0027t seem to do as much as you\u0027d hoped. It takes the bayonet and uses it like a bat to hit you, leaving you breathless as you are flung into the sky, the heavy gun landing on-top of you. You cough out blood, and get up to analyze the situation: Ragnor and Gideon\u0027s groups have stopped training just to watch while David, Haran and Cecilia finally get into action. You run to catch up with them, and the unfolding scene would make you tear if you could; the three of them coordinate with each-other beautifully, with Haran both dodging the werewolf\u0027s blows and throwing sand at its eyes in order to occupy it, while the other tackle at it\u0027s heavy feet, just managing to trip it, and keep it there. It\u0027s not the greatest way to end a fight, but it\u0027s good teamwork.\n\nBy the time you reach them, Shamino is in his regular form, bleeding only slightly from his nose. He seems oblivious as to what happened, but you\u0027re excited team-mates are more than happy to fill him in. Several more lessons like this, and they\u0027ll be more than ready to fight the Zealots. After all, taking down a werewolf is much easier than a human.\n",
  "page 240": "\"Oh, right!\" Alice exclaims taping her forehead. \"I... really don\u0027t know what to do about that. I don\u0027t think I can give you as much as you\u0027ll need...\"\n\nYou once again notice her off-hand, covered in red bandages barely covered by a sleeve, \"Yeah... To make matters worse, I think the stimulation of being around humans triggers my... Hunger.\"\n\nAlice rubs her chin in thought, \"Do you think you can eat animal-meat?\"\n\n\"I\u0027d assume only raw, but I think you somehow know more than I do. I\u0027m not even sure what would happen if I ate anything but human flesh and blood. I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve tried...\"\n\n\"Hmm, follow me.\" Grabbing at your wrist, she leads you into a small but tidy kitchen. Opening up several cabinets she takes out chocolate chips, ground coffee beans, potato chips, and an apple-- all of which seem to be in low supply. \"Try these, I suppose.\"\n\nHesitantly, you grasp the plump red apple in your hand and sink your teeth into it. Almost immediately, you are overcome with a feeling of disgust, as if somebody jsut fed you warm rubber. Refelexively you gag, spitting the apple out onto the floor, making an awful mess.\n\nAlice frowns, but motions for you to continue. Maybe something salty?\n\nYou reach for the potato chips, taking our one chip and eating it.\n\nOnce again, you find yourself spitting out the abhorrent crud. \"Agh, sorry about that... I really don\u0027t get why I can\u0027t stomach these foods.\"\n\nAlice bites her lip, taking away everything but the coffee-grinds. \"No, don\u0027t worry about it. Try the coffee-- I\u0027m hoping distinct tastes can curb your appetite.\"\n\nSlowly, you grab for some of the coffee, and loosely sprinkle it on your tongue.\n\nAfter moments of anticipation, Alice speaks up, \"So, how is it?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s...\" you chew, not really sure what to make of the taste, \"Edible, I guess. Not something I think I can eat on a regular basis, though.\"\n\n\"But it\u0027s a start!\" She answers, cheerfully.\n\nThat it is... You smile back.\n",

  "page 120": "You slowly begin making your way up and to the right-side, in the direction of the Wolves\u0027 actual hideout. What starts off as a slow walk turns into full-blown running on the cool desert sand. You breathe in the air, and then out. Despite the recent turn of events, you feel absolutely wonderful; though that feeling is soon changed into a horrific one. You suddenly sense your body being pulled back by some sort of shocking force, and then your bleary eyes only make out another cool-blue room.\n\nDifference is, there are several others in the room, all in masks. You try to move, but your entire body seems to be restrained by a cold metal, and your face is covered by some sort of hazy mask and...\n\nIs that a scalpel!?!?\n\nThe Father\u0027s voice rings out, \"See, the funny thing is, you never really had a choice in helping us. In the end, God always opens up ways for his sheep to wander, and always closes the gates on the bad wolves. I had plans to make use of you regardless of whether you actually meant repentance.\"\n\nThough it\u0027s a slow and dull process, you feel your life-energy slowly being sucked out. Even if you could probably survive much longer, you slowly realize that survival is what they want, so they could continue examining your body and organs for whatever purposes and rituals the Zealots want. Soon, your spirit leaves your body, and you feel yourself die on the hospital bed.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",

You know that I want to find the Professor and you say his name is Kurschner, right?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"How am I going to be able to find him?\"\n\n\"Database, I think I already mentioned that. The lab\u0027s computers have a lot of information regarding the experiments, like you and who made them. Maybe if we are able to scrounge up a picture of Kurschner it\u0027ll jog your memory.\"\n\n\"Cool, I guess. Uh, that\u0027s it then.\" You respond, unsure what else should be stated. It\u0027s late, after all, and there certainly is a lot to sleep on.\n\n\"Yes, I think we can make this work. I hope. We still need to work out what to do with your skin-- sunscreen is the last thing we\u0027ve been worrying about. But everything else...\"\n\n\"Right,\" you nod, \"but how am I going to be introduced?\"\n\n\"Well, it\u0027s up to you. You can join me by the grocery-- need to pick up the monthly rations, or you can go to the Zaloon. Temperance is promoted, but Tomas thought it\u0027d be cruel to not let people get sloshed during such tough times. Both of those places are good places to show your face around, though I personally stay away from the pub-- too many men.\" She continues to giggle.\n\n\"Good to know. Which one do you think will have Tomas notified sooner?\"\n\n\"Well, he\u0027d know either way, but the saloon has a lot of the Zealot-grunts-- the soldiers which are allowed liquor, who will report back to base with the news pretty quickly. But at least there you can probably make a better impression than just picking up groceries, though less subtle.\"\n\nYou nod, trying to give as warm of a smile as you can, \"Thanks Alice, for everything. I think I\u0027ll sleep on it and figure it out tomorrow.\"\n\n\"No problem!\" She replies with a mischievous grin. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, Vamp.\"\n\nYou laugh goodbye, closing the door after a long day. Crazy day, huh. Vamp... Would be a fun nickname if it wasn\u0027t so obvious...\n\nWhile you can\u0027t actually go to sleep (voluntarily, at least) you are able to get into a sort of meditative state, where your mind relaxes and you are able to feel reinvigorated.\n\nOf course, even that form of bliss comes to an end when the chunky Zadok slaps you awake.\n\n\"Morning, sunshine. Glad you made yourself at home, man, but you need to get up.\"\n\nAlmost immediately, you bolt right up, \"Yeah, I\u0027m up. Where\u0027d you go last night?\"\n\n\"The Father called us up for more late night searching. A friend of ours-- Sebastian went missing just around the time you came. But don\u0027t worry, I didn\u0027t tell Father Tomas anything just yet. We can\u0027t just keep you here forever, but I think it\u0027s up to you to decide when to come out.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s great, Zadok.\" You say back, \"I\u0027m actually planning to go outside today.\"\n\n\"Go out where?\" He asks with a confused expression.\n\n\"Uh, either to the groceries with Alice or to the pub. She said that I should start becoming a \u0027citizen\u0027 or something.\"\n\n\"Hey man, that\u0027s great!\" The man exclaims, clasping his meaty palms together, \"I mean, if you still want I can take you to Father Tomas straight, maybe even make a soldier outta you, but either way works fine. Which reminds me-- what happen to your armor? I wanted to take a look at it again, in case we can find out if it\u0027s Sebastian\u0027s. Poor guy, no clue where he could be...\"\n\nDid-- did I kill Sebastian? You begin to stutter out a response, until you realize that you yourself don\u0027t know where the armor went. That Alice...\n\n\"No clue where it went. That\u0027s odd, Zadok... But I was resting for a while there, so I have no idea where it could have went.\"\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll ask Alice later- but hey, I have a meeting with the Father in half an hour, so you can come if you changed your mind.\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t know... Alice didn\u0027t seem too keen on it, so I told her I wouldn\u0027t.\"\n\nZadok considers it, \"Nah, don\u0027t freak out poor Alice. Stick to your promises and whatnot. Anyway, where are you gonna end up going? Curious.\"\n",
  "page 6": "Out of nowhere, a humanoid with flashy armor leaps at you. Fearful, you quickly send out a powerful jab, lamely clunking on his armor as he topples on top of you. You expect him to attack, or continue the assault, but he appears to be as dazed you are. Although the metal armor is heavy, you\u0027re able to throw him off of yourself, hearing a splintering in the wooden floor as he lands.\n\n\"I\u0027m here.\"\n\nIt\u0027s Kelso. His striking features resemble an older gentleman. Whitish blonde hair and a gruff voice, though perhaps with a slight German accent-- almost grandfather-like. \"Master, where were you? What... is this man doing here?\"\n\n\"C.E. Agent, member of the Church and Special-Forces Unit for taking care of our kind. You need to kill this filth.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, \"What? I dunno...

Lord in heaven, the damned speak!\"\n\nYou can imagine his eyes would be widening right about now, but his entire body is covered in the metal suit, flashing with electric blue lining, his helmet with a black visor. The figure, now up, begins to scramble for a rifle-like object, but Kelso gives a heavy slap to the back of his head, sending the man flying forward, his helmet flying off in a different direction.\n\n\"Kelso, Creations? What the hell is going on? Tell me!\"\n\n\"First, kill him.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m really not sure about this...\"\n\n\"Kid, I know you\u0027re hungry.\" It\u0027s true. \"This is the only thing you can feast on.\"\n\nYou just stare in disbelief, shaking your head. Kelso stares at you for a moment before turning around and kicking the operative in the side. You hear a dent and a crack, likely his ribs were smashed along with his armor.\n\n\"Let\u0027s get your questions over with. Now. You need to decide what you\u0027ll do with him.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, just shocked at everything that\u0027s transpiring.

  "page 145": "With the alarms already blaring you make sure not to waste time in getting out of the building and into the Church. Outside, swarms of Zealots are coming out of the Church\u0027s front doors, obviously en route to fight Ragnor and his Wolves. You and David mostly blend in enough to not be recognized as anything but Zealots and manage to swim past the incoming horde and through the next street, then up the concrete steps of the Church and right in front of the Chapel\u0027s gates..\n\n\"How should we enter, then?\"\n\n\"No backdoors to the Church. Only one direction if you follow God.\" David recites from behind you.\n\nYou consider trying to bash the door in, but decide that knocking it and waiting for the door to be opened by whoever\u0027s inside would be an easier solution for getting in.\n\nClang\n\nYour gauntlet taps at the metal. After a pause, you can hear noises on the inside of the Chapel, mostly worried murmuring. You quickly motion for David to go in front, right before a bald young man in ceremonial blue robe opens the door. In response to your ghoul\u0027s profile, the man just gapes for several moments before opening his mouth to speak. \"Dave?!?\"\n\n\"No... Not anymore.\" He states, walking into the Church. The man doesn\u0027t seem to even notice you, engrossed in seeing a living ghost instead. Inside, several other monks are gathered, all of them staring at David with awe. You take the opportunity to slink into the shadow, and wait.\n\n\"Behold! The blessed Lord brought our child back!\" They cry, waving their hands in the air in synchronization. Up and down their hands go, until one with a cowl speaks up, \"Brother David, where were you?\"\n\nYour ghoul stares at them with disdain, \"I got lost, but was found by a group of humans.\"\n\nThey continue to gape. The cowled-one continues his interrogation, \"Hmm? More humans, you say?\n\n\"Crazy enough, the humans were in our backyard this entire time. We just didn\u0027t recognize them.\"\n\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"The Wolves, Vadim. They\u0027re good people.\"\n\nGasps erupt, and David\u0027s only looks down to his feet, and his hands ball up to fists. \"They changed you, didn\u0027t they?\" The one with the cowl points, and begins to chant in some sort of language which you are unfamiliar with.\n\nBored of their religious, antics, you make your presence known by jumping out of the shadows, and decking \u0027Vadim\u0027 with a right hook, sending him to the middle of the crowd of twelve-or-so Monks. David nods, and sends a sharp kick to the nearest Zealot surrounding him. Before you know it, it becomes a rowdy brawl of fists.\n\nThe monks may be very agile, but without any weapons nor armor you figure you or even David could take them out alone.\n",
  "page 266": "Nervously, you stand from your chair; the others following suit. \"Shall I leave for the rest of the night then, to return in the morning?\"\n\n\"No,\" The Father states, still cackling. \"You\u0027ll study under me, and as such you are never to leave without my permission.

Ooh, and send for one of the \u0027scientists\u0027, it\u0027ll be needed.\"\n\n\"The raid? Scientist?\" You ask, baffled.\n\nZadok merely nods, leaving you alone with the psychotic holy-man. Tomas turns to the wall behind his desk, tapping at it with slender aged finger-- tap tap tap.\n\nThe wall suddenly shifts, opening up a room bright with light-- the walls patterned with white and sky blue coloring. The sound of grinding gears comes to an abrupt stop when you enter the room, only to resume for the wall to shift back. The room is simply shockingly bright, and you feel almost powerless from the lights shining above you.\n\n\"UV-lights, Vampire. It\u0027s almost too coincidental that they accidentally wired this extra office with those types of lights, only a couple of weeks ago! God is certainly looking out for me, eh?\"\n\n\"Eh.\" You state, mustering up the strength to walk straight.\n\nTomas claps twice-- turning the lights off, then another clap to turn a different lighting on. This one, while brighter, didn\u0027t disorient you, at least. \"Now, Vampire, we\u0027re going to get things straight. You don\u0027t deserve to atone, which is simply why I can\u0027t vouch for what happens when you will finally be at peace. However, I can say that at the very least you may find peace if this works, if you follow my commands and fulfill your duty as a Zealot. Understood?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tomas.\"\n\n\"Father Tomas, heathen. You\u0027re lucky Zadok vouched for you-- the damned Zealot values honesty above other virtues, but it is simply not enough to get past the fires of Michael and into the gates of the Lord.\"\n\nAfter further berating you, with you being complacent through it out, he begins going over the Zealot code--\n\n\"Honor means nothing if it isn\u0027t for the Lord.\"\n\n\"Honesty with God should not cause you to be shamed before others.\"\n\n\"Murder is justified only through a a high calling.\"\n\nAmong other generic laws regarding personal holiness and lawfulness. What comes next, however, surprises you.\n\n\"The Zealot code means NOTHING for you. You abominations don\u0027t hold by this. You will need to serve as God\u0027s unholy hand, the Shade to my Soloman.\" He pauses,\n\n\"Now, feast upon this man\u0027s flesh.\"\n\nAs you hear the horrible cranking of gears once again, a man is pushed by masked Zealots through the shifted door, his face sweaty and flustered. He is a rather round young adult, though not to a disgusting measure. He\u0027s simply chubby, like a fully grown cherub who just flew several miles non-stop. It\u0027d be almost cute if your stomach didn\u0027t begin to act up. Your mouth begins to water, however slightly...\n\nThe wall shifts back, and you glare at Tomas, pained at the thought of ripping into another human being again. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me...\"\n\n\"I kid you not, Zealot. You are of a demon\u0027s kind-- embrace it, now, show me your true colors!\"\n\nIs this some sort of trick? Bastard... What the hell does he want from me?\n\nThe chubby man stares at you with a pitiful frown. He doesn\u0027t say anything, though from his expression it definitely doesn\u0027t seem like he\u0027s happy. A tear flutters down to the ground and onto the man\u0027s bare foot, and the man soon falls to his knees, begging inaudibly.\n\nThe Father just stares at you, expectantly.\n",
  "page 5": "\"Agh...\"\n\nYou continuously rub your eyes, trying to ease the pain. After several moments, the stinging lessens and your eyes open to see your hands paler than ever. Another oddity; your forehead is boiling, you can feel it as a faint heat, this must be the most blood contained in one point of your body since you awoke.\n\nIt\u0027s bizarre, but the situation is hilarious to you: the reason for only moving outside at night is because of sunburns. It\u0027s ridiculous, why would someone waste his time creating a useless being? Was there even an actual goal with you being tampered with?\n\nAs your thought process grows along with your annoyance at Kelso\u0027s reluctance to explain, you hear a sudden tapping. Then a crash, like a glass vase fell.\n\nInstinctively, your cold body tenses. And while your forehead must be a beaming red in contrast to your albino exterior, your eyes see fine now as you try to find the source of the breakage.\n\nInstinctively, your cold body tenses.

I\u0027ve explained this before.\"\n\nHe sort of did, but it doesn\u0027t exactly make it better. He told you that you couldn\u0027t digest any food, but he never mentioned you\u0027d have to digest blood!\n\n\"I... I drink his blood... from the neck?\" Your knowledge about supernatural creatures is more or less non-existent, give or take whatever nerdy things you might have dabbled in high-school. Unless you were some sort of jock before then. You don\u0027t remember...\n\n\"Not necessarily. The wrist works too-- as long as you get a stream of blood in your mouth you\u0027ll be satiated. This should be easier as things go along though, since any sort of infirmary should have some blood packs for transfusions, and those are easily broken into. And you can always drink non-human blood... But this is necessary. Oh, and do remember to watch out for the diseased, bad blood isn\u0027t good for yor system.\"\n\n\"Ugh... Do we really have to kill him?\" You ask with a frown.\n\n\"Unless you want him to call upon the rest of the C.E. Crew on our asses, then yes. Either way, you need to be full before we leave this shit hole. We have work to do.\"\n",
  "page 147": "You make your way outside of the building shaken but undeterred. The streets are empty, but you know that there are more humans in the houses, hiding. While the fighting itself may be dying down, you feel the need to go out and meet your courageous brethren, rather than have them come for you. You run down the steps and onto the concrete street, continuing back from where you came from, meanwhile trying to shove away distracting thoughts of your deceased friend. When this is done, we will honor you properly...\n\nEventually, you begin to notice armored corpses strewn about in awkward positions. Alternatively, you find a brown Wolf, whom you recognize as the Middle-eastern man, white-eyed and bloody by a curb. How many of us were lost this day?\n\nYou continue on in solemn silence when you reach the fence, and from beyond it you can see several more Wolven corpses. Frantically, you search for Cecilia-- Phew, none of them are blonde like she was. But still... This leaves perhaps eight of us left... Most likely the last of our kind.\n\n\"Vamp!\" Comes a cry behind you. You turn around quickly to be hugged by an especially warm Cecilia, with Ragnor smiling with glee. You return the embrace, happiness overcoming the previous thoughts of dread.\n\n\"I\u0027m glad to see your alright, man. We had a tough fight, but we fended the hordes of Zealots off. How did your fights go?\"\n\nYou nod, \"We... We killed Tomas and- and a man named Karat, called himself \u0027Chief\u0027.  Either way, the place was deserted from Zealots by the time I came looking for you.\"\n\n\"Zealots? What about civilians?\"\n\nCecilia joins the interrogation with the question you least wish to answer at this moment, \"And where\u0027s David?\"\n\n\"The Father killed him.\" You answer succinctly, still trying to get your mind off of it-- you don\u0027t want anymore nightmares. \"I\u0027m going to deal with the civilians soon, Ragnor. I have a plan for them.\"\n\nRagnor nods in turn, \"Unfortunate, though he died a warrior\u0027s death. What shall you do with the civilians?\"\n\n\"Ghoul them, use them to help rebuild this city. Once this works, we can make an entire civilization of Zealots, and then... Find the Professor and kill the bastard.\"\n\n\"Solid thinking. But what precisely is the next move?\"\n\n\"Well, where are the surviving Creations?\"\n\n\"Rampaging. Cecilia here was the only one of the virgins to be able to control their forms.\"\n\n\"Rampaging?\"\n\n\"Err, yeah.\" Ragnor replies, confused, \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\n\n\"For the plan to work we need as many live humans as possible to rebuild. Ghouls, remember?\" Without wasting anymore time, you begin to move back in search of the Wolves when you feel a heavy hand on your shoulder, holding you back.\n\n\"Woah there, Vamp. Are you sure you want to stop them? This is the first time they\u0027re in actual control of their lives. Plus, they\u0027re probably too tired to do any real damage. Just let \u0027em have their fun, alright?\"\n",
  "page 268": "Slowly you tread toward the chubby man, licking your lips in anticipation. You are overcome with excitement, and find your hands tingling and sporadically jumping. Your claws seem to just hang loose and your fangs appear almost naturally, and you find yourself taking gleeful strides as you near the man. As Father Tomas watches, you cut the man with all five claws on your right hand.\n\nIt\u0027s easy and quick, the blood pouring out of the man\u0027s chest and onto your fingertips. As the man cries out in anguish, you lick and slobber at your hands, as though an animal. Perhaps you do feel a bit of sympathy and disgust at what you\u0027ve done, but it feels so good. You comp down on the man\u0027s neck, drinking all of the man\u0027s life-blood and enjoying every moment of it.\n\nBefore you know it, it is over. A dead man lays in your arms, his eyes and mouth still open in fright. It is then when you feel sadness at your lack of self-control, but a hand clutches at your shoulder.\n\n\"Very good, Vampire. See, this is your nature; no matter how hard you try to mask it, this is what you are, and this is what you must eradicate to atone for your wrongdoings.\"\n\nThe next week you are briefed by Father Tomas that the raid will be on the Wolves-- a group of experiments able to shift into a horrible were-form when enraged. Learning how to use all of the Zealot gadgets, you are equipped with the sleek armor, tusked rifle and visor and sent to lead a group of Zealots to deep desert to search out the underground base. Supposedly the reason for the \u0027Raid on the Wolf-Underground\u0027 was due to a recent attack on patrolling officers, though you aren\u0027t told much more detail on that. The week was rough regardless, as Tomas forced you to go to town on all the humanity left in your very being-- though maybe you came out stronger from it. Who knows?\n\nAs the night appears and the moon lights the way for your division of faceless Zealots, ready for cleansing the world of carnivorous shape-shifters, you begin your march. Zadok at your right, determined as ever, and a white-armored Zealot who goes by \u0027Karat\u0027. Karat is loud and overall obnoxious, but you\u0027re able to ignore him while the serious conversations appear between you and Zadok.\n\n\"Father Tomas said that one we reach the entrance you should go first.\" Zadok states, several miles into the trek. You note that the heavy metal boots are annoying to use in conditions with so much sand about, though you imagine it must be necessary when against against Creations.\n\n\"Yeah, I bet he did. Don\u0027t worry about it Zadok, I can handle myself.\"\n\nHe nods, leaving the rest of the trek silent besides Karat\u0027s outlandish claims of beheading a wolf with but a powerful punch. (Zadok told you to just ignore him, and so you do.)\n\nFinally you come to where the intel described the location of the underground-base to be, and several people begin to dig. About half an hour through, you hear a clanging and see that they found a metal lid covering a well.\n\nChoosing to be discreet, you have you and Zadok slowly chip away at the well, just enough the your rifles can just lift the sealed disk off the well.\n\nFortunately, it works. Using hand-signals Tomas taught you, you direct them to come within ten minutes if they don\u0027t hear anything from you. You slowly drop down the well, using the embedded ledges as steps.\n\nOnce in the well, you slowly trod, noticing torches lit pretty far down. You begin your excavation, following the walls and the odd-drawings along them. An odd language seems to accompany the drawings, one that you can\u0027t quite decipher. You shrug, continuing down the wet path until you notice noise from above. Looking up, you see some light through a round entrance (with no ladder of any sort) and hear odd cackles coming through. You take a deep breath-- this is it.\n\nInstinctively, you unlatch a smoke-grenade from your belt and throw it through the hole. As you hear the fizzle you immediately leap up and through the entrance. What you see is fairly bizarre-- a group of human, though hairy adolescents and adults, huddled up around a weak lamp. They cough incessantly, only one or two able to see through the smoke like you can and stare at you.\n\nAs a rather lovely looking blonde wolf opens her mouth to scream, it suddenly dawns at you that perhaps these \u0027abominations\u0027 are relatively normal, though frightened people that aren\u0027t inherently malevolent at all. The hairy group stare at you wth wide-eyes, completely confused by the situation. A burly hunch-backed one and a hooded man slowly begin to rise as the more youthful wolves just stare glossy eyed at the scene.\n",
  "page 7": "Out of nowhere, a humanoid with flashy armor leaps at you. Fearful, you quickly send out a powerful jab, lamely clunking on his armor as he topples on top of you. You expect him to attack, or continue the assault, but he appears to be as dazed you are. Although the metal armor is heavy, you\u0027re able to throw him off of yourself, hearing a splintering in the wooden floor as he lands.\n\n\"I\u0027m here.\"\n\nIt\u0027s Kelso. His striking features resemble an older gentleman. Whitish blonde hair and a gruff voice, though perhaps with a slight German accent-- almost grandfather-like. \"Master, where were you? What... is this man doing here?\"\n\n\"C.E. Agent, member of the Church and Special-Forces Unit for taking care of our kind. You need to kill this filth.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, \"What? I dunno... Ugh. No, Kelso. He\u0027s just, like, doing his job. I think? No, it doesn\u0027t matter! What\u0027s going on?\"\n\n\"His job is to murder Creations, government is after us and the rest of the-- the Professor\u0027s creations. We\u0027re not safe. Which, is why you need to kill this officer. You need to get used to this before it becomes more common to handle.\"\n\nThe soldier slowly looks up at you, scrambling to get up. \"You two... speak? Lord in heaven, the damned speak!\"\n\nYou can imagine his eyes would be widening right about now, but his entire body is covered in the metal suit, flashing with electric blue lining, his helmet with a black visor. The figure, now up, begins to scramble for a rifle-like object, but Kelso gives a heavy slap to the back of his head, sending the man flying forward, his helmet flying off in a different direction.\n\n\"Kelso, Creations? What the hell is going on? Tell me!\"\n\n\"First, kill him.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m really not sure about this...\"\n\n\"Kid, I know you\u0027re hungry.\" It\u0027s true. \"This is the only thing you can feast on.\"\n\nYou just stare in disbelief, shaking your head. Kelso stares at you for a moment before turning around and kicking the operative in the side. You hear a dent and a crack, likely his ribs were smashed along with his armor.\n\n\"Let\u0027s get your questions over with. Now. You need to decide what you\u0027ll do with him.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, just shocked at everything that\u0027s transpiring. After mumbling and scratching your head, you think you know what to ask.\n",
  "page 146": "With the alarms already blaring you make sure not to waste time in getting out of the building and into the Church. Outside, swarms of Zealots are coming out of the Church\u0027s front doors, obviously en route to fight Ragnor and his Wolves. You and David mostly blend in enough to not be recognized as anything but Zealots and manage to swim past the incoming horde and through the next street, then up the concrete steps of the Church and right in front of the Chapel\u0027s gates..\n\n\"How should we enter, then?\"\n\n\"No backdoors to the Church. Only one direction if you follow God.\" David recites from behind you.\n\nYou consider trying to bash the door in, but decide that knocking it and waiting for the door to be opened by whoever\u0027s inside would be an easier solution for getting in.\n\nClang\n\nYour gauntlet taps at the metal. After a pause, you can hear noises on the inside of the Chapel, mostly worried murmuring. You quickly motion for David to go in front, right before a bald young man in ceremonial blue robe opens the door. In response to your ghoul\u0027s profile, the man just gapes for several moments before opening his mouth to speak. \"Dave?!?\"\n\n\"No... Not anymore.\" He states, walking into the Church. The man doesn\u0027t seem to even notice you, engrossed in seeing a living ghost instead. Inside, several other monks are gathered, all of them staring at David with awe. You take the opportunity to slink into the shadow, and wait.\n\n\"Behold! The blessed Lord brought our child back!\" They cry, waving their hands in the air in synchronization. Up and down their hands go, until one with a cowl speaks up, \"Brother David, where were you?\"\n\nYour ghoul stares at them with disdain, \"I got lost, but was found by a group of humans.\"\n\nThey continue to gape. The cowled-one continues his interrogation, \"Hmm? More humans, you say?\n\n\"Crazy enough, the humans were in our backyard this entire time. We just didn\u0027t recognize them.\"\n\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"The Wolves, Vadim. They\u0027re good people.\"\n\nGasps erupt, and David\u0027s only looks down to his feet, and his hands ball up to fists. \"They changed you, didn\u0027t they?\" The one with the cowl points, and begins to chant in some sort of language which you are unfamiliar with.\n\nBored of their religious, antics, you make your presence known by jumping out of the shadows, and decking \u0027Vadim\u0027 with a right hook, sending him to the middle of the crowd of twelve-or-so Monks. David nods, and sends a sharp kick to the nearest Zealot surrounding him. Before you know it, it becomes a rowdy brawl of fists.\n\nThe monks may be very agile, but without any weapons nor armor you figure you or even David could take them out alone.\n",
  "page 149": "\"David, finish off these grunts as I find the big man upstairs.\" You call out, examining the building for the Father\u0027s Quarters.\n\nDavid nods, \"Up the stairs, to the left!\"\n\nYour head turns from right to left, looking for the set of stairs that will lead you to the Father. Finding the red-carpeted stairs, you begin your ascent, only to be stopped by a heavy-set Monk, who angrily shoves you backwards. \"Get away, foul demon!\"\n\nHe continues pushing, but you catch his left arm, and end squeeze-- Crack. He yells out in pain, and you manage to grab him by the cuff of his robe, only to throw him out of the way and into a wall. You run up the staircase, skipping steps to maintain speed. After reaching the end of the first staircase, you deftly,turn your body, not wasting any time by getting to the adjacent continuation of the stairs. Several leaps later, you reach the end of the stair case, only to be confronted by a terribly old man in a ceremonial blue robe, with a skullcap covering his no doubt balding head. His face is withered, and his frail eyes only compliment an extremely happy demeanor. This, you presume, is Father Tomas.\n\nHe stares at you, silent, and raises a large metallic cross from an opening of his robe, though he seems to be holding it the wrong way...\n\nWary of his silver weapon, you take a step to the side-- giving you room. \"Father Tomas, it seems that I have finally had the honor to meet you.\"\n\n\"No, the pleasure is mine, Vampire. Fate has brought it that it is my responsibility to put you down, as well as your canine friends.\"\n\nYou glare at him in anger, and flick at your wrist; claws out, you get into a battle-stance. He, in turn, raises his shimmering Cross, wielding it as a sword.\n\n\"I wouldn\u0027t put up a fight, if I were you. I know for a fact that you Creations can\u0027t heal from a wound of silver, and as such you have no otherworldly advantage over me.\"\n\nYou laugh, \"Except perhaps the age part.\"\n\nThe priest stops smiling and instead eyes you angrily, \"I suppose you\u0027ll learn the hard way. Now, let\u0027s make that broken nose something much more.. painful.\" Offended, you touch at your nose, is it really that noticeable?\n\nRegardless, he slowly begins to approach you, his sword, pulsating with some sort of unrecognizable energy, held high.\n\nYou make a quick examination of your surroundings: the stair case from behind you, doors and other hallways to your right, though several meters forward and to your left is a ledge, where there\u0027s an at least three-story drop down to the first floor, where you can see David slowly whittling off the Monks. Perhaps you can use the ledge to your advantage...\n\nYou continue to parallel the insane priest, your claws at your side and your wits still intact. You need to make the first move, but how should you go about it? The man looks old, but something about him tells you that he\u0027s more than capable of wielding his weapon masterfully. Still, you\u0027re probably quicker than him, and a quick fight is all you need. Then again, you need to watch out for the silver sword, because if he gets a solid hit on you then you\u0027re done.\n",
  "page 148": "Man, these bastards are quick.\n\nYou may have gotten lucky with the Vadim fellow, but the rest, now pumping with adrenaline, are much harder to hit. The bald men may not be especially strong, but they\u0027re skilled enough that they can at least dodge and block your powerful claws and punches. Of course, they\u0027re bound to get tired after a minute or so of constant movement, but I need to get this done quickly.\n\n\"Oof.\" One grunts as you land a knee into his groin, he stumbles to your side, where a heavy-set Monk elbows at your ribs-- only to miss and be targeted by David, who was unsuccessfully trying to down a midget of a Zealot. Your ghoul manages to leap atop of him and .wrap his arms around the man\u0027s neck.\n\n\"What... happened.... to you... my.... friend...\" Are his last words.\n\nThe remaining monks still take up your time, giving quick jabs to your non-existent pressure points as you try to land a hit on them. The acrobats continue dodging, and you relentlessly continue, not hampered by mortal energy-consumption. They begin to slow, and your wild, badly-timed swings catch several of the surrounding monks, crushing their bones easily. Minutes passed, the only one standing is the sweating midget named, \u0027Miguel\u0027, who hopelessly kneels before you, \"O how the lord has bested us, taught us a lesson in humility in dream-form, he did. Wake us from this nightmare, O merciful God!\"\n\nYou punt him across the room, cackling as you do so.\n\nUnfortunately for yourself and David, you can hear sirens-- Ragnor has begun his siege. You look from around you, and in front of you appears a pruned old man, wearing a ceremonial blue robe and a skullcap, wielding a shining... silver cross? Only, upside-down... As a sword... Father Tomas stares at you with a surprisingly serene smile, considering what you did with his disciples. \"My monks did their part, do not worry, Vampire.\"\n\nMoments later, the old man throws his heavy rod with unreal accuracy and force, impaling your belly and opening it, spilling some gastric juices, but that\u0027s all. You feel your body convulsing as the holy metals sucks at your life force. You groan in pain, and kneel before the lord...\n\nIf only you finished this man earlier.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",

  "page 3": "A sigh leaves your lips as you ruffle your hair with your hand. Now scratching, several hairs fall off. Perhaps not too unusal; trivial, even. But things like this interest people in boredom. That, and the twitching of a certain fly beside the table. Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.\n\nIt\u0027s annoying. Your nose flares as you continue to sit. Sleep isn\u0027t what it used to be either, more like an odd sort of meditating. Besides that, your senses continue to ring as the fly takes to the air around you. It lands, and you feel a faint tickle on your cheek-- And you catch the damned bugger. Nothing but your hand moved, a small action was all it took to take the flies life. You didn\u0027t even mean to kill it immediately, though you don\u0027t mind it\u0027s yellow ooze. Without feeling it, you squished it.

  "page 99": "As you warily near the steel entrance to the Zealot headquarters, David taps on your shoulder, silently beckoning you to follow him. You comply, and follow your ghoul to around the building, where, after going up several flights of metal stairs (making as little noise as possible), you find a molding wooden door, a nice change from the ugly metal and concrete which make up the rest of the City. Of course, aside from giving you a vague feeling of deja vu, it\u0027s also gives you an easy opening. David motions toward it. Now let\u0027s make some noise.\n\nYou remain careful in your last moments of anonymity, you try the golden knob- locked. Not wanting to jam it accidentally, you settle for setting up a roundhouse kick-- you twist your body, hold for a forceful kick, and push.\n\nThe power of your kick rips at the wood, leaving a splintered hole in the door\u0027s midsection, big enough for you to swiftly roll under-- David following. Inside, you find several Zealots playing cards around a round table. They are visibly stunned, and gape at you and your ghoul.\n\n\"David?\" One asks, jumping up from their seat. Not cutting them any lack, you run at the Zealot, decking him to the floor with a solid punch. David takes on another, kicking him from the side, toppling him and his metal chair over. With only two left, you quickly claw at the one holding his hands up, splashing the table with his blood. With your claws entrenched in the Zealot neck, you fling him at the other the one. He flies, and with another clang the other one catches him, only to topple over as well. You quickly finish off any of them even barely conscious, clawing at their throats for edible parts. After grazing, you begin to hear footsteps. Can\u0027t waste time.\n\n\"Where\u0027s the chief?\" You roar, energized from the scuffle. David eyes bounce from each of the three doors connecting to other parts of the building, struggling to remember.\n\n\"I\u0027m the \u0027Chief\u0027, demonspawn.\" The door to the right opens, and there stands a tall, unusually garbed Zealot. Like most, he\u0027s tall, easily more than six feet and with navy blue armor with yellow lining, rather than the customary black and blue. He wears no mask, though his neck seems to be heavily guarded. Smart, but useless in my current state. \"Vampire, we knew you\u0027d come, but we didn\u0027t expect you to corrupt one of our own,\" he glares at David, and readies a gleaming silver sword, \"Nor for you to attack us when we least expect it. But no matter, you both will die where you stand, for you deserve no mercy in this world.\"\n\nYour ghoul points at him, \"Yes, that\u0027s Katar, we need to be careful with him though...\" You nod, wondering how the best way to approach the enemy would be.\n",
  "page 98": "Not wasting any time, you turn to face the Chapel. Metallic and looming over you, with a large neon cross, still flashing. The door is a harsh steel, too old to cast a discernable reflection but maintained enough not to rust nor weaken. \"How should we enter, then?\"\n\n\"No backdoors to the Church. Only one direction if you follow God.\" David recites from behind you.\n\nWith a shrug, you continue onwards, going up a flight of concrete stairs, leading up to the looming steel door. You consider trying to bash the door in, but decide that knocking it and waiting for the door to be opened by whoever\u0027s inside would be an easier solution for getting in.\n\nClang\n\nYour gauntlet taps at the metal. After a pause, you can hear noises on the inside of the Chapel, mostly worried murmuring. You quickly motion for David to go in front, right before a bald young man in ceremonial blue robe opens the door. In response to your ghoul\u0027s profile, the man just gapes for several moments before opening his mouth to speak. \"Dave?!?\"\n\n\"No... Not anymore.\" He states, walking into the Church. The man doesn\u0027t seem to even notice you, engrossed in seeing a living ghost instead. Inside, several other monks are gathered, all of them staring at David with awe. You take the opportunity to slink into the shadow, and wait.\n\n\"Behold! The blessed Lord brought our child back!\" They cry, waving their hands in the air in synchronization. Up and down their hands go, until one with a cowl speaks up, \"Brother David, where were you?\"\n\nYour ghoul stares at them with disdain, \"I got lost, but was found by a group of humans.\"\n\nThey continue to gape. The cowled-one continues his interrogation, \"Hmm? More humans, you say?\n\n\"Crazy enough, the humans were in our backyard this entire time. We just didn\u0027t recognize them.\"\n\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"The Wolves, Vadim. They\u0027re good people.\"\n\nGasps erupt, and David\u0027s only looks down to his feet, and his hands ball up to fists. \"They changed you, didn\u0027t they?\" The one with the cowl points, and begins to chant in some sort of language which you are unfamiliar with.\n\nBored of their religious, antics, you make your presence known by jumping out of the shadows, and decking \u0027Vadim\u0027 with a right hook, sending him to the middle of the crowd of twelve-or-so Monks. David nods, and sends a sharp kick to the nearest Zealot surrounding him. Before you know it, it becomes a rowdy brawl of fists.\n\nThe monks may be very agile, but without any weapons nor armor you figure you or even David could take them out alone. Something tells you the alarms around the buildings weren\u0027t for show either-- you need to find the Father, quick!\n",
  "page 9": "\"You and me both. The Professor was a nasty sort, creating freaks of nature to...\" His face seems to strain, though for reasons you may or may not realize, \"To... for a program, you see. The Government shut the facility down early enough, but he kept the creations up and running for a while longer. When the soldiers came to burn the place down, well, that\u0027s where you and I come in. Possibly others.\"\n\n\"There are more like me and you?\" You ask, trying to absorb as much as you can before Kelso shuts up again.\n\n\"Maybe. I\u0027d be surprised if that much survived the raid. But there are certainly other experiments that the Professor did. Chimera, Were-beasts, you name it. And, of course, \u0027vampires\u0027, like you.\"\n\n\"What about yourself? I thought you were a vampire as well?\n\n\"I\u0027m a lot of things.\"\n\nA pause in the conversation occurs, before you shake your head and continue the questionnaire, \"Right... And why are the soldiers trying to kill us?\"\n\n\"I told you already, the Church, lead by a certain priest named \u0027Tomas\u0027, believes we\u0027re demonic mutants created by the Professor. They think they\u0027re cleaning the world from us. That\u0027s what they\u0027ve been doing for years, hunting down Creations on some sort of religious-killing spree. The facility which you woke up from was the last one before they destroyed it. Even though we live virtually forever, this is a curse, kid, and they realize that. As Creations, we\u0027re biologically forced to do things. We have to drink blood-- it\u0027s a necessity. The sunlight burns us, for our skin is too fair. What they don\u0027t realize is that we\u0027re also sentient beings. We were humans, once.\n\n\u0027\u0027And yet, the bastard that made us still lives somewhere out there. And I want you to help me find him. Furthermore, if we make a good enough team, we may even be able to overthrow the Church, for it\u0027s reach is strong. They\u0027re more or less the only ruling bodies the world has currently... Both of them, the Professor and the Church, are evils that need to be eradicated. We\u0027ll stop them both, just stick with me, kid.\"\n",
  "page 91": "\"Hey Vamp, take a seat.\" Ragnor calls out, waving you over to the off-kilter wooden bench he\u0027s sitting on. You comply; after several days and nights with barely any breaks, even sitting down to converse with the balding man who broke your Ghoul\u0027s neck sounds appealing. Plus, he can\u0027t exactly complain about not getting work done if he\u0027s taking a breather as well. If there\u0027s one thing you know about Ragnor, it\u0027s that he hates the Church more than anything. Except maybe the Professor; you\u0027ve never really talked with him that much, after all. The cloaked man smiles at you, and helps sit you down with a heavy hand clutching onto your shoulder. \"Hey man, I\u0027m really glad you joined us,\" he begins, taking his arm off of you and bringing it in front for a handshake; you respond in kind.\n\n\"Not as glad as I am to have joined.\" You laugh, releasing.\n\n\"Don\u0027t be so sure. It was getting rather stale, just hiding out in a bunker until we run out of food. You\u0027ve given us something to strive for.\"\n\n\"Fighting the Church?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He nods, pauses, then shows out his palms to you in a waving motion, \"I know, I know. Gideon\u0027s not exactly fond of it, but if it comes down to us and them, I vote us.\" Ragnor laughs. \"You know, the moment you said that the Church is planning to destroy us, I already was planning on trying to overthrow the city.\"\n\n\"You seemed very confident about it.\" You nod, rubbing at your chin, \"But why?\"\n\n\"So that we have a stronghold strong enough that we won\u0027t be able to be exterminated that easily. We\u0027re a small group, the Creations. And it\u0027s not exactly a growing population either, at best you can ghoul whatever, but we can\u0027t breed normally. It takes more time for it to work, you know...\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, amused, \"You\u0027ve tried?\"\n\n\"Ha, back when I was practically mind-controlled by the Professor, yeah. Heck, he probably tried things with you while you were unconscious, but who knows? Life before civilization fell was much different than now. The bastard wanted to create a new specie of man, and instead he got Hollywood monsters with bad skin conditions.\" He shrugs, \"But in some ways he succeeded, and I think that the Church shouldn\u0027t be allowed to hunt us down for it\u0027s own sake. There are some good kids in our pack, you know. Just honest-to-god decent kids that the Church wants to put down. It\u0027s not right.\"\n\n\"So what will you be doing if you suceed?\"\n\n\"Hunt down the Professor, definitely. The Church may be corrupt, but the root of the evil afflicted to the world spawned from that one man. After we end the Church in the nearby city, then we\u0027ll be able to be in charge.\"\n\n\"You seem confident that a couple of Creations can take on hundreds of Zealots.\"\n\nRagnor looks at you with a wry grin, \"You seem to be under a false-impression-- there really aren\u0027t that many Zealots. Can\u0027t be. The city they have is large, but only in comparison to other strongholds. Zealots are almost always male, if only because armor-fitting females is different, and they\u0027re probably sparse on metal. Plus, only able-bodied men can wield those huge-ass rifles. I\u0027d say they have 200 Zealots tops, and that\u0027s not including how many you\u0027ve just killed. Furthermore, they\u0027ll be divided while they march to our hideout and...\"\n\n\"That\u0027s still a lot.\"\n\nHe shrugs, \"As Wolves, we can shift either at will or automatically when stimulated luminescent orbs for some reason, into huge were-beasts. With proficiency, we can prove to be the fastest and most lethal things left on the planet. If, this week, we can train the kids to use their powers well, then it\u0027s definitely doable.\"\n\n\"You sure Gideon\u0027s okay with it?\" You ask, wondering whether you\u0027ll be joining him for sure,\n\n\"Regardless of what Gideon thinks about it, I won\u0027t be taking everybody with me, that\u0027s too much of a risk, and I doubt I could convince everybody, but...\"\n\nYou shrug, changing the subject, \"How experienced are you at your abilities?\"\n\n\"Enough.\"\n\n\"You think you can take me on?\" You ask, leaning forward and balancing your body on your palms.\n\n\"Maybe. I kind of figure the Vampire Creations were made in order to build foundations for the Professor. They can live forever, create progeny of sorts, etc. I have no idea how combat ready they are. Still, you\u0027re extremely resourceful, so I definitely hope you stick around. With your ghouling powers, we can create an entire civilization of Creations. Imagine how great that\u0027d be!\"\n\n\"I\u0027ll be honest, Ragnor; you didn\u0027t seem so cheery when I first met you.\"\n\n\"When you first met me I had to make a good impression.\" He laughs. \"Now, come on, we need to get back to training the cubs.\"\n",
  "page 90": "The week passes by too soon for for your liking, but you and your compatriots can all agree that you got work done. You spent the week teaching the lesser-experienced Creations how to use their powers in battle, emphasizing team-work and effort. Like Kelso taught you, you passed on the knowledge of the power of emotion-- something you can vouch works in a fight. As the training went on it became rather obvious that in their human form, you can easily take on the strongest werewolf. In the real, bestial for, however, you have to use your wits. For that, you are forever thankful you are on the Wolves\u0027 good side. Heck, you\u0027re leading them to possible suicide.\n\nOther things you\u0027ve focused on is appealing to both Gideon and Ragnor, both people whom you know you can trust to some sort of degree.\n\nThe one thing you feel somewhat apologetic about is that you haven\u0027t been able to spend as much time with Cecilia as you wanted to, but you manage to remind yourself that if you succeed in taking over the City, you\u0027ll have all the time in the world. Perhaps, with enough time, you\u0027ll even learn the wolven-lingo, though it\u0027s the least of your worries currently.\n\nYou focus on the plan: it\u0027s basic espionage, like how a movie would set it out (though you can\u0027t remember any one in particular). They send a one-man army to the middle of the battlefield, while they storm the castle-walls. You\u0027re confident that you can take care of yourself, especially in the night-time, assuming that\u0027s when you\u0027re sent in.\n\nThe Creations stand together in a circle, well below the surface, waiting for the the scouting team (Ragnor\u0027s group) to tell you whether today is the day. While the Zealots begin their march to the Stronghold, the Creations will quickly get away, and run toward the city, attacking it while half of it\u0027s forces are trying to find the nonexistent. Time passes; you do this twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to see if they\u0027re preparing for a night-attack or not. You hope it\u0027s at night, as the Creations would have an advantage, probably. Additionally, you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about sun-tan lotion, the tube Kelso gave you will run out sooner or later. And so you wait, everybody around you waiting in silence.\n\nYou hear the codified knock: Clunk-clunk-clunk.\n\nThat\u0027s three times. Today isn\u0027t the day after all.\n\nYou go out to train once more, reviewing everything, and then turning back to refill on blood. Gideon gives you a broken plastic-cup with maybe an ounce of his blood. You drink it slowly, savoring the taste. It reinvigorates you, like usual, and you set down to meditate, waiting for nightfall.\n\nThat night...\n\nClunk-clunk-clunk-clunk\n\nThat\u0027s 4... Is tonight the night?\n\nRagnor\u0027s hooded head pokes out of the hatch, \"Come on, wake everybody. Now!\"\n\nGetting out of your trance, you begin repeatedly whispering, \"Now!\" as you went along, pulling off blankets from the Wolves. As with procedure, the Wolves spring into action, readying their clothes and going down, dividing themselves into the groups. Soon, the only Creations left are you (after ushering everybody out) and Gideon. \"Gideon, are you coming?\" You ask, concerned. You don\u0027t want to be late, after all.\n\nThe hunchback stares back at you solemnly, not speaking.\n\n\"Goddammit Gideon, let\u0027s go!\" You begin edging out of the room.\n\nHe opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again.\n\n\"Gideon, if you don\u0027t come with us, you\u0027ll die. We want you with us, so just... Come, man.\"\n\n\"You may have been right about the Church, Vamp. But it doesn\u0027t change a thing. The real monster is the Professor, not humanity. Hurting them is hurting us...\"\n\nYou shake your head in disbelief, before angrily waving him off. That hippie won\u0027t bring me down.\n\nWith haste, you make it to the well\u0027s opening, jumping off the walls to speedily catch up with Ragnor and the others. You were lucky they chose night-time, but that doesn\u0027t mean they didn\u0027t take advantage of it either. No flashes from miles ahead, just darkness, and maybe some slow movement here or there... But you only notice it if you squint. Crafty of them. \"Ragnor, you see them?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He says, calling out from ahead, \"But where\u0027s Gideon? He\u0027s supposed to be leading his group!\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that fool is coming.\" You spit out, finally catching up. \"But it\u0027s unimportant. David can lead them.\"\n\n\"David isn\u0027t exactly a leading-personality.\"\n\n\"He knows what he\u0027s doing.\"\n\n\"Which is why he should come with you! He\u0027d be much more useful by you than by us. We\u0027re just giving you time. We can have one of the other Wolves lead, but for now you will no doubt need help, and a former Zealot is just perfect.\"\n",
  "page 93": "\"Cecilia, please stop it.\" You say, pushing her off you. Thinking it through, it probably wasn\u0027t the best idea for you to personally trainer of the woman with mutual, though perhaps repressed for the moment, feelings for you. Regardless, she seems a bit too happy when she get close-and-personal with you during a sparring match. With a sigh, you look over to Ragnor and Gideon\u0027s respective groups-- it was a smart way the three of you ended up dividing the workload. Each of you would take 4 of the Wolves and personally trained them to defend themselves. Perhaps they gave you too much credit-- you\u0027re not a hundred percent sure what to do. Kelso was the one who taught you, but he seemed to recognize that berserking was the way you could unleash your full strength. You\u0027ll have to figure out how the Wolves were designed to fight, soon. On the plus side, you\u0027re very happy with you \u0027students\u0027, to the point that the names stick out in your mind. Shamino is a heavy-hitter, though surprisingly clumsy for one of his set stature; Haran is extremely agile, and almost vampire-like when it comes to fighting; and Cecilia, is, well, Cecilia.\n\n\"So, group, have any of you ever shifted into your were-forms?\" You ask, gathering your group outside the dunes. In the dark of night, the flat land of sand that you found might seem unimpressive, but the fact that\u0027s it\u0027s mostly flat is more rare than one would think here; the landscape is usually riddled with smaller hills evrywhere.\n\n\"Not me.\" Haran says raising his hand, \"Ragnor said that we\u0027ll turn only if our bodies deem it necessary. Or when there\u0027s a ball of light, but the moon isn\u0027t round tonight.\"\n\nAs the rest of the Wolves nod, you rub your chin in thought. \"David!\" You call, waving to your ghoul, who is walking around, aimlessly for whatever reason. \"Can you bring one of the L-Bayonets?\" He nods in response, and wanders back the to Stronghold.\n\n\"What do you want with the.. the guns?\" The young Shamino asks, looking frightened. The other two Wolves seem to look disturbed as well,\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry haha. We need to train your fortitude as well as make sure you master your abilities. From what it seems, you haven\u0027t done either.\" You watch them idly, waiting for David to bring the gun. As much as it may pain you, you\u0027ll need to see what the electronic bolt will do to them. If all goes well, they\u0027ll be forced to morph. And only then can you get started...\n\n\"You want to force us to morph for you.\" Cecilia states, frowning.\n\n\"Not for me, for you.\" You emphasize with a nod, \"The way learned to fight was when I had to unleash my primal being, but still pay close attention to my abilities and skills. If you want to defend against the the Zealots, then we need to see you morph.\"\n\nThey all gulp, but nod confidently. When David returns  with the rifle, you firmly grasp it and prop it up, \"This,\" you shake it as as to bring it at attention, \"is the Zealots primary weapon. The tusks at the end are sharp, and will probably pierce nearly any type of hide. Still, assuming you have any sort of health-regeneration abilities, that shouldn\u0027t be a problem. What will be a problem, however, is what this rifle shoots out. Lightning.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nYou clap, \"So, who wants to see who can handle the \u0027holy\u0027 firepower?\" To your surprise, both Cecilia and Shamino raise heir hands fairly quickly. Even though you\u0027re pretty sure Cecilia raised her hand first, you aim the gun in then big Asian\u0027s direction, \"Shamino, you ready?\"\n\nHe nods, bracing himself as his team-mates slowly back away from him.\n\nYou unleash the shot, it\u0027s force even taking you off guard as it erupts out of the rifle\u0027s end. The green-blue bolt reaches poor Shamino almost instantaneously, flinging him several feet in the air and into the sand, causing a small sand-mound of his own. You and the rest run to catch up to him, hoping he\u0027s alright.\n\nWhat you see isn\u0027t necessarily \u0027alright\u0027, per se, but it\u0027s what you wanted to see. What was a powerful Asian teenager is now a hulking, barely conscious furry monster. As it gets up, the snarling beast (about twice your height and thrice your width) begins sniffing around, it\u0027s eyes fully white. It\u0027s nose beckons in your direction before it lets out a horrible cry-- a howl. As your two students begin to run and David passively watches from afar, you find yourself at the mercy of Shamino the Werewolf. It starts towards you, walking on two feet and using it\u0027s other limbs to claw in your direction. While the beast begins it\u0027s charge, you take the initiative by jumping at it yourself,using the rifle\u0027s tusks as a range advantage. You stick the horns into the werewolf, though you\u0027re not surprised that it doesn\u0027t do much to slow it down. By now it has it\u0027s oversized arms around  you, crushing your body...\n\nClick\n\nA bolt of lightning shoots out, straight into the werewolf\u0027s stomach. More sticky blood oozes from its stomach, and ith a growl the beast releases you, if only to take the gun out from between its ribs. Once again taking the initiative, you send a slamming claw to it\u0027s snout, and follow up with a kick to its already bleeding midsection. While it pushes it back, it doesn\u0027t seem to do as much as you\u0027d hoped. It takes the bayonet and uses it like a bat to hit you, leaving you breathless as you are flung into the sky, the heavy gun landing on-top of you. You cough out blood, and get up to analyze the situation: Ragnor and Gideon\u0027s groups have stopped training just to watch while David, Haran and Cecilia finally get into action. You run to catch up with them, and the unfolding scene would make you tear if you could; the three of them coordinate with each-other beautifully, with Haran both dodging the werewolf\u0027s blows and throwing sand at its eyes in order to occupy it, while the other tackle at it\u0027s heavy feet, just managing to trip it, and keep it there. It\u0027s not the greatest way to end a fight, but it\u0027s good teamwork.\n\nBy the time you reach them, Shamino is in his regular form, bleeding only slightly from his nose. He seems oblivious as to what happened, but you\u0027re excited team-mates are more than happy to fill him in. Several more lessons like this, and they\u0027ll be more than ready to fight the Zealots. After all, taking down a werewolf is much easier than a human.\n",
  "page 92": "Hours pass quicker than you\u0027d want during the training sessions. You\u0027ve realized that the Wolves are powerful, but undisciplined, almost childish at times. But at the end of the night, you got work done. Yet, even after the night passes, Gideon routinely goes under the hatch. You\u0027ve tried to peek at him, in interest of what he does when alone, but it brings no more results than asking around; zilch. But on one of those times you spend upside down, silently hanging from the hatch, Gideon turns around to acknowledge you.\n\nThe hunchbacked leader stares back at you with cold eyes, \"What do you want, lad? You think it\u0027s possible I really do just like sitting down here, alone?\"\n\nShocked, you suddenly lose your grip; only to land upright, as a cat would. \"I, uh, maybe. But I\u0027ve asked around, and people wonder about you, as I do. You\u0027re very... Silent, for a leader.\"\n\nHe laughs, \"Leader? Hah, that\u0027s good, Vampire. I just do the heavy work, as always. Keeping watch is one of my duties.\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t put yourself down, Gideon. You seem to know what you\u0027re doing.\" You say, unsure how to respond to his glumness.\n\n\"Vamp, the camp here believes you-- and that\u0027s fine by me, I\u0027ll be honest and say I trust you too, but the fact that we\u0027ll be fighting the Church isn\u0027t a good thing, regardless of the rewards.\"\n\n\"Like our lives?\"\n\n\"You\u0027re young and timeless, so it\u0027s not something you can really sympathize with.\" Gideon snorts, \"No offense, Vamp.\"\n\n\"None taken, but what do you mean?\" You say, letting him continue.\n\n \"I don\u0027t think you really get what the Church is. I mean, I don\u0027t think anybody here does. Even Ragnor, he\u0027s blinded by rage and fury. He believes that the Church needs to be destroyed for the betterment of everyone, especially us. But...\"\n\n\"But what?\" By now you\u0027re getting a bit agitated at Gideon for being so ambiguous.\n\nHe turns his face away, \"But he\u0027s dead wrong about it. Almost all of us here remember the treatments the Professor gave us. To say the least, you\u0027re lucky to have forgotten most, if not all of them. That man just bred hatred, even more than the religious back in the day.\" A pause. \"He hurt us all, in so many ways. But worse yet, he made us hurt others. It started with killing evil, but then came to killing innocents, the only food-source left for us. And we followed him through fire and water, that man. Kurschner represented our hopes and dreams, true power for a true purpose. But he lied to us, and used us for himself, experimented with us, made sure our past lives weren\u0027t there so that there was nothing for us to go back to. Even I don\u0027t remember too much of what was before I became a Wolf. The dreams stop after you get comfortable in your form.\"\n\nThe older gentlemen continues, \"By the way, are you still dreaming?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" You begin to realize that you indeed have stopped dreaming since you joined, \"No, I rest much better now.\"\n\nHe frowns in return, \"Best not get too comfortable here, then. Those dreams are your only way to know what is really going on.\"\n\n\"Which also reminds me, did you have somebody help you get out of the Facility before it was burnt down?\"\n\n\"Err, yes.\" You nervously answer.\n\n\"Did he have a name?\"\n\n\"Kelso.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Ahem, uh, Kelso.\" You repeat, slower this time. \"He said he knew you. Also mentioned a fellow named Stein.\"\n\nGideon bites his lip, \"Never met a fellow named Kelso. Did he say anything else?\"\n\n\"He mentioned being tasked with watching the Lesser Creations, along with several other elites.\"\n\n\"That explains it, though I can\u0027t say I know who he is under his new pseudo-name. I wonder where he is now...\"\n\n\"I wish I knew, \" you say, longingly, \"he said he\u0027d come back at some point, he was searching for the Professor.\"\n\n\"As do we all.\" Gideon says, closing his eyes, \"Simon Kurschner was one evil, however brilliant man. A lot of our older members ran out in hopes to hunt him down, though they never returned...\"\n",
  "page 95": "\"Alright,\" you reply with a nod, \"David will definitely be a huge help, considering that he\u0027s familiar with the area, but...\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\nYou frown, \"I hope you guys\u0027ll be safe. The Zealots, especially in number, aren\u0027t pushovers.\"\n\nRagnor smiles, and gives you a brotherly hug, \"Don\u0027t worry Vamp, we\u0027ll manage. The Wolves aren\u0027t exactly pushovers either haha.\"\n\n\"I know.\" You grin, returning the hug. You imagine, that after all this ends-- the fighting, you can retire, and just live your unlife with your new family. A dream, perhaps, but it\u0027s something to hope for. Soon after Ragnor turns to leave, he suddenly looks back at you, pupils dilated.\n\n\"Wait a sec, David was a Zealot before you ghouled him, right?\"\n\n\"Err, yeah.\"\n\n\"And he\u0027s still wearing his armor?\"\n\n\"Everything but the helmet.\"\n\n\"You think they\u0027d recognize him?\"\n\nA pause begins, and ends with laughter. Ragnor snaps at you and puts on a silly grin, and jogs ahead back to his groups. You don\u0027t know who will head the second group, but you hope that it won\u0027t matter. All you need to do is wreak havoc in the city, and stay alive. The assault groups will do the rest, hopefully without harm as well.\n\nWith David silently in tow, you continue on, analyzing the strong hold. Even from afar, the sleepless City is easily seen, and as you march on around the incoming Zealots, you can see how they set up the City\u0027s defense. Six sentries, commandeering strobe lights in a hexagonal circumference around the city, obviously looking out for unidentified enemies. Thankfully, flashing-Zealot armor is pretty identifiable, and so is David\u0027s face, assumably.\n\n\"David?\" You call, looking to make sure he\u0027s listening. He nods in return, but doesn\u0027t speak. \"You think the Zealots will recognize you if they see you?\"\n\n\"Definitely, why?\"\n\n\"Since that means that you can draw attention due to your disappearance while I kill the head-honchos.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s smart.\" He says, succinct as usual.\n\nYou quit trying to make conversation and, once you get close enough to the City, point at the Zealot commandeering the strobe light in front of you. \"Can you kill him before he turns to a radio?\"\n\nDavid nods, and clicks on his blinking Cross-armor (you figure that it\u0027s to ward off friendly-fire) before he begins the march through the strobe light, waving his hands in the air and running to the Sentry. After several moments, you can see a wordless discussion taking place, starting with the sentry saluting and ending with him unconscious on the floor. When David turns the light a bit to the right, it gives you dark-space to walk through, unnoticed.\n\nThe two groups are not too far away, and you manage to wave to Cecilia and Ragnor before following David into the urban Church City. You pat David\u0027s back and consider your good decision making. But, once again, you just hope the others will be alright...\n",
  "page 94": "\"Ragnor,\" you hold your hand out defiantly, \"I can do just fine alone. I trust in David enough to know that he will aid you a lot in holding the fort than helping me on a stealth mission. Now come on.\"\n\nRagnor grunts in protest, but shrugs it off. You and the the rest of the Wolves, keeping your heads low, move around the incoming horde of Zealots, attacking the City on its other side, almost opposite from where the Zealots marched from. After an hour of movement, you\u0027re eyes manage to detect the sentries watching the City. There are only perhaps 6 in total, evenly spaced out in hexagonal circumference around the City, but they each handle a fierce strobe-light that will bring light to the actual situation. Thankfully, the group is just far enough away that you aren\u0027t spotted.\n\n\"So, do we have any good ideas on how I\u0027m getting in?\" You ask, your mind flipping through several theoretical simulations of getting into the City: most of them, you die.\n\n\"You see the narrow dark passage-way in between the strobe lights?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You have to slip through that, then quickly kill the sentry on this side before he can get to the other, and then climb the barb-wire fence. You\u0027ll have to figure out what to do from then, but I\u0027d focus on finding the actual Chapel, and killing the Elders there. We\u0027ll be rushing the City on this entire side while you\u0027re inside, confusing the Zealots and buying you time. Got it? Why the long face?\"\n\nYou hand him your rifle, \"Guess I can\u0027t exactly bring this with me, haha.\"\n\nHe takes it, smiles, and then salutes; this may be the last time you see him or several members of the group. You don\u0027t bother saying goodbye, and leave it to the hands of fate. \"Just take care of Cecilia and David.\" You say, turning around to slowly creep forward...\n\nFirst taking it slow, you almost crawl on the ground as to not be seen by the sentry, and move forward. You position yourself perfectly so the lights miss you, and the cloudy sky allows you to remain concealed. As you crawl onward, you notice that the Zealot Sentry is practically sleeping; he must have been here all day, waiting. Seizing the opportunity, you make easy work of him by bite. The defenseless man is quickly drained, to the point of being unconscious for reasons other than tiredness. You don\u0027t even bother checking whether his pulse is still there, whether he\u0027s dead or not doesn\u0027t matter right now. Finding the big Chapel does. You keep the strobe-light on as to not raise attention to anything, and continue on inside of the City. You leap over the fence, still clad in the Zealot armor. What you see in the City is amazing.\n\nNothing, almost a ghost-town. While the City has flashing banners all over, only two large buildings seem occupied: one with a giant cross, the other with an upside-down cross, like a sword.\n\nAs you enter the former, obviously the Chapel, you see an elderly man open the door in front of you. His squinty eyes stare at you for a moment before he asks in a gravely voice, \"Has my time come already?\"\n\nWordlessly, you grab at his throat, and begin to unintentionally rip at it, blood trickling down your wrist. \"You are the reason for my brethren\u0027s suffering.\" you start, your pupils widening in anger, \"You and your Zealots made us have to resort to living in fucking burrows. This is where God\u0027s plans for you ends, Tomas.\"\n\n\"Then so be it.\"\n\nHe dies there and then, and you find several monks staring at you in horror from the Chapel\u0027s door. Noticing them, you enter the Chapel to kill them as well. The balding priests hold out their necklaces, yelling, \"We shall fear no evil for there is God.\" Over and over again.\n\nThankfully, you aren\u0027t evil; you\u0027re just looking out for your race. Protecting it from those who want to cut down on it. The blood of the zealots tastes better than ever, but it gets cut short by the sudden blaring of sirens-- the assault has begun.\n\nYet, oddly, enough, over ten Zealots rush in from all sides come to gawk at your bloody attire. While you cackle evilly when jumping and clawing at them, they still manage to have you surrounded by numbers if nothing else, breathlessly ending your unlife with their bayonets, all in the name of their God.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 97": "The strobe light aimed back to its original place and the Zealot downed by his own, you and David make your way to the barb-wire fence, and easily leap above it, too lazy to get the key from the Zealot. After David turns off his blinkers, you begin to pay more attention to the City only to realize that, from the inside at least, it isn\u0027t nearly as bustling as you thought it was. Perhaps that\u0027s because most of them went to raid the hideout. Gideon is still there...\n\nYou shake your head; you tried your best with that fool, now it\u0027s time to take what\u0027s yours; what the Creations deserve regardless of what the Church or the Professor think of them. Not weapons, not demons: just people. David waits for you to start walking again, tapping his foot eagerly. He doesn\u0027t speak much, but you can tell he enjoyed his time with the Wolves. Still, you\u0027ll always wonder what\u0027s inside his head, now as a ghoul.  You continue through the ghost-town, which for whatever reason has all of it\u0027s buildings rigged with neon lights, flashing. David leads you through the ugly urban landscape, and you keep a lookout for humans. Suddenly, you spot one, walking out of some sort of pub, walking unsteadily. You grab David by the cuff of his armor and quickly hide in the shadow of some sort of looming dumpster. With a finger to your lips, you wait until the man\u0027s back is turned before you sneak up on him, digging claws into his neck for a quick and silent death. The man falls to the ground dead, and you lick your bloody nails. David, unfazed, comes out of the shadows only to pick up the man, and silently position him into the trash. \"That pub holds a great deal of Zealots. We need to move out before they see me.\"\n\nYou nod in return. At first you considered just going in and slaughtering the gathering of Zealots, but then realized that the light-weights Ragnor and his crew could handle, but the higher-ups are going to be an issue. David once again takes lead, and you prowl the streets, silently killing anything in your way, passing by buildings of all shapes and sizes, though most not even occupied.\n\nTwo buildings in particular stand out, however: one mansion with a giant blue Cross above the door; the other large and rectangular with an upside-down Cross, for whatever reason.You\u0027d look through the windows to see what\u0027s going on inside, but the windows of both buildings seem to just reflect your own image, though you can only really discern your armor since your pale profile doesn\u0027t come out well in the reflection.\n\n\"The one with the holy-sword is Zealot-headquarters, the other one is the Chapel.\" David answers your thoughts, smiling at you. \"I think it\u0027s in our best interest to enter and clear out both.\"\n\n\"Which do you suggest to do first?\"\n\n\"Either one, sir. We need to kill Father Tomas and the Chief, both in their respective buildings. The Zealots who aren\u0027t on their way to the stronghold will be in both, though. But whichever we pick, we need to do it quick; Ragnor and the others will be making their move any moment now.\"\n",
  "page 150": "You continue to stand parallel to the Head-Zealot, slowly beckoning him closer to the side with a ledge. While you know you have to end the fight soon, you also know that this won\u0027t be an easy fight. The cackling priest advances, holding his heavy Cross out like a rapier, poking it at you, trying to get you to move back. Deciding that staying on the defensive won\u0027t save you from this mad man, you take action by leaping in his direction-- he grins, preparing to simply swing upwards to hit you, but manage to somersault out of the old man\u0027s swipe, and land a heavy kick to his face. He staggers backwards, his hand on his eye in a mixture of pain and anger. Tomas angrily sends another swipe with his sword at you, but you\u0027re already charging for him, pushing the old to the ledge that is now to your right with your forearm. The priest coughs, but quickly recovers.\n\nRelentless, you send another barrage of jabs at him, moving close enough to him that his long-range won\u0027t be an advantage for him. A mixture of punches and claws manage to cut his robe to shreds, and he struggles to get you off of him-- to no avail. After a silly, pointless scuffle you manage to hold him right by the ledge, where a fall to the death would await him. Tomas holds up his silver cross, creating a pseudo-barrier between the two of you, but you just grab hold of it with your gauntlets, and shove him at the wooden slabs, and slowly increase pressure, slowly increase it. Several seconds more of pushing, and he won\u0027t have a choice of how his body breaks, as you\u0027ll secure his death in the fall. You shove once more...\n\nSnap.\n\n\"There we go... See you in hell, bastard!\" The wooden splinters open, and you find the two of you tumbling down at several meters, both grasping for eachothers\u0027 throats.\n\nUnfortunately for you, the old man barely manages to grab hold of your hair and uses it as leverage to be just slightly above you...\n\nYou both fall with a heavy thud, your armored body crashing through the floor. You struggle to get out of it, as you find your armor almost embedded in to the rubble. Still, you manage to get up, and the sharp pang you feel in your head slowly begins to disappear.\n\nAs the dust clears, you find a bleeding Tomas with a bloody eye holding an unconscious David to the wall, his silver sword still gripped in his hands. His remaining useable eye stares right at you, and the priest begins to cackle further, \"If you take even one more step towards me, I swear I will slay your disciple right now. But, if you leave me here to die in peace, not of a sinners hand, then I can promise that I will not kill him. Hmm, you like this deal?\"\n\nYour loyal ghoul stares at you blankly, and his shaking head can either be interpreted as a plea to let him live or to kill the priest. Or perhaps something else?\n\nStunned and still recovering, you try to make a decision with a clear head...\n",
  "page 270": "I can beat this craving... I know I can...\n\n\"Give it up Father Tomas, I refuse to kill this man. Your ruse would work on an abomination... But I can and will change.\"\n\n\"Not on my watch you don\u0027t.\" The Father nears you, sending a quick palm at your chest-- it causes you to take several steps backwards in surprise, but little else.\n\n\"You can\u0027t seriously think you can beat me one on one, can you you insane geezer? I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re so blind that you can\u0027t accept my wish to change, to the point that you\u0027ll kill yourself for it!\"\n\n\"Actually, I do. In fact, I won\u0027t even bother turning the UV-lights on. I can handle you just fine, fiend. En gaurde!\" Father Tomas reaches into his robe and takes out a large silver rod, shaped like an upside-down cross.\n\n\"Is this another one of your cruel \u0027tests\u0027, Father?\" You ask, utterly confused. \"Because I don\u0027t want to kill you, I think. Can we just get on with the training?\"\n\n\"You missed out on your training. You\u0027re useless to me. Now is when you will die.\"\n\nSeeing your hesitation to fight, Tomas raises his heavy rod, and suddenly whacks the chubby man over the head with it! The man slumps over, blood gushing out of the side of his cranium.\n\nIt was all so sudden... \"You monster! How can you just kill a human being like that?\" You yell, now utterly disgusted by the priest. \"You call yourself the hand of God, equate yourself to Solomon... You\u0027re nothing but an egomaniac!\"\n\nAnger overriding your senses, you feel claws coming out of your finger tips and your jaw growing larger, stronger. Your vision soon fixates on the Father, holding a bloody rod and readying it to swing at you. You leap in his direction, ready to slash out his intestines and feast on those, but with surprising dexterity he parries your claws with his sword.\n\n\"Who is the real monster, eh? The one who dedicates his life to protecting his people, perhaps gets a bit \u0027extreme\u0027 in doing so, or the one who slaughters countless peoples in the name of \u0027science\u0027 only to claim to be reformed?\"\n\n\"What the hell are you on about?\"\n\n\"You know exactly what I\u0027m talking about, you fool. Acting like an amnesiac... Brilliant, but it doesn\u0027t fool me. Now die!\"\n\nHe forces through the clashing of claw and rod, pushing you backwards far enough that he is able to swing low at your knees. The metal thuds against your knees loudly, and you hear a sharp cracking as your legs seem powerless for a moment.\n\nTaking advantage of the momentary pause, the Father finishes you off with a heavy swing, the last though you have being slammed into the wall, your head smashing into the wall, and then darkness.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 152": "\"I honestly don\u0027t care how you die, Tomas. Just let David go.\"\n\nThe Priest laughs further. dropping David to the floor, \"I\u0027m glad you made the right choice. Now, go help your little friends while I die in peace.\"\n\nYour ghoul, almost in a fetus position, reaches out to you with a hand, mouthing words but not making any sounds. In fact, his body is shaking, but he isn\u0027t getting up. Tomas continues, \"So, what are you waiting for? Go, before the Zealots finish off your demonic friends!\"\n\nYour back straightens, and you silently examine the current situations. \"David, get up. I\u0027m not leaving without you.\"\n\nAs the ghoul inches towards you, the bloodied priest stomps his sandled foot on him. \"Did you not understand? Leave NOW, so I can trust you won\u0027t kill me. David will soon follow, I assure you.\"\n\nYou eye Tomas, \"Well, consider me not assured.\"\n\nThe Priest shrugs, \"You got me, Vampire.\" He withdraws his sword--\n\n\"NO!\" You run at him, trying to reach him before... Too late...\n\nYou find your ghoul\u0027s eyes blank and his body broken as the Priest continues to angrily beat him, laughing meanwhile. Still in motion, your body smashes into him, sending the old man flying into the wall and crumpling into a sack of flesh, blood and broken bones. Blinded by fury, you continue to pound the dead, shriveled corpse until it becomes a gooey mess.\n\nMinutes later, you get up to look back at your ghoul, you disciple, your friend; David: dead and not getting up. You take a deep breath, realizing that he\u0027s gone, and how he sacrificed his life for your unlife.\n\n\nWith a frown, you recognize that you\u0027re mission is accomplished, and so you solemnly go to investigate how the rest of the Creations are faring.\n",
  "page 151": "You plant your feet sturdily into the flooring, watching his sword with caution. Whenever he moves closer, you move forward and around him, bringing him closer to the ledge and maintaining an important amount of distance between the two of you. Tomas chuckles, and finally begins swinging his heavy artifact. He does so not wildly, rather with strong, fluid motions; all of which your utmost concentration allow you to just barely dodge. His long strokes give him a lot of range, and you have a feeling that he\u0027s only just started.\n\nHe picks up the pace, using his heavy sword more like a rapier, thrusting and swiping, attempting to corner you to the other side of the room; that isn\u0027t necessarily bad, as it\u0027s the side  that has the ledge, but you need to quickly get back in control of the fight if you wish to get the old fool.\n\nTomas advances, giving another quick thrust with his sword-- you try to take advantage of that by kicking his sword out of his hands, but his firm grip doesn\u0027t let go of it. Not wasting the opportunity, you leap at him while he rebalances the sword, and try to land a heavy claw at his neck. Seeing you, the old man, with bizarre agility,  drops to the floor, and sweeps your legs from under you, knocking your head on the rails. You quickly get back up with a sharp twist, but he has enough time to give you a thwack on the back with his sword. The pain stings, and you feel your bones crack as he smacks you upside the head again with it, over an over again. Every time you attempt you get up, you are taken out again by Tomas\u0027s repetitive strikes. Can\u0027t... Get back up...\n\nBefore you know it,\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 154": "You make your way outside of the building shaken but undeterred. The streets are empty, but you know that there are more humans in the houses, hiding. While the fighting itself may be dying down, you feel the need to go out and meet your courageous brethren, rather than have them come for you. You run down the steps and onto the concrete street, continuing back from where you came from, meanwhile trying to shove away distracting thoughts of your deceased friend. When this is done, we will honor you properly...\n\nEventually, you begin to notice armored corpses strewn about in awkward positions. Alternatively, you find a brown Wolf, whom you recognize as the Middle-eastern man, white-eyed and bloody by a curb. How many of us were lost this day?\n\nYou continue on in solemn silence when you reach the fence, and from beyond it you can see several more Wolven corpses. Frantically, you search for Cecilia-- Phew, none of them are blonde like she was. But still... This leaves perhaps eight of us left... Most likely the last of our kind.\n\n\"Vamp!\" Comes a cry behind you. You turn around quickly to be hugged by an especially warm Cecilia, with Ragnor smiling with glee. You return the embrace, happiness overcoming the previous thoughts of dread.\n\n\"I\u0027m glad to see your alright, man. We had a tough fight, but we fended the hordes of Zealots off. How did your fights go?\"\n\nYou nod, \"We... We killed Tomas and- and a man named Karat, called himself \u0027Chief\u0027.  Either way, the place was deserted from Zealots by the time I came looking for you.\"\n\n\"Zealots? What about civilians?\"\n\nCecilia joins the interrogation with the question you least wish to answer at this moment, \"And where\u0027s David?\"\n\n\"The Father killed him.\" You answer succinctly, still trying to get your mind off of it-- you don\u0027t want anymore nightmares. \"I\u0027m going to deal with the civilians soon, Ragnor. I have a plan for them.\"\n\nRagnor nods in turn, \"Unfortunate, though he died a warrior\u0027s death. What shall you do with the civilians?\"\n\n\"Ghoul them, use them to help rebuild this city. Once this works, we can make an entire civilization of Zealots, and then... Find the Professor and kill the bastard.\"\n\n\"Solid thinking. But what precisely is the next move?\"\n\n\"Well, where are the surviving Creations?\"\n\n\"Rampaging. Cecilia here was the only one of the virgins to be able to control their forms.\"\n\n\"Rampaging?\"\n\n\"Err, yeah.\" Ragnor replies, confused, \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\n\n\"For the plan to work we need as many live humans as possible to rebuild. Ghouls, remember?\" Without wasting anymore time, you begin to move back in search of the Wolves when you feel a heavy hand on your shoulder, holding you back.\n\n\"Woah there, Vamp. Are you sure you want to stop them? This is the first time they\u0027re in actual control of their lives. Plus, they\u0027re probably too tired to do any real damage. Just let \u0027em have their fun, alright?\"\n",
  "page 275": "\"I can\u0027t kill you people.\" You state, dropping your rifle. It clatters on the floor and you stare at the two leaders-- the hunchback and Ragnor, waiting for them to tell what to do now.\n\nRagnor immediately grins, \"You know circumstances were different, I\u0027m certain we would have made fast friends. But for now, we need to find out how we\u0027re going to survive this thing. You said there are thirty Zealots outside?\" You nod. \"Alright... So who\u0027s leading this STING, you?\"\n\n\"Me and two others.\" You answer. Zadok and Karat.\n\n\"What if...\" Ragnor begins, \"You brought them both here and we finished them off, and then the rest can be slaughtered easily by a surprise attack out of the well?\"\n\n\"I like it,\" you agree, picking up your rifle once more. \"I\u0027ll lead the two of them here where we\u0027ll uh, kill them. And after that we can at least narrow their confused numbers enough to flee, right?\"\n\n\"Right.\" The hunchback states. \"You know, if we survive this... I\u0027m Gideon, remember that.\"\n\n\"Will do.\" You salute, and head back down the hatch. Once down, you jog back to the opening of the well where most of the Zealots remain. Zadok lean over it, hearing you.\n\n\"Where you been? We were about to go down.\"\n\n\"Adventuring. I found the Wolves, but they\u0027re a bigger group than I thought, won\u0027t be able to chase them out alone. Can you and Karat come down with me?\"\n\nKarat grins, jumping down the well without even bothering to use the ledges. \"Let\u0027s do this.\"\n\nSoon Zadok follows, and you find yourself leading the two of them to doom-- who\u0027s you don\u0027t know. Suddenly, you feel something metal and hard bash in the back of your head.\n\nThe action was quick-- but enough to have you staggering forwards.\n\n\"What the hell was that, Karat!\" Zadok yells angrily. Instead of answering immediately, the white-Zealot blasts at you with his rifle, the electron-based ray coiling into your armor, slowly burning you to your death. You feel the armor vibrating and rising in heat, the lightning enveloping you. YOu scream in both surprise and pain, nearly all of your body just spasming in pain.\n\n\"Father Tomas warned me about this, Zadok,\" he guffaws, obviously enjoying your screams of pain, \"Father said that if he tries to bring us in in turns of any sort, you know, tthen he\u0027s trying to put us in a ry to get only two of us down there with the Wolves so he could kill us, like a trap. Good thing this damned demon underestimated the Father, eh?\"\n\nZadok, having trouble hiding how horrified by all of this, merely keeps his mouth closed to a frown, staring at you as you begin to fade...\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 153": "\"I\u0027m sorry, David.\" You state, realizing that Tomas will be killing your ghoul regardless of your choices. With that in mind, you rush the bleeding geezer, hoping to catch him before he can finish off your ghoul. As you thrust your clawed hand at his head, he just barely manages to skewer David.\n\nNever has a kill felt more rewarding. Your hand pierces the fleshy skin-- leaving a flayed face and a collapsed priest. With a grunt, you rush over to David\u0027s side, horrified by the gruesome hole in his chest.\n\nYou don\u0027t really say anything to him, as there is nothing more to say. He fulfilled his duty to you well, and his job, once the City will be taken over, will be easily replaced. But, for now, his death shall allow others of your kind to live. David smiles, and holds your hand firmly. Memories flash of your brief but powerful connection, and we just were beginning to trust each-other...\n\n\nWith a frown, you recognize that at the very least your mission is accomplished, and so you solemnly go to investigate how the rest of the Creations are faring.\n",
  "page 134": "Vampire.\n\nIndeed, that is what Kelso called you. You can still hear his cold, baritone voice explaining it to you. Vampires in the tales of Fantasy are glamorized; nigh-immortal, sexually desirable, powerful. But, while you suppose you are some of those things, in truth, you are not much more than an albino with a lot of health issues. The sun, he said, will damage your skin more than anything else. Any sort of foodstuff can\u0027t be digested anymore by your barely functioning bodily systems. He claims to have an idea of what the \u0027Professor\u0027 was trying to do to us, but for whatever reason, he has dodged the questions anytime you ask.\n\nAny information other than that, Kelso hasn\u0027t revealed. The irking thing is that it is obvious he knows what\u0027s going on, but he consistently acts as if it is in your own good you don\u0027t know what went on.\n\nThe nights have been hard since your escape from the Facility. Most nights you wake up shivering, after all the nightmares you\u0027ve been dealing with. It\u0027s terrifying, and it only makes you wonder what horrible things were done to you at the Facility. You do know that they must have affected your ability to feel. No, not the wishy washy \u0027emotional\u0027 garbage you\u0027d usually expect, but your sense of touch was dulled. While a lot of your senses have been heightened, that one stands out. You feel very little pain from your feet, which is odd; considering how you spent your time running over cracked glass just two days ago, but it seems to have healed recently.\n\n---\n\nWaiting. It should be sunrise by now. Kelso said you shouldn\u0027t get out, as you are a creature of the darkness now. He, on the other hand, has been out for the entire night and then some. You\u0027re not sure what Kelso is hunting for, but you know that you\u0027re beginning to get thirsty. More and more questions begin to build up, and no doubt the bastard won\u0027t answer half of them. Even while you ran with him through the night, running across various landscapes. Most are just a barren dessert, though every once in while you\u0027d pass a half-buried house like this.\n\n\"Bright lights up ahead.\" He said. A city only several miles down. Kelso must have gone there for the clothes he mentioned, but you hope he\u0027s safe....\n",
  "page 255": "Zadok stops to scratch at his stubble at his stubble before answering. \"Funny you should ask. There really seem to be some sort of history between you two which I don\u0027t know of, but Alice is like a sister to me since Annihilation. We found her in one of Kurschner\u0027s Facilities, apparently she interned at the place before that asshole went crazy. Well, crazier. It was one of the Zealots\u0027 first raids, about two weeks before God\u0027s fires ravaged the Earth. She was flustered and confused, and so I, young as I was, convinced Father Tomas to let her in. By then the City was a barricaded City which attracted the religious, and all over the country people came, but the Father liked to inspect the people that came. So I vouched for her, out of sympathy because I don\u0027t think she\u0027 have passed.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Weren\u0027t-chalistenin\u0027?\" He asks, raising an eyebrow, \"She worked side-by-side with Kurschner, Creator of Demons. Damn so-called scientist helped destroy the world with his \u0027solution\u0027.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" So, that\u0027s how she must have known about me...\n\n\"Man, I keep forgetting just how clueless you are,\" he says grimly, \"Simon Kurschner was the man who the progressive government funded to mess with God\u0027s creations, humans. He tried to make humans, \u0027better\u0027, immortal and impervious to disease. The nonbeliever created the demons, see, and Alice, while obviously not in his leagues, was obviously not a good fit with the rest of the Citizens. To this day I\u0027m not sure if she really believes, but thank God things worked out for the best. Father keeps a close watch on her and she was a great addition to the community. Now she lives with me because I guess... I dunno, she was living in a crappy office in the library and she honestly does make the days more bearable. I like my Zealot-buddies but, you know, you need some interaction that is more eh... Permanent. After my promotion Father Tomas gave me that large house since he thinks I\u0027m gonna marry Alice or something, but that\u0027s not it. She\u0027s just nice to have around.\"\n\n\"I guess I understand,\" you reply, \"so you\u0027re just friends with her, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that\u0027s right, you can make your move.\" He guffaws, giving you a pat on the back and laughing once again.\n\nZadok is one odd guy... \"Uh, that\u0027s not what I was getting at, actually.\"\n\n\"Right.\" He answers with a sly grin. \"But don\u0027t worry, after we talk to the Father I think you\u0027ll have plenty of access to having a family. New blood is only a good thing for the town, I say.\"\n\n\"What about you then?\" You laugh back.\n\n\"Maybe when we\u0027re done with the Wolves next door. Then we\u0027ll be safe and maybe I can do something then, but not now.\"\n\n\"Who\u0027re they?\"\n\n\"I think you\u0027ll find out soon enough.\"\n",
  "page 254": "\"Shall we go on, then?\"\n\n\"You bet.\" Zadok answers, pumping a fist. \"Tomas will be very pleased to meet you, good for you to find a place in our civilisation.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" you respond with a grin, \"he\u0027ll be able to give me purpose again.\"\n\nZadok looks at you questioningly before breaking into a laugh, \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s gonna try to baptize you or anything, but uh, hey, whatever works for you, man. I think you\u0027ll fit in fine hahaha.\"\n\nThe two of you, with Zadok in front, head up the grey concrete steps leading up to the Chapel. Your feet feel surprisingly cold as they thud against the rocky steps, as if repelling you from the neon-Cross ahead. Too far along, you trudge on with Zadok. The large stainless-steel doors daunt over you as you knock.\n\nYou bang three times on the metal surface, and await your judgment. The Zealot beside you pats you on the back, gleeful that you came with him. You wait several moments in silence until a bald, heavy-set man answers the door with a warm smile.\n\n\"Zadok! A bit early, I see. No matter-- the Father is finishing up anyway. And who\u0027s the friend beside you? I must confess, I haven\u0027t met personally with everybody here since I was Chosen, but I certainly have no recollection of this fellow...\"\n\n\"He\u0027s a newbie. That\u0027s part of the reason we\u0027re here-- didn\u0027t want to keep the man waiting. Courteousy, eh, Alon?\"\n\n\"Of course... Right then,\" the Monk mutters while eyeing you curiously, \"Well, come on in, quick! It\u0027s chilly outside!\"\n\nYou hadn\u0027t even noticed.\n\nThe two of you continue on, thanking the monk and entering the complex. Inside, a gathering of 10 chanting monks stop the waving of their arms to face you, each with the same curious look. \"Who is this, Brother?\"\n\n\"I already went over this. Alon can go tell you guys. Now, where\u0027s the Priest?\"\n\n\"We are not at liberty to state.\" The 10 chant in sync.\n\n\"Great,\" Zadok nods, \"We\u0027ll wait in his office, then. Thanks all!\"\n\nYou follow Zadok into a musty velvet room, bookshelves lining the walls, each packed with books in more languages than you can count. One pretty obvious one is facing toward you, labeled, \"Nosferatu: Satan\u0027s Knights\" and something else along those lines. You un-suspiciously lean in towards it slightly to make more of those particular set of books out, only to find demon banishing rituals and th like. With a sigh, you take a metal seat beside Zadok, in front of a rotting desk, waiting for Father Tomas.\n\n\"Do you know what he\u0027s doing?\" You ask, trying to pass the time.\n\n\"Hah, yeah I do. But it isn\u0027t the most holy of rooms, I\u0027d say. It\u0027s best not to say, though you can probably make it out.\"\n\n\"A... Bathroom?\"\n\nZadok nods. Several moments pass before he speaks up again. \"Oof, hey, man, I forgot to get the, uh... The armor you found...\" As his eyes dart around, you know where he\u0027s going with this.\n\n\"You need to go get it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it\u0027s important the Priest gets it soon. You mind if I make a dash for it?\"\n\n\"And leave me alone with the Father?\"\n\n\"Well, uh, yeah. Unless you really want me to be there with ya. Kinda weird, but I get it. New guy, gets a bit nervous. Right?\"\n",
  "page 136": "\"You\u0027ll have your own choice of death today, Tomas. But I will honor the deal we made tonight, and I hope, for your sake, that you honor yours.\"\n\nFather Tomas stares at you with that crazy eye of his, nodding and cocking his head for you to move towards the door before he can release your friend. With an angry sigh, you move past the bloody corpses piled up in the room and hang by the front door.\n\nAs David is dropped by the Father, you stand up, ready to continue your mission-- now, to Zealot HQ. David stares at you meekly, trying his best to grunt loudly. You wave to him, expecting him to follow, before opening the front door once again. By now you recognize that the sirens are still blaring, which means that Zealots should be piling up in the streets-- but the street you see has nobody walking. Though you do hear voices from somewhere far to the left, you can\u0027t help but notice that Zealot HQ has its door open.\n\nAm I too late? You wonder, as you make haste by running into the building, looking around for someone to waste your adrenaline on. Inside, you see perhaps three half-dressed Zealots yawning and loitering about, seemingly confident that this is a false alarm.\n\nThis means nothing to you, and you rush one-- kick him into a nearby table, deck the other one with a heavy punch, and angrily bite into the last one\u0027s hand when he tries to strangle you from behind. It\u0027s over in a matter of minutes, but you suddenly feel like you\u0027re being... Watched.\n\n\"Bravo, Demon.\" Comes the voice. From across the room you can see a white-armored Zealot, taller and more sizeable than most you\u0027ve seen. He carries with him a silver sword, less blunt than Tomas\u0027s though it doesn\u0027t seem to resonate with the same energy. \"I see you were able to butcher my friends quickly enough, but somehow I doubt you\u0027ll manage to take someone like myself as easily.\"\n\n\"Who\u0027re you?\" You roar, setting yourself in front of him.\n\n\"Zealot Karat, Chief of the Zealots.\" He grins, \"At least, until the real Chief comes home from your clever diversion.\n\n\"If.\" You state, bluffing. I have no idea what happened with Gideon and the other Zealots... \"If, he comes back.\"\n\nKatar doesn\u0027t bother answering, and instead positions himself with his silver katana in an aggressive fighting position. Once again, you find yourself in a tactical situation that you need to decide how to approach. You need to be careful about his silver sword and make sure to finish the fight quickly, but he\u0027s probably more spry than that bastard, Tomas.\n",
  "page 257": "The Zealot takes a seat beside you once again. \"Alright then, but you owe me one, man.\"\n\nThe two of you sit around for a small while, Zadok patiently tapping his gauntleted fingers on the desk while you worry about the Father. What if he tries to kill me? I kill him, of course, but where would I run? And if he even does accept me, what then?\n\nMoments later, the sound of shuffling feet is heard. They\u0027re slow though refined-- obviously from an older man. You turn to face the only opening to the room when a pruned, weathered-out face with a hooked nose peers past the door way.\n\n\"Zadok? What are you doing here so early?\" The man enters the room, both hands clasped together behind his back. He wears a sky-blue robe and a red skullcap, his walking pattern oddly perky for one of his age. \"And I see you brought a, ahem, friend?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father Tomas, sir!\" Zado reports, standing up and giving a slight bow to the priest. Following suit, you stand up to bow as well.\n\nUgh, why am I so hungry?\n\n\"So, want to tell me what this is all about?\" Tomas asks with an odd chuckle, motioning you to your seat. \"Please, sit. This will probably take longer than most meetings, hahaha!\"\n\nAs all three of you get comfortable (the Father taking out his spectacles from a drawer behind the desk), Zadok starts, \"Well, this morning I was doing a routine gate-check in substitute for a Zealot who caught a nasty cold--\"\n\n\"He was quarantined?\" Tomas asks, rubbing at his faintly-bearded chin.\n\n\"Yes. Saul gave himself up easily enough, nobody but his wife was in contact with him-- and she\u0027s fine. So the Medics were called in and he was brought to the Hospital where the rest of the sick are.\"\n\n\"And how are they doing?\"\n\n\"Slowly but surely they\u0027re getting better. At first I wasn\u0027t so sure of the ban of antihistamines was a good idea, but it seemed to work out in the end.\" Zadok nods.\n\n\"Good good, then what?\"\n\nSince when did I start salivating...?\n\n\"Then this guy,\" Zadok pats at your shoulder, \"appeared out of nowhere, barely breathing and seemingly pretty dehydrated. He passed out shortly after I brought him into the house.\"\n\n\"And why wasn\u0027t I informed immediately?\"\n\nYou continue to silently watch as they talk about you, \"Well, he was unconscious for a long time. He woke only a couple of hours ago, where I waited until our meeting to introduce you two. Additionally, Alice wanted him to be relaxed before talking to new faces, and you know how she is...\"\n\nTomas laughs, \"Indeed I do. So that\u0027s probably he\u0027s wearing such rebellious clothing. I assume he got some hand-me-downs?\"\n\nThe two Zealots laugh at the not-so witty comment for several moments before the Father faces you, finally. \"Alright then, what can you tell me about yourself?\"\n\n\"He doesn\u0027t remember--\"\n\n\"Let him speak for himself.\" The Father commands, his kindly eyes suddenly narrowing in your direction.\n\n\"Well,\" you begin, \"I definitely don\u0027t remember my name, nor from where I actually am.\"\n\n\"Then what are you doing here?\" Tomas asks, his eyes suddenly turning to Zadok, which prompts him to give a thumbs up.\n\n\"Several reasons. For one, this was, uh, the only human community as far as I could see. While I don\u0027t remember anything but random fragments of my past, I knew that this is a place of safety. And so I fled here.\"\n\n\"From where?\"\n\n\"I... I\u0027ll get to it. It\u0027s complicated.\" Fight the beast, man. Control the hunger.\n\n\"Oh really?\" the Father begins, raising a brow.  \"So, tell me as much as you know of your story, wanderer.\"\n\nHow should I go about this? If I tell them about killing the \u0027Sebastian\u0027 guy that I probably accidentally killed, they\u0027ll probably kill me... But wouldn\u0027t lying go against the entire point of me seeking Tomas\u0027s aid? I want to set things right, but then again, I can\u0027t set things right by dying. Damn it... There must be a way to appeal to these guys...\n",
  "page 135": "\"I\u0027m sorry, David.\" You state, realizing that Tomas will be killing your ghoul regardless of your choices. With that in mind, you rush the bleeding geezer, hoping to catch him before he can finish off your ghoul. As you thrust your clawed hand at his head, he just barely manages to skewer David.\n\nNever has a killing felt more rewarding. Your hand pierces the fleshy skin-- leaving a flayed face and a collapsed priest. With a grunt, you rush over to David\u0027s side, horrified by the gruesome hole in his chest.\n\nYou don\u0027t really say anything to him, as there is nothing more to say. He fulfilled his duty to you well, and his job, once the City will be taken over, will be easily replaced. But, for now, his death shall allow others of your kind to live. David smiles, and holds your hand firmly. Memories flash of your brief but powerful connection, Oh, and we just were getting close, too...\n\nAs David closes his eyes, you stand up, ready to continue your mission-- now, to Zealot HQ. You make your way through the piles of corpses to the front door of the Church, more angry than anything else at this point. By now you recognize that the sirens are still blaring, which means that Zealots should be piling up in the streets-- but the street you see has nobody walking. Though you do hear voices from somewhere far to the left, you can\u0027t help but notice that Zealot HQ has its door open.\n\nAm I too late?

  "page 256": "Zadok almost instantly replies, \"God, obviously.\"\n\nYou hold back your laughter-- though you aren\u0027t sure why you find it amusing, \"No, I mean, how is it governed? Does Tomas, err, Father Tomas just lead everybody and you all listen?\"\n\nThe Zealot doesn\u0027t bother withholding his laughter, \"Of course not! The Father and his disciples deal with the matters of direction; what the people need to stock up on, morale, the like...\"\n\n\"Disciples?\"\n\n\"His disciples were voted in by the citizens-- basically just regular people known to be God-fearing and willing to give their life to studying mysticism and religion with the Father. They\u0027re more or less monks. Anyway, the religion-division works with the Zealot leaders-- Chief, myself, and Karat. Ranking in descending order. Father Tomas actually has more influence than us, since we mostly just keep the peace, collect taxes outlined in the Holy Writings, and hun-- but that\u0027s for a good reason. The Zealots fight for God while the Father leads people to serve God. Him and the disciples discuss laws that are introduced by his weekly sermons, and we make sure they are enforced. Thankfully, there is little crime around here. We realize that Gd is always watching, so even with a small police force that\u0027s usually already divided between tasks and even less ability to find criminals thanks to our limited tech, we get a lot of sharing of necessities between neighbors and practically no murder. The City as it is now is actually pretty young-- I mean, it\u0027s only been what, 7 years since Annihilation? But we get by...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, trying to process everything, \"Annihilation? Demons? What happened?\"\n\n\"Well, immorality and God\u0027s justice. We\u0027re simply paying for the after-affects of meddling with God\u0027s creations and allowing evil to poison our youth.\" Zadok stops facing you to look up at the moon, before adding, \"It was the equivalent of The Flood, but with Fire and brimstone, as prophesied in the Writings.\"\n\nOkay... \"How did the people here survive, then? And, uh, what are the demons left?\"\n\n\"People believing in the Rapture made bunkers way before it happened, saw some flares after the fallout and heard of the only City that missed the explosion. We used to get a lot of refugees, Father Tomas took a lot of us in. But we haven\u0027t had anybody new for years. Reason why you\u0027re such a mystery, eh?\" He ribs you in the side with a weak chuckle, \"But there\u0027s still demons-- the ones that helped bring about this Calamity, that are able to survive under these conditions. Bloodsuckers, shape-shifters, more. That\u0027s what Father Tomas calls them, and I\u0027ve killed the buggers up close. Vile, insane creatures that can plow through an entire battalion of Zealots. Most don\u0027t talk, and the ones that do plead innocence and sentience before they swallow your best friend whole. That\u0027s why hunt them-- unholy freaks of nature, see. They dig burrows in the dirt, trying to hide. But we\u0027re weeding out the ones in the area. In the seven years we\u0027ve been here, Father told us not to leave the premises, but now he\u0027s changed his policies, wants to find other living populations and such. Which is good, this place needed change.\"\n\nYou only nod before taking the conversation elsewhere.\n\n \n",
  "page 138": "Fueling your rage into reserve energy, to be used when necessary, you plant your feet to the ground, readying yourself for the Zealot.\n\nKarat laughs, lazily letting his sword\u0027s tip fall to the ground. The man\u0027s bravery (or is it bravado?) astonishes you, \"So, you fear God\u0027s might?\"\n\n\"Maybe, but not your\u0027s.\" Comes your sharp answer.\n\n\"Then how come you haven\u0027t readied yourself to attack? Are you worried you won\u0027t make the cut?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m simply more confident in your ability to leave yourself open, thanks.\"\n\nKarat shrugs, \"Suit yourself, Vampire. Perhaps you shall find fear of God\u0027s servant instaed.\" With that, he raises his silver katana, it gleaming in the neon lights of the building. His stance confirmed, aggressive, he poises to attack. The white Zealot advances, giving a wide and open slash in the air to test you.\n\nOf course, you pass with barely any effort-- just a turn of the neck. Karat laughs once again, and attempts to bum-rush you-- but your defensive stance gives you an advantage, and with clever foot work you grip his wrist, pull, and flip him onto a nearby table. It cracks under the pressure of an armored giant slammed onto it, but the Zealot gets back up and, still gripping his katana, sends a swift vertical cut down at you. You attempt to dodge, but you\u0027d admit that you didn\u0027t expect him to get back up so fast, and the slash sticks into your shoulder-armor, just barely missing your skin.\n\nAs lucky as you were back there, now Karat has the initiative. He pulls the sword back, grabbing you with it and sending a heavy boot at your stomach. You begin to tip over, but you\u0027re sent backwards by a heavy, gauntleted punch to your nose-- which sends you back several feet and onto the ground. Your vision blurs slightly though you manage to get up before Karat manages to land a more accurate cut at your forehead, and manage to grapple him, using the core of your body to push him back. Your nose for some reason still bloodied, you continue to prefer close quarters, where your pinging head won\u0027t hamper your vision. Using the anger built up, you manage to grab hold of his helmet with both hands, and squeeze.\n\nThe man screams, much like your ghoul did not so long ago. They all do, the humans scream in pain, struggle and kick in their last moments. And as the helmet crumples up and the man goes limp, you embrace your inner demon and drink him dry. The blood is refreshing and your vision clears, but then you notice why his armor is so bright. Must be inlaid with silver...\n\nYou shrug. Does it really matter if the Zealots have been inlaying their weapons with silver? The Wolves can take care of themselves...\n\n\nRegardless, realizing that there aren\u0027t any Zealots left in the building, you leave to see how the war is going. Mission Accomplished.\n",
  "page 258": "\"No, you can go.\" You slowly state.\n\nZadok nods, \"Right on. I\u0027ll be back soon, don\u0027t worry.\"\n\nYou smile, trying to hide your nervousness, \"Nothing to worry about anyway, right?\"\n\n\"Not unless you got something to hide,\" He laughs, already heading out.\n\nOh man...\n\nIt doesn\u0027t take too long before you hear the slow plods of an obviously older man. You immediately stand up when a pruned face peeks into the room. \"Excuse me, but I must ask, what are you doing in my study, Godless one?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m not Godless!\" You pipe up, giving a short bow out of reflex. The man\u0027s head, covered by a red skullcap, is soon followed by the man\u0027s robed figure. You notice, that although the priest is obviously aged, he seems surprisingly perky when it comes to his steps. \"You\u0027re uh, Father Tomas, I presume?\"\n\nHe laughs, \"You may presume that, child. You\u0027re new here, I see. \u0027Godless\u0027 is what I refer to people dressed like, well, you.\"\n\nThis suddenly makes you feel self conscious, and you look down at your haggard jacket and barely tied sneakers.\n\n\"Eyes up here boy,\" he snaps, lifting his index figure to his eye, \"I apologize for assuming, though you should explain what exactly you are doing here.\"\n\n\"I am a newcomer to the City--\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah. I don\u0027t remember really anything of my past, but when I came Zadok took me in.\"\n\n\"Ahuh.\" Tomas says, nodding repeatedly. \"Please, take a seat then. It seems like this may be a while.\" The old man gestures to your chair before shuffling to his own behind the desk. \"Now, ahem, you came in when, exactly?\"\n\nYou take your seat only until after he sits, \"Must have been this morning.\"\n\n\"So what have you been doing up until now?\"\n\n\"Mostly, uh, resting. Apparently I became unconscious when I saw Zadok.\"\n\n\"Alright. Do you remember where you\u0027re from, or any sort of name?\"\n\n\"No, Father. Which is part of the reason why I came to you. I\u0027ve been thrust into this world head-first, and I have no clue what\u0027s going on.\"\n\nThe Father stares at you oddly as he reaches into his drawers. Almost immediately you tense up-- though he only takes out a pair of spectacles and a thumb-tack. He delicately grasps the glasses, laying them softly on the ridge of his nose before leaning towards you.\n\n\"How does...\" he starts, making a stabbing motion-- so swift that you can\u0027t stop it from thudding against you chest-- \"THIS feel?\"\n\nWhile you feel nothing, you notice his wrinkled hand tensed up in a fist, as if he slashed at you with a knife. He lets go-- and behold the thumb-tack remains less than an inch inside of your neck.\n\n\"What the heck was that, Priest?\" You shout, alarmed and standing at attention.\n\n\"You\u0027re one of them!\" Tomas snarls, his eyes darting across the room. \"He sent you here, didn\u0027t he? To disrupt the balance? Speak before I slay you!\"\n\nWhile you don\u0027t find the geezer particularly threatening, you manage to politely state, \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about, Father.\"\n\n\"Like hell you do, demon.\" Tomas reaches into his robe, taking out an upside-down 6-foot cross and wielding it as a sword. Instinctively, your claws begin to release and your jaw enlarging in response to your fangs. You howl at the Father, the beast within fed up with his superstitious lies (not to mention his act of aggression.) Still, you barely are able to notice when the lithe geezer swings his silver bar at your forehead-- slamming you to the ground. Vaguely, you notice Monks grabbing at your ankels and pulling you through the back of the office, where the red wall flips into some sort of bright lab.\n\nNext thing you know, you find yourself tied to a chair, bright lights frying your retinas in a blue room. You try to break out though to no avail, only gaining marks on your forearms in reward for the effort.\n\nAt the corner of your bloodless eye, you notice the ever-loyal Zadok behind one of the walls, attempting to break down the apparent entrance, his fist pounding the viewing glass as his muffled shouts are heard. You begin to hear the sounds of his attempts, as if he was slowly succeeding at breaking through.\n\nBut alas, it it too late...\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 139": "Still angered by the death of your friend, you quickly lunge at the man, his mouth still moving. Karat moves out of the way, just in time.\n\n\"You\u0027re a feisty little demon aren\u0027t you?\" He laughs, readying his katana to slash. You don\u0027t waste a second when you swipe at him again, your claws forming from under the gauntlet. He dodges it again-- and counters, sending a flurry of swipes in your direction. Even though his advancing attacks barely give you enough time to dodge, you try to maintain being on the offensive.\n\nA horizontal slash causes you to crouch, and the next vertical one makes you have to move to the side. Again and again this cycle continues, and you feel as if he might be getting tired. When he begins to slow down even the slightest bit, you add a kick to your crouching, sweeping him off of his feet. He falls over, but not before  a wild swing cuts at your cheek. While only a small amount of pus dribbles out of your cheek. you realize that this marks something worse. Still, you make an attempt to jump onto him, and strangle the bastard to death, but even on the floor Karat manages to use his sword at it\u0027s fullest, and this time, his sword is pushed with enough force to pierce your body armor.\n\nOn the plus side, you did manage to end the fight relatively quickly.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 0": "Vampire.\n\nIndeed, that is what Kelso called you. You can still hear his cold, baritone voice explaining it to you. Vampires in the tales of Fantasy are glamorized; nigh-immortal, sexually desirable, powerful. But, while you suppose you are some of those things, in truth, you are not much more than an albino with a lot of health issues. The sun, he said, will damage your skin more than anything else. Any sort of foodstuff can\u0027t be digested anymore by your barely functioning bodily systems. He claims to have an idea of what the \u0027Professor\u0027 was trying to do to us, but for whatever reason, he has dodged the questions anytime you ask.\n\nAny information other than that, Kelso hasn\u0027t revealed. The irking thing is that it is obvious he knows what\u0027s going on, but he consistently acts as if it is in your own good you don\u0027t know what went on.\n\nThe nights have been hard since your escape from the Facility. Most nights you wake up shivering, after all the nightmares you\u0027ve been dealing with. It\u0027s terrifying, and it only makes you wonder what horrible things were done to you at the Facility. You do know that they must have affected your ability to feel. No, not the wishy washy \u0027emotional\u0027 garbage you\u0027d usually expect, but your sense of touch was dulled. While a lot of your senses have been heightened, that one stands out. You feel very little pain from your feet, which is odd; considering how you spent your time running over cracked glass just two days ago, but it seems to have healed recently.\n\n---\n\nWaiting. It should be sunrise by now. Kelso said you shouldn\u0027t get out, as you are a creature of the darkness now. He, on the other hand, has been out for the entire night and then some. You\u0027re not sure what Kelso is hunting for, but you know that you\u0027re beginning to get thirsty. More and more questions begin to build up, and no doubt the bastard won\u0027t answer half of them. Even while you ran with him through the night, running across various landscapes. Most are just a barren dessert, though every once in while you\u0027d pass a half-buried house like this.\n\n\"Bright lights up ahead.\" He said. A city only several miles down. Kelso must have gone there for the clothes he mentioned, but you hope he\u0027s safe....\n",
  "page 260": "You begin to describe the situations you were put through, just with different names and locations skewed. Furthermore, you weave into it that a madman was chasing you through the desert with a description similar to Kelso, in hopes of putting their suspicion onto him-- not you. Other than that, it indeed was vaguely similar to the truth.\n\n\"In summarization, I woke up in one of those abandoned houses buried in the sand, several miles out from here, where a man was tending to several cut I had. I spent a day there, listening to the crazy-man rambling on and on about how the Church was going to murder him and his kind. I\u0027m still not sure what he meant by that, but I don\u0027t... This may sound odd, but I don\u0027t think he was, uh, human?\"\n\n\"You know the crazy-man\u0027s name?\" The Father asks nodding his head with seeming understanding.\n\n\"He called himself \u0027Kal\u0027, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s his real name.\"\n\n\"So that\u0027s all you remember?\"\n\n\"Yeah. But... What now, Father?\"\n\nHe smiles, \"My child, now you can go to rest. Our meeting is concluded, yes? To be resumed when the sun rises at the middle?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly.\" Zadok says, raising a hand. \"When this man came here he was wearing Zealot-issue armor. He said that he found it stuck in the sand, and if I\u0027m right in my assumptions, I think we can find out what happened to Sebastian.\"\n\nTomas motions for you to leave. \"This is distressing, though hopeful news. Alright, child, we will discuss your state of citizenship on the morrow. Zadok-- show me the armor as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\nOh shit, the armor! But, I mean, how much can the Father get from it anyway? I should be safe, I hope...\n\nYou return to the house with Zadok, who leaves you to your room as he walks away the Zealot-armor. Worrying-still, you begin to meditate only to notice Alice, teary-eyed, standing by your room once again.\n\n\"Uh, what\u0027s up?\"\n\n\"You spoke to the Father.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but, uh, he didn\u0027t kill me.\"\n\n\"You need to watch yourself, my love... This was a mistake.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, she leaves.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to meditate the rest of the night, but you find yourself exhausted for whatever reason. You may or may not blame it on being close to too many blooded humans, as the thought of drinking the blood of anything has slowly begun to plague your mind. Regardless, you doze off for the night.\n\nThe morning after you wake to the sudden sounds of thunder and bright light in your room.\n\n\"Liar, murderer, and tool of Satan. Dispose of this rat!\" the voice of Father Tomas cries from behind dozens of stygian-armored Zealots, each wielding large, blocky rifles with tusks at the end. While marveling it all yet not understanding the sudden spectacle, your body is soon subject to large bursts of electricity, and after your body jerks and burns with all the raw energy, you slump off your bed, unconscious.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 141": "Fueling your rage into reserve energy, to be used when necessary, you plant your feet to the ground, readying yourself for the Zealot.\n\nKarat laughs, lazily letting his sword\u0027s tip fall to the ground. The man\u0027s bravery (or is it bravado?) astonishes you, \"So, you fear God\u0027s might?\"\n\n\"Maybe, but not your\u0027s.\" Comes your sharp answer.\n\n\"Then how come you haven\u0027t readied yourself to attack? Are you worried you won\u0027t make the cut?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m simply more confident in your ability to leave yourself open, thanks.\"\n\nKarat shrugs, \"Suit yourself, Vampire. Perhaps you shall find fear of God\u0027s servant instaed.\" With that, he raises his silver katana, it gleaming in the neon lights of the building. His stance confirmed, aggressive, he poises to attack. The white Zealot advances, giving a wide and open slash in the air to test you.\n\nOf course, you pass with barely any effort-- just a turn of the neck. Karat laughs once again, and attempts to bum-rush you-- but your defensive stance gives you an advantage, and with clever foot work you grip his wrist, pull, and flip him onto a nearby table. It cracks under the pressure of an armored giant slammed onto it, but the Zealot gets back up and, still gripping his katana, sends a swift vertical cut down at you. You attempt to dodge, but you\u0027d admit that you didn\u0027t expect him to get back up so fast, and the slash sticks into your shoulder-armor, just barely missing your skin.\n\nAs lucky as you were back there, now Karat has the initiative. He pulls the sword back, grabbing you with it and sending a heavy boot at your stomach. You begin to tip over, but you\u0027re sent backwards by a heavy, gauntleted punch to your nose-- which sends you back several feet and onto the ground. Your vision blurs slightly though you manage to get up before Karat manages to land a more accurate cut at your forehead, and manage to grapple him, using the core of your body to push him back. Your nose for some reason still bloodied, you continue to prefer close quarters, where your pinging head won\u0027t hamper your vision. Using the anger built up, you manage to grab hold of his helmet with both hands, and squeeze.\n\nThe man screams, much like your ghoul did not so long ago. They all do, the humans scream in pain, struggle and kick in their last moments. And as the helmet crumples up and the man goes limp, you embrace your inner demon and drink him dry. The blood is refreshing and your vision clears, but then you notice why his armor is so bright. Must be inlaid with silver...\n\nYou shrug. Does it really matter if the Zealots have been inlaying their weapons with silver? The Wolves can take care of themselves...\n\n\nRegardless, realizing that there aren\u0027t any Zealots left in the building, you leave to see how the war is going. Mission Successful. You get up, and stretch, getting ready to make your way to see how the Wolves fared.\n\nSuddenly... \"DIE DEMON!\" Comes the familiar thundering, though gravely voice.  You hear and feel the heavy thud of a metal beam smashing into your skull. You double over, barely conscious, but you\u0027re able to make out the blue robe of the Father, now striped with rust-colored blood in front of you. \"While it is saddening to think that you got this far, I am happy to relinquish you of your dark life-force, as I did to the man whom you corrupted. Good night.\"\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 262": "These are religious folk... There has to be respect with forwardness, hopefully.\n\nYou take a deep breath before beginning the story. \"I warn you both, this will be... Hard to hear, in it\u0027s entirety. But I intend to tell you all of the truth, so you can accept me for what I am.\"\n\nThey both lean forward; interested, but do not interrupt.\n\n\"The furthest back I remember clearly is waking up in a Facility, test tubes cracked open... And there I remember lying, barely conscious when a man reached out for me. He told me that the Zealots were coming-- a term he only explained to me afterwards and I took his hand and we ran in the night, the Facility burning behind us.\n\nHappens to be I still don\u0027t know what the Facility was for, but I can only imagine it was used to experiment on human test subjects to create the abominations that currently walk the Earth today, ones like myself. Kelso, the man who saved me from being killed by your hands, told me about myself. I am a Vampire of sorts, I\u0027m a blood sucker who\u0027s afraid of the sun. I am here to confess my sins to the Father, and my very worst sin I shall recount to you at this moment.\"\n\nAt this the two Zealots clench their fists, with Zadok staring back down on them and the Father staring right back at you. \"The man screamed for mercy... I remember his cries, his mentioning of his family... But I didn\u0027t care. Kelso forced me to feast on him, so that I could learn to be like him. And I can\u0027t lie-- it was good. The blood filled by veins with newfound vigor, and just enough that I could run away from my sire, my master: Kelso. With the Zealot\u0027s armor on my back I had the gall to come to your gates and get shelter.. But I want to apologize, for all I\u0027ve done. I am at your mercy, Father...\"\n\nIt\u0027s odd, but you feel as if water had been forming at the tips of your eye-lids, a new experience. \"Please help me.\"\n\nAs you finish your tale, the Father begins to reach for the inside of his robe up until Zadok raises his hand. \"Father, there is merit to what the Cursed-One is saying. He\u0027s telling the full-truth, good and bad. We are a religious lot, aren\u0027t we? Sebastian was like a younger brother to us at HQ. He has-- had, kids and a wife... You know that it\u0027s not easy for me to forgive this bastard, but why not let him atone and serve?\"\n\nFather Tomas\u0027s eyes narrow angrily at you before finally relaxing. \"You believe this... Creature,\" he spits, \"deserves to be of our ranks? A leech, sired by the devil\u0027s hand... Simon Kurschner. Zadok, my boy... Do you really think there is hope for one like him?\"\n\n\"You\u0027ve preached that there\u0027s hope for everyone--\" Zadok starts, before being interrupted by you.\n\n\"If I couldn\u0027t be reformed then God wouldn\u0027t have delivered me to you, would he?\" You ask, trying to give a weak smile. This will work out...\n\nFather Tomas stares at you blankly. Suddenly, his lip curls into a smile as he begins to cackle incessantly.\n\n\"Fine! You want to atone, eh? Well I\u0027ll make you atone, don\u0027t you worry... I\u0027ll make a true Zealot out of you...\"\n",

I knew that this was the only City around, and so I went in the morning to the gates, only to fall unconscious due to the exhaustion. Zadok took me in, and I told him I waned him to bring me here once I woke up.\"\n\nSilence plagues the room as Father Tomas narrows his eyes at you. \"And why is it that one of the accursed wishes to speak to me?\"\n\nYou attempt to gulp-- only causing you to cough several times. \"I want another chance.

  "page 167": "The lupine language is an annoyingly complex one. Even though the alphabet is blocky and primitive, it\u0027s amazingly complicated. If you were to guess, the language was probably formed from several other ones-- particularly English, German, and Latin. Or perhaps not-- it\u0027s just that foreign to you. Over the months of relative tranquility you\u0027ve picked up most of it, though the constant use of prefixes, suffixes and roots still mess you up greatly. \n\nAs Ragnor puts it, \"It\u0027s a beautiful language, simple but elegant. It\u0027s confusing to learn though, I\u0027ll give you that.\"\n\nYou were given chalk and were set in some sort of rundown school, where they still used blackboards. Shamino-- who\u0027s just slightly younger than yourself, pretty much takes advantage of the opportunity to finally teach you something. He forces you to draw the assortment of curved lines in specific orders, with seemingly random dots in order to emphasize expression.\n\nProbably the most interesting part of the alphabet is that some letters are simply not used in the English language. Fittingly, they require use of the back of the throat to pronounce, almost like a choked howl.\n\nThey say that they formed it to spite the Professor, but you\u0027re not really sure how it would accomplish that. It seems that it would be more useful as a secret-code language if needed.  That\u0027s probably what it was at first though, assuming the Wolves were always this close in their Facility.\n\nIt\u0027s fascinating to you, though, that the Wolves were close enough to build this language together. Unfortunately, they seem to share a link together that you don\u0027t have, a connection that they all have. Even with the newly added benefit of speaking their tongue, most of them still find you aloof to them, simply a leader- but little else.\n",

From what you can tell, the ones you know are probably Gideon, Kelso, and... God, what was his name, Stein? They must have been the only ones who survived the Facility raids. The rest likely died.\n\nThe Professor-- Sion Kurschner, apparently was known to experiment on himself as well as others. No pictures detail him, though it notes that he was of Germanic background, though American-born and raised. A lot of things detailing him are ripped, so it\u0027s hard to get anything useful.\n\nYou flip through the last folder-- and something catches your eye. Eureka! It\u0027s a last sighting report. Apparently he was seen by Zealot scouts about a year ago, before the Church-City raid you ran. They saw a man in a white lab coat circle around the desert, then disappear. They say he went south, where they occasionally heard reports from another City that (used?) to be there. No other reference to that city is made anywhere else, but... This is the best lead we\u0027ve gotten. Ever.\n\n\"Ragnor, take a look at this! In about a week we should be able to send a team in that direction in search of the lost City!\"\n\nWe\u0027ll find you, Simon Kurschner. It\u0027s just a matter of time now...\n",

You get closer to her once more, \"Alright, so, you got me up here, finally, but as much as I like spending time with you, I think you need to tell me why you wanted to sleep on the roof tonight.\"\n\nCecilia turns away, \"I need to see something.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"You\u0027ll see.\"\n\nIn awkward silence you wait.

  "page 174": "As days pass, you find yourself closer and closer as to finding out about Simon Kurschner\u0027s whereabouts. Supposedly, there used to be another City perhaps 40 miles south that he was sighted moving in the direction of not too long ago-- before the battle of First Blood. You\u0027re not certain how much time elapsed since his sighting and F.B., but it can\u0027t have been too long. Of course, Ragnor doesn\u0027t hesitate to call it optimism-- but hey, maybe I\u0027ll finally catch that man and bring him to justice.\n\nThe only real problem with it is that 40 miles is not a single night trip, and you\u0027d have to bring a lot of reinforcements (in case things get rough) and watch out for day-break. You\u0027ve already decided that your ideal group would be Shamino, Nordim, Darla and yourself- while Cecilia will remain safe and watch over the City with Ragnor for the several days you\u0027d be gone. \n\nYou shake your head furiously, trying to get your mind off of this-- Ragnor already agreed, even if he doubted your primary objective would succeed, he still believed that you could probably loot the City for supplies. Win/win on all accounts. Either way, right now you need to go to another council meeting.\n\nThe City has changed a lot during the 12 months, from an ugly, though bright dystopian gloom to a more country-like town devoid of all those horrible neon signs; in the desert. Small markets exist mostly selling fruits like cactus or something, which is necessary to everybody but you-- and yet you\u0027re in charge that economically things are going well. Thankfully, the religious bigots that are now your servants are very big on helping each-other up, so you don\u0027t need to watch over it too much.\n\nYou walk up the steps of what used to be the Church-- now just a larger building with a shattered Cross on the front. You open the door, and all of your apostles stand up in your presence. With courteous, you bow to them back, and approach the middle of their gathering.\n\n\"Behold, one of us is missing,\" you murmur, counting only six excluding yourself. \"Where is Simon?\"\n\n\"Coming back from scouting, lord.\" Comes the response from Darla.\n\nI hate that title. \"Don\u0027t call me that, please.\" You say, glaring at her. \"He should be here by now, it\u0027s midday, isn\u0027t it?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nYou sigh, and take a seat. You wait for several minutes before the door is flung open by Simon, a young and thin Wolf-- fit for a scout.\n\n\"I got something!\" He shouts, gasping for breath.\n\nRagnor and yourself instantly get up from your posh arm-chairs, making a loud stomping noise. \"What?\" Ragnor asks, \"Elaborate, child.\"\n\nSimon closes the door behind him before continuing, \"About thirty-or-so Zealots, rising from the South. They\u0027re being led by an unarmored man. Couldn\u0027t make out his face, but I saw them several miles down.\"\n\nYou meet Ragnor\u0027s eyes, both of you baffled by what this could possibly mean. \"What took you so long to get back?\" You question him-- it\u0027s not the Zealots you\u0027re worried about, it\u0027s on the identity of the unarmored man leading them. It can\u0027t be the Professor... Right?\n\n\"Um, I got... Lost, yeah.\"\n\n\"Lost? The City is easily the most noticeable thing in the desert. It\u0027s pretty hard to get \u0027lost\u0027.\"\n\nThe teenager begins to shake, \"I got, um, sidetracked by this snake...\"\n\nRagnor sighs, cutting him off, \"It is no matter. Vamp, let\u0027s meet the incoming Zealots. We can take them on easily if we wanted to, but I think that we\u0027re both more interested in seeing whomever\u0027s leading them.\"\n\nYou nod, motioning Simon to take a seat. \"The rest of you,\n",

You know that \u0027title\u0027 ticks me off.\"\n\n\"Which is kinda why I like saying it,\" Ragnor jokes with a grin. Seeing your discomfort, his face turns serious again, \"It\u0027s necessary, though. We need a leader, especially as time passes and the Ghouls will begin to stop being so submissive to us. You\u0027re a hero to us, the Wolves, whether you like it or not.\"\n\nYou nod, not really sure how to explain your discomfort to it. Out of everybody you interact with, only 2 are really casual with you-- Cecilia and Ragnor. To be honest, you\u0027d rather being casual with everyone, but it\u0027s simply not possible when you\u0027re constantly being referred to as \u0027Vampire Lord\u0027 like some sort of king. Which... I sort of am, even if my kingdom simply consists of genetically engineered advisors, angry plebeians, and a barb-wire fence.\n\nYou continue through the streets of Home, moving South as per the direction of a makeshift compass one of the Ghouls treasured. You pass by several Ghouls, who sneer at the two highest-ranking beings in the city with distaste, but do nothing to stop you and Ragnor from going past them.\n\n\"The civilians especially will need to recognize you as some sort of lord before they can warm up to us. You just need to continue watching them and help them out every once in a while when they complain.\"\n\n\"Why don\u0027t we just give you a title?\"\n\n\"Because I don\u0027t want one.\"\n\nYour laugh is cut short when you reach the fence surrounding the City. From the distance, you can see what Simon was talking about, though the sun gets in the way of noticing specific features. Thankfully, you have a pretty thick hood to protect you from the ever-blazing sun-- you ran out of lotion not too long ago. There was some sort of helmet Cecilia gave you to wear, but you decided it was too intimidating to wear around town, even if it was comfortable and protected you from the sun.\n\n\"Ragnor, you see \u0027em?\"\n\n\"Vamp, do you recognize the man in sackcloth?\"\n\n\"I\u0027d have to move closer to get more details in, so I\u0027m afraid not.\"\n\n\"It\u0027s Gideon.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m certain of it. That glorious bastard must have convinced the Zealots to follow him. He probably taught them to fight during the year, too. This is going to be a much harder battle than we once thought if it gets that far.\"\n\n\"So what should we do? I warned the Wolves to get ready, thankfully, but how should we approach Gideon and his men?\"\n\n\"Well, we can gather everybody to fight head-on or try to approach Gideon and his men more carefully. I\u0027m not sure which way we should go, though. Do you think Gideon had a heart big enough to not try to trample us if only the two of us go out to meet him?\"\n",

You return the embrace, happiness overcoming the previous thoughts of dread.\n\n\"I\u0027m glad to see your alright, man. We had a tough fight, but we fended the hordes of Zealots off. How did your fights go?\"\n\nYou nod, \"We... We killed Tomas and- and a man named Karat, called himself \u0027Chief\u0027.  Either way, the place was deserted from Zealots by the time I came looking for you.\"\n\n\"Zealots? What about civilians?\"\n\nCecilia joins the interrogation with the question you least wish to answer at this moment, \"And where\u0027s David?\"\n\n\"The Father killed him.\" You answer succinctly, still trying to get your mind off of it-- you don\u0027t want anymore nightmares. \"I\u0027m going to deal with the civilians soon, Ragnor. I have a plan for them.\"\n\nRagnor nods in turn, \"Unfortunate, though he died a warrior\u0027s death. What shall you do with the civilians?\"\n\n\"Ghoul them, use them to help rebuild this city. Once this works, we can make an entire civilization of Zealots, and then... Find the Professor and kill the bastard.\"\n\n\"Solid thinking. But what precisely is the next move?\"\n\n\"Well, where are the surviving Creations?\"\n\n\"Rampaging. Cecilia here was the only one of the virgins to be able to control their forms.\"\n\n\"Rampaging?\"\n\n\"Err, yeah.\" Ragnor replies, confused, \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\n\n\"For the plan to work we need as many live humans as possible to rebuild. Ghouls, remember?\" Without wasting anymore time, you begin to move back in search of the Wolves when you feel a heavy hand on your shoulder, holding you back.\n\n\"Woah there, Vamp. Are you sure you want to stop them? This is the first time they\u0027re in actual control of their lives. Plus, they\u0027re probably too tired to do any real damage. Just let \u0027em have their fun, alright?\"\n",

You raise your hands up, using your off-hand to take off your black visor. \"I\u0027m a Creation, a Vampire.\"\n\nIt takes several more moments for one of them to respond.

I won\u0027t tell you what to do, kid, but I think the right answer is fairly obvious.\"\n\nYou take a last moment to examine the room-- bones (human by size) litter a corner and the youth suddenly stares back at you with open eyes, only to turn away to spit out a certain piece of bone. The rest just stare at you with hopeless eyes, as if the decision was already made. Some even seem to be readying to either charge you or run-- you\u0027re not sure. These people are savage...

After a small discussion about it with Ragnor, you decided that it may be best to have weekly group sessions where everybody can \u0027talk\u0027. It\u0027s silly and tacky but you go along with it. Morale is important.\n\nOne of the more memorable meetings was when you discussed the trauma induced from the Professor himself.\n\n\"He used to stick a needle in me!\" the young Allen blurts out, breaking the ice. \"He\u0027d continually poke and pull out my blood until there was nothing left...\"\n\nDarla scoffs, \"That\u0027s nothing, kiddo. The Professor-- he, he used to check if I could become...\"\n\nWe all watched her closely, intrigued by what she may say, until, suddenly, Doria begins to tear up and bury her head in her arms. Ragnor awkwardly puts his hand around her in an attempt to comfort her, but to no avail.\n\n\"The Professor... He was a character.\" Ragnor begins, \"I was brought to consciousness for several days, as he used to take me to spar-- no, fight to the death with his other mutants. Consistently the blonde bastard would take a mortally wounded Creation and perform more experiments on them, to check if he did it right. Still, there was something charismatic about the monster, charismatic; fatherly. Those who survived the fights were sent to far-off places to fight humans, and when we returned we\u0027d be treated like kings until he stuffed us back into tubes.\"\n\nNordim remains silent, but perks his head up. His head shakes, but he says nothing. Shamino starts to speak, only to be shut down by Cecilia, who tightly grips Nordim\u0027s hand.\n\n\"Speak, young one.\" She whispers. Nordim nods, then opens his mouth. Nothing comes out, but eventually sounds can be made out.\n\n\"Professor Kurschner was like.... Like what Ragnor s-said, fatherly. Like, like a f-father to me. And, and... He used to give me treats... If I only hurt someone-- someone for him. I...\" He stops, and proceeds to \u0027do the Darla\u0027 and buries his head.\n\nSeveral gulps later, you begin to realize your displacement in the conversation. Why exactly is it that you are some sort of amnesiac? Everybody else seemed to remember something of the lab, but you know very little about anything. Only thing you know about yourself is that you\u0027re the only vampire left and that you somehow led 15 people to lead a rebellion against hundreds, only to win. Quite the accomplishment.\n\n\nYou shake your head out of the otherwise uninteresting memory. If only Ragnor had a better memory then we could track the Professor down...\n\nOther notes you\u0027ve gathered on your \u0027apostles\u0027:\n\nRagnor, your second in command and easily the strongest fighter in Home. At least, in his beast-form. He couldn\u0027t care less for this garbage, but goes through it for the team.\n\nCecilia isn\u0027t bashful about expressing herself to you, though it\u0027s obvious she\u0027d rather do it in private rather than discuss it with everybody else. Still, she realizes the importance of this for the younger of the group, so that\u0027s good.\n\nShamino is large and dopey, but he\u0027s really enthusiastic, which is great since something as silly as this needs the support.\n\nSimon is probably around sixteen years old and has been expressing discontent up until now. He seems to have warmed up after a couple of sessions of whining.\n\nDarla is still heartbroken over your ghoul\u0027s death. It\u0027s odd, but you never noticed that she and David were close. Then again, it\u0027s only now that you\u0027ve really been acquainted with the Wolves. More personally, at least. Either way, she appears to be benefiting from the sessions.\n\nNordim remains passive throughout all the sessions. Seems to share a resentment of any sort of authority and shudders when the Professor is discussed.\n\nAllen is extremely young, adolescent. He appears to idolize you and Ragnor, which gives you an impetus not to disappoint.\n\nAs for you yourself, well, you try your best to act like a leader, though you\u0027ve come to get bored of the place. The workload builds up and you don\u0027t want to bother anybody with your troubles.\n\nSomehow, you get the feeling that the Demon is somewhere out there-- the Professor lives. While you can\u0027t be certain of this, you simply feel the likelihood of something big happening any day now. And so you wait, praying for the day where you can take revenge on him  for what he did to you:  manipulating you and your brethren to hurt others-- without even knowing it! He used us as vessels for his own crimes, then left us out in the desert to be hunted down by the Zealots. The bastard will pay for what he did to us...\n",

I assume that\u0027s what you two were talking about last night?\"\n\nYou nod, \"We discussed it thoroughly, and I think that going to the Father, if he\u0027s as benevolent as you say, can only end well.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s great,\" Zadok replies with a grin, \"Get ready to go-- we\u0027re going now.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Now.\"\n\nYou get up in silence, grabbing at whatever clothes you can find. \"Uh...\" You look around, unsure what you could really bring. \"Can I meet the Father with this hoodie?\"\n\n\"Keep your voice down!.. And yeah, I guess.\"\n\n\"Why?\" You whisper, getting up out of your chair and nodding to Zadok. And is the Father expecting us?\"\n\n\"Not... Exactly. But keep quiet because Alice definitely doesn\u0027t want you to go to the Father, whatever the reason. Best not to trouble the poor girl.\"\n\nOn that note, you leave for the outdoors, only to find the dull City looming over you in the pale moon-light, each house a grayer variation of the other; bland and gloomy. The only color comes from flashy neon-lights which unnecessarily labeled the various buildings, as well as serve as markers for the street. As you follow Zadok through several arrays of gray buildings, you pass several unoccupied stands with signs depicting fruit, the pink-neon lights flashing, \"MARKET\".\n\nYou continue, until you come across two parallel buildings- both the largest in the City. One has a giant neon Cross, flashing through the night on its face, separating two powerful metal doors; and the other with an upside-down blue Cross, the doors also stainless steel.\n\n\"That there is the Zealot Head Quarters,\" Zadok points out, noticing your confusion on the upside-down Cross. \"It shows how we have to sometimes twist the Holy Word if we are to preserve it. It\u0027s an unfortunate truth, but our Sword of God is just. Sometimes we have to kill-- even if it\u0027s forbidden, we need to defend ourselves. Get it?\"\n\nYou nod, realizing that that\u0027s how they must justify slaughtering Creations, like Kelso mentioned. I wonder what\u0027s up with that bastard... And now that I think about it, I wonder how much of what he said is true.\n\n\"And that\u0027s the Main Church, where Father Tomas and his monks live. That\u0027s where we\u0027ll be going.

Vampires in the tales of Fantasy are glamorized; nigh-immortal, sexually desirable, powerful. But, while you suppose you are some of those things, in truth, you are not much more than an albino with a lot of health issues. The sun, he said, will damage your skin more than anything else. Any sort of foodstuff can\u0027t be digested anymore by your barely functioning bodily systems. He claims to have an idea of what the \u0027Professor\u0027 was trying to do to us, but for whatever reason, he has dodged the questions anytime you ask.\n\nAny information other than that, Kelso hasn\u0027t revealed. The irking thing is that it is obvious he knows what\u0027s going on, but he consistently acts as if it is in your own good you don\u0027t know what went on.\n\nThe nights have been hard since your escape from the Facility. Most nights you wake up shivering, after all the nightmares you\u0027ve been dealing with. It\u0027s terrifying, and it only makes you wonder what horrible things were done to you at the Facility. You do know that they must have affected your ability to feel. No, not the wishy washy \u0027emotional\u0027 garbage you\u0027d usually expect, but your sense of touch was dulled. While a lot of your senses have been heightened, that one stands out. You feel very little pain from your feet, which is odd; considering how you spent your time running over cracked glass just two days ago, but it seems to have healed recently.\n\n---\n\nWaiting. It should be sunrise by now. Kelso said you shouldn\u0027t get out, as you are a creature of the darkness now. He, on the other hand, has been out for the entire night and then some. You\u0027re not sure what Kelso is hunting for, but you know that you\u0027re beginning to get thirsty. More and more questions begin to build up, and no doubt the bastard won\u0027t answer half of them. Even while you ran with him through the night, running across various landscapes. Most are just a barren dessert, though every once in while you\u0027d pass a half-buried house like this.\n\n\"Bright lights up ahead.\" He said. A city only several miles down. Kelso must have gone there for the clothes he mentioned, but you hope he\u0027s safe....\n",
  "page 284": "Zadok shrugs, \"It\u0027s not really something that everybody has to agree on, but the main concept of one God and a leader doing his best to follow his ways is probably the one thing keeping our City together. Us Zealots believe that almost all religions have a hint of truth to them, but the Holy Writings typically refer to the Old Testament, I think, but we don\u0027t follow that to the word either. The Cross, to us, symbolizes faith and love, but not for others, but to God himself. Jesus was a Dreamer, like the many prophets before-hand and afterwards. But a Dreamer isn\u0027t a prophet-- he\u0027s a sacrifice of his own volition, a vessel for God to inhabit and make an example of. Like the Nazirim in the olden day, they give their life strictly for God. That it why we still use the Cross, for it shows that all our actions are a way to closer our connection with Him. We\u0027re all the children of God, and all of us give our lives to God in a different way. A doctor here is supposed to give his life to God by healing others. I gave my life to God by using it to fight evil.\"\n\n\"And if they don\u0027t believe?\"\n\n\"If they live here then it\u0027s unlikely, but in theory if they openly dissuade people from believing then we\u0027re supposed to give them rations and send them off into the desert. It\u0027s not... Ideal, but they\u0027re supposed come back with a dream and believe again or they never return. That\u0027s what Father declared as a law years ago, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ever happened. I\u0027d like to say it\u0027s because our faith as a nation is so strong, but I think it\u0027s possibly due to fear.\" He shrugs, \"However, those who don\u0027t believe but aren\u0027t offensive about it aren\u0027t trusted by most either way and can\u0027t work, so Father Tomas meets with them to re-inspire their faith. Living in this waste-land is hard on morale, and the priest does what he can to make sure people can work with others and be happy, regardless.\"\n\n\"And this belief system is what Tomas believes?\" You ask, holding back most of your questions. How this place has been held together for 7 years is beyond me...\n\n\"Not really sure. That\u0027s my version, by the way, everybody probably believes differently. Some stricter, others not. The two things universal are that God is up there and that we don\u0027t mess with what he already made. That\u0027s what caused Annihilation, after all.\"\n\n \n",
  "page 162": "The Ghouls are, to put it simply, unhappy. From devout followers of God to what they believe are demons. If you weren\u0027t the leader of the City, you\u0027d perhaps find it amusing when a Ghoul would attempt at suicide, only to find themselves un-killable by normal means. It\u0027s a sick kind of amusement which you don\u0027t take part it, though you can certainly see the appeal.\n\nThey mostly live wherever they used to anyhow, only now they depend on your monthly visits when you give them vials of blood which the parents hide from their children. Almost every-time you appear an enraged male tries to fight you, but they\u0027re quite simply no match. It takes a while, but it\u0027s relaxed, for the most part.\n\nYou have more or less recognized that only time can repair the fences torn down. Perhaps one day they\u0027ll understand.\n\nWhat you do realize, however, is that you\u0027ll need lots of blood to maintain this, and as such you have to make monthly visits to the old Zealot-HQ, where the twenty humans left serve as \u0027blood-donors\u0027.\n\nYou stop off at the old Zealot-HQ, where the twenty-or-so remaining humans are still kept. You open the metal doors, where what used to be a cafeteria for Zealots now holds Ghouls, carefully placing vials of blood into specific containers, storing them in an unused cupboard. As you enter, the Ghouls rise at attention and salute, before scurrying out of the building. They know why you\u0027re here.\n\nOnce a month you have to extract more blood out of the humans, as well as make sure they\u0027re scared enough of you so they won\u0027t turn on each other. It\u0027s happened before, and you have to make sure it doesn\u0027t happen again-- after all, your society is defendant on feed.\n\nYou move forward and to the right, opening another door which leads to a hallway, which leads in to another door whom\u0027s staircase leads to the basement, where the humans are kept. You go down the steps, flipping a light-switch as you do so. The lights are dim and buzz a lot, but the Zealots installed a powerful generator can probably work for several more years.\n\nThe humans, shackled, pale, and grim, peer at you in the dim lighting. Their faces express nothing but disgust mixed with fear, and they say no words to you. You reach for a flask with one hand, and the other grasps the wrist of a young girl. She must have been ten before you took the City over, and now she is... Developed. Mature in physical, and probably would be attractive if she wasn\u0027t as pale as the undead themselves. You bend down and look at her straight in the eye as your claws rip into her wrist, and as blood pours out into the flask below she doesn\u0027t even cry out in pain-- none of them do, they just watch. When the flask is several centimeters full you patch her wrist with a large band-aid filled with alcohol. At this she winces when you place it on, her slender frame shivering. You stand back up, and stare at the others, watching you as you get ready to leave, placing a cork in the flask. You turn back around, finished with only one of your tasks concerning them.\n\n\"Where is your god?\" You question the humans.\n\nNone of them answer, they just stare blankly at you, soulless.\n\nYou point to one of them, one that has the soiled garb of a minister, \"Where is your god now, human? Where has he gone to protect you in your time of need? In case you didn\u0027t know, an entire year has passed since your holding, and behold nothing has succeeded in saving you. You are hopeless.\"\n\nThey maintain their silence.\n\n\"Your only possible hope is to become one of the fallen, one of the so-called \u0027Demons\u0027 you once told your children to fear. Today I give you that option, to live eternal unlife, not the death that awaits you.\"\n\nOne or two look up to you, some in fear, some in disgust, and some of interest.\n\n\"Those who wish to join me can. Stand up, throw away your principles, and you shall join the magnificent civilization that has been created in God\u0027s absence.\"\n\nThe girl you just cut speaks, \"If- if I join you... will, will my child be safe?\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, only to see one of the young men, close to her, holding her hand tightly. You notice a slight bulge in her stomach. You rub your chin, \"Aha...\" Perhaps that would be a better method to keep the City living. Use the thirty here to reproduce more children to feed off of... \"Yes, he would. You and your mate may stand, for we will take care of you.\"\n\nWith a weak smile, the girl trembles to get up, while the male solemnly helps her up.\n\n\"Indeed, I didn\u0027t expect for you to be able to... Be intimate here, but this is for the best. Whomever wishes to be fruitful, and to multiply, will be granted access to the World above. The rest will continue to stay here.\"\n\nSeveral more haggard men and women stand up, just barely able to with their shackles. With a powerful strike, you break the metal holding them, and the thirteen men and women stand behind you. The rest of them-- a truly hopeless pair of twins who still believe in their deity just wait there, watching as you take several of the men and ghoul them in front of the emotionally scarred group, the blood spraying over them. They stare blankly as you grab at the oldest human, and swipe at his neck-- revealing all of his ruby red blood before he could even react.\n\nThe boy of the pair stares at you angrily; and knowingly, that he couldn\u0027t possibly fight you. The other of the two-- an odd looking girl with a bizarre paper-hat on her head-- one shaped like some sort of boat-- doesn\u0027t even react, truly mortified by your actions.\n\nAs the youth glare at you, you deftly snatch the hat from her head, unfolding it slightly to read what the blotches of ink read. The brother breaks out of his phase just to push at you, trying to get the hat back only for you to easily push him back several meters with but a flick of your wrist. Just glancing at the paper, you recognize the format to realize that it is not recent-- pictures of gardens and open-houses primarily being the subject of the paper. Boring.\n\nYou drop the newspaper on the floor before motioning to your new workers to follow you. Soon enough, you place the mates into their own \u0027cells\u0027, houses under lock and key. Every several days you watch to see how things are, and whether their efforts to make children for you is working.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like it will take years before you can harvest the fruits of this brilliant plan, but at the very least it seems like a good investment...\n",
  "page 283": "Zadok almost instantly replies, \"God, obviously.\"\n\nYou hold back your laughter-- though you aren\u0027t sure why you find it amusing, \"No, I mean, how is it governed? Does Tomas, err, Father Tomas just lead everybody and you all listen?\"\n\nThe Zealot doesn\u0027t bother withholding his laughter, \"Of course not! The Father and his disciples deal with the matters of direction; what the people need to stock up on, morale, the like...\"\n\n\"Disciples?\"\n\n\"His disciples were voted in by the citizens-- basically just regular people known to be God-fearing and willing to give their life to studying mysticism and religion with the Father. They\u0027re more or less monks. Anyway, the religion-division works with the Zealot leaders-- Chief, myself, and Karat. Ranking in descending order. Father Tomas actually has more influence than us, since we mostly just keep the peace, collect taxes outlined in the Holy Writings, and hun-- but that\u0027s for a good reason. The Zealots fight for God while the Father leads people to serve God. Him and the disciples discuss laws that are introduced by his weekly sermons, and we make sure they are enforced. Thankfully, there is little crime around here. We realize that Gd is always watching, so even with a small police force that\u0027s usually already divided between tasks and even less ability to find criminals thanks to our limited tech, we get a lot of sharing of necessities between neighbors and practically no murder. The City as it is now is actually pretty young-- I mean, it\u0027s only been what, 7 years since Annihilation? But we get by...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, trying to process everything, \"Annihilation? Demons? What happened?\"\n\n\"Well, immorality and God\u0027s justice. We\u0027re simply paying for the after-affects of meddling with God\u0027s creations and allowing evil to poison our youth.\" Zadok stops facing you to look up at the moon, before adding, \"It was the equivalent of The Flood, but with Fire and brimstone, as prophesied in the Writings.\"\n\nOkay... \"How did the people here survive, then? And, uh, what are the demons left?\"\n\n\"People believing in the Rapture made bunkers way before it happened, saw some flares after the fallout and heard of the only City that missed the explosion. We used to get a lot of refugees, Father Tomas took a lot of us in. But we haven\u0027t had anybody new for years. Reason why you\u0027re such a mystery, eh?\" He ribs you in the side with a weak chuckle, \"But there\u0027s still demons-- the ones that helped bring about this Calamity, that are able to survive under these conditions. Bloodsuckers, shape-shifters, more. That\u0027s what Father Tomas calls them, and I\u0027ve killed the buggers up close. Vile, insane creatures that can plow through an entire battalion of Zealots. Most don\u0027t talk, and the ones that do plead innocence and sentience before they swallow your best friend whole. That\u0027s why hunt them-- unholy freaks of nature, see. They dig burrows in the dirt, trying to hide. But we\u0027re weeding out the ones in the area. In the seven years we\u0027ve been here, Father told us not to leave the premises, but now he\u0027s changed his policies, wants to find other living populations and such. Which is good, this place needed change.\"\n\nYou only nod before taking the conversation elsewhere.\n\n \n",
  "page 165": "With a weak smile you cautiously approach Cecilia. \"Alright, my love. Just remain quiet-- the others are still sleeping.\" You continue nearing the Wolf, who lowers her giant snout to clumsily lick your face. The slobber and sound gives you a distinct feeling of disgust, but you manage to nuzzle the liquid off your face on Cecilia\u0027s fur.\n\n\"Are you sure you want this?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\" Cecilia whispers, her snout forming some sort of smile.\n\nOn her command, you sink your teeth into her neck, getting your mouth full of hairs. It takes a while, but you finally manage to slurp enough blood that you feel the \u0027rush\u0027.  Power, energy, heat; everything connects you further in the moment. Despite her quirks, you\u0027ve come to appreciate her more than anybody else. After all, she sacrificed most of her ability to feel just so you could savor her blood... No, she said she wished to live for eternity, like myself. To be with me, forever...\n\nYou feel the sticky red goo splatter around your lips as the Wol struggles to not howl by pounding the ground around you. Your teeth maintain a strong hold on her neck, for you know that if you release prematurely the Ghouling process would have to be repeated from the beginning. The sweet and sour drink continues to flow down your throat, and before you know it--\n\nCecilia falls to the ground, naked and in her more human form. You fall upon her, and find yourself unconscious.\n\nYou wake back in your quarters, a pale Cecilia in your bed and hugging you tightly. If it were anybody else this might have been an opportunity for debauchery or something naughty, but no-- you\u0027re still asleep downstairs. But that doesn\u0027t matter.\n",
  "page 286": "\"Shall we go on, then?\"\n\n\"You bet.\" Zadok answers, pumping a fist. \"Tomas will be very pleased to meet you, good for you to find a place in our civilisation.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" you respond with a grin, \"he\u0027ll be able to give me purpose again.\"\n\nZadok looks at you questioningly before breaking into a laugh, \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s gonna try to baptize you or anything, but uh, hey, whatever works for you, man. I think you\u0027ll fit in fine hahaha.\"\n\nThe two of you, with Zadok in front, head up the grey concrete steps leading up to the Chapel. Your feet feel surprisingly cold as they thud against the rocky steps, as if repelling you from the neon-Cross ahead. Too far along, you trudge on with Zadok. The large stainless-steel doors daunt over you as you knock.\n\nYou bang three times on the metal surface, and await your judgment. The Zealot beside you pats you on the back, gleeful that you came with him. You wait several moments in silence until a bald, heavy-set man answers the door with a warm smile.\n\n\"Zadok! A bit early, I see. No matter-- the Father is finishing up anyway. And who\u0027s the friend beside you? I must confess, I haven\u0027t met personally with everybody here since I was Chosen, but I certainly have no recollection of this fellow...\"\n\n\"He\u0027s a newbie. That\u0027s part of the reason we\u0027re here-- didn\u0027t want to keep the man waiting. Courteousy, eh, Alon?\"\n\n\"Of course... Right then,\" the Monk mutters while eyeing you curiously, \"Well, come on in, quick! It\u0027s chilly outside!\"\n\nYou hadn\u0027t even noticed.\n\nThe two of you continue on, thanking the monk and entering the complex. Inside, a gathering of 10 chanting monks stop the waving of their arms to face you, each with the same curious look. \"Who is this, Brother?\"\n\n\"I already went over this. Alon can go tell you guys. Now, where\u0027s the Priest?\"\n\n\"We are not at liberty to state.\" The 10 chant in sync.\n\n\"Great,\" Zadok nods, \"We\u0027ll wait in his office, then. Thanks all!\"\n\nYou follow Zadok into a musty velvet room, bookshelves lining the walls, each packed with books in more languages than you can count. One pretty obvious one is facing toward you, labeled, \"Nosferatu: Satan\u0027s Knights\" and something else along those lines. You un-suspiciously lean in towards it slightly to make more of those particular set of books out, only to find demon banishing rituals and th like. With a sigh, you take a metal seat beside Zadok, in front of a rotting desk, waiting for Father Tomas.\n\n\"Do you know what he\u0027s doing?\" You ask, trying to pass the time.\n\n\"Hah, yeah I do. But it isn\u0027t the most holy of rooms, I\u0027d say. It\u0027s best not to say, though you can probably make it out.\"\n\n\"A... Bathroom?\"\n\nZadok nods. Several moments pass before he speaks up again. \"Oof, hey, man, I forgot to get the, uh... The armor you found...\" As his eyes dart around, you know where he\u0027s going with this.\n\n\"You need to go get it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it\u0027s important the Priest gets it soon. You mind if I make a dash for it?\"\n\n\"And leave me alone with the Father?\"\n\n\"Well, uh, yeah. Unless you really want me to be there with ya. Kinda weird, but I get it. New guy, gets a bit nervous. Right?\"\n",
  "page 164": "Even though the Creations are now in control of their lives and aren\u0027t persecuted for existing, you\u0027ve heard several reports from the younger ones about nightmares and need for emotional support. After a small discussion about it with Ragnor, you decided that it may be best to have weekly group sessions where everybody can \u0027talk\u0027. It\u0027s silly and tacky but you go along with it. Morale is important.\n\nOne of the more memorable meetings was when you discussed the trauma induced from the Professor himself.\n\n\"He used to stick a needle in me!\" the young Allen blurts out, breaking the ice. \"He\u0027d continually poke and pull out my blood until there was nothing left...\"\n\nDarla scoffs, \"That\u0027s nothing, kiddo. The Professor-- he, he used to check if I could become...\"\n\nWe all watched her closely, intrigued by what she may say, until, suddenly, Doria begins to tear up and bury her head in her arms. Ragnor awkwardly puts his hand around her in an attempt to comfort her, but to no avail.\n\n\"The Professor... He was a character.\" Ragnor begins, \"I was brought to consciousness for several days, as he used to take me to spar-- no, fight to the death with his other mutants. Consistently the blonde bastard would take a mortally wounded Creation and perform more experiments on them, to check if he did it right. Still, there was something charismatic about the monster, charismatic; fatherly. Those who survived the fights were sent to far-off places to fight humans, and when we returned we\u0027d be treated like kings until he stuffed us back into tubes.\"\n\nNordim remains silent, but perks his head up. His head shakes, but he says nothing. Shamino starts to speak, only to be shut down by Cecilia, who tightly grips Nordim\u0027s hand.\n\n\"Speak, young one.\" She whispers. Nordim nods, then opens his mouth. Nothing comes out, but eventually sounds can be made out.\n\n\"Professor Kurschner was like.... Like what Ragnor s-said, fatherly. Like, like a f-father to me. And, and... He used to give me treats... If I only hurt someone-- someone for him. I...\" He stops, and proceeds to \u0027do the Darla\u0027 and buries his head.\n\nSeveral gulps later, you begin to realize your displacement in the conversation. Why exactly is it that you are some sort of amnesiac? Everybody else seemed to remember something of the lab, but you know very little about anything. Only thing you know about yourself is that you\u0027re the only vampire left and that you somehow led 15 people to lead a rebellion against hundreds, only to win. Quite the accomplishment.\n\n\nYou shake your head out of the otherwise uninteresting memory. If only Ragnor had a better memory then we could track the Professor down...\n\nOther notes you\u0027ve gathered on your \u0027apostles\u0027:\n\nRagnor, your second in command and easily the strongest fighter in Home. At least, in his beast-form. He couldn\u0027t care less for this garbage, but goes through it for the team.\n\nCecilia isn\u0027t bashful about expressing herself to you, though it\u0027s obvious she\u0027d rather do it in private rather than discuss it with everybody else. Still, she realizes the importance of this for the younger of the group, so that\u0027s good.\n\nShamino is large and dopey, but he\u0027s really enthusiastic, which is great since something as silly as this needs the support.\n\nSimon is probably around sixteen years old and has been expressing discontent up until now. He seems to have warmed up after a couple of sessions of whining.\n\nDarla is still heartbroken over your ghoul\u0027s death. It\u0027s odd, but you never noticed that she and David were close. Then again, it\u0027s only now that you\u0027ve really been acquainted with the Wolves. More personally, at least. Either way, she appears to be benefiting from the sessions.\n\nNordim remains passive throughout all the sessions. Seems to share a resentment of any sort of authority and shudders when the Professor is discussed.\n\nAllen is extremely young, adolescent. He appears to idolize you and Ragnor, which gives you an impetus not to disappoint.\n\nAs for you yourself, well, you try your best to act like a leader, though you\u0027ve come to get bored of the place. The workload builds up and you don\u0027t want to bother anybody with your troubles.\n\nSomehow, you get the feeling that the Demon is somewhere out there-- the Professor lives. While you can\u0027t be certain of this, you simply feel the likelihood of something big happening any day now. And so you wait, praying for the day where you can take revenge on him  for what he did to you:  manipulating you and your brethren to hurt others-- without even knowing it! He used us as vessels for his own crimes, then left us out in the desert to be hunted down by the Zealots. The bastard will pay for what he did to us...\n",
  "page 285": "Zadok stops to scratch at his stubble at his stubble before answering. \"Funny you should ask. There really seem to be some sort of history between you two which I don\u0027t know of, but Alice is like a sister to me since Annihilation. We found her in one of Kurschner\u0027s Facilities, apparently she interned at the place before that asshole went crazy. Well, crazier. It was one of the Zealots\u0027 first raids, about two weeks before God\u0027s fires ravaged the Earth. She was flustered and confused, and so I, young as I was, convinced Father Tomas to let her in. By then the City was a barricaded City which attracted the religious, and all over the country people came, but the Father liked to inspect the people that came. So I vouched for her, out of sympathy because I don\u0027t think she\u0027 have passed.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Weren\u0027t-chalistenin\u0027?\" He asks, raising an eyebrow, \"She worked side-by-side with Kurschner, Creator of Demons. Damn so-called scientist helped destroy the world with his \u0027solution\u0027.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" So, that\u0027s how she must have known about me...\n\n\"Man, I keep forgetting just how clueless you are,\" he says grimly, \"Simon Kurschner was the man who the progressive government funded to mess with God\u0027s creations, humans. He tried to make humans, \u0027better\u0027, immortal and impervious to disease. The nonbeliever created the demons, see, and Alice, while obviously not in his leagues, was obviously not a good fit with the rest of the Citizens. To this day I\u0027m not sure if she really believes, but thank God things worked out for the best. Father keeps a close watch on her and she was a great addition to the community. Now she lives with me because I guess... I dunno, she was living in a crappy office in the library and she honestly does make the days more bearable. I like my Zealot-buddies but, you know, you need some interaction that is more eh... Permanent. After my promotion Father Tomas gave me that large house since he thinks I\u0027m gonna marry Alice or something, but that\u0027s not it. She\u0027s just nice to have around.\"\n\n\"I guess I understand,\" you reply, \"so you\u0027re just friends with her, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that\u0027s right, you can make your move.\" He guffaws, giving you a pat on the back and laughing once again.\n\nZadok is one odd guy... \"Uh, that\u0027s not what I was getting at, actually.\"\n\n\"Right.\" He answers with a sly grin. \"But don\u0027t worry, after we talk to the Father I think you\u0027ll have plenty of access to having a family. New blood is only a good thing for the town, I say.\"\n\n\"What about you then?\" You laugh back.\n\n\"Maybe when we\u0027re done with the Wolves next door. Then we\u0027ll be safe and maybe I can do something then, but not now.\"\n\n\"Who\u0027re they?\"\n\n\"I think you\u0027ll find out soon enough.\"\n",
  "page 189": "\"Yes, master.\" You comply, giving him a short, though enunciated bow. The Professor beams at you.\n\n\"Excellent! We shall be going at once.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Everywhere. Bring your Ghouls, your loved one-- everything you own. For together, we will rule the Earth and create life anew!\"\n\n\nYou\u0027ll admit, that at the time he noted that you you didn\u0027t expect much from it. A lofty, exaggerated goal was what is seemed to be. And yet, here you are.\n\nThe world changed dramatically since that day. You found yourself at Kurschner\u0027s side, serving under him and doing his dirty work for him. You don\u0027t mind, however-- this is the man who gave you life. It is only fit that you pay back his kindness, with interest.\n\nThe first several days included a campaign to the South. On the way, you encountered the nomads-- those which you were searching for before the Professor picked you up. They fought valiantly, but your own Ghouls overcame them by sheer number. You noticed that the Ghouls enjoyed this, too. By now, they were converted to the same hate that you were brought up on.\n\nYou continued down the 40 miles, where you saw the fallen city. Buildings reduced to mere rubble, with no traces of humanity left. You continued several miles on, everyone in the party excited by the desolate city, where the pale corpses which were strewn about were devoured by the hungry citizens of Church-City.\n\nMiles ahead, you found more camps of humans, all of them toiling about, working. On the Professor command, you ghouled each and every last one of them, your army growing substantially. The screams of the children mean nothing to you, and the foolish men who try to oppose you are only a more satisfying feed. And this continued for year, until you really did conquer the continent. From there your army was large enough to split and conquered from the East to the West, South to North and throughout the entire visible landscape. Your surroundings changed, you found greenery and you found life, but they were all yours to conquer and overtake. Some of your army die, like your closest colleagues end up, but you delude yourself by saying to your blind followers, \"They died a warrior\u0027s death. Carry on.\"\n\nIt doesn\u0027t matter that even a fool such as you can see through the vanity of your own words, you have just come to not care. Your army of barbarians mean the end of mankind, and you recognize, after a while, that there isn\u0027t anything more to do.\n\nEven after the Professor\u0027s death, you remain just a servant to his ideals and goals. In fact, you barely notice his absence; his voice still whispering in your ear to this day. You\u0027re his ghoul for eternity, and that has become your persona. That is what you accomplished in your unlife. You rule the Earth, but you\u0027re not the ruler of yourself. You find yourself lost in the sea of madness, and, with every living source finally depleted, get the honor of witnessing your barbaric tribes turn on each other for feed. As the End of Days nears, and you recognize that Simon Kurschner, Kelso, had his wish fulfilled. The world will be forced to evolve on its own again, without humans or monsters to ruin it. A fresh start, without prejudice and without strife, all natural.\n\n\nAnd for your heroic actions, you were rewarded with marching across the desert alone, for an an eternity; until God himself had to come to take you away.\n",
  "page 188": "\"No.\" You state, getting out of your chair.\n\n\"No?\" Kelso repeats, raising an eyebrow. \"What do you mean, \u0027no\u0027?\"\n\n\"It means I\u0027m sick of being your puppet, you megalomaniacal bastard!\" You yell, sending an angry fist at the old man\u0027s face. The punch connects-- sending him back into a nearby bookcase.\n\nAnd yet, all he does is continue to laugh. \"Good good... I suppose I succeeded too well in making you think for yourself.\"\n\n\"I am NOT your Creation, I am my own. I developed these past to years without you, you have nothing on me, Kurschner.\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t kid yourself, you\u0027d be nothing without me!\" the Professor cackles. He holds out his forearm, which slowly begins to grow, making his sleeve begin to rip. Next comes his body... And his entire figure begins to change.\n\nBut you don\u0027t pay attention to it, and continue sending a flurry of punches and swipes at his midsection, ripping at his lab-coat. He bleeds pus, similar to you, only he seems to be a mixture of all of his Creations. After sending a powerful kick to create distance between the two of you, you suddenly marvel at the bloodied Creation.\n\nHair and bulky like a Wolf, with a regenerative system similar to yours, and something... Different. Different parts of his body are of different sizes, as if he can manipulate his body parts on a whim.\n\nThe Professor gets back on his feet, all your attacks healing by themselves. He spits out a tooth, then grins as he charges for you, his right arm shaped like a large, fleshy needle and the other like a bludgeoning tool. Kelso swings wildly, though swiftly and silently enough that it\u0027s hard to dodge.You send a powerful slash at his leg, though he deflects it with an enlarged kneecap, surviving as a shield of flesh. Soon enough, one of his strikes pierce into your stomach, keeping you still long enough for his hammer-arm to smash into your face.\n\nThe hit spins your head to the side, and the attacks don\u0027t stop there. He continues, on and on and on. Until finally you manage to throw him off of you once again. Your wounds aren\u0027t pretty, but you can already feel some of them healing, others taking a while longer.\n\n\"You cannot defeat me, I know everything you know, as I taught it to you!\" Kelso cackles, once again getting up. \"You and I are the same, Vamp. Both of us were brought up on anger, to be alienated from our actual families and never quite fitting in with the rest. Don\u0027t think you can defeat me, boy, this is where it ends for you.\"\n\nHe raises his fists to start another round.\n",
  "page 192": "\"Kelso, you taught me pretty much everything I know.\" You seethe, breathing heavily.\n\nThe Professor crackles once more, \"So, you get it now--\"\n\n\"But,\" you continue, cutting him off, \"There are things you didn\u0027t. Feelings that I witnessed that have much more meaning than vain anger.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"As tacky as it sounds, Professor, the answer is love.\"\n\nKelso\u0027s once sneering face turns to disgust. He spits at you before sending a brick-fisted haymaker at your head-- you dodge it with a simple crouch. Quickly, you sweep his legs from under him with a fluid movement of your right foot. He trips; catches himself; and then gets his neck bloodily slashed open by a long-reaching swipe with your claws, by now blood-streaked with his blood.\n\n\"Your mistake, Kelso, was to let me be with the Wolves. They were literally my own people-- people in a similar situation who were persecuted just for being who they were. Sure, they made mistakes... But they were good people who deserved to live.\"\n\n\"I thought you\u0027d understand!\" He shrieks, clutching his bleeding neck. He kicks in your direction, but it\u0027s collision doesn\u0027t phase you.\n\n\"There\u0027s nothing to \u0027understand\u0027, Kelso. We aren\u0027t the same, I HAD a family. The Wolves gave me reason. I was one of them. Perhaps I was their Lord and Savior, and maybe I wasn\u0027t regarded as a friend, but they accepted me, and I found love there, Kelso. I grew to--\" you send a flurry of slashes to his abdomen, \"enjoy my time with them. But then... You made me do your God damned dirty work and split them apart! It\u0027s your fault Gideon and Ragnor are dead!\"\n\nYour mentor shrieks in further pain, and through his struggling manages to knock you back with a swipe of his heavy hand. You\u0027re knocked back into your desk, splintering it in the collision. Kelso leaps onto you, taking advantage of your situation and grabbing you close, repeatedly head-butting you with a blocky forehead. Now with the initiative, he stops to throw you over his back and onto the ground. The harsh wood below you cracks as well, and he holds you with a painful arm lock.\n\n\"You utterly stupid kid! I thought you\u0027d understand what is at stake!\" He yells, beating on you with his elbow, \"You\u0027re another failure, like the rest of them! You were going to be different! But no... You got fucking soft, that\u0027s what happened. Too soft to realize this world isn\u0027t good enough to continue as is.\"\n\nBy now you can feel your cheek bone breaking repeatedly, only to realign and then break again. Pain...\n\n\"You.\" Another hit. \"Probably.\" Agh... \"Have been wondering why I chose you, huh? I\u0027ll tell you why. It\u0027s nothing fucking special. You\u0027re a nobody! You always--\"\n\n\"Gettofff!\" You gasp, feeling your shoulder dislocate. You struggle, but his hold on you is too strong...\n\n\"That\u0027s right. Nothing. You\u0027re an amnesiac, you forgot everything, and you just happened to be a successful specimen who would live for a looooong time. You were perfectly average, perfectly normal... A perfect guinea pig to continue my life\u0027s work. But you FAILED!\"\n\nKelso breathes out, taking deep breaths as he continues to grapple you. Ironically, it\u0027s his anger which allows you to get the upper end-- and as he breathes in... Out--- you summon all your anger- no, love and reminiscence for all of your friends. David, Gideon, Ragnor, Nordim... Cecilia.\n\n\"You won\u0027t lay one finger on my family, Kelso. This is the last time you do anything, you bastard!\" Yelling, you manage to thrust your pelvis upwards, throwing him very slightly into the air-- just enough for you to get on your feet.\n\nNow, with you in control, you grab him by his bleeding collar and slam him into the wall. Again and again, then onto the splintered floor again. He quickly gets up again, and attempts to grapple you once more. You wrestle through your study and across the meeting-hall, and close to the front door. He shoves you outdoors, where you both find yourself fighting during a heavy thunderstorm.\n\nYou send another slash to his neck, hoping to finish the bastard once and for all-- when he dodges, only to fall down the concrete steps. As he gets up, you leap the entire steps in one bound in order to shove him backwards.\n\nThe Professor his falls to the floor again, grazing his face onto the harsh concrete-- tumble and slam into the other end of a metal beam, hanging out of an abandoned building. The pipe penetrates through his back, keeping him there until you walk across the street to him.\n\nKelso stares at you with blank eyes, his life-force diminishing by the second, \"Is this-- is this how you will repay the man who made you who you are? Your Creator? Your Savior? Will you simply kill me to settle your petty vengeance?\n\n\"You just don\u0027t get it, Vampire. You see...\" He gives a weak, bland chuckle, \"If you kill me now, I win-- for it will lead you to continue my path of hatred throughout the rest of your pathetic existence. But, if you let me live... I also could win... No... Why don\u0027t you have your vengeance? Just kill me now, hahahaha!\"\n",
  "page 191": "You focus on everything that has happened to you-- the loss of memory, the death of David, Ragnor, Gideon, the rest of the Wolves and countless others-- all due to one man\u0027s master-plan for world domination. It\u0027s tacky, but it\u0027s evil, and I fell for this...\n\nWith a powerful leap, you fling your claws at his face, slashing at his cheek and pinning him to a wall. You apply pressure, and attempt to dig your fingernails into his forearms, bleeding him out while he is restrained.\n\nIt seems to work, at first. He attempts to headbutt you, but you simply do it back to hit, his head recoiling into a hardcover book behind him. Seizing the opportunity, you attempt to bite at his neck-- but he suddenly throws you off of him with hidden strength. You fly back, hitting your head on the carpeted floor. The Professor leaps on top of you, and begins to repeatedly slash into your chest with his needle-arm. Your vision begins to blur...\n\n\"Don\u0027t you get it? You can\u0027t beat me. I have more rage built up inside of me than you can stomach, fool!\" Kelso chuckles once again, before successfully grabbing at your head, and smashing it into his off-hand. You feel something warm entering your skull when--\n\n\nYou have been killed by The Professor.\n",
  "page 194": "With your fingers deeply entrenched into his neck, it takes a little more than a pull to finally killing him.\n\nAnd then it\u0027s over. All of it. The Professor is dead.\n\nOr so you think.\n\nThe week after, when every thing was explained and settled with your people, you and Cecilia began to reform your policies. Kelso admitted that there were several surviving strongholds somewhere in the desert. And now, with the Professor dead, you have no other priorities stopping you and your nation from conquering this Earth. It doesn\u0027t take long for you to mobilize your armies to search out and destroy any and all colonies they find, coming back and reporting to you immediately after.\n\nOne time, a sizeable group-- eighteen ghouls, don\u0027t return from a two hundred mile journey from home, though in actuality only a seventy-two mile trip due to the colonization of a a large row of identical rotting buildings. Neither does the next, smaller group you send after them.\n\nEventually, you decide that it is worth your attention enough to seek out yourself. With Cecilia by your side and ten Ghouls, you leave Home and begin a tedious trek through the desert to find the specific route the Ghouls disappeared at. The desert, crawling with various lizards and a single cactus, slowly reveals the effect of your colonizing. It isn\u0027t too amazing, but it seems that the sand is reacting to the unlife now living above it. You stop at one of the rotting houses, where the ghouls-- whom you don\u0027t really remember ghouling very well, treat you like a king. You stock up on desert-lizard blood, which tastes bland but at the very least gives you enough nutrition for a week per vial.\n\nYou leave contented, while the immigrants bow to your leave, crying out, \"Hail Lord of the Undead, Ruler of the Earth!\"\n\nYou and your team continue walking through the hot-desert, thanking the deities that your hood and mask have made it more bearable to do so by day. Ten miles, fifteen, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty-eight, seventy-two...\n\nSuddenly, you sense something odd. A smell... Something burnt, and it\u0027s coming your way--\n\nYou instinctively duck, and a large shell flies above you and into a Ghoul, exploding only after it slams into him. The explosion is fierce, and you find everybody but Cecilia, in wolf-form, on the ground to recover. Your vision clears up, and you find an approaching figure, cloaked with camo-patterned garbs and holding a large green pipe, pointing it in your direction.\n\n\"We were waiting for you to come. Vampire.\" The figure states, taking off his mask with his off-hand. You don\u0027t recognize the man, and you can\u0027t seem to place a finger on where his ancestry is from.\n\n\"Who are you?\" You yell back, readying your claws to fight.\n\n\"The Last of the Zealots. You\u0027re not getting away with your barbarism, demon. I\u0027m glad you came, though, because this is how we wanted to declare our war on you.\"\n\n\"Where did you come from?\"\n\n\"We\u0027ve been rebuilding for years now, since Father Tomas sent us out in the case of emergency. And, well, when rumors of the \u0027Fearsome Vampire Lord\u0027 spread through this desert, we realized this was fate that God planned out. You... You killed our parents, and now we have the chance to kill you!\"\n\n\"Fool!\" You seethe, running past Cecilia as the Zealot loads his weapon again to shoot, \"The Ghouls are much more numerous and much more powerful than you humans, you stand no chance!\"\n\nHe laughs before shooting his bazooka again at you-- he misses once again, only hurting more of your ghouls. A moment later, his vocal chords are slashed out in a blood squirt, you happily savoring the blood.\n\n\"Vamp, there\u0027s... There\u0027s two hundred Zealots coming this way!\" Cecilia shouts from behind you pointing at maybe half of that, fully armed Zealots less than a mile down. Once they notice us...\n\nYou turn back, surveying the situation-- All but one Ghoul is badly injured, their limbs maimed to the point of crippling. What can we do?\n\n\"You, healthy one, get up, run, and save yourself! Warn the rest of the Ghouls to prepare for battle, and stay low until you\u0027re out of their range.\"\n\nHe nods and leaves, running in the direction you came from. \"Vamp... What are we doing then?\" Cecilia asks, fear in her large canine eyes.\n\n\"We... We can\u0027t just leave our Ghouls her to die. Maybe... Ugh, God... Cecilia, can you dig?\"\n\nShe nods, understanding-- if she can make a burrow that can fit you all, you can at least survive until they pass. As it is now, they can overtake you with the distance of their weapons if they notice you running away now. Cecilia begins to dig, using her powerful claws to sift through the dirt. Minutes pass, and you look behind your shoulder...\n\nThey see you. You\u0027re in range.\n\nYou wake up in a dark chasm, feeling little, if any pain. \"Ce-Cecilia?\" You call out into the darkness.\n\n\"I\u0027m here, love.\"\n\n\"What... Happened?\"\n\n\"We were hit.\"\n\n\"Hit?\"\n\n\"You, especially. It\u0027ll take time to heal.\"\n\nWith great effort, you bring your head up. Your body seems to be stuck in the sand. Why... You struggle, angrily waving your arms around. Sand pours onto your face, and with a solid yank, you pull out a stubby  forearm. No hand.\n\n\"Ahh!\"\n\n\"Relax, dear. It will... heal. In time.\" She brings her face in front of yours and frowns. \"I don\u0027t know if you remember, but...\"\n\n\"But what? How did this happen?\"\n\n\"The shell struck you directly. Thank God for your armor, but... It took away several of your appendages. I couldn\u0027t fit all the Ghouls in the hole I made, so I fit you in there right before they came to finish off the job. We\u0027ve been hiding here since.\"\n\n\"How long has it been?\"\n\n\"I\u0027ve counted a month, Vamp. It\u0027s taken a while, but your limbs are restoring themselves.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath. \"Do you know what became of the war?\"\n\n\"The Ghouls and the remaining Humans slaughtered each-other mercilessly until nothing was left. Every we\u0027ve worked for, it\u0027s gone.\"\n\n\"Show me the outside.\"\n\n\"Nothing is left, I told you.\"\n\n\"Show me the outside, Cecilia. Please.\"\n\nSlowly, she complies. With delicate handiwork, she carves out your other stub, and one of your bloody thighs, missing the leg. She carries your corpse to a wall of sand, pokes a hole in it and puts your eye to it. \"See? We can\u0027t even see an outline of the City from here.\"\n\n\"Open it up a little more, love.\"\n\nShe does so, opening up the door and allowing light to completely dominate the chasm.\n\nYou view the desolate terrain with a weak smile, \"So, this is what\u0027s left?\"\n\n\"Yeah. The Ghouls wouldn\u0027t survive after such a heavy onslaught from the Last Zealots, and as such they took everything they had to kill the Zealots. Both sides succeeded.\"\n\n\"You think there are any humans left that know of us?\"\n\nCecilia smiles, though only half of her face has enough skin to show it, \"Definitely. I\u0027d be surprised if the tale of the Assault on Church-City isn\u0027t a horror story for children on the other side of this desert-planet.\" She puts you down, and you situate yourself to sit in front of the view. \"Crazy, isn\u0027t it?\"\n\n\"That what?\"\n\n\"That the sun is so big today. It\u0027s been growing.\"\n\n\"Vampy... Are you feeling alright?\"\n\n\"See... I killed all those who wronged me, in the end. Then it turned out that even my beloved mentor wronged me, and now there is nobody in the end, haha.\"\n\n\"There\u0027s you and me left.\" She states, sitting down next to you. Even with have of her body charred, she still brightens your day further.\n\n\"You know, it really is beautiful. The desert.\"\n\n\"You\u0027re right.\"\n",
  "page 196": "\"No, this is where you don\u0027t win. I know you want me to kill you, to finish my contract with you. To become a killer and to not have a path to return to. But no... If there\u0027s one thing I learnt from my experience in this realm, it\u0027s that somewhere beneath all the hatred you bred into me, there lies somebody who can care about others. It\u0027s crazy and it sounds funny, but it\u0027s true. There\u0027s good beneath the worst people, and even if redemption isn\u0027t a possibility for you, that doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t for me, Kelso. I screwed up. Even if it was influenced by you, it doesn\u0027t change that I made the choice to overtake the City. My screw-up, and countless of people were killed due to me...\"\n\n\"And yet,\" you continue, \"my life isn\u0027t over. As you said, I will be living for a long while longer, and perhaps I\u0027ll be able to rebuild humanity. Not by destroying it, like you want me to, but by helping others, making it a point that revenge isn\u0027t the way to settle a score. What you did to me wasn\u0027t a blessing, it was a horrible curse that I will have to endure for eternity. But, deep inside of me I realize that I wanted to do good, little bits of me recognized right from wrong in my journey here. I cared about someone, my gut instincts were benevolent and yet I went against them. I was corrupted, and I... I have to purify myself. And that I shall, Kelso, that I shall.\"\n\nAfter a pause, you release Kelso from your grip. He falls down to the floor, gaping at you in shock. You smile back weakly, and lend out your hand to him.\n\n---\n\nThey say that our purpose on this earth is to learn from our mistakes so that we can help the world become a better place. Others say we have no purpose at all, and all is null and void at the end.\n\nBut you made your own destiny. A tradition of kindness spreads through the earth as your army of Ghouls begin to discover hidden societies forming hundreds of miles away. Across the never-ending desert, humanity soon picks itself up from the ground.\n\nIndeed, you are known throughout the world as the Vampire Lord, though feared as a creature of extraordinary influence and power, are also known to be the harbinger of peace between the tribal humans that poked their heads out of their holes, to create new civilizations.\n\nYou outlast all of your peers, even Cecilia, and witness the Earth\u0027s rebirth. However, even throughout the storm that is time, you never find yourself alone. Your fallen comrades remain in your soul, urging you to continue living and loving, giving hope to those who don\u0027t deserve it and single-handedly punishing  those who start their petty wars in the dirt.\n\nEffectively, you have become a God on Earth. Indeed, this is what became of your identity: a humane and benevolent persona with which you hold onto for eternity.\n\nAnd yet, when the fateful day came and Apollo arrived for your soul-- you don\u0027t even struggle. Your ending is of bliss.\n",
  "page 195": "This time, you laugh back at him. \"Don\u0027t think you\u0027ll get off that easy, Kelso. You and I... We\u0027ll have a lot more in common very soon.\"\n\nThe half-blinded freak of nature stares at you blankly as you release your grip around its throat. It falls on its knees, pitifully looking up at you in confusion.\n\n\"No,\" you state, as if to answer a question, \"I\u0027m not killing you. But I\u0027m not letting you live either.\"\n\nKelso\u0027s eyes widen as he begins to struggle once more, but your hand reaffirm a hold on him, and you sink your teeth into his jugular, and slowly begin to drain the bastard of his life-source. The blood is absolutely horrid, tasting like vinegar in comparison to the good wine of regular blood, but the crimson juice tastes satisfying nonetheless. This is the first time a scream of pain has given you a feeling of such grandeur.\n\n\nFrom that day on Simon Kurschner became your right-hand Ghoul, as many much greater men had served before him. As a slave, he unwittingly works off the unlimited hours that are the worth of the people he caused you to harm, the countless lives he affected negatively. It marks something very important about your reign back Home as well; you are vicious, cunning, and efficient.\n\nYour Ghoul army, now with influence spanning the entire sandy globe, started out small, but soon began growing and conquering nearby regions. Human survivors hundreds of miles away came to try to stop the advancement of your forces, only to find themselves outnumbered and outmatched. Eventually they tried to set up peace-terms, but, seeing how you have no reason to comply, simply continued to wage wars with them, enslaving the survivors to help your civilization grow.\n\nHowever, as time passes, you find your heavily interconnected race of sentient gods-on-Earth begin to fight and form their own factions under your nose. They begin warring with each other as children might, over the small things like territory and generation-- because apparently the amount of time elapsed since they were ghouled is an important landmark.\n\nYou\u0027ve come to disregard it, for it all seems like nonsense. Regardless of what the ridiculous things they squabble over, for they all report back to you. \u0027Vampire Lord\u0027 is what the majority of the world has come to title you, and it has come to grow on you. You are the Ruler of the One Continent, the single, immense desert that has dominated the wasteland, and you are the king of it all.\n\nUnexpectedly, perhaps, perhaps half a century later, where you and your wife spend your days in the palace built in your honor, you find a large faction of Ghouls who have decided you are unfit to be the Overlord. 1st generation Ghouls, the most troublesome lot, have led the charge. The name of their leader is something... with a Z. You simply cannot recall.\n\nThe revolt was put down in one night.\n\nCountless years go by, where you find yourself alone and impoverished, for your Ghouls ran rampant within dependence and found ways to kill themselves off. Your wife\u0027s brittle hands attempt to hold you down, telling you not to engage the final monster, the last being still alive on this plane. \"But no, my love, my time is for nothing if I don\u0027t challenge Him. If I am ruler of this Earth, what have I to fear?\"\n\n\nYou assure your wife of your survival, and embrace the One outside. The planet surrounding you has become a crystalline wonderland in man\u0027s absence, beautifully empty and smooth. No matter how hard you fight, you find yourself taking your seat among the stars, just like everybody else.\n",
  "page 198": "Switching back to the route to the lost City, as implicated from the files you read from what seems like a long time ago, you soon find yourself in the heat of day, the sun beating down on your hoodie and Nordim serving as your eyes in the heavy daylight.\n\nAs such, you make relatively little progress during the day, and it really dawns on the night to make sure you actually reach your destination quickly. Day and night you travel,\n\nThe City is magnificent, huge-- exotic, with ornate designs on the debris of buildings that you simply won\u0027t find in your City. Perhaps that is why this place fell and the City you have is still running-- metal and concrete will simply last longer than brick. That, or something foreign completely devastated the area. Perhaps both contributed.\n\nThe streets, with silver beams serving to define the sidewalks and golden emblems on the doors of every collapsed building, have cracked considerably, making it difficult terrain to walk on. Instead, you find yourself leaping from a certain oversized concrete boulder to the next, if only because stepping into uneven stone spikes isn\u0027t exactly appealing.\n\n\"Vamp, what exactly are we looking for?\" Nordim asks, jumping behind you.\n\n\"Activity!\" You yell back, furiously turning your head around in several directions, in search of any sort of movement. \"Stay careful, Nordim. We don\u0027t know what lurks around here.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m not sure, my Lord. This place seems kind of abandoned.\"\n\nIgnoring him, you continue peeking into the buildings. Occasionally, you\u0027ll fine skeletal corpses devoid of flesh and blood, as if they were skinned alive and picked clean. Nordim doesn\u0027t say anything about it, but he seems grossed out.\n\n\"Vamp!\" He suddenly shouts, \"That building\u0027s chimney is smoking.\" Indeed, you view the house he pointed to. Like the others, it has a golden emblem with writing you can\u0027t really understand on its door, but  it, unlike the others, has a chimney still protruding some sort of gas. That means somebody is inside...\n\nYou turn around to nod back to him before hopping to the active laboratory. With Nordim following, you kick in the door with a heavy slam, making the oak-door fly off it\u0027s hinges and several into the room. You hustle inside, only to find an extremely hot room-- as if an oven, and man in a chair with his back towards you, unnoticing.\n\nHis head is filled with mangled hair while some parts of his scalp are heavily scarred and hairless, as if his head was patched together wit a sewing machine. The man\u0027s neck shows out as a pale green, though you can\u0027t tell anything else from your position.\n\n\"Nordim...\" you whisper, \"Move to the side to get a better view. I\u0027ll go on this side.\"\n\nHe complies, and as you begin to flank the figure, you notice yet another thing. It\u0027s... It\u0027s dead!\n\nThe figure, somehow turns to meet your eyes, its own gaunt and devoid of everything. You can see where it\u0027s flayed nose waas reassembled and where half of its face was replaced with some sort of leather-like material. Its bulging muscles show out a bulky figure under a large white labcoat. Oddly enough, the Frankenstein-like monster has deformed limbs that resemble common tools-- one of its hands shaped like  some sort of makeshift hatchet and the other a hammer-head. Suddenly, it fall off the office chair with a slump, face-planting into the floor in front of you, it\u0027s lower-body perked up.\n\nShocked, you jump back. You notice Nordim gawking at something behind you, but before you can even turn around two flashing shards are flung from behind you and into Nordim\u0027s neck, letting blood spill out as he begins to choke on it.\n\n\"It\u0027s been a while, hasn\u0027t it, kiddo? I must say, I didn\u0027t expect you to come here.\" Comes a voice from behind.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" You spit, turning around to see nothing but blackness, leading into the darker sections of the oven. Goddammit. Nordim\u0027s dead... Who is this bastard?\n\nYou hear a weak thud, and find a figure only slightly shorter than you to your side. You swing at it, only for your forearm to be caught by its cold grasp.\n\n\"Hey now... Relax.\" Bringing his face out of the shadows, you slowly begin to remember just whom\u0027s this stern yet father-like face belongs to.\n\n\"Kelso!?\" You exclaim, shocked. He lets your hand drop before embracing you with a hug.\n\n\"Yes, my son...\" He replies before you throw him off of you, his body clanging on a steaming metal machine.\n\n\"What the actual hell?\" You shout, confused beyond measure. Kelso raises his hands fro you to relax.\n\n\"Vampire, relax. You have succeeded, it worked.\"\n\n\"What worked? You just killed my friend!\"\n\n\"It was necessary, his reveal would make this much harder.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"As I said, I didn\u0027t expect you to find me here. I just got done killing Stein, but I hoped Gideon\u0027s warning would make you wait. But, well, maybe I did make you too independent. Probably a mistake in the long-run, but worked out enough. I mean, wow! You took control of the Zealot\u0027s city! Good work.\"\n\nWhat? \"Wait a second... You must be... you\u0027re...\"\n",
  "page 197": "\"I think it\u0027s worth checking them out. Worst case scenario we\u0027ll have to fight them, but I doubt they want a conflict.\"\n\n\"What makes you say that?\" Nordim whispers as you tilt the direction of your course slightly more to the West. It\u0027s a small while away- maybe two miles down, but the flame they have going is the only thing in a twelve-mile radius that isn\u0027t dark, so it\u0027s extremely noticeable from where you are. Not from the City, however-- they\u0027ve cleverly hid it behind a sand-dune.\n\n\"Mixture of optimism and logic. I\u0027d think that they would have tried infiltrating us if they wanted to just fight. Instead they wander around aimlessly, avoiding sight when possible.\"\n\n\"Why do you think they haven\u0027t knocked for entrance to our City, then?\"\n\n\"What\u0027s with it with you and all of these questions?\" You sigh, \"But your guess is as good as mine on that one. I guess we\u0027ll find out.\"\n\nSoon later, you find yourself within shouting distance of the Nomads, who have two people awake and on watch, keeping the fire lit in the process. Of course, you don\u0027t yell to them, but as you creep forward you realize that not startling them will be a hard task.\n\n\"Nordim, how should we alert them of our presence?\" You ask, hoping he has an idea.\n\n\"Um, what about walking with our hands up?\" He shrugs, \"Can\u0027t think of anything else.\"\n\nWith a nod, you and the teenaged Wolf begin walking slowly, with your hands high in the air, towards the encampment. Oddly enough, the guard staring in your direction doesn\u0027t seem to do anything aside from stare at you blankly.\n\n\"Hello?\" You say calmly, waving your hands at them. Suddenly, the guard watching the other-side turns around to see you, his shocked expression changing to frustration, where he slaps the other watchmen, who topples over, a bottle falling down from his off-hand. The sober guard gets up, slowly approaching the two of you.\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asks, with a heavy Indian accent. The man is dressed in some sort of surplice, though you somehow doubt he\u0027s from any specific Church.\n\n\"Inhabitants of the City. Who are you?\"\n\nThe Indian man lets out a large sigh of relief, \"Oh good. I was worried... Worried you were of a different affiliation. I am Daitya, of the City Hasep.\" Daitya gives you a hand to shake.\n\nYou don\u0027t accept it just yet, \"I\u0027m Vamp. Why the hell are you and your group wandering around our City?\"\n\n\"You are Lord Vahmp?\" The man states, his eyes widening in fear. He kneels down to the ground, kissing at your feet.\n\n\"What of it?\" You spit, looking down at the crazed man. \"Stop that.\"\n\n\"No no no...\" He states, though he stops with the feet. \"I have heard tales of you and your kingdom. Hasep have found pale men wandering through the desert telling of your tale. It is very amazing, my lord.\"\n\nWell, that explains what happens to some of the missing scouts we send out. \"What is your business then?\"\n\n\"I am a simple merchant.\" Daitya states, grinning to the point that his grimy teeth show.\n\n\"No,\" you sigh, \"what are you and your group doing here? I\u0027ve asked this before, though you have avoided answering it.\"\n\n\"My lord!\" He cries out, rousing some of his group, \"We are here to warn you!\"\n\n\"Then why didn\u0027t you just try to enter the City?\"\n\n\"We do not contact you directly because that is not our custom. You must seek us out and find us before we share our information.\"\n\nYou rub your palm against your forehead in response. \"Okay... So now that I \u0027sought you out\u0027, what is your warning?\"\n\n\"Of great calamity, my lord!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean  that the cursed one is searching for you, and soon he will find out that the City is yours, and that he can finally claim you once more.\"\n\n\"The cursed one?\" You ask, confused. This seems oddly reminiscent of what Gideon said...\n\n\"He means the Professor.\" Nordim states, quivering in fear.\n\n\"What does the Professor want from me?\"\n\n\"He wants your soul, my Lord. But you mustn\u0027t give it to him! He gives forth claims of future prosperity, domineering of the world, but it is all for nil if his plan succeeds!\" Daitya says,\n\nYou stroke your chin, \"We\u0027re on our way to find and kill the \u0027cursed one\u0027 right now, actually--\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t listen to his lies!\" Daitya yells once more, getting up just so that he can shove his finger right in front of your face. \"Our shamans have said that he will be of familiar acquaintance to you, but you shalt not beckon to his words!\"\n\nAwkwardly, you move his finger away. \"... Right. I don\u0027t exactly plan on it.\"\n\nHe continues pointing, \"Don\u0027t!\"\n\nThe rest of Daitya\u0027s crew stare at you in awe, but make no sounds as he starts yelling at them in a foreign language, waving his arms wildly as if to tell them to get up. \"Our work is done here. We leaving now!\" When it is obvious that Daitya has little more to say, the nomads slowly begin to pack up their sleeping bags and tents.\n\nAs you and Nordim turn your backs away to leave the wack-jobs, the Indian man yells a hearty goodbye-- though neither of you give a response.\n\nWell, that was odd.\n",
  "page 178": "Ragnor nods, \"Indeed, Gideon was never... Violent. I just hope the year didn\u0027t change his root-being.\"\n\nYou continue your own march toward the South, leaping over the barb-wire fence, its deathly spikes glistening in the hot sun, and get closer to the incoming Zealots.\n\n\"That\u0027s fifteen of them, excluding Gideon.\" You say, noticing something off, \"Assuming those Zealots are the ones from all the way back when-- before we took the City, then there should be forty more of them with Gideon.\"\n\n\"They might have died,\" he shrugs, \"I\u0027m telling you, Gideon must have somehow convinced them he was innocent, and by the time they got back to defend the City we had already taken control of the City. Realizing that they had no hope to take it back, they must have fled the 40 miles back.\" Ragnor glares at you once more, \"How many do you think survived that trek?\"\n\nYour silence is your answer.\n\nSoon enough, you are close enough to recognize Gideon, in all of his hunchbacked glory. He raises his hands above his eyes to see the two of you better, and leaves out his hand to signal the Zealots about something, likely to not attack. You can see him grimacing, looking much more ragged than before.\n\n\"Ragnor... and Vamp!\" Comes his roar, him jogging up to the two of you, his feet kicking sand as he does so. He stops within arms-length of you, coughing as he lets out a hand to shake. He raises his hand, expectantly.\n\nYou don\u0027t bother-- this man betrayed his kind, after all.\n\n\"What is it, old friend?\" Ragnor asks, obviously acting out of courtesy more than anything else. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Here,\" he coughs, \"To warn the Vampire of something.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, \"What is it?\"\n\nGideon raises his eyes to meet yours, and you can notice from his huffing and puffing that he\u0027s exhausted, tired and haggard. He doesn\u0027t answer.\n\n\"What is it?\" You repeat with a hint of annoyance.\n\n\"He\u0027s coming.\" GIdeon states slowly, \"The monster... He is coming to your City... To reclaim what is his!\"\n\nYou shake your head, \"What are you talking about, you old fool? Just spit it out, Gideon. We don\u0027t have time for this.\"\n\n\"He...\" Gideon coughs, falling to his knees in anguish. You notice something-- He has a gash near his abdomen, the blood shows out in his shirt...\n\n\"Who did this to you?\" Ragnor exclaims, noticing it as well. \"Gideon, we can take care of you inside the City walls, come with me!\"\n\n\"No!\" Gideon snarls, getting up and grabbing you by the cuff, \"this is because of you! You bloody bastard, Vamp. He\u0027s coming because of you!\"\n\nYou push the shorter man off of yourself and onto the ground, \"Stop it. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The Professor is COMING!\" Gideon cries out, tears starting to pour down his pathetically twisted face, \"He\u0027s wants you, Vampire. He wants you to join him... This is why he made you convince the Wolves to destroy the Church...\n\n\"Speak straight you old fool!\" You yell, agitated by his vagueness.\n\n\"No no no...\" Gideon continues, slowly getting up. \"You will die, Vampire, before Simon Kurschner can take you back under his wing, before he can ruin more of Humanity!\"\n\nSuddenly, the hunchback gives you a nasty head-butt, sending you on your rear end and blurring your vision for a moment-- as Ragnor tenses up for a fight, so do the Zealots...\n\nBut they are Zealots no more. You slowly see them change out of their armor, it bursting off of them as they grow at least a foot more in height, several feet in width and body-mass. Muscles bulging and hair sprouting from their faces, they seem like they\u0027re Wolves but not quite... It can\u0027t be, Wolves can ghoul?\n\nYou get back up to see Gideon-- now a huge white Wolf, wrestling with a black one-- Ragnor. The two of them wrestle, and you yell as loud as you can so that some of the civilians-- maybe the Ghoul party you saw not so long ago, will hear you and call for everybody to take up arms and back you and Ragnor up.\n\nBut, for now, you need to keep the two of you alive long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Hopefully they got ready like I told them...\n\nYou shove that thought out of your mind. The moment you see Ragnor struggle with Gideon, you rush the white wolf, confident you can take him down yourself-- Ragnor is better fit to fight the other werewolves.\n\n\"Gideon, what the hell is going on?\" You yell, him snapping his teeth at you. He tries to bite you with his pearly whites, but he evidently didn\u0027t expect you to do the same thing.\n\nYou dig your teeth into his snout, almost in a kissing formation except you\u0027re both biting. Having the smaller maw, you have a slight advantage and bite first, hitting a mixture of fur, skin of lip, and hared, ivory teeth. You both groan horribly, you chipping one of your teeth and his black lips bursting forth with blood and one of his teeth hanging loose. While in pain, you push him off of you with a swift kick to the abdomen, which you notice didn\u0027t do much. He lands a heavy swipe with his beefy and hairy forearms, sending you back several meters and onto the sandy floor.\n\nYou cough and quickly push yourself back up. A quick glance shows you that Ragnor isn\u0027t fairing too well- the 12 werewolves left pounding on him mercilessly in consecutive turns.\n\nGoddammit, it must have been ten minutes already... How much longer until they come?\n\nYou quickly jump up to slash Gideon, high enough so that his limited use his neck can be used as an advantage. You claws dig deep into his eye, and the wolf howls, clutching it and sending another swipe at you-- but you dodge it this time.\n\nYour hands bloodied, you strike again at his other eye, and the blood seeping out of both, as well as his n ow random swipes prove to you that you have at least blinded him. You quickly run over to help body Ragnor out, only to find his huge half-buried in sand.\n\nYou look up to find the Zealots looking at you hungrily, edging closer every moment...\n\n\"Vamp! We\u0027re here!\" Comes a cry from the distance. You look behind you to see Cecilia and others bounding up to you when you find yourself flung back several more meters when a heavy fist lands on your cheek.\n\nYou grunt once more, only this time you have your clan behind you, ready to help you fight the remaining twelve Werewolves. They approach your six ghouls, paralleling them by line. Your own wolves, now morphed, prepare themselves to fight. You get up, ready to fight together with them.\n\nYou start the second confrontation by leaping at the closest one, swiping at his neck. He catches you in mid-air, and after holding you there for several moments he smashes you head first into the rough sand. What happens afterwards you are unsure of, but you manage to get out of your grave and find the area in absolute chaos.\n\nPoor Allen, the kid-Wolf, you notice was ripped apart by the Werewolves, who seem to be ganging up together to quickly kill their adversaries before the actual Wolves can stop them. You run in to stop them, but you in particular have a problem with standing straight against them-- they\u0027re quick, experienced, and just too strong. Every time you get close they simply fling you away and continue their fighting spree.\n\nYou see them beginning to gang up on Darla, and run up from behind one of them to strangle him from the back-- and give Darla just enough time to...\n\nNo. The she-Wolf is bludgeoned by one of the werewolves\u0027 heavy fists, and now lays on the floor. Meanwhile, you continue to strangle one of them, your small figure strong enough to get a powerful but not sturdy enough to hold on-- and so you sink your teeth into him, your anger-levels rising to a point that this lets you hold on better. The blood from his shoulder pours into your mouth, and you suck it in, absorbing all of its properties...\n\nYou black out.\n\n\nCecilia tells you that you saved them, but you somehow doubt it. Your memory is fuzzy enough that it could be true, but the one thing you know is that barely anybody is left.\n\nThe Creations left are perhaps four now-- Shamino, Cecilia, Nordim, and yourself. You imagine it could be worse, but...\n\n\"Don\u0027t beat yourself up about it,\" Nordim says near your bedside, \"It was a tough fight... If you and Ragnor didn\u0027t fight so hard all those other Wolves could have walked straight into town and performed some sort of massacre. Lord, just- just relax for now.\"\n\n\"Stop calling me that!\" You say, getting up. But, for the first time since your nose injury, you feel pain lingering, \"Ah!\"\n\n\"That must be one of your ribs, it isn\u0027t healing properly.\" Cecilia says sorrowfully, dabbing it with a wet cloth. \"I don\u0027t know what caused it, but I imagine it should get better at some point, with your regeneration and all.\"\n\nYou nod to her, and look back at Shamino, \"Shamino, we\u0027re family now. We\u0027ve both saved each other\u0027s lives several times in the past year. What we need now is unity. The four of us.\"\n\nNordim looks to you with a frown, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nWith a deep breath, you close your eyes to explain, \"Gideon said... Before he attacked us, that the Professor is coming... For me.\"\n\nCecilia gasped, but your hand-motion tells her to be silent. \"I don\u0027t know what he wants from me, but quite simply this means that it ain\u0027t over. Things are happening that we are unaware of, and we have to choose how to approach them. I don\u0027t know when he\u0027ll strike, but he wants something. I just... Don\u0027t know... What is is...\"\n\nNordim visibly shivers, \"Th-then.... What- what are we going t-t-to d-do?\"\n",
  "page 177": "They stand up for Ragnor and your departure, and as soon as you close the door you begin to hear chatter forming from behind the door. \"Come on, then, Vampire Lord.\" Ragnor states, motioning for you to lead.\n\n\"Ragnor... You know that \u0027title\u0027 ticks me off.\"\n\n\"Which is kinda why I like saying it,\" Ragnor jokes with a grin. Seeing your discomfort, his face turns serious again, \"It\u0027s necessary, though. We need a leader, especially as time passes and the Ghouls will begin to stop being so submissive to us. You\u0027re a hero to us, the Wolves, whether you like it or not.\"\n\nYou nod, not really sure how to explain your discomfort to it. Out of everybody you interact with, only 2 are really casual with you-- Cecilia and Ragnor. To be honest, you\u0027d rather being casual with everyone, but it\u0027s simply not possible when you\u0027re constantly being referred to as \u0027Vampire Lord\u0027 like some sort of king. Which... I sort of am, even if my kingdom simply consists of genetically engineered advisors, angry plebeians, and a barb-wire fence.\n\nYou continue through the streets of Home, moving South as per the direction of a makeshift compass one of the Ghouls treasured. You pass by several Ghouls, who sneer at the two highest-ranking beings in the city with distaste, but do nothing to stop you and Ragnor from going past them.\n\n\"The civilians especially will need to recognize you as some sort of lord before they can warm up to us. You just need to continue watching them and help them out every once in a while when they complain.\"\n\n\"Why don\u0027t we just give you a title?\"\n\n\"Because I don\u0027t want one.\"\n\nYour laugh is cut short when you reach the fence surrounding the City. From the distance, you can see what Simon was talking about, though the sun gets in the way of noticing specific features. Thankfully, you have a pretty thick hood to protect you from the ever-blazing sun-- you ran out of lotion not too long ago. There was some sort of helmet Cecilia gave you to wear, but you decided it was too intimidating to wear around town, even if it was comfortable enough and protected you from the sun.\n\n\"Ragnor, you see \u0027em?\"\n\n\"Yeah... Vamp, do you recognize the man in sackcloth?\"\n\n\"I\u0027d have to move closer to get more details in, so I\u0027m afraid not.\"\n\n\"It\u0027s Gideon.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m certain of it. That glorious bastard must have convinced the Zealots to follow him. He probably taught them to fight during the year, too. This is going to be a much harder battle than we once thought if it gets that far.\"\n\n\"So what should we do? The Wolves have no idea that we\u0027re going to be fighting-- I told them to focus on that supply-report we wanted to discuss in the first place.\"\n\n\"Well, we can gather everybody to fight head-on or try to approach Gideon and his men more carefully. I\u0027m not sure which way we should go, though. Do you think Gideon had a heart big enough to not try to trample us if only the two of us go out to meet him? The problem with that is that the Wolves aren\u0027t ready in case we need it... Meanwhile, gathering everyone to fight them head-on seems rather hasty. We don\u0027t know why they\u0027re here, after all.\"\n",

  "page 179": "You turn back, quickly finding the group of Ghouls whom you passed, \"Quickly! Notify everybody to prepare for a fight!\" The Ghouls nod and begin to frantically scatter through the City, spreading the news. Within minutes other civilians get out of their homes and gather outside, and about twenty minutes later your apostles appear.\n\nBy now, Gideon and his troops are close enough to be heard-- obviously not making any attempt to remain stealthy. His gang of former-Zealots appear weary, shuffling slowly towards the fence. It\u0027s been a long travel for them, no doubt, which makes you wonder, are they really looking for a fight?\n\nRagnor digs a claw into his chest, making several bloody holes appear that are quickly covered up by a thick black fur. His muscles begin to grow, and he begins to tower over you and resonate heat. A hideous maw begins to drool onto the floor as his snout lengthens and his shoulders jerk as he morphs into his Wolf persona. The Wolves behind you do similarly.\n\nTaking advantage of Gideon and his men\u0027s weak status, the Wolves, several enthusiastic ghouls, and yourself begin to charge them. What you find is extraordinary.\n\nEven though the incoming Zealots have no idea what\u0027s coming for them, they fight. Harder than you\u0027d expect from people so exhausted. As Ragnor begins bounding for the obviously surprised Gideon, who manages to morph into a beautiful White Wolf just as he gets bum-rushed by the Dark one. As they wrestle, you suddenly find the 15 (you counted from afar) Zealots breaking out of their armors, which fly off of them like a thrown tin can as they begin to grow tremendously, but not quite-like actual Wolves. They\u0027re hair is thinner, and they maintain a more human face, but otherwise... Shit. Did Gideon ghoul them or something? This is bad...\n\nWhile surprised, your own army spreads forward, attacking the Zealots with increased speed and bloodlust. Ragnor is thrown by Gideon like a rag-doll, hitting the fence while Gideon moves in closer to the City-- closer to you.\n\nAs he charges you, you begin to sprint in his direction as well-- building momentum to leap, twist, and kick the White Wolf in his snout. The force of your kick was felt, but at best it disoriented him for several seconds. He still manages to get you into a bear hug, and begins to squeeze as well as dig his claws into your skin. You cry out in pain as you find yourself trapped against the beast\u0027s chest, your head immovable though against his forearm.\n\nDesperate, you sink your teeth into his arm, getting hair and blood in your mouth. Gideon loosens his\n\n\"I didn\u0027t...\" He coughs out blood, \"Want to fight you, here, Vamp. Something is coming, I wanted to warn you...\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" You snarl back, releasing your claws from his throat.\n\n\"Beware... The Professor, Vampy. You know him. I think. I can\u0027t... He\u0027s coming... for you!\" His eyes turn to white-- Gideon\u0027s dead.\n\nYou take a look around to analyze the devastation surrounding you: Ragnor choked on his own blood when flung into the -apparently- silver barbed wire; Darla was messily slashed in the neck; Shamino died while strangling two of the half-wolves, his corpse slumped over two Zealots; Simon lays, his head buried in sand; and the human-form of Allen lays near you, inaudibly speaking. While you sit near him, crying over him, he barely whispers out, \"We served you well, right, my lord?\"\n\nWait, can I save him? Not hesitating, you attempt to ghoul him before he dies, draining him of all his blood by sinking your teeth into his wrist. \"I don\u0027t want to live anymore, Lord. I\u0027ve done my duty. Let me be...\" He murmurs, dying regardless of your efforts. Realizing there is nothing more you can do, you look around again.\n\nCecilia... Is alive. A limp arm and missing an eye, but alive. She morphs out of her form, and goes over to you with tears streaming down her lovely face, hugging you tightly. Nordim appears, solemnly frowning and unsure what to say.\n\nDays pass, and you find yourself in the make-shift infirmary. You didn\u0027t notice it until now, but you seem to have a sustained injury in your midsection. Every-time you try to get up-- it hurts.\n\n\"Relax, Vamp.\" Cecilia says, dabbing it, perhaps in vain, with a wet cloth. \"I don\u0027t know what caused this injury, but I imagine it\u0027ll heal.\" She pauses, \"At least, as much as your nose did.\"\n\nYou let out a weak chuckle, \"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\"\n\nNordim leans over you, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"This is the last of us. We\u0027re the last Creations left.\"\n\nThe two remain silent, and you once again try to get up. \"Ah!\"\n\n\"Relax, my lord. You saved us once again, I can\u0027t imagine where\u0027d the City be if you didn\u0027t fight as you did.\"\n\n\"Stop calling me that!\" You state angrily, \"We\u0027re closer than that, aren\u0027t we?

You notice something-- He has a gash near his abdomen, the blood shows out in his shirt...\n\n\"Who did this to you?\" Ragnor exclaims, noticing it as well. \"Gideon, we can take care of you inside the City walls, come with me!\"\n\n\"No!\" Gideon snarls, getting up and grabbing you by the cuff, \"this is because of you! You bloody bastard, Vamp. He\u0027s coming because of you!\"\n\nYou push the shorter man off of yourself and onto the ground, \"Stop it. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The Professor is COMING!\" Gideon cries out, tears starting to pour down his pathetically twisted face, \"He\u0027s wants you, Vampire. He wants you to join him... This is why he made you convince the Wolves to destroy the Church...\n\n\"Speak straight you old fool!\" You yell, agitated by his vagueness.\n\n\"No no no...\" Gideon continues, slowly getting up. \"You will die, Vampire, before Simon Kurschner can take you back under his wing, before he can ruin more of Humanity!\"\n\nSuddenly, the hunchback gives you a nasty head-butt, sending you on your rear end and blurring your vision for a moment-- as Ragnor tenses up for a fight, so do the Zealots...\n\nBut they are Zealots no more. You slowly see them change out of their armor, it bursting off of them as they grow at least a foot more in height, several feet in width and body-mass. Muscles bulging and hair sprouting from their faces, they seem like they\u0027re Wolves but not quite... It can\u0027t be, Wolves can ghoul?\n\nYou get back up to see Gideon-- now a huge white Wolf, wrestling with a black one-- Ragnor. The two of them wrestle, and you yell as loud as you can so that some of the civilians-- maybe the Ghoul party you saw not so long ago, will hear you and call for everybody to take up arms and back you and Ragnor up.\n\nBut, for now, you need to keep the two of you alive long enough for reinforcements to arrive. But I told them not to get ready...\n\nYou shove that thought out of your mind. The moment you see Ragnor struggle with Gideon, you rush the white wolf, confident you can take him down yourself-- Ragnor is better fit to fight the other werewolves.\n\n\"Gideon, what the hell is going on?\" You yell, him snapping his teeth at you. He tries to bite you with his pearly whites, but he evidently didn\u0027t expect you to do the same thing.\n\nYou dig your teeth into his snout, almost in a kissing formation except you\u0027re both biting. Having the smaller maw, you have a slight advantage and bite first, hitting a mixture of fur, skin of lip, and hared, ivory teeth. You both groan horribly, you chipping one of your teeth and his black lips bursting forth with blood and one of his teeth hanging loose. While in pain, you push him off of you with a swift kick to the abdomen, which you notice didn\u0027t do much. He lands a heavy swipe with his beefy and hairy forearms, sending you back several meters and onto the sandy floor.\n\nYou cough and quickly push yourself back up. A quick glance shows you that Ragnor isn\u0027t fairing too well- the 12 werewolves left pounding on him mercilessly in consecutive turns.\n\nGoddammit, it must have been ten minutes already... How much longer until they come?\n\nYou quickly jump up to slash Gideon, high enough so that his limited use his neck can be used as an advantage. You claws dig deep into his eye, and the wolf howls, clutching it and sending another swipe at you-- but you dodge it this time.\n\nYour hands bloodied, you strike again at his other eye, and the blood seeping out of both, as well as his n ow random swipes prove to you that you have at least blinded him. You quickly run over to help Ragnor out, only to find him half-buried in sand.\n\nThe Zealots look at you hungrily...\n\n\nYou have been killed by Gideon and his rebels.\n",
  "page 183": "Days turn to weeks which turn to months, and before you know it has almost been another year. By now your physical wounds have healed, leaving negligible cars that only contribute to your rugged exterior. Your hair, then-white-now-nonexistent, leaves your profile bald and fully pale, giving you an elderly look, almost like the Nosferatu on the cover of the leftover Zealot propaganda. Not that you really mind it-- the external only means so much. If anything, it gives you more power over the ghouls, them completely under your command now, perhaps in fear, but at the very least subservient. The past year went well, with the Ghouls respecting you- no, in complete awe of you that they are perfectly agreeable no matter what you command them to carry out. You work with them and teach them to fight, to make use of their newfound abilities and to harness it. Although you\u0027re waiting for the day the Professor comes for you, you\u0027re still sending scouting teams filled with trust worthy ghouls to search for new settlements that perhaps turned up. So far, little has been found, and you\u0027ve been especially careful not to seek things out in the South.\n\nOccasionally, you have found reports of small camp-grounds forming, though every time you send back more scouts to check, the results come up with nothing. Perhaps they actually do exist, the camps, but they\u0027re so far out that they don\u0027t matter. If they wished to join the City they would have by now, since it\u0027s the only noticeable settlement within at least fifty miles-- you\u0027ve checked. As such, while you expend some of your efforts to find them, for the sake of making your empire grow, you yourself don\u0027t care too much about it. Your energies are at a standstill until you meet your Creator, whenever he will appear.\n\nAfter a night\u0027s meditation, you wake, as per usual, to Cecilia\u0027s naked grasp. Nothing happened the previous night, of course, and as such just getting up and leaving without a word is what you do. Your abode is just a regular house, and exiting it is just the beginning of another bland day, waiting for the day he comes for you.\n\nYou begin your typical rounds-- you have several more human mouths to feed, babies to be exact. The humans you set aside have been enacting God\u0027s plan perfectly, already making several children in only two years of effort. It may be hard, but you manage to help scavenge food for the surviving humans-- typically canned foods deep in the abandoned storage areas.\n\nAfterwards you go back to the Zealot-HQ to witness the Ghouls, who have by now realized how to store the blood efficiently and without contamination from the humans, that are somehow still alive. Well, physically. Mentally you\u0027ve noticed that nothing is left from them, just robots. And, yet, they refuse to become actual ghouls. It\u0027s mind boggling.\n\nYou continue to speak with Cecilia and Nordim, both of whom are extremely close to you. You could say Cecilia is like a wife to you, and Nordim like a son. You discuss the issues of the time-- food, shelter, loneliness. After all, until you manage to find the nomads who occasionally get close enough to spot, you three are the only truly sentient beings left. Even with the constant duty of making sure the city is running correctly, things get repetitive, and you need to reach new goals-- currently, you have reached a static. After discussion, you decide that you really have to actively search for the others, perhaps they are other Creations, or maybe just more humans-- it really doesn\u0027t matter, the two remaining Wolves just want to have more verbally active companions, unlike the City Ghouls.\n\nThe day ending already, you retire in your study to get away from it all, situated in the Church building. You have a very special seat, with wheels even, where you sit down to think, waiting for your informants to give you reports of the happenings within the city. After waiting for a while, you consider just getting up and going back to meditating until the next day, where perhaps something more exciting would happen.\n\nAs you push your hands down on the chair\u0027s arms, you hear something.\n\n\"Hey there, kid.\" Comes a voice from above.\n\nYou glance above and around you, wondering where exactly the sound is coming from. All of a sudden, you feel an eerie presence from above. You feel it-- like a cold wind, only it\u0027s not a physical feeling, a tingling down your spine that makes your entire body shiver. You sit yourself back down and close your eyes. \"Is it time already? Your time to claim me?\"\n\n\"What? No, no no. This is an old friend.\" Although you don\u0027t hear anything, you get the distinct feeling that someone dropped behind you.\n\nA white haired man, aged in his face with creased lines lay on his forehead, a posture so very straight, and a heavy white coat reaching all the way down to his knees covers the rest of his body completely. Despite the differences in attire, it is undeniable--\n\n\"Kelso?\" You gasp, nearly jumping out of your chair. You settle for simply standing, \"What... What are you doing here? It\u0027s been so long!\"\n\n\"Indeed, my son. I am very happy you still remember me.\" Is his reply. He bears a pleasant grin, apparently pleased beyond measure. \"You\u0027ve done well for yourself, I see.\"\n\n\"You can say that,\" you laugh, \"But you\u0027ve missed out on a lot. As you can see, we took over the Church\u0027s City and converted it to our own needs, and it\u0027s growing, it\u0027s doing good.\"\n\n\"Very, even better than I hoped.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nSuddenly, the door to your study opens, \"Vamp, the Ghouls are petitioning for more blood...\" Nordim says as he enters the study, but when he views Kelso, he suddenly stops. His expression is of total horror as he waves a finger at your mentor, \"V-vamp! It\u0027s... the--the Prof--\" Suddenly, Kelso turns around, flinging to silver shards into Nordim\u0027s neck. The teenager falls over, dead.\n\n\"Such... a nuisance...\" Kelso coughs out. He stares back at you and your shocked expression.\n\nAs he continues to cackle, it suddenly dawns on you...\n",
  "page 185": "The next couple days are followed by weeks of preparation.

And, well, you-- you\u0027re just great, love. I trust that you can make sure everything is in order when we come back.\" You say, trying to make her feel better.\n\n\"I know, my love. Just make sure you come back in one piece, alright?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" She lays her head on your chest for a small while before releasing her grasp around you. She smiles at you before turning around and leaving.\n\nThat night, with several knapsacks filled with blood-packs and syringes, Nordim and yourself begin your long trek through the desert. You considered bringing Ghouls for this, but decided against it when you realized just how long you\u0027ll be away for. At least a week, I\u0027d say. The Ghouls aren\u0027t used to that kind of traveling, and might even get in the way.\n\n\"Vamp?\" Comes Nordim\u0027s voice from behind you.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"If we really do find the Professor, what are we going to do to him?\"\n\n\"Kill him, of course,\" you reply, with barely an afterthought. \"We need to stop him from getting any of his Facilities up and running again, lest he manage to create more troubled souls for his expirments.\"\n\nHe nods, \"Alright. But what do we do if we don\u0027t find him?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"If we were to find another civilization, like of the Zealots, who are building they\u0027re way into a form of prosperity, well, relative prosperity, what wll we do with them?\"\n\n\"Variable.\" You reply with a shrug. I\u0027ll cross that bridge when I come to it.\n\nThe harsh desert is rough against your metal garb, the particles finding their way into your boots and making your walking awkward. It\u0027s a minor complaint, but it\u0027s bound to get annoying by the end of a forty mile trip. Nordim remains silent for a lot of the walking, the young Wolf just muttering to himself inane nonesense.\n\nEventually, you just have to ask about it, \"Hey, what are you talking to yourself about?\"\n\n\"Nothing...\" is his quick reply. You sigh, realizing that making small-talk is not a skill a lot of people possess. After dragging your feet several miles, the moon hanging above you like a white lantern, you notice something bizzare. Fire... In the middle of the desert?\n\n\"Nordim, what\u0027s that over there? Are those the nomads?\" You ask beckoning him over to witness the group of 18 begin a nightly shift.\n\n\"Woah. Should we, like, you know, approach them or something?\"\n\n\"Hmm, I\u0027m honestly not sure. It\u0027s amazing that we were able to catch them, though. This might be our best chance to find out who they really are. Problem is that we\u0027d lose out on some miles that we can still wedge in for the night.\"\n\nNordim raises an eyebrow, \"You think it\u0027s worth it?\"\n\n\"Can\u0027t see why not.

  "page 187": "\"Yes, it is true, hahahaha.\" Kelso remarks, now facing you again. His face has contorted into an ugly sneer, half of it hidden by a shadow. \"I am your Creator, Simon Kurschner.\"\n\nEverything I\u0027ve done until now... All of it... He\u0027s been stringing along...\n\nThe Professor continues, \"I suppose this may take a small while  to digest, so I recommend for you to sit down.\"\n\nHe gives you a slight push on your chest, and you unwillingly fall down to the chair.\n\n\"Where was I... Yes, to put it simply, you were my best Creation.\"\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" You snarl back at him, gaining the will to at the very least sit firmly in your chair. Taking over the City. That was part of his plan. Convincing the Wolves to take down the one faction powerful enough to oppose him... And I carried it out... As his messenger.\n\n\"Exactly what I said, immortal one. You aren\u0027t my strongest Creation, I imagine you realized that by now, but you\u0027re easily the most... adaptable, you see. You can live forever, you can spawn kin a lot more efficiently than any other monster I created. You are the perfect heir to carry on my work. I am old-- I imagine I shall die in several years. You were perfect-- you didn\u0027t remember anything of your past life, and as such I was able to mold you into a new shell, a new being. You were the last Vampire I created, too, and the only one which survived Facility 13\u0027s destruction. I taught you what was necessary to your survival... Anger and power. Fire and brimstone is what creates the best men, the people who can carry out a mission.\" You notice a twinkle in his eye as he brings his face closer to yours. \"And you did it perfectly. You used your anger, ironically your anger for myself, to stop at nothing to gain the power to find me, and then you found a loving for your brethren, and those two bonds-- vengeance and brotherhood, is what gave you the power to take over an ENTIRE city filled with Zealots! Something I realized that I myself couldn\u0027t do. The other Creations wouldn\u0027t listen to me, but you! Oh you...\" He beams once again at you.\n\n\"And you expect me to just join you after all the lies? After you yourself bred me to hate you?\"\n\n\"Remember this, boy, I saved your life. I am your Creator and father-- what I did was necessary, for you, so that you\u0027d have the drive to complete this task. Don\u0027t you see it? What we can do together?\"\n\nSeeing your resistance, he sighs, \"Now, it is your choice, my student. You can join me, use your resources here to help me rule the World. Lay waste to the surviving civilizations still building themselves up from the Calamity of the past. They exist-- I have spent the past two years finding them, gathering information on them. Together, we can accomplish so many things, usher in a new age, larger and better than before! Bring life to this deserted plane, create a new world with us as its founders. I made sure-- none of the major Creations are left. You took care of Gideon, and Ragnor was killed too, of course. I made sure Stein was killed, and the rest were charred in the factory fires. You yourself were a major one, even though you conveniently forgot everything. The dynasty will continue with you, mattering on what you decide. Join me, so we can be Gods of the New World!\"\n",

Worst case scenario we\u0027ll have to fight them, but I doubt they want a conflict.\"\n\n\"What makes you say that?\" Nordim whispers as you tilt the direction of your course slightly more to the West. It\u0027s a small while away- maybe two miles down, but the flame they have going is the only thing in a twelve-mile radius that isn\u0027t dark, so it\u0027s extremely noticeable from where you are. Not from the City, however-- they\u0027ve cleverly hid it behind a sand-dune.\n\n\"Mixture of optimism and logic.

Oddly enough, the guard staring in your direction doesn\u0027t seem to do anything aside from stare at you blankly.\n\n\"Hello?\" You say calmly, waving your hands at them. Suddenly, the guard watching the other-side turns around to see you, his shocked expression changing to frustration, where he slaps the other watchmen, who topples over, a bottle falling down from his off-hand. The sober guard gets up, slowly approaching the two of you.\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asks, with a heavy Indian accent. The man is dressed in some sort of surplice, though you somehow doubt he\u0027s from any specific Church.\n\n\"Inhabitants of the City. Who are you?\"\n\nThe Indian man lets out a large sigh of relief, \"Oh good. I was worried... Worried you were of a different affiliation. I am Daitya, of the City Hasep.\" Daitya gives you a hand to shake.\n\nYou don\u0027t accept it just yet, \"I\u0027m Vamp. Why the hell are you and your group wandering around our City?\"\n\n\"You are Lord Vahmp?\" The man states, his eyes widening in fear. He kneels down to the ground, kissing at your feet.\n\n\"What of it?\" You spit, looking down at the crazed man. \"Stop that.\"\n\n\"No no no...\" He states, though he stops with the feet. \"I have heard tales of you and your kingdom. Hasep have found pale men wandering through the desert telling of your tale. It is very amazing, my lord.\"\n\nWell, that explains what happens to some of the missing scouts we send out. \"What is your business then?\"\n\n\"I am a simple merchant.\" Daitya states, grinning to the point that his grimy teeth show.\n\n\"No,\" you sigh, \"what are you and your group doing here? I\u0027ve asked this before, though you have avoided answering it.\"\n\n\"My lord!\" He cries out, rousing some of his group, \"We are here to warn you!\"\n\n\"Then why didn\u0027t you just try to enter the City?\"\n\n\"We do not contact you directly because that is not our custom. You must seek us out and find us before we share our information.\"\n\nYou rub your palm against your forehead in response. \"Okay... So now that I \u0027sought you out\u0027, what is your warning?\"\n\n\"Of great calamity, my lord!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean  that the cursed one is searching for you, and soon he will find out that the City is yours, and that he can finally claim you once more.\"\n\n\"The cursed one?\" You ask, confused. This seems oddly reminiscent of what Gideon said...\n\n\"He means the Professor.\" Nordim states, quivering in fear.\n\n\"What does the Professor want from me?\"\n\n\"He wants your soul, my Lord. But you mustn\u0027t give it to him! He gives forth claims of future prosperity, domineering of the world, but it is all for nil if his plan succeeds!\" Daitya says,\n\nYou stroke your chin, \"We\u0027re on our way to find and kill the \u0027cursed one\u0027 right now, actually--\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t listen to his lies!\" Daitya yells once more, getting up just so that he can shove his finger right in front of your face. \"Our shamans have said that he will be of familiar acquaintance to you, but you shalt not beckon to his words!\"\n\nAwkwardly, you move his finger away. \"... Right. I don\u0027t exactly plan on it.\"\n\nHe continues pointing, \"Don\u0027t!\"\n\nThe rest of Daitya\u0027s crew stare at you in awe, but make no sounds as he starts yelling at them in a foreign language, waving his arms wildly as if to tell them to get up. \"Our work is done here. We leaving now!\" When it is obvious that Daitya has little more to say, the nomads slowly begin to pack up their sleeping bags and tents.\n\nAs you and Nordim turn your backs away to leave the wack-jobs, the Indian man yells a hearty goodbye-- though neither of you give a response.\n\nWell, that was odd.\n",
  "page 18": "Kelso rubs at his clean chin. \"Elaborate.\"\n\nYou hold up the walky-talkie, \"If they know where the Professor is, then that means they\u0027re either working for him, like you\u0027re assuming, or are just planning their vengeance; If we can get a message to them, get their attention--\"\n\n\"Then the C.E. Soldiers will get to us and them.\"\n\n\"Not unless our signal is obscure, something only a Creation would know. Can I assume that we\u0027re the only one who refer to the Professor, as, well, a professor?\"\n\nYour mentor smiles, \"Yes... That\u0027s what the greater Creations called him. Myself, the Werewolf, Stein, and several others. We all were forced under the bastard to look over Lessers, like yourself. One of them are bound to be in this town, has the smallest C.E. division in the East. We just have to hope we\u0027ll be able to handle them in the case that they\u0027re still loyal. So you want us to send a wide broadcast, maybe even a flare labeled \u0027Professor\u0027, and hope we catch some of our brethren?\"\n\n\"That,\" you continue, \"or we lure the church to us by contacting them with the Walkie, and just beat the information out of them. By the sounds of it, they\u0027d be expecting a trap, so they wouldn\u0027t bring all their operatives to this location. Hopefully they have an idea where the other Creations are. It\u0027s not a perfect plan, but it\u0027s uh, better than yours. Don\u0027t think you can just nab one like you did with the last one, now that they\u0027re probably on guard.\"\n\nKelso nods, considering both of your plans, \"Much better. Regardless, Mr. Plans, we need to train.\"\n\n\"Train, for what?\" Crossing your arms as a child would, you question Kelso. \"I feel like you\u0027re not telling me everything. Even if the plan is solid, but we need to be solid, with, umm, each-other.\"\n\nWith a chuckle, Kelso replies, \"What do you think we\u0027re doing? We\u0027re fighting against an elite military operation, as well as bio-genetically advanced Creations. We\u0027re not playing here, son, there\u0027s going to be blood. I\u0027m pretty certain that you\u0027ll be able to be very powerful if we train accordingly. This may be surprising, but I think you should cherish your undeath while it lasts. Not to mention that I\u0027d rather not jeopardize myself.\"\n\n\"... So the Creations are going to be very hostile?\"\n\nHe shrugs in return, \"Maybe, more likely than not anyhow. We\u0027re betting on whether they\u0027re still loyal or not to their Creator.\"\n\n\"Why would they still be loyal to that... that bastard?\"\n\n\"Well, he did save our lives.\" You stand in silence with a confused frown. Kelso continues. \"Mind you, he also treated us like lab rats and played with our genetic-material. That\u0027s why we\u0027re going to find him and his Creations, to put an end to it once and for all, so no one else is \u0027saved\u0027 by that man.\" You nod in understanding. Kelso and yourself... You\u0027re going to help the world together. Clean it.\n\nA hero...\n\n\"The valley of dunes at night is the best place and time. We\u0027ll train today and tomorrow, and by then you should be ready. Now, more about that plan of yours...\"\n",

  "page 11": "After asking all the questions you can think of, you watch the pained man writhe and groan. The domineering Kelso looks at his pitiful state, bends down and puts his index finger to right above where his carotid artery is, obviously sensing for the pulse. \"Here, sink your teeth in and drink.\"\n\nAlthough you are hesitant, your instincts take over as your mouth begins to water slightly, making it slightly less dry for the first time. As you bend down, you begin to feel... fangs protrude from your upper jaw. Sharp, powerful teeth, ready to satiate your hunger. Hoping to get it over with, instinct and lust takes over as you bring your head down and get your teeth stuck on top of his neck. Rich, red blood squirts with an ugly squishing sound.\n\n\"God damnit, on the artery!\"\n\nKelso grabs your neck and, pulling your fangs out of the man, forces it back on the right place. You moan, half in pleasure and the other half in disgust. It tastes... salty, filling. It tasted good, and you don\u0027t mind choking on this stuff. It\u0027s the first time you\u0027ve felt such a rush, it\u0027s like a drug...\n\nBut, on the other hand... This isn\u0027t human. This man... He\u0027s screaming, begging. Something about children and the forces of evil...\n\nAs Kelso let\u0027s you have control of your own neck again, the sudden rush ends, and you cough out the other man\u0027s blood. \"You didn\u0027t have to kill him, but he\u0027s dead now. Which is actually a good thing, but you really should be less sloppy. You missed.\" He continues to smile. Kelso begins to strip the Zealot\u0027s armor off, and hands it to you. A walkie-talkie falls to the floor and clatters, though it remains undamaged.\n\n\"Now we can begin.\" He tosses you the armor, a hoodie, and some sort of... lotion?\n\nYou catch, it reflexively, \"Begin what?\"\n\n\"Our vengeance. Tying up loose ends. Give meaning to your un-life.\"\n\n\"I... I just killed a man!\"\n\n\"Who was going to kill you. Plus, it was an accident.\"\n\nYou stand there, with bloody hands and a mouth dripping with delectable blood. Kelso... What\u0027s he up to? He... You think he\u0027s a good person, he saved you. But, this isn\u0027t right. Maybe you should get away...\n\n\"Snap out of it kid, we have a duty to fulfill. This isn\u0027t a blessing what happened to you and me, and that\u0027s why we need to kill the man who did this to us, so he can\u0027t do this to others.\"\n",
  "page 10": "Kelso stares at you, obviously contemplating how to answer.\n\n\"Don\u0027t know, don\u0027t care. Your new life begins now.\"\n\nDamn. Well, okay, doesn\u0027t seem like he\u0027s going to reveal anything...\n",

  "page 13": "\"You and me both. The Professor was a nasty sort, creating freaks of nature to...\" His face seems to strain, though for reasons you may or may not realize, \"To... for a program, you see. The Government shut the facility down early enough, but he kept the creations up and running for a while longer. When the soldiers came to burn the place down, well, that\u0027s where you and I come in. Possibly others.\"\n\n\"There are more like me and you?\" You ask, trying to absorb as much as you can before Kelso shuts up again.\n\n\"Maybe. I\u0027d be surprised if that much survived the raid. But there are certainly other experiments that the Professor did. Chimera, Were-beasts, you name it. And, of course, \u0027vampires\u0027, like you.\"\n\n\"What about yourself? I thought you were a vampire as well?\n\n\"I\u0027m a lot of things.\"\n\nA pause in the conversation occurs, before you shake your head and continue the questionnaire, \"Right... And why are the soldiers trying to kill us?\"\n\n\"I told you already, the Church, lead by a certain priest named \u0027Tomas\u0027, believes we\u0027re demonic mutants created by the Professor. They think they\u0027re cleaning the world from us. That\u0027s what they\u0027ve been doing for years, hunting down Creations on some sort of religious-killing spree. The facility which you woke up from was the last one before they destroyed it. Even though we live virtually forever, this is a curse, kid, and they realize that. As Creations, we\u0027re biologically forced to do things. We have to drink blood-- it\u0027s a necessity. The sunlight burns us, for our skin is too fair. What they don\u0027t realize is that we\u0027re also sentient beings. We were humans, once.\n\n\u0027\u0027And yet, the bastard that made us still lives somewhere out there. And I want you to help me find him. Furthermore, if we make a good enough team, we may even be able to overthrow the Church, for it\u0027s reach is strong. They\u0027re more or less the only ruling bodies the world has currently... Both of them, the Professor and the Church, are evils that need to be eradicated. We\u0027ll stop them both, just stick with me, kid.\"\n",

  "page 15": "It\u0027s like the first time you remember Kelso. His hand outstretched, asking him to join you... You shake it firmly.\n\nIt\u0027s crazy, but you trust him. Like a baby chick to the first thing it sees... It\u0027s funny. He\u0027s become of a master and more like a father. While he may not have the most moral methods, he still knows way more than you and will help you through it. Besides, the Professor no doubt know your origins, before you kill him you might even get that from him. If you stick with Kelso, that is.\n\nAs silence consumes the conversation, you attempt at conversing, \"So, the lotion...\"\n\n\"Sun-tan lotion. It wears off after a small while, but it\u0027ll protect you when it counts. Spread it on your face, wouldn\u0027t want that to peel all the way off. The hoodie and that is the best things I was able to take.\"\n\n\"So you stole it?\"\n\nHe shrugs. \"Took it. We need to hide, remember? Can\u0027t have people know about us and our condition. The soldiers are much stronger when they are in control. Also: the Zealot\u0027s armor. It\u0027s worth equipping, just need to turn off the flashy-light part.\"\n\n\"And now what?\"\n\n\"You stop asking questions and let me finish.\" He eyes you with seeming annoyance. \"We\u0027ll be finding his stronger Creations that no doubt survived this long. They\u0027re a violent lot though, which is why having you will be a big help. I figure one of them will know where the Professor is.\"\n\nAs if reading your mind, he continues, \"And we find them by trailing the C.E. Division, which have specific DNA trackers on some of us. Not you or myself, thankfully, but a good deal of the Creations were registered to the government. Government program and all... But anyhow, we\u0027re going to town soon. I say we wait at the police station, they should have an outpost there. After hearing where they are, we hitch a ride in one of their vans. Not a very elaborate plan, but it\u0027ll probably work.\"\n\nHe stares at you, as if expecting resistance. \"Unless you have a better idea?\"\n\n\"Actually...\n",
  "page 14": "Kelso sighs with an apparent annoyance. \"You\u0027re not eating him. You\u0027re going to drink his blood. I\u0027ve explained this before.\"\n\nHe sort of did, but it doesn\u0027t exactly make it better. He told you that you couldn\u0027t digest any food, but he never mentioned you\u0027d have to digest blood!\n\n\"I... I drink his blood... from the neck?\" Your knowledge about supernatural creatures is more or less non-existent, give or take whatever nerdy things you might have dabbled in high-school. Unless you were some sort of jock before then. You don\u0027t remember...\n\n\"Not necessarily. The wrist works too-- as long as you get a stream of blood in your mouth you\u0027ll be satiated. This should be easier as things go along though, since any sort of infirmary should have some blood packs for transfusions, and those are easily broken into. And you can always drink non-human blood... But this is necessary. Oh, and do remember to watch out for the diseased, bad blood isn\u0027t good for yor system.\"\n\n\"Ugh... Do we really have to kill him?\" You ask with a frown.\n\n\"Unless you want him to call upon the rest of the C.E. Crew on our asses, then yes. Either way, you need to be full before we leave this shit hole. We have work to do.\"\n",
  "page 17": "\"It seems solid enough, let\u0027s do it.\"\n\nHe nods in return, as if pondering about something. \"Then let\u0027s go.\"\n\n\"Now? Are you sure I\u0027m ready?\"\n\n\"Yes now. You\u0027re ready.\" Kelso smiles.\n\n---\n\nSuffice to say, you\u0027re pretty confident. You\u0027re in full control of your new body, and the armor you looted off the zealot may be bulky, but you\u0027d be damned if you didn\u0027t look awesome with it. All this gave your self-esteem a much needed boost before setting off to the City. Kel, as you\u0027ve come to call him, probably realized that when he offered it to you. Admittedly, it\u0027s probably why you haven\u0027t pressed him for questions on the plan; he just seems to have everything under control.\n\nNow, on the night of the full moon, Kelso\u0027s ambiguous plan will be enacted. Perhaps the full moon was completely planned, or perhaps not. Regardless, the tension can be felt in the air. Regardless, the journey to the flashy city several miles down is uneventful, save for the fascinating landscape and occasional howls that Kelso doesn\u0027t seem to hear (you\u0027ve mentioned this to him; and he took interest but told you to save it for later, as it may be important).\n\nBut yes, the landscape changed dramatically from the collection of half-buried houses that you were holed up in with Kelso. From complete, uninhabited desert, to a flashy, futuristic town with strobe lights and a somewhat dense population considering the size of the premises. It\u0027s not even that big, but it\u0027s... Out of place. Surrounded by desert, it stands as a beacon of light.\n\nYour mentor is garbed with the hoodie he gave you earlier, his older, but surly exterior showing out in the twilight. As he leads you through the sand to the City, he suddenly stops to speak; and you stand at attention.\n\n\"So, you\u0027re probably all ears to hear what my plan was.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Err, yes.\"\n\n\"Then why didn\u0027t you ask? Didn\u0027t my plan sound ridiculous\"\n\nThe wind stops blowing. \"I know you have everything under control. I trust in you, master.\"\n\nKelso turns to face you, his face solemn and grim.\n\n\"Then you\u0027re not what I need. I want to tame a lion, not a goat.\" He spits, and before you know it your face has hit the rough sand. You quickly turn to see Kelso jumping up, the moon behind him and his silver claws in front, his eyes now turned red and gleaming. You jump from the ground to the side, but his hand catches your chest. You breathe; it doesn\u0027t regenerate.\n\nAnother breath. More blood squirts out. His other hand now clawing at your eyes. Aching pain... it\u0027s all black, but you\u0027re still alive!\n\nYou can feel your body spasming, and you turn all your confusion into rage and power, but to no avail...\n\n\nYou have been killed by your mentor.\n",
  "page 16": "It\u0027s like the first time you remember Kelso. His hand outstretched, asking him to join you... But you don\u0027t.  Not this time. Even if you don\u0027t remember it, you were human, once, and you feel the need to repent for what you did. You need to find another way to survive, a way that doesn\u0027t include killing other humans.\n\n\"Get the armor on, it\u0027ll be necessary for what we need to do.\"\n\nCarefully, you nod to Kelso, and slowly begin to equip the poor Zealot\u0027s armor. It\u0027s heavy, though you find yourself easily wearing it over the hoodie, not hindering you mobility. You take a deep breath, putting on the stygian, metallic boots and gauntlets. You breathe out, terrified, though feigning submission. \"What do you want us to do? And why the lotion?\"\n\nKelso eyes you tentatively, \"The lotion is for the sun. It won\u0027t protect you for too long, but it\u0027ll protect you when it counts.\"\n\nMind racing, you prepare to run away from this sociopath. He may have saved your life, but he\u0027s not going to make you ruin others\u0027. With some clever positioning and a swift kick, the walkie-talkie on the floor flies at Kelso\u0027s face, taking him by surprise. It bounces-- and you catch reflexively, clipping it to your armor as intended and begin the run for your dear unlife. You can hear Kelso following you, cursing throughout, but you somehow manage to slow him down enough with old chairs and other platforms that you can make it out, ripping the door out of the frame in desperation and throwing it behind you. You quickly lather your face, the only uncovered part of your body, with the lotion. The sunrise-light hurts your eyes, but at the very least you can make out your surroundings-- all desert, save the city straight ahead. With one look back, you can see Kelso watching you from inside the house. His solemn grimace tells you that he doesn\u0027t expect you to survive after this, even if he doesn\u0027t follow you. But I\u0027ll show him. You realize that the only places you could go is either to the City, or to another half-buried building. Ugh, what should I do? Kelso said that the Church hates us, but I can\u0027t last hiding in a house for long...\n\nThe beating sun makes it hard to see clearly, but you notice the City, visible from ways away. The sunscreen won\u0027t hold up for as long as it takes me to reach there. I may want to find a place to stay before-- before...\n\nWith blood on your lips and the sun beating down on your head, you begin your road to redemption.\n",

Kelso has noted to you that he thinks you\u0027re ready, and you agree. Mostly.

  "page 200": "Even though you aren\u0027t sure whether you\u0027ll last, you decide that leaving for the City is the best idea. The heat continues to break through your facial protector, and you slowly begin feel your to rise in temperature.\n\nThe actual trek is simply unchanging; a barren landscape and a hot, disgusting atmosphere with a City that never seems to get any closer. Still, it beats being led by Kelso... \n\nTrying to take your mind off of the hear, you being to examine the animals which pass by: three passing spotted lizards, a flying creature too far away to describe, two snakes, you think you may have hear a wolf\u0027s howl...\n\nA raven-haired woman stands weeping in a white corridor while a man in a large lab coat seems to be trying to console her. Several more grim coated individuals walk past her in a hurry, ignoring her to the point of nearly knocking her over.\n\nOne of the doctors stops next to her to explain. As if reading off a script the doctor describes, \"We did everything we could have, I assure you... I\u0027m so, so sorry for your loss. If there\u0027s anything you need, the hospital staff can help.\"\n\nShe continues to wail.\n\nThe landscape changes, and you find yourself being carried on an uncomfortable metal cart. The pushing starts off light but quickly morphs to aggressive, and about five medical practitioners begin gawking at you while moving your bed. For whatever reason, the only thing you can focus on is breathing heavily, which continuously gives you a pinging feeling in your ribs.\n\nOne of them, in particular, beckons over you, his head-mirror sending a blinding glare so you can\u0027t profile him. His eyes... The only thing you can see with clarity aside from the frizzy blonde hair, show out a bright and penetrating red, staring at you with a certain hunger as he lets out a devastating cackle.\n\n\"This one will do. Bring him to the facility.\"\n\nYou suddenly break out of your trance. In front of you is an armored man with a quizzical expression, prodding at your breastplate with a pointed stick, \"You there, buddy, woken up yet? You\u0027ve been like this for maybe ten minutes already. Who are you?\"\n\nWith great effort, you reorient yourself with the surrounding area, the city gates, the guard in question, a blinding light from above...\n\nEverything turns to black.\n",
  "page 202": "\"Yes, I suppose it\u0027s pretty obvious, haha.\" Kelso remarks, now facing you again. His face has contorted into an ugly sneer, half of it hidden by a shadow. \"I am your Creator, Simon Kurschner.\"\n\nEverything I\u0027ve done until now... All of it... He\u0027s been stringing along...\n\nThe Professor continues, \"I suppose this may take a small while  to digest, so I suppose you should sit on the chair. Stein won\u0027t be needing it anymore.\"\n\nHe motions to a chair, but you remain sturdy. \"To be honest, I think I\u0027ll stand.\"\n\nHe shrugs, \"Where was I... Yes, to put it simply, you were my best-- no, most successful. Creation.\"\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" You snarl back at him, already retracting your claws. Taking over the City. That was part of his plan. Convincing the Wolves to take down the one faction powerful enough to oppose him... And I carried it out... As his messenger.\n\n\"Exactly what I said, immortal one. You aren\u0027t my strongest Creation, I imagine you realized that by now, but you\u0027re easily the most... adaptable, you see. You can live forever, you can spawn kin a lot more efficiently than any other monster I created. You are the perfect heir to carry on my work. I am old-- I imagine I shall die in several years. You were perfect-- you didn\u0027t remember anything of your past life, and as such I was able to mold you into a new, ahem, uh... a new being. You were the last Vampire I created, too, and the only one which survived Facility 13\u0027s destruction. I taught you what was necessary to your survival... Strength fueled by anger. Anger creates the determination which makes sure people who can carry out a mission.\" You notice a twinkle in his eye as he brings his face closer to yours. \"And you did it perfectly. You used your anger, ironically your anger for myself, to stop at nothing to gain the power to find me, and then you found a loving for your brethren, and those two bonds-- vengeance and brotherhood, is what gave you the power to take over an ENTIRE city filled with Zealots! Something I realized that I myself couldn\u0027t do. The other Creations wouldn\u0027t listen to me, but you! Oh you...\" He beams once again at you.\n\n\"And you expect me to just join you after all the lies? After you yourself bred me to hate you?\"\n\n\"Remember this, boy, I saved your life. I am your Creator, your father, not biological of course-- what I did was necessary, for you, so that you\u0027d have the drive to complete this task. Don\u0027t you see it? What we can do together?\"\n\nSeeing your resistance, he sighs, \"Now, it is your choice, my student. You can join me, use your resources here to help me rule the World and recreate it. Lay waste to the surviving civilizations still building themselves up from the Calamity of the past. They exist-- I have spent the past two years finding them, gathering information on them. Together, we can accomplish so many things, usher in a new age, larger and better than before! Bring life to this deserted plane, create a new world with us as its founders. I made sure-- none of the major Creations are left. You took care of Gideon, and Ragnor was killed too, of course. I made sure Stein was killed, and the rest were charred in the factory fires. You yourself were a major one, even though you conveniently forgot everything. The dynasty will continue with you, mattering on what you decide. Join me, so we can be Gods of the New World!\"\n\n\"Stein was one of your own Creations, and you KILLED him? What the hell is wrong with you?\"\n\n\"Shut it, fool.\" He snaps, reaching for your hand, as he did so long ago. \"Stein, Ragnor, and Gideon... They didn\u0027t understand, they couldn\u0027t. That\u0027s you were so perfect, You can make a fresh new start, and you can help me rebuild civilization from the start. I had to kill Stein, don\u0027t you see? He would have stopped me, like the rest of my disgusting monsters. You-- you\u0027re different though, right? You can fight for the greater good, I know you can... You have to.\"\n",
  "page 201": "Knowing that you couldn\u0027t possibly just show up on the doorstep of the Zealots, you begin to aimlessly wander through the desert in search of a residence. The beating sun will begin breaking through your sunscreen, and once that wears off your body will simply cook like an egg. Thankfully, it doesn\u0027t take too long before you find a complex and large assortment of wood-- oak, slanted on its side. The problem with most of the houses you found scattered in the deserted plane was that there was that the structures tended to extend quite far into the sand, and as such only give room for crawling. Of course, that isn\u0027t too bad and would be better than nothing, as it would mean you could avoid the sun during the day, at least, but it wouldn\u0027t be comfortable by any means. This particular one, however, seemed different.\n\nWith your hand you lightly brush off some of the sand on a particular window. You attempt to open it, but try as you might it doesn\u0027t budge.\n\nYou sigh, then take a deep breath before launching a powerful wallop at the window-- your punch simply creating a clean hole the shape of your gauntlet. You begin to slowly chip away at the hole until it is big enough for you to fit yourself through.\n\nOnce your squeeze yourself inside, you find a cozy little bedroom where almost everything is covered in sand and dust. With a sigh, you set yourself on a mound of sand.\n\nAfter a conscious debate, you decide to stay here for a small while. At least, until you figure out what you want to do from here. Of course, you can always try to leave for the City, which is only a night\u0027s walk away and hope they forgive you for what you did to the poor Zealot, or you can try to find a different way into it. Regardless, it\u0027s fairly obvious to you that you can\u0027t just live in the desert alone. You need sustenance, you need shelter, protection... And you want to find out more about the past. You\u0027ve combed the desert-- there\u0027s nothing out there in walk-able distance with your condition.\n\nWhat it comes down is that, if you want to discover more about civilization, the answers are more likely to be in the City than anywhere else. You hope that the number of days passed will have at least calmed the Zealots down. You figure that approaching them in the early morning would be a better idea. Passing out as you make your introduction would have been quite embarrassing.\n\nDeciding to leave it for later, however, proves to be a fatal mistake. As the night passes by your peaceful cabin, a sudden though familiar voice peers out of night and through the window.\n\n\"And you would have been so perfect, too... Just like me, you know...\"\n\n\nYou have been killed by Kelso, your would-be mentor.\n",
  "page 204": "\"Kelso, you can\u0027t just kill those you create!\" You say in disbelief. You gather your energies to send a heavy-fisted blow to his side-- it lands, but just barely.\n\nThe Professor grunts, whatever that is under his vest probably soaking in the hit. \"Just as the so-called God created and destroyed with the Flood, so will I! Only my plan is grander, oh, so much grander...\"\n\n\"You just want to kill everything that lives!\"\n\n\"Not everything, kid. Just the bipedal beings which have polluted the Earth with their repulsive beliefs. They are unneeded, they screwed up. We have the chance to make it right.\"\n\n\"Stop saying, \u0027we\u0027!\" You yell, ramming into him with your shoulder. The unexpected maneuver takes him by surprise, and you manage to pin the bastard onto the hot concrete. With another punch you send his head into the stone, making an audible thud. And yet, the bastard\u0027s eyes are still open.\n\nUsing his off-leg to lock yours in and his hand clutching at your shoulder, he pushes up with his pelvis and twists-- giving him initiative and a turn up on top. Before you can try to get back, he starts to cut at your face with an extremely sharp object, like a warm knife... Coming from his hand?\n\nStruggling ensues, and you find yourself evenly matched in terms of strength, but he seems to have managed to make his entire body a weapon-- literally. Not sure what else to do, you tuck your head in and bite into his neck, ripping through his flesh though not getting as much blood as you\u0027d hope...\n\n\"Ha! You think that I stopped when the Facilities were burnt down? I am my own experiment, thank you very much. You\u0027ve chosen unwisely, child. But now... You\u0027ve given up your chance in my world to come...\"\n\nJust shut up. You continue biting down until you just manage to rip out a chunk of his neck, only to spit it out.\n\nHe groans slightly and loosens the hold, just enough that your  kick sends him off of you and into the darkness again.\n\nYou get off to reorient yourself, and find a trail of pus and blood in the direction you kicked Kelso. Warily, you follow it, wondering if he might have finally been put to sleep. Thankfully, your senses notice an increase in pressure right in time. You duck-- feeling the air and limb pass over you, then send a counter-slash with your claws. It connects, and you feel yourself striking bone as Kelso is thrown over to the more lit side of the factory once more.\n\nSimon Kurschner begins laughing hysterically once more, and you notice that all of his wounds-- his neck, his ripped side-- it\u0027s all healed!\n\n\"You still don\u0027t get it.\" He states, getting up wth several coughs of blood, \"you cannot kill me. I taught you everything you know. I am your Creator, and you cannot reach the heights of your God just yet. It was a valiant effort on your part, but here is where things change.\"\n\nSuddenly, Kelso\u0027s body begins to change. His arms turn to large, fleshy scythes and his body in enlarging to different proportions. He snarls at you, readying himself for the next round.\n\n\"Foolish child. No matter what you do, I end up winning. Even if you kill me, it will only send you further on your downwards spiral into the darkness. You don\u0027t have a choice at this point, my influence will affect you no matter what you do!\"\n",
  "page 203": "\"Yes, master.\" You comply, giving him a short, though enunciated bow. The Professor beams at you.\n\n\"Excellent! We shall be going at once.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Everywhere. Bring your Ghouls, your loved one-- everything you own. For together, we will rule the Earth and create life anew!\"\n\n\nYou\u0027ll admit, that at the time he noted that you you didn\u0027t expect much from it. A lofty, exaggerated goal was what is seemed to be. And yet, here you are.\n\nThe world changed dramatically since that day. You found yourself at Kurschner\u0027s side, serving under him and doing his dirty work for him. You don\u0027t mind, however-- this is the man who gave you life. It is only fit that you pay back his kindness, with interest.\n\nThe first several days included a campaign to the South. On the way, you encountered the nomads-- those which you were searching for before the Professor picked you up. They fought valiantly, but your own Ghouls overcame them by sheer number. You noticed that the Ghouls enjoyed this, too. By now, they were converted to the same hate that you were brought up on.\n\nYou continued down the 40 miles, where you saw the fallen city. Buildings reduced to mere rubble, with no traces of humanity left. You continued several miles on, everyone in the party excited by the desolate city, where the pale corpses which were strewn about were devoured by the hungry citizens of Church-City.\n\nMiles ahead, you found more camps of humans, all of them toiling about, working. On the Professor command, you ghouled each and every last one of them, your army growing substantially. The screams of the children mean nothing to you, and the foolish men who try to oppose you are only a more satisfying feed. And this continued for year, until you really did conquer the continent. From there your army was large enough to split and conquered from the East to the West, South to North and throughout the entire visible landscape. Your surroundings changed, you found greenery and you found life, but they were all yours to conquer and overtake. Some of your army die, like your closest colleagues end up, but you delude yourself by saying to your blind followers, \"They died a warrior\u0027s death. Carry on.\"\n\nIt doesn\u0027t matter that even a fool such as you can see through the vanity of your own words, you have just come to not care. Your army of barbarians mean the end of mankind, and you recognize, after a while, that there isn\u0027t anything more to do.\n\nEven after the Professor\u0027s death, you remain just a servant to his ideals and goals. In fact, you barely notice his absence; his voice still whispering in your ear to this day. You\u0027re his ghoul for eternity, and that has become your persona. That is what you accomplished in your unlife. You rule the Earth, but you\u0027re not the ruler of yourself. You find yourself lost in the sea of madness, and, with every living source finally depleted, get the honor of witnessing your barbaric tribes turn on each other for feed. As the End of Days nears, and you recognize that Simon Kurschner, Kelso, had his wish fulfilled. The world will be forced to evolve on its own again, without humans or monsters to ruin it. A fresh start, without prejudice and without strife, all natural.\n\n\nAnd for your heroic actions, you were rewarded with marching across the desert alone, for an an eternity; until God himself had to come to take you away.\n",
  "page 206": "You\u0027ve prepared for this very moment for a while now, even if you never expected it to be your mentor whom was the infamous Professor. Nevertheless, you ready your claws and let out a roar, your sharp teeth bared. You position yourself in front of Kelso, and you find your staring match being broken by the sound of a collapsing building.\n\n\"This makeshift factory is crumbling as we speak, Vampire. Leave now and we shall both live.\" Kelso seethes, moving toward you with his scythe-arms.\n\n\"I really couldn\u0027t care less, Kelso. If I die, you\u0027re coming with me to the pits of Gehhena.\"\n\n\"So shall it be.\" He states, before running at you.\n\nWith a swift duck, his skin-scythe barely misses you, but allows you to send a powerful knee at his abdomen, and then a follow-up slash. Your claws rip against his face, leaving marks that don\u0027t leave so quickly. You don\u0027t let it finish there, however, and push him back several feet so you could recover.\n\nThe beast growls, and as he does so several of the metal machines begin to hiss and make odd noises, while the pillars begin to shake.\n\nSeeing as how Kelso is willing to wait it out, you charge in with a leap, twisting in midair to land on a pillar\u0027s side-- kick at it to get momentum and send a forceful grab at the Professor\u0027s eye with your claws. Your Creator howls, not expecting that specific attack, and punches at you with his scythe arm, the other changed into a real hand to shirk you off.\n\nHis knife stabs into your back, and looking down you can see it coming out of your stomach-- and yet you hold onto your clutch on his eye.\n\nAs he roars, you roar back, enraged by all the things this bastard has done to you. David, Gideon, Ragnor, the rest... And now Nordim!\n\n\"You killed them all you bloody bastard!\" With an angry yank, you rip out his left eye, several bloody strands coming out with it. This time, the blood is real, and it squirts out at you as the half-blind scientist throws you at another pillar, causing another one to break while he covers his brand new hole. \"There\u0027s more where that came from, you genocidal freak...\" You mutter, lunging at him once more.\n\nThis time though. he readies himself, , and brings down both of his arms to slam you downwards. His strike sends you flying down to the floor. As you turn to your side to look upwards, you find the Professor looming over you, \"Such a shame... Good night Vampi--\" \n\nAt the moment, the building collapses on itself completely.\n\nAs the dust clears up, you find a bleeding Kurschner laughing, slowly getting up. By now his face is disfigured further his remaining eye to puffy to be of any use. \"So, you\u0027ll be killing me now?\"\n\n\"No, that\u0027d be too kind. I came all of this way just to find you to make sure you don\u0027t continue your experiments, but now that I have you in my grasp...\" You walk over to his naked figure, and begin to apply pressure to his neck, \"I think that death isn\u0027t fit for what you did to this world. I have other plans for you...\"\n",

  "page 33": "You push the button on the walkie-talkie, and speak into it. \"Hello?\"\n\nMoments pass. After several more crackles you get a response. A cool female voice speaks out, \"Sebastian? Seargent, is everything alright?\" British?\n\nKelso shoots you a sideways glance. You can almost feel him sending you a message with his eyes. Be creative, you call the shots for now.\n\nYou blink. Ahem, \"I have spotted some of the err, creations.\"\n\n\"Well of course you have.\" Matter of fact tone. \"We\u0027ve known where the devils that are the Wolves have been for a while now. We just need to strike them. Which reminds me, we should get back to base.\"\n\nPerfect. Ish. \"No! The, uh, lord helped me and I found others.\"\n\n\"Others? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"There are other Creations that have escaped aside from the, uh, wolves, and-\"\n\nThe woman on the other side is excited, \"More?\"\n\n\"Um, only one. That I found, at least. But one is one too many. I uh, need backup.\"\n\n\"Stop stuttering, Sebastian. This is important. Where are you? Now searching it up...\" Pause. \"Your GPS tracker hasn\u0027t been functioning for a couple of days. That\u0027s probably why security has tightened around the City. Where the hell are you?\"\n\nShit. \"Well, uh, the battery died and, uh, things happened.\"\n\n\"Things? Sebastian, I... Did it take you hostage?\"\n\nYou\u0027ve decided you like her voice. \"It?\"\n\nShe lowers her voice, \"What is your general location, Sebastian? We\u0027ll find you. You\u0027ll be safe.\"\n\nYou pause, looking to Kelso for help. To tell the truth, you have no idea where you are. Kelso looks the other way. You sigh, annoyed at him. Maybe he\u0027s just a bit offended that your plan was better. Or not.\n\n\"I...\"\n",
  "page 208": "This time, you laugh back at him. \"Don\u0027t think you\u0027ll get off that easy, Kelso. You and I... We\u0027ll have a lot more in common very soon.\"\n\nThe half-blinded freak of nature stares at you blankly as you release your grip around its throat. It falls on its knees, pitifully looking up at you in confusion.\n\n\"No,\" you state, as if to answer a question, \"I\u0027m not killing you. But I\u0027m not letting you live either.\"\n\nKelso\u0027s eyes widen as he begins to struggle once more, but your hand reaffirm a hold on him, and you sink your teeth into his jugular, and slowly begin to drain the bastard of his life-source. The blood is absolutely horrid, tasting like vinegar in comparison to the good wine of regular blood, but the crimson juice tastes satisfying nonetheless. This is the first time a scream of pain has given you a feeling of such grandeur.\n\n\nFrom that day on Simon Kurschner became your right-hand Ghoul, as many much greater men had served before him. As a slave, he unwittingly works off the unlimited hours that are the worth of the people he caused you to harm, the countless lives he affected negatively. It marks something very important about your reign back Home as well; you are vicious, cunning, and efficient.\n\nYour Ghoul army, now with influence spanning the entire sandy globe, started out small, but soon began growing and conquering nearby regions. Human survivors hundreds of miles away came to try to stop the advancement of your forces, only to find themselves outnumbered and outmatched. Eventually they tried to set up peace-terms, but, seeing how you have no reason to comply, simply continued to wage wars with them, enslaving the survivors to help your civilization grow.\n\nHowever, as time passes, you find your heavily interconnected race of sentient gods-on-Earth begin to fight and form their own factions under your nose. They begin warring with each other as children might, over the small things like territory and generation-- because apparently the amount of time elapsed since they were ghouled is an important landmark.\n\nYou\u0027ve come to disregard it, for it all seems like nonsense. Regardless of what the ridiculous things they squabble over, for they all report back to you. \u0027Vampire Lord\u0027 is what the majority of the world has come to title you, and it has come to grow on you. You are the Ruler of the One Continent, the single, immense desert that has dominated the wasteland, and you are the king of it all.\n\nUnexpectedly, perhaps, perhaps half a century later, where you and your wife spend your days in the palace built in your honor, you find a large faction of Ghouls who have decided you are unfit to be the Overlord. 1st generation Ghouls, the most troublesome lot, have led the charge. The name of their leader is something... with a Z. You simply cannot recall.\n\nThe revolt was put down in one night.\n\nCountless years go by, where you find yourself alone and impoverished, for your Ghouls ran rampant within dependence and found ways to kill themselves off. Your wife\u0027s brittle hands attempt to hold you down, telling you not to engage the final monster, the last being still alive on this plane. \"But no, my love, my time is for nothing if I don\u0027t challenge Him. If I am ruler of this Earth, what have I to fear?\"\n\n\nYou assure your wife of your survival, and embrace the One outside. The planet surrounding you has become a crystalline wonderland in man\u0027s absence, beautifully empty and smooth. No matter how hard you fight, you find yourself taking your seat among the stars, just like everybody else.\n",
  "page 32": "It must be twilight by now... It\u0027s dark in the collection of sand-dunes, with several pillars of stone in the area, but the nearly full moon help your eyes adapt to the situation. You sit beside Kelso in a lotus position, waiting eagerly to here what he wants to say.\n\n\nWhile we  may need to recognize our inner animal in order to fight, we need to also need to see what we actually are. Our limitations, our skills, both inherent and learnt.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, what are your main assets?\n\nMy claws and fangs?\n\nPerhaps. What about your regeneration capabilities?\n\nOh, uh, right.\n\nThis is for you, not for me, kid. Use your newfound abilities wisely, and avoid situations where certain things won\u0027t help.\n\nLike, my regeneration won\u0027t save me after my head is blown off, right?\n\nErr, yes. But it will regenerate most limbs back, provided they hadn\u0027t been burnt to a stub. The body is interesting like that.\n\nSo basically I should stay away from explosions.\n\nIndeed. We should tread carefully whenever dealing with the C.E. They no doubt have heavy-weaponry. But you should find out more about your abilities as time progresses, fairly certain your new genes are still stretching.\n\nI\u0027m not really sure what that means...\n\nNeither do I, haha!\n",
  "page 207": "With your fingers deeply entrenched into his neck, it takes a little more than a pull to finally killing him.\n\nAnd then it\u0027s over. All of it. The Professor is dead.\n\nOr so you think.\n\nThe week after, when every thing was explained and settled with your people, you and Cecilia began to reform your policies. Kelso admitted that there were several surviving strongholds somewhere in the desert. And now, with the Professor dead, you have no other priorities stopping you and your nation from conquering this Earth. It doesn\u0027t take long for you to mobilize your armies to search out and destroy any and all colonies they find, coming back and reporting to you immediately after.\n\nOne time, a sizeable group-- eighteen ghouls, don\u0027t return from a two hundred mile journey from home, though in actuality only a seventy-two mile trip due to the colonization of a a large row of identical rotting buildings. Neither does the next, smaller group you send after them.\n\nEventually, you decide that it is worth your attention enough to seek out yourself. With Cecilia by your side and ten Ghouls, you leave Home and begin a tedious trek through the desert to find the specific route the Ghouls disappeared at. The desert, crawling with various lizards and a single cactus, slowly reveals the effect of your colonizing. It isn\u0027t too amazing, but it seems that the sand is reacting to the unlife now living above it. You stop at one of the rotting houses, where the ghouls-- whom you don\u0027t really remember ghouling very well, treat you like a king. You stock up on desert-lizard blood, which tastes bland but at the very least gives you enough nutrition for a week per vial.\n\nYou leave contented, while the immigrants bow to your leave, crying out, \"Hail Lord of the Undead, Ruler of the Earth!\"\n\nYou and your team continue walking through the hot-desert, thanking the deities that your hood and mask have made it more bearable to do so by day. Ten miles, fifteen, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty-eight, seventy-two...\n\nSuddenly, you sense something odd. A smell... Something burnt, and it\u0027s coming your way--\n\nYou instinctively duck, and a large shell flies above you and into a Ghoul, exploding only after it slams into him. The explosion is fierce, and you find everybody but Cecilia, in wolf-form, on the ground to recover. Your vision clears up, and you find an approaching figure, cloaked with camo-patterned garbs and holding a large green pipe, pointing it in your direction.\n\n\"We were waiting for you to come. Vampire.\" The figure states, taking off his mask with his off-hand. You don\u0027t recognize the man, and you can\u0027t seem to place a finger on where his ancestry is from.\n\n\"Who are you?\" You yell back, readying your claws to fight.\n\n\"The Last of the Zealots. You\u0027re not getting away with your barbarism, demon. I\u0027m glad you came, though, because this is how we wanted to declare our war on you.\"\n\n\"Where did you come from?\"\n\n\"We\u0027ve been rebuilding for years now, since Father Tomas sent us out in the case of emergency. And, well, when rumors of the \u0027Fearsome Vampire Lord\u0027 spread through this desert, we realized this was fate that God planned out. You... You killed our parents, and now we have the chance to kill you!\"\n\n\"Fool!\" You seethe, running past Cecilia as the Zealot loads his weapon again to shoot, \"The Ghouls are much more numerous and much more powerful than you humans, you stand no chance!\"\n\nHe laughs before shooting his bazooka again at you-- he misses once again, only hurting more of your ghouls. A moment later, his vocal chords are slashed out in a blood squirt, you happily savoring the blood.\n\n\"Vamp, there\u0027s... There\u0027s two hundred Zealots coming this way!\" Cecilia shouts from behind you pointing at maybe half of that, fully armed Zealots less than a mile down. Once they notice us...\n\nYou turn back, surveying the situation-- All but one Ghoul is badly injured, their limbs maimed to the point of crippling. What can we do?\n\n\"You, healthy one, get up, run, and save yourself! Warn the rest of the Ghouls to prepare for battle, and stay low until you\u0027re out of their range.\"\n\nHe nods and leaves, running in the direction you came from. \"Vamp... What are we doing then?\" Cecilia asks, fear in her large canine eyes.\n\n\"We... We can\u0027t just leave our Ghouls her to die. Maybe... Ugh, God... Cecilia, can you dig?\"\n\nShe nods, understanding-- if she can make a burrow that can fit you all, you can at least survive until they pass. As it is now, they can overtake you with the distance of their weapons if they notice you running away now. Cecilia begins to dig, using her powerful claws to sift through the dirt. Minutes pass, and you look behind your shoulder...\n\nThey see you. You\u0027re in range.\n\nYou wake up in a dark chasm, feeling little, if any pain. \"Ce-Cecilia?\" You call out into the darkness.\n\n\"I\u0027m here, love.\"\n\n\"What... Happened?\"\n\n\"We were hit.\"\n\n\"Hit?\"\n\n\"You, especially. It\u0027ll take time to heal.\"\n\nWith great effort, you bring your head up. Your body seems to be stuck in the sand. Why... You struggle, angrily waving your arms around. Sand pours onto your face, and with a solid yank, you pull out a stubby  forearm. No hand.\n\n\"Ahh!\"\n\n\"Relax, dear. It will... heal. In time.\" She brings her face in front of yours and frowns. \"I don\u0027t know if you remember, but...\"\n\n\"But what? How did this happen?\"\n\n\"The shell struck you directly. Thank God for your armor, but... It took away several of your appendages. I couldn\u0027t fit all the Ghouls in the hole I made, so I fit you in there right before they came to finish off the job. We\u0027ve been hiding here since.\"\n\n\"How long has it been?\"\n\n\"I\u0027ve counted a month, Vamp. It\u0027s taken a while, but your limbs are restoring themselves.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath. \"Do you know what became of the war?\"\n\n\"The Ghouls and the remaining Humans slaughtered each-other mercilessly until nothing was left. Every we\u0027ve worked for, it\u0027s gone.\"\n\n\"Show me the outside.\"\n\n\"Nothing is left, I told you.\"\n\n\"Show me the outside, Cecilia. Please.\"\n\nSlowly, she complies. With delicate handiwork, she carves out your other stub, and one of your bloody thighs, missing the leg. She carries your corpse to a wall of sand, pokes a hole in it and puts your eye to it. \"See? We can\u0027t even see an outline of the City from here.\"\n\n\"Open it up a little more, love.\"\n\nShe does so, opening up the door and allowing light to completely dominate the chasm.\n\nYou view the desolate terrain with a weak smile, \"So, this is what\u0027s left?\"\n\n\"Yeah. The Ghouls wouldn\u0027t survive after such a heavy onslaught from the Last Zealots, and as such they took everything they had to kill the Zealots. Both sides succeeded.\"\n\n\"You think there are any humans left that know of us?\"\n\nCecilia smiles, though only half of her face has enough skin to show it, \"Definitely. I\u0027d be surprised if the tale of the Assault on Church-City isn\u0027t a horror story for children on the other side of this desert-planet.\" She puts you down, and you situate yourself to sit in front of the view. \"Crazy, isn\u0027t it?\"\n\n\"That what?\"\n\n\"That the sun is so big today. It\u0027s been growing.\"\n\n\"Vampy... Are you feeling alright?\"\n\n\"See... I killed all those who wronged me, in the end. Then it turned out that even my beloved mentor wronged me, and now there is nobody in the end, haha.\"\n\n\"There\u0027s you and me left.\" She states, sitting down next to you. Even with have of her body charred, she still brightens your day further.\n\n\"You know, it really is beautiful. The desert.\"\n\n\"You\u0027re right.\"\n",
  "page 35": "Scared to risk stuttering more and screwing things up, you take the WT and make sure Kelso holds it. He looks at you with contempt before speaking into it.\n\n\"Indeed.\" He seethes, his voice threatening and just... Cold. Kelso doesn\u0027t even need to try to get his voice that way, it just is, even if it sounds grandfather-like when he scolds you, \"I have him. It\u0027s amazing how the Church has destroyed what\u0027s left of this Earth. Only desert left aside from your little colony and houses buried in sand. But believe me, this \u0027Sebastian\u0027 isn\u0027t the first human who I\u0027ve caught.\" Kelso pauses, and releases the button to see if she responds.\n\nShe doesn\u0027t.\n\nHe finishes. \"And he won\u0027t be the last.\"\n\nClick\n\nAnd it\u0027s off.\n\n\"Master, wasn\u0027t that too dramatic? We don\u0027t want them to send more than we can handle...\"\n\n\"Kid, you never force a person into a conversation he didn\u0027t start. You\u0027d think you\u0027d still remember proper manners. Let\u0027s just hope to heaven they don\u0027t bring every damn one of the king\u0027s men.\"\n\n---\n\nKelso and yourself find several mounds to hide behind. There are only several clusters of areas around the big City that have the half-buried houses, which means that the religious troupe will likely find them there, at some point. You keep your sights on the city. Every once in a while you\u0027ll see moving lights across the landscape, which are subsequently turned off. Then on. And off again...\n\n\"Those are the soldiers.\" Kelso points out to you. A good deal of them too, and approaching quickly on more than one side. The lights seem to travel in groups. You count... Eight groups of five. You wonder how many you can take, and in turn how much more Kelso could.\n\n\"So, what\u0027s the plan?\"\n\n\"We capture one and hightail it out of here. This... Is going to be challenging.\"\n\nYour mentor stands up, watching the approaching mob of Zealots. Two or three are way off, lighting up the opposite direction, but the rest are surrounding your vicinity, though you\u0027re uncertain if that\u0027s on purpose or not. Kelso motions you to come closer to him, to listen. \"This is where we split up. They\u0027re trying to flank us, but that won\u0027t work when they\u0027re spread out like this. We\u0027re, funnily enough, a straight, though long line away from the city. The lights are moving toward us, and with other groups closing in from the two sides; a circle. I go one way, you go the other.\"\n\n\"Like we trained, I hit hared and fast.\"\n\nHe nods. \"Let\u0027s get to it then. Good luck, kid.\" He begins jogging to the left. It\u0027s when he breaks out into a run when you only begin moving leftwards. For the first time since you escaped the Facility, you\u0027re scared. You sprint across the sand with your head down, maintaining balance and stealth even with your heavy armor. You ready yourself, the lights shining brighter and brighter until... You see them. Tall, thick, dark; the words that come to mind. Shining Crosses on ebony metal that covers the entire body, down to the legs. His helmet\u0027s visor is like a medieval knight\u0027s, only more techy. Not only that, but their rifles are huge, with tusks at the end. You wonder what caliber that behemoth could hold...\n\nStill, you have the element of surprise, if only because you aren\u0027t a lightbulb shaped a like freaking cross.\n\nYou leap up, letting a gust of wind propel you, making a cross of your own in the night-sky, Your body finds itself right above the ringleader, who dumbly looks up when your feet, disguised as sneakers, land on his  helmet. A heavy clunking sound is made before you hear a snap (his neck), which you use for momentum, jumping at another, this time with your fists. Refined rage, like Kelso taught you.\n\nIt was going fine until bullets came into the picture. After the second clunk the last three of the group turn and point their bayonets-on-crack rifles at you. What comes out isn\u0027t a bullet, more like... Lightning?\n\nIt bursts out at you with a mighty roar, and you feel your skin ripping, only to regenerate. Three more blasts, you make another swipe, hitting viciously through the armor of one, finishing him off with blood. Three (who were shooting at you) to go.\n\nThey reload, which thankfully takes enough time. One of them doesn\u0027t bother, however, and stick the tusks of his rifle into you. Some of your blood spills, and even more of his bursts out when you push his rifle from inside you to inside of him, his armor nothing when your rage takes over. With blood squirting into your eyes, the rest are easy work. You claw at the armored figures, their lightning-shots hurting you but not overcoming you until... You\u0027re done. Five of them were killed, and you don\u0027t even remember how the last one went down. You lay on the sand, too stunned to move.\n\nMore of the Crosses come over to belt you over the head with what must be a bible, because damn was it heavy.\n\n---\n\nEven more bright lights (a recurring theme, you tell yourself), and you find yourself strapped onto a chair. The room is all blue, but your chair is white. For whatever reason, the colors seem pleasant, and calming to you. You wonder what happened to Kelso...\n\nA powerful voice speaks out, \"Who are you?\"\n",
  "page 34": "You continue waiting. Time turns to an entire hour forward, and Kelso is getting antsy...\n\nCrackling. \"Sebastian? Sebastian, where are you?\"\n\nThe sudden noise surprises you and  you let out a sharp, \"Ahh!\", which makes Kelso sigh loudly. Thankfully, they can\u0027t hear you unless you press the button to speak.\n\nThe voice repeats itself. You recognize it as female, cool and British.\n\n\"H-hello?\"\n\n\"Sebastian! Thank the lord you\u0027re safe! We haven\u0027t been able to contact you for days!\"\n\n\"Wh-why is that?\" You stutter out, trying to mimic what you remember of the Zealot\u0027s voice best you can.\n\n\"GPS-tracker stopped responding a couple of days ago. I only saw this now, but that\u0027s probably why security has tightened around the City. Where are you? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"I, uh, yes, I am.\" You try to think of a way to get some soldiers here. \"I found another Creation.\"\n\n\"Another one? Like, one that isn\u0027t part of the Wolves?\"\n\nHer voice sounds nice, you decide. \"Yeah, different.\"\n\n\"Have you made contact with the demon yet?\"\n\n\"Um, no, but I need back-up.\"\n\n\"Wait, what happened? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Of course. I just... We need to catch these guys, don\u0027t we?\"\n\nShe seems agitated as well as worried, \"We don\u0027t tackle on Creations alone, weren\u0027t you briefed?\"\n\nYou try your best to pull this off, \"Listen I... Just need back-up.\"\n\nShe pauses, \"Are you... Captured? Sebastian, where the hell are you!\"\n\nNailed it.\n",
  "page 209": "\"No, this is where you don\u0027t win. I know you want me to kill you, to finish my contract with you. To become a killer and to not have a path to return to. But no... If there\u0027s one thing I learnt from my experience in this realm, it\u0027s that somewhere beneath all the hatred you bred into me, there lies somebody who can care about others. It\u0027s crazy and it sounds funny, but it\u0027s true. There\u0027s good beneath the worst people, and even if redemption isn\u0027t a possibility for you, that doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t for me, Kelso. I screwed up. Even if it was influenced by you, it doesn\u0027t change that I made the choice to overtake the City. My screw-up, and countless of people were killed due to me...\"\n\n\"And yet,\" you continue, \"my life isn\u0027t over. As you said, I will be living for a long while longer, and perhaps I\u0027ll be able to rebuild humanity. Not by destroying it, like you want me to, but by helping others, making it a point that revenge isn\u0027t the way to settle a score. What you did to me wasn\u0027t a blessing, it was a horrible curse that I will have to endure for eternity. But, deep inside of me I realize that I wanted to do good, little bits of me recognized right from wrong in my journey here. I cared about someone, my gut instincts were benevolent and yet I went against them. I was corrupted, and I... I have to purify myself. And that I shall, Kelso, that I shall.\"\n\nAfter a pause, you release Kelso from your grip. He falls down to the floor, gaping at you in shock. You smile back weakly, and lend out your hand to him.\n\n---\n\nThey say that our purpose on this earth is to learn from our mistakes so that we can help the world become a better place. Others say we have no purpose at all, and all is null and void at the end.\n\nBut you made your own destiny. A tradition of kindness spreads through the earth as your army of Ghouls begin to discover hidden societies forming hundreds of miles away. Across the never-ending desert, humanity soon picks itself up from the ground.\n\nIndeed, you are known throughout the world as the Vampire Lord, though feared as a creature of extraordinary influence and power, are also known to be the harbinger of peace between the tribal humans that poked their heads out of their holes, to create new civilizations.\n\nYou outlast all of your peers, even Cecilia, and witness the Earth\u0027s rebirth. However, even throughout the storm that is time, you never find yourself alone. Your fallen comrades remain in your soul, urging you to continue living and loving, giving hope to those who don\u0027t deserve it and single-handedly punishing  those who start their petty wars in the dirt.\n\nEffectively, you have become a God on Earth. Indeed, this is what became of your identity: a humane and benevolent persona with which you hold onto for eternity.\n\nAnd yet, when the fateful day came and Apollo arrived for your soul-- you don\u0027t even struggle. Your ending is of bliss.\n",
  "page 37": "\"I honestly don\u0027t know.\" You reply to the voice, \"But who are you?\"\n\nThe blue room begins to make funny, scratching noises. Then, the sound of clinking; gears shifting, and a part of the room turns backwards, revealing an opening. Out of it, and elderly man with a flowing white beard, skullcap and robe comes out. \"My apologies,\" His gravely, but strong voice speaks out, \"I am the founder of the Church and retired Zealot.\" As he says this, a hatch in the floor is cranked open, allowing space for an odd chair to form out. \"May I take a seat?\"\n\nYou lick your lips. Still some blood on them, you would have thought the assholes be kind enough to wash you, but apparently not. Seeing you not respond, the Father takes a seat. \"So,\" He begins, \"You don\u0027t remember... Anything? How have you been surviving alone? You\u0027re young.\"\n\nYou nod. \"No. I woke up when your \u0027Zealots\u0027 destroyed teh Facility. I\u0027m lucky I made it out alive, with your dogs burning it down. I had a mentor, though you likely got him as well...\"\n\n\"There are two unlisted Creations? Fascinating.\" He strokes his beard, \"The burning of the facility was necessary. Not that you\u0027d know, you\u0027re in the dark, I believe.\"\n\nYou find this funny, though not untrue. \"And you\u0027re about to enlighten me?\"\n\nTomas nods, \"Then end your suffering, through any means necessary.\"\n\n\"So I\u0027m going to die by the end of this?\"\n\n\"Of course. Though there\u0027s always the option of cooperating. Even the saints needed the devils to do their bidding. Sometimes.\" He smiles.\n\n\"I\u0027m not some sort of \u0027devil\u0027.\" You reply, bewildered, \"Why do you suppose that?\"\n\n\"You like stories, yes? Because there is a necessary one here, one that you probably never heard of.\"\n\nHead shaking, you motion for him to carry on.\n\n\"For being such a good sport, I\u0027ll cut out the dramatic parts and just get to the real \u0027beef\u0027\" He states, his eyes trained on yours. He coughs, spewing out dots of mucus in your direction, then does it again. WIth his throat now cleared, Father Tomas begins his tale.\n\n\"The world two decades ago was a much different place. Lush greens were the equivalent of sand today; everywhere you looked, there was grass. Huge cities, several miles in circumference, were common place. Buildings reaching the clouds and mods of transport like griffons, soaring high above. Religion, ironically, was considerably less widespread, and it continued to dwindle as so-called \u0027science\u0027 led many astray. As evil was legalized, sodomy and murder-rates soon became more and more consistent and the government fell to anarchy as horrible diseases began to spread. Militant radicals spread throughout the globe, raping and pillaging. At the time, to those who were looking, it was obvious that this was God\u0027s Reckoning; his flood to bring about a New Age. That\u0027s where Simon Kurschner\u0027s Creations came into play. With government support, he tried to find a way to get out of the apocalypse, not realizing it was God\u0027s will, it couldn\u0027t be stopped. But he tried, and he received the funding to do whatever he wanted, with hopes of stopping the plague, and creating beings who could stop the barbarians. He took the dead and dying, experimenting on them and trying to create slaves. There is no doubt in my mind he did things that weren\u0027t legal, but that didn\u0027t matter to them. As long as he saved us, he could go against the Lord\u0027s will, using humans as guinea pigs, and secretly trying to make for himself perfect slaves. Kurschner created many different sorts of entities, and for the next several years he was a beacon of hope for the non-believers. But we, the Church, we knew what was coming. The Creations were immune to disease, and had a fighting prowess unmatched by the strongest armies in the world. One Creation could destroy hundreds of Radicals with minimal effort, and it seemed like this would fix everything, but hell on Earth stayed. Even after the threats were stopped, the Creations and their Leader wanted more. They began to kill indiscriminately, with an attempt to rule the world.\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath, trying to remember, \"As God decreed, the Earth began to decay in the demons\u0027 wake. While Doctor Kurschner ruled his legions from hell, a few of us banded together. The Church was the new Ark; we banded together to maintain what\u0027s left of humanity. IT was hard, but we suceeded, with several towns in the Northern United States. But the demons still linger, and it is our duty to destroy what God intended to not let live.\n\n\"Because that\u0027s is what you are!\" He raises his voice, shaking his fists angrily at your helpless self on the chair, \"You were supposed to stay dead, like the rest of the infected. But you were given life, and now are doomed to live a cursed life because of that Doctor. That is why the Church will destroy all the Creations that are still roaming the Earth.\"\n\n\"But they\u0027re still human!\" You interrupt, pointing to yourself, \"I\u0027m still human.\"\n\nThe Priest continues, as if not hearing you, \"However... It isn\u0027t your fault. Perhaps that\u0027s why I\u0027m giving you this chance, a chance at a redemption, of sorts. After the men you\u0027ve killed, there is nothing I can do to save your unlife, but perhaps you can still find favor with the Lord... Undercover.\"\n",
  "page 36": "You lower your voice, \"I... not sure. We\u0027re in some sort of house. Lots of sand.\"\n\nNo reply. You click it off.\n\nKelso nods in seeming approval. \"It\u0027ll do. Let\u0027s just hope they underestimate one Creation and send only a couple soldiers. They are tasked to deal with the unknown. I got lucky with \u0027Sebastian\u0027; the foolish Zealot wandered out alone.\"\n\n---\n\nYour mentor and youself make your way to a particularly large sand-dune near the house, watching for incoming Zealots from the city ahead.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t too long-- after several minutes you begin to notice flashing armors marching in the moonlight. Your house is a surprisingly straight line to the city, and you notice some lights, formed in clusters, moving straight in your direction. Others seem to be coming in on a flank, moving to the left and right of the city before circling in, near your location. None are too close though, which gives time for Kelso to count them all.\n\n\"Five groups of five in all, with the Church having only a slight notion where we are and us having the element of surprise.\"\n\n\"You think that\u0027s good odds? From what it seems, they likely no more about what we can do then what we know they can.\"\n\n\"Not we, you. I fought Zealots before the facility was destroyed, you know. Even if they\u0027ve grown considerably, they\u0027re still the fear-mongering, symbolic fools as ever. With enough force their armor can be clawed through, only thing you have to worry about is silver and their lightning rifles.\"\n\n\"Sounds fun.\" You chuckles out nervously, \"Silver bullets and lightning rifles?\"\n\n\"Ah yes, silver is specifically harmful to us, for whatever reason. It is very pure... and the only thing that will stop us from regenerating, thankfully though, I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve caught on to that just yet. The shock-troops they send in are equipped with monstrous bayonets that shoot out streams of electrons at high velocity, which are scarily painful...\" He notices your frown, and smiles in return, \"But it\u0027s healable. And I think we can do it.\"\n\nYou nod, \"Not if their flanks succeeds. We need to either split up and fight the ones coming on the side or take the clusters on together.\"\n\n\"No question, we should fight together. Splitting up may make this go faster and more efficiently, but it\u0027s dangerous enough that it won\u0027t be worth it. Together, we can capture one of them as well as efficiently annihilate the groups one by one.\"\n\nYou nod back, assured. Kelso may retain information, but he\u0027s never lied to you. You think.\n\nThis brings your mind back to the incoming horde of Zealots,  which are less than a mile away by now, marching tirelessly, not exactly in your direction, but close enough...\n\n\"So, who do you think we should take on first?\"\n",
  "page 38": "\"A heathen, no doubt.\" You manage to spit out, angrily.\n\n\"Not a heathen, an abomination. There is a difference.\" The voice is male, and older. \"But I don\u0027t wish to quell your anger, as you are no doubt misguided. Worry not, we shall end your suffering.\"\n\n\"Thanks, I wouldn\u0027t want to be a burden.\"\n\nHe laughs. \"You are a funny devil alright, but one who deserves an explanation, if he wants one.\" Gears grind, causing your ears to sting while a shaft opens up in the blue room. An old man in a priestly garb and a skullcap comes out, an inviting though intimidating aura around him. \"Do you wish to know why you\u0027re here? What the Church\u0027s mission is?\"\n\nYou stare at the man. \"What\u0027s the point if you\u0027re just going to kill me right after?\"\n\n\"Us antagonists like our monologs, do we not? You\u0027d know, for I am only part of the lesser evil. So, if you please, allow me to explain why the verdict is so grim for one with such oratory abilities, like yourself.\"\n\nYou nod to the bizarre old man, \"Sure... But not before you tell me where my mentor is.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Kelso.\"\n\n\"Doesn\u0027t ring any bells. Can we go on?\" He says, looking at his watch.\n\nHe\u0027s not even wearing a watch! You sigh, \"You really want to tell me the story then, huh.\"\n\nThe pruned holy-man beams, \"Why yes!\"\n\nA long pause erupts. And you wait for the priest to tell you. He begins to cough, and cough... By now you\u0027re just irked, stuck in a room with a senile wackjob. It\u0027s surprising that he\u0027s your interrogator. \"So.\"\n\n\"Ah yes. On the first day,\" His large dark eyes twinkle, \"of the new Era, the world began to sink. Horrible diseases and militant radicals swept through different parts of the globe. Coincidentally, this all began after marriage became void and immorality was embraced.\" He shakes his head, \"Regardless, Simon Kurschner created his Program, with the government\u0027s support, and using the dead and dying as test subjects, he claimed that he wished to stop disease and create perfect soldiers as well. At the time, it sounded ludicrous; like a comic book. But the world governments were desperate, and he received the funding. The second day was much darker, with the disease spreading rapidly before Kurschner\u0027s lab was even finished. By the time it was done, he petitioned for less regulation, and that\u0027s when it began. There would be no stopping what he began to create. Worse than the viruses which wiped out humanity; a God\u0027s flood. This... you, are different, unnatural. Third day came and Simon sent a crew of his deathless zombies, which survived the disease under his care, to deal with military conflicts all over the world. The fact that it succeeded so well was a curse, as he gained more support. By the 4rth day he had thousands of Creations under his disposal. And who didn\u0027t trust him? The religious, the so-called \u0027supersticious\u0027 Church.\" He spits, getting emotional during his obviously summarized tale, \"5th Day, his Creations began fighting against the world, rather than with them against evil. One experiment could take on hundreds of regular soldiers alone, and so they laid waste, all while Simon was living the good life. Then, what do you know, the diseases evolved, went airborn, killed everyone but the faithful, those who stayed in the First Chapel. The Earth was dying, as God didn\u0027t want it to continue as it did, and only two groups survived; the Zealots, and the Creations. The next day involved war. W wanting to e slowly began building society back up, getting stronger technology and a bigger community. But it was not enough, and the Creations spread us weak and thin. But we\u0027re growing, and the Creations are now on the run, no doubt split between wanting to kill us or the Professor, who got them into this mess. Everything with them is \u0027kill\u0027, for they are demon-spawn.\u0027\u0027\n\nHe notices your eyese rolling and then bends down to your level, \"Look at you, boy, blood on his lips and unrelenting anger. This is mercy, to end your cursed life. As now, on the 7th day, we shall put all of the cursed to rest. They may resist, but we will go out of our way to end them.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, taking all of this in. There isn\u0027t that much to say, and you realize how much fragments you still don\u0027t know. There has to be more to this, though you\u0027re not sure why...\n\n\"Dramatic, no?\" He nods, continuing. \"Which makes me wonder where you fit into all of this. You don\u0027t have a name do you?\"\n\n\"Uh, no, I can\u0027t remember anything from before my awakening.\"\n\nThe Father frowned, \"Hmm, you must have been one of the last experiments if you\u0027re so young. Very well then, good night, I\u0027m afraid. May God have mercy on your soul...\" He turns to leave.\n\n\"Wait, you\u0027re killing me after all that?!? Come back here! I\u0027m sentient, I\u0027m human, just like YOU!\" You yell, struggling at the immobile chair.\n\nHe doesn\u0027t answer. A quick, firey death unexpectedly follows, your seat spewing out bursts of flame, charring through your body and burning your soul to a crisp. Red, then all black.\n\n\nYou have died by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 31": "Hit hard and fast. Only then will you be able to puncture the stone.\n\nUgh. I\u0027m trying!\n\nNot hard enough! I know what you\u0027re capable of so this game won\u0027t work with me. Let\u0027s try again; watch me closely this time.\n\n\nFrom what you\u0027re able to tell, your mentor is just throwing his arm at the boulder with as much brute force as he could muster, causing a large splintering in it\u0027s the middle of it, with his hand now stuck inside the middle. He withdraws it, and you notice the horrible scrapes on his forearms soon heal.\n\n\nNotice how I hit it?\n\nLooks to me like you just attacked it with all your might and nothing else. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the way it\u0027s supposed to go...\n\nWhatever do you mean? Embrace the beast, boy. Our primal natures are what make us human. Savor that. It may seem unrefined, but you have power--  I know you do, power that can only be unleashed by your raw spirit. Now attack it again, unrestrained!\n\nI... Isn\u0027t this supposed to be where you tell me I\u0027m supposed to find inner harmony before I can unlock all of my abilities?\n\n\nHe squints at you, probably struggling to notice your humor. Kelso simply sighs, waiting for you to comply.\n\nRight... just ust need to find out how to stop restraining myself. It isn\u0027t a conscious thought process... I think?\n\n\"Who or what do you hate more than anything?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Who, the Professor? Maybe?\n\n\nWith blunt force to your head, you find yourself toppling over. \"Get up!\" Your mentor roars angrily. You groan, getting up slowly, allowing your body to heal itself, right before Kelso kicks at you again.\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nAs if disregarding your cries for him to stop, he continues beating on you, up until the point you raggedly throw him off of yourself. Now that you\u0027re up, Kelso stares at you right in the eye, jumps in your direction, clawed hands out...\n\nAnd you move out of the way, just in time to land a solid, unrefined kick at him. He tumbles, though with an uncanny dexterity pops back up. You rush at him, with a hand held high ready to strike, and at the last moment he drops to the sand-covered ground and lets your hand land into the rock.\n\nUnfortunately, the tree remains intact and your hand has become horribly misshapen (though that\u0027ll no doubt heal soon), on the good side, however, the thick pillar has an obvious dent in addition to a new, more crooked position, leaning backwards from the force of your punch. Surprised by your success, you laugh even when Kelso trips you from the bottom.\n\n\n\"Now we\u0027re getting somewhere.\"\n",
  "page 30": "Kelso rubs at his clean chin. \"Elaborate.\"\n\nYou hold up the walky-talkie, \"If they know where the Professor is, then that means they\u0027re either working for him, like you\u0027re assuming, or are just planning their vengeance; If we can get a message to them, get their attention--\"\n\n\"Then the C.E. Soldiers will get to us and them.\"\n\n\"Not unless our signal is obscure, something only a Creation would know. Can I assume that we\u0027re the only one who refer to the Professor, as, well, a professor?\"\n\nYour mentor smiles, \"Yes... That\u0027s what the greater Creations called him. Myself, the Werewolf, Stein, and several others. We all were forced under the bastard to look over Lessers, like yourself. One of them are bound to be in this town, has the smallest C.E. division in the East. We just have to hope we\u0027ll be able to handle them in the case that they\u0027re still loyal. So you want us to send a wide broadcast, maybe even a flare labeled \u0027Professor\u0027, and hope we catch some of our brethren?\"\n\n\"That,\" you continue, \"or we lure the church to us by contacting them with the Walkie, and just beat the information out of them. By the sounds of it, they\u0027d be expecting a trap, so they wouldn\u0027t bring all their operatives to this location. Hopefully they have an idea where the other Creations are. It\u0027s not a perfect plan, but it\u0027s uh, better than yours. Don\u0027t think you can just nab one like you did with the last one, now that they\u0027re probably on guard.\"\n\nKelso nods, considering both of your plans, \"Much better. Regardless, Mr. Plans, we need to train.\"\n\n\"Train, for what?\" Crossing your arms as a child would, you question Kelso. \"I feel like you\u0027re not telling me everything. Even if the plan is solid, but we need to be solid, with, umm, each-other.\"\n\nWith a chuckle, Kelso replies, \"What do you think we\u0027re doing? We\u0027re fighting against an elite military operation, as well as bio-genetically advanced Creations. We\u0027re not playing here, son, there\u0027s going to be blood. I\u0027m pretty certain that you\u0027ll be able to be very powerful if we train accordingly. This may be surprising, but I think you should cherish your undeath while it lasts. Not to mention that I\u0027d rather not jeopardize myself.\"\n\n\"... So the Creations are going to be very hostile?\"\n\nHe shrugs in return, \"Maybe, more likely than not anyhow. We\u0027re betting on whether they\u0027re still loyal or not to their Creator.\"\n\n\"Why would they still be loyal to that... that bastard?\"\n\n\"Well, he did save our lives.\" You stand in silence with a confused frown. Kelso continues. \"Mind you, he also treated us like lab rats and played with our genetic-material. That\u0027s why we\u0027re going to find him and his Creations, to put an end to it once and for all, so no one else is \u0027saved\u0027 by that man.\" You nod in understanding. Kelso and yourself... You\u0027re going to help the world together. Clean it.\n\nA hero...\n\n\"The valley of dunes at night is the best place and time. We\u0027ll train today and tomorrow, and by then you should be ready. Now, more about that plan of yours...\"\n",
  "page 44": "You lower your voice, \"I... not sure. We\u0027re in some sort of house. Lots of sand.\"\n\nNo reply. You click it off.\n\nKelso nods in seeming approval. \"It\u0027ll do. Let\u0027s just hope they underestimate one Creation and send only a couple soldiers. They are tasked to deal with the unknown. I got lucky with \u0027Sebastian\u0027; the foolish Zealot wandered out alone.\"\n\n---\n\nYour mentor and youself make your way to a particularly large sand-dune near the house, watching for incoming Zealots from the city ahead.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t too long-- after several minutes you begin to notice flashing armors marching in the moonlight. Your house is a surprisingly straight line to the city, and you notice some lights, formed in clusters, moving straight in your direction. Others seem to be coming in on a flank, moving to the left and right of the city before circling in, near your location. None are too close though, which gives time for Kelso to count them all.\n\n\"Five groups of five in all, with the Church having only a slight notion where we are and us having the element of surprise.\"\n\n\"You think that\u0027s good odds? From what it seems, they likely no more about what we can do then what we know they can.\"\n\n\"Not we, you. I fought Zealots before the facility was destroyed, you know. Even if they\u0027ve grown considerably, they\u0027re still the fear-mongering, symbolic fools as ever. With enough force their armor can be clawed through, only thing you have to worry about is silver and their lightning rifles.\"\n\n\"Sounds fun.\" You chuckles out nervously, \"Silver bullets and lightning rifles?\"\n\n\"Ah yes, silver is specifically harmful to us, for whatever reason. It is very pure... and the only thing that will stop us from regenerating, thankfully though, I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve caught on to that just yet. The shock-troops they send in are equipped with monstrous bayonets that shoot out streams of electrons at high velocity, which are scarily painful...\" He notices your frown, and smiles in return, \"But it\u0027s healable. And I think we can do it.\"\n\nYou nod, \"Not if their flanks succeeds. We need to either split up and fight the ones coming on the side or take the clusters on together.\"\n\n\"No question, we should fight together. Splitting up may make this go faster and more efficiently, but it\u0027s dangerous enough that it won\u0027t be worth it. Together, we can capture one of them as well as efficiently annihilate the groups one by one.\"\n\nYou nod back, assured. Kelso may retain information, but he\u0027s never lied to you. You think.\n\nThis brings your mind back to the incoming horde of Zealots,  which are less than a mile away by now, marching tirelessly, not exactly in your direction, but close enough...\n\n\"So, who do you think we should take on first?\"\n",
  "page 43": "\"Divide and conquer, Mentor. Let\u0027s take out the smaller groups first.\"\n\nWith Kelso in tow, you make your way around to the other side. It takes longer, and you\u0027re certain the Zealots in the middle know you\u0027re there, but if you can finish off the five then the remaining ten are just more sheep coming to the slaughter.\n\nRunning, and dodging bolts of lightning from your right, you find the group from the left, dangerously close to the middle ones. In fact, it\u0027s almost like just a large group of fifteen, ready to fight you. But there is a gap, if you and Kelso can make it...\n\nThe green-lightning erupting from the rifles aren\u0027t very accurate, from what you\u0027ve gathered, but when shot in large numbers you admittedly weren\u0027t surprised when one slammed into your armor. It stings, but the metal absorbs most of the impact. So much, in fact, that it begins to burn and boil your skin under it. You immediately throw it off, by then close enough to the group that you won\u0027t have to worry about dodging another shot from them. While they reload, you jump at them, kicking in mid-air and ruthlessly cutting through the weak spots in their armor, near the neckline. After killing one, the other spears your back, holding it up in the air while another charges at you with his bayonet, ready to pierce...\n\nThankfully, Kelso was fast enough to jump, twist and turn so that his feet gained momentum--  and slam his foot on the incoming soldier, sending him several meters away. Not a problem for now.\n\nBut the rest of the Zealots closing in are. Using your blind-fury, you manage to make a slight somersault while your back was tusked, releasing you from it\u0027s tearing grip and causing the soldier to flip over.\n\nEven with these successes, you realize that it is no use. Lightning is shot into the back of your head, causing you to fall on the ground, your head burning but regenerating. You can\u0027t find Kelso during this, but you realize one thing; bad strategizing did this one in for you. Your flesh didn\u0027t heal itself when shot multiple times in quick succession.\n\n\nYou have died by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 46": "Every time the dial moves slightly less than a centimeter, you pause for thirty seconds, push the button and recite in monotone, \"Hello, are you knowledgeable about the Professor?\" Hoping you catch something or get a response. Kelso\u0027s eventual chuckles are disconcerting, to say the least, but you focus on the problem at hand. You continue pushing the dial to the right, passing it\u0027s original point and beyond. Meanwhile, you\u0027re praying to no deity in particular that your plan succeeds. You want to impress Kelso. He\u0027s like a father-figure, the first person you saw when your hatched out of your tube. On the other hand, he\u0027s a teacher who\u0027s withholding information, which gets frustrating at times. You remain conflicted about the only person you have met in your vampiric form.\n\nSuddenly, you hear a response. Short and you can\u0027t make out what it\u0027s saying, but it\u0027s something. You push the button and repeat, \"Hello?\" You stop pressing.\n\nLots of static, probably bad reception on their end. A gruff, snarling voice speaks out, \"Who\u0027s there? What\u0027s this about a professor?\"\n\n\"You know who I\u0027m talking about.\" You reply, hoping. \"The Professor, the one who Created us.\"\n\n\"Then who are you?\"\n\n\"A fellow Creation, and I want to join forces. The Zealots are too many in number for my liking.\"\n\n\"Do you really... Who\u0027s with you?\"\n\nYou look to Kelso, who brings a finger to his lips. \"Just... Just me. Why?\"\n\n\"Because you\u0027re lying.\" The voice coughs, sending over a truly ugly sound over the transceiver, \"But no matter. You wish to join the Wolves then, right?\"\n\n\"Assuming your group can take care of itself. How many are your group and where are you?\"\n\n\"Five and growing. You won\u0027t find it, it\u0027s under the ground.\"\n\nAnd growing? \"So can you lead me to where you guys are?\"\n\nYou wait a couple of moments, and then he answers, \"Hmm... Nah. We don\u0027t need more nutbars in this camp. I\u0027d rather not bring attention to our hideout from the Zealots.\"\n\nSon of a bitch. \"Well, you\u0027re missing out, Wolfie.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m sure I am, haha.\"\n\nYou click it off. \"Sorry, Kelso, that was pretty pointless.\"\n\n\"Though interesting. It doesn\u0027t sound like they\u0027re too interested in finding the Professor, rather just survival. Perhaps with a little arm twisting we can get in there...\"\n\n\"If we find out where they are.\"\n\n\"Well, that\u0027s what Plan B is for, right?\"\n",
  "page 45": "You continue to finish the ones trying to attack you. It is a quick fight, considering. Kelso rushes ahead, jumping up and using the butt of his new bayonet to whack the head-Zealot of this group over the head, not snapping his eck but at the very least knocking him out.\n\nWith blood-lust, you manage to bring up the hulking weapons to shoot lightning at one the group at point-blank, causing him to scream as his own armor boiled him. The others, no doubt bewildered by many things at the current moment, try their best to survive in various ways.\n\nOne continues struggling, actually managing to spear Kelso and shoot at the same time, only to find Kelso laugh, bring his arms back and snap the man\u0027s neck before getting out of the tusks.\n\nOne calls out to his god. In turn you gutted him with your rifle, piercing his armor like a can-opener.\n\nAnd one from the other side of the battle-field, that you obviously didn\u0027t kill correctly, gets up to flee back to the city. Even he didn\u0027t get a break. Kelso, with uncanny familiarity with the rifle, shoots him in the back. The flashing Zealot slumps over, dead.\n\nThe fight ends there, and Kelso puts his hand on your back as you walk to the unconscious head-Zealot of the Left-group.\n\n\"So, what do we do with him?\" You ask, warily, \"The Church will probably send more of it\u0027s operatives to subdue us.\"\n\n\"Doubt it. The head-honchos in the Church are probably terrified right now. More Creations in addition to \u0027The Wolves\u0027 are definitely not what they wanted. Still, you\u0027re right. We need to find a new place, but only after we find out where the Wolves are, and subdue them.\"\n\n\"You still think they know where the Professor is?\"\n\nHe looks at you, pondering, \"Unsure. If they do, then we\u0027ll have to fight them. Which is doable, with your newfound talents.\" He points to bloody undergarments, \"But if they hate the Professor as much as we do then we can join forces. Well, you might. I might have to leave soon.\"\n\nYou frown. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Ha, don\u0027t worry kid. I might not have to, but if I do I\u0027ll make sure you\u0027re ready to fend for your self.\"\n",
  "page 48": "You push the button on the walkie-talkie, and speak into it. \"Hello?\"\n\nMoments pass. After several more crackles you get a response. A cool female voice speaks out, \"Sebastian? Seargent, is everything alright?\" British?\n\nKelso shoots you a sideways glance. You can almost feel him sending you a message with his eyes. Be creative, you call the shots for now.\n\nYou blink. Ahem, \"I have spotted some of the err, creations.\"\n\n\"Well of course you have.\" Matter of fact tone. \"We\u0027ve known where the devils that are the Wolves have been for a while now. We just need to strike them. Which reminds me, we should get back to base.\"\n\nPerfect. Ish. \"No! The, uh, lord helped me and I found others.\"\n\n\"Others? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"There are other Creations that have escaped aside from the, uh, wolves, and-\"\n\nThe woman on the other side is excited, \"More?\"\n\n\"Um, only one. That I found, at least. But one is one too many. I uh, need backup.\"\n\n\"Stop stuttering, Sebastian. This is important. Where are you? Now searching it up...\" Pause. \"Your GPS tracker hasn\u0027t been functioning for a couple of days. That\u0027s probably why security has tightened around the City. Where the hell are you?\"\n\nShit. \"Well, uh, the battery died and, uh, things happened.\"\n\n\"Things? Sebastian, I... Did it take you hostage?\"\n\nYou\u0027ve decided you like her voice. \"It?\"\n\nShe lowers her voice, \"What is your general location, Sebastian? We\u0027ll find you. You\u0027ll be safe.\"\n\nYou pause, looking to Kelso for help. To tell the truth, you have no idea where you are. Kelso looks the other way. You sigh, annoyed at him. Maybe he\u0027s just a bit offended that your plan was better. Or not.\n\n\"I...\"\n",
  "page 47": "\"Err, uh, yeah. Let\u0027s try my other plan.\"\n\nKelso laughs. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"Hey, both of my plans were better than your\u0027s.\" You argue, setting the dial back to where it was. Now that you think about it, you wonder why the Church never went out looking for the Zealot which your mentor killed, and you killed. Perhaps they did, just you and Kelso never noticed it. Or perhaps the Zealots often went out in long journeys without communication.\n\nNo matter now, You realize, they\u0027ll pick up at the signal. Somebody will.\n\nExcitedly, you fidget for the WT, and grasp it firmly. You clear your throat to speak, but Kelso briefs you.\n\n\"Remember, just put the channel on. Listen in and wait for a while, and if nothing turns up then try speaking. But only then.\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"It might.\"\n\nYou cough again, then breathe in. Out. In.\n\nYou put the dial back to where it was in the first place.\n\nOut. Nothing but static, for now. Minutes go by. You stand at the ready. But all is static. Ten minutes turns to half an hour, though your body doesn\u0027t stop tensing. Something is coming.\n",
  "page 49": "You continue waiting. Time turns to an entire hour forward, and Kelso is getting antsy...\n\nCrackling. \"Sebastian? Sebastian, where are you?\"\n\nThe sudden noise surprises you and  you let out a sharp, \"Ahh!\", which makes Kelso sigh loudly. Thankfully, they can\u0027t hear you unless you press the button to speak.\n\nThe voice repeats itself. You recognize it as female, cool and British.\n\n\"H-hello?\"\n\n\"Sebastian! Thank the lord you\u0027re safe! We haven\u0027t been able to contact you for days!\"\n\n\"Wh-why is that?\" You stutter out, trying to mimic what you remember of the Zealot\u0027s voice best you can.\n\n\"GPS-tracker stopped responding a couple of days ago. I only saw this now, but that\u0027s probably why security has tightened around the City. Where are you? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"I, uh, yes, I am.\" You try to think of a way to get some soldiers here. \"I found another Creation.\"\n\n\"Another one? Like, one that isn\u0027t part of the Wolves?\"\n\nHer voice sounds nice, you decide. \"Yeah, different.\"\n\n\"Have you made contact with the demon yet?\"\n\n\"Um, no, but I need back-up.\"\n\n\"Wait, what happened? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Of course. I just... We need to catch these guys, don\u0027t we?\"\n\nShe seems agitated as well as worried, \"We don\u0027t tackle on Creations alone, weren\u0027t you briefed?\"\n\nYou try your best to pull this off, \"Listen I... Just need back-up.\"\n\nShe pauses, \"Are you... Captured? Sebastian, where the hell are you!\"\n\nNailed it.\n",
  "page 40": "\"Let\u0027s start on a side and move on from there. We can\u0027t let their flank be affective.\" Your mentor nods. \"There was a reason why I saved you, even if I didn\u0027t realize it at the time.\"\n\n\"Which is...?\"\n\n\"You\u0027re smart.\"\n\nYou\u0027d blush if could, you like compliments, \"No, the reason why you got me in the first place.\"\n\n\"You\u0027ll find out at some point.\"\n\nYou both laugh. Kelso drops information every once in a while, and at some point you want to just have several hours with him to discuss everything. Was the world always like this? What happened to it? What is my purpose? And on and on.\n\nBy now the collection of lights are nearing, so you stop chatting with your master and turn your attention to them. Keeping your head close to the ground and sneaking to the right, you prepare to overtake the group of five on that side. Your mind flashes back to your training in the training you did with Kelso in the dunes. You try your best to channel your anger while you run, Kelso behind, at the Zealots.\n\nWhy should I hate the Church? Your mind answers. Because they hate me for what I am. The man called Sebastian called me a \u0027demon\u0027; I\u0027m not that. I know I\u0027m not that. But they will crucify me if they can. And I won\u0027t let them do that to myself or Kelso.\n\nWith your mind settled on some sort rage, you vent it with your sprinting, reaching the Zealots quick enough. They\u0027re big people, the C.E. Soldiers. Stygian black metal overlays their entire bodies, with an obvious group leader with a different helmet (with horns, like a medieval knight\u0027s would have.) The rest have a simplistic SWAT-team-like helmet with a visor. The most notable part of their ensemble is their heavily tusked rifles, which take up both of their arms, if only to carry the heavy block of metal. You assume that that\u0027s the thing that Kelso mentioned; the lightning bayonets. \u0027That, and their lit cross on the chest, flashing on and off. Thankfully, they don\u0027t seem to notice you, yet. Their heavy metal probably restricts them of that.\n\nYou pay little attention to where Kelso is, and you angrily lash out on the leader, leaping from over eight meters away from the ground. While in the air, you let your claws grow out and you come onto the huge black being\u0027s chest, and sink your claws into him, through the weak parts of his armor. Wet, sticky blood pours out, and you messily continue to clutch onto him while he tries to shoot you off with his tusked-bayonet. He manages to shoot up wards once or twice before slumping to the ground, the Other Zealots probably pissing their pants at this point. You roar at them, jumping off the corps of their leader and sending a heavy-fisted slash at a close one that is unbashfully trying to use hiw walkie-talkie. The hand you send clunks off of his helmet, but the heavy crunch you feel from it obviously means you broke his neck.\n\nWhile you were busy with two, Kelso (still unseen) has done fine work with the remaining three, his body half-transformed into something... Animalistic. With hairy, muscular arms and sharp teeth he overpowers them easily, ripping heads off at insane speeds, to the point that you\u0027re convinced that you imagined part of it. After several lightning flashes from the last one, Kelso\u0027s new body soaks up the energy from it and grabs the Zealot, throwing him to the floor. Now, all that remains are you and your mentor. You hungrily sink your teeth into a nearby combatant, reinvigorating yourself. Kelso morphs back, seeming tired, and takes a helping from one of them. After only ten seconds, he grabs you to stop with him.\n\n\"That\u0027s one group down. There are three more groups to annihilate, two to the left (what used to be the middle) and the third which is standing back, way over to the left. I\u0027ll assume we\u0027re moving on to the middle?\"\n",
  "page 42": "\"Indeed, the middle-men are next.\"\n\nTwo groups of hulking Zealots stand between you and the other. They know you\u0027re there, and the element of surprise isn\u0027t yours anymore. Worse yet, Kelso seems to have used up whatever the hell that transformation was. Still, you\u0027re confident that Kelso and you can tackle on the fifteen Zealots left over,\n\nYou see them aiming their blockish weapons at you, and charge. Two leaders... You look to Kelso, and he nods. You take one, and he takes the other.\n\nAs they move forward with their tusks, streaks of bright green at you. You quickly move to the side, allowing for some to take mercy and miss, but one or two manage to land on your armor, causing it to heat up...\n\nKelso manages to dodge every single one shot at him, and runs up ahead of you to disarm the Zealots shooting at you. While your metallic armor sizzles, you do your best to throw it off you and follow-up with Kelso before they reload and shoot again. Kelso jumps into the air, swinging his foot down on one of the head-Zealots-head. It doesn\u0027t take him out, but it stuns  him long enough for Kelso to throw him at the other line of Zealots, and proceed to restlessly break their weapons by punching it. The Zealots try to fight him, but your mentor doesn\u0027t give up.\n\nMeanwhile, you quickly sweep the other Head\u0027s feet from under him during the confusion of Kelso\u0027s utter... coolness and fluidity in combat.  You stomp your sneakers on it\u0027s neck; the crack is all you needed to hear.\n\nMore bright streaks. You see the remaining six Soldiers trying to surround him and put him down, not paying as much attention to you. In return for their disrespect, you bring both of your hands to your sides, and begin a large tackle at the horde surrounding your master. Your rage-fueled push causes you to bleed (you\u0027re slamming your arms onto cold metal, remember) but pushes them all on top of eachother, all scarmbling to get up.\n\nKelso manages to get out of the huddle of Zealots, and picks up one of the bayonets, and begins spiking the clunky radicals. More, deliciously red blood squirts out, and you follow suit by taking your own bayonet. Now, only one group left.\n\nFive fearful Zealots pitifully trying to snipe at both of you. But it\u0027s obvious who will win this fight, in your eyes.\n",
  "page 41": "You point forwards. \"Let us obliterate the ten in front first, then move on to the sides. That is their main strike force, after all.\" Your mentor shrugs in turn.\n\n\"You\u0027re the boss, kid. Just make sure we both survive, alright?\"\n\nGrin. You crack your knuckles, hearing more nitrogen bubbles pop than you expected. Still, the implication that you\u0027re more than ready for battle is caught by Kelso, who laughs.\n\n\"Lead on, then.\"\n\nAs the lights on the side continue their march, you silently sneak around the dune, starting to walk towards the lights ahead. Slowly... then you break out to a run, then a sprint; you can hear Kelso on your side, like a shadow. You can\u0027t even see him, but he\u0027s there, following you. You approach the groups, them not noticing your pale body, regardless that you\u0027re wearing one of their own armors. Even from afar, you notice their elite-uniforms. Stygian black suits with flashy lining, and an  illuminating cross across their collective chests. Both of the groups have an obvious leader, with a horned helmet, reminiscent of the medieval ones knights used to wear. The rest just have simplistic, though futuristic, SWAT-team helmets with visors. The easily most intriguing thing is their tusked rifles, all huge and blocky. No doubt in your mind, those are the weapons you should watch out for most.\n\nYou continue your run, and you\u0027re very thankful they aren\u0027t the most perceptive bunch. Once your only 15 meters away, you hear a voice in your ear.\n\nMake the first move\n\nA nod. The moment one of them notices you moving forward, you leap at him, body-slamming him with all the momentum you\u0027ve been buidling up. Even though you think they\u0027re higher-ranking than Sebastian was, your armor seems to be strong enough to send one of the flying with a clank, and falling on the ground with a thud. He twitches, but doesn\u0027t get up. By now, the nine surviving look at you. The leader eyes you from behind his helmet, \"God has delivered you into our hands. All troops, move in!\"\n\nYou here a crackle, no doubt from a walkie-talkie... Shit. Shit. Shit.\n\nWith a quick turn you swing your arm, desperate and angry. Your claws rip at his metal face, and it thankfully looks like you hurt him more than you hurt yourself. Your hand may sting and bleed from bashing metal, but the one leader staggers backward, as the rest aim their rifles at you. Suddenly, a cold wind passes, and blood squirts out from the leader\u0027s neck, his head suddenly missing. \"Kelso!\"\n\nShocked, the Zealots look around, and a storm of lightning shots are fired in many different directions. Eight of the Zealots are left, but... You pushed back as one of the shots hit you, the lightning burning your skin. You feel it growing back, but you\u0027re slowed. You jump at one of the closest ones, kicking at him with your ragged sneakers, and using that as leverage to leap at another one. After the push, you can feel him keel over with a gasp, but the other one stick his rifle right into you. You gasp, your mouth watering at the bloody sight. By now, the shadow that is Kelso has taken four or five of them, but even he was skewered by the other group-leader. More anger being built inside of you, you send a wicked, blood-felt punch at the Zealot who has you on the other side of his bayonet. The punch si probably the strongest one you\u0027ve dealt, sending him and his rifle out of you. More blood squirts, and some even gets into your mouth (which feels good, gives you vigor). Kelso seems to disappear, no longer on the other C.E. Soldier\u0027s rifle, and in the confusion you forget that there are at least ten more Zealots coming in from all sides...\n\nA tingling feeling is felt and you find yourself on the sandy floor, bloody and beaten. The Zealots take turns shooting at you, making sure the demon has been destroyed.\n\nYour last thought is on why Kelso abandoned you...\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 101": "Hours pass quicker than you\u0027d want during the training sessions. You\u0027ve realized that the Wolves are powerful, but undisciplined, almost childish at times. But at the end of the night, you got work done. Yet, even after the night passes, Gideon routinely goes under the hatch. You\u0027ve tried to peek at him, in interest of what he does when alone, but it brings no more results than asking around; zilch. But on one of those times you spend upside down, silently hanging from the hatch, Gideon turns around to acknowledge you.\n\nThe hunchbacked leader stares back at you with cold eyes, \"What do you want, lad? You think it\u0027s possible I really do just like sitting down here, alone?\"\n\nShocked, you suddenly lose your grip; only to land upright, as a cat would. \"I, uh, maybe. But I\u0027ve asked around, and people wonder about you, as I do. You\u0027re very... Silent, for a leader.\"\n\nHe laughs, \"Leader? Hah, that\u0027s good, Vampire. I just do the heavy work, as always. Keeping watch is one of my duties.\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t put yourself down, Gideon. You seem to know what you\u0027re doing.\" You say, unsure how to respond to his glumness.\n\n\"Vamp, the camp here believes you-- and that\u0027s fine by me, I\u0027ll be honest and say I trust you too, but the fact that we\u0027ll be fighting the Church isn\u0027t a good thing, regardless of the rewards.\"\n\n\"Like our lives?\"\n\n\"You\u0027re young and timeless, so it\u0027s not something you can really sympathize with.\" Gideon snorts, \"No offense, Vamp.\"\n\n\"None taken, but what do you mean?\" You say, letting him continue.\n\n \"I don\u0027t think you really get what the Church is. I mean, I don\u0027t think anybody here does. Even Ragnor, he\u0027s blinded by rage and fury. He believes that the Church needs to be destroyed for the betterment of everyone, especially us. But...\"\n\n\"But what?\" By now you\u0027re getting a bit agitated at Gideon for being so ambiguous.\n\nHe turns his face away, \"But he\u0027s dead wrong about it. Almost all of us here remember the treatments the Professor gave us. To say the least, you\u0027re lucky to have forgotten most, if not all of them. That man just bred hatred, even more than the religious back in the day.\" A pause. \"He hurt us all, in so many ways. But worse yet, he made us hurt others. It started with killing evil, but then came to killing innocents, the only food-source left for us. And we followed him through fire and water, that man. Kurschner represented our hopes and dreams, true power for a true purpose. But he lied to us, and used us for himself, experimented with us, made sure our past lives weren\u0027t there so that there was nothing for us to go back to. Even I don\u0027t remember too much of what was before I became a Wolf. The dreams stop after you get comfortable in your form.\"\n\nThe older gentlemen continues, \"By the way, are you still dreaming?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" You begin to realize that you indeed have stopped dreaming since you joined, \"No, I rest much better now.\"\n\nHe frowns in return, \"Best not get too comfortable here, then. Those dreams are your only way to know what is really going on.\"\n\n\"Which also reminds me, did you have somebody help you get out of the Facility before it was burnt down?\"\n\n\"Err, yes.\" You nervously answer.\n\n\"Did he have a name?\"\n\n\"Kelso.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Ahem, uh, Kelso.\" You repeat, slower this time. \"He said he knew you. Also mentioned a fellow named Stein.\"\n\nGideon bites his lip, \"Never met a fellow named Kelso. Did he say anything else?\"\n\n\"He mentioned being tasked with watching the Lesser Creations, along with several other elites.\"\n\n\"That explains it, though I can\u0027t say I know who he is under his new pseudo-name. I wonder where he is now...\"\n\n\"I wish I knew, \" you say, longingly, \"he said he\u0027d come back at some point, he was searching for the Professor.\"\n\n\"As do we all.\" Gideon says, closing his eyes, \"Simon Kurschner was one evil, however brilliant man. A lot of our older members ran out in hopes to hunt him down, though they never returned...\"\n",
  "page 100": "\"Hey Vamp, take a seat.\" Ragnor calls out, waving you over to the off-kilter wooden bench he\u0027s sitting on. You comply; after several days and nights with barely any breaks, even sitting down to converse with the balding man who broke your Ghoul\u0027s neck sounds appealing. Plus, he can\u0027t exactly complain about not getting work done if he\u0027s taking a breather as well. If there\u0027s one thing you know about Ragnor, it\u0027s that he hates the Church more than anything. Except maybe the Professor; you\u0027ve never really talked with him that much, after all. The cloaked man smiles at you, and helps sit you down with a heavy hand clutching onto your shoulder. \"Hey man, I\u0027m really glad you joined us,\" he begins, taking his arm off of you and bringing it in front for a handshake; you respond in kind.\n\n\"Not as glad as I am to have joined.\" You laugh, releasing.\n\n\"Don\u0027t be so sure. It was getting rather stale, just hiding out in a bunker until we run out of food. You\u0027ve given us something to strive for.\"\n\n\"Fighting the Church?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He nods, pauses, then shows out his palms to you in a waving motion, \"I know, I know. Gideon\u0027s not exactly fond of it, but if it comes down to us and them, I vote us.\" Ragnor laughs. \"You know, the moment you said that the Church is planning to destroy us, I already was planning on trying to overthrow the city.\"\n\n\"You seemed very confident about it.\" You nod, rubbing at your chin, \"But why?\"\n\n\"So that we have a stronghold strong enough that we won\u0027t be able to be exterminated that easily. We\u0027re a small group, the Creations. And it\u0027s not exactly a growing population either, at best you can ghoul whatever, but we can\u0027t breed normally. It takes more time for it to work, you know...\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, amused, \"You\u0027ve tried?\"\n\n\"Ha, back when I was practically mind-controlled by the Professor, yeah. Heck, he probably tried things with you while you were unconscious, but who knows? Life before civilization fell was much different than now. The bastard wanted to create a new specie of man, and instead he got Hollywood monsters with bad skin conditions.\" He shrugs, \"But in some ways he succeeded, and I think that the Church shouldn\u0027t be allowed to hunt us down for it\u0027s own sake. There are some good kids in our pack, you know. Just honest-to-god decent kids that the Church wants to put down. It\u0027s not right.\"\n\n\"So what will you be doing if you suceed?\"\n\n\"Hunt down the Professor, definitely. The Church may be corrupt, but the root of the evil afflicted to the world spawned from that one man. After we end the Church in the nearby city, then we\u0027ll be able to be in charge.\"\n\n\"You seem confident that a couple of Creations can take on hundreds of Zealots.\"\n\nRagnor looks at you with a wry grin, \"You seem to be under a false-impression-- there really aren\u0027t that many Zealots. Can\u0027t be. The city they have is large, but only in comparison to other strongholds. Zealots are almost always male, if only because armor-fitting females is different, and they\u0027re probably sparse on metal. Plus, only able-bodied men can wield those huge-ass rifles. I\u0027d say they have 200 Zealots tops, and that\u0027s not including how many you\u0027ve just killed. Furthermore, they\u0027ll be divided while they march to our hideout and...\"\n\n\"That\u0027s still a lot.\"\n\nHe shrugs, \"As Wolves, we can shift either at will or automatically when stimulated luminescent orbs for some reason, into huge were-beasts. With proficiency, we can prove to be the fastest and most lethal things left on the planet. If, this week, we can train the kids to use their powers well, then it\u0027s definitely doable.\"\n\n\"You sure Gideon\u0027s okay with it?\" You ask, wondering whether you\u0027ll be joining him for sure,\n\n\"Regardless of what Gideon thinks about it, I won\u0027t be taking everybody with me, that\u0027s too much of a risk, and I doubt I could convince everybody, but...\"\n\nYou shrug, changing the subject, \"How experienced are you at your abilities?\"\n\n\"Enough.\"\n\n\"You think you can take me on?\" You ask, leaning forward and balancing your body on your palms.\n\n\"Maybe. I kind of figure the Vampire Creations were made in order to build foundations for the Professor. They can live forever, create progeny of sorts, etc. I have no idea how combat ready they are. Still, you\u0027re extremely resourceful, so I definitely hope you stick around. With your ghouling powers, we can create an entire civilization of Creations. Imagine how great that\u0027d be!\"\n\n\"I\u0027ll be honest, Ragnor; you didn\u0027t seem so cheery when I first met you.\"\n\n\"When you first met me I had to make a good impression.\" He laughs. \"Now, come on, we need to get back to training the cubs.\"\n",
  "page 103": "David watches, sure in your chances and not wanting to get in your way while you set up a defensive stance, planting your feet to the ground and readying your hands at the sides. Katar, parallel to you, closes the door behind him, and then raises his sword, pointing it at you. \"So, you fear God?\"\n\n\"Not in yours.\" You laugh back, maintaining composure. He\u0027s trying to get me off-guard, that\u0027s what this mad-man wants.\n\n\"Then perhaps you find fear in his servants instead, fool. Why else would you not attack me before I ready my blade? Katar slowly approaches you, his long sword only a quick-thrust away from your armored chest.\n\nYou don\u0027t feel the need to respond, instead focusing on his blade. You remember Kelso mentioning to you that you won\u0027t regenerate from silver-caused cuts, making this the most dangerous fight you\u0027ve been in, yet. You can only hope that after you survive this, you can make sure the Church doesn\u0027t have too much silver lying about. They probably have some idea of whether it works or not, otherwise Katar wouldn\u0027t have a silver katana.\n\nThe aloof Zealot chuckles, \"Then this will be an easy fight.\" He holds his sword with both hands, winds up, and swings it at your midsection, expecting you to duck and die. Thankfully, you saw through the ruse, and sidestep, only to slam the sword with your gauntlet out of Karat\u0027s hands. Angrily, he punches at you, sending a gauntleted fist at your nose. You get pushed back, but feel alright after rubbing it with your metal-covered wrist. You send a boot at the man\u0027s shins, making his knees bend, giving you perfect reach for swinging at his head. You feel his skull from under his skin after the blow, and the Zealot is pushed several meters away-- right next to his sword! Even though Karat is coughing blood, he gets up, using the sword as a cane.\n\n\"COME AT ME, DEMON!\" The bearded man yells, raising his word once more.\n\nYou shake your head, not falling for it. He angrily charges for you, only to be sucker-punched and knocked out before he could swing.\n\nYou stare at the man, then spit. \"This pathetic being is the Chief?\"\n\n\"Second in command, actually. Chief is probably fighting Gideon right now. But really, I don\u0027t think you realize how close you were to dying back there.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nDavid touches at your nose, \"I think his gauntlet is partly silver, so I don\u0027t think you\u0027re nose will fix itself.\"\n\nBoth of you laugh. If the worst thing that happens to us is that we get broken noses, then we\u0027re doing pretty good. \"So what now?\"\n\n\"Well, before the rest of the Zealots appear, we should probably try to kill Father Tomas, in the Church. Or, we could clear out this building while we--\"\n\n\"It\u0027s not a question, we finish the mission. Ragnor and the rest can take care of themselves.\"\n\nAt that very moment, sirens begin to blare, and red lights beam on-and-off all over the HQ...\n",
  "page 224": "\"So you know this chump?\"\n\n\"I... I think so. It\u0027s been a while, but...\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"He looks different.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Paler.\"\n\n\"Well, we\u0027re going to have to do something with him. That\u0027s Zealot-issue armor he\u0027s got there, and the others weren\u0027t supposed to come back for several more years. You think he might know something about Sebastian?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we could ask him, you know.\"\n\n\"Too true, assuming he\u0027s woken yet.\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t wake him, Zadok. He looks like he needed a rest.\"\n\n\"Yeah-yeah. I could use a rest too, but I don\u0027t get this kind of luxury. The Father may be a benevolent man, but he\u0027s doesn\u0027t spare any expenses for even his most elite supporters. Bastard.\"\n\n\"Especially his Elite supporters.\" Giggling, followed by the sound feet shuffling towards you.\n\n\"Woah, hey, Alice-- he\u0027s waking up. Get over here!\"\n\nYour eyes open to the prodding of a wooden stick, lightly tapping at your eyelids. You blink several times before you manage to get your stiff body parts up and about. The room is a simple one, made of wood and lit by several candles. A cracked window lets you know that it\u0027s pretty dark outside too. I m\"ust have been out for a couple of hours, then.\n\n\"Hey buddy, you gonna greet the man who saved your life?\" You turn your head to see a grinning, darkly-armored bear of a man with auburn hair and a gorilla-like face shape, \"Glad to see you made it, man. Thought we lost you there. Got a name? Mine\u0027s Zadok.\" After setting down a large tusked object that you can\u0027t make out exactly, he holds out a hand to shake.\n\n\"N-no... Not exactly,\" you nervously chuckle out, further examining the Zealot; huge, by anyone\u0027s standards, and built. He seems to have reddish, scarred skin and heavy eyebrows and a powerful jaw, with bright amber eyes staring at you peculiarly.\n\nHe withdraws his hand. \"Huh? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just... Don\u0027t remember it.\"\n\n\"Alice, you gotta come over here, man, this guy doesn\u0027t even remember his name! For Christ sakes man, what happened to you?\" He has a gruff voice, but he doesn\u0027t seem too antagonistic...\n\n\"... I, uh, just said I don\u0027t remember my name. You think I remember other things?\"\n\n\"Gotta say, I like your lip,\" he smirks. \"But, well, how far back do you remember?\" Zadok continues, taking a seat in your room and sitting on it backwards, his knees spread out on the back. His huge palms grip the back at the chair as he asks you further, \"And why the hell were you wearing C.E. Issue armor?\"\n\n\"Well, I...\" You are cut-off mid-sentence when a dark haired girl enters the room, looking incredibly perplexed. The conversation immediately stops, and you find yourself awkwardly waving while she narrows her eyes at you and Zadok.\n\nWith a second look at you, she sighs and turns to leave.\n\n\"Well, that\u0027s Alice, if you couldn\u0027t guess. Says she knows you or something\", so that\u0027s probably why she left all emotional.\" The Zealot continues, \"But, uh, yah. You were saying?\"\n\n\"Right, well, the first thing I really remember was running from some sort of factory, and for a week or so a... Colleague of mine made the situation so I had to, uh, leave and I ran to get shelter... Here.\"\n\n\"Okay. So, how\u0027d you get that armor, then?\"\n\nYou frown, uncertain how to answer that. \"I... Found it. In one of the shelters I found before getting here.\"\n\nYou see Zadok scratching at his head nervously, then biting at his lip. \"We... We gotta see Father Tomas, he knows the most about this sorta thing. Too many questions of my own, and I certainly can\u0027t figure this out, haha...\"\n\n\"Father Tomas?\"\n\n\"He\u0027s kinda our leader, yeah. We probably should have told him about you earlier, \u0027stranger coming from nowhere\u0027 and all, but he\u0027s a good guy, you\u0027ll see. The Father knows what he\u0027s doing, and could probably answer some of your questions with that brain of his.\"\n\nYou remain in silence, contemplating it. Father Tomas; that means he\u0027s a Holy-man, right? Would that mean I\u0027d be in danger if he knew about my... Condition?\n\n\"You want to see Father Tomas or not, man?\"\n",
  "page 102": "Barely letting him finish his speech, you lunge-- bringing the heel of your palm down near his jaw, only for him to deftly dodge out of the way. He shuffles several meters to the right, and raises his sword. He points at you, \"By God\u0027s glory, the dead will stay dead tonight.\" Quickly, he swipes with his blade, you dodging it by as little as a hair. You continue to bend your spine in ways you never imagined you could, but remain on the offensive by clawing at him at every chance you have.\n\nYou send a kick at his shin-- causing his knees to bend, and  charge him with all your body force, screeching and yelling like a cat. You lay on top of him, and begin mercilessly pounding his bearded face, before he manages to separate you and him just by his sword-- which you angrily rip out of his grip, only for it to clumsily flip and cut into your forehead. He takes advantage of this and kicks you off, coughing out blood and quickly running for his sword. You try to reach for it, to no avail. David, now certain you need his help, jumps on Katar\u0027s back, trying to strangle the elite Zealot. Even with David on his back, he\u0027s able to stab you with his sword while you\u0027re still baffled as to why you\u0027re not regenerating your wounds properly. The cold steel hacks at your bones, and you begin crying out in pain while the holy man continues to mock you. Once you\u0027re incapacitated, the now ear-less Karat flings David off of him, and beheads him in front of you, the glum expression ever-present on your ghoul\u0027s head. He doesn\u0027t even need to finish you off, and you feel your energy being drained out.\n\nOn the plus side, you did manage to end the fight relatively quickly.\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 226": "Zadok clasps his hands together, \"That\u0027s uh, great. Evening just started, though, so we\u0027ll have to wait a couple hours until Father finishes his daily study. You want to, eat or something? And you gotta come up with a name, too weird to just refer to you by pointing, haha.\"\n\nYou give a weary chuckle, \"Yeah, I bet I\u0027ll come up with something. As for something to... Eat, you said?\" Human! \"No, not that...\" you mumble with a shiver.\n\n\"Huh?\" The Zealot looks behind himself before looking at you quizzically, \"Yeah. Alice makes awesome tea, you know. Rare to find the right ingredients for it and hot water is hard to come by, so you\u0027d be lucky to get some of it.\" He pauses, \"Want some? Or, uh, you know-- something?\"\n\n\"Uh, no need, really. I\u0027m fine.\" Couldn\u0027t drink it anyway. I think?\n\n\"You sure?\" Zadok asks, his brows furrowing as he rubs his chin. \"Don\u0027t be shy man, I think you could use it more than the average person we help out. You look beat.\"\n\n\"Well... Alright.\" You comply with a frown. \"If you really want to, you know...\"\n\nHe gets up to give you a pat on the back, and then he leaves. You hear some discussion, but you can\u0027t exactly make it out. Several moments pass and you take the time to get up and stretch your limbs. It takes several twists and turns but eventually your forearms and legs relax to the point of being as spry as ever. Your mind wanders to several points; How long can I go on without blood? How much does Alice know about me? How am I going to hide my existence as a creature of the dead? And what is the Father going to do with me once I\u0027m in his clutches?\n\nYou take an unnecessary deep breath, your lungs not expanding or contracting as you do so, the air going in and out, straight. You take Zadok\u0027s seat near the door, waiting for the tea to be ready. What\u0027s taking so long?\n\nSoon later, you hear footsteps nearing your room. The dark-haired Alice knocks on what you assume is some sort of post (as the door was left wide-open by Zadok) before entering. She takes a deep breath before handing you a modest cup of a dark red liquid with a wobbly hand, the other maintaining its spot near her waist.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you state, accepting it, though juggling whether you should drink it, still uncertain on how your anatomy works.\n\nAlice closes the door behind her, \"Don\u0027t worry, you can drink it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nHer voice is different than the ones you\u0027ve heard as of recently-- English, maybe? Either way, you\u0027ve decided it sounds rather pleasant. You notice her left hand clenching as she winces, \"It... It\u0027s safe for you to drink the tea. Trust me.\"\n\nUncertain and more than just confused, you take a sip out of the tea. Once you swallow, you feel the familiar euphoria you had before, though admittedly watered down. She put blood in this, didn\u0027t she?\n\nYou look up, \"Alice, you know who I am? What happened to me? Please tell me!\"\n\n\"Zadok said you want to see Father Tomas. You... You can\u0027t...\" Alice continues, grasping at her hair.\n\n\"Why-- Why not?\"\n\n\"Father Tomas is our leader, and a good one! But...\"\n\n\"But what?\" You respond, getting up. You\u0027re not really sure what to do-- she\u0027s beginning to tear up...\n\n\"Just don\u0027t, please. He\u0027ll either kill you or use you, that\u0027s it!\"\n\n\"Use me? For what? What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe nears you, tears in her green eyes, placing her hands on your cheeks. \"If you promise to not meet him then I-- I\u0027ll tell you things abut the... The past. You don\u0027t need Tomas!\"\n\nFor whatever reason, you feel drawn to her. It\u0027s an unnatural feeling, and although you don\u0027t remember her at all, something about her makes you long for something of the past, though you\u0027re not sure what it is. Bottom line is, however, you have no idea what she\u0027s on about.\n\n\"Um, Alice, the Father And plus, what do you want me to do? The moment it catches wind that I\u0027m here this Tomas guy will definitely know. I don\u0027t want to be stuck in a house, and Zadok isn\u0027t a fool either. Tomas is my ticket into knowing exactly what\u0027s flying in the world and also so I can find the-- the Professor.\"\n\nAlice looks like she was going to say something else, but instead just releases your face and asks, \"Who?\"\n\nYou sigh, \"You probably know him by some other moniker. But to me, he\u0027s the man who created me. That\u0027s about all I know, but I need to put a stop to whatever he\u0027s planning now that the Facility housing myself was destroyed.\"\n\nShe buries her eyes with a hand, \"You\u0027re going to Tomas just so you can settle some vendetta?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly. The Father can also give me a, a purposed in my being. Right now I\u0027m a bloodsucker who\u0027s already hurt an innocent, but... I left someone who wanted me to continue down that path. I can use this curse for good by working with Tomas, get it?\"\n\nAt first, Alice\u0027s eyes widen at your collective statements, but ends up just spitting at you, \"That\u0027s stupid.\" She turns to leave, obviously irritated.\n",
  "page 104": "You raise your hands in surrender, though still maintain a defensive composure. \"Listen, Katar, I have no interest in fighting you. We can settle this dispute with less blood if you could listen to me.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you gave them,\" he eyes the corpses in the room, \"the same offer.\"\n\n\"They have no authority in the Church, and the only way to make us stop peacefully is to comply with our demands.\"\n\n\"We don\u0027t negotiate with terrorists,\" he smirks, though you feel as if he\u0027s telling you to continue.\n\n\"You need to let us live alongside you and the other humans in this city, and we promise we won\u0027t hurt you unless you persecute us. Simple, right?\"\n\n\"There is no rest for the wicked.\" He states, drawing his sword. Well, that didn\u0027t help.\n\nDavid just watches, seemingly sure in your chances and not wanting to get in your way while you fight. You set up a defensive stance, planting your feet to the ground and readying your hands at the sides. He, parallel to you, closes the door behind him, and then raises his sword, pointing it at you. \"So, you fear God?\"\n\n\"Not in yours.\" You laugh back, maintaining composure. He\u0027s trying to get me off-guard, that\u0027s what this mad-man wants.\n\n\"Then perhaps you find fear in his servants instead, fool. Why else would you not attack me before I ready my blade? Katar slowly approaches you, his long sword only a lunge away from your armored chest.\n\nYou don\u0027t feel the need to respond, instead focusing on his blade. You remember Kelso mentioning to you that you won\u0027t regenerate from silver-caused cuts, making this the most dangerous fight you\u0027ve been in, yet. You can only hope that after you survive this, you can make sure the Church doesn\u0027t have too much silver lying about. They probably have some idea of whether it works or not, otherwise Katar wouldn\u0027t have a silver katana.\n\nThe aloof Zealot chuckles, \"Then this will be an easy fight.\" He holds his sword with both hands, winds up, and swings it at your midsection, expecting you to duck and die. Thankfully, you saw through the ruse, and sidestep, only to slam the sword with your gauntlet out of Karat\u0027s hands. Angrily, he punches at you, sending a gauntleted fist at your nose. You get pushed back, but feel alright after rubbing it with your metal-covered wrist. You send a boot at the man\u0027s shins, making his knees bend, giving you perfect reach for swinging at his head. You feel his skull from under his skin after the blow, and the Zealot is pushed several meters away-- right next to his sword! Even though Karat is coughing blood, he gets up, using the sword as a cane.\n\n\"COME AT ME, DEMON!\" The bearded man yells, raising his word once more.\n\nYou shake your head, not falling for it. He angrily charges for you, only to be sucker-punched and knocked out before he could swing.\n\nYou stare at the man, then spit. \"This pathetic being is the Chief?\"\n\n\"Second in command, actually. Chief is probably fighting Gideon right now. But really, I don\u0027t think you realize how close you were to dying back there.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nDavid touches at your nose, \"I think his gauntlet is partly silver, so I don\u0027t think you\u0027re nose will fix itself.\"\n\nBoth of you laugh. If the worst thing that happens to us is that we get broken noses, then we\u0027re doing pretty good. \"So what now?\"\n\n\"Well, before the rest of the Zealots appear, we should probably try to kill Father Tomas, in the Church. Or, we could clear out this building while we--\"\n\n\"No, we need to finish our mission. The others will be able to deal with the remaining Zealots, easy.\"\n\nAt that very moment, sirens begin to blare, and red lights beam on-and-off all over the HQ...\n",
  "page 228": "\"Err, hey!\" You stutter, grabbing at her shoulder. Feeling your presence, she stops her exit long enough for you to continue speaking. After loosening your grip, you continue, \"Sorry about that, Alice, I... I won\u0027t go to Tomas. I\u0027m sure we can find a way to hide my-- my condition, right? Kill two birds with one rock-- or something.\"\n\nAlice finally turns to face you, wearing a weary smile and  a curiously thoughtful expression. Again, it appears like she was never even upset, \"We\u0027ll find a way, don\u0027t worry. Together I-- I think we can make this work, somehow...\"\n\nOvercome with feeling, you let her attempt to warm up beside you, only to slowly let go when she realizes how low your body temperature.\n\n\"We\u0027ll find a way.\" You repeat, perhaps trying to assure yourself more than her.\n\n\"R-right,\" she starts, after a moment of silence, \"well, Zadok won\u0027t be back until later, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll tell Tomas until later on after the talk we had, so we\u0027re safe. And-- and, Zadok has some clothes you can borrow, and you can join the Zealots as a civilian, for a long while, I\u0027d bet.\"\n\n\"Err, what exactly are you saying?\" You interrupt, trying to clarify what she means.\n\nShe grins, \"What do you think? You\u0027ll have to masquerade as a human. We can, um, introduce you as a refugee from the nomads or something. I\u0027ll do my research-- I\u0027m \u0027the\u0027 secretary, so accessing information like what you\u0027ll be wanting and more is pretty much at my disposal.\"\n\n\"So what will I be doing?\"\n\n\"Well, you\u0027ll have to be introduced into the community, as well as keep a profile low enough that Tomas won\u0027t really bother you...\"\n\n\"How often do you get \u0027refugees\u0027?\" You question, not really liking this part of the plan.\n\nShe bites her lip, \"Well, um, you\u0027re our first since the Devastation.\"\n\nFantastic. \"So you said you knew me-- know me-- whatever?\" You say, now attempting to understand your predicament as well as you can, \"I still can\u0027t wrap my head ver what happened. I don\u0027t remember much, but I certainly remember it not being this way. All desert...\"\n\nAlice rubs the back of her neck, \"It\u0027s... hard to explain. We were both young then, though you remain mostly unchanged. I wasn\u0027t really into the politics, but I remember it being rough. Terrorism worldwide, influenza, and some called bluffs in terms of nuclear warfare...\n\nAnd while religious opportunists were able to sway the blame on certain laws passed and repealed, \u0027science\u0027 came about once again to fix a solution. Dr. Kurschner created a program to fix the terrorism, stop disease, and rebuild after the oncoming nuclear devastation. That\u0027s where,\" she clears her throat, \"where you came in. Simon Kurschner\u0027s program involved genetic manipulation. This gained more traction than the religious response, which was against his program throughout. With government funding he made several facilities where he\u0027d more or less create super-soldiers, comic-book stuff, you know...\"\n\nYou notice that she almost seems like she\u0027s tearing for real now, \"It\u0027s alright, we can continue later, you know...\"\n\n\"No, I owe you this much.\" She says, wiping her face with a sleeve. \"But, while his Creations were successful-- as in they overcame the militant radicals and the disease, they soon broke loose. Some of them at least.\" She stops, \"But before that, you got hit in an accident, everything preserved, and He came...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath.\n\n\"But I suspect you never really died. You fell into a-- a coma, he said, that he said you would die in, so the bastard took you in and made you into...\" She begins prodding at your lifeless and clammy hands. \"Th-this... He was our he taught at the college, you know... He was such an absolutely sweet man. Somehow turned into such a horrible monster...\"\n\nAs she begins to babble, you put your hand back on her shoulder, \"So that\u0027s it, partly. Thanks for that, but... I really want to know more about, uh, me. There\u0027s so much I want to know about my past life, and you know it, don\u0027t you?\"\n\n\"I do.\" She says, grabbing your hand and taking it off of her, \"But I don\u0027t think you need to know it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The you you are now is you, silly.\" She giggles, \"It\u0027s not really something you should concern yourself about, just focus on your new history, the now.\"\n\nYou sigh, \"Well, can you at least tell me what my name is?\"\n\nShe laughs, \"You have the opportunity to begin anew... And I won\u0027t spoil that by giving you a label, dear. Your persona is your own, now.\"\n",
  "page 227": "Zadok cracks his neck; then he shrugs, \"Well, fine, I suppose. Evening just started, though, so and The Father is pretty big on late-night studying, so you\u0027ll have the night to think it over. I mean, he\u0027ll probably make an exception for a refugee like you, but it makes it easier to do it tomorrow, I guess. You know, Father Tomas is a saint, but he\u0027s really cool. Level-headed, down to earth, you know? Think about it, anyway.\"\n\nThe Zealot continues after a pause, \" Anyway, you want to, eat or something? And you gotta come up with a name, too weird to just refer to you by pointing, haha.\"\n\nYou give a weary chuckle, \"Yeah, I bet I\u0027ll come up with something. As for something to... Eat, you said?\" Human meat... \"No, not that...\" you mumble with a shiver.\n\n\"Huh?\" The Zealot looks behind himself before looking at you quizzically, \"Right. Well, Alice makes awesome tea, you know. Rare to find the right ingredients for it and hot water is hard to come by, so you\u0027d be lucky to get some of it.\" He pauses, \"But do you want some? Or, uh, you know-- something?\"\n\n\"Uh, no need, really. I\u0027m fine.\" Couldn\u0027t drink it anyway. I think?\n\n\"You sure?\" Zadok asks, his brows furrowing as he rubs his chin. \"Don\u0027t be shy man, I think you could use it more than the average person we help out. You look beat.\"\n\n\"Well... Alright.\" You comply with a frown. \"If you really want to, you know...\"\n\nHe gets up to give you a pat on the back, and then he leaves. You hear some discussion, but you can\u0027t exactly make it out. Several moments pass and you take the time to get up and stretch your limbs. It takes several twists and turns but eventually your forearms and legs relax to the point of being as spry as ever. Your mind wanders to several points; How long can I go on without blood? How much does Alice know about me? How am I going to hide my existence as a creature of the dead? And what is the Father going to do with me once I\u0027m in his clutches?\n\nYou take an unnecessary deep breath, your lungs not expanding or contracting as you do so, the air going in and out, straight. You take Zadok\u0027s seat near the door, waiting for the tea to be ready. What\u0027s taking so long?\n\nSoon later, you hear footsteps nearing your room. The long dark-haired Alice knocks on what you assume is some sort of post (as the door was left wide-open by Zadok) before entering. She takes a deep breath before handing you a modest cup of a dark red liquid with a wobbly hand, the other maintaining its spot near her waist.\n\n\"Thanks,\" you state, accepting it, though juggling whether you should drink it, still uncertain on how your anatomy works.\n\nAlice closes the door behind her, \"Don\u0027t worry, you can drink it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nHer voice is different than the ones you\u0027ve heard as of recently-- English, maybe? Either way, you\u0027ve decided it sounds rather pleasant. Just... Nice sounding. You notice her left hand clenching as she winces out, \"It... It\u0027s safe for you to drink the tea. Trust me.\"\n\nUncertain and more than just confused, you take a sip out of the tea. Once you swallow, you feel the familiar euphoria you had before, though admittedly watered down. She put blood in this, didn\u0027t she?\n\nYou look up, \"Alice, you know who I am? What happened to me? Please tell me!\"\n\n\"Zadok said he wants to take you to see Father Tomas. You... You can\u0027t...\" Alice continues, grasping at her hair.\n\n\"Why-- Why not?\"\n\n\"Father Tomas is our leader, and a good one! But...\"\n\n\"But what?\" You respond, getting up. You\u0027re not really sure what to do-- she\u0027s beginning to tear up...\n\n\"Just don\u0027t, please. He\u0027ll either kill you or use you, that\u0027s it!\"\n\n\"Use me? For what? What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe nears you, tears in her green eyes, placing her hands on your cheeks. \"If you promise to not meet him then I-- I\u0027ll tell you things abut the... The past. You don\u0027t need Tomas!\"\n\nFor whatever reason, you feel drawn to her. It\u0027s an unnatural feeling, and although you don\u0027t remember her at all, something about her makes you long for something of the past, though you\u0027re not sure what it is. Bottom line is, however, you have no idea what she\u0027s on about.\n\n\"Um, Alice, I never planned to go see him,\" you nervously chuckle. \"But, I mean, it\u0027s an interesting proposition, I guess. This Tomas guy, if anybody would know about the Professor...\"\n\nAlice looks like she was going to say something else, but instead just releases your face and asks, \"Who?\"\n\nYou sigh, \"You probably know him by some other moniker. But to me, he\u0027s the man who created me. That\u0027s about all I know, but I need to put a stop to whatever he\u0027s planning now that the Facility housing myself was destroyed.\"\n\nAlice\u0027s eyes brighten up, as if she never was crying in the first place, \"Oh! You don\u0027t need Tomas for that. I can help you find Kurschner... Probably... If he\u0027s still around... Maybe.\"\n\n\"Well...\" You take a deep breath, \"That\u0027s very, uh, kind of you, Alice. But how you you do that? Tomas leads this place, right? So he can help me. Maybe even give me a purpose of some sort. Somehow, you know about me and my... Needs, but he has the influence to have it used for good! He could help me fit in here, instead of having to hide myself from the world outside of the house.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m his secretary,\" she states, matter-of-factly, \"so I have access to pretty much everything he does and more.\"-- Right before turning around to leave in a huff.\n\nMaybe she can lead me to my past... She seems to know me, sort of. But Tomas seems like a much more... Stable(?) bet.\n",
  "page 55": "You hold pout your hand. \"Kelso, wait up.\"\n\nHe turns around, \"Found something already?\"\n\nYou look at David with an hungry grin, \"Not what we\u0027re looking for, but good enough.\" You raise your voice, \"David why don\u0027t you join us?\"\n\nThe Zealot\u0027s eyes go wide, as he shakes his head and repeatedly says, \"No.\" Over and over again. Kelso laughs, and slowly approaches the Zealot.\n\n\"What trap have you attempted to lure us to, son of the lord?\" The last bit dripping with sarcasm. You take an unfortunate step toward him, when it all goes black for a moment.\n\nYou find your ears deafening as you tumble forwards, firey mines exploding from beneath your feet. You run across the landscape, fire erupting all around. You eye the Zealot, angry, and noticing him running away and talking to his... fist? Shit, why didn\u0027t I take away his reciever?\n\nIt\u0027s too late now, and it doesn\u0027t take long to reach the coward, but among this you find yourself looking on the optimistic side; if you didn\u0027t catch it earlier, who knew what would happen?\n\nBut you still fear what will happen now. You sprint behind him, barely overtaking him even with your flayed legs. You flick out your wrist, and throw your arm at him, your body almost falling with pain and missing him by an inch or so. Determined, you continue the arm motion, turning your arm around your body once again, twisting your body in a circle, gaining just enough momentum to slam your clawed hand at the back of his head. You feel his brain hitting the back of his head as he slumps to the sand, dead as can be.\n\nYou look around; Kelso is nowhere to be found. Your body feeling heavy, you realize that Zealots are approaching from afar, and you suddenly black out again, probably due to the heat...\n",
  "page 54": "Odd. \"Alrighty then...\" You mutter,  searching the ground for any sort of opening. Several moments later you hear a boom as sand is pit at the back of your head, as well as the vague sound of someone screaming... Kelso?\n\nSon of a bitch...\n\n\"IT\u0027S A TRAP!\" You manage to yell out before something horribly metal clamps on to your leg. \"You\u0027re going to die for this, David!\" You call out, though he\u0027s already limping away.\n\nShit, he probably still has a transceiver... As you leg heals enough to get unstuck from the clamp, you begin to sprint through the field of traps, mines exploding as you trigger them. Several burn your feet, but others give you just enough momentum...\n\nYou leap, easily catching up to the lying coward, and ruthlessly digging into the back of his skull with the momentum of the jump and the sharp ends of your gauntleted fingers, killing him almost instantly when you feel the mushy part inside (the brain?). Thirsty, again, you drink from the blood pouring from his head, barely realizing one of your feet were blown off in the explosion! Once you realize it, you begin to cough out all the blood you slurped in shock, unsure what to do. You see Kelso muttering in the distance, running away with more success than you are.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t take too long before the Zealots arrive, catching you red-handed, and finishing you off with several bursts of lightning.\n\n\nYou have died by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 229": "You breathe in to begin speaking, but the only thing you let out is what you just breathed in; Alice leaves your room. You stand in silence, somewhat assured that you are making the correct, most reasonable choice-- and yet, you feel somewhat put-off by what just happened. You take a seat and meditate-- a technique you\u0027ve found to be particularly useful to pass time, as well as to clear your head.\n\nPerhaps an hour passes when you hear another knock on your door. \"Hey man,\" comes a whisper, \"It\u0027s Zadok, you ready to go?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" You look around, unsure what you could really bring. \"I think so. Can I meet the Father with this hoodie?\"\n\n\"Keep your voice down!.. And yeah, I guess.\"\n\nYou sigh, getting up out of your chair and calmly nodding to Zadok. \"Is the Father expecting us?\"\n\n\"Not... Exactly. Alice wasn\u0027t very happy when I told her you were coming with me to meet him for some reason. I guess she talked to you about it too?\"\n\n\"Y-yeah.\"\n\n\"Care telling me what it was about?\"\n\n\"Uh, I guess she didn\u0027t want Father Tomas to bother me while I was recovering.\" You white-lie, still unsure how to tackle the fact that while you wish to repent; the Zealots probably wouldn\u0027t be too happy knowing that your existence contradicts their way of life.\n\n\"Hmm, I think she likes you,\" Zadok chuckles. \"Guess you feel better, then?\"\n\n\"Sort of, but mostly I just really want to meet Father Tomas. I think that, if anybody, he\u0027d be able to fill me in on what\u0027s happening.\"\n\n\"Good thinking, Now, let\u0027s get going.\"\n\nYou leave for the outdoors, only to find the dull City looming over you in the moon-light. Each house a grayer variation of the other, bland and gloomy. The only color comes from flashy neon-lights which unnecessarily labeled the various buildings, as well as serve as markers for the street. As you follow Zadok through several arrays of gray buildings, you pass several unoccupied stands with signs depicting fruit, the pink-neon lights flashing, \"MARKET\".\n\nYou continue, until you come across two parallel buildings- both the largest in the City. One has a giant neon Cross, flashing through the night on its face, separating two powerful metal doors; and the other with an upside-down blue Cross, the doors also stainless steel.\n\n\"That there is the Zealot Head Quarters,\" Zadok points out, noticing your confusion on the upside-down Cross. \"It shows how we have to sometimes twist the Holy Word if we are to preserve it. It\u0027s an unfortunate truth, but our Sword of God is just. Sometimes we have to kill-- even if it\u0027s forbidden, we need to defend ourselves. Get it?\"\n\nYou nod, realizing that that\u0027s how they must justify slaughtering Creations, like Kelso mentioned. I wonder what\u0027s up with that bastard... And now that I think about it, I wonder how much of what he said is true.\n\n\"And that\u0027s the Main Church, where Father Tomas and his monks live. That\u0027s where we\u0027ll be going. Got any questions?\"\n",
  "page 57": "An extremely... Blue, room is what you wake up to. Very bright, to the point you have to squint to make anything out. Worst of all, your skin begins to get irritated, and your efforts to get out of the chair seem to be futile. You scream, but your muscles seem to be neutralized. You simply can\u0027t get up.\n\n\"UV-lightning, like it?\" Says a robed figure, appearing out of an opening of the wall. You hear a clanking noise and steam rises when the opening is closed, making the opening close, the room is glows with the calming blue. The robe the priest is wearing is also blue, with white stripes. You notice, from a slight creak in his robes, that he has some sort of shiny sword in there. For whatever reason, you feel it from several meters away, your stomach hurting. \"Don\u0027t worry, that just means that it\u0027s working. You demons can\u0027t afford to be in the sun, so the closest thing to it would logically bother you in some way.\"\n\nYou notice that the bearded holyman, complete with a large blue skullcap, is terribly... Old. It\u0027s surprising he can move so much, with his crooked back and pruned face, the odd sort of shuffling he does to get closer to you is unnerving.\n\nNoticing you not retorting, he continues, \"Ah, but where are my manners? I, am Father Tomas.\" It takes a couple of minutes, but he manages to get hand-distance away from you. You struggle to even spit at the man, the lights dominating your will. He takes your hand in his, and shakes it against your will. \"So, what\u0027s your name?\"\n",
  "page 59": "\"I honestly don\u0027t know.\" You reply to the voice, \"But who are you?\"\n\nThe blue room begins to make funny, scratching noises. Then, the sound of clinking; gears shifting, and a part of the room turns backwards, revealing an opening. Out of it, and elderly man with a flowing white beard, skullcap and robe comes out. \"My apologies,\" His gravely, but strong voice speaks out, \"I am the founder of the Church and retired Zealot.\" As he says this, a hatch in the floor is cranked open, allowing space for an odd chair to form out. \"May I take a seat?\"\n\nYou lick your lips. Still some blood on them, you would have thought the assholes be kind enough to wash you, but apparently not. Seeing you not respond, the Father takes a seat. \"So,\" He begins, \"You don\u0027t remember... Anything? How have you been surviving alone? You\u0027re young.\"\n\nYou nod. \"No. I woke up when your \u0027Zealots\u0027 destroyed teh Facility. I\u0027m lucky I made it out alive, with your dogs burning it down. I had a mentor, though you likely got him as well...\"\n\n\"There are two unlisted Creations? Fascinating.\" He strokes his beard, \"The burning of the facility was necessary. Not that you\u0027d know, you\u0027re in the dark, I believe.\"\n\nYou find this funny, though not untrue. \"And you\u0027re about to enlighten me?\"\n\nTomas nods, \"Then end your suffering, through any means necessary.\"\n\n\"So I\u0027m going to die by the end of this?\"\n\n\"Of course. Though there\u0027s always the option of cooperating. Even the saints needed the devils to do their bidding. Sometimes.\" He smiles.\n\n\"I\u0027m not some sort of \u0027devil\u0027.\" You reply, bewildered, \"Why do you suppose that?\"\n\n\"You like stories, yes? Because there is a necessary one here, one that you probably never heard of.\"\n\nHead shaking, you motion for him to carry on.\n\n\"For being such a good sport, I\u0027ll cut out the dramatic parts and just get to the real \u0027beef\u0027\" He states, his eyes trained on yours. He coughs, spewing out dots of mucus in your direction, then does it again. WIth his throat now cleared, Father Tomas begins his tale.\n\n\"The world two decades ago was a much different place. Lush greens were the equivalent of sand today; everywhere you looked, there was grass. Huge cities, several miles in circumference, were common place. Buildings reaching the clouds and mods of transport like griffons, soaring high above. Religion, ironically, was considerably less widespread, and it continued to dwindle as so-called \u0027science\u0027 led many astray. As evil was legalized, sodomy and murder-rates soon became more and more consistent and the government fell to anarchy as horrible diseases began to spread. Militant radicals spread throughout the globe, raping and pillaging. At the time, to those who were looking, it was obvious that this was God\u0027s Reckoning; his flood to bring about a New Age. That\u0027s where Simon Kurschner\u0027s Creations came into play. With government support, he tried to find a way to get out of the apocalypse, not realizing it was God\u0027s will, it couldn\u0027t be stopped. But he tried, and he received the funding to do whatever he wanted, with hopes of stopping the plague, and creating beings who could stop the barbarians. He took the dead and dying, experimenting on them and trying to create slaves. There is no doubt in my mind he did things that weren\u0027t legal, but that didn\u0027t matter to them. As long as he saved us, he could go against the Lord\u0027s will, using humans as guinea pigs, and secretly trying to make for himself perfect slaves. Kurschner created many different sorts of entities, and for the next several years he was a beacon of hope for the non-believers. But we, the Church, we knew what was coming. The Creations were immune to disease, and had a fighting prowess unmatched by the strongest armies in the world. One Creation could destroy hundreds of Radicals with minimal effort, and it seemed like this would fix everything, but hell on Earth stayed. Even after the threats were stopped, the Creations and their Leader wanted more. They began to kill indiscriminately, with an attempt to rule the world.\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath, trying to remember, \"As God decreed, the Earth began to decay in the demons\u0027 wake. While Doctor Kurschner ruled his legions from hell, a few of us banded together. The Church was the new Ark; we banded together to maintain what\u0027s left of humanity. IT was hard, but we suceeded, with several towns in the Northern United States. But the demons still linger, and it is our duty to destroy what God intended to not let live.\n\n\"Because that\u0027s is what you are!\" He raises his voice, shaking his fists angrily at your helpless self on the chair, \"You were supposed to stay dead, like the rest of the infected. But you were given life, and now are doomed to live a cursed life because of that Doctor. That is why the Church will destroy all the Creations that are still roaming the Earth.\"\n\n\"But they\u0027re still human!\" You interrupt, pointing to yourself, \"I\u0027m still human.\"\n\nThe Priest continues, as if not hearing you, \"However... It isn\u0027t your fault. Perhaps that\u0027s why I\u0027m giving you this chance, a chance at a redemption, of sorts. After the men you\u0027ve killed, there is nothing I can do to save your unlife, but perhaps you can still find favor with the Lord... Undercover.\"\n",
  "page 58": "\"A heathen, no doubt.\" You manage to spit out, angrily.\n\n\"Not a heathen, an abomination. There is a difference.\" The voice is male, and older. \"But I don\u0027t wish to quell your anger, as you are no doubt misguided. Worry not, we shall end your suffering.\"\n\n\"Thanks, I wouldn\u0027t want to be a burden.\"\n\nHe laughs. \"You are a funny devil alright, but one who deserves an explanation, if he wants one.\" Gears grind, causing your ears to sting while a shaft opens up in the blue room. An old man in a priestly garb and a skullcap comes out, an inviting though intimidating aura around him. \"Do you wish to know why you\u0027re here? What the Church\u0027s mission is?\"\n\nYou stare at the man. \"What\u0027s the point if you\u0027re just going to kill me right after?\"\n\n\"Us antagonists like our monologs, do we not? You\u0027d know, for I am only part of the lesser evil. So, if you please, allow me to explain why the verdict is so grim for one with such oratory abilities, like yourself.\"\n\nYou nod to the bizarre old man, \"Sure... But not before you tell me where my mentor is.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Kelso.\"\n\n\"Doesn\u0027t ring any bells. Can we go on?\" He says, looking at his watch.\n\nHe\u0027s not even wearing a watch! You sigh, \"You really want to tell me the story then, huh.\"\n\nThe pruned holy-man beams, \"Why yes!\"\n\nA long pause erupts. And you wait for the priest to tell you. He begins to cough, and cough... By now you\u0027re just irked, stuck in a room with a senile wackjob. It\u0027s surprising that he\u0027s your interrogator. \"So.\"\n\n\"Ah yes. On the first day,\" His large dark eyes twinkle, \"of the new Era, the world began to sink. Horrible diseases and militant radicals swept through different parts of the globe. Coincidentally, this all began after marriage became void and immorality was embraced.\" He shakes his head, \"Regardless, Simon Kurschner created his Program, with the government\u0027s support, and using the dead and dying as test subjects, he claimed that he wished to stop disease and create perfect soldiers as well. At the time, it sounded ludicrous; like a comic book. But the world governments were desperate, and he received the funding. The second day was much darker, with the disease spreading rapidly before Kurschner\u0027s lab was even finished. By the time it was done, he petitioned for less regulation, and that\u0027s when it began. There would be no stopping what he began to create. Worse than the viruses which wiped out humanity; a God\u0027s flood. This... you, are different, unnatural. Third day came and Simon sent a crew of his deathless zombies, which survived the disease under his care, to deal with military conflicts all over the world. The fact that it succeeded so well was a curse, as he gained more support. By the 4rth day he had thousands of Creations under his disposal. And who didn\u0027t trust him? The religious, the so-called \u0027supersticious\u0027 Church.\" He spits, getting emotional during his obviously summarized tale, \"5th Day, his Creations began fighting against the world, rather than with them against evil. One experiment could take on hundreds of regular soldiers alone, and so they laid waste, all while Simon was living the good life. Then, what do you know, the diseases evolved, went airborn, killed everyone but the faithful, those who stayed in the First Chapel. The Earth was dying, as God didn\u0027t want it to continue as it did, and only two groups survived; the Zealots, and the Creations. The next day involved war. W wanting to e slowly began building society back up, getting stronger technology and a bigger community. But it was not enough, and the Creations spread us weak and thin. But we\u0027re growing, and the Creations are now on the run, no doubt split between wanting to kill us or the Professor, who got them into this mess. Everything with them is \u0027kill\u0027, for they are demon-spawn.\u0027\u0027\n\nHe notices your eyese rolling and then bends down to your level, \"Look at you, boy, blood on his lips and unrelenting anger. This is mercy, to end your cursed life. As now, on the 7th day, we shall put all of the cursed to rest. They may resist, but we will go out of our way to end them.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, taking all of this in. There isn\u0027t that much to say, and you realize how much fragments you still don\u0027t know. There has to be more to this, though you\u0027re not sure why...\n\n\"Dramatic, no?\" He nods, continuing. \"Which makes me wonder where you fit into all of this. You don\u0027t have a name do you?\"\n\n\"Uh, no, I can\u0027t remember anything from before my awakening.\"\n\nThe Father frowned, \"Hmm, you must have been one of the last experiments if you\u0027re so young. Very well then, good night, I\u0027m afraid. May God have mercy on your soul...\" He turns to leave.\n\n\"Wait, you\u0027re killing me after all that?!? Come back here! I\u0027m sentient, I\u0027m human, just like YOU!\" You yell, struggling at the immobile chair.\n\nHe doesn\u0027t answer. A quick, firey death unexpectedly follows, your seat spewing out bursts of flame, charring through your body and burning your soul to a crisp. Red, then all black.\n\n\nYou have died by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 51": "Shrugging the thought of not having Kelso around, you collect the armors of the Zealots, turning the flash off and equipping them. They won\u0027t save you from everything, but they will certainly make you physical attacks stronger, if only because they\u0027re reinforced by cold metal. You wear everything but the helmet, since you like having your vision unrestricted. Kelso does similarly, putting on the armor, leggings, and boots. You also decide to take one of the undamaged rifles; good weapons, and more effective on humans than on Creations, ironically.\n\nAfter the slight diversion, you bring your attention to the rousing Zealot. Kelso points him out to you to deal with. With a cruel smile, you walk over to him, bringing your gauntleted hand to his armored helmet, and begin to squeeze.\n\nThat wakes him up.\n\nHe cries in agony, as his helmet soon becomes a \u0027custom-fit\u0027 of sorts. With your one hand, you pick him up by his face, and just hold him in mid-air. \"Kelso, are we just interrogating him here or somewhere else?\"\n\n\"Here\u0027s fine.\"\n\nYou shrug, and drop the Zealot on the floor. He groans in pain, bringing hands to his face to try to take off his helmet; he couldn\u0027t do it. \"Tell you what, if I take off your new skullcap if you tell me where the other Creations are.\"\n\nHe looks up pitifully, nodding. Carefully... You peel off the horned helmet from his visage.\n\n\"You killed Sebastian, didn\u0027t you!\" Is the first thing that erupts from his lips. That, and some spit. You back hand him, bloodying his face further and causing him to fall back onto the sand.\n\n\"Location, now. Or you end up having a worse fate than Sebastian.\"\n\nThe dark haired Zealots looks at you with menacing eyes, \"I don\u0027t consort with demons. I will die with honor.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s not what you were saying when your face was in a can.\" You laugh, and Kelso gets on one knee, beckoning closer to him.\n\n\"You can become one of us, if you like. Be one of the damned, and survive the hell that is God\u0027s world. Just lead us to where the so-called \u0027Wolves\u0027 are.\"\n\n\"I won\u0027t sell out that easy, demon. Sebastian was a brother before you bastards killed him!\" The agitated cripple would be somewhat intimidating if he wasn\u0027t in such a pathetic situation.\n\n\"Then it\u0027s time you became family.\" Kelso looks at you. \"Try ghouling him.\"\n\nYour eyes widen, \"What do you mean, \u0027ghoul\u0027?\"\n\n\"Drink from him until he has only the minimum amount of blood he needs. He\u0027ll become one of us. Well, half. He\u0027ll also follow our commands in that state. For the first couple of days. An eternal slave.\" Your mentor grins. The Zealot, however, is horrified.\n\n\"No, don\u0027t! Don\u0027t drink from me, I\u0027ll get you to the Wolves, I promise! I\u0027ll even tell you when the Church is to attack their base. Everything, just don\u0027t turn me into one of you! Stop!\"\n\n\nOh, so very tempting. But kind of... Evil, is it? Is there even a line anymore, after what I\u0027ve done? Kindness will only hurt you at this point, and a side-kick if Kelso ever leaves is tempting...\n",
  "page 50": "\"Err, uh, yeah. Let\u0027s try my other plan.\"\n\nKelso laughs. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"Hey, both of my plans were better than your\u0027s.\" You argue, setting the dial back to where it was. Now that you think about it, you wonder why the Church never went out looking for the Zealot which your mentor killed, and you killed. Perhaps they did, just you and Kelso never noticed it. Or perhaps the Zealots often went out in long journeys without communication.\n\nNo matter now, You realize, they\u0027ll pick up at the signal. Somebody will.\n\nExcitedly, you fidget for the WT, and grasp it firmly. You clear your throat to speak, but Kelso briefs you.\n\n\"Remember, just put the channel on. Listen in and wait for a while, and if nothing turns up then try speaking. But only then.\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"It might.\"\n\nYou cough again, then breathe in. Out. In.\n\nYou put the dial back to where it was in the first place.\n\nOut. Nothing but static, for now. Minutes go by. You stand at the ready. But all is static. Ten minutes turns to half an hour, though your body doesn\u0027t stop tensing. Something is coming.\n",
  "page 53": "\"I\u0027ll have mercy on you now, Zealot. But don\u0027t even dare try to cross me.\" You state, giving him the evil eye. He noticeably gulps, then nods. Kelso rubs at his chin, probably thinking about the other Creations. Your mentor likely knows the head of the Wolves, but if you\u0027d guess that there is some sort of bad-blood between them. God knows what.\n\n\"So, what\u0027s your name?\" You ask, trying to make communication easier.\n\n\"David, sir.\" David starts, getting onto his own two feet. \"David Crowe... Son of the Lord.\"\n\nYou sigh, \"Cut the bullshit, \u0027Dave\u0027. Tell us all you know about the Wolves.\"\n\nThe Zealot tenses, as if worried about something. \"I... The Wolves are on the other side of the Dunes, from where we are, we need to just go straight past the City, go several miles down East, and then search for a burrow, of sorts.\"\n\nKelso raises an eyebrow, \"What is the Church planning to do? If they know such an  exact location, they must be planning on doing something.\"\n\nDavid nods, \"Yeah, the Church is planning on raiding the burrow, taking them by s confused.urprise and purifying them.\"\n\n\"Purification?\" You ask, confused.\n\nHe rolls his swollen eye, \"Death by burning. It is said that you abominations will be going to hell, but by burning your soul is destroyed, so you won\u0027t suffer. Unlike you two bastards, the Church keeps the World To Come in mind!\" Kelso pushes him forward.\n\n\"Lead then.\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath, and leads you through the desert, passing the City that never stops flashing, and moving from there right. As you make the treacherously long walk, you notice the sun begin to rise. \"Kelso! Do you still have the lotion?\"\n\nHe nods, looking like he\u0027s glad you remembered. David chuckles nervously while you lather the lotion on your face, the only uncovered part of your body. Even while the sun reflects it\u0027s light off of your creamy-white head, you feel your skin itch. The lotion is definitely something to get used to. MAybe you could get a hat later so this wouldn\u0027t be as much of a problem.\n\nYou, Kelso, and David find the spot. At least, the spot David brought you to.\n\n\"So, where\u0027s the pit?\" You call out, beginning to search around the area for it with Kelso.\n\nDavid stays behind, \"It should be there, somewhere.\"\n",
  "page 52": "Curious, and perhaps a wee bit thirsty, you motion to the Zealot. \"What\u0027s your name?\"\n\n\"David.\" He spits, \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because your new name is... Slave.\" His eyes widen in horror as you sink your teeth into his soft and milky flesh, this time getting it on the artery. The blood squirts down your throat, and the high that you get is unimaginable. Sweet and slightly sour blood, like apple-juice. The euphoria you get is uplifting, and you feel... Happy. Power surges through your veins, and your stomach does happy somersaults as it absorbs all the nutrients from the Zealot\u0027s warrior-blood, and you continue chewing on his neck, trying to get as much as you can from this man before he falters. Just sublime...\n\n\"Goddammit kid, your mother must have been some sort of an abuser.\" Kelso says with a chuckle, pulling you away. \"But I think that\u0027 enough drinking, your new slave is deathly pale, but still breathing, albeit very slowly and inconsistently-- a sign that you\u0027ve drunk just enough.\" He points out, \"But hats off to you kid, you\u0027ve got yourself a ghoul.\"\n\nYou both stand, waiting for your slave to wake. The pale Zealot opens his eyes back up, a glossy look to them. He doesn\u0027t speak, but instead lazily lets saliva and a red substance that likely is blood ooze out from the side of his mouth.\n\nNervously, you command him, \"Lead us to the Wolves hideout.\" He lazily tries to get up, only to fall back down again. \"Now.\" Firm. He gets up, straight this time. With uncoordinated steps he begins to march, stumbling through the sand and skin beginning to redden from the sun. You shrug, and follow your new ghoul. By the time you pass the City the trek is already nearly over. You take another left from there, then a turn to the right... And soon Kelso directs you and your new slave to stop.\n\n\"This,\" he begins, \"is where I take my leave.\"\n\n\"What?\" You exclaim, \"Why now? Didn\u0027t you say that the other Creations might be on the Professor\u0027s side?\"\n\nKelso tilts his head to the side, \"The longer I think about it, the less it makes sense. But I\u0027ve been worried about something, and I\u0027m nigh certain I\u0027m correct on this.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nYour mentor walks to your ghoul, tugging at his armor\u0027s sleeve to get attention, \"You, David, what does the Church know about Simon Kurschner?\" Who?\n\nThe slave replies in monotone, \"Can\u0027t be found or traced. Not among Creations, unknown if even still alive.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, \"Who\u0027s this Kurschner?\"\n\n\"The Professor.\" Comes the reply from Kelso.\n\n\"But I thought our plan was to see if the other Creations know where the Professor is? Which could mean that they still serve him. Or not.\"\n\n\"Exactly. If the Church has no idea of his whereabouts, then it\u0027s unlikely the Wolves have something definite either. Even though the Wolf and I have had our  arguments, I still trust him enough to give you vacancy while I search for the Professor.\"\n\n\"So where are you going?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. The world left is just a desert, and traveling by night only will waste time, which is why we have t split for the moment.\" Kelso frowns, and holds out his hand to shake.\n\nYou firmly grasp it, \"Then stay safe, Master. I trust you will return soon?\"\n\nHe stares at you blankly, \"I have no idea how long it will take. But I believe in you just as well. You can make it on your own, especially with how you proved yourself today. Strong decision making and vast knowledge on how survival works have made you to what you are. There is very little that I can teach you that I even know. You shall grow past what I can even guess you can do.\" He begins to let go of the hand shake, but you hold on.\n\nTightly. \"There\u0027s one thing that you still haven\u0027t told me.\"\n\n\"And what\u0027s that?\"\n\n\"How the World came to this pitiful state.\"\n",
  "page 110": "\"David, finish off these grunts as I find the big man upstairs.\" You call out, examining the building for the Father\u0027s Quarters.\n\nDavid nods, \"Up the stairs, to the left!\"\n\nYour head turns from right to left, looking for the set of stairs that will lead you to the Father. Finding the red-carpeted stairs, you begin your ascent, only to be stopped by a heavy-set Monk, who angrily shoves you backwards. \"Get away, foul demon!\"\n\nHe continues pushing, but you catch his left arm, and end squeeze-- Crack. He yells out in pain, and you manage to grab him by the cuff of his robe, only to throw him out of the way and into a wall. You run up the staircase, skipping steps to maintain speed. After reaching the end of the first staircase, you deftly,turn your body, not wasting any time by getting to the adjacent continuation of the stairs. Several leaps later, you reach the end of the stair case, only to be confronted by a terribly old man in a ceremonial blue robe, with a skullcap covering his no doubt balding head. His face is withered, and his frail eyes only compliment an extremely happy demeanor. This, you presume, is Father Tomas.\n\nHe stares at you, silent, and raises a large metallic cross from an opening of his robe, though he seems to be holding it the wrong way...\n\nWary of his silver weapon, you take a step to the side-- giving you room. \"Father Tomas, it seems that I have finally had the honor to meet you.\"\n\n\"No, the pleasure is mine, Vampire. Fate has brought it that it is my responsibility to put you down, as well as your canine friends.\"\n\nYou glare at him in anger, and flick at your wrist; claws out, you get into a battle-stance. He, in turn, raises his shimmering Cross, wielding it as a sword.\n\n\"I wouldn\u0027t put up a fight, if I were you. I know for a fact that you Creations can\u0027t heal from a wound of silver, and as such you have no otherworldly advantage over me.\"\n\nYou laugh, \"Except perhaps the age part.\"\n\nThe priest stops smiling and instead eyes you angrily, \"I suppose you\u0027ll learn the hard way.\" He slowly begins to approach you, his sword, pulsating with some sort of unrecognizable energy, held high. You make a quick examination of your surroundings: the stair case from behind you, doors and other hallways to your right, though several meters forward and to your left is a ledge, where there\u0027s an at least three-story drop down to the first floor, where you can see David slowly whittling off the Monks. Perhaps you can use the ledge to your advantage...\n\nYou continue to parallel the insane priest, your claws at your side and your wits still intact. You need to make the first move, but how should you go about it? The man looks old, but something about him tells you that he\u0027s more than capable of wielding his weapon masterfully. Still, you\u0027re probably quicker than him, and a quick fight is all you need. Then again, you need to watch out for the silver sword, because if he gets a solid hit on you then you\u0027re done.\n",
  "page 231": "\"Err, hey!\" You stutter, grabbing at her shoulder. Feeling your presence, she stops her exit long enough for you to continue speaking. After loosening your grip, you continue, \"Sorry about that, Alice, I... I won\u0027t go to Tomas. I\u0027m sure we can find a way to hide my-- my condition, right? Kill two birds with one rock-- or something.\"\n\nAlice finally turns to face you, wearing a weary smile and  a curiously thoughtful expression. Again, it appears like she was never even upset, \"We\u0027ll find a way, don\u0027t worry. Together I-- I think we can make this work, somehow...\"\n\nOvercome with feeling, you let her attempt to warm up beside you, only to slowly let go when she realizes how low your body temperature.\n\n\"We\u0027ll find a way.\" You repeat, perhaps trying to assure yourself more than her.\n\n\"R-right,\" she starts, after a moment of silence, \"well, Zadok won\u0027t be back until later, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll tell Tomas until later on after the talk we had, so we\u0027re safe. And-- and, Zadok has some clothes you can borrow, and you can join the Zealots as a civilian, for a long while, I\u0027d bet.\"\n\n\"Err, what exactly are you saying?\" You interrupt, trying to clarify what she means.\n\nShe grins, \"What do you think? You\u0027ll have to masquerade as a human. We can, um, introduce you as a refugee from the nomads or something. I\u0027ll do my research-- I\u0027m \u0027the\u0027 secretary, so accessing information like what you\u0027ll be wanting and more is pretty much at my disposal.\"\n\n\"So what will I be doing?\"\n\n\"Well, you\u0027ll have to be introduced into the community, as well as keep a profile low enough that Tomas won\u0027t really bother you...\"\n\n\"How often do you get \u0027refugees\u0027?\" You question, not really liking this part of the plan.\n\nShe bites her lip, \"Well, um, you\u0027re our first since the Devastation.\"\n\nFantastic. \"So you said you knew me-- know me-- whatever?\" You say, now attempting to understand your predicament as well as you can, \"I still can\u0027t wrap my head ver what happened. I don\u0027t remember much, but I certainly remember it not being this way. All desert...\"\n\nAlice rubs the back of her neck, \"It\u0027s... hard to explain. We were both young then, though you remain mostly unchanged. I wasn\u0027t really into the politics, but I remember it being rough. Terrorism worldwide, influenza, and some called bluffs in terms of nuclear warfare...\n\nAnd while religious opportunists were able to sway the blame on certain laws passed and repealed, \u0027science\u0027 came about once again to fix a solution. Dr. Kurschner created a program to fix the terrorism, stop disease, and rebuild after the oncoming nuclear devastation. That\u0027s where,\" she clears her throat, \"where you came in. Simon Kurschner\u0027s program involved genetic manipulation. This gained more traction than the religious response, which was against his program throughout. With government funding he made several facilities where he\u0027d more or less create super-soldiers, comic-book stuff, you know...\"\n\nYou notice that she almost seems like she\u0027s tearing for real now, \"It\u0027s alright, we can continue later, you know...\"\n\n\"No, I owe you this much.\" She says, wiping her face with a sleeve. \"But, while his Creations were successful-- as in they overcame the militant radicals and the disease, they soon broke loose. Some of them at least.\" She stops, \"But before that, you got hit in an accident, everything preserved, and He came...\"\n\nYou take a deep breath.\n\n\"But I suspect you never really died. You fell into a-- a coma, he said, that he said you would die in, so the bastard took you in and made you into...\" She begins prodding at your lifeless and clammy hands. \"Th-this... He was our he taught at the college, you know... He was such an absolutely sweet man. Somehow turned into such a horrible monster...\"\n\nAs she begins to babble, you put your hand back on her shoulder, \"So that\u0027s it, partly. Thanks for that, but... I really want to know more about, uh, me. There\u0027s so much I want to know about my past life, and you know it, don\u0027t you?\"\n\n\"I do.\" She says, grabbing your hand and taking it off of her, \"But I don\u0027t think you need to know it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The you you are now is you, silly.\" She giggles, \"It\u0027s not really something you should concern yourself about, just focus on your new history, the now.\"\n\nYou sigh, \"Well, can you at least tell me what my name is?\"\n\nShe laughs, \"You have the opportunity to begin anew... And I won\u0027t spoil that by giving you a label, dear. Your persona is your own, now.\"\n",

Now, you will be fed every once in a while, we have some animals out back that you can feast from, if you want. But you certainly won\u0027t be getting human blood, haha.\"\n\nRegardless of your reasons for accepting the devil\u0027s bargain, you can\u0027t help but find him horribly irritating currently. You sigh, realizing that the only thing you can look forward to this week is the blandly colored room and the sneering priest. \"Goodbye, then, Vampire of the Light.\"\n\nThe priest happily shuffles away into the clinking gear-based doors, and your mind wanders...\n\nDays pass, and you\u0027d be lying if you said that you weren\u0027t surprised that the withered old geezer wasn\u0027t mentoring you himself. Of course, this makes sense-- the rest of the Church would probably lynch him if he declared you \u0027AOK\u0027, but it\u0027s more surprising how spry the man is. He spends the next few days teaching you boring protocol, not-as-boring use of standardized C.E. weaponry, and a quick, refined crash-course through some-sort of martial art. Surprisingly, he doesn\u0027t bother you with the gospel of the Zealots, but you\u0027re too busy working on yourself in order to reflect on that.\n\nWithin a week, he manages to transform you into what he thinks is a Creation killing machine. And it\u0027s then when he reveals the plan you were already somewhat familiar with. \"It is necessary that we raid the Wolf hideout, and completely eliminate the Wolf threat once and for all, when they least expect it. We have found their coordinates, finally,\" he hands you a tablet, showing a mapping of the surrounding desert, \"And can now make sure they can no longer harm themselves or anyone else anymore. So, Vampire-Of-Light, do you think you\u0027re ready to take on the Demons, as is your holy mission?\"\n\n\"Sir, yes sir!\"\n\nHe grins, then outfits you with standard Zealot equipment; armor, rifle, and various gadgets used for communication.\n\n\"Now just wait here while I get the rest of the Zealots ready. Tonight, you will banish the evil in our own backyards! Godspeed, soldier.\" With that, he leaves, finally leaving you alone.\n\nAh, the open air and the cold night sky. Beautiful in many ways, and-- wait, I\u0027m outside! I can run away from this place! I can\u0027t believe they\u0027re letting me out unsupervised like this...\n",
  "page 219": "In that desolate land and lone,\n\nWhere the Big Horn and Yellowstone\n\nRoar down their mountain path,\n\nBy their fires the Sioux Chiefs\n\nMuttered their woes and griefs\n\nAnd the menace of their wrath. \n\n\n\"Revenge!\" cried Rain-in-the-Face,\n\n\"Revenue upon all the race\n\nOf the White Chief with yellow hair!\"\n\nAnd the mountains dark and high\n\nFrom their crags re-echoed the cry\n\nOf his anger and despair. \n\n\nIn the meadow, spreading wide\n\nBy woodland and riverside\n\nThe Indian village stood;\n\nAll was silent as a dream,\n\nSave the rushing a of the stream\n\nAnd the blue-jay in the wood. \n\n\nIn his war paint and his beads,\n\nLike a bison among the reeds,\n\nIn ambush the Sitting Bull\n\nLay with three thousand braves\n\nCrouched in the clefts and caves,\n\nSavage, unmerciful! \n\n\nInto the fatal snare\n\nThe White Chief with yellow hair\n\nAnd his three hundred men\n\nDashed headlong, sword in hand;\n\nBut of that gallant band\n\nNot one returned again. \n\n\nThe sudden darkness of death\n\nOverwhelmed them like the breath\n\nAnd smoke of a furnace fire:\n\nBy the river\u0027s bank, and between\n\nThe rocks of the ravine,\n\nThey lay in their bloody attire. \n\n\nBut the foemen fled in the night,\n\nAnd Rain-in-the-Face, in his flight\n\nUplifted high in air\n\nAs a ghastly trophy, bore\n\nThe brave heart, that beat no more,\n\nOf the White Chief with yellow hair. \n\n\nWhose was the right and the wrong?\n\nSing it, O funeral song,\n\nWith a voice that is full of tears,\n\nAnd say that our broken faith\n\nWrought all this ruin and scathe,\n\nIn the Year of a Hundred Years.\n\n\n-Henry W. Longfellow\n",
  "page 218": "Before us great Death stands\n\nOur fate held close within his quiet hands.\n\nWhen with proud joy we lift Life’s red wine\n\nTo drink deep of the mystic shining cup\n\nAnd ecstasy through all our being leaps—\n\nDeath bows his head and weeps.\n\n\n-Rainer Maria Rilke\n",
  "page 68": "The wrinkled old man frowns, \"So, you\u0027re throwing your one chance for redemption?\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t need redemption from the likes of you.\" You seethe back, channeling your undead cajones. \"You want me to fight for you, but you\u0027re too worried about the decision that you wouldn\u0027t let any of the other Zealots.\n\n\"I won\u0027t tell you your wrong, but I will tell you that you\u0027re a fool to choose a unredeemed death over a redeemed life. But I cannot pretend to comprehend the demons.\"\n\nYou tilt your head, \"You don\u0027t really believe I\u0027m a demon, do you?\" He continues to frown. \"This... You wouldn\u0027t give me any sort of chance if you actually backed your beliefs. By now you must be just fear-mongering. But why?\"\n\n\"Humanity needs a common-enemy, something to band us together to fight and destroy. That, and only that, will keep us alive.\"\n\nThe priest turns his back to you, and begins to slowly creep away. You struggle, and you yell out to try and kill him, to get out of this room. Yet, the UV-lights seem to hold you down, and when you realize what is happening. Flames emit from the bottom of your chair and begin to lick at your skin...\n\n\nYou have been killed by the hands of the Church.\n",
  "page 67": "\"Very good.\" The old man grins, \"Your training shall commence soon enough. Now, you will be fed every once in a while, we have some animals out back that you can feast from, if you want. But you certainly won\u0027t be getting human blood, haha.\"\n\nRegardless of your reasons for accepting the devil\u0027s bargain, you can\u0027t help but find him horribly irritating currently. You sigh, realizing that the only thing you can look forward to this week is the blandly colored room and the sneering priest. \"Goodbye, then, Vampire of the Light.\"\n\nThe priest happily shuffles away into the clinking gear-based doors, and your mind wanders...\n\nDays pass, and you\u0027d be lying if you said that you weren\u0027t surprised that the withered old geezer wasn\u0027t mentoring you himself. Of course, this makes sense-- the rest of the Church would probably lynch him if he declared you \u0027AOK\u0027, but it\u0027s more surprising how spry the man is. He spends the next few days teaching you boring protocol, not-as-boring use of standardized C.E. weaponry, and a quick, refined crash-course through some-sort of martial art. Surprisingly, he doesn\u0027t bother you with the gospel of the Zealots, but you\u0027re too busy working on yourself in order to reflect on that.\n\nWithin a week, he manages to transform you into what he thinks is a Creation killing machine. And it\u0027s then when he reveals the plan you were already somewhat familiar with. \"It is necessary that we raid the Wolf hideout, and completely eliminate the Wolf threat once and for all, when they least expect it. We have found their coordinates, finally,\" he hands you a tablet, showing a mapping of the surrounding desert, \"And can now make sure they can no longer harm themselves or anyone else anymore. So, Vampire-Of-Light, do you think you\u0027re ready to take on the Demons, as is your holy mission?\"\n\n\"Sir, yes sir!\"\n\nHe grins, then outfits you with standard Zealot equipment; armor, rifle, and various gadgets used for communication.\n\n\"Now just wait here while I get the rest of the Zealots ready. Tonight, you will banish the evil in our own backyards! Godspeed, soldier.\" With that, he leaves, finally leaving you alone.\n\nAh, the open air and the cold night sky. Beautiful in many ways, and-- wait, I\u0027m outside! I can run away from this place! I can\u0027t believe they\u0027re letting me out unsupervised like this...\n",
  "page 69": "Your mentor, the Ghoul, and yourself make your way through the remnants of the past world. Suddenly, it all makes sense to you. The world went to hell, and it was the Professor\u0027s abuse of his Creations that furthered it. Now, the Church hunts you all down for no reason other than to to give hope to \u0027real\u0027 humans. It\u0027s despicable, but it\u0027s the world you\u0027re in right now.\n\nThe hot sun beats down upon you, while your slave suddenly comes to a halt. \"This is it.\" He blandly calls out, reaching down to the sandy flooring, and makes hand motions as to move some of the sand away.\n\nYou turn to wish your master a farewell, but he is already gone. Only a hazy version of him can be seen through squinting in the distance. So, it\u0027s just me and my Ghoul. Let\u0027s just hope it doesn\u0027t get bloody...\n\nYou follow David\u0027s beckoning, and bend down to see what he was unclearing. As your slave digs, more and more sand  seems to pile in. \"What are we looking for?\"\n\n\"They\u0027re underground, sir.\"\n\nWith a nod, you decide to help out with the digging. As you lay your hands on the sand, you thank fortune that you hadn\u0027t done this in the middle of the day, rather than just an hour or so after sun-rise. The sand would no doubt have burnt your fingers otherwise! Even though you and your ghoul are digging barehanded, it doesn\u0027t take too much time before you begin to feel the sand getting thicker, more doughy. With quick powerful stroke, you continue ripping through the sand, throwing it out of your radius, soon creating a little pit, low enough that you could stand up in it. After clawing at the earth with your servant for a while, you accidentally scratch at something... Hard, metallic. Underneath the sand lay a metal disk, with evenly-spaced holes around it\u0027s edge and the middle. Even as it is right now, it\u0027s fairly obvious that the disk is heavily embedded into the ground, and prying it out would no doubt prove to be a challenge. At first, you try just digging around and under it, but your efforts seemed to have been in vain; the plate appeared to be a part of both the earth and some sort of brick-well that goes much further down.\n\n\"You sure this is the place? You ask, making sure that this was the opening to the Wolf Stronghold. It\u0027d make sense, as this is extremely safe from the Zealots, considering.\n\n\"Yes.\" Comes the monotone reply, \"The few remaining GPS satellites pin-pointed this exact spot. We caught several monsters disappearing from under the sand here.\"\n\n\nNow, how should we try to open this?\n",
  "page 60": "His story is... Interesting, to say the least. So Simon Kurschner is the Professor\u0027s actual name.\n\n\"So what do you want from me?\" You ask, uncertain of yourself. Who is my main enemy? The Professor or the Church? Both? Is the Professor even still alive?\n\nThe Father nods, \"We need you to lead us to the other Creations, so we can finish them once and for all. You are the last of the Vampires, and you can most likely help our charge on the Wolves. As I said, the Creations are very powerful. Having one on our side could be a huge help.\"\n\nYou smirk back at him, \"Why though? It\u0027s not like you\u0027ve given me any sort of ambition to help you wackos.\"\n\n\"Well, I thought life was good objective.\" He shrugs, bringing his hand close to the opening of his robes.\n\n\"You think I\u0027d sell out my fellow Creations just for myself?\"\n\n\"I\u0027d be surprised if you cared for them-- you don\u0027t even remember them! You have no connection to this world anymore.\" He grimaces, taking a knobby finger and waving it at your chest. \"The only thing that may be left is your heart, and even that is subject to debate. Will you side with us, the humans, or die here. The choice is yours. Light and Darkness, that is your only option here!\"\n\n\nLight and Darkness, but is it really that simple?\n",
  "page 61": "The wrinkled old man frowns, \"So, you\u0027re throwing your one chance for redemption?\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t need redemption from the likes of you.\" You seethe back, channeling your undead cajones. \"You want me to fight for you, but you\u0027re too worried about the decision that you wouldn\u0027t let any of the other Zealots.\n\n\"I won\u0027t tell you your wrong, but I will tell you that you\u0027re a fool to choose a unredeemed death over a redeemed life.
