  "A great war is about to erupt, the greatest  the world has ever seen since the Trojan war. As the Greek city states are about to be engulfed in civil war, one man has to undertake a great journey. A dangerous road lies ahead, but you must take it, for the odyssey of one will decide the fate of many. This story is loosely based on the famous Greek epic: the Odyssey, by Homer.\nNote that this is more of a story than a game. Depending on your choices, it can be either pretty long, or very short.\n "
