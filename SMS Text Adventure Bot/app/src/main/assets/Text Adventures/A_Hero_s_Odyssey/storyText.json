I see a great palace in the land of the Spartans. I see a king, betrayed by his courtiers and a great fire spreading through Greece.

This is all I can offer you.

You are immediately crushed by the brute force with which the cyclops swing his hand towards you.\n\nAs a sharp pain flows throughout your body, a golden light fills your vision. These are the last experiences in this realm before your soul travels to the realm of Hades.\n",
  "page 82": "The following morning, the cyclops awakes. After he milks his sheep he prepares another meal, with two other companions of yours. After he finishes his dinner he drives his animals outside the cave. Afterwards he picks up the stone and puts it once again in front of the entrance, as easily as one closes a quiver with a cover.\n\nInside the damp, cold cave you you check your surroundings, devising a plan to bring demise to your one-eyed host, to punish him for his cruelty and to bring glory to Athens. Near one of the walls of the vaulted cave lay a pole, freshly cut by the Cyclops, which he uses to prepares fires for cooking when it\u0027s dried. It is about the size of the mast of a small ship. After finishing a sharp point to the pole you stick it in the glowing embers of his fire, to harden it. After the pole is sufficiently hardened you hide it in a pile of droppings in the back of the cave, a pretty big pile.\n\nThat evening your host returns. After he drives his cattle into the cave he once again seals of the entrance of the cave with the huge stone. Then he cooks two more men, now there are only you, Cyrus and one of the crew members remaining.\n",
  "page 81": "While you think about your plan to murder your host a thought comes into your mind. After the giant man entered the cave he blocked the exit with a high, immensly huge stone, not even twenty-two cariages with four wheels could move it from it\u0027s place. If you killed the cyclops now, there is no possible way for you to leave the cave.\n\nSighing, you and your men await the radiant dawn.\n",
  "page 84": "You watch in horror as the frighening giant finishes his macabre meal. After he wipes the last bloodstains from his chin you approach your host with the sack of wine you took as a meeting gift.\n\n\u0027Most noble host. Please accept this peace offering.we brought with us as a meeting gift, it will taste good after your meal of human flesh. We came here, hoping that you were a kind and generous host who could help us to reach the island of Sparta. But why, do you think, shall people visit this island once again, after all the misery that you put us through.?\u0027\n\nAfter you speak this words, the cyclops takes the sack of unmixed win and takes a large swig of it. He obviously likes the wine and answers:\n\n\u0027This wine is amazing. Don\u0027t take me wrong, even in the lands of the cyclopses the gods send the rain from the skies which make the grape vines flourish, but this wine is like ambrozia, the nectar of the gods. Please, tell me who you are, noble guest.\u0027\n\nAfter these words he once again puts the sack to his lips and he empties the sack of wine into his mouth. The wine immediately takes effect. Immediately you answer him with the winged words:\n\n\u0027You ask me who I am? Well, I\u0027ll tell you. My glorious name is Nobody. Nobody is the name that my parents gave me and Nobody is the name that I am known by.\u0027\n\n\u0027Well then nobody. In exchange for your gift of wine, I shall give you a gift of my own. You will be the last one of your company that I\u0027ll eat. Let that be my gift to you. Yes, let that be my gift to you...\u0027\n\nAnd with these last words the cyclops falls asleep. You and your companions rush to the pile of droppings and retrieve the sharpened pole from underneath. You quickly rush to the sleeping giant and stick the pole into his single eyesocket. You keep twisting the pole until the red blood flows from the wound.\n\nAn agonizing roar bellows through the vaulted cave. Frightenend, you and your companions run to the back of the cave. The cyclops stands up from the floor of the cave, still screaming and roaring, calling for the help of the cyclopses that inhabit the surrounding caves...\n",
  "page 83": "As your host is occupied with his meal you quickly pull out the pole from the droppings. Wobbling beneath the weight of the large piece of wood you try to sneak up on the dining giant. However, he notices that something is wrong and he turns around, with a leg from one one your men still in his hands.\n\n\u0027What are you doing? Are you really such cowardly men?\u0027\n\nHe throws the limb of your crew member away and stands up from the cave floor. Frightened, you drop the pole and try to run away, only to be blocked by the giant stone in front of the exit. The cyclops approaches you with thundering footsteps. Fear grips your hearts as the last remaining crew member is smashed to death against the huge stone. You draw your sword in a futile attempt to stop the giant from causing any more harm.\n\nThe cyclops laughs as he crushes Cyrus with a single sweep from his arm. Enraged by this sight you charge the giant with your drawn sword, oblivious to the rest of the world.\n\nThe next thing you feel is a sharp pain shooting through your body as almost every bone is your body is crushed beneath the force of the cyclops\u0027s blow. A golden light fills your vision as your soul enters the realm of Hades.\n",
  "page 86": "With a great effort he manages to reach the entrance of the cave. He uses his tremendous strength to remove the stone blocking the entrance. Almost instantly you hear thundering footsteps closing in on the cave. Booming voices speak outside: \u0027Polyphemos, what happened to you? Why are you disturbing the divine night with your cries for help? Has someone with great strength hurt you, or were you tricked by some malevolent scheme?\u0027\n\nYour host, the brutish Polyphemus, answers his brothers: \u0027My brothers, Nobody is hurting me with his schemes, there is no violence.\u0027\n\nThe others answer with the winged words: \u0027But if nobody is hurting you and you are there all alone, then why are you Disturbing our slumbers? If a disease or other affliction from the gods struck you, it is of no use to shout, for you can\u0027t take actions against the immortal Zeus, the cloud-gatherer. Try praying to our father, Poseidon, the god of the seas.\u0027\n\nAfter they spoke these words his brothers left the grounds of the godlike Polyphemus. Smiling, you see how the cyclops, while feeling his way across the cave, positions himself next to the exit of his cave.\n",

Time flies when you think intensely about things, maybe you should give up your job as a bard and become a philosopher. The assembly of the people is the highest ruling organ in Athens. The people decide on the future of the city, there is no single ruler or single ruling party. Normally only the richer people, that have the right to vote, attend the assembly. Today, however it seems like every person has come to the meeting place on the hill the Pnyx. But then again, today is not an ordinary day.\n\n\n\u0027The time has come to take up our arms. Sparta, our old enemy has declared war upon us and many other Greek city states! Many other cities, like the city of Thebes, have declared war upon each other. An army of enemies will be arriving here within days! Now is the time to take up our arms, assemble the hoplites, mount our horses with their fast feet. Now is the time to defend our homeland against the aggressors, now is the time to fight!\u0027\n\n\nThe speaker now shouts across the gathered crowd. The crowd shouts angrily in response.

You see, hotheaded bard, even the gods have to bow to certain laws, like fate and moral. Even the almighty gods are only allowed to change the fate of mortals by a slight amount, but eventually god and mortal alike have to bow to fate. During the Trojan War many heroes died and many innocents were send to Hades, much earlier than was their fate. In order to prevent such large changes in the fates of men, who inhabit the earth, Zeus has decreed that no god may ever again mingle in the great wars of men. And he made certain that this law could never be changed.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027You have spoken well Athena, my dearest daughter. As you can see bard, the gods can\u0027t change the fates of the people who are about to die in this great war, only you can, as is your destiny.

Dazed, you watch across the city walls, oblivious to the rest of the world. However, you quickly come to your senses as you spot a Spartan soldier that has nearly reached the top of the wall. You pick up the shield and spear that you dropped when you tried to evade the deadly arrows. To your horror you realise that you can\u0027t move your spear arm and you realise that an arrow has lodged itself in your shoulder.\n\n\nThe Spartan soldiers have now reached the top of the walls and are advancing towards you and a few of the other survivors. Since there is no way that you can win this fight with only a shield, you retreat, stumbling over the corpses that now litter the once great walls of Athens. When you finally descend the walls you spot the swift-footed Polymachos, one of the most experienced marshals in Athens, giving orders to his men. \u0027Reinforce the walls, don\u0027t give them the chance to open the gates!\u0027\n\n\nYou wrestle yourself through the soldiers that ascend the walls, trying to repel the invading Spartans, but finally you reach solid ground. You realize that you are more of a burden then an advantage to your fellow soldiers, so you drop your shield and walk away from the gates. Polymachos gives you an angry look but he turns away from you and runs towards the lion-hearted defenders of Athens. You now have a dilemma. Should you help defend the walls, or do you retreat to another part of the city?\n",

The cool evening wind that is always present on the top of the big stone walls of Athens seems to be filled with the smell of burning wood. Great pyres of smoke have been visible for days since the Spartans and their allies invaded the lands of Athens. From your high point of view on top the gatehouse you can see the camp of the gathered enemies. A chill runs down your spine as you think of the fighting that has been occurring the last few days. Although the Athenian forces have been able to repel the invading forces, many people have lost their lives. Frankly, you don\u0027t believe that you are able to win this war. Most of the people that are defending the city only had the two years of mandatory military education. They are just regular citizens that were drafted to defend Athens in this great war.\n\n\nYou can see light dawning on the horizon, a new day has begun. A new day, filled with fighting. You can see activity in the enemy camp, men gathering, men mounting horses, people grabbing weapons and gathering in formation. You remember when these men first showed up on the edge of the horizon. You remember the men, women and children in front of them, running away, fleeing into the city. You remember men screaming as they assaulted the high walls of Athens, screaming when you pushed their ladders down to the hard earth, screaming as their souls passed on to the underworld.\n\n\nYou lift your shield as the enemy army marches towards the city, the fight is about to begin.\n\n\nMoments later you spot the first ladders being put against the walls and you rush towards them, either to push them down or to kill the men that are scaling them. Suddenly you hear a familiar sound, like a thousand birds flapping their wings in the skies. A shadow blocks the light of the sun as thousands of arrows fly towards the city of Athens.\n",

And yes, Zeus, father of men and gods, highest of rulers, I do think that this mortal can complete the task we are about to give him.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Apollo? Zeus? How hard was I hit by that flying piece of vermin?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027He\u0027d better be, the fate of the world rests on his shoulders.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Open your eyes mortal. I know you are awake. I hope my owl didn\u0027t hit you too hard. Don\u0027t be afraid.\u0027\n\n\nYou slowly open your eyes, afraid to be blinded once again by that golden light. But this time nothing happens. When your eyes are fully opened and have adjusted to the darkness of the night, you see three people. Somehow they look familiar, like people you pass everyday without really looking at them. But on the other hand, you think you have seen their faces over a million times. When you realize just who you are looking at, your jaw drops with surprise. You are looking at three of the Olympic gods; the bright-eyed Athena, the ever-young Apollo and the aegis bearing Zeus. \u0027I... I... How... When...\u0027 While you try to make a coherent sentence, Athena speaks to you:\n\n\n\u0027Please remain calm bard, great teller of tales, and listen to what we have to say. The world as you know it is about to undergo a radical change. War is about to erupt between the Greek city states, a war of which the likes haven\u0027t been seen since the great Trojan war. Many heroes died then, and many more will die now. You are the last hope of the Greeks.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027But what can I do to help? I\u0027m just an ordinary bard. If the fate of the Greek cities hangs in the balance, then why can\u0027t the gods solve it? I mean, my people pray to you every day. Is this how you repay us?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Insolent mortal. Is this how you repay us? Is this how you repay the immortal gods, who gave you life, who helped you in your times of need? If my daughter didn\u0027t favor you so much I would smite you on this spot.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027That will be enough father. I understand why you are angry, aoidos, but let us explain first. Even the gods are bound by rules, by fate, by moral. After the Trojan war Zeus decreed that no immortal gods may ever be involved in a war between humans again. The fact that we are giving you this advice is as far as we can go without upsetting the balance in the world. In order to avert this war you have to undertake a journey. You have to travel to the great oracle at Thebes, in the lands of the Aegyptians. There you will have to ask for advice on how to avert this war.\n\n\nStill baffled from your sudden encounter with the gods you answer:\n\n\n \n",

The beauty of the night sky always calms you after your performances. However, as you gaze at the stars you suddenly see a golden light shining between the buildings of the temple complex, the acropolis.\n\n\nCurious, you cross the acropolis to get closer to the huge temple. When you approach it you see that someone placed the statue of the goddess Athena outside. Something is strange, though. The statue, that you know is made from marble, gold and silver, is glowing with a golden glow. The statue of Nike that she normally holds in her hand is gone and replaced by her shield, that normally lies by her side. You get uneasy and turn to walk away.\n\n\n\u0027Halt!\u0027\n\n\nYou turn around. Did someone just say something? You quicken your pace.\n\n\n\u0027Halt!\u0027\n\n\nOkay, you are really starting to freak out now. You now start running away from the Parthenon.\n\n\n\u0027Foolish mortal.\u0027\n\n\nYou spot an owl flying towards you.

But so be it, if you will not fulfill this task, then the Greek cities are doomed.\u0027\n\n\nThe sound of thunder is becoming overwelming. While you cover your ears to block out the sound you see Athena looking at you with a sad expression. When the sound reaches it\u0027s climax a huge lightning bolt hits the acropolis.

  "page 96": "The dark clouds in the night sky block even the stars themselves. Thunder roars as Poseidon unleashes his wrath upon your vessel. Your men\u0027s cries of fear are like a whisper compared to the sound of the waves crashing against your ship. Violent gusts of wind sweep across the deck like raging lions, taking everyone who is in their path.\n\nYou wander across the deck, helpless, trying to think of a way to avert this disaster. Two of the sailors are pulled to their deaths at the bottom of the seas by a large wave, three more are killed by falling debris. The planks of the ship crack and fracture underneath the might of the ocean. The sail is torn apart by the swift winds and a couple of men are caught by it, a moment later it drifts helplessly on the wine-coloured sea.\n\nYou manage to hold on to the broken mast as a large wave clears the deck of rubble and men. You look across the ship and to your horror only a few men are still alive. The moaning of the dying sends chills up your spine.\n\nThe howling winds become more and more violent. With all of your strength you manage to hold on to the broken ship. However, many men can\u0027t. You see many of your companions being blown away into the violent ocean. You cry out to the gods, begging them to stop this slaughter, but to no avail.\n\nYou hear a familiar voice next to you. As you turn you see Cyrus battling the winds and the sea. You try to shout to him, to tell him to have faith and to not give up fighting. But even before your words from in your mouth you see Cyrus being dragged of by the winged winds. The world around slows down as you see the horrified look upon your friend\u0027s face.\n\nSuddenly a sharp pain fills your head as you are hit by a flying piece of wood. You flash in and out of consciousness as the ship finally breaks beneath the thundering waves.\n\nThe cold ocean surrounds you...\n\nYou are flailing helplessly with your arms...\n\nA body drifts by...\n\nYour hand touches a large piece of wood...\n\nWith your last strength you manage to hold on...\n\nThe ship is nowhere to be seen...\n\nYou are alone...\n\n \n",

The gods have decided to help us, so Aeolos locked up the winds in this bag.

Do you think you can fool us with such a lame story? Give us that bag and we will continue your bloody odyssey.

You just have to believe me, bad things will happen if this bag is opened.\u0027\n\n\nThis wasn\u0027t exactly what the crowd wanted to hear. They overrun you and Cyrus and grab the bag from your hands. You are in no position to oppose them when Ericles unties the cords that keep the winds locked inside.\n\n\nA violent whirlwind sweeps across the deck, pouncing on the crew, the ship and you.

  "page 192": "You take a deep breath as you walk along the docks of Sparta. You have finally reached your destination, after many hardships and the death of your friends you\u0027ve finally made it. Your moment of happiness is short-lived though, as you realize your real task has only just begun. Someone somewhere in this great city is going to be responsible for the civil war that will engulf Greece, and it is your task to stop it, Your short moment of happiness is thus replaced by desperation, you have absolutely no idea where to start looking.\n\n\nYou walk across the harbor, watching the ship come and go across the busy river and the people walk by. When you realize you won\u0027t find anything lingering here you walk to the city. You don\u0027t feel at ease in the warrior city. Sparta and Athens are almost complete contrasts of each other. Athens is a centre of art and philosophy and houses some of the most beautiful buildings in Greece, while the whole of Sparta is dedicated to the art of warfare, it\u0027s houses almost completely devoid of any decorations. While Sparta controls a large part of the Peloponnese it\u0027s theatre is smaller than most provincial towns and the city watch is acts ruthlessly against anyone who breaks the law. The Spartans themselves don\u0027t even work their own lands, the peoples they conquered have to work for them as semi-slaves.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so of exploring the city you decide to call it a day and enter a tavern. The dimly lit place if filled with people from all over Greece, traders from Syracuse, a couple of actors from Athens, you think you\u0027ve seen them perform back in Athens once, in the back are some Spartan soldiers and half-hidden behind them are seafarers from Crete, pirates by the looks of them. As you order your drink you can\u0027t but help overhear a conversation:\n\n\n\u0027Well, it has been a couple of years since the king died, it\u0027s about time she remarried, I mean, she isn\u0027t even past childbearing age.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027That\u0027s true, but Nelei musn\u0027t marry any one of her suitors. She needs a strong husband, one who can resist Akakios. Although Nelei is queen, she is still a woman and as such has nothing to say in politics, and her son has not yet come of age.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027What\u0027s wrong with Akakios, he\u0027s only a council member isn\u0027t he?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Yes, but one who is bribing about half of the council of elders, and the other half consists of senile old fools.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027And yet most of those councilors are Nelei\u0027s suitors.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Which is exactly my point. Everyone knows Akakios wants to steer towards war with the other city states.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027And why is that such a problem, everyone knows Sparta is the mightiest city state in the whole of Greece?\u0027\n\n\nYour heart is pounding, this is the reason of the civil war, one of the councilors will marry the queen and as a result Sparta will go to war. You throw some coins at the innkeeper and rush out of the tavern, leaving baffled customers and a baffled innkeep behind.\n",
  "page 191": "You wake up, and quickly fall back asleep, a couple of times more. However, you never manage to get to know more about your surroundings apart from small, incoherent impressions.\n\n\nBut eventually you manage to gather enough strength to stay conscious for a longer period of time.\n\n\nAs you open your eyes with much effort you are amazed with what you see. You are aboard a ship, about medium-sized by the looks of it. You are lying in a ornately decorated bed which in itself must cost more than what you earn as a bard in an entire year. An array of bronze objects are visible on a nearby wooden desk: astrolabes, scales, even a small scale model of the solar system. Whoever owns this ship is either a trader or a scholar.\n\n\nYou hear stumbling in the room next to yours. The door separating them opens to reveal an elderly man, with grey hair wearing clean, white robes. When he speaks he sounds distracted, as if the affairs of the mortal world are not important enough to catch his attention. \u0027Welcome, stranger. I can see the questions in your face and I will answer them. My name is Angellios, and I am a priest of the bright Apollo.You might want to know why you are on my ship. Well, the short answer is: because I found you. The long answer is: the gods have sent me a vision, they told me to rescue you from the cold embrace of Poseidon and bring you to Sparta. To be honest, you are one of the few people I let aboard my ship. I use this vessel to completely separate myself from the civilized world, so I can completely focus on my study and the worship of the great Apollo. But since you have regained your strength it is almost time for us to say goodbye. We arrived at the docks of Sparta three days ago and too be honest, those have been three days too much.\u0027\n\n\nAlthough he obviously tries to hide his annoyance of human contact, you reply that you realize that you have been a burden for Angellios and that you thank him for all his good care. You decline his offer of a strange meal consistent of an array of strange mushrooms and disembark after another thorough thank-you.\n",

A thick mist obscures your view and you can see the anxiety on the face of the ship\u0027s navigator.\n\n\n\u0027I\u0027m sorry sir, but a thick mist has set in during the night. I cannot guarantee that we are still on the right course. And given the urgency of your \u0027quest\u0027 I am sure you would not have liked it if we suspended our voyage.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027But I\u0027d rather had...\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Yes, I\u0027m sure you had wished the mist wouldn\u0027t have set in, but we can\u0027t change the past, can we?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027No, but that\u0027s not what...\u0027\n\n\n\u0027I thought so, so we\u0027ll just sea where the currents take us. Hahaha, sea, get it?\u0027\n\n\nAnd with those wise words he walks away, laughing maniacally to himself.\n\n\nCyrus approaches you with a smirk on his face. \u0027So you\u0027ve had a nice chat with our navigator huh. Well, he is a kind of a nutjob, but you won\u0027t find a better one in the whole of Greece.\u0027 He leaves again, chuckling.\n\n\nAs hours pass, the fog thickens even more and eventually it is impossible to see more than 4 feet ahead of you. Even worse, the ship is mysteriously losing speed. The navigator is walking around like a confused chicken, walking in circles while making strange noises to himself.\n\n\nSuddenly you hear surprised chatter among the crew. Several crew members are pointing at something in the fog. You gaze at the fog but you can\u0027t see a thing. But then, just as you are about to turn away you see it: blinking lights pierce through the fog. As if an invisible hand wipes away the fog, it opens up, revealing a green island. What immediately draws your attention is a large house on a hill, gleaming as if made of solid gold.\n\n\nAfter a quick meeting with the crew you decide that, since your ship now has lost all speed, you will all go ashore in dinghies. Of course your curiosity also played a part in this decision.\n\n\n \n\n \n",
  "page 193": "Apart from some near-collisions with crocodiles and other inhabitants of the vibrant Nile, your trip back across is rather uneventful. Fair winds are guiding you towards Sparta and the radiant sun is spreading it\u0027s warm veil across the deck of your hired vessel. With such fair winds blowing in your sail, the oars have been stowed away and the crew is relaxing on deck. you find yourself gazing at the horizon, wishing that all days could be like this one. But then you remember your daunting task, and dark storm clouds gather in your mind.\n\n\nCyrus notices your worried face and approaches you. \u0027My dear friend, what could possibly be bothering you on such a beautiful day? Like my  dear mother always used to say: \u0027Life\u0027s to short to waste a sunny day. Save your worries for when it rains.\u0027 She also had some other sayings, but those are not really appropriate in, well actually all sorts of company.\u0027\n\n\nYour mood instantly brightens, you even manage to produce a smile. Following Cyrus\u0027 advice you just fit back and enjoy the voyage.\n\n\n...\n\n\nAs the starry night drives away the shining day, you and the crew go to sleep. Only a few crew members stay on deck to act as sentries. the worries that clouded your mind have not returned. You twist and turn in your sleep as a sense of foreboding doom fills your dreams. You see flashes of images: a beautiful mansion on top of white cliffs, dozens of swines approach you, a bedchamber with a magnificently decorated bed. Then a golden figure approaches and pushes away all other images: Athena, the owl-eyed protector of heroes. \u0027Brave traveller, noble bard, you\u0027re journey has only just begun. Sparta is still far away, but tomorrow you will reach an island, the island of the goddess Circe, the daughter of Helios, the sun-god. You will have to be on your guard, for she is a powerful witch, expect the unexpected and don\u0027t lose your objective out of sight: saving Greece from the flames of war. I wish you good luck.\u0027\n\n\nWith these words she leaves your dreams.\n",
  "page 196": "The dining hall is breathtakingly beautiful. The tables are placed in a circle in the middle of the room, in the middle of the circle roars a great fire that fills the hall with a warm glow. The food is exquisite, food and delicacies from all over the world are represented: dates from the east, flamingo from Aegyptos, olives from Syracuse and more seafood than you can name, all served in Carthaginian glassware and Roman pottery More fresco\u0027s of pastoral scenes decorated the otherwise bare walls. The marble columns that support the roof are chiseled in a way that makes them look like they are revolving around their own axis, grape branches have winded themselves around their tops. A giant loom is tucked away in a corner.\n\n\nCirce speaks amiably to your crew men, speaking to each of them with civility, listening attentively to their every word en laugh at every joke. It seems your men have a great time. Yet you are not as talkative as you usually are, and the delicious food just barely registers in your mouth. Seeing such kindness and joy you realize just how far you are away from your family and friends in Athens. With a sigh you remember every single face and every single smile. And now you are here, who knows how far away from your home, traveling on some journey given to you by either the gods of figments of your delusional mind, as for that you still aren\u0027t certain. Even more depressing is the fact that there is a very real possibility that you will never see your beloved ones again.\n\n\nYou hardly notice the soft hand Circe puts on your shoulder. \u0027My dear guest, I can see that something is bothering you. Is there any way I can help you?\u0027\n\n\nYou try to turn your face away from hers. \u0027My graceful hostess, I am sorry. Here, in your warm house I realize how much I miss my beloved ones. Far away I have traveled from them and I scarcely said goodbye to them. And now, I don\u0027t know, I am just a little bit depressed.\u0027\n\n\nShe answers you with a kind smile, looking absent, as if gazing at something far away in the distance: \u0027My dear guest I know how you feel. My family is far away from here as well and the man who I loved most in the whole world has left me long ago. You kind of remind me of him. He too was a traveler, far away from his home after he got lost at sea. The god Poseidon cursed him and he and his men arrived at my island. They stayed for a year, but then they left again, taking my heart with them.\u0027 she shakes her head as if to bring herself back into the present, \u0027but now is not the time for sad reminiscence, let us drink and be merry and forget our troubles for a while. Here, let me refill your cup with this exquisite wine, it\u0027s almost magical.\u0027\n\n\nShe pours a deep red wine into your cup. Trying to forget your sad thoughts you taste it. It is the sweetest, most delicious drink you have ever tasted. Like the honey that is made painstakingly by the smallest bees and is the sweetest thing known in the Greek world, and when one eats it one cannot but forget his troubles for a brief while. Even that cannot match the wine you are tasting right now. You quickly drain the cup.\n\n\nThe wine leaves the faint taste of herbs in your mouth and a drowsy feeling in your head. Your eyelids are becoming increasingly heavy and you feel your head drop. As you look across the table you can see the same thing happening to your men. As you look to her to ask for an explanation you see her grabbing a wand from a dresser. She can see your question in your eyes and she answers you with her sweet voice: \u0027But you won\u0027t leave me. You will stay here, with me, until the end of times, just like all other travelers that have come here since my love left me. But to make sure you won\u0027t escape I have to may a few arrangements.\u0027\n\n\nShe gracefully walks towards you. You try to back away, but your limbs won\u0027t listen to the signals from your brains. She lifts her wand menacingly and you close your eyes. The pain you are expecting stays away and you only feel the gentle tap of Circe\u0027s wand upon your head. As you open your eyes with relieve you notice that something is wrong. You see your hands turn into hoofs before your eyes and a snout sprouts where your nose used to be. You fall of your chair, on all four of your legs. You are only able to make grunting sounds as you try to shout to your men.\n\n\nThe last thing you are able to register with your human mind are the kind words of Circe: \u0027Come, come little piglet. We\u0027ll have a great time together, until time itself seizes to exist.\u0027\n",
  "page 195": "You feel the familiar feeling of sands shifting beneath your feet as you step out of the dinghy. Beautiful palm trees dot the beach, providing shade from the blissful heat of the sun. Playful fish approach you and scurry away, following the coming and going of the sea. The deep blue waves of the sea shape the sand in an elaborate pattern, both beautiful and enigmatic at the same time, much like the rest of the island. You can see a large mansion on top of a low hill about 300 feet inland, surrounded by large gardens. Some distance from the mansion you see some piggeries.As you and your companions walk along the beach you can\u0027t help but wonder who lives in such a beautiful place, surely such a place would be fit for one of the inhabitants of the wide skies.\n\n\n The soft sands give way to marble steps, which form a path that leads to the luxurious mansion. Without a single doubt in your mind you climb the steps, determined to meet the inhabitant of such a wondrous place. As you near the mansion you notice that fatigue does not even begun to grip your limbs, nor those of your companions, on the contrary, you feel a blissful sense of joy overcome you as you near the mysterious dwelling. You look at the mansion in more detail. The walls are made of gleaming white marble, decorated with gold and silver fresco\u0027s depicting a rural scene: a shepherdess herding groups of animals, like pigs but lions and wolves too. The grand oaken doors are decorated with gold leaf and the silver knockers are shaped like hourglasses.\n\n\nYou are about to grab one of the knockers when the door opens on it\u0027s own accord, revealing a beautiful woman. Her beautiful white robe is fastened around her waist with a golden girdle. She wears her golden hair in a long plaited braid and on top of her head she wears a golden circlet. Her face is unfathomable, but her skin is white as milk. She speaks to you and your companions in a voice as sweet as honey: \u0027Excuse me, noble visitors, but I was not expecting you. May I ask you who you are and why you have come here?\u0027\n\n\nYou answer her: \u0027noble lady, me and my companions have been traveling far and wide. But the gods have not favored us. The winds, which are sometimes the sailors best friends, but sometimes their enemies, have been absent for a long time and we have not been able to reach our destination. Our supplies have run out and then, like a sign of the gods, we saw your island on the horizon.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027I see... Of course I will give you enough supplies to continue your journey, the gods have not given me riches only to keep them to myself, have they? But to be honest: you look like you\u0027re starving. Please, come inside and join me for diner. I was just about to...\u0027\n\n\nSuddenly a pig bumps into her. It then turns to you, shaking it\u0027s head violently. Astonished by this sight you fail to produce any comprehensible words. The mysterious woman, straitening her dress, speaks to you again:\u0027 Please forgive me, but one of my pigs must have escaped it\u0027s pen. Would you like him for dinner tonight? As I was saying, I would love to share my food with you, please do join me at my table. Oh, did I almost forget to introduce myself: my name is Circe.\u0027\n\n\n \n\n \n",

You tell Circe you\u0027re going back to the ship to rest a little. When she asks you with a sad face if you could at least tell your other men about the dinner you promise her you will. As you walk back across the marble steps you spot docile lions and pigs in their respective pens. Something about the way they look at you doesn\u0027t feel right either. Their looks are not those of wild animals, on the contrary they almost look... human.\n\n\nYou neither saw nor heard him approach you but you suddenly feel a hand tapping you gently on your shoulder. As you turn you see the youthful face of Hermes, the keen-eyed messenger of the gods. \u0027Strange, aren\u0027t they, they have the appearance of animals yet they also seem human. Yet neither the one, nor the other. I can see you have questions and the gods have sent me to answer them.\u0027\n\n\nYou don\u0027t know where to start and you ask him quickly, as if he\u0027ll withdraw his statement if you don\u0027t ask something quickly enough: \u0027Why are we here?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027The gods are testing you.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Athena gave me a warning about a woman named Circe, was that her?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Yes, Circe is a witch, she bewitches men with herbs and magic spells. Hear my words and heed them well: these animals you see before you weren\u0027t always animals. They were men who were stranded on Circe\u0027s island, castaways, merchants, anyone unlucky enough to set foot here is turned into an animal.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027What about my men?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027They too, will be enchanted, cursed to walk the earth as an animal until time itself seizes to exist.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Isn\u0027t there anything I can do to stop her?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027There is a way. Circe bewitches men with the help of magical herbs. However, there is a way to make you immune to her vile witchcraft. Close your eyes.\u0027\n\n\nAs soon as you close your eyes you feel the gentle touch of Hermes\u0027 staff on your forehead. Images of a strange plant float into your mind. It\u0027s flowers are white, yet it\u0027s roots are black and it\u0027s leaves are green, with small white stripes running across the length. You want to open your eyes to ask Hermes what kind of herb he is showing you but you cannot manage to open them.\n\n\nYou hear Hermes\u0027 soft voice, yet you could swear your ears don\u0027t register a thing: \u0027the herb you see is known by the gods as \u0027Moly\u0027, a powerful herb that counteracts any harmful effects done to the one who eats it. However, anyone who tries to pick them without the permission of the immortal gods will die on the very spot. Use it to stop Circe and rescue your friends, but remember: don\u0027t lose sight of your objective.\u0027\n\n\nSilence falls after he spoke these words and after a minute or so you find you can once again open your eyes. The marble step upon which Hermes was standing a moment ago is now empty, bearing no trace or evidence that it was just treaded upon by a deity.\n\n\nRemembering Hermes\u0027 words you spend the next hour searching the island for this so called Moly.\n",

  "page 177": "You have finally reached the magnificent royal palace of the Phaeacians. You instantly know why every single inhabitant of this city knows it. It is by far one of the largest buildings you have ever seen in you life, either in Athens or in any other Greek city. The outside is decorated with beautiful marble sculptures and richly decorated mosaics are laid on the ground. Small trees and different varieties of flowers separate the palace from the street. \n\n\nYou spot two guards in ornate armour standing next to the great wooden gates of the palace. Servants and citizens alike are passing through the entrance to the palace. You hide your sharp bronze sword beneath your clothes the best as you can, since you don\u0027t think the guards will let you enter the palace with a weapon. \n\n\nYou do your best mingling in with the citizens that enter the palace. Your breathing almost stops as you walk past the guards. You imagine them stopping you any moment now, slowly drawing their weapons as they close in on the citizen they do not recognise. You almost can feel the hand of the imaginary guard on your shoulder.\n\n\nYou slowly dare to exhale as you finally reach the courtyard of the palace. People of all ranks and positions mingle in here, as if there is no class difference at all, this is truly an unique sight! You make your way around the different groups, trying to find the throne room. You pass a group of statues depicting the brief history of the Phaeacians. They really are a remarkable people, the previous king, Nausitoös, led the Phaeacians to this island, founding everything you have seen today and more. You recognise one of the last statues as Nausicaä, the princess you met on the beach.\n\n\nNext to these statues is the entrance to the throne room. The high ceiling is supported by several high pillars. Lavish fresco\u0027s decorate the walls. Nobles and courtiers are gathered around a roaring fire in the middle of the room. You spot Nausicaä sitting next to her father in the middle of the room. As she sees you she speaks to her father on his well-built throne: \u0027My noble father, look over there, beneath the well-made archway. This man is my guest. He is a traveller from Athens, many miles from here. The high waves and violent winds smashed his ship and brought him to our shores.\u0027 \n\n\nHer father, the noble Alcinoös answer her: \u0027My dear daughter, any guest of yours is a guest of mine.\u0027 He turns to you, \u0027please, foreign traveller, come closer. You are our honoured guest today. My servants will make sure you will have a comfortable stay here. Please, join us at the dinner table when you are ready.\u0027 \n",
  "page 179": "You reach a street with only two options to choose from:\n",
  "page 181": "You are sitting in the large dining hall next to king Alcinoös. The heavy wood table is covered with the most delicious foods and in the center lies a large, fat swine, fresh from the spit. After a servant fills your plate, a bard enters the hall. The king himself announces him. \u0027My dear friends and family, I am pleased that our dear bard Demodokos is present here this evening. After all, should we not hold all bards in high esteem. For they received their trade from the gods themselves, either from the god Apollo or the muses themselves.\u0027 You smile a little after hearing these words.\n\n\nThe shining bard tells with great skill about the fall of Troy and the sufferings of the godlike Odysseus. After about three hours he conludes his story: \u0027That was the tale of the shrewd Odysseus. Who traveled far and wide after he destroyed the sacred citadel of Troy. But although he suffered much misery in his heart, at sea, he completed his destiny and returned to his home and his faithful wife.\u0027\n\n\nHearing the story about Odysseus, you can\u0027t but compare yourself to him. For you too suffer much, far from your home. You feel tears well up behind your eyes. The noble king notices your obvious sadness and speaks with kind words: \u0027Great Demodokos, with your silver voice, you told a great story, but I think it was a little too much for our honoured guest. This is a feast in his honour, we should laugh, not cry. But tell us, noble traveller, who you are and where you come from.\u0027\n\n\nThe gathered people listen fascinated to every single of your words as you tell about you journey thus far. You tell them everything: your encounter with the gods, the harpies in Egypt, the Oracle, the Scyla and Charibdis, the mutiny on your ship and eventually your adventures in the city.\n\n\nAlcinoös is visibly touched by your story and with his awe-filled voice he speaks to you: \u0027Great bard from Athens, valiant traveller, I, and the rest of my court, have listened to your story with great astonishment. I think I speak for all of the Phaeacians when I say that we will gladly bring you to Sparta with one of our swift ships.\u0027\n\n\nYou answer him with great gratitude: \u0027Noble king, I thank you for this offer and I gladly accept it. You must have exquisite sailors, if they are able to navigate from here to Sparta.\u0027\n\n\nThe king of the Phaeacians answers: \u0027I thank you for the compliment, traveller, but it is not completely true. You see, our ships are special. Tell them where you want to go and they will bring you there, without the need for guidance. Our swift ships will bring you in three days to Sparta.\u0027\n",

  "page 183": "The ship rattles and shakes as violent winds torture the sails and restless waves batter the hull. The obvious signs of looming disaster have not gone unnoticed by your crew. Even the most sturdiest sailors in your crew are praying softly to the immortal gods. \n\n\nDistant lightning illuminates the dark sky. \n\n\nCyrus approaches you, his hairs are wet and windswept by the violent weather. A look of horror is on his face. \u0027My friend, what will this day bring us? What are the almighty gods planning for us today? The crew is restless, everyone can sense that something bad is going to happen.\u0027\n\n\nYou answer him with a slightly trembling voice: \u0027We are on a perilous journey and dangers await us every day. Keep your faith in the all-seeing gods, for they too want us to succeed.\u0027\n\n\nCyrus answer you with a slightly calmer voice: \u0027But sir, how can you know for sure that the gods...\u0027\n\n\nYou interrupt his sentence as you see two shapeless forms materialising at the horizon. You quickly tell Cyrus to send the men back to their stations and prepare for anything. \n\n\nThe two monsters are coming into clear view. You can see a large cave on the left of the narrow strait, a large whirlpool is forming at it\u0027s entrance. On the right you can see a beast with six dog-like head, connected to it\u0027s large body with long necks. \n\n\nYou can practically feel the fear of your crew hanging in the air. The moral drops and cries of fear and despair fill the air.\n\n\n\u0027Zeus, protector of travellers, please keep us safe and...\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Ares, lord of war, shield us mercenaries from danger...\u0027\n\n\nYou make your way to the centre of the ship. Trying the best you can to make your voice audible above the violence of nature you shout: \u0027Brave men, tamers of the wild seas, many dangers have we braved together, why should we die now, on this day? Don\u0027t let fear conquer your heart. Let us sail forwards with determined souls.\u0027\n\n\nThe looks of utter fear are beginning to vanish from the faces of your men.\n\n\n\u0027Now, with a brave heart, let us sail past the...\n",
  "page 182": "You take a deep breath as you walk along the docks of Sparta. You have finally reached your destination, after many hardships and the death of your friends you\u0027ve finally made it. Your moment of happiness is short-lived though, as you realize your real task has only just begun. Someone somewhere in this great city is going to be responsible for the civil war that will engulf Greece, and it is your task to stop it, Your short moment of happiness is thus replaced by desperation, you have absolutely no idea where to start looking.\n\n\nYou walk across the harbor, watching the ship come and go across the busy river and the people walk by. When you realize you won\u0027t find anything lingering here you walk to the city. You don\u0027t feel at ease in the warrior city. Sparta and Athens are almost complete contrasts of each other. Athens is a centre of art and philosophy and houses some of the most beautiful buildings in Greece, while the whole of Sparta is dedicated to the art of warfare, it\u0027s houses almost completely devoid of any decorations. While Sparta controls a large part of the Peloponnese it\u0027s theatre is smaller than most provincial towns and the city watch is acts ruthlessly against anyone who breaks the law. The Spartans themselves don\u0027t even work their own lands, the peoples they conquered have to work for them as semi-slaves.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so of exploring the city you decide to call it a day and enter a tavern. The dimly lit place if filled with people from all over Greece, traders from Syracuse, a couple of actors from Athens, you think you\u0027ve seen them perform back in Athens once, in the back are some Spartan soldiers and half-hidden behind them are seafarers from Crete, pirates by the looks of them. As you order your drink you can\u0027t but help overhear a conversation:\n\n\n\u0027Well, it has been a couple of years since the king died, it\u0027s about time she remarried, I mean, she isn\u0027t even past childbearing age.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027That\u0027s true, but Nelei musn\u0027t marry any one of her suitors. She needs a strong husband, one who can resist Akakios. Although Nelei is queen, she is still a woman and as such has nothing to say in politics, and her son has not yet come of age.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027What\u0027s wrong with Akakios, he\u0027s only a council member isn\u0027t he?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Yes, but one who is bribing about half of the council of elders, and the other half consists of senile old fools.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027And yet most of those councilors are Nelei\u0027s suitors.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Which is exactly my point. Everyone knows Akakios wants to steer towards war with the other city states.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027And why is that such a problem, everyone knows Sparta is the mightiest city state in the whole of Greece?\u0027\n\n\nYour heart is pounding, this is the reason of the civil war, one of the councilors will marry the queen and as a result Sparta will go to war. You throw some coins at the innkeeper and rush out of the tavern, leaving baffled customers and a baffled innkeep behind.\n",
  "page 185": "An eary silence accompanies your ship as you sail forwards towards the dreadful Scylla. Two beams of light pierce the dark skies above, illuminating both your ship and the monster you are about to face. During this moment of peace you gaze at the narrow strait in front of you. On your left you can see the cave of the monstrous Charybdis. A faint shrieking can be heard coming from the entrance, as if it\u0027s inhabitant is weeping at the sight of it\u0027s lost prey. On the right you can see Scylla. It\u0027s six dog-like heads are looking directly at you, full of anticipation and hunger. It\u0027s huge body sits quietly at the shore, awaiting your ship with a rumbling stomach.\n\n\nYour moment of contemplation is swiftly cut short as the heavens above roar once more, an ominous sign for the coming encounter. The current which steers your ship towards the narrow strait is accelerating, as if the seas themselves can\u0027t stand the tension any longer and want to push you faster towards your destiny.\n\n\nThe crew members seem to hold their breath collectively as the ship is almost within reach of the Scylla. The white faces of your crew look like death has already struck your ship.\n\n\nAnd then it strikes...\n\n\nThe six heads of the Scylla pounce on the deck with a ferocious fury. White foam drips from the muzzles of it\u0027s doglike heads. It\u0027s fierce growling muffles the cries of fear and despair from your crew members. Although he even does an even better job at this when each of it\u0027s heads grabs a sailor and swallows it whole.\n\n\nAfter it\u0027s meal it returns to it\u0027s place at the edge of the sea-strait, looking rather content.\n\n\nYour ship quickly sails onwards, with it\u0027s crew mourning their deceased comrades.\n\n\n \n",
  "page 184": "The skies howl and the seas roar as your ship sails towards the monstrous Charybdis. You feel the vessel shaking beneath your feet, as if it too is afraid of the coming confrontation. The islands that seemed so far away are now in front of you. To the far right of the narrow sea-strait you can see the dreadful Scylla. It\u0027s six heads almost look sad at the sight of it\u0027s lost prey. \n\n\nIn front of you you can see the cave of the Charybdis. It\u0027s pitch black entrance stands looming at the side of the sea. You see fear once again gripping the hearts of your crew, even Cyrus looks troubled. And to be honest, you yourself do not feel all too well either.\n\n\nSuddenly a high-pitched shriek sounds from the cave, piercing the hearts and minds of everyone on board, breaking your last mental defences.\n\n\nYou can feel your heart beating in your chest as the shrieking continues. You start to shake as the shriek reaches a climax and then...\n\n\nEverything is silent in what feels like an eternity. Neither the skies nor the seas make a sound and the shrieking from cave has silenced. You feel as if you and the ship are floating in mid-air. You see the crew moving around you in slow-motion, as if the Chronos, the god of time, himself has pulled your ship out of the normal stream of time.\n\n\nThen, as if nature itself is seeking to compensate the slowed down time, the world seems moving at double time. The sounds of the world around you return even louder. The waves are becoming more and more violent. And then the world seems to spin around it\u0027s own axis. You manage to take a quick look at the seas beneath the ship before you, like the rest of the ship, fall down on the deck. But the problem is, the sea has gone. Where once waves were crashing onto the hull of the ship, there is now a black nothingness, a looming darkness that bodes your imminent doom.\n\n\nCharybdis\u0027 shrieking seems much more triumphant now and you realise why. The ship is caught in a large whirlpool. A feeling of falling down accompanies your epiphany. The strange thing is, after all you\u0027ve been through, you are not afraid of dying. You spend your last moments in the world of the living thinking of the people you\u0027ve met, especially of your new friend Cyrus, the places you\u0027ve seen and the choices you\u0027ve made. But you think with regret of the people who will die because of you during Greece\u0027s civil war, which you couldn\u0027t prevent.\n\n\nYou enter Hades with a calm heart, accompanied by a golden light.\n",
  "page 187": "It has been two days since you\u0027re encounter with the dreadful Scylla. The morale of the crew is at an all time low and occasionally you can hear people grumble about how \u0027since they agreed to accompany that crazy bard, all sorts of crazy beasts and monsters have attacked us\u0027.\n\n\nThe shining Eos has sunk beneath the horizon hours ago, yet still you can\u0027t drift off to sleep. You keep thinking about the rebellious morale of the crew and the heavy weight of your objective pressing on your shoulders. The soft, ritmical breathing of the people around you remind you of the fact that you also carry a responsibility for the lives of the crew. You sigh softly, despaired by the seemingly impossible task the immortal gods appointed you.\n\n\nYou watch at the star lighted waves, listening to the soft blowing of the wind. Then the wind starts picking up speed, forming white foam on the tips of the waves.\n\n\nSuddenly you hear one of the boards of the deck creak softly right next to you. An old man carrying a large bag approaches you.\n\n\n\u0027Brave adventurer, I greet you. My name is Aeolos, lord of the winds. The gods are watching your journey from atop of Olympus. I have been sent by the gods to inform you that time has almost ran out for Greece. That is why I have come to give you this.\u0027\n\n\nHe gives you the bag.\n\n\n\u0027To aid you in your journey I have locked up all of the winds in this bag. All but the western wind that will carry your ship to Sparta. But remember: do not, whatever happens, open the bag. I wish you good luck, noble bard.\u0027\n\n\nAnd with these words he disappears in a whirlwind, leaving you bewildered behind. You think you see one of the crew members, Ericles, shifting in his sleep. Yawning, you remember that the night is almost over and Nox, the goddess of the night, will be relieved by Eos in a couple of hours.\n",
  "page 199": "The scene you witness as you enter Circe\u0027s dining hall is... weird to say the least. The hall is magnificently decorated: the walls are covered with fresco\u0027s depicting pastoral scene, much like the ones that decorate the outside walls. The marble columns that support the roof are chiseled in a way that makes them look like they are revolving around their own axis, grape branches have winded themselves around their tops. A giant loom is tucked away in a corner. The dining tables are placed in a circle in the middle of the room, filled with delicacies from all over the known world: dates from the east, flamingo from Aegyptos, olives from Syracuse and more seafood than you can name, all served in Carthaginian glassware and Roman pottery. In the middle of the circle burns a great fire that fills the room with a warm glow.\n\n\nThe strange thing, however, is that Circe is sitting all alone at one of the dinner tables, surrounded by a herd of pigs. Half emptied plates and spilled cups of wine diminish the otherwise superb setting.  You approach her as if you are unaware of her malignant intentions. \u0027My graceful hostess, I hope I am not too late to attend to your dinner. I am feeling better after a quick rest and I would hate to leave without seeing you again. The rest of my men are tending to chores on board of my ship but they will join us in a while.\u0027\n\n\nShe looks at you suspiciously, trying to gauge your intention, but you manage to fool her. \u0027Very well my noble guest, please join me at my table. Your companions are resting upstairs, I\u0027m afraid that they have eaten a little but too much. but who can blame them, the food is delicious. Please, try some, I\u0027ll fill a plate for you if it pleases you. But first, let us drink to your health.\u0027\n\n\nShe gives you a cup of wine. You accept it gracefully, acting as if you didn\u0027t catch her sly smile. As you raise your glass you proclaim: \u0027And to your health as well, fair hostess, that we may drink to your good intentions.\u0027\n\n\nAfter these words you drain your cup. The wine is the sweetest, most delicious drink you have ever tasted. The honey that is made painstakingly by the smallest bees and is the sweetest thing known in the Greek world, and when one eats it one cannot but forget his troubles for a brief while. Even that cannot match the wine you are tasting right now. However, the sweetness of the wine cannot completely hide the taste of unknown herbs.\n\n\nCirce speaks to you with a sweet voice: \u0027Do you like the wine, my noble guest? Isn\u0027t it the sweetest thing you have ever tasted? I keep it specifically for my most valued guests. Too bad though that it bewitches the senses, making one unable to fight off the winged sleep. Unable to defend oneself.\u0027\n\n\nShe rises from her seat and walks towards you, holding a wooden wand in her hand. She taps your head gently with her wand and backs away, awaiting the effects of her magic powers. When nothing happens she raises her hands to the heavens and speaks to you in an astonished voice: \u0027How is this possible? Why are you still a human?\u0027 she suddenly stops speaking, you can see comprehension in her eyes,\u0027of course I should have known, it\u0027s HIM all over again.\u0027\n\n\nWhen you try to ask her who she means she interrupts you, paying no attention to your presence whatsoever she continues her furious contemplation: \u0027A whole year he and his men stayed at my house. A whole year he passed with me, but he had to leave because he missed his home and his wife! His MORTAL wife! I would have given him anything, I would have even made him immortal! But he left me, taking my heart with him.\u0027\n\n\nWhen you once more try to ask who she is talking about she sneers at you: \u0027Like you don\u0027t know him: that Ithacan, who stranded here when he sailed from Troy. The one cursed by the earthshaking Poseidon.\u0027 She bursts into tears. \u0027But you remind me of him, yes, you even look a but like him.\u0027\n\n\nShe walks towards you, having a strange look in your eyes. You quickly stand up from your seat and walk away from her, keeping her inside your vision at all times. Circe extends her arms towards you. \u0027Please noble hero, please let me embrace you. I have just felt so lonely, all alone here on my island, with only these pigs to keep me company. Could you at least do me this honour? I promise I\u0027ll turn your men back to their human forms.\u0027\n",
  "page 18": "You quickly come to your senses and jump aside, dodging the fatal blow. Unfortunately you drop your shield. As you fall to the ground you hit something hard with your elbow. As a sharp pain shoots through your arm you see the enemy preparing for another deadly blow. Fear grips your heart once again as you feel the cold touch of Hades on your shoulder. From utter despair you grope around on the floor, hoping to find anything that you can throw at the enemy general.\n\n\nYour hands find the object with which your elbow came into contact with. You throw it at Dusmenecles with all the strength you have left, closing your eyes, expecting the final blow to come any moment now. You feel like you have been sitting like this for minutes, though it must have been more like seconds, when you hear victorious shouting coming across the battlefield.\n\n\nYou open your eyes, surprised by this sound. And when you look around you see Athenian soldiers shouting and cheering. While you wonder what has caused this sudden turn of events you see the swift-footed Polymachos coming to wards you. \u0027You have my sincerest gratitude, soldier. Because you killed the treacherous enemy general his troops routed and victory was ours. Thank the gods!\u0027\n\n\nYou killed who? Baffled you look at the spot where a few moments ago stood the manslaughtering Dusmenecles. Now you see his body lying on the ground, bleeding from a wound to the head, apparently caused by the broken sword that is sticking out of it. Did I really throw that?\n\n\n\u0027I... I... I...\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Calm down great-hearted soldiers, you fought very bravely today. I am sure that the whole of Athens will commemorate your giant victory.\u0027\n\n\nAll attention is just to much for you, although you are used to giant crowds of people, being a bard and all. You walk across the battlefield to a low hill, still baffled by the events of the day.\n",
  "page 11": "\u0027I\u0027ll just be a burden for the other soldiers\u0027, you think as you run away from the walls.\n\n\nWhile you run through the besieged city you meet other people fleeing from the doomed city. A sense of shock creeps up on you as you realize just how many families are forced from their homes.\n\n\nYou finally manage to reach the opposite gate of Athens. Luckily, this one is badly guarded by the enemies as most of the soldiers are fighting on the other side of the city. A large group of people has already gathered near the gate and you hear shouts coming from it. \u0027Open the gate!\u0027 \u0027No, stay and defend our city!\u0027 \u0027Now, open...\u0027. \u0027Fools, Athens is doomed!\u0027, you shout to them \u0027I saw the enemies myself, I fought them. There are just to many of them. Our only hope is to flee the city through this gate.\u0027 You armor and bleeding shoulder seem to impress the gathered people. Two other wounded soldiers run to the gates to open them. \u0027I hope you know what you\u0027re doing.\u0027, one of them says to you.\n\n\nWhen the gates open you see an almost deserted landscape. Only a handful of soldiers are left behind to make sure no one flees through these gates. Well, now they\u0027ll have to work for their money.\n\n\nWith the strength of a cornered lion, you, the two other soldiers and the gathered citizens attack the enemies. A few minutes later the enemies lie dead on the sandy soil, only two citizens have died in the attack.\n\n\nYou walk all day, always away from Athens. When night falls you camp on a hill. While the other refugees slowly fall to sleep, exhausted from the day\u0027s fighting and walking, you can\u0027t. Although the bleeding has stopped, moving your shoulder is still painful.\n\n\nYou gaze to the distant horizon and see the burning remains of what was the mighty city of Athens. In the inferno you see a flash of golden light coming from the hill that once housed the Parthenon. As you witness the destruction of your home you wonder if this could have been averted.\n",
  "page 10": "You pick up your dropped shield and hurry back to the top of the walls. But before you even reach the staircase you hear a loud cracking to your left. As you look at the source of the noise you see splinters coming off of the city gates.\n\n\nWith a thundering crack the gates give way to the Spartan battering ram. At the same time a wave of Spartan soldiers comes flooding through the destroyed gates. You raise your shield and fight valiantly against the endless stream of enemies. Even with your useless arm you manage to injure quite a lot of enemies by smashing your shield at them.\n\n\nSuddenly you see general Polymachos fighting next to you. \u0027Cover my back!\u0027, he shouts at you, just when the spear of an enemy hits him in the chest. You gaze with horror at the sight of the swift-footed Polymachos, the most-experienced general of Athens, lying dead at the floor. While you are astounished by this sight an enemy manages to sneak up to you. As you finally realise what is going on he strikes you with his sword.\n\n\nAs your soul prepares to leave your body to journey to the realm of Hades you spot a golden light in the corner of your vision.

You see your fellow defenders fighting with the courage and strength of mountain lions, but they are clearly outnumbered. To your right you see the lion-hearted Polymachos defending against an attack by multiple opponents and to your left you see a couple of Athenian soldiers who are being slaughtered by the Spartan attackers.\n\n\nAs you are about to lose all hope of winning this fight a huge soldiers comes into your view, wielding a large sword.

Together, you fight bravely against the invading Spartans and after about half an hour most of the invaders are repelled from the city, the battle has moved outside the city walls.\n\n\nHowever, the enemy hasn\u0027t retreated yet.

The battle rages on for a couple of minutes. After you kill a couple of soldiers you notice that the battlefield is getting quiet. The battle cries of the solders have died down.

At closer inspection you see it is the body of the lion-hearted Polymachos. Apparently he died, fighting an enemy general\n\n\nAthens doesn\u0027t rejoice at the fact that another wave of attackers has been repelled. Many brave men died and many more are wounded. The cries of widows can be heard around the clock and the smoke from the funerary pyres seems to block out the sun. You cannot stand the sight of this city of death any more. A few moments later you find yourself walking aimlessly across the battlefield. You have no idea how you ended up here. As you walk around the battlefield, occasionally startling one of the carrion eaters that now roam the lands, you think about the slaughter that has been done here the past couple of days.

However, you see a completely different sight. Thousands of footmen, carrying the swift bronze spears flood the nearby countryside. Hundreds of riders and their swift-hoofed horses pour from behind the enemy lines. Hordes of archers, pulling the strings on their bows flow from behind the horizon. At this sight your heart sinks with despair. How could the wounded city of Athens ever withstand a force like this.

A mere week ago you were telling stories in Athens\u0027 odeon and now you are leading an expedition to the oracle of Thebes!\n\n\nAfter that faithful night on top of the acropolis you left for the harbor of Piraeus. There, you found a mercenary who was willing to bring you to Thebes, for a steep price.  You tell your friends and family you are going to travel to distant courts to show off your knowledge of poetry. Then, nothing is left to hold you back from your journey, after a quick prayer to Athena, the patron goddess of Athens, you sail away on the mercenary ship.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u0027Sir, we are about to enter the Nile river, we will reach Thebes in a few days.

You count thousands and thousand of men, all carrying weapons. You drop to the ground in utter despair.

As the sun gives way to the starry night sky you curl up on your sleeping mat, feeling the emptiness of the ship pressing on your shoulders. Your dreams are troubled. Images of the events of the past day are flashing through your mind, bringing guilt along with them. The golden glow of a divine presence this time does not relieve you of your troubled thoughts. The angry image of the cloudgatherer Zeus pops into your mind. A crown made of lightning bolts rests upon his grey hair, twisting and contorting as a nest of angry snakes.\n\n\n\u0027Cowardly bard, despicable craven, shame of Athens.

Although, to be honest: I like them more as pigs.\u0027\n\n\nThe next half hour she goes through the big hall, tapping each and every pig on their heads with her wand and muttering incantations. Finally, all your companions are returned to their original selves. Afterwards, Circe approaches you. \u0027My noble hero I understand I\u0027ve caused you and your friends a lot of trouble, and I am deeply sorry for it. Please, let me make it up to you by letting you stay here for a while, to rest and to regain your strength for the rest of your journey. I promise by the immortal gods that I won\u0027t harm any of you, else they may take my soul and lock it away in the Tartaros, the deepest pit of the underworld.\n\n\nAfter a quick decision with your men you decide to accept Circe\u0027s offer and spend some time on her island to regain your strength. Your men each get spacious rooms assigned, but you sleep in Circe\u0027s own chambers. You dine exquisitely each day (although you are never served pork) and Circe is the perfect host, with no intentions whatsoever of hurting anyone. The time between meals you spend with Circe, walking on her beautiful island, playing games beneath a pergola while enjoying the cool breeze from the sea or take a swim in the beautiful blue waves. Everything is just so perfect, you never want to leave.\n\n\nHowever, eventually the time comes when the gods have grown tired of waiting for you to resume your journey and they send Hermes to command you so. As you and Circe reach the top of the marble staircase that leads to her mansion you see the keen-eyed messenger of the gods standing before you. \u0027Noble bard, the immortal gods have sent me to bring you a message. You must continue your journey to Sparta or Greece will be destroyed by the flames of war. I advice you to do as they say.\u0027\n\n\nYou look to Circe, ready to say goodbye, but when you see her sad but beautiful face you hesitate. Seeing the hesitation in your eyes she speaks to you despairingly: \u0027Please, my noble hero, you do not have to leave me. Stay here and live here with me until the end of days. You like it here, you said so yourself during one of our walks. Please... please consider it.\u0027\n\n\nHermes speaks sternly to you: \u0027Remember your journey, mortal. Remember those who depend on you. You have to leave, now!\u0027\n\n\nTorn between your duty and your newly found love for Circe you decide...\n",

Between her sobs she speaks to you, still holding you captive in her embrace: \u0027You know, I really loved that man. But I realize that he won\u0027t come back. You are not him and you will never be able to replace him in my heart. At least he was clever, and you aren\u0027t. He would never have fallen for such a transparent trap.\u0027\n\n\nYou see bronze glimmering in the corner of your eye. As you realize what Circe is planning to do you try to wrestle free from her grip, but it is to no avail. The love-maddened goddess has taken of of the knives from the dining tables and makes sure you never leave her mansion again. The marble floor feel cold against your skin as your red life force is being drained from your body, the beautiful white floor turning slowly red.\n\n\nBefore you trade in the mortal world for the underworld you see Circe playing with the bloody knife, muttering incomprehensibly to herself.\n",

Circe has given you new supplies so you can resume your journey to Sparta.\n\n\nOn top of the white marble steps, with the sun setting beneath the horizon in the east, you gave each other your farewell kisses. The creeping chill of the evening marked your parting. Circe waited on the beach until your ship set sail, watching you as you watched her. But now you are both out of sight of each other. The dream has ended, your break is over, and now you have to continue your journey.\n\n\nThe winds are blowing again and the stars are clear, giving guidance to your crew. Shaking your sad thoughts away you walk towards the navigator: \u0027Set sail towards Sparta, don\u0027t make any stops until we\u0027ve arrived at their docks.\u0027\n\n\n \n",
  "page 205": "You are standing on top of the marble stairs, watching your ship sail away in the distance. With a sad heart you said goodbye to the men you\u0027ve experienced so much together with.

The seas and the battle are our homes, we weren\u0027t made to stay put in one place.\u0027 Circe left you alone, to say your goodbyes and to reminisce about your past adventures, but now she walks towards you. \u0027Come, my love, please let happiness drive the sadness from your heart.\u0027\n\n\nYou follow her advice and try to forget the sad goodbye. You are happy here, on this beautiful island with the woman you love, yet you keep this doubt hidden into the deepest parts of your heart that you should have continued your journey.\n\n\n---\n\n\nYears go by and you and Circe still live happily together on the island. One more time Hermes has come to you, pleading you to continue the task given to you by the gods but you just dismissed him. Athena visited you in your dreams once, telling you the largest part of the Greek States were engulfed by war, but wishing you good luck and much happiness none the less. Life has been blissful to you, you can\u0027t even remember the last time you were sad. You\u0027ve truly left your past life behind you and you and Circe live happily together until the end of time itself.\n",

This offense to the gods can still be forgiven if you stop at once.\u0027\n\n\nThe doubt in the faces of the crew members turns to utter fear.

You hear the desperate prayers of the crew members, praying for food or rain, and it pains you that you are unable to aid them.\n\n\nEven Cyrus, who supported you throughout your journey is starting to doubt.

Fertile, yes, with lots of oxen walking upon it. And fresh water! Lots of it.\u0027\n\n\nYou grumble. \u0027Calm yourself down.

So you order the crew to tie you to the mast, that way you can\u0027t do anything foolish, while you are still able to listen to the song.\n\n\nA few minutes later you pass a large rock, crowded with strange creatures. They look like women, but have bird wings and a fierce look in their eyes. As they spot your ship they lift up from the rock and circle above your ship, trying to tempt you to offer yourself to them.

You are the one person who can save the Greek cities from the fires of war. You have travelled far and you have accomplished many thing, but your journey has not yet come to an end. Athena, the protector of heroes, has persuaded the council of the gods to send me to this island, to order Calypso to release you. You are now free to go, free to continue your journey.\u0027\n\nYou look at Calypso to ask if this is true, but her face, filled with grief, tells you enough. Her voice, filled with sadness speaks to you: \u0027Dear guest, Hermes speaks the truth. The gods have ordered me to let you go. But I ask you...no, I beg you to reconsider my offer. Stay here, with me. Forget Greece, forget your journey, stay here with me and be happy. If you knew what the future holds for you you would stay here. You will suffer, even after you reach your destination and the wrath of Poseidon will follow you across the sea. Stay here, be safe, accompany me as my husband, until the end of time itself.\u0027\n\nYour heart is torn between your duty to the gods and the offer of Calypso. Your mind tells you to continue your journey, but your heart tells you to stay here. The gods have freed you and Calypso, even while she is in love with you, has obeyed them. In front of these two deities you have to make a choice that will shape the rest of your life.\n\nYou answer with a trembling voice:\n",

You are sitting once again on your spot on the beach, gazing at the horizon, wishing for a miracle to happen. Ever since you rejected Calypso she has been trying to seduce you with her sweet words and beautiful promises. She has given you the finest clothes and the best food, but your heart is still filled with worries about Greece.\n\nNo matter how sorrowful you feel here, on this island-prison, you can\u0027t help but notice that Ogygia is really an extraordinary place. The most majestic birds make their nests in the large trees that scatter the island and the sweetest fruits grow just within an arms length. The seas surrounding it are full of fat fish and the skies are always blue. However, not a day goes by in which you stop praying to the gods for a sign, a miracle to happen that will bring you to your goal so you can fulfil your journey.\n\nYou suddenly hear the sad voice of Calypso calling for you: \u0027Noble traveller, please join me in my home. You have a visitor.\u0027\n\nCurious, you make your way to the cave of Calypso. Who, but the immortal gods themselves could make their way to the island of the goddess Calypso?\n\nAs you enter the lavishly decorated cave your attention is immediately caught by an unfamiliar man standing next to Calypso. He wears the hat of a traveller and he carries the staff of a negotiator. On his feet he wears winged sandals. You suddenly recognise him as Hermes, the messenger of the gods.\n",

You turn around and spot the enraged priestess, brandishing a deadly bronze spear. You immediately can see that she is untrained with the weapon.\n\n\nWith a quick feint you manage to disarm her. The priestess mutters curses as her weapon plunges to the ground and you hold your sword dangerously close to her throat. Eventually she calms down and speaks: \u0027Very well, you have defeated me. But I still can\u0027t help you. The gods are not pleased with you and so they have clouded my vision. I am not able to see your future, however, there is another way for you to find a solution for your problems. At the edge of the world there stands a rock, at the convergence of two great streams. There the world of the living and the realm of Hades cross-over. There you will have to sacrifice to the dead, for in the underworld a great seer resides, Teirisias is his name. But be careful, other souls will appear, wanting to eat and drink of your sacrifice, but you must fend them off until Teiresias has eaten from it. He will be able to assist you in your goal. I sincerely apologise for my earlier behaviour and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your odyssey.

I use this vessel to completely separate myself from the civilized world, so I can completely focus on my study and the worship of the great Apollo.

Well, too bad, but he died. You are going to marry me today or both you and your son will die. Do you understand?

Yet, you are no ordinary visitor, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027You are right, my lady, but how did you know?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027This may sound strange, but my late husband came to me last night. He appeared in my dreams. He told me a great danger threatened me and my poor son, Kourio. You see, dark clouds are gathering above Sparta. My husband has died, leaving me alone to raise our only child, his heir. I believe he was murdered. You see, the council of elders, the advisors of the king, want us to declare war on the other Greek city states, claiming the supremacy over the whole of Greece. My husband was opposed to this. I believe Akakios, an evil man and the most influential of the elders was behind his assassination. Ever since my husbands death he has tried to persuade me to marry either him or any of the other elders. However, though I am a woman, I am no fool. Akakios wants the sole rulership over Sparta and I think he\u0027ll murder me and my son if that is was it takes. I only managed to win some time by telling my suitors I wouldn\u0027t be ready to marry anyone until I finish the burial cloth you can see over there. It\u0027s meant for my husbands fater, who has fallen gravely ill. The whole day I would work on it, only to undo all that work each night. But now the suitors found out about it and are demanding a marriage.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027That is a sad tale indeed, noble lady, but it does not explain how you knew of my coming.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027My husband told me a messenger was coming, sent by the immortal gods themselves. One who, despite his humble origins, would be able to put a stop to Akakios\u0027 malicious plans and bring peace to Sparta. It\u0027\u0027s hard to explain, but when I saw you I knew you were the one my dear husband meant.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027You are right, I was sent by the gods to prevent a civil war between the Greek city states. However, I do not have the power, nor the knowledge to interfere in the politics of Sparta.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Then we\u0027ll just have to work together\u0027, a youthful voice speaks.\n\n\nYou turn around and see a youth entering the room, about fourteen years you guess. He has the looks of his mother, the same brown hair and brown eyes and a fair complexion.\n\n\nNelei speaks to you: \u0027May I introduce you to my son, Kourio, rightful heir to the kingdom of Sparta, direct descendant to the great king Menelaos. Kourio, this is the envoy your father told me about.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Then this must be a sign that we will finally be able to put a halt to the evil plans of Akakios. Together, we will be able to figure something out, a ruse, to eliminate these pests from our grand city once and for all.\u0027\n\n\nThe three of you deliberate all night and eventually you come up with a plan that will hopefully prevent civil war.\n",
  "page 219": "Putting all your weight behind your thrust you try to end Akakios\u0027 life with a single blow. Yet Akakios is faster. A sharp pain erupts as the bronze sword pierces your intestine. You fall to the ground, coughing up blood. Akakios looms over you with a malicious grin. You manage to see the bronze sword flicker in the afternoon sun before it buries itself into your brains.\n\n\nYou have travelled a long and dangerous road. You braved many perils and have seen many new places. But although you were close to your goal you didn\u0027t make it. Greece is doomed and Athens will be engulfed by flames. Yet you won\u0027t notice any of this, as your soul is already on it\u0027s way to Hades. May you find peace there, while the world of the mortals is at war.\n",
  "page 65": "Men and women with pale, blood-drained faces rise up from the realm of Hades. You hear the crew members behind cower with fear and retreat to the ship. You notice that only Cyrus remains behind.\n\n\nThe souls immediately close in on the sacrifice. With a flash you remember you can\u0027t let the other souls eat of the sacrifice until Teirisias has dined. You quickly pull out your sword.\n\n\nThe souls of the deceased keep their distance for a moment, but they still slowly creep up to the sacrifice.\n\n\nWith the greatest effort you manage to keep calm as hundreds of souls encircle you. Tightly clutching your sword you notice that the spirits of the dead keep creeping closer to you.\n\n\nThe sight of their hollow eyes and pale skin makes you despair. As the cold inhabitants of the underworld encircle you you drop your sword, waiting for their cold hands to drag you to the realm of Hades.\n\n\nSuddenly a golden light illuminates the island, startling the ghosts and filling you with the golden glow. You feel as if the goddess Athena has taken away the fear from your limbs and with a renewed courage you storm the bewildered souls.\n",
  "page 218": "Akakios dodges the arrow, which lodges itself into the chest of the suitor behind him. He draws a sharp, bronze sword and the other suitors follow his lead. Nelei retreats into her chambers, locking the doors behind her. You quickly step forth, out of the shadows drawing your own deadly sword.\n\n\nYou are immediately attacked by two suitors, slashing at you with their sharp swords. However, you easily block their blows, finishing off one of your attackers with a quick thrust to his chest. The other suitor retreats, only to be replaced by three more attackers. Although you do your best trying to block their attacks, you still get shallow cuts along your arms and sides.\n\n\nSuddenly the head of one of your attackers explodes in a flurry of brain and blood as a feathered arrow sends another of the suitors to Hades. Taking advantage of the confusion you thrust your sword into the chest of another attacker, ending his life. The remaining attacker drops his sword and cowers away, but he too is slain by Kourio\u0027s swift bow.\n\n\nYou see a glimmer of bronze in the corner of your eye and you barely manage the deadly thrust of Akakios\u0027 sword. But as you try to regain your stance he already prepares another attack. As he once more unleashes a deadly thrust in your direction you have only a split second to take action. Acting more on instinct than on your wits you...\n",
  "page 68": "Too bad, but we have to set sail immediately, time is running out for Greece. The crew sigh softly from relieve, apparently they had a bad feeling about that cave.\n\n\nYou and Cyrus stand at the bow of the ship, looking at the distant horizon. As you stand there you can\u0027t but wonder who inhabited that far-away island. But on the other hand, despite your curiosity you too were a little frightened by the cave.\n\n\nThe events of the day have left you tired and you quickly fall asleep. In your dreams you find youself floating above the wine-coloured sea. Violent winds blow right through you and the restless sea sends his waves to the clouded skies above. \n\n\nYou notice a glowing figure standing next to you. As you watch closer you recognize the bright-eyed Athena. She turns her head to you and speaks the winged words: \u0027Great bard, you have chosen wisely not to venture into the cave on the far-away island, for a terrible monster inhabits it, Polyphemos, the son of Poseidon. But your journey is not over yet and many dangerous fill the roads ahead.\u0027\n\n\nShe points down to two distant shapes in the dark night, lining a narrow passage between two great patches of land. \n\n\n\u0027On the left is the terrible Charybdis, a monster that spawns terrible currents. On the right is the dreadful Scyla, a beast with six heads that attacks all ships that passes it. Choose carefully, the way ahead is long and Greece counts on you.\u0027\n\n\n \n",
  "page 67": "You order one of the crew members to fetch a sack of wine as a meeting gift for the inhabitant of the cave.\n\nTogether with Cyrus and seven men you make way to the large cave. When you get close to the cave you wonder at the makeshift pens, although there is no signs of the animals. Although the construction seems terribly shaky, you notice that it is more stable than it seems. But your biggest surprise comes when you step over the threshold of the \u0027\u0027house\u0027\u0027. On the walls there are racks and shelves filled with cheese. Baskets of fruit litter the floor of the cave and buckets of milk fill one side of the cave. Whoever lives here, he is either very wealthy or very hungry.\n\nAlthough it is against your better judgment, you and your men take some of the cheese and drink some of the milk. After the scrumptious meal you hear thundering footstep closing in on the cave. Fear grips your heart and the hearts of your men as you imagine what kind of terrible beast produces such sound. You quickly hide in the shadows at the back of the cave, awaiting the inhabitant of the shelter.\n\nThen, the owner arrives. A large foot enters though the entrance, followed by a huge leg. A man, as large as three grown men, enters the cave. As you examine the stranger more closely you notice he only has one eye, right in the middle of his forehead. He is followed by dozens of sheep and goats. After he places the male animals into the pens outside the cave, he rolls a huge stone in front of the doorway, well there goes that escape route. Luckily for you, he doesn\u0027t seem to miss the cheese and milk that you took.\n\nToo afraid to approach the creature, you watch him care for his sheep with loving care. He carefully milks the animals. Afterwards he feeds them. As the huge man takes a seat on a flat rock you finally dare to step out of the shadows.\n\n\u0027Greetings noble host. I would like to introduce myself to you. I am a humble bard from the city of Athens, sent on a mission by the gods themselves. I have traveled far and wide before I came here with my men, and we have faced many perils. I\u0027m sorry to tell you, but as we awaited you return we took some cheese and some milk. I\u0027d like to ask you if you could give us some supplies for our way back, after all it is our right, since we are your guest.\u0027\n\nThe huge man examines you closer, scanning you from your head to your toes with his giant eye. \u0027Well, great bard, let me first welcome you to my home and let me thank you for your company, you see it is quite lonely here on this island. You mentioned you came here with your men, where exactly are they?\u0027\n\n\u0027Some of them are here, o noble host\u0027, and your men appear from the shadows \u0027but the rest of my crew is at the beach.\u0027\n\n\u0027I see. And may I ask how you reached our island. After all, the wide seas encircle it and you would need a well build ship to come here.\u0027\n\nYou become quite suspicious of your host and so you answer him: \u0027our ship was wrecked at sea by high waves and strong winds. After our ship was completely wrecked by the god of the seas, we were thrown ashore on your island.\u0027\n\n\u0027Well, you\u0027re lucky that you ended up here and not on some uninhabited island. Please, make yourself at home, I was about to dine and you, as my very honoured guests, must join me.\u0027\n",
  "page 69": "You wake up the next day after a peaceful nights sleep.\n\n\nAs you slowly open your eyes, blinking from the bright morning sun, you notice Cyrus standing next to your sleeping mat. \u0027Good morning sir, I hope that you slept well. I have taken the liberty to arrange a meeting with the Oracle for you today. And don\u0027t worry, we won\u0027t charge you extra money for this service.\u0027 He adds with a wink.\n\n\nAbout an hour later you are standing in front of the shrine of the priestess of Zeus. The shrine is a large imposing circular structure made out of gleaming white marble. As you admire the building, the huge bronze doors open to reveal the priestess of Zeus. She wears a long white robe and a bronze necklace around her neck and she is of great beauty. She looks like one of the immortal gods, who own the great sky, herself. She approaches you very solemnly, holding an incense burner while muttering prayers to the cloud gatherer Zeus.\n\n\nYou hesitate to address her, afraid to interrupt a sacred ceremony. So you just keep standing on your spot, watching the priestess and waiting until she is finished. When the priestess has almost reached you notice a boy behind her, holding a honey cake. The priestess stops, but the boy approached you with the cake, offering it to you. As he leaves he says just one word: \u0027eat\u0027.\n\n\nAfter you finish the sweet cake a girl approaches you with a bowl filled with water. She holds the bowl in front of you and says just one word: \u0027wash\u0027.\n\n\nAfter having washed your hands the priestess of the almighty Zeus finally approaches you. She speaks with a kind voice, but you can hear she is used to speak with powerful men and you detect some hints of conceit. \u0027Welcome, traveller. The gods have revealed to me in an oracle that you would come to me. That is why you, a commoner are given this last-minute divination. You have powerful friends among the gods, I can tell you that. Now, listen closely to what the gods have chosen to reveal to you through me:\n\n\n\u0027You have started a journey with dangers above your imagination. However, it is your fate to succeed. Stay true to your heart and refrain from angering the gods and you will reach your destination. In the lands of the Spartans there is a great palace. Is\u0027s inhabitant, the great king Agatos, has been betrayed by his courtiers. Now, the flame of war has ignited the hearts of the Spartans, the flame that will engulf the whole of Greece if left unchecked.\u0027\n\n\nThis is what the gods revealed to me. I understand what a terrible burden the gods have placed on your shoulders and I wish I could relieve some of it. My servants will serve you a banquet before you leave, I wish you good luck.\u0027\n\n\nWith these words she retreats into the temple.\n\n\n \n",
  "page 60": "You open your eyes and notice the whole crew working very hard. Everyone seems to be in a tense mood. After you stand up from your sleeping mat you grab one of the crew members by his wrist.\n\n\n\u0027Tell me, what is happening? Why is everyone so tense?\u0027\n\n\n\u0027Well, ehm, sir, I really have to get back to my post, or captain Cyrus will flay me alive.\u0027 He is about to leave, but you grip his wrist tighter.\n\n\n\u0027Look, Cyrus won\u0027t hurt you, but I will if I don\u0027t get an answer soon.\u0027\n\n\n\u0027O...okay sir. Well, a strange storm has suddenly turned up. Our sails are almost ripping and the current is too strong for our rowers to combat. We are at the mercy of the swift winds. However, we are trying our best to fight against these forces of nature.\u0027 The crew member now seems frightened. You let go of his wrist and he immediately walks away.\n\n\n\u0027Fools!\u0027 you mutter to yourself. \u0027Everyone listen to me!\u0027 you shout across the deck, this seems to catch the attention of the crew. \u0027Stop fighting against the wind. The gods have blessed us with these fair winds, for they will swiftly take us to our destination. The first person who will defy these orders will be punished by the captain himself.\u0027 The crew immediately leave their posts and look around, wondering what they have to do.\n\n\nYou suddenly hear laughing behind you and notice Cyrus walking towards you. \u0027Traveler, I consider you my good friend, but you are not captain of my ship and my crew. I don\u0027t mind you giving advice to my crew or helping them with their work, but please, don\u0027t order them around. My authority will be undermined and I might have to copy some behavior from the former captain.\u0027 He winks at the last sentence. \u0027Alright you scum, you heard our guest. Everyone who tries to steer our ship or to hinder it in any way will be thrown will immediately be released from service. And there is no place on this ship for traitors.\u0027\n\n\nHe turns to you once again. \u0027They are good people, but they still are mercenaries. Turn your back on them and you\u0027ll end up with a knife in your back. But why would we have this gloomy mood? Come on, let us... What the... What did I just say you ignorant nitwit?\u0027 You look around, trying to find the person Cyrus is shouting at. Then you spot a young crew member, who may just has reached adulthood, holding a oar. Cyrus grabs the oar from his hands. \u0027Let this be an example for everyone who defies my orders!\u0027 He lift the oar and lets it come come down on the back of the young man, repeating this motion over and over again.\n\n\nTears begin to well up in the eyes of the poor boy. \u0027Please sir, I was just frightened. I swear I\u0027ll never do it again.\u0027 Cyrus doesn\u0027t seem to take any notice of the boy and keeps hitting him with the oar. While you watch this process you shout at Cyrus:\n",
  "page 62": "Cyrus keeps hitting the boy, holding the oar high above his head, encouraged by your shouts.\n\n\nYou are too absorbed in the \u0027disciplinary punishment\u0027 of the young boy to notice the growing resentment of the crew members. Behind your back, the disgruntled crew members gather. When you finally notice what is going on the first fist hits you in your stomach. You bend over as the air is forced from your lungs. You collapse as another fist hits you on your head.\n\n\nAs you wake up a few moments later you notice that you and Cyrus are tied together with your wrists. A big crew members towers over you. \u0027Wake up, wake up sleepy. It\u0027s time to play. Who is up for a little bit of swimming.\u0027\n\n\nThe next moments pass by in a flash. The crew lifts you up and before you realise what exactly is going on you find yourself sinking beneath the waves.\n\n\nYou jerk at the ropes that are immobilizing your hands, trying to loosen them. But it is of no use.\n\n\nYour sight blackens as the last air flows from you lungs. The body of Cyrus grows limb as he too struggles for oxygen. The last thing you see is the last of your breath, leaving your body in a string of bubbles. The last seconds before your soul travels to the realm of Hades are filled with torment as you struggle against the cold embrace of the ocean surrounding you.\n",
  "page 61": "Cyrus seems impervious to your comment and he keeps on hitting the poor boy.\n\n\nYou can\u0027t stand the sight of your friend hitting the boy any longer and so you step towards Cyrus and hit him in the face with your fist. Like he wakes up from a waking dream, Cyrus comes to his senses. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t know what I was doing. The gods must have blinded me. I am so terribly sorry.\u0027 His cheeks redden as he apologizes once again to the boy and retreats to his quarters.\n\n\nOnce everyone fully grasped what just happened, a man approaches you. You guess he is a member of the crew, although you have never seen him, and a strange sense of authority hangs around him.  While you observe the strange man he speaks to you:\n\n\n\u0027Well done mortal. You have shown compassion for a person in need. You have regained the favour of the gods. But the warning of my daughter, the owl-eyed Athena, still stands. Help your fellow men and respect the gods, or you, and the rest of the Greek world shall be destroyed.\u0027\n\n\nYou are briefly distracted by the cries of a nearby bird, but when you turn back to the stranger he seems to have disappeared. Who was this man?\n\n\n \n",
  "page 63": "Days pass by and Cyrus slowly regains the confidence of the crew. The days pass by without any notable events. You enjoy the calm waves and the fair winds that carry you and guide you on your journey. You marvel at the animals that populate the vast, wine-coloured ocean and the wide skies. During these days you get better acquainted with the crew and you start to feel like you\u0027re on a holiday.\n\n\nBut then the skies grow darker and darker. The animals disappear and the moral of the crew grows sadder and darker. A week after you left Thebes you finally reach the place where you can consult the dead seer Teiresias. You ask Cyrus to fetch food from the cargo hold, to offer to the souls of the dead. With Cyrus and a couple of crew members in your rear and the food in your hands you set foot upon the strange island.\n\n\nThe air is dead silent, not a sound is heard apart from the easy wind. A chill creeps up your spine as you look around the barren land. Not a living thing appears in your vision, not even the lean trees or the though shrubbery survive in this harsh place. Silently and in anticipation you dig a shallow hole in the sand. You take the food and mix it with some red wine. Not long after you call upon the dead you hear a sorrowful moaning spreading through the air. A cold wind sweeps across the barren island and the crew members behind you shiver. A sense of fear and despair spreads across the hearts of the men as the souls of the departed rise from the realm of Hades.\n",

Your travels have given you a tremendous amount of experience, yet you need all of it in your duel with your enemy.
