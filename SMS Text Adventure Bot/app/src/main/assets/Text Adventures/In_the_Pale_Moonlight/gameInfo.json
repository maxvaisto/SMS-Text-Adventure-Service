["47","In the Pale Moonlight","Steve24833","6","5","6.70","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/In_the_Pale_Moonlight.aspx","There are men in this world who were born to have the weight of the world on their shoulders, to have the horrors of the night carved into their souls, to see what shouldn\u0027t be seen and to defeat it. You are one of those men. You are a Hunter.\nThere are dark things that plague the night, things beyond what any soul should have to deal with. Things made from darkness and nightmares, things that feed upon the blood and flesh of the innocent, things that rule the night and loathe the living. These are your prey.\nIt is the night of your thirteenth hunt. It is time for you to take up your arms and to do what needs to be done, and make sure it\u0027s safe to walk at night once more.\nThis is an entry for the Creatures of the Night contest. There\u0027s thirteen endings to find, so good luck finding them. Thanks for playing, and above all, enjoy!"]
