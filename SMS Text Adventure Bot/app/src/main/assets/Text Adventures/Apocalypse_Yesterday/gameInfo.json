  "2015 Competition entry.\nYou are in a post apocalyptic world desperately trying to keep yourself going by searching the crumbled ruins of what used to be, hell you don\u0027t know, just some huge city that used to be important. You know you have a goal now to get across the city to an area you heard a survivor talk about before they died, lots of people there, a whole community of survivors. So now all you think about it reaching it. The only trouble is surviving long enough to get there yourself.\n******************************************\nSomething I must say here is that I have entered this right before the deadline and made it the best I could given the time restrictions however this is far from finished. It will most likely be riddled with spelling and grammar errors and there is even a distinct possibility of a page being linked wrong. If so I am sorry, however I said I would write something playable by the deadline and while it falls so far short of my own standards that it actually hurts to hit the publish button I feel that I have to.\nSome paths might appear to rail-road you or kill you off prematurely, this is sadly because I was unable to finish them or they were the openings to newer arcs and had to be severed to have something to publish without broken end links.\nI shall work on this story over the coming months and republish it later once it is finished. for reference this is at most roughly 1/3 of the final game plan..."
