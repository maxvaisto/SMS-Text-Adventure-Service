Then, the greatest noble. Now, a washed up drunkard past his prime. But when the king asks for you to turn the tide of a war, will you accept, or cast his offer aside to walk your own path?\n\nAuthor\u0027s Notes: I originally intended for every single choice to branch out into a unique path, but to get this out I had to cut some of my plans short. There is minor rebranching here and there along with a few duplicate pages that have minor changes depending on how you reached those pages. On top of that, the path for accepting the king\u0027s offer is much more bare bones than I wanted it to be and is only about a third of the rest of the game\u0027s size (10k to the rest of the game\u0027s 30k). Someday, I hope to return to this story and make it the epic it deserves to be. For now, however, the game is finished.\n\nThe SCORE variable doesn\u0027t indicate how good you did. It\u0027s just a way to keep track of what ending the reader got.\n\nIf you play the game, please give a comment.
