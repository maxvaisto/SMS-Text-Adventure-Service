  "page 33": "You head down to the cellar and start constructing your still while trying to remember everything you learned in those chemistry classes. The main thing is to make something strong that isn’t going to make folks go blind.\n\n\n\nYou work on it over the course of several days during your spare time as the real alcohol supply dwindles down. Eventually after a mixture of sugar, yeast, potatoes and bunch of other stuff you’ve taken from the garbage, you’re fairly confident you’ve made enough of this stuff to last you by the time you get the proper shipment.\n\n\n\nYou haven’t exactly been telling your mother what you’ve been doing, but the smell has been getting to the point that it’s starting to invade the kitchen.\n\n\n\n“Ugh! It smells awful down here, and I hope you aren’t doing what I think you’re doing.”\n\n“I had to, besides it’s finished now and I think this batch has come out pretty good.”\n\n“Smells like rotting garbage!”\n\n“Well some of it is, but trust me I think this will tide us over.”\n\n\n\nHoping for the best, you and your mother release this new brew to the clientele. You do have the decency to warn them that it’s new, but they’re always willing to try anything once.\n\n\n\nThe moonshine brew goes over well, more or less. A few think it’s a lot more bitter, but it’s not enough to drive anyone away since they’re all getting drunk at a quicker rate.\n\n\n\nMr. Reynolds receives his payment and by the end of the month you’ve got your usual shipment. The problem is you won’t be saving money like you were going to while Calwin was your supplier. Your nice rooms haven’t really been helping like you thought they might and while you can keep on this way, you’re never really going to get ahead.\n\n\n\nThe thought of continuing to work here any longer is disheartening to you. Maybe you’re just being impatient, but after all the problems and headaches you’ve encountered you really don’t feel like dealing with this job anymore, especially not when there is potential danger constantly looming overhead. You’re ready to tell your mother to just sell the place.\n\n\n\nThe only other thing you can think of to cut costs to a degree that will speed up the process is to continue using the still and not bother with buying from the Klyton supplier in the future.\n",
  "page 32": "“Do you think you’d still be able to get a good price for this place?” you ask your mother.\n\n“Yeah, but not before next payment! That’s why we just need to get out of the city now!”\n\n\n\nYou grab what payment you can afford and start heading for the door.\n\n\n\n“What’re you doing?!”\n\n“I’m going to see Mr. Reynolds early.”\n\n“What?! You can’t! He’ll kill you!”\n\n“No, he’ll have me beaten. Look, if we leave he’s just going to track us down and he probably will kill us by that time. If I pay him this now, I’ll take a beating, but he’s going to figure I’m still a source of income for him. We can then pay it off completely when you sell this place. Afterwards, well we’ll see what happens.”\n\n\n\nYour mother still doesn’t want you to go, but you’re determined so she doesn’t stand in your way. You walk several blocks into bad neighborhoods half expecting to get mugged on your way to see him, but for once luck is on your side. Mr. Reynolds sits at his desk counting coins with both of his goons beside him as usual.\n\n\n\n“Well this is unexpected, what can I do for you today m’boy?”\n\n“This is all we can afford for this payment. I guarantee the next one will be much bigger.” You say plopping the bag of coins on his desk.\n\n\n\nHe lifts the bag and frowns at its weight.\n\n“Feels a little light kid. You do realize what’s going to happen next right?”\n\n“Yes, that’s why I came early to get it over with.” You say trying to sound brave.\n\n“Heh, you’re trying your best to be brave, but I know deep down inside you’re terrified. It’s okay, you should be. (Sigh) Olaf. Reggie. Just beat him up, don’t break any bones, I’m in a good mood today.”\n\n\n\nOlaf approaches you with a little disappointment that he doesn’t get to break any bones today, but he still takes glee in punching you in the face. Reggie picks you up and holds you while Olaf beats on you some more. You try not to think about the pain, but instead try to think about how it’s absolutely amazing that Olaf manages to pull his punches enough that he doesn’t break anything. It’s the odd ogre that can show restraint during violence.\n\n\n\nOlaf does fail eventually though, when everyone hears an awful crunch sound and blood flies everywhere from your nose which is now completely broken.\n\n\n\n“Oh Olaf, I told you not to break anything! All right he’s had enough, drop him Reggie.” Mr. Reynolds orders and steps from his behind his desk to speak to you.\n\n\n\n“That’s two times I’ve been lenient kid. Next time, well for your sake there better not be a fucking next time because you’re not exactly the hardy type to take beatings like this. Olaf carry this kid back to his inn, he can’t make it home in his condition.”\n\n\n\nYou don’t even remember what happens in the next few moments since you’re drifting in and out of consciousness. When Olaf arrives at the inn he dumps your limp body inside and walks off. Your mother makes sure you’re still alive and somehow manages to get you to crawl to the bed of one of the empty rooms.\n\n\n\nDuring the remaining week the inn stays open to make a last bit of change before closing for good and selling to the city. Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn’t like how it used to be anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren’t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother finds work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can’t really stand living in the city without your father anymore. She leaves to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville, which is to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAfter a long time of the inn just sitting untended and forgotten due to the council having more pressing matters and red tape, it’s broken into by several homeless people who use it as a place to sleep. The homeless are soon ousted by a local gang who use it as a safe house. Eventually though they cause enough trouble that the Klyton Militia has to take severe action and storm the place, resulting in a small fire.\n\n\n\nAt this point someone in the council finally notices it, decides that the place isn’t worth salvaging and proposes that it be knocked down to build a medical clinic in its place to try to uplift the area. The motion passes.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you find a job thanks to your education level, but it isn’t anywhere in the field that you would’ve liked. You’re a clerk in tax office, filing away items, straightening out reports and such. You never really move up and you never make enough money to save away to get ahead either.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have a bad life so much as a mind numbingly mundane one. You do have your good days, but ultimately you never really achieve your goals and always have a sense of dissatisfaction with your life.\n\n\n\nSometimes you look back and wonder where you exactly went wrong with the inn and how you could’ve done things differently.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 76": "Mom’s idea seems the least underhanded so you decide to go with that. You realize that you’re going to have to spend more money in actually building the place up, but you figure that you’ll earn more in the long term.\n\n\n\nSo you start to build. It’s a lengthy and expensive process, and the Flying Griffon’s success hasn’t been slowing down and it’s starting to cut into your business. Meanwhile you’re having a hard time concentrating on your schoolwork due to all the stress, you start snapping at everyone which makes the overall atmosphere of the inn a little tense.\n\n\n\nEventually your additions get done, and for a while it helps, but ultimately you’ve spent more money than you’re gaining, because whatever the hell the Flying Griffon is doing, they’re still getting more customers. At this rate you won’t make enough to pay for your tuition and you’ll have to drop out again and that won’t exactly endear you to the university who frown upon such chaotic patterns to higher learning even you do manage to raise the money to get back in again.\n\n\n\nOne night it all comes crashing down.\n\n\n\n“Yes sir, you’ll get your breakfast in the morning at twenty five percent off, so that’s three gold and 4 silvers.” You tell a fat Delantium merchant.\n\n“Huh! Highway robbery for a place like this! But I suppose I have no choice as the Flying Griffon is filled up tonight…”\n\n“Flying Griffon…Flying Griffon…” you say with a smile before you grab the merchant by his throat.\n\n“Hey, ulp!”\n\n“You like the Flying fucking Griffon so much well get the fuck outta here and sleep in their doorway you fat piece of shit!” you shout, releasing the merchant roughly so he falls to the floor dropping his coins all over the place. Everyone in the place stops what they’re doing to watch your outburst.\n\n\n\nAs the merchant tries to get up and collect his dropped possessions, you grab your dad’s Troll Gun and point it at him telling him to hurry up or you’re going to blow his head off. At this point several of the Klyton Militia customers tell you to calm down and draw their own weapons, some of which have small flintlock pistols of their own. You mother and several of your staff pleads with you to calm down.\n\n\n\nIt works and the merchant leaves the inn as quickly as possible along with several other customers. The only ones who stay are the militia who insist that you hand over your weapon or they’ll actually arrest you. You comply and state you have to go lie down. When you get to your room you collapse on your bed and fall asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up the next day, you feel like you’re in a daze. You aren’t sure how you’re going to proceed, but your mother has already stepped in for you.\n\n\n\n“You’re selling the inn?” you say with a sense of familiarity.\n\n“Yes, I’m selling this place, it’s going to be the best thing for both of us! Especially you!”\n\n“Bullshit! You just don’t want to be here anymore! You’ve said it yourself! If you really cared about me, you’d try to help me with finishing my education. You know like YOU and DAD wanted me to? But why bother right? It was all fucked from the moment dad ran out of money and had to borrow from a loanshark. I never had a chance.”\n\n\n\nAt this point your mother takes your hand.\n\n\n\n“Son, I’m sorry. We really tried the best we could. We really did want the best for you, but maybe we just aimed too high and as a result you had a lot of pressure on you. I never thought I’d ever see you pull a gun on someone in anger. It was scary to see that side of you because I didn’t raise you to be that way. So I’m going to do the only thing I can think of to help you. I’m selling this inn and you can have ALL of the money I get from it. I don’t know if it’ll be enough that you’ll be able to finish up your classes, but maybe it’ll help. Now doesn’t that sound a little easier?”\n\n\n\nYou have to admit, it does though you’re still concerned about finances. Proper medical school is still really expensive, but you guess you’ll figure something out.\n\n\n\n“I just want you to know that if something doesn’t work out though, that you’ll always be welcome at your aunt’s house in Teckleville where I’m going to stay. I love you.”\n\n\n\nYou and your mom hug and at that point you feel a little weight lifted off your shoulders.\n\n\n\nYour mother ends up selling the inn to Frank, the owner of the Flying Griffon. He mentions that he’s a little surprised at the offer considering the new additions built onto the Traveller’s Inn, but he’s willing to pay more than the city will. It’s a lot, but not enough for medical school.\n\n\n\nYou decide maybe while you can’t be a doctor, maybe you can still choose something in medical field, presumably something you’ll be able to afford and not be as stressed all the time.\n\n\n\nYou ultimately become a veterinarian and feel a great sense of accomplishment. The only problem is they aren’t in great demand in Klyton and the few that do exist in the city have the market pretty much cornered, but you do know of a place where they might need one…\n\n\n\nYou move to Teckleville where you make a living treating farm animals and pets like kitties and puppies. Occasionally someone has something more exotic like a purple tailed glittermane, but it’s a quiet life for the most part. You eventually have a family and live the rest of your days there.\n\n\n\nSometimes you wonder what would’ve happened if you’d done things a bit differently at the inn, but all things considered it worked out.\n",
  "page 34": "You fought the good fight for as long as you could, but maybe it just wasn’t meant to be. You’re not going to finish this one, which is a familiar theme to you since you dropped out of college.

  "page 78": "Wendy’s idea requires almost no effort on your part and she’s right, if they are doing something illegal like Eliza suggested then the unexpected militia inspection should catch them off guard and in the act.\n\n\n\n“Okay let’s get some of our militia buddies to help us.” You say.\n\n\n\nWendy smiles and says she’s on good terms with one of the sergeants that drinks here and can easily persuade him to help. You mother doesn’t exactly approve of this and Rita’s not thrilled with you picking Wendy’s idea over hers, but everyone goes along with it.\n\n\n\nLater, Wendy speaks with Sergeant Keller, who is drinking with a few of his men at a corner table. You watch from the distance at get the impression that something more is going on between Wendy and the Sergeant, but whatever works right?\n\n\n\nWendy comes back with a slight smile on her face.\n\n\n\n“Well?”\n\n“He says he’ll do it, but not for free. He wants at least fifty silvers.”\n\n“What!?”\n\n“He says that while he’d love to just harass people on a daily basis he really can’t go around abusing his position like that, at least not without a little incentive.”\n\n“(Sigh) Yeah, yeah I get it, everyone’s gotta get paid. Fine, let me get it from the back, but for that amount of money he better do a good job.”\n\n“Oh don’t worry about that.”\n\n\n\nYou pay off the militia and get on with your work for the rest of night. You fully expect them to show up towards closing time, but they never do. Wendy says that maybe they did find something that they made a bunch of arrests. Of course if that was the case, it seems like Keller might’ve sent someone back to at least tell you. You’re hoping they just didn’t pocket the money, but Wendy assures you that Keller wouldn’t have done that.\n\n\n\nThe next day after you get back from class and ready for another grueling day at the inn, you ask Wendy what’s the status on the Flying Griffon and Keller. She says she doesn’t know and that she hasn’t seen him.\n\n\n\n“What?! Are you kidding me? I know you two got something going on and you’re saying you haven’t seen him?”\n\n“Yeah that’s what I said! We’re not fucking married alright? He’s a damn militia man, he might’ve gotten assigned to the Cloudspeak Mountains and his head smashed in by a troll for all I know!”\n\n“Who got their head smashed in by troll?” a familiar voice asks.\n\n\n\nWendy and you turn to look and see Sergeant Keller with his men.\n\n\n\n“Where have you been?! I was worried!” Wendy exclaims, running to him.\n\n“Just on business, m’love. No need to worry, I’m here now.”\n\n“And that still doesn’t answer the question, where have you been? I paid a lot of money, I would’ve appreciated someone telling what exactly happened at the Flying Griffon last night.” You demand causing Sergeant Keller’s eyes to narrow.\n\n\n\n“Nothing happened. And I don’t know what you’re talking about. In fact I’ve gotten some reports about this place and I’m afraid I need to search it. Please cooperate and things will go smoother.” Keller says as his men start spreading out to search the place.\n\n\n\n“What the fuck Keller?! Did Frank pay you more money or something?! You fucking sonofabitch!” you shout.\n\n“I said mind your tone kid, or I’ll arrest you for interference with an investigation.”\n\n\n\nYour mom soon comes out of the kitchen and your remaining guests start wondering what’s going on as they’re being pushed out of their rooms.\n\n\n\n“Son, what’s going on, there’s militia looking all through the kitchen and the cellar!”\n\n“Apparently Keller’s a double crossing bastard that’s what…”\n\n“Now hold on! I’m sure he’s got a perfectly good explanation for all this!” Wendy says trying to defend him.\n\n“Hey Sergeant! We got something here!”\n\n\n\nAt this point one his men comes out with a container that contains several Cloudspeak Rock.\n\n\n\n“NO! NO! NO FUCKING WAY! You planted that shit there!” you protest.\n\n“That wasn’t in there!” your Mom adds\n\n“Oh my!” Eliza says.\n\n\n\nKeller looks at the container and shakes his head.\n\n\n\n“(Sigh) Y’know I’ve been coming here for awhile now, and I can’t believe that this going on the whole time…”\n\n“Now wait a minute! You can’t honestly believe that we were all selling illegal drugs!” Wendy says.\n\n“No, I don’t believe you were. But I do believe they were.”\n\n\n\nSuddenly four of Keller’s men apprehend you and your mother. There’s a lot of protesting and fighting, but of course this only makes things worse. You end up getting a mace to your head and when you wake up you’re in a jail cell with almost all of your staff.\n\n\n\n“What…what’s going on?” you say rubbing your head and sitting up from the cell floor.\n\n“Keller’s gone fucking crazy that’s what and that bitch Wendy is backing him up to save her own ass! I told you we should’ve just went with my plan!” Rita yells.\n\n“What the hell are you doing in here? Last thing I remember they took me and mom in for those drugs they claimed we were selling.”\n\n“Well they decided to trump up the charges of illegal prostitution as well, so they took in me and those two half elven sluts over there. Yeah right like if I was a prostitute, they’d even be in the same league as me!”\n\n“Oh fuck you Rita.” Sunshine says, while Flameflower gives Rita the finger.\n\n“Even Eliza?” you say in disbelief at all this.\n\n“Um, no. I’m here for assault. I knocked out one of Keller’s men when they were taking you and your mother away. I didn’t mean to, I just got so angry at this great injustice.” Eliza says.\n\n“Heh, thanks I guess.”\n\n\n\nYou get off the floor and go sit over with your mother who’s been silent the whole time.\n\n\n\nShe doesn’t have too much to say except that assuming that she doesn’t go to prison, she’s getting the hell out of Klyton. She apologizes to you that you won’t get to achieve your goal, but at this point you’re just worried about not going to prison too.\n\n\n\nEventually all of you are released after a couple days. Rita, Flameflower and Sunshine are all given a warning. Eliza somehow manages to avoid real prosecution for assaulting a guard, but for whatever reason she doesn’t get any further punishment.\n\n\n\nYou and your mother aren’t quite as lucky. You don’t have to serve any time fortunately, but the inn is taken away from you and given to the city of Klyton as reparations for your “crimes” against it.\n\n\n\nWell that’s it then. An end to you future in Klyton. You and your mother have little choice but to move to Teckleville now. And that’s where you go.\n\n\n\nYour aunt Enora is happy to see you both, and while this whole living with her thing was sprung on her at the last moment it doesn’t seem to bother her. She says there’s plenty of room and you can stay as long as you like.\n\n\n\nWhile the house is certainly nice and you’re happy to live there rather than in the street, it’s sort of on the small side and you feel like you have no privacy. Teckleville isn’t anything like you’re used to either. The whole small town thing just doesn’t appeal to you, and you feel trapped with a bunch of boring backwards people.\n\n\n\nYou were supposed to do greater things! You were going to be a doctor! You did everything right and studied hard and what do you have to show for it? Nothing! You’re stuck in some cow town where the best job you can hope to get is probably shoveling shit. Some future.\n\n\n\nIn time, your mother works at the local tavern where she serves as a cook. It’s not much, but it is something she’s used to doing.\n\n\n\nYou manage to get a job working as an assistant to the mean old bastard who runs the general store. It’s a thankless job, but he’s about the only one who’ll hire you since nobody else will work for him and everyone else thinks you have a superiority complex (Which is sort of true) and won’t hire you.\n\n\n\nThe only upside is since you live at your aunt’s house you manage to save what little money you do make and eventually get a place of your own. You always think about moving to the Delantium Kingdom and start fresh again, but you never do.\n\n\n\nYou basically remain in Teckleville where you eventually take over running the general store when the mean old bastard dies, where upon you become the new mean old bastard who runs the general store until you die as well.\n\n\n\nYou often think back about what went wrong at the inn and what might’ve happened if you’d done things differently, but you’ll never know.\n",
  "page 37": "You can’t stand running this increasingly run down piss hole anymore; you’re selling the place. You figure you should be able to get enough money to finish your schooling.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately “piss hole” is too correct of a word for what it goes for. Sure it’s a business, and it’s in adequate shape, but the city generally doesn’t give out that much money for “adequate”.\n\n\n\nYou get just enough money to probably cover a couple semesters, not nearly enough. That’s when you get the idea to improvise.\n\n\n\nLearning the lesson in cutting corners at the inn, you enroll back at Klyton University and set up a small lab like you did with the still but this time you decide to make drugs instead. Cloud rock is easy to make and you figure you’ll be able to support yourself and if you get a part time job on campus, you should be able to swing it. The inn money will help you in the beginning months while you get settled.\n\n\n\nThings initially go good for you, just like you thought, but when the inn money runs out that’s when crunch time starts and you’re not quite as prepared for it as you thought.\n\n\n\nClasses get increasingly harder, which means you need to study a lot more, combining that with your two jobs is rough and eventually you’re not getting enough rest and one of them has to go. Not surprisingly you quit your regular job as the university’s bookstore assistant since it pays less and you figure you can easily make up the money just by selling more drugs which you’ve become frighteningly good at.\n\n\n\nAfter one more semester, you figure why bother with college at all? You could just sell Cloud Rock all day make as much money as a low level physician might and not bother with studying, because really what has this college business gotten you? A lot of wasted time that’s what.\n\n\n\nSo that’s what you do.\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t need to be said that such a path rarely leads to a good end, but you do have your fun while it lasts which is probably a little longer than you thought it might be.\n\n\n\nAs you lay dying because you pissed off some other criminal for whatever wrong or perceived wrong you might’ve done to him, you think back to where it all went wrong and all you can think about is:\n\n\n\n“That damn inn.”\n",
  "page 36": "You’re willing to stick it out a little longer, but you really need to use a few short cuts now. The brew from the still is good enough for the miners and you won’t have to deal with a middleman anymore.\n\n\n\nYour mother isn’t happy with this idea. She wasn’t thrilled with it before, but realized it was necessary at the time. You argue with her for hours about the moral and legal ramifications of it all until she finally gets tired and capitulates under stress.\n\n\n\nOver the months you manage to save tons of money, are able to pay Mr. Reynolds off larger amounts and you believe in a few more months you’ll completely be free of him.\n\n\n\nThe problem now is with your mother who still insists on bitching at you day in day out despite the fact that you’re basically saving her ass from the problems that her and your dumb ass dad got you involved into in the first place.\n\n\n\n“For fuck’s sake, will get off my fucking back? I’ve been the main one coming up with solutions on how to save this fucking place and I’m getting shit for it? Why the hell am I getting punished for something you and dad did? I was supposed to be taking classes right now to become a doctor! Y’know, like YOU all wanted me to? I’m trying to make the best of this situation and still find a damn way of achieving my goals yet all I’m getting is kicked in the fucking face for it!” you yell while throwing a potato against the wall.\n\n\n\nYour mother shakes her head.\n\n\n\n“I don’t know what’s happened to you, but the son I knew wouldn’t be engaging in criminal activities and yelling at me like this. This isn’t worth it; I’m not dealing with this anymore. You want to be mad at me and your father, you can go right ahead, you might even be right in some way but I’m still not going to put up with it. You think you can turn this place around and still achieve your goals? Go right ahead, but you’re doing it without my help. I quit, and I’m handing this place over to you. Have fun, and I hope you make all your dreams come true.”\n\n\n\nYou’re a little shocked by this. You run after her asking what she’s going to do and that you’re sorry about the stuff you said, but she won’t hear it. She just says she’s leaving the deed with you and she’s going to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville.\n\n\n\nAfter some last words are exchanged she’s gone. You aren’t quite sure how to feel and you’re still trying to wrap your head around it when your barmaids come in.\n\n\n\n“Hey which one of you is the best cook?”\n\n“Uh, I guess that would be me.” Wendy says.\n\n“Good, you’re upgrade to cook, you’ll get a small raise too.”\n\n“What seriously?”\n\n“Yeah, mom quit and gave me this place, so we’re making some changes around here.”\n\n\n\nWendy looks a little pleased with getting a small promotion, but Rita isn’t so happy.\n\n\n\n“Hey what about us? You can’t just expect us to shoulder all the extra work! You’re going to have to hire someone else to help!” Rita says\n\n“Settle down Rita, I’ll be getting some new help soon don’t worry about it. All I need from the rest of you is to do your jobs.”\n\n\n\nA few weeks pass and you’re doing okay even if you’re getting some grumbles from your staff every once in awhile. You do end up hiring a new person, but it’s not another barmaid. It’s a janitor so the barmaids don’t need to worry about cleaning up as much anymore. The great thing is he’s simple minded and you don’t need to pay him since apparently his mother wanted him out of the house and dragged him by the ear to you when she saw your Help Wanted sign. You agreed to let him sleep in your cellar and he could eat all the rats he catches down there. (Though Eliza gives him real food from time to time)\n\n\n\nYour still is perfected a bit better, but the brew from that stuff does take it’s toll on your usual patrons. While none of the miners go blind, a lot of them are starting to feel several side effects from drinking the stuff on a regular basis. This causes some to stop coming in altogether, but on the “plus side” you do get a few more lowly types that don’t give a shit what poison they put into their system. You end up changing the name of the place to the Bottomless Mug Inn.\n\n\n\nDespite your decrease in clientele you still manage to cut enough corners and exploit enough drunks that you pay off Mr. Reynolds. He’s a little surprised considering how run down the inn has gotten. He suspects (quite rightly) that you’re probably doing something illegal and tells you if you ever need another loan in the future you know where to find him. You vow that you’re not going to let that happen.\n\n\n\nWell the inn is profitable again (barely) and you’ve effectively saved the place and your mother from potential danger (mainly yourself) but taking over your father’s inn wasn’t your dream and it wasn’t your parents’ dream either.\n\n\n\nYou figure you’ve got two choices, you could either sell this place now and hope you get enough money for it to finish your education, or you could continue to run it as a ongoing source of income and somehow manage to save enough as well as find the time to study while running this dump.\n",

You’ve also managed to re-establish some old contacts with people you were “friends” with before your “break”. Most of them are ahead of you and some are getting ready to graduate. While none of them bothered to stay in contact with you (so much for education breaking down class distinctions) a few of them are still willing to help you out by selling you books for cheap or giving you some of their old notes. Every little bit helps.\n\n\n\nAs for the inn, it’s doing well, but you constantly worry about its future profitability. Your regular patrons aren’t the upstanding working class anymore, most of them are petty criminals, broke losers and other ne’er-do-wells. You also have to do something about your overworked/underpaid staff. So far Wendy has been doing far more than she anticipated and is demanding more pay. Rita on the other hand is just plain threatening to quit. All of which is cutting into your study and school time.\n\n\n\nA few bright spots are you’re getting adventurers coming in since those nice rooms you got awhile back started to pay off. You’re also saving money with your stills (You have multiple ones in the basement now) and your retarded janitor Alan who seems to be just happy to work and follow your orders. If only all your employees were so agreeable.\n\n\n\nToday’s the day you make a change to the status quo.\n",
  "page 38": "You know it isn’t going to be easy, but selling the inn would be folly. You’re not going to get as much for the inn anymore and you know that you’ll need a steady source of income and this place also serves as your home. You’ve already managed to cut a few corners to save money, so perhaps you’ll be able to figure out how to cut some more to achieve your goal.\n\n\n\nOne idea has crossed your mind already, but you’d rather see if any other opportunities arise before resorting to it. The inn is a little shadier now, and that’s partly because of you. Still, you aren’t really a bad person, you’ve just been put in a rough situation and you’re trying to make the best of it. You figure the ends will justify the means after all is said and done.\n\n\n\nYou hope.\n",
  "page 71": " \n\nSometimes you have to take risks to get ahead.\n\n\n\n“Alright fine, if that’s the way this is going, then we don’t have much of a choice. Rita, you’re the Miner’s Mug hostess.” You say.\n\n“WHAT!?\n\n“As it should be.”\n\n“Fuck this, I’m not working myself to death while she gets a raise to just stand around.” Wendy says.\n\n“That’s good because you’ll be getting a raise as well since I’m promoting you to head barmaid and we’re hiring a new one. Now that should make you feel a little bit better now shouldn’t it?”\n\n\n\nBefore Wendy can reply, your mother speaks up.\n\n\n\n“What are you doing? We can’t afford all this or have you forgotten that we still have to pay off Mr. Reynolds?”\n\n“And we are, and we will. But this place has finally gotten the kind of business it should be getting and we need to broaden our base. We’re getting more than just miners and low ranking adventurers; we’re starting to get a slightly higher class of patrons. I think these changes will be good in the long run, so are we all in agreement?”\n\n\n\nEveryone seems to nod and be fine with their new job titles/promotions and the idea of making the inn into a better moneymaker. Just then Eliza speaks up after being quiet the whole time.\n\n\n\n“I have a suggestion. If we’re branching out past our usual miner customers shouldn’t we change the name of the inn to something slightly more inclusive?”\n\n\n\nEliza has a point, after thinking about it, you come up with “The Traveler’s Inn” which seems to be as good as name as any to signify people other than miners come here. The changes are made…\n\n\n\nMonths pass and everything goes as well as expected. Everyone is a little busier, but the inn is finally making a lot more profit and you were right, eventually you get out of Mr. Reynolds’ debt. You half expect him to try to pull a fast one to get more money out of you, but with the increase in Klyton Militia hanging around, he doesn’t and just says if you ever need another loan in the future you know where to find him. You’re definitely not going to let that happen.\n\n\n\nYou also re-establish your alcohol supplier with Klyton again. You’re making enough money to afford it and you won’t have to deal with Calwin anymore.\n\n\n\nThe inn is profitable again and you’ve effectively saved the place and your mother from potential danger (as well as yourself) but taking over your father’s inn wasn’t your dream and it wasn’t your parents’ dreams either. They pushed you to make something better of yourself and it stuck.\n\n\n\nYou’re not going to give up now, you have to find out a way of raising enough money to put yourself through school again AND finding the time to study while running the inn. You try to think about how you’re going to accomplish this, and you know you\u0027ve got quite the challenge ahead of you.\n",
  "page 72": "Rita’s bluffing. Despite her high opinion of herself, she still needs this job.\n\n\n\n“Rita, you’re out of line. EVERYONE busts their ass around here and I’m not going to show you some sort of favoritism just because your looks are bringing in more people!”\n\n\n\nRita bickers with the rest of you for a while and after threatening to quit several times during the argument she finally agrees to stay, but you still have to give her a small raise. Nothing pocket breaking, but enough to shut her up and keep Wendy from rebelling in the process.\n\n\n\nThe next few weeks go as well as can be expected, though Rita’s constant complaining is an ongoing problem. Eventually you learn to tune her out, but one day she’s “tuned out” permanently.\n\n\n\nWhile Rita was still more or less doing her job of bringing in more people, her attitude got a lot worse. This sometimes resulted in her driving away people as opposed to enticing them. This still wouldn’t be so bad considering how many losers are willing to put up with abuse from pretty girls.\n\n\n\nThe problem was when she eventually pissed off the wrong person and this deranged individual decided to “teach the whore a lesson” and waited for her after work. The gruesome details involved rape, the removal of several of her vital parts and death (Not necessarily in that order).\n\n\n\nYou can’t say you exactly liked Rita’s personality, but she didn’t deserve that. You even feel partially responsible for putting her in that position in the first place. Your mother tries to assure you that it wasn’t your fault, but it still doesn’t make you feel any better.\n\n\n\nYou feel even worse when the inn begins to feel the loss. While several regular customers offer their condolences many of the others brought in by Rita in the first place stop coming. You also don’t have Rita to help bring in any new people either. Eliza also quits because she’s so shook up about Rita’s death that she feels it isn’t safe to work at the inn anymore.\n\n\n\nYou manage to pay off Mr. Reynolds, but it’s just barely again and you’re not optimistic about future payments since he’s hinted that he’s going to need larger payments in the future. It would seem he realizes that you’ve almost paid him off and he wants to keep the money flow a little longer. You’re so disheartened by this, Rita’s death and the other headaches that you’ve had to put up with that you decide maybe it’s time to just give up.\n\n\n\nYou fought the good fight for as long as you could, but maybe it just wasn’t meant to be. You’re not going to finish this one, which is a familiar theme to you since you dropped out of college. You tell your mother what you think and she seems just as eager to sell the place off too since the past few months have been pretty stressful.\n\n\n\nDuring the remaining week the inn stays open to make a last bit of change before closing for good and selling to the city. Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn’t like how it used to be anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren’t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother finds work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can’t really stand living in the city without your father anymore. She leaves to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville, which is to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAfter a long time of the inn just sitting untended and forgotten due to the council having more pressing matters and red tape, it’s broken into by several homeless people who use it as a place to sleep. The homeless are soon ousted by a local gang who use it as a safe house. Eventually though they cause enough trouble that the Klyton Militia has to take severe action and storm the place, resulting in a small fire.\n\n\n\nAt this point someone in the council finally notices it, decides that the place isn’t worth salvaging and proposes that it be knocked down to build a medical clinic in its place to try to uplift the area. The motion passes.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you find a job thanks to your education level, but it isn’t anywhere in the field that you would’ve liked. You’re a clerk in tax office, filing away items, straightening out reports and such. You never really move up and you never make enough money to save away to get ahead either.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have a bad life so much as a mind numbingly mundane one. You do have your good days, but ultimately you never really achieve your goals and always have a sense of dissatisfaction with your life.\n\n\n\nSometimes you look back and wonder where you exactly went wrong with the inn and how you could’ve done things differently.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 31": " \n\nYou agree with your mother, you don’t want to take another beating and that was only a punch in the stomach from an ogre. Who knows what they’ll do to you next?\n\n\n\nYou and your mother pack as quickly as you can and catch a late coach heading west. It feels weird leaving Klyton, in fact now that you think about it, you’ve never been out of city before.\n\n\n\nEventually after a couple days the coach stops in Teckleville where your aunt lives. Teckleville is just one of the many small villages on the borders of the Dalantium Kingdom. Probably in time it’ll get absorbed like so many others do, but that’s not really a concern of yours right now.\n\n\n\nYour aunt Enora is happy to see you both, and while this whole living with her thing was sprung on her at the last moment it doesn’t seem to bother her. She says there’s plenty of room and you can stay as long as you like.\n\n\n\nWhile the house is certainly nice and you’re happy to live there rather than in the street, it’s sort of on the small side and you feel like you have no privacy. Teckleville isn’t anything like you’re used to either. The whole small town thing just doesn’t appeal to you, and you feel trapped with a bunch of boring backwards people. It’s even worse than when you were stuck serving the miners.\n\n\n\nYou were supposed to do greater things! Your were going to be a doctor! You did everything right and studied hard and what do you have to show for it? Nothing! You’re stuck in some cow town where the best job you can hope to get is probably shoveling shit. Some future.\n\n\n\n“Thanks dad, you fucking idiot.” You say throwing a rock against a barn door.\n\n\n\nIn time, your mother works at the local tavern where she serves as a cook. It’s not much, but it is something she’s used to doing.\n\n\n\nYou manage to get a job working as an assistant to the mean old bastard who runs the general store. It’s a thankless job, but he’s about the only one who’ll hire you since nobody else will work for him and everyone else thinks you have a superiority complex (Which is sort of true) and won’t hire you.\n\n\n\nThe only upside is since you live at your aunt’s house you manage to save what little money you do make. You have a plan to head to the Delantium Kingdom and start fresh again, because staying here isn’t in your future.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately neither is the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nOne night while you’re sleeping an oversized hand covers your mouth and two more grab your arms. You open your eyes to see Olaf grinning at you in the darkness.\n\n\n\n“What? Did you really think we’d forget about you? Don’t worry about the debt anymore kid, consider it paid with your family’s life.” You hear Mr. Reynolds whisper before he shoves a knife into your stomach and rips it up to your chest.\n\n\n\nThe next day your aunt’s friend finds the bloody bodies of you, your mother and your aunt. The incident becomes known as the Teckleville Massacre.\n",
  "page 75": "While all the rest of the ideas seem okay, you really think you need to act quickly on this. It’ll be ugly and ruthless, but unfortunately necessary. Since everyone is against Rita’s idea though, you decide not to say anything about it and say you’re going to have to think everything over later.\n\n\n\nWhen everyone’s away you decide to talk to Rita privately.\n\n\n\n“Rita, can I speak to you for a moment?”\n\n“I knew this was coming eventually…look you’re alright looking and if you do manage to become a doctor then maybe I’ll be interested, but until then…”\n\n“What? No! I wanted to speak to you about your plan.”\n\n“Oh.” Rita says looking a little disappointed that you weren’t suggesting what she thought you were.\n\n“Anyway, who did you have in mind to do this deed?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know really. I figured you might know, I mean didn’t you have Crimson Talon connections or something?”\n\n“Connections? Those were thugs that were going to break my legs if I didn’t pay a loanshark on time. I don’t have any connections. I mean with all the guys you go out with…”\n\n“Hey! I don’t like what you’re implying! Contrary to popular belief I’m not some whore like those two half breed sluts you saw fit to hire recently. I’m a lot more selective and I’m certainly not going out with criminal types!”\n\n“Hmmm, if you say so.”\n\n“Why don’t you just go back to that Reynolds guy? I mean he’s sort of a connection right?”\n\n“You must be joking!”\n\n“Not at all, I mean surely for a fee he could lend you that ogre for a little while right?”\n\n“I dunno if it works that way…(Sigh) alright I suppose I could try since I don’t have any other contacts.”\n\n“Okay. Oh! Here take this.” Rita says handing you a small notebook.\n\n“What’s this?”\n\n“It’s the name of every whore that works for the Flying Griffon and their physical description. I have where some of them live too, but not all of them.”\n\n\n\nYou stare at Rita in disbelief\n\n\n\n“What? Eliza’s not the only one who can think up spying you know.” Rita remarks.\n\n“Yeah, but Eliza’s not the one who was stalking the competition out of jealousy either. Nevermind, I guess this will help since I never kept up on who worked there anyway.”\n\n\n\nThe next day after class, you don’t go to the inn, but instead head to where you know Mr. Reynold’s “office” is. It’s not in a good part of the city, but you make it without any problems.\n\n\n\nMr. Reynold’s is currently alone and smiles when he sees you.\n\n\n\n“Somehow I just knew we’d meet each other again soon, so how much you need this time?”\n\n“I don’t need money, I need something else and you’re about the only person I can think of who might be able to help.”\n\n“Oh? Well this is interesting. What is it?”\n\n“I need that ogre that works for you or whoever that other big guy was.”\n\n“Olaf and Silence? They’re not freelancing for me anymore sadly. The Crimson Talons have them doing something more directly important for them. I believe they fight at one of those underground gladiator matches now.”\n\n“Well, can I get in contact with them some how?”\n\n“Ha ha ha! Well I suppose I could tell you, but I don’t think they’d necessarily let you in, I guess you’d have to speak to whoever’s in charge and well it would be a big hassle really…what did you need them for anyway?”\n\n“Is it any of your business?”\n\n“Well if Olaf and Silence had still been freelancing for me it would’ve been, but I guess not now. I’m assuming you need some sort of muscle though, and if that is the case I DO have two new employees that might work out for you. David! Tom! Get in here, we might have some business!”\n\n\n\n“Yeah, boss what’s up…hey! I know you!” David says looking at you.\n\n“Hey! How’s it been? Didn’t you go to college?” Tom adds.\n\n\n\nNow here’s a blast from the past, your two old school buddies all grown up and obviously full blown criminals now. Funny to think back how your life turned out so different…then again maybe not considering you’re here to have several women horribly disfigured.\n\n\n\n“Well, it seems you gentlemen all know each other, maybe now you’re ready to tell us what you need doing?”\n\n\n\nYou take a deep breath and state what you need done.\n\n\n\n“Wow, didn’t expect that one.” Mr. Reynolds says. David and Tom are also surprised.\n\n“Shit, what the hell did they do to you, cheat on you?” David asks.\n\n“Fuck man, that’s some serial killer shit!” Tom adds.\n\n“Look, I don’t need them killed! I just need them disfigured so they aren’t pretty anymore.”\n\n“Yeah, I got that. Okay, so how much you willing to pay?” Mr. Reynolds asks.\n\n\n\nYou and Mr. Reynolds negotiate a price, which is agreeable, but Tom begins to speak up.\n\n\n\n“Uh…I dunno Mr. Reynolds. I don’t think I can do this…”\n\n“Tom, stop being a pussy! We’re just gonna cut up some bitches and get out, shit ain’t that hard.” David says\n\n“But I dunno. I just feel weird about doing this. It’s not like beating up people who don’t pay on time.”\n\n“You’ll do what I tell you to do! David, you better keep your little sidekick in line before I replace the pair of you!” Mr. Reynolds snaps.\n\n\n\nYou think back to your old childhood involving your former friends. Tom always was the weakest of you three, but he always went along despite protests. You have no doubt David’s capable of committing the act, you just wonder if he’s gotten any brighter since then. The last thing you need is for them to fuck this up for you and get all of you in trouble.\n\n\n\nGetting the “real professionals” might be tough though. Might even cost more money.\n",
  "page 30": "You figure you’ll be able to stretch out your alcohol supply just long enough to get your next shipment and you’ll just have to hope for the best.\n\n\n\nThat very night you’re already getting comments that the ale doesn’t taste quite as strong, this results in the miners ordering MORE ale since they aren’t getting drunk on what you’re currently giving them. This means you end up having less alcohol to stretch things out.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the week, you’re getting loud verbal complaints about the ale, and outright accusations that it tastes like water. Several miners are insulted and leave the inn claiming that they’ve been loyal patrons here for so long and that they don’t need to be treated like this. You attempt to explain, but they shove you out of the way and tell you to go back to your fancy college.\n\n\n\n“I wish I could.” You quietly say to yourself.\n\n\n\nYou aren’t optimistic about the rest of the month. Sure there’s still adventurers and the odd wanderer, but not enough to turn a profit before you get in the next shipment. This still wouldn’t be so bad except it’s going to be time to pay Mr. Reynolds soon and you’re going to fall short again.\n\n\n\nYour mother can’t bare to see you get hurt again and suggests forgetting all about the inn and just taking off with all the remaining money you have and going to live with your crazy aunt Enora.\n",

Every little bit helps.\n\n\n\nAs for the inn, it’s doing well, but you constantly worry about its future profitability. You’ve got a much broader customer base and even classed the place up a bit, but this isn’t without its drawbacks. Namely the Flying Griffon Inn has stepped up its efforts to get back its customers. This has so far involved an aggressive advertising campaign, hiring a bunch of sexy barmaids and special deals. So far it has helped them a lot and if they continue to succeed, your inn is going to start losing money and you can’t have that. It doesn’t help that your place isn’t in as good of a location as the Flying Griffon\n\n\n\nSo first things first, you need to figure out how to deal with Flying Griffon and you call a staff meeting in the hopes of getting some other ideas on how to deal with them.\n\n\n\n“Why don’t you just hire someone to cut up their slutty barmaids? I mean that’s what’s mainly getting the main draw right? Seems like you could easily solve the problem by getting rid of them.” Rita says. Naturally this doesn’t go over well with the others.\n\n“That’s horrible!” Eliza says\n\n“ What? I didn’t say kill them, they’d still be able to work and shit. They just wouldn’t be pretty anymore.”\n\n“Have you gotten so jealous that you’ve gone completely barmy? By the gods, we’re not doing that, we’re not the Crimson Talons!” Wendy shouts.\n\n\n\nAs much as disfiguring Flying Griffon’s staff would solve some problems, you hesitate to resort to such measures.\n\n\n\n“Maybe we could offer deals to traveling merchants like Flying Griffon does, like they get a discount on their rooms?” your mom suggests.\n\n“Not sure if that’s going to help us a lot, unless we make an addition to the inn. It’s not like our rooms aren’t being used. If we start giving discount to merchants we might attract them, but we might not have enough rooms to accommodate them or we’ll be accommodating them, but won’t be accommodating adventurer types who are paying full price.” Wendy says.\n\n\n\n“Well if you’re so knowledgeable Wendy, what’s YOUR solution?” Rita sneers.\n\n“We have a lot of Klyton Milita that come here to drink now don’t we? Why don’t we get some of them to help us? Seems like some very public investigation during heavy business hours would help out a lot and ruin the reputation of Flying Griffon. Hell, maybe they’ll even find something and we’ll really get lucky.”\n\n\n\nYou take all these suggestions into consideration, but you can’t help notice that Eliza looks like she wants to say something.\n\n\n\n“Eliza, do you have a suggestion?”\n\n“Huh? Oh. Um…yes…but I... Just forget it. It’s silly anyway. The rest of your ideas sound better.”\n\n“Eliza, just spit it out!” Wendy demands.\n\n“It’s okay, just tell us.” You say with a lot less intimidation.\n\n“Well okay, but it’s silly. I was going to suggest getting someone on the inside to spy on the place and finding something to use against them. It seems odd that they are managing to attract that much attention with just pretty barmaids when we have our own. I think maybe something else is going on there, like an illegal brothel or something.”\n\n\n\nMost of you are surprised that Eliza came up with something so complex.\n\n\n\n“Well, that’s a very elaborate plan Eliza, but I think we could accomplish the same thing just by sending in our militia buddies to harass them. Like I said, if they do find anything actually incriminating, then its even better.”\n\n“Yes, of course. That sounds like a more efficient idea.” Eliza says.\n",
  "page 112": "A few years have passed and your medical schooling is complete and you now work at the Klyton hospital as a real doctor.\n\n\n\nYour personal life has changed quite a bit over the past few years as well. You currently live in an apartment near the hospital with a fellow medical student. Actually she’s your girlfriend. It started out as a simple roommates thing, but then it developed into something a little more. Cindy still has a year of schooling to go, and you now have a job at the hospital so you weren’t planning on going anywhere just yet.\n\n\n\nHowever Cindy suggests that the pair of you should leave for the Delantium Kingdom, specifically Sivak, which is the closest big city. She mentions that there are more opportunities there and she would prefer living there as well.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have any specific objections against going there, it’s just you’ve never left Klyton, so you’re probably a little nervous especially since you’ve managed to succeed in getting a good job here and maintain a friendly relationship with most of the people you work beside.\n\n\n\nWell you have a year to hammer out all the plans in the meantime you’re on your way to visit your mother. You don’t see her as much as you used to but she is of course very proud of you and mentions that your father would be too if he were still alive. After all it was always his goal to make sure that you went into medicine for a career.\n\n\n\nWhen you get to the Traveler’s Inn, it never ceases to amaze you how much the place has changed and how much it has grown since the days when you were little. Wendy does most of the day to day inn management nowadays, leaving your mom to concentrate on the cooking, which she prefers in the first place. Rita still works there surprisingly enough. Apparently she found it a lot better to just hook up with various rich guys for a short period of time to get some gifts and then remain single.\n\n\n\nEliza is the new head barmaid. You guess that experience with the whole Griffon Inn situation boosted her confidence. She even managed to turn Flameflower and Sunshine into productive employees! You remember how friendly you were to each other and how sometimes it seemed like there was the potential for more there, but neither one of you seriously pursued it.\n\n\n\n“Well, haven’t seen you in awhile Mr. big shot doctor. You still with that…girl?” Rita asks when you walk in.\n\n“Her name’s Cindy and yes I am, Rita. What’s it to you anyway?”\n\n“Nothing, can’t I be concerned for your well being? I mean we have known each other for a long time and all.”\n\n“Hm. Well I’m fine. Where’s my mom?”\n\n“She’s in the kitchen as usual.”\n\n\n\nYou walk past Rita, shaking your head at her sudden interest in you now that you have a good paying job. As you approach the bar, Wendy notices you.\n\n\n\n“I see the great doctor has come for a visit. Taking a break from that girl you shacked up with huh? Anyway your mom is in the kitchen.” She says and then goes back to talking with some of the patrons.\n\n\n\nWhen you enter the kitchen your mom turns around to see you and smiles before rushing to give you a big hug.\n\n\n\n“Aw mom.” You say not wanting all this fuss.\n\n“Hey indulge me, I don’t get to see you as much as I used to. So how have you been? What’s going on? Are you still with…that girl?”\n\n“Her name’s Cindy, geez why doesn’t anyone like her? Rita and Wendy both made some snide remark about her as I came walking in.”\n\n“Sorry son, I’m sure Cindy’s a nice girl and all, but the couple times you visited here with her, she was a bit pretentious, and you know Wendy doesn’t care for people like that. As for Rita, well I’m sure you know why she’s acts the way she does by now.”\n\n“ Okay I know Cindy has a bit of that upper class personality, but Eliza was the only one who even tried to be friendly with Cindy the last time she was here!”\n\n“Eliza would be friendly to a mountain troll as long as it wasn’t eating her. It’s just her nature. Not to mention she thinks you’re happy with Cindy so she’s happy for you.”\n\n“So, why can’t you be happy for me?”\n\n“Who said I wasn’t? If that’s who you want then good! I’m all for it. The question though is are you happy?”\n\n“Of course I am! I wouldn’t be moving with her to Sivak by next year if I wasn’t! That’s sort of why I came here today. I wanted to let you know, I’ll be leaving Klyton soon.”\n\n\n\nYou mother doesn’t seem too emotional about this revelation, you were sort of expecting more tears or celebration. Instead she just sighs and heads off to cut some vegetables, before speaking again.\n\n\n\n“Hmm, okay. Well as long as you’re sure that’s what you want to do.”\n\n“Why wouldn’t it? I mean there are more opportunities in Sivak than there are here for me and Cindy. You didn’t want me to stay did you? I thought you were going to sell this place and move to Teckleville anyway.”\n\n“No, of course I don’t want you to stay for me! Geez, I can manage just fine. Your father and I always knew the day would come that you’d move far away. As for selling this place, eh, I’m not sure yet. It is true that after your father died, my main motivation was to keep this place running to help continue paying for your education. I figured after that goal was reached I would indeed retire to Teckleville. I dunno now though. I guess after all the stuff we went through to keep this place, not to mention making it better, I’ve become more attached to it again.”\n\n\n\nNow you’re sort of surprised to hear her say that, you thought for sure that she was fully intending on moving back to Teckleville.\n\n\n\n“Well, no matter where you are, I hope you know I’ll visit.” You say.\n\n“Oh of course, I wasn’t worried about that. Well anyway I have to finish preparing this drakling. Some adventurers can’t ever order something simple, well at least they brought it in themselves I suppose.”\n\n\n\nAt this point you and your mother say goodbye to each other and you walk out of the kitchen. On your way out you bump into Eliza.\n\n\n\n“Hey you! I haven’t seen you in a long time! How have you been? Are things going well for you and Cindy?”\n\nYou smile at the fact that she remembered your girlfriend’s name. “I’ve been okay. I heard about you being the head waitress now, congratulation.”\n\n“Thanks, I’m actually running a little late right now. I’ll have to talk with you later, maybe we should meet sometime when we’re not both busy.”\n\n“Um…yeah maybe. Well see you later.” You say and quickly leave the area.\n\n\n\nAs you leave you feel a mixture of guilt, anxiety and confusion. Part of you wants to go back. You don’t know if you have real feelings for Eliza or you’re just deliberately thinking about sabotaging things so you don’t have to move away from Klyton.\n",
  "page 111": "Cindy: Girlfriend\n\n\n\nYou met Cindy about a year and a half ago. How you missed each before all this time is mostly due to her focus in pediatrics. It’s a relatively new field. Before it was seriously considered as a real branch of medicine; kids were treated like miniature adults, which sometimes lead to unfortunate “over medication.”\n\n\n\nLike most people who pursue the medical field she comes from a wealthy merchant family, though originally her family came from the Delantium Kingdom and moved here a long time ago mainly because her father didn’t like all the new taxes imposed by the Kingdom. She still has extended family there and remains on good terms with them and hopes to move back some day since she’s never cared much for Klyton, claiming that most of the city doesn’t have the appreciation of the fine arts and is rather “low class” in general. (Even the rich Klytonians)\n\n\n\nThis sort of attitude is mostly due to her Delantium upbringing when she was young, but despite this she still wants to help the children of the less fortunate since she feels everyone still should get the chance to pull themselves out of the gutter. This is probably why she found you attractive. While you certainly had help, you did manage to pull yourself “out of the gutter” so to speak. Of course the few times that she visited the inn, she didn’t make a good impression with most of your acquaintances there. She wasn’t outright rude, but she was standoffish to a point where most of them considered her a snob (and a few others worse than that!)\n\n\n\nYou take it in stride for the most part. As long as she’s not calling your mother a gutter whore, you’re not excessively bothered by her slightly elitist ways.\n",
  "page 113": "Given that Eliza didn’t seem to happy with you, your future with her seems unlikely. You see now that you missed that opportunity a long time ago and that you need to move on from this folly. You just hope that you’ll be able to and that none of this will get back to Cindy.\n\n\n\nWhen you get home, Cindy asks where you’ve been and you tell her you visited your mother at the inn. You don’t really elaborate anymore than that, but Cindy doesn’t ask anything further as she’s not too interested in what’s ever going on there in the first place.\n\n\n\nDuring your last remaining year in Klyton, you don’t visit your family’s inn anymore as a safety precaution. You try to go on about your life though the fear of Cindy finding out what might’ve happened is always in the back of your mind. Granted Cindy’s not likely to visit the inn anytime soon, but what happens if one of those miners goes to the hospital for a broken leg or something? What if he sees you and asks how Eliza is in the “sack?” What if Cindy is with you when he asks that question? What if Eliza herself comes down and causes a scene?\n\n\n\n“Hey you! Come here we need another doctor in ER!” a nurse shouts at you.\n\n\n\nYou stop your current daydreaming and quickly follow her to the emergency room\n\n\n\n“She’s not breathing!”\n\n“Does anyone know what she took?”\n\n“Her employer said she thinks it was Bog Malice.”\n\n\n\nThe noisy chaos of the emergency room seems to go silent when you step forward to see the girl lying on the table.\n\n\n\nIt’s Eliza.\n\n\n\n“Don’t just stand there, hand me that pump!”\n\n\n\nYou snap out of your daze and grab the pump the surgeon asked for.\n\n\n\n“This isn’t working, the poison’s too damn strong. Her body is probably completely shutting down. Where the hell are those electro-gauntlets?”\n\n“NO, she can’t die!” you shout. “Hand me a syringe of Troll Adrenaline!”\n\n“Troll Adrenaline? Her body can’t take that!” a nurse says\n\n“She’s already fucking dying! Somebody gimme that syringe now!”\n\n\n\nYou shove the syringe deep into her chest and inject the adenaline. This causes Eliza’s body to begin to twitch violently and she even opens her eyes. She then spits up a mixture of blood and some sort of black fluid.\n\n\n\n“Huuuuuuuuuu!” Eliza wheezes\n\n\n\nA nurse rushes in with electro-gauntlets and you grab them immediately and lay your hands on Eliza’s chest.\n\n\n\n“CLEAR!”\n\n\n\nBUZZ!\n\n\n\n“CLEAR!”\n\n\n\nBUZZ!\n\n\n\n“CLEAR!”\n\n\n\nBUZZ! SPARK! FWOOM!\n\n\n\nThe electro-gauntlets short out and you end up giving yourself a nasty zap causing you to fall to the floor. It doesn’t take you long to realize the gauntlets are also on fire. You shake them off immediately. You smell the scent of burnt flesh and scramble back up to help Eliza who has now once again ceased to move.\n\n\n\n“Oh shit, shit! I’m sorry Eliza! I’m so fucking sorry!” you say and begin pounding on her chest, but it’s no use\n\n\n\n“You tried everything you could my boy, she’s gone.” The surgeon says trying to calm you down.\n\n“No, but look her foot just twitched, she…”\n\n“That twitch was just an after effect of the troll adrenaline. (Sigh) Never gets easy losing a patient…and I gather you knew this one personally?”\n\n“…yeah…she…yeah…”\n\n\n\nYou stumble out of the emergency room and see your mother who must’ve been the one who brought her here.\n\n\n\n“Son! Is Eliza…”\n\n“She’s dead.”\n\n\n\nAfter the funeral you take time off from work. Cindy tries to be sympathetic, but the fact that you feel really guilty over Eliza’s death and incredibly broken up about it leads her to quite rightly think that you had stronger feelings for her than you let on. Ultimately Cindy breaks up with you and eventually moves back to the Delantium Kingdom by herself.\n\n\n\nEventually you go back to work and continue on with your life. You never do forgive yourself for Eliza’s death though and immerse yourself in your work.\n\n\n\nAs for your family’s inn, your mother continues to run it until the day she dies. You get the impression her concern for you caused her to stay rather than retire to Teckleville like she once planned. Upon her death you sell the inn, as you have no desire to run the place. The owner of a chain of inns from the Delantium Kingdom ends up buying it.\n\n\n\nDue to your focus on your job, you end up becoming a more dedicated doctor with many patients speaking highly of you. In time you even win an Excellence in Medicine Award. You graciously accept these awards and praise, but you always think back of what you should’ve done differently to save the one life you feel directly responsible.\n\n\n\nYou think Eliza’s suicide could’ve been prevented if only you’d kept your mouth shut that day. Or maybe you should’ve pursued her harder. Or maybe you should’ve done something else. You routinely mentally torture yourself with all the possible better ways you think you could’ve handled things. As a result you never marry and place flowers on her grave site on a weekly basis.\n\n\n\nYour own death is a sudden one at home that comes to you many years later well into an age when you should’ve long retired. When your body is found, your last request in your will is carried out. Your body is cremated and the ashes sprinkled over Eliza’s grave.\n",
  "page 115": "You have to go for this. Even if doesn’t work out you’ll always be wondering “What if?”\n\n\n\nBut before you can do anything, you have to break up with Cindy first. You aren’t looking forward to it, but in a way you feel it’s probably for the best no matter what happens with Eliza. You don’t particularly want to move and you’re happy where you’re at right now. Cindy’s been dominating your relationship since you’ve been together and it’s time to put an end to it.\n\n\n\nWhen you get home, Cindy’s already there questioning where you’ve been. You take a deep breath and say what’s on your mind about her whole plan to move and how you’re not into the idea. This of course has the predictable result of causing an argument, but Cindy’s not an idiot. She KNOWS there is more to it than just the moving. She continues to press the issue of where you’ve been before you came to tell her this new revelation.\n\n\n\nEventually you just tell her everything about how you also have feelings for Eliza. Cindy becomes very upset and even throws a few objects at you before attempting to hit you with her fists. You manage to fend her off long enough so she stops and just resorts to calling you every swear word in the human language (and a few in some other languages!) before starting to pack her belongings.\n\n\n\n“Cindy, I’m really sorry, I didn’t want it to be like this, I just…”\n\n“Save it asshole. I can’t believe I fell for you! I see now that you can take the boy out of the gutter, but you can’t take the gutter out of the boy. I hope you and your trashy barmaid have a good life together because you certainly deserve each other. Oh and don’t think you’re getting away with this insult. My wrath will be terrible. This, I fucking vow dickhead!”\n\n\n\nAnd with that Cindy leaves while slamming the door of your apartment. It went about as well as you could’ve expected. All you have to do now is talk to Eliza again. You figure you should probably give her a couple days before do so though.\n\n\n\nA few days pass and after work you head over to the inn.\n\n\n\n“Oh it’s you. I suppose you’re looking for Eliza, well she’s here. Dunno where though. Y’know, you should’ve just tried to hook up with me instead. Hell I wouldn’t have even cared if you still wanted to stay with Cindy.” Rita says.\n\n“Yeah, just as long as I bought you something nice and expensive right? Sorry, I don’t go for gold digging whores.”\n\n“Oh fuck you, Mr. big shot doctor! Don’t try to play moral superiority on me with all the drama you got going on!”\n\n“I wasn’t playing anything and none of this is about you anyway, despite the fact that you like to think everything is.” You retort and leave.\n\n\n\nAfter a quick scan of the room, you don’t see Eliza. You head over to the bar where Wendy is located.\n\n\n\n“Wendy where’s Eliza?”\n\n“You’re back a lot earlier than I expected. You just cost me 20 coppers in the bet we had going. But nevermind all that, I’d just like to say, that you really fucked up with how you handled this situation. I hope you’ve at least had the sense to break over with that snooty bitch before trying this again.”\n\n“Cindy’s not…” you begin to say still feeling the need to defend her, but you stop yourself “(Sigh) Yeah, yeah I did. And I’m probably going to pay for it later.”\n\n“We all pay for our mistakes in some way. She’s in the kitchen. And hey! Be gentle with her, she’s been upset for the past few days and in a fragile state right now.”\n\n\n\nYou nod and enter the kitchen.\n\n\n\nUpon entering the kitchen all eyes turn to you. Eliza’s, your mother’s, the other workers you don’t know, everyone. You half expect Eliza to run off again, but she doesn’t in fact she seems ready to confront you.\n\n\n\n“Um, Flameflower can you be in charge of the staff for a little while?” she asks.\n\n“Can I? I’ve waited for this day to come!” Flameflower gleefully says in semi-power drunk glee and then telling everyone to quickly get to work. Her sister Sunshine looks a little jealous. You knew Eliza had managed to instill a work ethic into them, but you didn’t think either of them would jump on the chance for more responsibility.\n\n\n\n“If you two are going to talk here at the inn, I suggest one of the empty rooms upstairs and I’d rather you not cause such a scene this time.” You mother says.\n\n“We won’t.”\n\n\n\nYou and Eliza exit the kitchen through the back way.\n\n\n\n“Hey wait doesn’t this lead to your family’s living quarters?” Eliza asks.\n\n“Yeah, and what better place to talk? Nobody will be there, nobody will interrupt us and if something upsetting does happen, a scene won’t be caused.”\n\n\n\nYou take Eliza to the living area to talk. You notice she’s shaking a bit.\n\n\n\n“How come you’re shaking?”\n\n“I’m nervous. I’ve been nervous about all this for the past few days. I didn’t know what was going to come next. I didn’t even know if you were going to come back after what I said to you.”\n\n“What you said? If anything, I should be the one apologizing for all the stuff I did. I mean I mean you were right, I dumped all this stuff on to you suddenly, I also just grabbed and kissed you the way I did. That was really out of line, I’m sorry about that.”\n\n“It wasn’t so much the kiss that bothered me, it was just the situation in which it happened really. I always believed our first kiss…if we ever had one, would be under different circumstances.”\n\n\n\nYou take a deep breath before continuing.\n\n\n\n“Well I feel you should know, I’ve broken up with Cindy.”\n\n“You really broke up with her?”\n\n“Yes, she’s vowed revenge on me and everything.”\n\n“Revenge? You don’t think she’ll do anything crazy or violent do you?”\n\n“I don’t think so and least I hope not. Look, I’ll deal with it when it happens. The point is, I want you to know is I’m here for YOU now. If this means your ready, then I’m ready too. If this means you still need some time, I’ll back off and wait. If that means you don’t want me at all, then fine I’ll leave you alone.”\n\n\n\nEliza takes your hand.\n\n\n\n“I don’t want you to leave. I’ve waited a long time for this moment, but I still have concerns about whether we’ll really be happy together or not. I mean what if you come to the conclusion one day that you’ve made a mistake breaking up with Cindy. I’d hate for you to start resenting me for that.”\n\n“Eliza, my breaking up with Cindy wasn’t only for you. I mean I hate to admit it, but yeah perhaps there were selfish reasons for breaking up with her as well. Like not wanting to have her plan our entire life out with minimal say on my part. I really should’ve broken up with her earlier (Sigh) I really did handle this poorly. I just hope you can forgive me for putting you through all this.”\n\n\n\nYour talk with Eliza goes on for awhile, eventually you both agree on taking things slow at first, but the pair of you are pretty happy about this new relationship.\n\n\n\nTime passes and your relationship with Eliza is going well. Unfortunately Cindy is true to her word and takes revenge even after she leaves Klyton.\n\n\n\nShe doesn’t do it directly, but rather indirectly, namely through her father’s business connections. The price of booze distributed to your family’s inn is increased, the food too. Most of the traveling merchants that used to stay at the inn now have taken their business elsewhere. Your family’s inn takes a huge loss, and it ends up resulting in laying off most of the staff.\n\n\n\nWhile your mother could keep the place running even with all the cut backs, she ultimately decides it isn’t worth it and sells it altogether in a few years. Naturally Cindy’s father makes sure his people are the ones that get a hold of it. The revenge tries to continue on directly through price gouging from a few shops you buy from, but you manage to put an end to that, by reminding the various owners that you’re a doctor and how pissing you off might not be beneficial for their health plan should they ever get sick in the future.\n\n\n\nYou apologize to your mother for the situation with the inn however, but she tells you not to worry about it. She got enough from the sale and is moving to Teckleville like she originally planned. She just hopes that you and Eliza will visit every once in awhile.\n\n\n\nWith Eliza out of a job, she moves in with you. It becomes permanent when you get married. Eventually you also move to Teckleville to start a private practice and soon Eliza gives birth to twins and you start the next phase of your relationship as a family.\n\n\n\nOverall your life with Eliza is a good one and you never regret your decision even if it did result in the loss of your family’s inn. Besides you always had the best thing that was ever connected to that place and really that’s what was important.\n",
  "page 43": "Making any changes might make things worse than they are and you’re already got enough problems as it is. The only thing you can reliably control is yourself so you decide to cut a few corners in your studies. It’s not like you won’t completely know the information, it’s just between studying and managing the inn to make money for school, the money aspect is more important to your future in medicine…\n\n\n\nThis twisted logic doesn’t work so well.\n\n\n\nFirst of all your inn isn’t really doing any better with you around more often. You’re still breaking even and your staff is still unhappy for the most part. Second of all, you spend nearly as much time scamming and scheming for your tests that you probably could’ve better spent it studying. Lastly, you’re going into the medicine, it’s not like law where you can just bullshit your way through and by it’s very nature you can’t really “cheat” at least not for very long. Some tests just can’t be cheated on and this becomes apparent during your advanced anatomy and physiology final where you’re presented with a real dead body and you get several parts of it laughably wrong.\n\n\n\nYOU FAIL BASIC HUMAN BIOLOGY FOREVER is what is actually posted on your paper by your professor. You don’t do too much better in the rest of your classes. What this all means is you have to repeat most of your classes which means more money, or at least that’s what it would mean if you were rich. Since you aren’t, the university just throws you out since you failed to meet the academic standard.\n\n\n\nWell all your short cuts, the home brewed hooch, the overworked staff, the cheating, it has all amounted to nothing. Sure you still have the inn, and if you made some cuts you could keep it running, but why bother? You never wanted to run this damn thing in the first place. This is all your parents fault, they pushed you in one direction and then they fuck up and you have to go into another direction. A direction which ended up leading to ruin. At this point you’re so fed up with busting your ass to get shit done, you decide to not do anything at all. Basically, you don’t learn your lesson from all this.\n\n\n\nFirst thing you do is sell the inn for as much as you can. Not as much as you like, but it’s enough to keep you from having to do anything for a while. You spend the next few months mainly picking up loose co-eds at the university. It’s a lot of fun, but as the money starts running out, you realize you’re going to have to get a job again.\n\n\n\nYou wind up getting a job as a lowly clerk doing boring file keeping, but you pretty much slack off on that job quite a bit. You mostly get away with it for a long time, but eventually much like your cheating you don’t get away with it forever and you’re fired.\n\n\n\nAfter a couple more failed attempts at keeping a job in the city, you’ve got no choice, but to either become a beggar or apologize to your mom in Teckleville and hope she takes you in for a while.\n\n\n\nYou take the remaining amount of your money and take a one-way trip to Teckleville and mentally prepare yourself for a lot of apologizing, even if you don’t really mean it. When you arrive you meet up with your mother (who now has her own place as opposed to living with your aunt Enora). She’s surprised to see you and isn’t immediately hostile. You explain your situation though omit some of the information (like cheating) and replace it with a hard luck story instead. This of course is followed by a lot of apologies and stating how she was right all along. It works and she takes you in.\n\n\n\nOf course the problem is now you’re living with your mom and while she’s forgiven you, she doesn’t expect you to sit around doing nothing which you’ve decided to continue doing. This willful sloth, leads to a cycle of several never-ending arguments, but the result is always the same. You either get a odd job around the town to get your mom off your back for awhile or she throws you out and you live with your crazy aunt Enora for awhile until you can’t put up with her quirkiness anymore and you get an odd job around town anyway and beg to move back in with your mom (who always accepts mainly because she still has a lingering feeling of guilt that maybe her and your dad really are responsible for your decline).\n\n\n\nThe rest of your life is a rather miserable one and not very interesting in the scheme of things. You always remain bitter about “what you could’ve been” and this of course results in you thinking about that damn inn a lot and what you could’ve done differently.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 87": "You can’t tell your mother what you did; she’d never forgive you. Frank is probably just bluffing. Even if he did say something to the Klyton Militia there’s no evidence and they probably wouldn’t believe him anyway. Besides he pretty much suggested that Tom and David are dead.\n\n\n\nOf course that makes you worry that he might try to do the same thing to you, your mother or one of your employees. Maybe he wasn’t bluffing.\n\n\n\nFor the next few weeks you become increasingly paranoid asking your employees if they noticed anyone strange following them. You can’t concentrate in class and your grades start to suffer. The stress gets so much that you end up pulling your dad’s Troll Gun on a patron you don’t recognize. Fortunately nothing bad happens, unless you count several people questioning your sanity and no longer entering your inn. Several of your staff grumble about leaving, but it doesn’t quite get to that point.\n\n\n\nYou’ve been so stressed out that you haven’t been able to sleep properly for weeks, you constantly wake up and double check all the locks on the doors and sleep with the Troll Gun next to you. Eventually a wave of exhaustion causes you to collapse and fall into a deep sleep for once.\n\n\n\nYou begin to dream that you’re sitting near a tree studying. A pretty girl in a red dress sits next to you saying that you should come with her instead of putting your nose in a book.\n\n\n\n“I have to study! I have to become a doctor! That’s my goal!” you answer.\n\n“Is it? Or is it some high aspiration that your parents put into your head when you were young? Do you really know what you want? How hard have you pushed yourself only to be thwarted at every turn? Don’t you think you should take time to rest? Come with me.”\n\n“I would like to rest, but I can’t. I have to continue.”\n\n“No, you don’t. You can allow yourself time to take break. You’ve done as much as you can…perhaps more than you should have. But none of that matters now; it’s time to rest. Come with me.”\n\n\n\nThe words of this word are so soothing and she speaks in a way that you find alluring and truthful. Still, you can’t but think you know her from somewhere.\n\n\n\n“…who are you? Do I know you? It seems like I’ve seen you before…” you ask.\n\n“Does it matter? You must come with me now. You may not get another chance.” The woman says in a firm, but gentle tone.\n\n\n\nYou get the impression that she sincerely is looking out for your best interest, so you put down your book and hold her hand as you go walking into the fields with her…\n\n\n\n“I can’t believe he just died in his sleep! He was too young! (sob)” your mother cries.\n\n“I’m sorry for your loss, but he did seem like he was under a lot of stress lately. Dunno what would’ve caused that. Maybe his classes were getting harder and he just couldn’t take it any longer?” Wendy says not really knowing what to say.\n\n“Well, at least he looked peaceful.” Eliza says, tearing up a little.\n\nRita stays quiet the whole time, looking a little nervous about whether or not her “idea” had anything to do with this.\n\n\n\nAfter burying you next to your father, you mother has no more reason to stay in Klyton and sells the inn to Frank before moving back to Teckleville to live with her sister Enora.\n\n \nMeanwhile...\n\n\n\n“So sister, did Frank yell at you for disposing of his competition in such a gentle manner?”\n\n“Hah, that little mage knows not to overstep his bounds. Oh I long for the day when we can figure out how to break his little contract over us. Honestly using us as mere barmaids, it’s degrading.”\n\n“I agree sister, but I will never under stand why you choose to take the delicious life force in the manner you do.”\n\n“Oh sister, you are truly a product of our race. Seduction and then a horrifying end to the victim. It needn’t always be so vulgar. Besides, I sensed so much stress, worry and guilt in him, I figured he could use a peaceful end.”\n",

You’ve also managed to re-establish some old contacts with people you were “friends” with before your “break”. Most of them are ahead of you and some are getting ready to graduate. While none of them bothered to stay in contact with you (so much for education breaking down class distinctions) a few of them are still willing to help you out by selling you books for cheap or giving you some of their old notes. Every little bit helps.\n\n\n\nAs for the inn, it’s doing well, but you constantly worry about its future profitability. Your regular patrons aren’t the upstanding working class anymore, most of them are petty criminals, broke losers and other ne’er-do-wells. You also have to do something about your overworked/underpaid staff. So far Wendy has been doing far more than she anticipated and is demanding more pay. Rita on the other hand is just plain threatening to quit. All of which is cutting into your study and school time.\n\n\n\nA few bright spots are you’re getting adventurers coming in since those nice rooms you got awhile back started to pay off.

The fact that you’re not there for most of the day means she has to oversee most things. Same is true if you have important school work you need to do. She’s basically doing most of the work your mother used to do, but the major exception is she is NOT your mother and has her own kids to worry about. This fact has been brought to your attention directly several times during one of her many rants at you due to her dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\nRita: Barmaid\n\n\n\nRita doesn’t have it nearly as bad as Wendy, but she complains just as much if not more. It is true she’s overworked more than she used to be however. Rita is always arguing with Wendy or you. If she isn’t then she’s taking out her frustration on Eliza or Alan if he gets in the way. She’s still trying to find that “sugar daddy” type to take her away from all of this, but the inn doesn’t get many merchants anymore and those it does aren’t interested in an obnoxious serving wench as a trophy wife. Her threats of quitting are a daily routine.\n\n\n\nEliza: Barmaid\n\n\n\nEliza is more or less her usual quiet self, though it is evident that even she feels overworked since every once in awhile she’ll make a couple of minor grumbles about things.\n\n\n\nAlan: Janitor/Handyman\n\n\n\nThis is your prized employee. He never complains and follows orders. The best thing is he has managed to save you money in repairs since he’s good at that sort of thing. You don’t really know what you’d do without him. Part of you feels a little guilty about making him sleep in the basement and generally treating him like a second-class citizen, but he doesn’t seem to mind. The only problem you have with him is due to his slow mindedness in most things you get frustrated in explaining more complex stuff to him.

I just hope your lizard can do the job.”\n\n“Well I hope so too, because if not, we’re both going to be in for a fight if we have angry succubae after us. I want five hundred gold by tomorrow.”\n\n“Five…that’s a lot.”\n\n“That’s fuckin’ cheap to hire the best! You’re only getting a discount due to the fact that this is something I was thinking about doing anyway! Now if you don’t like the price…”\n\n“No, I can get it. When’s the job going to be done?”\n\n“Tonight if possible, but I suspect it might take my boy into the wee hours of the morning since he’s dealing with other worldly beings and all. If he hasn’t done it by the time you come by with the money tomorrow, then he’s failed and you can keep half of your money because I’m a nice guy. How’s that sound?”\n\n“Erm…good I guess, but I’d rather he succeed.”\n\n“I’m sure he will. So is our business done or did you still want to see the fight pits? I’m sure Olaf’s eating his competitior right about now.”\n\n“Eh, that’s okay I should be getting back.”\n\n“Suit yourself.”\n\n\n\nYou’re able to get a coach back to inn, naturally it’s a lot later now and everyone is asking you where you’ve been. You explain that you forgot to do something at campus for a class, which seems to satisfy as an excuse.\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of the night, you’re preoccupied with your decision. Wondering if it’s going to fail or not. You barely get any sleep and the next day at your classes you can barely concentrate. You basically wander the day in a haze until it’s time for you to go pay Edmond.\n\n\n\nWhen you enter the Troll’s Breath, Edmond points to his office and you follow.\n\n\n\n“Told you my boy could do it. Now aren’t you glad you made this decision? You got my money?” Edmond asks in a friendly tone.\n\n“Yeah…you mean that’s it? It succeeded?”\n\n“Of course it did! I figured you already knew it did given that you’re closer to the Flying Griffon and are friends with all those Klyton militia folks…I mean it’s pretty big news! Flying Griffon Massacre they’re calling it! ”\n\n\n\nYou’ve been so caught up in your own worry you haven’t been paying much attention to outside discussion or events. You feel a sense of relief, but then you question the word…\n\n\n\n“Massacre?”\n\n“Yeah the demons are dead and Frank is going to jail. Seems that the militia think he was making human sacrifices to summon up the demons and it all got out of hand.”\n\n“Wait, why would they think all that?\n\n“Eh, well apparently my boy had some problems understanding the differences in the terms disfigure and dismember, so he killed those human barmaids in a rather gruesome fashion, but on the bright side it completely puts all the blame on Frank. They figured he or the succubae killed the barmaids and then the succubae tried to rebel against their master he was forced to kill them. Being an unlicensed mage certainly doesn’t help him. In any case the heat doesn’t even trace back to us as long you don’t start acting suspicious around your militia buddies, which I trust you won’t.”\n\n“Yeah…”\n\n\n\nYou’re a little in shock as the realization that you’ve just participated in murder. Granted you weren’t doing a good thing anyway, but disfiguring is still a lot different than murder. You don’t say anything since you promised that you wouldn’t whine about having a guilty conscious afterwards.\n\n\n\nEdmond takes your money and makes you stay until it is all counted. When it is, he says you can leave.\n\n\n\n“Oh one more thing. I hear you’re going into medicine. Very useful profession, I could use a competent doctor every once in awhile; gods know that drunk that I currently have on my payroll is barely useful. I hope I can call upon you in the future if I need to.”\n\n\n\nAnd there it is, the “catch” for doing business with a criminal. You could kick yourself in the head for actually believing that this was going to be a straight up transaction. He may not be extorting your inn; he’s just hanging a “favor” over your head in the future. Somehow that’s almost worse.\n\n\n\nThere’s little you can do about it now though, you head back to the inn where your patrons and staff are all talking about what happened at the Flying Griffon. Rita in particular speaks to you about it.\n\n\n\n“Sheesh, I didn’t know you were going to go to that extreme, but can’t say those bitches didn’t deserve it. That’s what happens when you work with demons right? Who knew Frank was a mage? Well at least we don’t have any competition anymore.”\n\n\n\nRita’s callous talk about the Griffon barmaids makes you angry. In fact all of this was Rita’s initial suggestion and while you listened to it, that doesn’t mean she shouldn’t suffer the negative consequences for it too. You snap and grab Rita by the arm roughly and pull her into the cellar. Flameflower and Sunshine are down there drinking your wine supply.\n\n\n\n“Erm…uh…(giggle)” is all Sunshine can utter when getting busted,\n\n“If you two halfbreed bitches don’t get upstairs and start doing some actual work for a change you’re gonna get some of what Rita’s about to get! MOVE!”\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to say it twice, your tone is enough to sober them up and get them moving.\n\n\n\n“What the fuck is wrong with you? You better let me go, and what the hell do you mean I’m getting something? You better not be implying what I think you’re implying. You so much as start grabbing my tits and I’ll scr…”\n\n\n\nYou don’t let Rita finish; you just slam her up against the wall as hard as you can with your hand over her mouth.\n\n\n\n“Bitch I wouldn’t touch your gold digging fuckhole with a ten pole. You think those girls deserved to die? Oh no, you just felt that they needed to be disfigured; well maybe you need to be mutilated. Take your ass down a few notches.”\n\n\n\nAt this point you grab a nearby candle and start holding it need Rita’s face. She pulls away and tears start.\n\n\n\n“Oh what’s the matter? Don’t like being a victim? Well how do you think those girls felt in their final moments?!” you say and throw Rita to the floor.\n\n\n\n“I fucking caused that to happen! And guess what? So did you. So if you’re not going to feel bad about it, you’re at least going to feel bad in other ways. I’m lowering your pay and if you don’t like it, tough shit, you can quit. I can get some other shallow whore to do your job, you’re not special. And if you’re getting some sort of bright ideas about reporting me to the militia or some shit, remember what happened at the Flying Griffon? Well I can make that happen to you too.”\n\n\n\nYou leave on that threatening note, while Rita tries to compose herself. You’re a little surprised that Rita’s “tough girl” act was broken so easily, you’re also surprised at your own actions. The scary part to you is that it was easy and how you feel a lot better now.\n\n\n\nYou exit the cellar and a few moments later Rita follows. This leads to a few whispers amongst your staff. Everyone assumes that you and Rita must’ve had some rough sex. Your mother even approaches you about it.\n\n\n\n“Far be it from me to interfere with your personal life, but if you’re going to insist on having sex with the help, I’d appreciate it if you at least took Rita up to your room and NOT anywhere on the business premises!”\n\n“…okay mom.”\n\n“(Sigh) I mean…(Sigh) Rita? You could do so much better! Sure she’s pretty, but the girl is a shallow gold digger and not even a very good one! Couldn’t you at least picked Eliza? I could’ve understood that, she’s sweet. Or how about a nice girl at your college? You know like one with a bright future ahead of her? (Sigh) I just hope for your sake you didn’t get that little tart pregnant!”\n\n\n\nYou just nod and agree with your mother the whole time. It’s better if everyone thinks that you were fucking Rita rather than the truth anyway.\n\n\n\nWith the Flying Griffon closed down, business picks up and you don’t have as many financial worries any longer. You’re not out of the woods yet though since now you’re in your final stages of your education, which means medical school as well as having to get a job actually working at a hospital. The only problem with that is being an intern doesn’t pay all that well and you certainly can’t do that AND work at the bar.\n\n\n\nYour mother reassures you that you shouldn’t worry about it as she’ll be able to hire a couple extra people as well as being able to help with the rest of your tuition.\n\n\n\nIn any case it looks like your days as an innkeeper are over.\n",
  "page 48": "It’s a risky gamble, but you feel you have no choice.\n\n\n\n“Alright fine, you’re fired.” You say after taking a deep breath.\n\n“Ha ha ha ha! Yeah right.” Wendy laughs.\n\n“I’m not joking, you’re fired and you can pack your bags and get the hell out of my inn too.”\n\n“Wait a minute!”\n\n“No, you’ve made it quite clear you don’t respect my generosity and are just taking advantage of it. I’d expect this sort of behavior from Rita, but I thought better of you.”\n\n“…you can’t fire me! You need me! “ Wendy sputters.\n\n“It’s done. You’re gone. And while you may be right that I do need you, I don’t need your bratty kids. Especially one that’s setting my other employees on fucking fire.”\n\n\n\nYou begin to leave the kitchen and Wendy grabs your arm.\n\n\n\n“Alright, alright! Shit. You win. I can’t afford to lose my job and a free place on top of everything right now. I’ll do something about my kids. (Sigh) I just hope I can do something about Henry. I’m not sure anything is going to help. I have to admit, I’m not looking forward to him when he becomes a teenager.”\n\n“Well, have you thought about sending him away?”\n\n“I wish. I don’t have that sort of money to send him to some boys school, besides he’d probably get kicked out within a week.”\n\n“No, there’s a program that the city militia has been trying to promote lately. It’s basically like boot camp for juvenile delinquents. They say it has good results in turning them around.” You suggest.\n\n“Well I’d try anything I suppose, but doesn’t that cost money as well?”\n\n“No, basically you go down to the local militia guard station and sign your kid up, then at sometime in the middle of the night they take him away for a year.”\n\n“Wow, sounds pretty extreme, but if it’s free hell I’ll try it.”\n\n\n\nThe next few days are slightly quieter. Wendy has obviously laid down the law once again to them, but it won’t last. You really hope she goes through with your suggestion because as much as you are perfectly willing to go through with your threat, you also know it would ruin your own goals.\n\n\n\nLater that night, heavy banging on your inn’s front door and yelling wakes you up.\n\n\n\n“This is the Klyton Militia open up at once! We have important business here!”\n\n\n\nYou smile and head downstairs to open the door, but you find that Wendy has already done it. When they take him away, he doesn’t cry or even protest. He allows himself to go quietly, which makes you believe that you made the right decision in pushing Wendy in this direction. You have your doubts if the militia program will help him, but he’s out of your life now and that’s what is important.\n\n\n\nThe best thing is, this event scared Wendy’s other two kids so much that they straighten up so as not to suffer the same fate.\n\n\n\nTime passes and everything seems to be going well until one day when you get another visit from the Klyton militia who storm in the same way they did when they took away Henry.\n\n\n\n“You the owner of this establishment?” the sergeant asks.\n\n“Yeah?” you answer groggily\n\n“You’re under arrest for serving illegal substances.”\n\n“What?! I don’t sell drugs here!”\n\n“You’re selling homemade booze ain’t cha? Clearly you’re violating alcohol law 3.6721. Gibbs! Check the basement, that’s where it’s supposed to be!”\n\n\n\nYou’re put into manacles and sputter in disbelief at all this. You were careful! Who could’ve ratted you out? None of you patrons would’ve cared given that they drink here. Even your ex-patrons just left due to the alcohol not tasting as good to them, they would’ve have bothered. Your staff? If this place goes down, then they all lose their jobs and if anything you’ve made strides in making things easier for them…shit.\n\n\n\nYou know now.\n\n\n\nIt’s Henry. That little bastard must’ve told all about this place. Whether he did it out of spite for you or his mom or if they really rehabilitated him and he felt it was his “duty” to rat you out hardly matters, you’re fucked.\n\n\n\n“Found them sir. There’s a whole bunch of stills in the basement, along with some retard who seemed confused.” Gibbs reports.\n\n“Ugh, you keep retarded sex slaves in this place too? What the hell are you running here?!” the sergeant says jumping to conclusions.\n\n“Sex slaves? He’s the fucking janitor!” you protest.\n\n“Save it you sicko! You’re coming with us!”\n\n\n\nAs you’re taken away you shout to Wendy who is standing by watching all this, to get the money from the safe to bail you out.\n\n\n\nEventually you’re brought up on charges of distribution of illegal substances, posing a health risk to the populous, exploitation of the mentally incompetent and tax evasion. Guess which one you got in the most trouble?\n\n\n\nYou spend almost all your money on a lawyer, and your inn is taken away by the city, along with your dreams of going into medicine. After all is said and done you’ve lost everything and are completely broke. The only good thing is the city decided that your inn would cover the cost of all the alcohol taxes you weren’t paying due to making your own so you didn’t serve any jail time.\n\n\n\nIt’s of minor consolation though, you’re still left with nothing and don’t have much future prospects. You wish you’d listened to your mother and you think about going to Teckleville to apologize to her in person, but you can’t bring yourself to even face her.\n\n\n\nYou do eventually get another job as a boring assistant clerk. It’s a mind numbing tedious job that does nothing for your mental well-being. After years of this drudge you hang yourself still lamenting about where you went wrong with the inn.\n",
  "page 47": "You can’t afford to fire her and you don’t even want to risk threatening her with it lest she call your bluff and leave.\n\n\n\n“Will you listen to yourself for one moment? All I’m saying is to get your kids in line because they’re not just fucking up MY business, but they’re actually fucking up yours by proxy! If you won’t do it for me, at least do it for your own self-preservation!”\n\n“Sounds like you’re threatening to fire me again. If you’re going to do it, do it and stop beating around the fucking fairy bush shithead!”\n\n\n\nYou shake your head at Wendy’s insults. It’s obvious she isn’t going to listen to reason this way, so you try another tactic.\n\n\n\n“Look, I’m not going to fire you, but you’re going to have to find another place to live. I can’t have your kids screwing up my business like this. If this is unacceptable to you, well I suppose I can’t stop you from quitting, but seriously I think you know I have a point here.”\n\n\n\nWendy is a little caught of guard since she figured you might back down from this completely.\n\n\n\n“Wha… shit. You do have a point. I know they’re little monsters. Look I’ll talk to them, I’ll get them in line.”\n\n“I’m glad you see it my way, but the time for that has passed. I think it would be best for our future working relationship if you didn’t live here anymore.”\n\n“But come on you can’t fucking throw us out like this! I at least need time to find a new place!”\n\n“I’m not throwing you out right now, but you need to find a new place by the end of next month.”\n\n“Okay…okay. But hey, if I manage to get my kids to behave within that time can we stay?” Wendy asks hopefully, which is odd to you considering how she was just behaving. You’ve never seen her act in such a desperate fashion before. In fact you’re pretty surprised she hasn’t called you a bunch of names again, though she might’ve realized now that isn’t going to work.\n",
  "page 80": " \n\nEliza’s idea might be a little complicated, but if you’re going sic the Klyton militia on Frank for something, you’d better at least have some sort of evidence to back it up, real or imagined.\n\n\n\n“Okay Eliza, we’ll go with your plan.”\n\n“What?” Rita exclaims.\n\n“Are you serious?” Wendy adds.\n\n“ Oh, um really?” Eliza says just as surprised as everyone.\n\n“Sure and you’re going to be the one to do it.”\n\n“Oh I couldn’t…I’m far too shy!”\n\n“Oh for…if you’re going to insist on doing this plan, you’ll need someone who can work a room. Of course I’ll expect to be paid extra for this.” Rita volunteers.\n\n“Oh I can see this plan is a GREAT idea.” Wendy says rolling her eyes.\n\n“Everyone be quiet! I’m not using you Rita because quite frankly too many people already know who you are and you’re too obvious. Eliza needs to do it. She’s practically invisible. No offense.”\n\n“Oh none taken, but I just don’t know if I can.”\n\n“Of course you can, you came up with the idea right? We just need to hammer out the details.”\n\n\n\nAfter a few moments of discussion, Eliza says that the easiest way would be to get hired there as a waitress. If Frank questions her, she’ll say that she didn’t like the environment at your place and her co-workers (especially Rita). It should be enough to convince him, but Eliza’s just worried that she won’t get hired due to her looks. She’s a pretty a girl, but she suffers from low self esteem so you try to boost her up a bit with compliments. Hopefully they work and hopefully this plan works.\n\n\n\nA few days later the plan is in motion. Eliza “quits” working at your Inn and works for Frank. In your first secret meeting, she tells you he did know who she was, but apparently he didn’t even question her that much. He was too overjoyed that he was taking help away from you that he hired her right away. Though you wonder if that could be a ruse to lull her into some sort of trap, you tell her to be very cautious.\n\n\n\nThe next time you meet Eliza she’s dressed a lot more provocatively than usual. You can’t help but to comment.\n\n\n\n“Wow, Eliza that uh dress…”\n\n“I know. It doesn’t leave much to the imagination does it? I feel like I’m almost walking around naked and everyone is looking.”\n\n“Oh don’t worry about it, they were looking even before you dressed like that. You are very attractive after all.”\n\n“Oh you don’t need to boost me up anymore, I’m getting over my shyness, though I suppose I don’t have much choice. Now here’s what I’ve found out so far…”\n\n\n\nEliza goes on to say that other than having a lot of beautiful girls working for him she hasn’t found anything out of the ordinary yet. He doesn’t seem to be involved in any illegal activity either.\n\n\n\n“Are you sure there isn’t any prostitution going on?”\n\n“That was the first thing I thought of, but it doesn’t look like it. None of the other waitresses are sneaking off with the patrons to some backroom and I haven’t been asked to do anything unseemly either.”\n\n“Damn…uh I mean that’s good you weren’t put in that position though. So nothing at all huh?”\n\n“Well, the only thing that I noticed that might be odd is two of the girls always seem to be there all the time and sometimes they go off with Frank in the basement for long periods of time. There are rumors that they’re sleeping with him.”\n\n“Well sleeping with the boss might be sleazy, but it’s not illegal.” You say.\n\n“I dunno if it’s that sleazy, I think people can maintain a healthy relationship even if one is in a higher position than the other.”\n\n\n\nThis odd little quip from Eliza puts you off guard for a moment.\n\n\n\n“Uh, well sure, but I doubt if that’s the case with those three.” You sputter.\n\n“Oh I agree, but the thing is, I get the impression it isn’t necessarily sex. It feels like something else is going on with them. I think it’s still worthwhile to stick around a little longer.”\n\n“Okay, but as I’ve said before, be very careful. I wouldn’t want anyone there to find out about you, you’re the only employee I have that doesn’t cause any trouble.”\n\n“I will, but thanks for your concern.”\n\n\n\nYou suddenly feel the need to “correct” yourself.\n\n\n\n“I don’t mean I only care about you as an employee, I mean I also care about you…I mean as a person! Y’know, I don’t want anything to happen to you.” You awkwardly word.\n\n“I know what you mean. And thanks again I appreciate it.” Eliza says with a smile.\n\n\n\nYou tell her the next time you want to meet, but if she finds out anything really important to come to you earlier. As she begins to leave you realize you are starting to develop some feelings for Eliza, though you aren’t sure if she feels the same way, but you get the impression that she has also been dropping a few hints.\n",
  "page 82": "A year has passed and you’re back in college, though it’s not as much fun as it was when you didn’t need to worry about where your tuition was coming from or having something like a job.\n\n\n\nFinding time to study while running the inn is difficult, but fortunately your mother picks up some of the slack when you really need time. You’ve also managed to re-establish some old contacts with people you were “friends” with before your “break”. Most of them are ahead of you and some are getting ready to graduate. While none of them bothered to stay in contact with you (so much for education breaking down class distinctions) a few of them are still willing to help you out by selling you books for cheap or giving you some of their old notes. Every little bit helps.\n\n\n\nAs for the inn, it’s doing well, but you constantly worry about its future profitability. You’ve got a much broader customer base and even classed the place up a bit, but this isn’t without its drawbacks. Namely the Flying Griffon Inn has stepped up its efforts to get back its customers. This has so far involved an aggressive advertising campaign, hiring a bunch of sexy barmaids and special deals. So far it has helped them a lot and if they continue to succeed, your inn is going to start losing money and you can’t have that. It doesn’t help that your place isn’t in as good of a location as the Flying Griffon\n\n\n\nSo first things first, you need to figure out how to deal with Flying Griffon and you call a staff meeting in the hopes of getting some other ideas on how to deal with them.\n\n\n\n“Why don’t you just hire someone to cut up their slutty barmaids? I mean that’s what’s mainly getting the main draw right? Seems like you could easily solve the problem by getting rid of them.” Rita says. Naturally this doesn’t go over well with the others.\n\n“That’s horrible!” Eliza says\n\n“ What? I didn’t say kill them, they’d still be able to work and shit. They just wouldn’t be pretty anymore.”\n\n“Have you gotten so jealous that you’ve gone completely barmy? By the gods, we’re not doing that, we’re not the Crimson Talons!” Wendy shouts.\n\n\n\nAs much as disfiguring Flying Griffon’s staff would solve some problems, you hesitate to resort to such measures.\n\n\n\n“Maybe we could offer deals to traveling merchants like Flying Griffon does, like they get a discount on their rooms?” your mom suggests.\n\n“Not sure if that’s going to help us a lot, unless we make an addition to the inn. It’s not like our rooms aren’t being used. If we start giving discount to merchants we might attract them, but we might not have enough rooms to accommodate them or we’ll be accommodating them, but won’t be accommodating adventurer types who are paying full price.” Wendy says.\n\n\n\n“Well if you’re so knowledgeable Wendy, what’s YOUR solution?” Rita sneers.\n\n“We have a lot of Klyton Milita that come here to drink now don’t we? Why don’t we get some of them to help us? Seems like some very public investigation during heavy business hours would help out a lot and ruin the reputation of Flying Griffon. Hell, maybe they’ll even find something and we’ll really get lucky.”\n\n\n\nYou take all these suggestions into consideration, but you can’t help notice that Eliza looks like she wants to say something.\n\n\n\n“Eliza, do you have a suggestion?”\n\n“Huh? Oh. Um…yes…but I... Just forget it. It’s silly anyway. The rest of your ideas sound better.”\n\n“Eliza, just spit it out!” Wendy demands.\n\n“It’s okay, just tell us.” You say with a lot less intimidation.\n\n“Well okay, but it’s silly. I was going to suggest getting someone on the inside to spy on the place and finding something to use against them. It seems odd that they are managing to attract that much attention with just pretty barmaids when we have our own. I think maybe something else is going on there, like an illegal brothel or something.”\n\n\n\nMost of you are surprised that Eliza came up with something so complex.\n\n\n\n“Well, that’s a very elaborate plan Eliza, but I think we could accomplish the same thing just by sending in our militia buddies to harass them. Like I said, if they do find anything actually incriminating, then its even better.”\n\n“Yes, of course. That sounds like a more efficient idea.” Eliza says.\n",
  "page 81": "Mom: Owner/Cook\n\n\n\nMom’s still around, but it’s mainly to help you out in your effort to put yourself through school.

Rita still claims she’s going to live in a mansion one day and is still looking for that “one guy” that’s going to take her away from all this.\n\n\n\nThis would be more of a concern for you if most guys that were into her weren’t just looking to fuck her a few times and then toss her aside, because if anyone really was interested in more than just her body, they probably wouldn’t put up with her personality for long.\n\n\n\nWendy: Head barmaid\n\n\n\nAlong with serving food and drinks, Wendy tends to help out with the cooking or running the bar when you or your mother need it, but she always lets everyone know that she has the most thankless job out of everyone. Not entirely true, but you’re reluctant to piss her off any further since she keeps things running smoother. She also balances out Rita’s ego. She always says she’s going to quit, but that’s probably not likely due to her having a couple of children to support.\n\n\n\nEliza: Barmaid\n\n\n\nEliza’s still your model employee; she’s still the quiet one and doesn’t make waves. She’s about the only one that hasn’t mentioned any plans on potentially leaving. Wendy wishes she’d take charge a little more, since it would help her out at times.\n\n\n\nFlameflower \u0026 Sunshine: Barmaids\n\n\n\nThese are your newest employees and the pair of them are half-elves which means it’s amazing that they even got jobs considering how full blood elves are notorious for avoiding real work. Still, their human mothers (naturally their elven fathers are absentee dads) seem to want them to learn the value of a copper so here they work. Fortunately Wendy’s a good task master and keeps them from being lazy, but she gets at her wits end at times. Still, the pair of them are pretty and can be good workers when they aren’t goofing off so they do their part for the inn, though Rita obviously doesn’t like either of them since they draw attention away from her.\n",
  "page 40": "Rita is already threatening to quit anyway so you might as well get rid of her, besides you figure you can hire some prettier faces that will complain less and probably work for less as well.\n\n\n\nThe first thing you do is advertise for new barmaids. You get a few takers. Most of them don’t seem much better than Rita though, coming in and demanding more stuff immediately. You’re about to give up when a mother comes in with her two half elven daughters practically begging you to hire them.\n\n\n\nSort of what you’re looking for, young, pretty “exotic” even given that they’re half-elven. Their bloodline is what sort of concerns you though. Elves aren’t exactly known for their hard work ethic.\n\n\n\n“Pfft! You think I don’t know that? Their no good father left to go prance around in the forest again while I have to raise these little leeches!” the mother says. “Look you don’t even have to pay ‘em that much, at this point I just want them to earn their keep around the house!”\n\n“Well, I’ll see what we can do.”\n\n\n\nYou hire Sunshine and Flameflower and explain how things work and what is expected of them. Their mother periodically interrupts to tell them to pay attention and how if they end up getting fired that she’ll be kicking them out of the house. The pair of them seem rather unworried about the situation and do a lot of eye rolling, sighing and even some minor giggling. After all is said and done you tell them to arrive on time tomorrow and go back to work.\n\n\n\n“It’s about time you hired some more help.” Wendy remarks.\n\n“Well, I’m also getting rid of some too, where’s Rita at?”\n\n“She’s out front serving drunks as usual, wait you’re going to fire Rita?”\n\n“Yeah, I can’t afford them and her. Besides I’m getting two pretty faces for the price of one and hopefully less bitching.”\n\n“Sheesh, I know Rita’s a pain in the ass and all, but you really think you should get rid of her? Who’s going to train the new girls? I noticed the pointy ears, I’m guessing they’re half-breeds. Elves have terrible work ethics.”\n\n“I already told them what to do, but I figured you’d be keeping an eye on them most of the time, so you can make sure if they’re working and not goofing off”\n\n“What?! As if I don’t have enough to do around here? Look, I’ll do what I can, but really between the cooking and other shit I do, you expect me to play mother hen to them you’re going to be sorely disappointed.”\n\n“I can’t give you a raise if that’s what you’re angling for.”\n\n“Huh, I wouldn’t dream of being that optimistic, but quite simply I’m stretched thin as it is, I can’t do it all and I think you know that.”\n\n“Yeah, I suppose you’re right, well I guess Eliza will have to do it.”\n\n“HER? Eliza’s a nice girl and all, but I dunno if she’s up to supervising.”\n\n“Well she’s gonna have to, now if you’ll excuse me, I have to speak to her and Rita about the changes around here.”\n\n\n\nWendy shakes her head as you call Rita and Eliza over to speak to them in the kitchen\n\n\n\n“WHAT?! You’re fucking firing me?! After all the shit I’ve done around here?!” Rita predictably reacts.\n\n“Rita, all you do is complain and you’ve been threatening to quit for months! Is this really all that surprising? Hell, I would’ve thought you wouldn’t even give a shit given your attitude.”\n\n“…y’know what? You’re right. I don’t give a shit. I should’ve quit a long time ago. I could get a better job just like that! (snap) Thanks for freeing me from this slave wage shithole, but I’ll just say one thing, without me, this place is gonna fail! You think you can replace me with those little half-breed sluts I saw you with earlier? Yeah right! I’m outta here!” Rita says and makes a dramatic exit by shouting to the various patrons of how they should take a good look at her ass as she walks out the door, because it’ll be the last time they see it around the inn.\n\n\n\n“Oh my!” Eliza exclaims.\n\n“Whatever. Okay, now I have to talk to you too…and don’t worry I’m not firing you.” You say before Eliza jumps to that conclusion.\n\n\n\nYou explain to Eliza that it’ll be part of her job to train the new girls. She’s surprised and nervous as you’d expect, but you try to reassure her that she’ll be fine.\n\n\n\nInitially things are shaky. Eliza isn’t very authoritative and often Wendy or you have to step in to lay down more discipline in the half elven sisters. A couple more months pass and it’s obvious things are not working out. Sunshine and Flameflower work, but in a very half-assed way. Even Rita did her job. The sisters are prone to flirt a lot to the patrons, which is good…but not so great when they tend to disappear with said patrons for a few hours. This wouldn’t be a problem if you were running a brothel and making money on this, but you aren’t and it’s too late to start now.\n\n\n\nYou get angry with Eliza and tell her that she needs to get a leash on them, but all this does is make Eliza more nervous and cry that you’re yelling at her. You try to get Wendy to help more, but she complains about how she told you in advance that she can’t do anymore than what she’s doing now. Ultimately she quits because she’s getting burned out. This is soon followed by Eliza who is so stressed out that she can’t take it anymore. As for Flameflower and Sunshine, you don’t even bother firing them since they just stop coming in one day.\n\n\n\nAt this point your school work is taking a small dive due to your only source of income crumbling. You see the writing on the wall and decide to sell the place hoping that you can finish up at least the year. You aren’t going to be able to become a doctor, but MAYBE you’ll be able to get a good job with your education level. You feel slightly bad about Alan who you have to run off because he doesn’t completely understand why he has to leave.\n\n\n\nYou don’t get quite as much money as you’d like for the inn, mainly because the place had gone down hill quite a bit during the time your father ran it, but you finish out the year.\n\n\n\nAs for getting a job, you manage to get one, but it’s working as an office clerk in the city. Maintaining records, filling out shit, etc. It’s tediously dull work, but to a certain extent you’re just glad to not have to worry about that damn inn anymore.\n\n\n\nOver the years, you settle into your mundane life. You’re always a little bitter about your situation, but you try to make the best of it. It isn’t a terrible life, but you always wonder what you could’ve done differently.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 84": "You need professionals for this and David and Tom don’t qualify. You ask for directions to the underground gladiator matches, but Mr. Reynolds still insists on a bit of money for that information, so you have no choice but to pay him.\n\n\n\nAfter running back and forth to his office and the inn, (And incurring some questions by your mom and staff where you’re going) you pay him and he tells you that it’s located in a tavern called the Troll’s Breath on the edge of the warehouse district. He tells you to that can let the bartender know that he sent you.\n\n\n\nYou feel like you’re going to get mugged around every corner on your way to the place, but fortunately that doesn’t happen. You are approached by several prostitutes and offered Cloud Rock a lot though. When you walk in the place, it’s filled with a rowdy bunch as you’d expect. You try not to make eye contact and walk straight to the bar.\n\n\n\n“Yeah?” the bald bartender asks gruffly.\n\n“Mr. Reynolds sent me because of my interest in games.”\n\n“Did he now? Alright, but the next time you see that dick, tell him his time as an independent loanshark are coming to an end soon. He needs to join up with the Crimson Talon or get the fuck outta Kyton. Door’s around the back.”\n\n“Thanks, oh uh one more thing.”\n\n“What!?”\n\n“Is there anyway to speak to Olaf or Silence after their fights?”\n\n“What the hell do you wanna be talkin’ to those two idiots for? The pair of them together barely have enough intelligence to put on their own boots.”\n\n“It’s a business proposition.”\n\n\n\nAt this point the bartender’s eye narrow.\n\n\n\n“Wait a fucking minute. You’re sent here by Reynolds and you wanna talk to Olaf and Silence about a business proposition? This sounds like Reynolds trying weasely shit as usual. Fuck you, they don’t freelance anymore. They’re pit fighters for the Crimson Talons until I say otherwise! Now get the fuck outta here!”\n\n“Okay, I’ll talk with you then, how much do you want for their services temporarily?”\n\n“I said they ain’t for fuckin’ hire you dumbfuck! If you wanna meet them so bad though, I can oblige and throw your ass in the ring with them!”\n\n\n\nAt this point the bartender snaps his fingers and two thugs grab your arms ready to carry you off. You make one desperate plea.\n\n\n\n“Alright! Alright! I’ll hire whomever else you got then! These two guys holding me will do, I just need some people fucked up and I got money to give to whoever will do it!”\n\n\n\nThe bartender nods and you’re released.\n\n\n\n“Alright in my office and start talkin’ fast. Reg, you’re at the bar.”\n\n\n\nYou follow the bartender upstairs to a room that is much nicer than the rest of place. He sits down at a fancy desk and pours himself a drink, but doesn’t offer you anything. You look around the office at the various items he has on the wall until you’re interrupted.\n\n\n\n“Well? Are we just wasting my time here while you admire my office, because the fight pit is another place you can admire from the inside.”\n\n\n\nYou quickly explain everything and your situation and give him the information that Rita wrote down for you. The bartender nods a bit while playing with his ring. When you’re done, he speaks.\n\n\n\n“Is that it? You wanted to hire two bruisers like that to cut up some barmaids? You’re sort of new at this I take it. Those two would’ve probably raped and broke all their necks right in the middle of the fucking Flying Griffon. Subtlety is not their strong point.”\n\n“Okay so do you have someone else in mind?”\n\n“Sure, got a mean ass Sotakan assassin that could easily do the job.”\n\n“A Sotakan? One of those lizard people? But they avoid cities.” You say.\n\n“That they do, but let’s just say I acquired this one from an egg. The great thing about him, is he’s completely loyal and doesn’t require much. Just does what he’s told.”\n\n“How’s he sneak around though? I mean seems like he’d stick out.”\n\n“Hah, those lizard bastards have natural camouflage abilities. As they grow up they adapt to whatever sort of environment they grow up in. Now a regular swamp dwelling Sotakan would stick out, but not my boy. He’s lived here in the city his whole life, took him out in the night to get acquainted with the surroundings while he grew up and now he’s practically invisible when he wants to be.”\n\n“Okay well that’s great, but I don’t need them killed.”\n\n“Heh, maybe not all of them, but a couple may come back to kill you. I think I may have a little more information on the Flying Griffon than your barmaid found out. Frank’s an unregistered wizard. Well wizard’s giving him a little too much credit perhaps, but he’s managed to snag himself a couple of succubae as barmaids.”\n\n“What?! He can’t summon demons into the city! That’s illegal!”\n\n“Oh and I suppose what we’re doing is?”\n\n“Alright, but it’s not only illegal, but it’s a potential danger to the city.”\n\n“No, I agree. Demons tend to fuck up business and their chaotic ways are too much of a risk to deal with, but then again I don’t have to tell you that.”\n\n“So…how do you know all this?”\n\n“Because it’s my fucking job to know shit that might interfere with business that’s why. I kept wondering why some of my merchant contacts weren’t stopping by here anymore. Frank might have some control over his ladies, but I know he can’t completely stop their appetites. Rather short sighted of him really, it’s not like they’re going to be able to stop themselves from completely draining victims forever. They’re going to eventually get out of hand and he’s going to start having to explain to the Klyton militia why people are always last seen going into his place before mysteriously disappearing. You must’ve really pissed him off for him to resort to this.”\n\n“Yeah, I guess so…so where does that leave us?”\n\n\n\nThe bartender (who mentions his name is Edmond and is definitely more than just bartender) says that he was keeping an eye on the Flying Griffon and if he lost anymore of his merchant contact to it, he was going to act. He didn’t before since as skilled as his lizard is, he’s not sure if he can take two succubae by himself, in fact it would be easier to just try and kill Frank. But of course then there would be two unleashed succubae running around in Klyton and nobody really wants that.\n\n\n\nStill, if you’re willing to pay then Edmond will readily accept your money, and he’ll have the mortal barmaids disfigured and the demonic ones killed. He assures you that unlike Mr. Reynolds this will be a straight up agreement and that the Crimson Talons will not seek to extort your inn in some way. Mainly due to all the Klyton militia and adventurers going there it wouldn’t be worth the trouble. He doesn’t need to risk some do gooder or gung-ho orderly type sniffing around.\n\n\n\nOf course you’ve been overwhelmed by all this information. Part of you wonders if all this is worth it. You could wait it out, Edmond did claim that Frank probably won’t be able to control them forever; the problem with this is in the meantime it’ll still be cutting into your business.\n\n\n\nWith this new information you could also report Frank to your militia buddies, though this might be difficult without evidence. Still, you’re on good terms with most of the ones that frequent your place and they’ll probably investigate.\n",
  "page 83": "Getting Olaf and Silence seems unlikely now, you’re sure you could probably travel the seedy underbelly of Klyton and hire some other Crimson Talon thugs, but you’d really rather not. Besides, you actually “know” David and Tom to a degree so you feel slightly more comfortable with them.\n\n\n\n“Splendid! Now David and Tom, you go back with your old friend here and I’m sure he can fill you in on more details. I expect to see the pair of you soon with the money.” Mr. Reynolds before he goes back writing in a ledger.\n\n\n\nYou, David and Tom all walk back your inn. This whole thing feels a little surreal, like you’re all back in primary school again.\n\n\n\n“So. What brings you back to the old neighborhood? Thought you were gonna be a rich doctor or some shit.” David asks.\n\n“Ehh, long story. I’ve actually been back for awhile running my dad’s inn. Still taking classes, just not living on campus anymore.”\n\n“Yeah heard about your dad dying. Wish mine was dead; mean old fucker’s still alive. Never talk or see him anymore though after he kicked me out of the house.”\n\n“…huh….uh so Tom what’s been going on with you?” you ask changing the subject.\n\n“Me? Um, nothing. Me and David just work for Mr. Reynolds beating people up who don’t pay. So you owed him money before we worked for him?”\n\n“Well, not me, but my family borrowed some. It’s all in the past though.”\n\n“That’s good. It would’ve been weird seeing each other again under those circumstances. I don’t think I could intimidate your mom. She was always so nice, not like my mom.”\n\n“That’s because your mom’s still a big ass scary dyke that’s why!” David taunts.\n\n“Shut up David! My mom’s not a dyke! She just has a roommate!”\n\n\n\nSome things never change…\n\n\n\nSpeaking of moms, it occurs to you that actually taking them to the inn to talk probably isn’t a good idea as your mom will probably start asking you all sorts of question on why you’re hanging out with your old hoodlum friends. Instead you go into an alley.\n\n\n\n“Okay, here’s a list of the girls you need to confront, their names, descriptions, and even addresses for most of them.”\n\n“Shit, what the hell did you stalk ‘em or something? Sounds like you could’ve done this yourself.” David remarks.\n\n“I didn’t stalk them, I just have an overly enthusiastic employee motivated greatly by jealousy. Now I’m depending on you guys to do this right.”\n\n“Relax, we’re professionals now. None of this getting caught in the candy store for us anymore.”\n\n“Okay, so how long do you think this will take you?”\n\n“Ehhh, we can probably get this done in a few days if we hurry. Quite a few targets, but it really shouldn’t take long. Probably get most of them after they leave work or going to work. I assume we’ll meet at your inn when the job’s done?”\n\n“Uh no, we’ll meet over in the park around five, where we used to play Smash Sphere in a couple days. If you haven’t finished the job by then, we’ll meet again there in two more days and that should hopefully give you enough time.”\n\n“I told you we’ll be done before then, but fine we’ll do it this way since you think your inn is obviously too good for us…”\n\n“That’s not…”\n\n“Bullshit! The very fact that we’re talking in this alley is an indication that you don’t want us in your place.”\n\n“Is that true? I thought we were friends?” Tom asks being slow on the uptake as usual.\n\n“David, I have certain patrons and I can’t have known criminals walking around the place, not to mention my mom…”\n\n“Fuck you, mama’s boy. All that fancy learnin’ and you still live with your mom. We may be lowly thugs but at least we’re not still livin’ at home. Rather be a goon for hire than a hypocrite like you. Too good to have us at your fancy ass inn, but not too good to hire us to wipe out the competition eh?”\n\n\n\nYou’re silent for a moment after David’s accurate statement, but you’re not going to let him get away with talking like that to you even if it does mean a possible beating.\n\n\n\n“…Alright, fine David. You got me, I’m a fucking hypocrite, is that what you want to hear? At least I tried to do something with my fucking life rather than just rot in juvie for most of my youth and live a hand to mouth existence as some dumb ass goon. So are you gonna do the fucking job or what?”\n\n\n\nDavid starts laughing.\n\n\n\n“Sheesh, I was just fucking with you. You always did take shit so seriously. Anyway yeah we’ll get right on this. See ya in a couple days mama’s boy. Heh.”\n\n\n\nYou part company with David and Tom hoping that you’ve made the right decision.\n\n\n\nA few days pass and you wait at the park at the time you mentioned. Time passes and neither has shown up yet and you start feel anxious.\n\n\n\n“I have to say, I’m surprised at the lengths you went through to compete with me. I never expected you to pull something like this. You might’ve succeeded in this clumsy attempt, but a couple of my employees were a little more skilled than your thugs.”\n\n\n\nIt’s Frank, the owner of The Flying Griffon. You’re so shocked that you can’t even come up with an excuse. It doesn’t matter though since Frank isn’t done talking.\n\n\n\n“Don’t bother with excuses, I know everything. Your little friends proved quite talkative when questioned. On the brighter side for you, you won’t have to pay them now.”\n\n“They’re dead?”\n\n“Oh I wouldn’t know about such things, but I do know they won’t be troubling anyone else any longer. Now the question is what to do about you?”\n\n“…you don’t need to do anything about me…in fact I suggest you don’t. I’m friends with several Klyton militia and an investigation would certainly follow if I were to suddenly disappear.”\n\n\n\nFrank smirks and your attempt to intimidate him.\n\n\n\n“Truly? Might I also tell these same militia friends of your of how you hired two thugs to cut up my employees? But let’s get to the point, you’ve done a lot of damage to my business and I think some reparations are in order. I want your inn. Or rather your mother’s inn.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You heard me. That’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of this mess you’ve dug yourself into. I’ll of course give you a few days to make preparations. Don’t bother asking if you can still live or work there, I‘m afraid I just couldn’t trust someone who has shady dealings.”\n\n“And if I say no?”\n\n“I’d advise against it. That’s all I’m going to say. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back, we’re a little understaffed lately.”\n\n\n\nYou quickly make your way back to the inn lamenting the mess you’ve gotten yourself into. You glare at Rita on your way in while everyone else asks you where you’ve been. You’re distracted all night and your mother notices it the most. At the end of the workday she asks if there’s anything wrong.\n",
  "page 42": "Again, the inn isn’t really like how it used to be where you’d get miners coming in wanting some food with their ale. Nowadays you just get plain ol’ drunks coming in. Even the adventurers don’t normally order anything fancy. You figure you’ll just cut down on food shipments and jack the price up so only adventurers or perhaps the odd merchant will be willing to pay for a hot meal.\n\n\n\nYou also decide that Wendy is a pretty vital part of running this place, so you offer her the only thing you can think of that would keep her happy…\n\n\n\n“Less kitchen work and a free permanent room? Are you serious?” Wendy says in disbelief.\n\n“If you want it. The catch is though, you’d be living here and need to make sure things are running smoothly on a regular basis, this means opening up the inn early, closing it down late, or whatever else is required.”\n\n“Pfft, I basically do that now.”\n\n“Perhaps, but now you’d get to live at a place rent free, not to mention you don’t need to walk that far to work anymore. Now that should certainly alleviate some of your problems I trust?”\n\n“Yeah, that would help a lot.”\n\n“Good, oh one more thing, I know you have kids, I really hope they won’t be running all over the place bothering patrons.”\n\n“No, it won’t be a problem. Y’know I had my doubts about you running this place and while I know me living here is going to make it more convenient for your own goals, thanks all the same.”\n\n“You’re welcome.” You say and feel positive that this decision is going to work out just fine.\n\n\n\nA few months pass and your inn is making a little more money and you have a little more time for your academic goals. Things are nice for a little while, but as usual a problem crops up to make you life a lot more difficult.\n\n\n\nWendy’s kids are little monsters. Not to you, but to just about everyone else. Wendy tries to keep them in line through screaming and beatings, but it doesn’t work for long.\n\n\n\nHer youngest Carl is a dirty little boy who is constantly trying to look up Eliza and Rita’s dresses or touch them in some inappropriate way. If he can’t get to them, the local trashy women who frequent the bar will do. Most of the time he tries to play it off like he doesn’t mean anything, but he knows damn well what he’s doing.\n\n\n\nWendy’s daughter Annie is obviously taking after her with the same grasp of verbal swears. She swears so much you initially thought she had Rosette’s Syndrome. Her mouth wouldn’t really be a problem except she’s loud and is always asking the inn guests strange questions (swearing the whole time of course).\n\n\n\nFinally her oldest son, Henry is well on his way to be a future sociopath. The kid will sit in a corner watching everything and everyone with this creepy look like he’d murder everyone if he could. You’ve noticed that knives from the kitchen have been going missing and you never used to come across so many bloody cat heads in the alley before Wendy moved in. While you can’t prove the animal killing or knife theft, you know for a fact that he’s been fucking with Alan. For the past week you’ve noticed Alan limping, when you questioned him, he stated it was nothing, but on closer inspection you saw that his shoe was in a burned condition and he had a bruise on his neck. You question it further and Alan finally breaks down and tells you it was Wendy’s son, but states that Wendy’s son was just “playing” that it wasn’t a big deal and he didn’t want him getting into trouble.\n\n\n\nThat’s the last straw for you. You and Wendy need to have another talk about this arrangement.\n\n\n\n“Wendy I need to talk to you now.”\n\n“Can it wait…HEY GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE BASTARD!” Wendy says shouting at one her little demons.\n\n“That’s exactly what we need to talk about.”\n\n“Wha…oh fine.”\n\n\n\nYou and Wendy step into the kitchen and you waste no time in expressing your concerns.\n\n\n\n“Wendy you’ve been a great help her since you moved in, but it was my understanding that you were going to have your kids under better control than you have been.”\n\n“Hey this is the best all of them have been in ages! Besides they haven’t been bothering you and business has been doing okay.”\n\n“Yeah, but at this rate I’m not sure how long that’s going to last with how your kids have been acting lately. Your youngest is sexually harassing Eliza and Rita more than the lowest scum that drinks here. Your daughter is causing some the most hardcore adventurers feel uncomfortable. And your oldest son, hoo boy, you NEED to get that kid on a leash quick and instill some discipline into him because he’s one twisted little pup.”\n\n“Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to fuckhead? You think you can tell me how to raise my goddamn kids? You think it’s fucking easy? You don’t have any, so fuck you! Shit, you ain’t even got a woman, so I’m guessing you ain’t gonna have to worry about it ever. Faggot.”\n\n“And who the hell do you think YOU’RE talking to? I’m your boss and I’m telling you need to get your kids in line! Alan just told me that your oldest son snuck down into basement and gave him a hotfoot while he was sleeping. When Alan predictably woke up, he nearly choked himself because your little psycho set up a wire noose around his neck tied to the table nearby.”\n\n“And you believed Alan?”\n\n“Alan’s a lot of things, but he’s not a liar. If anything I had to drag the info out of him. He was afraid of getting your son in trouble, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he was just afraid of your son period.”\n\n“(Sigh) Even if it is true. So what? That’s just how boys play.”\n\n“That’s how future murderers play. Look, I’m not arguing with you anymore. Your kids are a problem and you said they wouldn’t be. So get your shit together or face the consequences.”\n\n“Fuck you, you gonna fire me? Pfft! Yeah right. Without me, you couldn’t run this place and pursue your precious education at the same time. Hell, I doubt if you could run it period.”\n",
  "page 85": "You can’t hide something like this, so you just confess everything. Your mother says nothing for a moment and then you feel a slap to your face.\n\n\n\n“I can’t believe you would do such a thing. That is not how you were raised! Those poor women! They were just trying to earn a living and you had them disfigured just to hamper the competition? We were doing just fine!”\n\n“No, we weren’t! Frank’s inn was starting to beat the hell out of us in everyway! With the way things were going we wouldn’t have had enough business to support this place let alone me trying to finish up my schooling!”\n\n“Is your schooling more important than basic humanity or even the confines of the law? (Sigh) Nevermind, I suppose some of this is our fault. We pushed so hard for your education that now you’re willing to do anything to achieve it…well there’s only one thing left to do I suppose. Sell this place to Frank.”\n\n“What?! He’s not going to do anything, he’s just bluffing!”\n\n‘And what if he isn’t? What if he decides to do the same thing you did, or worse? No, I’m not living my life like that; I had enough of it with Mr. Reynolds who YOU just recently brought into our lives again by hiring your old hoodlum friends of yours. So first thing I want you to do in the morning is to pay whatever you agreed to Mr. Reynolds, I’m sure we can cover it or else you wouldn’t have made the deal. Meanwhile I’ll talk to Frank to hammer out the agreement.”\n\n“So that’s it then? We’re just giving up?”\n\n“Nobody’s giving up son. I stayed to help you as much as I could, but I can’t stand by and help you anymore if you’re going to engage in criminal activity. I’m selling this place and saving you from yourself. Now if you decide to continue being involved in criminal activity, well…I suppose I can’t stop you, but in any case I’m moving back to Teckleville.”\n\n\n\nYou protest, yell and accuse at your mother for a good half hour, but her mind is made up and eventually she just closes her door and goes to sleep.\n\n\n\nThe next few days go according to your mother’s wishes. Mr. Reynolds is paid, though he does wonder about where David and Tom are, you tell him that maybe he should take that up with Frank. The Traveller’s Inn is sold to Frank and your mother doesn’t give you any of the money from the sale. She just wishes you well and knows that with your intelligence you’ll be able to find work before she moves back to Teckleville.\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t need to be said that you’re very angry about all this, at your mother, at Rita, at David and Tom, at Frank, at everyone really, but you’re mainly mad at yourself. You should’ve shown better judgment and now you’ve lost everything.\n\n\n\nYou do manage to find work, but it’s only as a lowly clerk filing away insignificant papers and other dull material. You never really get ahead and your former goals are discarded anyway since you wonder why you wasted all that time studying only for it to all fall apart so spectacularly.\n\n\n\nAs the years pass you only grow more bitter and angry until one day you snap and arrive at work, killing your boss with your dad’s old Troll Gun.\n\n\n\nThe Klyton Militia soon arrive and as you lay dying from several sword blows and a few gunshot wounds all you do is laugh.\n\n\n\n“Thanks dad…you heh heh heh finally came through heh heh heh (sputter) for me…”\n",
  "page 6": " \n\nThe Miner’s Mug Inn hasn’t been some long standing business passed down from generation to generation, it only came into existence due to your grandfather.\n\n\n\nYour grandfather came from a long line of miners, so he became a miner like most men from his neighborhood were. It wasn’t exactly his favorite thing to do, and given the hard work, long hours and dangers (natural and otherwise) it’s understandable that he wanted something better for his own family.\n\n\n\nSo he saved, scrimped, went without and eventually one day he’d saved enough money to buy himself a small building to open up his own business. He’d always remembered that the first thing miners did after work was go get drunk, so why not open up a tavern? He was already friends with a lot of them so he’d at least have a small base to work with.\n\n\n\nThe first few months were a little shaky, but eventually he started turning a profit. It was more than breaking even, but with another child on the way he had to do better than that. He took into consideration the number of merchants who traveled to the city, and thought expanding the business to accommodate them would bring in more revenue.\n\n\n\nBuilding room additions and making his business into an Inn was a good idea, but it was still primarily a tavern at heart in a working class area. Most traveling merchants didn’t want to endure the rabble rousing of drunken miners during the night, especially the snobbier ones from the Delantium Kingdom. Luckily there were customers your grandfather hadn’t considered…adventurers!\n\n\n\nWandering adventurers became a more common sight in Klyton over the years. They were brought there for several reasons such as exploring the mountains, hiring themselves out as mercenaries for the Elven-Sotakan war or just stopping through on their way to Hessla. These types are used to roughing it and something like a little drunken revelry isn’t going to bother them one bit, in fact they tend to engage in it themselves quite a bit.\n\n\n\nWhen your grandfather died, your father ended up taking over the business. He more or less has continued on a conservative path with it. He doesn’t take as many business chances as your grandfather did, probably because he doesn’t have to as it now provides a steady income.\n\n\n\nHe does do a lot of saving since like your grandfather he believes in providing a better life for his children, namely you. If he and your mother have it their way you’ll be going to Klyton University where you’ll study medicine.\n\n\n\nWhether you achieve their wishes or not remains to be seen…\n",
  "page 19": " \n\nYou agree with your mother, you don’t want to take another beating and that was only a punch in the stomach from an ogre. Who knows what they’ll do to you next?\n\n\n\nYou and your mother pack as quickly as you can and catch a late coach heading west. It feels weird leaving Klyton, in fact now that you think about it, you’ve never been out of city before.\n\n\n\nEventually after a couple days the coach stops in Teckleville where your aunt lives. Teckleville is just one of the many small villages on the borders of the Dalantium Kingdom. Probably in time it’ll get absorbed like so many others do, but that’s not really a concern of yours right now.\n\n\n\nYour aunt Enora is happy to see you both, and while this whole living with her thing was sprung on her at the last moment it doesn’t seem to bother her. She says there’s plenty of room and you can stay as long as you like.\n\n\n\nWhile the house is certainly nice and you’re happy to live there rather than in the street, it’s sort of on the small side and you feel like you have no privacy. Teckleville isn’t anything like you’re used to either. The whole small town thing just doesn’t appeal to you, and you feel trapped with a bunch of boring backwards people. It’s even worse than when you were stuck serving the miners.\n\n\n\nYou were supposed to do greater things! Your were going to be a doctor! You did everything right and studied hard and what do you have to show for it? Nothing! You’re stuck in some cow town where the best job you can hope to get is probably shoveling shit. Some future.\n\n\n\n“Thanks dad, you fucking idiot.” You say throwing a rock against a barn door.\n\n\n\nIn time, your mother works at the local tavern where she serves as a cook. It’s not much, but it is something she’s used to doing.\n\n\n\nYou manage to get a job working as an assistant to the mean old bastard who runs the general store. It’s a thankless job, but he’s about the only one who’ll hire you since nobody else will work for him and everyone else thinks you have a superiority complex (Which is sort of true) and won’t hire you.\n\n\n\nThe only upside is since you live at your aunt’s house you manage to save what little money you do make. You have a plan to head to the Delantium Kingdom and start fresh again, because staying here isn’t in your future.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately neither is the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nOne night while you’re sleeping an oversized hand covers your mouth and two more grab your arms. You open your eyes to see Olaf grinning at you in the darkness.\n\n\n\n“What? Did you really think we’d forget about you? Don’t worry about the debt anymore kid, consider it paid with your family’s life.” You hear Mr. Reynolds whisper before he shoves a knife into your stomach and rips it up to your chest.\n\n\n\nThe next day your aunt’s friend finds the bloody bodies of you, your mother and your aunt. The incident becomes known as the Teckleville Massacre.\n",
  "page 5": "Klyton\n\n \n\nThis is the city-state where you live. As far as city-state go it’s not a big one yet, your parents are still able to remember when it was still just considered an “ independent large town”, but when you have steady population growth combined with an good location relatively free of major dangers it’s only natural for a community to grow unhindered.\n\n \nIt is primarily run by a small council of elected officials to govern major matters such as defense of the town, administering punishments for crimes or issuing licenses for magic use. While Klyton doesn’t have a major standing army, it does have a strong voluntary militia to fend off a potential attack, though there has never ever been a serious threat to Klyton. Most militia duties are reserved to protecting miners in the mountains or apprehending criminals. The idea of forming a proper military has always been brought up once in awhile, but again due to the lack of real danger to Klyton, and the cost of keeping a standing army has always been put on the backburner.\n\n \nThe Klytonian community has always been a mostly self-sufficient one, but if anything else is needed, most of their trading is done with the port town of Hessla, the Cloudspeak dwarves or even the Delantium Kingdom. Mining is still a major job field and the beginnings of industrialization is starting, (a couple of small factories have already been built) but Klyton doesn’t ignore other fields such as medicine or education.\n\n\n\nThe city is still primarily made up of humans, but there has been a small creep in other races making their homes there as well over the years, for better or worse.\n\n\n\n\nThe surrounding area\n\n \nTo the north, the Cloudspeak Mountains form a natural barrier to any possible marauding barbarian tribes. While the mountains themselves are dangerous, it is rare for monsters to venture very far from them. Klyton worked out an agreement with the small dwarf community that lives there long ago for mining rights. A river originating from the Cloudspeak Mountains runs directly east of Klyton. The dwarves keep to themselves for the most part, but sometimes a few come to the city on business.\n\n\n\nTo the south is a mixture of forests and swamps and home to an on going battlefield. The elves and sotakan (A race of lizard like people) have been involved in an ongoing tribal war for at least as long Klyton has ever existed and probably even before that. Neither side ever gains the upper hand for very long and the cycle continues. Klytonians don’t exactly know what it’s all about, they just know they’re glad the savages have always kept their little fight confined to their area. Sometimes elves come to the city to trade, but they’re looked down upon as trouble makers and savages. No Sotakans have ever come to the city at all.\n\n\n\nThe closest human settlement is to the west, a rough port town on the ocean called Hessla. Despite having immediate access to the ocean (or perhaps because of it) it hasn’t grown to a large size like Klyton has. That might be due to several factors. Hesslans have a habit of engaging in piracy other criminal activities involving high levels of violence. There’s floods that occasionally hit the town. But even while teetering on the brink of total anarchy Hessla stays together mainly because a strong leader to prevent that from happening usually always runs it. (Weak Hessla leaders don’t last long) While they have extreme differences in society and some past bad blood, Klyton and Hessla have always maintained a good trading relationship. As far as both are concerned trading with each other is good business regardless of their personal feelings are.\n\n\n\nTo the east past the Cloudspeak River, exist long stretches of plains, scattered woods and the occasional small village. Past that is the Delantium Kingdom. The occasional merchant from there comes to trade and then leaves, though they usually also act as “emissaries” speaking of all the positive things about the Delantium Kingdom and saying how Klyton would be much better off if it joined it. While the Delantium Kingdom has never shown any signs that it would try to take Klyton by force, this sort of talk still makes most Klytons a little wary, as they value their independence and the thought of having to serve a “king” is not appealing at all.\n",
  "page 18": "He might have a point on some level, but you can’t just give up because some old miner gives his “sagely” advice.\n\n\n\nStill, you do have a bit of a dilemma on your hands; you need to think of a long-term way to raise profits. Actually at this point you need a short-term way to raise profits, because Mr. Reynolds will be coming in soon to collect and you doubt if you’re going to have an adequate amount to pay him. That’s going to result in a beating, which will result in your mom stepping in and selling the place.\n\n\n\nLacking any other solution you decide to water down the drinks, in the hopes that people will end up ordering more ale since it’ll take them longer to get drunk.\n\n\n\nThis solution doesn’t go over well.\n\n\n\nThat very night you’re already getting comments that the ale doesn’t taste quite as strong, and while this does result in the miners ordering more ale, the miners are used to drinking the Klyton alcohol they normally get and can instantly tell if something’s wrong with it.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the week, you’re getting loud verbal complaints about the ale, and outright accusations that it tastes like water. Several miners are insulted and leave the inn claiming that they’ve been loyal patrons here for so long and that they don’t need to be treated like this. You attempt to explain, but they shove you out of the way and tell you to go back to your fancy college.\n\n\n\n“I wish I could.” You quietly say to yourself.\n\n\n\nYou aren’t optimistic about the rest of the month. Sure there’s still adventurers and the odd wanderer, but not enough to turn a profit. It’ll be time to pay Mr. Reynolds soon and you’re going to fall short again.\n\n\n\nYour mother can’t bare to see you get hurt again and suggests forgetting all about the inn and just taking off with all the remaining money you have and going to live with your crazy aunt Enora.\n",
  "page 100": "Hans is probably right about Edmond, he’s going to keep you around indefinitely. If you help Hans he’ll most likely have his hands full trying to root out all the people still loyal to Edmond and solidifying his power base to worry about you.\n\n\n\nWhen you leave the hospital you enter the carriage, which is waiting for you across the street.\n\n\n\n“I trust you got everything you need?”\n\n“Yeah, I found something perfect to take care of our problem, but I need to warn you about it first.”\n\n“Oh? Well, out with it then.” Hans says.\n\n\n\nYou explain to Hans about the Incitahol and he seems intrigued.\n\n\n\n“So this stuff will kill him and then bring him back to life?”\n\n“In a manner of speaking. He’ll slowly lapse into a coma and then die. Then he’ll come back as a zombie and most likely a very lively and hostile one.”\n\n“Interesting. Okay. Good. That lizard will probably be by his side the whole time. When Edmond comes back he’ll probably try to attack his lizard who will defend himself and then the rest takes care of itself.”\n\n\n\nYou’re glad Hans sounds pleased with this plan, the only thing you have to do now is pull off the deception. Eventually you get back to the tavern where Reg and several other Talon members are waiting.\n\n\n\n“What the fuck took you so damn long? Edmond could’ve died already!”\n\n“Sorry.” You reply and head to his office.\n\n\n\nYou enter the office and the Sotakan assassin is holding a dagger to your throat already.\n\n\n\n“Down boy, it’s the doc...ugh…what the fuck took you so long? I’m dying over here!”\n\n\n\nThe Sotakan releases you and you run over to Edmond who is now lying on the floor still clutching his side.\n\n\n\n“I’m going to give you this shot first, it’ll help as an anti-biotic and to ease the pain. You might start getting sleepy though, do you someplace more comfortable to lay?”\n\n“Yeah, I guess the sofa.”\n\n\n\nYou Help Edmond to the sofa and give him the shot of Incitahol. You then begin sewing him up as quickly as possible. Normally you’d do a better job and extract the shrapnel in his body, but you figure he’s going to be dead soon anyway and you need to get out of here before he starts turning.\n\n\n\n“There you go. You should be good now, but you’ll need to rest and not move too much for a few days.”\n\n“(Yawn) Not a problem. I’ll probably just take care of business from here for the time being. As long I got my Sotakan whatchin’ my back, I’ll be fine. Damn, that shit kicks in really quick. I don’t feel anything….(Yawn) Glad you could help out doc…be sure to stick around…(Yawn) might have some work for you in the…zzzzzzzzzz…”\n\n\n\nYou stand away from Edmond, give a nod to the Sotakan and then leave quickly.\n\n\n\n“So is he asleep?” Edmond asks walking up to you.\n\n“Yeah, won’t be long…hey where’s that Reg guy?” you say noticing a difference in some of the personnel hanging around the bar now.\n\n“Don’t worry about him, you just take a seat at that table over there. If need anything just let Wallace know.”\n\n“But you know what’s going to happen and I’m not a fighter. I don’t think you’ll need me here.”\n\n“Don’t be so sure. Given what’s going to go down, we might still need a doctor soon. Besides having a doctor around in the future might be useful. Sit down, you’ll be fine.”\n\n\n\nYou get the impression you don’t have any choice in the matter, so you do what Hans says. You curse yourself for believing him. You have indeed traded one master for another.\n\n\n\n“Could I have a drink?” you ask Wallace, who looks less than pleased about you barking orders at him, but he gets you a bottle of strong whiskey before going to talk to his brother.\n\n\n\nTime passes and as you slowly get more drunk a loud noise is heard from Edmond’s office. It’s a mixture of hissing, moaning and loud crashing.\n\n\n\n“Hah! Sounds like he’s (hic!) up!” you slur while taking another drink. At this point Hans, Wallace and several other thugs rush into the office. You hear a bunch of yelling, fighting, and gunshots, but you just continue to drink the whole time.\n\n\n\n“Dis is yer fate mr. smart ass doctor, now you gotta (hic!) get yoost to it.” You say to your self while looking at the bottle.\n\n\n\n“Was it worth it?”\n\n\n\nAt this point Hans exits Edmond’s office looking a bit winded. He’s followed by Wallace and one of the other thugs that lived.\n\n\n\n“Shit, it’s a good thing that lizard had been preoccupied with Edmond. I can say with all honesty he put up a damn good fight even with a couple of bites in him.”\n\n“You chopped his head off I (hic!) hope!” you exclaim.\n\n“Yeah, of course I know the stories of the dead infection. Sheesh doc, I think you’ve had enough for the night.” Hans remarks.\n\n“I haven’t begun to drink!” you shout and then promptly pass out in the tavern.\n\n\n\nWhile this would be the first time you passed out in the Troll’s Breath Tavern, it wouldn’t be the last. After this night, your life takes a drastic turn.\n\n\n\nYour hospital career begins to take a slow but sure nosedive, though your “career” as a Crimson doc begins to pick up a lot. Hans has a lot more trouble establishing order over the Crimson Talons than he thought he would. You end up doing a lot of after hours surgery. To Hans’ credit he pays you well and you get free drinks whenever you can.\n\n\n\nEventually your mother knows something is going on with you, she isn’t sure what (and doesn’t really want to either), but she knows it isn’t good. Having no real reason to stay any longer, she finally sells the inn to the city and moves back to Teckleville. She mentions when you get your life together you can visit her, until that time, stay away.\n\n\n\nYou never see her again.\n\n\n\nFrom there your life becomes a downward spiral and your drinking increases to cope with your situation. As the years go on, the hospital can’t tolerate your sub par work due to a combination of drink and lack of proper sleep. Getting fired is bad enough, but you also lose your license and are lucky not to go to jail for malpractice.\n\n\n\nDoesn’t really matter to you at this point, you just embrace the whole criminal lifestyle and work for Hans full time. The only problem is, he’s getting sick of your sub-par work as well. Your situation becomes very much like the doctor who once worked Edmond.\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t really need to be said that your fate is very similar to his as well.\n\n\n\nOne night during a poker game you’re on a rare winning streak and drinking heavily as usual. Your obnoxious bragging gets on the nerves of several Crimson Talon members who have already been told on several occasions by Hans that your usefulness is soon coming to an end. They decide that tonight is the night.\n\n\n\nAs you try to stumble your way home in the dark, a crushing blow knocks you to the street followed by several sharp piecing to your body. Fortunately you’re so damn drunk that the pain is somewhat nonexistent. You mumble something incoherent and then pass out forever.\n\n\n\nYour winnings are taken back and your body sold to a bodylegger for spare parts. (Your liver is useless though)\n",
  "page 8": "You shake your head; you can’t walk away from this. Your mom might be in serious trouble because this loan. Selling the inn might not even be enough to cover it and even if it is, she probably won’t have enough to fall back on.\n\n\n\nYou aren’t angry with her, but you do feel a little anger towards your dad for getting her in this position (and you indirectly). You realize he still had the best intentions for you, but those don’t really help right now.\n\n\n\n“Alright first things first, who is the name of this loanshark?” you ask your mother.\n\n“Mr. Reynolds. He’ll be coming next week to pick up a collection. He’s not a member of the Crimson Talons, but he does have a couple of their goons working for him.”\n\n“The Crimson Talons? Oh geez, this just get better…okay how is this place doing for business?”\n\n“It’s doing about as well as it always has.”\n\n“That won’t be enough, we’ll need to get more people in here, or cut costs somehow.”\n\n“Well your father was going to have more work done on the rooms in the hopes that it would keep adventurers and maybe even merchants to come back whenever they travel through here. I’m not sure if it’s worth it though. Adventures don’t care where they sleep half the time and it’s not always a sure thing that they’re going to live long enough for repeat business. As for merchants, I think this place is a little too blue collar for them most of the time.”\n\n“You said something about getting a new liquor supplier?”\n\n“Yeah, the one here raised their prices, it would actually be cheaper to get the stuff shipped in from Hessla. Your father was supposed to meet with the new potential distributor in a couple days, so I’m not sure how that’s going to go through, if at all.”\n\n“How about the staff?”\n\n“The staff is working on minimum wage as it is, we’ve got three barmaids, Rita, Eliza and Wendy and they’re all disgruntled about their jobs, but they all still work well.. We can barely pay them though, and we might have to fire one of them.\n\n\n\nGrim stuff, but you’re determined to see this through. Since the liquor supplier from Hessla won’t arrive in two days you’re just going to focus on what you can do now.\n\n\n\nFixing the rooms is still a good idea to keep potential returning wandering adventurers happy. Spending a little money now could increase potential profits later. Who knows, maybe even a merchant will show up and spread the word that this place isn’t just some place where miners get drunk.\n\n\n\nFiring people sounds like it might save you money, but all it’s really going to do is create more work for the rest of you, so you decide to hold off on firing anyone for now.\n\n\n\nYour mother doesn’t agree with your idea of fixing the rooms, but seems relieved that you’re not firing anyone.\n\n\n\nThings go as normal at the inn. Several of the miners still offer their condolences about your father and are surprised to see that you’re taking up his mantle as it were, but other than that they don’t say to much to you. They probably don’t know what to say since while some of them might know you since you were little, but you’re not really “one of them” in terms of education level. Not to say they’re all a bunch of grunting idiots, but they probably figure you’re used to talking about things of a more cerebral nature. You don’t mind though, after all your main concern is getting your mom out of debt.\n\n\n\nTwo days pass and the supplier from Hessla arrives. He’s a grungy shady looking individual, but considering he’s from Hessla that’s hardly surprising.\n\n\n\nHe immediately says his name is Calwin asks for your father at which point you tell him he died recently. Calwin shows no sympathy and merely complains that he’s made a trip up here for no reason. You show a little restraint and call your mother to speak with him, but after five minutes with him she’s ready to throw him out the door for hitting on her, and you’re not exactly thrilled with him either at this point.\n\n\n\n“Look folks, if you want good quality alcohol at a low price I’m willing to deal wit ya, but I’m gonna need some incentive for my troubles because y’all seem like a buncha uptight prigs. Now I was invited here by the man who ran this establishment, so you called me here, if my help ain’t wanted, I’ll be on my way…” Calwin says.\n\n\n\nWhile you’re tempted to just have him leave, you decide it would be best to at least see if his stuff is any good.\n\n\n\n“Alright prove it. Surely you’ve brought some of your alcohol here so we can test to see if it’s any good.”\n\n“Well I do have some with me, but I can’t just be givin’ this stuff away for free.”\n\n“Don’t worry, you’ll be compensated.”\n\n\n\nYou call attention to the miners in the room and ask them if they’d like to try some new beer, naturally they’re all for it. A few of the miners take their fill of Calwin’s beer and they say that it’s different from what they usually drink, but it’s just as good.\n\n\n\nCalwin looks a little put off that they claimed his alcohol is “just as good”, but still maintains that it’s better than what you already have. He states his price, and also mentions that he wants a free room whenever he comes here since he’s apparently got a harpy of a wife at home and he likes to stay away for a couple days before having to go back to Hessla.\n\n\n\nYour mother obviously isn’t thrilled with having to deal with him, and in the short time he’s been here; he’s also hit on every one of the barmaids. Granted they’re used to such behavior, he’s particularly revolting. (Plus he’s from Hessla)\n",

You’ve been letting your school work slide lately and getting into trouble at school with those two little hoodlums you hang out with.”\n\n“They’re not hoodlums, and I didn’t get into trouble today!”\n\n“You aren’t supposed to be getting into trouble in the first place! Look son, I know you think I’m being hard on you, but this really is for your own good. Your little friends don’t have fathers that give shit about them, I should know because David’s dad is in here all the time and as for Tom, well the less said about his situation the better.”\n\n\n\nDoesn’t look like you’re getting out of here today, but you make one last attempt.\n\n\n\n“But I really don’t have that much homework, I really can do it quick over the weekend!”\n\n“Well if that is the case, you can help me out here instead.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“One of my barmaids is sick and I’m expecting a full house here tonight due to it being one of the miner’s birthdays today, so you can carry food and drinks.”\n\n\n\nYou certainly weren’t expecting that.\n\n\n\n“What? Can’t mom do it?”\n\n“Your mother is going to have her hands full attempting to cook the giant cloudspeak ram in the kitchen for the celebration, in fact you can start off by helping her chop up the beast.”\n\n\n\nAs usual your dad has given you no \"choice\" at all.\n",

I don’t feel anything….(Yawn) Glad you could help out doc…be sure to stick around…(Yawn) might have some work for you in the…zzzzzzzzzz…”\n\n\n\nYou stand away from Edmond, give a nod to the Sotakan and then leave quickly.\n\n\n\n“So is he asleep?” Edmond asks walking up to you.\n\n“Yeah, won’t be long…hey where’s that Reg guy?” you say noticing a difference in some of the personnel hanging around the bar now.\n\n“Don’t worry about him, you just take a seat at that table over there. If need anything just let Wallace know.”\n\n“Uh, I don’t think you really need me around any longer.”\n\n“Nonsense! Given what’s going to go down, we might still need a doctor soon. Besides having a doctor around in the future might be useful. Sit down, you’ll be fine.”\n\n\n\nYou get the impression you don’t have much choice in the matter so you do as Hans says. You try not to make your panic too noticeable, but you really scared about what’s going to happen. What happens if Hans finds out what you did? What if something gets out of hand and you suddenly got a bunch of zombies hungry for flesh? Normally you’d probably have a drink to calm your nerves, but you’re so worried about what might happen, you feel your only hope is to have all your wits about you.\n\n\n\nEventually Wallace gets sick of watching you and goes to talk with his brother who is currently sitting at a table with a group of other thugs telling them how they need to attack the Sotakan assassin as quickly as possible when they rush the room. You think about making a break for it, but you’d never make it.\n\n\n\nTime passes and eventually noise is heard from Edmond’s office. It’s a mixture of hissing, moaning and loud crashing.\n\n\n\n“What the fuck?” Hans says pulling out his flintlock and then looks over in your direction, you shrug your shoulders replying “I dunno.”\n\n“Come on, let’s just do it!” Wallace says picking up a nearby blunderbuss.\n\n\n\nAt this point Wallace and the rest of the thugs rush into Edmond’s office. Hans stays outside watching you and the both of you hear a bunch of yelling, fighting, and gunshots. Then there’s silence.\n\n\n\n“Wallace?” Hans calls out while heading towards the office.\n\n“…ugh…yeah…I’m hurt…get the doc…” Wallace’s voice calls back.\n\n\n\n“Come on, get yer ass over here, my brother’s hurt!” Wallace says. You gulp nervously and slowly make your way to Wallace\n\n\n\n“Shit, it looks like a fucking slaughterhouse in here.” Hans remarks as you both enter the room.\n\n\n\nHans is quite correct, the office is splattered with blood and gore with several dead bodies everywhere. Edmond, the Sotakan, and the Crimson thugs they’re all dead. You notice Edmond has a head wound, the Sotakan does too, you can’t tell with some of the other though until…\n\n\n\n“OH SHIT! WALLACE!” Hans shouts as two of those bodies suddenly sit up and attack!\n\n\n\nHans shoots one of them in the chest, dropping it to the floor temporarily, but the other one begins munching on Wallace. His screams are enough to finally cause you to run.\n\n\n\n“HEY YOU COWARDLY FUCK, HELP ME! AGH! MY FOOT!” Hans yells as you try to open the tavern door. Unfortunately Hans wasn’t taking any chances of you attempting to escape and the door is firmly locked.\n\n\n\nIn desperation you grab a nearby chair to bust out a small window you might be able to squeeze through. You attempts are cut short when one of the zombies tackles you to the floor and take a bite out of your arm. You cries of pain are cut short when the next bite rips out your throat.\n\n\n\nYour death is just one of the first in the zombie plague you thoughtlessly unleashed on Klyton.\n",
  "page 2": " \n\n“You’re selling the inn?!”\n\n“I have to! I can’t run this place myself.”\n\n“Well that’s what you have staff for!”\n\n“Oh son…(sniff) I don’t think you know the entire situation. You haven’t been around as much over the years.”\n\n“Mom, I always meant to visit more, but…”\n\n“No, it’s not that. In fact I’m glad you had fun at college. You at least had some enjoyment. I’m just sorry you won’t get to have any more.”\n\n“Mom, I don’t like where this is going.”\n\n\n\nYou mom at this point begins cry again until you eventually get her to calm down. What comes next almost makes you cry though.\n\n\n\nWhile your father did indeed save for you, it wasn’t enough to put you through college completely. Costs were higher than he thought and even though business was okay, he had unexpected expenses such as making fixes to the inn and price hikes in his alcohol supplier.\n\n\n\nYour father was determined to not pull you out of college though, so he found another way. He borrowed money from a moneylender.\n\n\n\n“WHAT?! Why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve taken less classes or gotten a part time job at the university!”\n\n“No, he didn’t want you to worry or get distracted.”\n\n“Well I guess that’s good since all that worry can go to this now! By the gods, why didn’t he at least go to a bank to get the loan!?”\n\n“He tried, but didn’t get approved. They wouldn’t even take the inn as collateral. I pleaded with him not to borrow money from criminals, but he claimed it would be fine as long as he opened the tavern earlier, found a cheaper supplier and made a few cuts here and there. And for a while things were running a little smoother, but I could see the stress taking a toll on him. It’s what ultimately killed him. I’m just so sorry that we failed you. We wanted so much better for you. Now I’ll have to sell the inn off to pay off the moneylender and hopefully I’ll be able to find a job as a cook elsewhere.”\n\n\n\nYou just sit in silence and try to wrap your head around all of this. Your bright future in medicine as you know is gone. You still have quite a bit of education, and you’re fairly certain you could still find a job to support yourself, but it’s going to be hard initially and you probably won’t be satisfied with it. You’re also worried about your mom, what if she can’t find a job? You won’t be able to help her much.\n\n\n\nYou can only think of one solution.\n\n\n\n“Would it help if I ran the inn?” you ask.\n\n“What?” your mother replies.\n\n“Would it help if I helped you run this place. I mean granted I don’t have excessive experience, I have watched you guys do it while I grew up here. I think I can manage the basics. If we managed to keep this place running at least long enough to pay off the loan, maybe then I can save enough to finish my education.”\n\n“I don’t know son, I mean…I would love to see you finish your education, but it’s a lot to take on. Would you have time? I don’t want you getting burned out and suffering a pre-mature heart attack like your father because of the stress!”\n\n“Well, I’m going to have nothing but time now, if I drop out and focus on this place. I think the main concern is getting us out of debt…just how much do you owe?”\n\n“Uh…about ten thousand gold coins.”\n\n\n\nYou really hoped it would be significantly less than that.\n\n\n\n“Okay, well I’m guessing he takes smaller payments to buy you time but then charges more interest with each passage of time. We’ll have to get this place whipped into shape so it’s making enough profit that we’ll be able to pay the entire sum as soon as possible. After that, we’ll have some breathing room.”\n\n\n\nYour mom looks apprehensive about all this and then shakes her head claiming she can’t let you shoulder this responsibility especially with the risk of physical danger involved if you anger the moneylender in some way.\n\n\n\nShe says that you should go on with your life and forget about the inn, she’ll be able to sell it and pay off the debt with no problem. And as for her, she also tells you not to worry about her either, but she hopes that you’ll forgive her and your father for failing in giving you the life you deserve.\n\n\n\nIt is true you could walk away from all this. You don’t really have any great desire to run the inn. It was just a solution you came up with to help your mom and possibly help yourself. But there’s no guarantee it’s going to work, just like there’s no guarantee that you can’t still achieve your goals on your own.\n",
  "page 1": "Well, you’d rather not do any real work and lying and sneaking out is probably just going to get you into more trouble.\n\n\n\n“Alright, I’ll do my homework!” you say.\n\n“Good choice son. Make sure you lock the door to the private quarters as usual.”\n\n\n\nYou head upstairs to the third floor where your family has their own living space and lock the door.\n\n\n\nYou get started on your homework to get it out of the way so you’ll at least have the weekend to enjoy. As you go through it, it’s a little more difficult than you thought it would be and it was probably good that you have given yourself a lot of time to work on it.\n\n\n\nA few hours pass and you’re finally finished. Your dad might be right; if you’d paid more attention in class your homework wouldn’t have taken as long. It’s too late now to go out and play even if you were allowed, but that still doesn’t mean you have to do anymore studying tonight.\n\n\n\nYou spend the rest of the night playing with some of your toy soldiers and reading a few of your copper dreadfuls. You sometimes can hear some of the louder drunk miners using a bunch of curse words in an amusing way. Eventually you fall asleep.\n\n\n\nThe next day you wake up early, your parents are still asleep so you grab some cookies before you go out to play. You run into Quincy on the way to David’s house.\n\n\n\n“Hey, where were you yesterday? You missed all the excitement!” Quincy says.\n\n“Yeah, I had to go my homework. Damn, I knew I was going to miss a good game of smash ball!”\n\n“No, not that! David and Tom got arrested!”\n\n“What!?”\n\n“Yeah! After we played a few games, we all went to the sweet shop. Well David and Tom tried to steal some of the candy and when Mr. Blek saw them, they ran off with it! They didn’t get far though. From what I know they spent the night in Juvie Hall!”\n\n\n\nThis is surreal to you. Your dad was right again. You wonder if you would’ve went along with them and gotten in trouble as well if you’d snuck out yesterday. You can always say now that you wouldn’t have, but who knows at that moment?\n\n\n\nOne thing is for sure; you’re not going to hang out with those two on a regular basis anymore.\n\n\n\nYears pass…\n\n\n\nThe day is finally here and you’re heading off to Klyton University. All your hard work has finally paid off and your parents couldn’t be happier.\n\n\n\n“Now remember, I’ve been saving for your tuition since you were born, but remember why you’re there. To learn! I don’t want you getting caught up in wild parties and failing your classes. Maybe the upper class kids with super rich parents can afford to, but you can’t.”\n\n“I know dad.”\n\n“Oh, don’t mind your father, have some fun when you can. We know you’ll do the right thing.”\n\n\n\nFor the most part you do, accomplish the right things in your days at Klyton University. You study, you make contacts, you make friends, and in your free time you have fun.\n\n\n\nYou initially thought you might be “looked down on” due to your working class background. While there are a few like you here, a university education is still expensive and generally only the rich can afford to send their children there. Still, you managed to get here, you (and your family) must have earned it, and so you’re treated with respect.\n\n\n\nYour years at Klyton University are busy but happy ones. You can only imagine that when you just started you pre-med courses that more of the same would’ve come about, however that’s not to be…\n\n\n\nYou’re in your dorm when you get the message from a courier.\n\n\n\nYour father has died of a heart attack. Happened suddenly last night while he was working and by the time a physician arrived nothing could be done to save him. You sit down in shock for a brief moment and when you finally gather your strength, you catch the next coach to the Miner’s Mug Inn.\n\n\n\nWhen you arrive the Inn is closed, so you let yourself in to find your mother who is unsurprisingly upset. You console her as best you can for the time being and help make the funeral arrangements.\n\n\n\nYour father didn’t want an expensive funeral, so it’s a small one. The Inn’s staff is invited along with a few of the miners that were genuinely friends with your dad. Everyone pays their respects before dear old dad is put into the ground.\n\n\n\nOn your way home with your mother, you suddenly realize you’ve missed a couple classes during all this. You then start to wonder about your future college plans and while it’s still a fragile time for your mother, you need to ask her about it when you get home.\n\n\n\nYou don’t know it yet, but you’re in for more shocking news…\n",
  "page 104": "Things don’t get accomplished by sitting around doing nothing. You have to seize the day! You stand up from your seat and call out to her.\n\n\n\n“Eliza!”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“I like you! Do you like me?”\n\n\n\nNot exactly the most mature way of “seizing the day” but fortunately for you Eliza is easily amused and she isn’t without her own feelings towards you.\n\n\n\nAfter a few moments of talking the pair of you both realize you can’t really do anything major with this relationship now, but after all this spying business is over with you’ll be able to.\n\n\n\nExcept that doesn’t really happen and the pair of you are meeting a lot more frequently.\n\n\n\nA month passes and Wendy begins to grumble about being short staffed and wonder when the hell Eliza is coming back.\n\n\n\n“Eliza’s doing important work and I’m sick of hearing criticism about her, so just suck it up and work harder.” You tell Wendy\n\n“Are you fucking kidding me? I work like a fucking Dwarven Shieldmaiden around here!” Wendy exclaims. “It’s not like Rita does any damn work except sit around and look pretty, and as for those two halfbreed sluts I have to practically light a fire under their asses in order to get them to do anything. Eliza was the only one who I could reliably count on and now I don’t even have her because she’s fucking you!”\n\n“HEY! Watch who the hell you’re talking to!”\n\n“Or what? It’s true isn’t it? Don’t think I haven’t noticed the increase in your little meetings with her. Far be it from me to get in the way of young love and all that, but it’s starting to interfere with MY life. Tell me has she even found anything to incriminate Frank yet?”\n\n“Well no, but she says there’s still a lot of suspicious stuff going on. She says she thinks she might be on to something soon.”\n\nWendy just shakes her head. “I told you we should’ve just gone with my plan. I’m telling you right now though, I’m not going to put up with being overworked too much longer, so if you expect me to stick around, you better stop playing so much grab ass with her so she can concentrate on her real job.”\n\n\n\nWhile Wendy’s words give you something to consider, they’re a little too late. A few days later while you’re going to one of your classes you run into Frank of all people on campus.\n\n\n\n“So, this is what college is like eh? I believe I probably would’ve liked going to this institution. Having more knowledge is always a good thing.”\n\n“Frank…what are you doing here?”\n\n“Ah, what I’m doing here, let’s walk and talk, wouldn’t want you to be late for class and all.”\n\n\n\nYou slowly walk with Frank while having a sickening feeling about this whole surprise visit.\n\n\n\n“Okay m’boy let’s get right to it since you’re obviously about to vomit. I know all about Eliza, quite honestly I don’t know why I didn’t pick up on her reasons for being there in the first place. Stupidness on my part, I suppose I was blinded by the idea that my inn was finally starting to gain more customers again…but this isn’t about my stupidity, it’s about yours.”\n\n\n\nYou stop for a moment as you begin to feel sick to the point that you’re dry heaving.\n\n\n\n“Oh for…alright I better tell you the good news first before you make a damn scene. Eliza is fine…for now. Anyway let me get to the point. Your inn is mine now.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Well your mother’s inn then, or whoever owns it. I’m not unreasonable so I will buy it for a fair price.”\n\n“Wait, you just want me to hand over the inn to you?”\n\n“No, I said I was offering to buy it…that is unless you don’t really care about your precious Eliza after all.”\n\n\n\nAt this point you get angry and grab Frank by the collar with both hands, causing several passersby to avoid the pair of you. Frank isn’t at all intimidated though.\n\n\n\n“Attempting to beat the hell out of me isn’t going to improve your situation m’boy. Look you need to just accept the fact that you’ve lost. It’s obvious you have feelings for Eliza, so the logical thing to do is to sell your inn.”\n\n“I have friends in the Klyton militia, I could just have them storm your place!”\n\n“You could I suppose, but not in time to save Eliza, not to mention that plan might not work out like you think. I have friends of my own too, much more powerful than the Klyton militia.” Frank’s expression is quite serious at this point.\n\n\n\nLacking any other ideas, you feebly attempt to bluff.\n\n\n\n“…well maybe…Eliza will have to be sacrificed for the good of the inn…or…”\n\n“Wow, I’m surprised you actually managed to say it, even if you don’t mean it. Even if you were serious, I doubt that even you would want to sacrifice your own child within her.”\n\n\n\nThe shock of this revelation leaves you speechless.\n\n\n\n“Hmm, didn’t tell you then? She’s not far along and obviously not showing yet but trust me I know. It’s one of the reasons why you’re getting this special generous deal. I’m not exactly heartless even though you probably think I’m being a complete bastard right now. Well I suppose I’ll leave you to it, I imagine you’ll need lots of time to get your stuff in order.”\n\n\n\nYou heart sinks, there’s no way out of this. You’ll have to tell your mother everything and this is definitely going to put an end to your college pursuits for a long time.\n\n\n\nThe transfer isn’t complicated. Your mother isn’t exactly happy about how you bungled all this, but she isn’t willing to sacrifice her future grandchild. Not to mention she was only continuing to help with the inn due to your college fees. She’s been tired of living in Klyton ever since your father died.\n\n\n\nWhen you and your mother meet Frank at his inn, he has a couple of his waitresses to get Eliza. She looks none the worse for wear. Frank assures you that apart from keeping her locked up in one of his rooms nothing was done to her.\n\n\n\nIn the following months you eventually marry Eliza and get a job as a lowly clerk filing away insignificant papers and other dull material. You move into a modest apartment and manage to get settled in fairly well due to the money your mother got from selling the inn. She gave most of it to you since she moved to Teckleville to live with her sister Enora.\n\n\n\nIn the months that follow, Eliza finally gives birth to your daughter. You find yourself working a lot and while you aren’t completely unhappy, you begin to feel a sense of dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\nIn the years that follow you’re beginning to feel burned out, you wonder if moving to Teckleville wouldn’t be a good idea, but Eliza says that you wouldn’t be find work there, or at least not the kind that pays well enough to support all of you. You and her begin to argue a lot, mostly over money and how you never seem to have enough of it.\n\n\n\nAnother decade and you’re practically miserable. You’re working at a job that you hate, you live with a wife that you’ve fallen out of love with and you now have two children that are barely obedient.\n\n\n\nIt’s probably just as well that you suddenly suffer from a heart attack due to all the stress. Any longer and you probably would’ve snapped and went on a killing spree.\n\n\n\nIn your last moments you wonder back to your days at the inn and if you could’ve avoided all this had you done things differently there.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 4": " \n\nAnother day home from school…\n\n\n\n“I’m telling you Ms. Zelamoyer is a witch, there’s no way she could know what we did unless she read our minds!” David says.\n\n“Yeah maybe she’s even a demon in human disguise!” Tom adds\n\n“Or maybe you two looked guilty as hell and laughed the loudest when she sat on the thumbtacks you put in her seat.” You say. “I told you guys that was a bad idea. I’m surprised she only paddled you and didn’t have you kicked out of the school permanently.”\n\n“Yeah well it didn’t even hurt. My dad beats me harder than that. Though I guess Tom thought it hurt with the way he cried! Hahahaha!” David taunts.\n\n“Shut up David!” Tom exclaims.\n\n“So are you playing Smash Sphere over in the park today?” David asks you.\n\n“I hope so, but my dad’s been on my case about me studying harder. Says he wants me to make something of myself when I grow up.”\n\n“That sucks. My dad is always either at the mines or drinking at your dad’s place. The only time I have to worry about him is when my mom tells him about something I did, then I get a beating. I don’t think I’d survive it if he was always around.” David replies.\n\n“My mom doesn’t beat me, but she’ll yell and throw me into a small dark closet without food if I do something bad.” Tom says.\n\n“Your mom is one scary ass dyke, Tom. My dad said he saw her scare away a mountain troll in the mines once.”\n\n“Shut up David! My mom’s not a dyke!”\n\n“Yes she is! What about that other lady that lives with you then?”\n\n“That’s just mom’s roommate! She needs a place to stay so she helps around the house, like cook dinner or clean up. Mom is at the mines all day, so she can’t do that stuff, so it works out. She’s kind of like a live in maid!”\n\n“Sounds more like a second mom…”\n\n\n\nAs much as you enjoy Tom’s naïve defense of his lesbian mother and David’s taunting of it, you arrive at the Inn where you say goodbye to your friends and tell them you might see them later.\n\n\n\nAs soon as you get in, you dad calls you over to the bar.\n\n\n\n“So do you have any homework?” he asks.\n\n“Yeah, but it’s not due until next week.”\n\n“Hmm, well if it’s not due until next week it must need a lot of attention, better get started on it.”\n\n“It’s really not that much dad, I can do it over the weekend. I’m going to go out and play smash sphere with David and Tom.”\n\n“Is that what you think? Better cancel that idea. You’re hitting the books, besides I vaguely remember you mentioning you were also going to have test next week too.”\n\n“But dad!”\n\n“Don’t dad me! You’ve been letting your school work slide lately and getting into trouble at school with those two little hoodlums you hang out with.”\n\n“They’re not hoodlums, and I didn’t get into trouble today!”\n\n“You aren’t supposed to be getting into trouble in the first place! Look son, I know you think I’m being hard on you, but this really is for your own good. Your little friends don’t have fathers that give shit about them, I should know because David’s dad is in here all the time and as for Tom, well the less said about his situation the better.”\n\n\n\nDoesn’t look like you’re getting out of here today, but you make one last attempt.\n\n\n\n“But I really don’t have that much homework, I really can do it quick over the weekend!”\n\n“Well if that is the case, you can help me out here instead.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“One of my barmaids is sick and I’m expecting a full house here tonight due to it being one of the miner’s birthdays today, so you can carry food and drinks.”\n\n\n\nYou certainly weren’t expecting that.\n\n\n\n“What? Can’t mom do it?”\n\n“Your mother is going to have her hands full attempting to cook the giant cloudspeak ram in the kitchen for the celebration, in fact you can start off by helping her chop up the beast.”\n\n\n\nAs usual your dad has given you no \"choice\" at all.\n",
  "page 107": "A few years have passed and your medical schooling is complete and you now work at the Klyton hospital as a real doctor.\n\n\n\nYour personal life has changed quite a bit over the past few years as well. You currently live in an apartment near the hospital with a fellow medical student. Actually she’s your girlfriend. It started out as a simple roommates thing, but then it developed into something a little more. Cindy still has a year of schooling to go, and you now have a job at the hospital so you weren’t planning on going anywhere just yet.\n\n\n\nHowever Cindy suggests that the pair of you should leave for the Delantium Kingdom, specifically Sivak, which is the closest big city. She mentions that there are more opportunities there and she would prefer living there as well.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have any specific objections against going there, it’s just you’ve never left Klyton, so you’re probably a little nervous especially since you’ve managed to succeed in getting a good job here and maintain a friendly relationship with most of the people you work beside.\n\n\n\nWell you have a year to hammer out all the plans in the meantime you’re on your way to visit your mother. You don’t see her as much as you used to but she is of course very proud of you and mentions that your father would be too if he were still alive. After all it was always his goal to make sure that you went into medicine for a career.\n\n\n\nWhen you get to the Traveler’s Inn, it never ceases to amaze you how much the place has changed and how much it has grown since the days when you were little. Wendy does most of the day to day inn management nowadays, leaving your mom to concentrate on the cooking, which she prefers in the first place. Rita still works there surprisingly enough. Apparently she found it a lot better to just hook up with various rich guys for a short period of time to get some gifts and then remain single.\n\n\n\nEliza is the new head barmaid. You guess that experience with the whole Griffon Inn situation boosted her confidence. She even managed to turn Flameflower and Sunshine into productive employees! You remember how friendly you were to each other and how sometimes it seemed like there was the potential for more there, but neither one of you seriously pursued it.\n\n\n\n“Well, haven’t seen you in awhile Mr. big shot doctor. You still with that…girl?” Rita asks when you walk in.\n\n“Her name’s Cindy and yes I am, Rita. What’s it to you anyway?”\n\n“Nothing, can’t I be concerned for your well being? I mean we have known each other for a long time and all.”\n\n“Hm. Well I’m fine. Where’s my mom?”\n\n“She’s in the kitchen as usual.”\n\n\n\nYou walk past Rita, shaking your head at her sudden interest in you now that you have a good paying job. As you approach the bar, Wendy notices you.\n\n\n\n“I see the great doctor has come for a visit. Taking a break from that girl you shacked up with huh? Anyway your mom is in the kitchen.” She says and then goes back to talking with some of the patrons.\n\n\n\nWhen you enter the kitchen your mom turns around to see you and smiles before rushing to give you a big hug.\n\n\n\n“Aw mom.” You say not wanting all this fuss.\n\n“Hey indulge me, I don’t get to see you as much as I used to. So how have you been? What’s going on? Are you still with…that girl?”\n\n“Her name’s Cindy, geez why doesn’t anyone like her? Rita and Wendy both made some snide remark about her as I came walking in.”\n\n“Sorry son, I’m sure Cindy’s a nice girl and all, but the couple times you visited here with her, she was a bit pretentious, and you know Wendy doesn’t care for people like that. As for Rita, well I’m sure you know why she’s acts the way she does by now.”\n\n“ Okay I know Cindy has a bit of that upper class personality, but Eliza was the only one who even tried to be friendly with Cindy the last time she was here!”\n\n“Eliza would be friendly to a mountain troll as long as it wasn’t eating her. It’s just her nature. Not to mention she thinks you’re happy with Cindy so she’s happy for you.”\n\n“So, why can’t you be happy for me?”\n\n“Who said I wasn’t? If that’s who you want then good! I’m all for it. The question though is are you happy?”\n\n“Of course I am! I wouldn’t be moving with her to Sivak by next year if I wasn’t! That’s sort of why I came here today. I wanted to let you know, I’ll be leaving Klyton soon.”\n\n\n\nYou mother doesn’t seem too emotional about this revelation, you were sort of expecting more tears or celebration. Instead she just sighs and heads off to cut some vegetables, before speaking again.\n\n\n\n“Hmm, okay. Well as long as you’re sure that’s what you want to do.”\n\n“Why wouldn’t it? I mean there are more opportunities in Sivak than there are here for me and Cindy. You didn’t want me to stay did you? I thought you were going to sell this place and move to Teckleville anyway.”\n\n“No, of course I don’t want you to stay for me! Geez, I can manage just fine. Your father and I always knew the day would come that you’d move far away. As for selling this place, eh, I’m not sure yet. It is true that after your father died, my main motivation was to keep this place running to help continue paying for your education. I figured after that goal was reached I would indeed retire to Teckleville. I dunno now though. I guess after all the stuff we went through to keep this place, not to mention making it better, I’ve become more attached to it again.”\n\n\n\nNow you’re sort of surprised to hear her say that, you thought for sure that she was fully intending on moving back to Teckleville.\n\n\n\n“Well, no matter where you are, I hope you know I’ll visit.” You say.\n\n“Oh of course, I wasn’t worried about that. Well anyway I have to finish preparing this drakling. Some adventurers can’t ever order something simple, well at least they brought it in themselves I suppose.”\n\n\n\nAt this point you and your mother say goodbye to each other and you walk out of the kitchen. On your way out you bump into Eliza.\n\n\n\n“Hey you! I haven’t seen you in a long time! How have you been? Are things going well for you and Cindy?”\n\nYou smile at the fact that she remembered your girlfriend’s name. “I’ve been okay. I heard about you being the head waitress now, congratulation.”\n\n“Thanks, I’m actually running a little late right now. I’ll have to talk with you later, maybe we should meet sometime when we’re not both busy.”\n\n“Um…yeah maybe. Well see you later.” You say and quickly leave the area.\n\n\n\nAs you leave you feel a mixture of guilt, anxiety and confusion. Part of you wants to go back. You don’t know if you have real feelings for Eliza or you’re just deliberately thinking about sabotaging things so you don’t have to move away from Klyton.\n",
  "page 106": "Whatever feelings either of you might have need to be put aside and left alone at least until she’s done with this mission. She needs to focus.\n\n\n\nA month passes and Wendy begins to grumble about being short staffed and wonder when the hell Eliza is coming back.\n\n\n\n“Eliza’s doing important work, just hang in there. She’ll be back here on a regular basis soon.”\n\n“Well she better. Dunno why you went with her plan anyway, it would’ve been easier to go with mine.” Wendy says.\n\n“Maybe, but I wanted to have some extra leverage on Frank if we’re going to report him to our militia friends.”\n\n\n\nYour gamble pays off, a few days later. Eliza comes running into the inn with something bundled under one of her arms and looking more than a little nervous. She says she needs to talk to you immediately and how important it is. You comply and head to the kitchen where your mother is, since she probably needs to know whatever Eliza has to say as well.\n\n\n\n“Demons…Frank’s in league with demons!” Eliza blurts out.\n\n“What? Are you sure?” you ask.\n\n“Yes! I was in his wine cellar getting a special bottle for one of his wealthy merchant customers when a rat passed by and startled me. This caused me to jump back and I hit the wall, but in doing so I must’ve hit some sort of secret button because the wall opened up into a small room. There was blood on the floor, a few bones, and a bunch of symbols drawn everywhere. The thing that stood out though was this!”\n\n\n\nEliza drops the bundle on the kitchen table and unwraps the cloth she’s put it in to reveal a large leather bound book with a few symbols written on it. If it isn’t a spell book, it sure looks like one.\n\n\n\n“Well I suppose we now know Frank’s an unlicensed mage, but are you sure about the demons?” Your mother asks.\n\n“Yes! I’ve seen them! I mean everyone has, they just don’t know!” Eliza exclaims. “When I was leaving with the book and closing the secret door, two of the waitresses I work with confronted me. When they showed me their true forms, I was scared for my life. These two in particular had always made me a little nervous. They just had an odd aura about them, never imagined that they were demons though.”\n\n“They didn’t try to do anything to you?”\n\n“No, they just said that I was very lucky Frank neglected to be thorough when drawing up his contract with them. I think they saw me as a potential loophole out of their service to him. I know they never really seemed fond of Frank.”\n\n“Well whatever the reason, I’m glad you’re safe. I suppose now we should go inform the Klyton militia.” You say.\n\n\n\nAfter bringing the book to Klyton sergeant and Eliza repeating her story to them, they take action immediately. Unlicensed magery is a very series offense, let alone cavorting with demons.\n\n\n\nNaturally you don’t witness the raid; in fact the Klyton militia tries its best to section off the area beforehand, but given that Frank’s place is in a high traffic area and is already pretty popular, it’s not an entirely successful endeavor. A group of heavily armed Klyton militia with sanctioned wizards as support tends to draw attention. Fortunately it doesn’t end in a big explosion and hundreds dead. It ends with a few smaller explosions and only a couple dozen dead instead. Unfortunately it also ends with the one of the demons escaping as well. For a while there’s a lock down on the entire city as the Klyton militia tries to maintain order as well as searching for the thing, eventually nothing comes of it and it is assumed that the succubus flew away to a place where it could hunt for new prey a lot easier. (Probably Hessla).\n\n\n\nDuring this time, the inn was pretty busy since several merchants couldn’t leave the city right away, not to mention some of the regulars drinking a little more to calm themselves of a possible demon running around, so it works out for you pretty well.\n\n\n\nAfter everything is said and done, you have enough money to continue your education and with this financial pressure off, you easily pass the rest of your classes with no worries.\n\n\n\nOf course now you’re in your final stages of your education, which means medical school as well as actually having to get a job actually working at a hospital. The only problem with that is being an intern doesn’t pay all that well and you certainly can’t do that AND work at the bar. Your mother reassures you that you shouldn’t worry about it as she’ll be able to hire a couple extra people as well as being able to help with the rest of your tuition.\n\n\n\nIn any case it looks like your days as an innkeeper are over.\n",
  "page 11": "Mom: Owner/Cook\n\n\n\nMom is still trying to get over dad’s death. At this point she’d rather sell the place and move back to Teckleville where her sister Enora lives.\n\n\n\nRita: Barmaid\n\n\n\nRita’s about your age and started working at the inn a few years before you went off to the university. You remember thinking she was hot when you first saw her and you tried to speak to her a few times to test the waters so to speak, but it was pretty obvious that she didn’t have any sort of interest in you since were more of a bookworm. A bookworm without much money. Not a good combination for getting her affection.\n\n\n\nWendy: Barmaid\n\n\n\nWendy’s been working here since you were in primary school. She’s unofficially the “head barmaid” but the inn has never had that big of a staff to assign fancy titles. Still, she’s the one that gets the others moving faster if it calls for it. As for you, she’s never really paid any major attention mainly because she’s got kids of her own she has to deal with and you never had any reason to talk to her on any meaningful level. She probably was just relieved that you weren’t some “bratty boss’ kid” that she had to put up with along with being a minimum wage slave.\n\n\n\nEliza: Barmaid\n\n\n\nEliza’s a little younger than you. In fact you were already at Klyton University when she started working at the inn. In the past during your visits to the inn, she seemed to be nice to you, but you don’t know much about other than she’s a pretty girl and on the shy side.\n",
  "page 55": "You don’t think you could stop him if you tried, but you do try to minimize the damage by insisting on going with him and trying to talk to your professor first. You suggest going tomorrow night when you know she’ll be working late in her lab and there won’t be a lot of other people around.\n\n\n\n“Alright, but whether or not you manage to talk any sense into this bitch, she’s getting her monster tomorrow and forking over the rest of our pay!”\n\n\n\nThe trip to the university is an awkward coach ride. The daquala is growling loud enough for people to know Benjamin is carrying something alive in the covered cage, but fortunately you get to Dr. Gossey’s lab without incident. She of course is surprised to see the three of you.\n\n\n\n“Uh hello, I wasn’t expecting to see you three… wait did you bring the daquala with you?!”\n\n“Damn straight! We’ve completed your task for you and then some! Time for you to take this fucking thing and pay us the rest of our money!” Hanon yells.\n\n“I’ll do no such thing, I haven’t managed to clear things up with the dean yet and I still have some…look I don’t have time for this, you tell them!” Dr. Gossey says to you in an exasperated tone.\n\n“Uh, I don’t think that’s going to help professor. Look surely there’s a good strong container to hold this thing in here at the university and I’m pretty sure it can just be fed any sort of meat. Can’t it be held here for now? Just keep it here in your private lab until you clear things up.”\n\n“NO! If anyone found out I’d be ruined! I’ve risked everything to get the beast, and I won’t lose it all by keeping it on campus because of stupid rules! Now get it out of here now!”\n\n\n\nYou’ve never known professor Gossey to be so irrational, but she’s going into overkill with this daquala business. You don’t really understand why she can’t keep it here. It would probably be better anyway since she could study it while she tries to do whatever “red tape clearing” she says she needs to do.\n\n\n\n“Alright fuck this stupid shit, Ben drop the cage over there, we’re getting out of here…but we’re also getting our money. I suggest you pay up, before things get ugly.” Hanon warns.\n\n“I’m not paying you anything else! I told you when the job is done I will and not before! What? What will you do, kill me? You’d never get away with it and I assure you I am not as defenseless as you might think! And as for YOU, if you don’t stop siding with these glorified mercs you won’t only not get the rest of your money, but you also won’t be passing your class!”\n\n\n\nAfter a couple more threats back and forth, and you trying to make peace between your professor and the adventurers, Hanon pulls out one of his pistols, Benjamin draws his axe and Dr. Gossey runs to a panel nearby which slams a adamantium shutter on the lab door sealing everyone in, she then produces a vial with a stopper on top.\n\n\n\n“Hold it right there! One more move and I fill this place with the black pox plague!”\n\n“Oh fuck! Come on everyone stop fighting!” you say backing away from everyone and looking for someway of getting out of the lab.\n\n“Yeah right! Like you’d infect yourself!”\n\n“Fool! Don’t you think I’ve take the antidote already?”\n\n“Bitch we just spent a month in the Sotakan swamps getting bit, stung and exposed to several diseases they probably don’t even have names for yet. I’m pretty sure my magic can cure black pox!”\n\n“Well let’s find out then!” Dr. Gossey says and shatters the vial to the floor!\n\n\n\nYou can only look on in horror and sink to the floor in hopelessness. You don’t even pay attention to the events that happen next.\n\n\n\nBenjamin chases Dr. Gossey around the lab with his axe and while he’s doing that, Hanon casts some sort of spell. Of course with Hanon no longer bothering with up keeping the spell wards on the cage, the daquala manages to finally bust out of its imprisonment due to ravenous hunger.\n\n\n\nThe daquala leaps on Hanon and tears into his neck releasing an arterial spray all over the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n“NO!” Benjamin bellows and charges at the darquala who jumps away from eating Hanon’s body and camouflages itself. It doesn’t help it much though, the lab isn’t like the dark expansive swamp and Ben is a big man with a big axe, he just starts chopping at everything and sure enough he eventually manages to graze the creature.\n\n\n\nThe daquala and Benjamin engage in a short battle, but ultimately Ben proves to be stronger and better armored. He manages to grab it in mid leap, throws it to the floor, stomps on its body with one of his heavy boots and finally brings his axe down on its head, killing it for good.\n\n\n\n“Fuck, I told you bastards to just wait a little while! Now look what you’ve done! Eat lead asshole!” Dr. Gossey yells and shoots Benjamin in the head twice. He teeters a moment and then falls in a heap near the darquala.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile you’re still rocking back and forth and babbling about how all you wanted to be was a doctor and how you’re going to die.\n\n\n\n“If you’re worried about black pox, you needn’t be, there wasn’t anything in the damn vial. I’m not crazy enough to release a plague. Now I’m sure Hanon and Ben coming here was probably out of your hands and you were just trying to play diplomat, but I suggest if you still want to be that doctor you always wanted to be, then you need to do what I say right now…”\n\n\n\nDr. Gossey orders you to help her clean up this mess. The corpse of the daquala is placed in a new container. She says she can probably present a dead one without as many problems. She really was hoping for a live one though.\n\n\n\nYou ask her about the bodies of the adventurers, and she tells you grab that axe and start chopping them up. She then opens up another panel, presses a few buttons to reveal a secret passage. She enters the passage and comes back out with a big dumpster on wheels.\n\n\n\n“When you hack them into small enough pieces, put them into this dumpster and feed the wazia in the next room. Don’t worry he’s quite tame; just make sure you throw the parts at him from a safe distance.\n\n\n\nYou snap out of your shock. A wazia? Those huge things live in the Cloudspeak Mountains and they’ve been known to even prey on trolls and small manticores! You’re almost about to question Dr. Gossey about how she got one of those things, but you stop yourself. The why’s and how’s aren’t even important right now, what matters is getting out of this mess.\n\n\n\nAfter stopping yourself from vomiting several times during your dismemberment of Ben and Hanon, you proceed to nervously feed the wazia, which isn’t even chained up. You half expect it to gobble you up in one gulp or even Dr. Gossey shutting you in, neither happens. You toss limbs near the beast and it eats a few, and ignores the rest. You presume it will eat them later and you get the hell out of there.\n\n\n\n“You see why I couldn’t have yet another illegal creature on campus? I’m already running a risk with that wazia. If you think what happened here was bad, you should’ve seen what happened when the adventurers I hired were demanding payment for that thing! Speaking of which I suppose I should pay you the rest of your money. Sorry about the threats before. It was sort of a tense moment you know. I’m sure you understand.”\n\n\n\nYou just nod and don’t argue. It’s unspoken that you won’t be saying anything to anyone about this. What could you say anyway? After Dr. Gossey gives you some new lab clothes to change into, you head home exhausted.\n\n\n\nThe next day you don’t even bother going to class, you sleep in late and spend a majority of the afternoon sitting in your room thinking about some of the shit you’ve done to achieve your goals. Serving homemade alcohol without a license seems to be the least of your crimes now.\n\n\n\n“Okay, okay, I just did what I had to do. It’s all for a good cause, I’m just trying to better myself.” You say and try to wipe your concerns about the morality of it all. You then head downstairs to the surprise of Wendy who figured you were at school.\n\n\n\n“Stayed home today eh? How come you didn’t come down when I opened this place up?”\n\n“I was busy.”\n\n“Hmm, okay then. I know you left with those two adventurers and that monster last night. I’m guessing that business is settled then?”\n\n“Yeah, it’s all settled.”\n\n\n\nTrue words in many ways. You have enough money to continue your education and with this financial pressure off, you easily pass the rest of your classes with no worries. You later sell off the inn (Which pisses off Rita and Wendy who now have to find new jobs, Eliza and Alan are a bit upset as well), get a cheap apartment near the campus and given your close relationship with Dr. Gossey you get a good job working at the hospital while you complete medical school. It isn’t easy of course, but given what you’ve already been through you’re able to handle it.\n\n\n\nEventually you do fulfill your goals of becoming a doctor. You don’t stay in Klyton though. You have too many bad memories and reminders of “bad things” going on there in general. So you move to the Delantium Kingdom, specifically a border city called Sivak, which has great demand for doctors at their new hospital. The rest of your life is a relatively good one.\n\n\n\nStill, you do have your bouts of guilt every now and then with some of your choices that got you to where you are, sometimes wondering if you could’ve handled a few things better at the inn.\n\n\n\nWho can say, but in any case your days as an innkeeper are long over.\n",
  "page 109": "You never really had a relationship with Eliza on any romantic level; it’s probably just the “idea of Eliza” that’s getting to you. Your life is probably going to change a lot in the near future so your mind is starting to look for loopholes to stay.\n\n\n\nBut you shake off these feelings. Your life is going good right now, why jeopardize it with poor judgment and fear of the unknown? You overcame hardship to get where you are now. To invite more drama when it isn’t necessary would be foolish.\n\n\n\nYou head home and when Cindy is finished with her classes you take her out for romantic dinner to reaffirm your dedication of your future plans together. This seems to please her greatly.\n\n\n\nDuring your last remaining year in Klyton, you don’t visit your family’s inn anymore as a safety precaution. You don’t need doubt plaguing your thoughts again. You do make one more visit to your mom before you do eventually leave though.\n\n\n\nThanks to Cindy’s family connections in the Delantium Kingdom, your job at the Sivak hospital is more or less secured (Obviously hers is as well), though they were in need of more medical professionals anyway. The hospital there is a little newer and understaffed, so for a while you’re working a little more than you usually did, but over time your workload becomes manageable.\n\n\n\nYour life in general plays out rather mundanely, you end up living in a nice area and eventually you have a couple of children. No major problems for you ever truly crop up though.\n\n\n\nAs for the old inn, your mother eventually does sell it a few years after you initially left Klyton and retires to Teckleville. On one of your family visits you ask who bought the place and she says Wendy ended up taking it over, which doesn’t surprise you. Curiosity gets the better of you and you ask your mother for more information on your old co-workers. Your mother mentions that Rita quit about a few months before she sold the place. Apparently she finally snagged a guy rich enough to settle down with. Flameflower took her place as hostess and she, along with her sister Sunshine still work there. As for Eliza your mother says she was still working as the head barmaid there.\n\n\n\n“All seems like a lifetime ago eh?” your mother says.\n\n“Yeah. I suppose so.” You answer a little preoccupied.\n\n“Is there something wrong son?”\n\n“Oh no. Nothing wrong, just momentarily lost in thought.”\n\n\n\nYou don’t really explain anymore than that, but your mother senses that you’re playing “what could’ve been” again. She doesn’t address it directly, but does mention of how successful you are and how you’ve got a good life. She also mentions of how it’s everything that your father and her could’ve hoped for you. This truth snaps you out of it, and you never dwell on the past again.\n\n\n\nYou live out the rest of your life in Sivak working as a physician until you decide to retire. You grow old with Cindy, your children eventually have their own families, and one day you fall asleep and don’t wake up.\n\n\n\nYes, it was a good life overall, but your years as an innkeeper were definitely the ones that helped achieve it.\n",
  "page 54": "Given that Dr. Kovas rarely compliments anyone, he has to like you a lot. You decide it might be best to take advantage of that fact. After his class you approach him about your situation, but he doesn’t seem very sympathetic.\n\n\n\n“Yes, yes, I’m sure your problems are very important to you, but my question is why are you telling me?”\n\n“Well that’s what I was getting at, I wanted to know if there was something I could do to help you out. Some way of maybe earning more money…”\n\n“Money? Hah! What do you think this is a factory employment line? If you want to help me, you shouldn’t be doing it for cash m’boy. You should be doing it for the love of science!”\n\n\n\nHe starts to make his way out of the classroom, but you follow.\n\n\n\n“Dr. Kovas, I’d love to help for the love of science, but I’m not exactly in a position to do so! I mean I’ve got so many expenses and responsibilities and…”\n\n“Stop right there m’boy. Again you’re telling me these things as if I can do something about them…or that I WANT to do something about them.”\n\n“(sputter)…because I thought that given how much you praise my work in class you’d want to help out a potential fellow future doctor.” You say getting exasperated.\n\n“YOU? A fellow doctor? Ha ha ha ha! Granted you may have the ability to be a doctor one day, but if you think you’d ever approach someone of my caliber, I’ve sorely underestimated your capacity for logical thinking.” Dr. Kovas laughs.\n\n\n\nAt this point you’re angry, you came to get help, not be insulted by this asshole. You’re hesitant to outright insult him back though since you still need to finish his class, so you just decide to leave.\n\n\n\n“Alright fine, don’t help me then. I just thought you were different from the other rich elitist bastards that look their noses down at me just because of my working class background. I’ll just leave…”\n\n“Wait, wait, you think I’m looking down on you because of your humble roots? My, my someone has an inferiority complex. M’boy I’m looking down on you because you’re whining about your problems to me. You have much potential and despite your pathetic tales of woe it is obvious that you’ve overcome much and are determined in your goals to become a doctor. I think however you could do something more, but unless you’re willing to help me for the love of science, not because of money, or what I might be able to do for you then I think you will languish in mediocrity like most that pass through my class.”\n\n\n\nAt this point you don’t know what the hell kind of head game Dr. Kovas is playing with you, but if there is some sort of possibility that he might help you, then you might need to play along.\n\n\n\n“I don’t believe you. Or rather I don’t believe you’ll help me for the right reasons. You’re going to help, because you still believe that I’m going to help you.”\n\n“Yes.” You blurt out.\n\n“Heh, well at least you’re honest now. All right I’m going to roll the dice with you and allow you to help me on a project I’ve been working on. I’ll even assure you that you will profit from this because I know you seem to be concerned about such things.”\n\n“”I’m really not, I just need extra money to…”\n\n“Don’t interrupt!” Dr. Kovas snaps. “As I was saying, you will profit from this, but it is my hope that you will come to do this for science more than anything. Because if you aren’t then you’re in the wrong field.”\n\n“I thought the field of medicine was primarily to help the sick.” You say.\n\n“Bah! Helping people? Nonsense! Most so called doctors aren’t in it to help people, they’re in it for the money! They’re all a bunch of soulless greed automatons that have no real passion for the mysteries of the human body and all this field has to offer!”\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas has a reputation for misanthropy and cynicism, but you weren’t aware how much until just now, still he says he’s willing to help you and that’s good enough for you.\n\n\n\n“Now then, if you are going to help me, you need to meet me at my lab tonight and whatever you do, don’t tell anyone about it. When you get inside you are NOT to discuss what you see with anyone, do you understand?”\n\n“Um, what exactly are we going to be doing?” you ask a little concerned.\n\n“You’ll see soon enough, but it’s a secret project that will change the way modern medicine works! I can’t afford to have anyone stealing my ideas! So I need you to be all the way in on this! If you’re going to hesitate, then get out of my sight right now.”\n\n“Okay, okay, I’ll help you.”\n\n“Good. See you tonight.” Dr. Kovas says and walks away.\n\n\n\nYou put in some time at the inn, but later leave Wendy in charge and tell her to close it down if you aren’t back by closing time. You remind Alan to lock everything up. Wendy of course isn’t very pleased with this idea and reminds you once again of how she’s overworked. You just apologize and leave.\n\n\n\nWhen you get to Dr. Kovas’ lab he doesn’t immediately open the door, and you have to wait about five minutes before he comes out to scold you that you’re five minutes late! You don’t argue though, you just enter only for Dr. Kovas to immediately ask you a disturbing question.\n\n\n\n“Can you kill a man?”\n\n“WHAT?!”\n\n“Or woman, in fact a woman might be better. Yes, I need you to kill a woman.”\n\n\n\nYou’re literally speechless for a few moments before sputtering your protests.\n\n\n\n“Dr. Kovas, I didn’t sign up to kill people!”\n\n“Yes you did, the moment you said you’d help me. (Sigh) Look, progress in medical science has always required sacrifices. Sometimes that sacrifice has involved the lives of others. What is one life compared to the wonders that scientific break through can do?”\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas isn’t just misanthropic, he’s sociopathic and you’re out of here.\n\n\n\n“I’m not a killer and I’m not capable of this. So I’m just going to leave. You needn’t worry I won’t tell anyone.”\n\n“Sorry son, I can’t take that chance, nighty night!”\n\n\n\nDr Kovas suddenly produces a needle filled with something and injects you with it. You push him away and try the door handle only to find it locked. You don’t struggle with it for long though before you pass out.\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up you’re strapped to a table, with Dr. Kovas shaking his head at you.\n\n\n\n“What am I going to do with you? I placed what little faith I have in humanity in you and this is how you act? It’s my own fault I suppose.”\n\n\n\nYou try to talk, but most of your body is still paralyzed.\n\n\n\n“Now then, I’m going to give you ONE last chance because I still see potential in you. After this wears off I want you to go out and get a girl. I don’t care how, just do it and bring her here. You don’t even need to kill her, just bring her here and I’ll do the deed. Do you think you can handle that?”\n\n\n\nYou still can’t talk, but you know damn well if you don’t agree he’s certainly going to kill you, so you strain yourself to nod “yes”.\n\n\n\n“Good, I’ll release you. Oh and just to let you know, you only have until dawn. I’ve injected you with a toxin to ensure you don’t go running off or something silly like that. Don’t bother with trying to get an antidote either, it’s a special toxic mix that only I have the cure to.”\n\n\n\nYou get up, very wobbly and still a little dizzy. By the time you start regaining all your faculties Dr. Kovas has shoved you out his lab door and locked it.\n\n\n\nYou feel like you’re living a nightmare, but you don’t have much of a choice, you need to bring a woman back to the lab before dawn or you’re going to die. This isn’t going to be easy not just due to the immorality of the situation, but also because you haven’t exactly been a ladies man. What with all the studying and work at the inn, you don’t have much of a social life.\n\n\n\nYou figure your best bet might be to go to one of the many college parties near campus and hope to get a drunk girl, though you could just go get a regular whore.\n",
  "page 98": "You don’t know if you’ll forever be indebted to Edmond, but at least you know his character a little bit better than Hans. Telling Hans you’re not going to go through with his plan though would be foolish, the only way to do this is to act like you are and then rat him out when you get to Edmond. Not the noblest of plans, but you see that you have little choice.\n\n\n\nWhen you leave the hospital you enter the carriage, which is waiting for you across the street.\n\n\n\n“I trust you got everything you need?”\n\n“Yeah, I found something perfect to take care of our problem.”\n\n“Excellent! I knew you’d see things my way.” Hans says. He doesn’t seem to think you’re going to double cross him, which is good news for you. Hans goes on a little more about how you’re doing the right thing and to make sure to stay calm throughout the whole procedure\n\n\n\nYou get back to the tavern where Reg and several other Talon members are waiting.\n\n\n\n“What the fuck took you so damn long? Edmond could’ve died already!”\n\n“Sorry.” You reply and head to his office.\n\n\n\nYou enter the office and the Sotakan assassin is holding a dagger to your throat already.\n\n\n\n“Down boy, it’s the doc...ugh…what the fuck took you so long? I’m dying over here!”\n\n\n\nThe Sotakan releases you and you run over to Edmond who is now lying on the floor still clutching his side. You begin working on Edmond immediately.\n\n\n\n“Argh, fuck! That hurt!” Edmond winces as you take out a few pieces of shrapnel before sewing him up.\n\n“Yeah I imagine it would. I got some bad news to tell you.”\n\n“What worse than getting shot?\n\n“Well maybe not as bad as that, but how close are you to Hans and his brother?”\n\n“We’re business associates though they’ve been working for me since they were snot nosed kids. So I suppose I’m like a father figure to them. Heh heh.”\n\n“Then they’re ready to commit patricide, because they tried to get me to kill you.”\n\n“What!?”\n\n\n\nYou explain to Edmond what Hans told you as you’re working on him. He’s mad, but not at you. In fact he doesn’t even accuse you of making it up. He says it’s hardly surprising given the business he’s in. He calls over his Sotakan and tells him “Hans, Wallace, dead.” With this simple instruction, the lizard assassin finally leaves the room to do his mission.\n\n\n\nDoesn’t take long for the Sotakan to come back.\n\n\n\n“Wow. I guess that’s the end of that then.” You say still working on Edmond.\n\n“Looks like. Hey doc, that was a real standup thing ya did. You probably could’ve easily injected me with some shit that could’ve killed me without even my lizard boy even realizing it before it was too late.”\n\n“I’m not a killer, despite my unfortunate lapse of judgment concerning how to deal with those waitresses a few years ago.”\n\n“Hmm, well I’m sure it probably still passed through your mind. Especially how that deal went down with Frank’s place. Anyway, Hans was probably right about one thing, I was going to hang that incident over your head for the rest of your life, but given these recent events let’s call it even.”\n\n“Thanks Edmond.” You say politely. Sure you could get self-righteous and point out that you’ve saved his life TWICE. But really, why piss off a crime boss?\n\n\n\nAfter patching up Edmond and making sure he’s not going to get an infection, you mention that he should be fine as long as he takes it easy for a couple months. He thanks you again and says if you ever need another favor you know where to find him. You assure him that you won’t.\n\n\n\nYou get on with your life after this last bit of dabbling with the underworld. Part of you for a while worries that Edmond is going to go back on his word, but that doesn’t happen thankfully. You definitely feel a great weight has been lifted off of you. You also properly dispose of the Incitahol. You’d normally report something like this, but you’d rather not have to explain why you were breaking into the pharmaceutical cabinet in the first place. You just hope whoever was dumb enough to put the stuff there doesn’t have any more of it.\n\n\n\nAs for your family’s inn, your mother eventually sells it in a few years and moves back to Teckleville. You aren’t unhappy to see it sold off; you didn’t have too many great memories of the place in the last years you were there. Still, if it weren’t for the inn you wouldn’t have been able to become a doctor either.\n\n\n\nWhile the rest of your life generally plays out in a positive way, you never do lose your minor alcohol problem because every once in awhile you still feel guilt about some of the things you were involved in. Drinking helps ease the pain a bit, but you never talk to anyone else about it of course. Sometimes you wonder what you could’ve done different when you worked at the inn, a better way perhaps.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 108": "You go back to the inn. You don’t know what the hell you’re doing, but you’re doing it.\n\n\n\n“Back so soon doc?” Rita says as you ignore her and look for Eliza.\n\n\n\nYou instinctively head back to the kitchen where you find her talking to some of the other staff members.\n\n\n\n“Eliza, I have to talk to you!” you say anxiously.\n\n“Um…okay, I’m almost done here.”\n\n\n\nYou wait impatiently for Eliza to finish talking to her subordinates, while you’re doing that your mother is eyeing you suspiciously as she begins cooking a large piece of meat.\n\n\n\nYou can’t wait here! This was a mistake! You have to leave now!\n\n\n\nYou rush out of the kitchen, but you don’t get far when you feel Eliza’s hand grab your shoulder.\n\n\n\n“Hey, where are you going? I thought you had to talk to me.” She says.\n\n\n\nYou turn around and nothing comes out. You just take one look at her face and you can’t contain yourself. You grab and kiss her right on the lips. This is followed by a few cheers and claps from the patrons in the bar.\n\n\n\n“Huh, took him long enough to realize it.” Wendy says and goes back to cleaning the bar.\n\n\n\nEliza’s response is pure shock. She doesn’t know what to do except run into the ladies room. You call out to her before realizing you’ve done this in front of several onlookers. You panic again and run into the kitchen.\n\n\n\n“What’s going on out there? Did I hear you call out Eliza’s name? What did you do?”\n\n“I…I fucked up…” you blurt out.\n\n\n\nYou quickly explain what just happened and your mother shakes her head while throwing a washcloth on the table.\n\n\n\n“(Sigh) I KNEW something was up when you wanted to talk to her and were acting more jittery than a goblin caught in a troll’s larder. I don’t know what to tell you son except you’ve handled this poorly. This is definitely something you’re going to have to fix yourself, but you need to do it soon, because Eliza’s one of the best employees here and I don’t need her all upset right now.”\n\n\n\nYou think about slipping out the back, but your mother’s right, you need to take care of this now. At least part of it, because you’ll need to take care of the rest tonight when you talk to Cindy.\n\n\n\nYou sheepishly exit the kitchen wondering if everyone will be looking. Most glance your way, but go back to their business.\n\n\n\n“She’s down in the cellar doctor love.” Wendy says.\n\n\n\nNot saying another word you go down to the cellar. You see Eliza trying to keep busy by taking stock of the beer casks with another employee you don’t know.\n\n\n\n“Eliza.”\n\n“I can’t talk anymore, I really have to make sure we have enough beer this month. Our shipment is a little late. It was nice seeing you.” She answers without looking in your direction.\n\n“Eliza we need to talk about what just happened.”\n\n“I think we should just forget about it. Shouldn’t you be getting home? I’m sure Cindy will be wondering about where you are.”\n\n\n\nAt this point you grab Eliza again and tell the stock boy to leave, he doesn’t seem to want to get involved in whatever drama you two have so he complies.\n\n\n\n“Let me go.”\n\n“Okay, but we’re gonna talk!”\n\n“Talk about what? About me being the other woman? I don’t want to be that and Cindy doesn’t deserve it! I don’t deserve it!”\n\n“I’m gonna break up with Cindy! I want you. I know that now. I should’ve acted on it earlier…”\n\n“You certainly should have! (sob) Do you know how much I wanted you to say something? Years! From the moment you came back to this inn after your father died, I wanted you to say something. Now it’s too late!”\n\n“It’s not too late! I just said I’ll break up with Cindy then we can be together!”\n\n“Just like that huh? You can toss her aside so easily? I thought you were in love with her.”\n\n“I was…I mean…no…agh! Shit look, I want to be with you! Why are you making this so difficult?”\n\n“Because it IS fucking difficult! (sob) I had just come to accept the fact that you and I were never going to happen no matter how much I wanted it. (sob) And now you come back and stir all my emotions up, because you’re having doubts about your relationship with Cindy? What the hell happens when you start having doubts about me one day?”\n\n“That wouldn’t happen…”\n\n“How do I know? I mean… (sniffle) we’ve never even gone out on a date. How do you know if we’re even going to be compatible?”\n\n“Well let’s go on one right now. Anywhere you want!”\n\n“Just leave me alone. I need time to myself.”\n\n\n\nYou try to touch Eliza to reassure her, but she flinches away. You don’t say anything else and leave her be like she wanted.\n\n\n\nOn your way home you think about everything and how badly it all went. You didn’t know Eliza pined after you for so long. You really had no idea. If you did you would’ve…\n\n\n\nWould’ve, could’ve, should’ve, doesn’t really matter now. What matters now is what you’re going to do about all this. Eliza also brought up a good point on how can you possibly know that you’re compatible and how it looks like you’re just reaching out to her because of your doubts with Cindy.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Cindy, you need to figure out what you’re going to say to her when you get home.\n",
  "page 13": "If it’s only for a couple days, what can it hurt and you’re getting a good deal on his alcohol, so you figure it’s a good idea. This does not go well with your mother who says you’re going to get the pair of you further into debt. It takes some time, but eventually you manage to convince her that the money you’re saving will be worth the couple days out of the month that he actually comes up here.\n\n\nMeanwhile Calwin calls his lackeys to unload his cart and take the stuff down to your cellar. Calwin then states he’s going to retire to his room and that if any of your barmaids want to join him his door will be open.\n\n\n\nThe next couple days aren’t exactly pleasant, Calwin is a complete lecherous slob and leaves not only his room a disgusting mess, but hangs around the bar all day trying to grope the barmaids. (Rita in particular) You have to warn him several times to leave them alone, and eventually one of the miners who has a crush on Rita punches him in the face resulting in a minor scuffle in which Calwin is not the winner.\n\n\n\nYou fully expect Calwin to claim that he’s never dealing with you again, but as it turns out he doesn’t think anything of it. Indeed he claims if it had been a bar in Hessla he probably would’ve gotten a knife in the eye instead, so he considers himself lucky. Eventually he leaves and everyone is glad, but there’s the sickening feeling that you know you’re going to have to put up with him a few times every month.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the week you haven’t saved any money. In fact you’ve barely broke even.\n\n\n\nWhile you’re sweeping up the inn early morning, a non-descript man of medium height enters with two bigger figures. One of them is unmistakably an ogre while the other guy is just a tall muscular human. Either one could break you in half.\n\n\n\n“Are you are Mr. Reynolds?” you ask, knowing that it has to be him.\n\n“That would be me. I take it you’re the son of my late debtor? I do hope you realize that the debt doesn’t end with him dying…” Mr. Reynolds says\n\n“No, no of course not. I’ve got some of what my father owed.”\n\n\n\nYou hand over the most you can under the circumstances, but Mr. Reynolds looks insulted.\n\n\n\n“My boy do you take me for an asshole? Your father used to pay me much more than this pittance!”\n\n“It was a rough week…”\n\n“No, no, I don’t give a shit about your excuses, you’ve chosen to take on your father’s debt so you are expected to fucking pay up like he did! (Sigh) Look, since you’re obviously new to this, I’ll let you off with a warning. Olaf.”\n\n\n\nSuddenly the ogre steps forward with a smile and punches you the stomach. You temporarily lose the ability to breath and collapse on the floor. When you finally do catch your breath, you promptly vomit.\n\n\n\n“That was my warning, let’s hope I don’t need to do it again. Be seeing you again in a few weeks kid. Let’s get out of here.”\n\n\n\nAs Mr. Reynolds leaves, your mother comes running up from the cellar wondering what’s going on. She helps you up when she sees you.\n\n\n\n“Oh no son I can’t let this go on. We’re selling the inn right now!”\n\n“No, no mom, it’s alright, you’ll see. We’re going to make this place profitable and payback the loan and after that we’ll be able to take the next step.”\n\n“Son, I love you, but you’ve made a lot of questionable decisions as far as business is concerned. I mean if this keeps up, I’m stepping in before this place goes to hell so I can actually make money selling it to the city.”\n\n“You won’t get enough for it!”\n\n“Well I’ll get enough to pay off the debt, and if worst comes to worst, I’ll leave Klyton and live with my sister in Teckleville”\n\n“You can’t live with aunt Enora, you always said she’s crazy.”\n\n“She is, but that still doesn’t mean she wouldn’t help me out.”\n\n“Look, we’ve still got time, I know my ideas are going to help us out soon.”\n\n“Well, I hope all your fancy schooling you gained some sort of insight that I’m not privy to. Alright we’ll give it until the next time Mr. Reynolds comes around for payment.”\n\n\n\nYou agree and start wiping up the floor before customers come in.\n\n\n\nThe next few days are uneventful; the miners seem to be enjoying the new Hessla ale though so that’s a relief. They even seem to be talking to you a little more, one in particular Ular has been chewing your ear quite frequently. He’s the one that has an obvious crush on Rita, but you’ve never seen him actually talk to her on any serious level. Strange that a big tough miner would be too shy to speak to a girl, but there it is.\n\n\n\n“So how long have you known Rita?” Ular asks.\n\n“Me? Well she started working here just before I left for college so I didn’t speak to her too much back then, and I haven’t really spoken to her too much other than about duties around the inn since I’ve got back here.”\n\n“She’s so beautiful, you know? I always wonder if she isn’t a Delantium Princess hiding out or something.”\n\n“Yeah, she’s a pretty girl.” You reply.\n\n“Can you speak to her for me?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Just speak to her for me. I try, but I…dunno I don’t have the words! I get all tongue tied an’ shit. I mean you’re a smart guy, you went to college an’ shit. Maybe you can tell her better how I feel than I can.”\n\n“I dunno if should get involved in this…”\n\n“Please man, just do it…oh shit here she comes!”\n\n\n\nAt this point Ular stumbles over his own feet trying to get to a dark corner before Rita arrives for more ale. Feeling a little sorry for the guy, you talk to Rita.\n\n\n\n“Hey Rita, this is going to be strange question, but…”\n\n“Oh gods, you’re not going to start hitting on me too are you?”\n\n“What? Uh no! But well, there’s a miner named Ular who’s sort of nuts about you.”\n\n“Yeah, he’s nuts over me like every other miner here trying to get under my skirt.”\n\n“Heh, I don’t think so, he’s so damn shy he’s practically afraid to speak to you, and surely you’ve noticed.”\n\n“Yeah I suppose I have. I will admit he’s a little different than the rest of these ale swilling pigs.”\n\n“So are you interested in him?”\n\n“Eh…I dunno. I mean from what I know of him he seems respectful and he did punch out that fucker Calwin when he groped me, but that’s not really enough. I need a man that’s going places. I mean he’s a miner; where’s that going to lead me? Not in fine Selkie furs and a big house, I’ll just be barefoot and pregnant and still living here.”\n\n\n\nSame old Rita. Still, you can certainly understand her desire to move up in the world. However, a miner still makes a decent living. A lot better than her that’s for sure. She’d still be “moving up.”\n",
  "page 12": " \n\n“You’re selling the inn?!”\n\n“I have to! I can’t run this place myself.”\n\n“Well that’s what you have staff for!”\n\n“Oh son…(sniff) I don’t think you know the entire situation. You haven’t been around as much over the years.”\n\n“Mom, I always meant to visit more, but…”\n\n“No, it’s not that. In fact I’m glad you had fun at college. You at least had some enjoyment. I’m just sorry you won’t get to have any more.”\n\n“Mom, I don’t like where this is going.”\n\n\n\nYou mom at this point begins cry again until you eventually get her to calm down. What comes next almost makes you cry though.\n\n\n\nWhile your father did indeed save for you, it wasn’t enough to put you through college completely. Costs were higher than he thought and even though business was okay, he had unexpected expenses such as making fixes to the inn and price hikes in his alcohol supplier.\n\n\n\nYour father was determined to not pull you out of college though, so he found another way. He borrowed money from a moneylender.\n\n\n\n“WHAT?! Why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve taken less classes or gotten a part time job at the university!”\n\n“No, he didn’t want you to worry or get distracted.”\n\n“Well I guess that’s good since all that worry can go to this now! By the gods, why didn’t he at least go to a bank to get the loan!?”\n\n“He tried, but didn’t get approved. They wouldn’t even take the inn as collateral. I pleaded with him not to borrow money from criminals, but he claimed it would be fine as long as he opened the tavern earlier, found a cheaper supplier and made a few cuts here and there. And for a while things were running a little smoother, but I could see the stress taking a toll on him. It’s what ultimately killed him. I’m just so sorry that we failed you. We wanted so much better for you. Now I’ll have to sell the inn off to pay off the moneylender and hopefully I’ll be able to find a job as a cook elsewhere.”\n\n\n\nYou just sit in silence and try to wrap your head around all of this. Your bright future in medicine as you know is gone. You still have quite a bit of education, and you’re fairly certain you could still find a job to support yourself, but it’s going to be hard initially and you probably won’t be satisfied with it. You’re also worried about your mom, what if she can’t find a job? You won’t be able to help her much.\n\n\n\nYou can only think of one solution.\n\n\n\n“Would it help if I ran the inn?” you ask.\n\n“What?” your mother replies.\n\n“Would it help if I helped you run this place. I mean granted I don’t have excessive experience, I have watched you guys do it while I grew up here. I think I can manage the basics. If we managed to keep this place running at least long enough to pay off the loan, maybe then I can save enough to finish my education.”\n\n“I don’t know son, I mean…I would love to see you finish your education, but it’s a lot to take on. Would you have time? I don’t want you getting burned out and suffering a pre-mature heart attack like your father because of the stress!”\n\n“Well, I’m going to have nothing but time now, if I drop out and focus on this place. I think the main concern is getting us out of debt…just how much do you owe?”\n\n“Uh…about ten thousand gold coins.”\n\n\n\nYou really hoped it would be significantly less than that.\n\n\n\n“Okay, well I’m guessing he takes smaller payments to buy you time but then charges more interest with each passage of time. We’ll have to get this place whipped into shape so it’s making enough profit that we’ll be able to pay the entire sum as soon as possible. After that, we’ll have some breathing room.”\n\n\n\nYour mom looks apprehensive about all this and then shakes her head claiming she can’t let you shoulder this responsibility especially with the risk of physical danger involved if you anger the moneylender in some way.\n\n\n\nShe says that you should go on with your life and forget about the inn, she’ll be able to sell it and pay off the debt with no problem. And as for her, she also tells you not to worry about her either, but she hopes that you’ll forgive her and your father for failing in giving you the life you deserve.\n\n\n\nIt is true you could walk away from all this. You don’t really have any great desire to run the inn. It was just a solution you came up with to help your mom and possibly help yourself. But there’s no guarantee it’s going to work, just like there’s no guarantee that you can’t still achieve your goals on your own.\n",
  "page 56": "You can’t let him fuck this up for you, Dr. Gossey just needs a little more time. You rush to talk to Hanon.\n\n\n\n“Outta my way, me and Ben are getting that monster!” Hanon says pushing you aside.\n\n“No! No! Hold on! Wait! Just give her more time!”\n\n“More time? I’m getting fucking exhausted up keeping the wards! Not to mention it’s getting more and more agitated in that cage. Also we’ve been spending most of our money here, if this keeps up we’re going to be broke!”\n\n“Okay how about for the remainder of your stay here, everything is free for you and Ben? That should certainly take the stress off shouldn’t it?”\n\n“Hmm, free huh? (Sigh) Alright, you’ve bought yourself some more time and ain’t sayin’ how much, but YOU better go talk to your teacher and tell her she needs to get her shit together soon or I will be coming to drop this fucker on her doorstep!”\n\n\n\nHanon and his buddy at this point proceed to the bar to indulge in their free booze.\n\n\n\nA few more days pass and Hanon and Ben are getting drunk every night. Didn’t used to be a problem before mainly because they were holding back due to funds, but now with free reign they’re becoming the lives of the party on a regular basis. In addition to drinking they’re picking fights with your other paying customers which results in broken furniture.\n\n\n\nCombine this with the higher wages you have to pay your staff and you’re hemorrhaging money. You see Dr. Gossey everyday about taking the daquala, but she just says the same thing all the time “still clearing through the red tape.” It’s getting really old, and you begin to get pissed at her, to which her response is if you want to a career in medicine you’ll do what the hell you’re told and shut up about it.\n\n\n\nYou head back to the inn cursing the fact you ever asked her for help.\n\n\n\n“HEY ITS DA (HIC!) INNKEEPER! GO MAKE YERSELF USEFUL FOR ONCE AND GET US NOTHER DRINK! HAR HAR HAR!” Benjamin bellows as you enter the inn. Seems that he and Hanon are getting an early start.\n\n\n\nYou storm over to the bar and begin ranting at your staff which is doing nothing.\n\n\n\n“Wendy why the fuck are all of you standing around not doing your fucking jobs?”\n\n“Because they drank all the fucking booze and you told us to not go downstairs to get refill casks. Not that we’d go down there in the first place, you don’t give us nearly enough danger pay for that.”\n\n\n\nYou grumble and swear as you head down the cellar steps.\n\n\n\n“I don’t fucking deserve this shit! I was supposed to be finishing up medical school by now, not cleaning up shit around this place! Thanks a lot dad! You ever think when you started borrowing from a fucking loan shark? Fucking…”\n\n\n\nYou cut your rant short when you suddenly hear a low growl. At first you figure it’s just the daquala again and you’re right except he’s not in his cage anymore. Ever since the free booze policy Hanon’s been taking advantage of, he’s also been getting lax in checking on the daquala. The constant alcoholic haze hasn’t really been helping on his concentration for keeping up the wards on the cage either. All of which contributed to the daquala finally breaking out of his confinement.\n\n\n\nStill thinking it’s still in its cage, you go get a cask of booze. You’ve barely managed to pick one up and you feel a sharp pain in your leg. You fall to the floor, dropping the cask and yelling for help when you see the amount of blood leaking from the sizable hole in your leg.\n\n\n\nIt’s the last thing you do, before the daquala’s next attack is on your throat.\n",
  "page 15": "This guy is a complete creep and going to be nothing but trouble. You’d rather continue paying the Klyton supplier.

You aren’t really listening to anything they say because you’re more preoccupied with the future and trying to figure out how you’re going to get out of debt and more importantly how to avoid getting beat up or worse.\n\n\n\n“So what’s you’re problem, Mr. Barkeep?” a miner asks, which none of them has ever done before, so it breaks you out of your trance long enough for you to utter “Huh?”\n\n\n\n“I asked what’s troubling you? And don’t tell me nothin’ because for the past few days you’ve been staring off at the walls.” Davin asks. He’s a bit of a loner type, mostly drinks alone, which makes his questioning even stranger.\n\n“Oh nothing.”\n\n“Heh, I told you not to tell me that. Seriously, what’s wrong? Think of it this way, you have to hear most of these idiots tell their stories all the time, now you’ve got someone willing to hear yours.”\n\n\n\nTrue enough, and you don’t see any harm so you tell him everything, your schooling, the inn, the debt, and how you’re worrying about all of it. He nods and listens to all of it, and it isn’t until you’re finished that he finally speaks.\n\n\n\n“Could you sell this place and get enough money to pay off the debt?” he asks.\n\n“Well probably…yeah.”\n\n“Then do it.”\n\n“What? I can’t do that!”\n\n“Why not? You’ll be safe and your mother will be safe, isn’t that the main goal?”\n\n“Well yeah, but…”\n\n“But nothing. All your other troubles are secondary when it comes to the survival of your family and yourself, or at least they should be.”\n\n“I can’t just worry about immediate survival Davin, there’s my future to worry about as well.”\n\n“Heh, well you’d better or you won’t have a future to worry about. Look son, I know you want the whole higher education thing. I remember you used to study all the time when you were little, but sometimes you have to be realistic. I mean I had big dreams too once, I thought about becoming an astronomer.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Hell yeah, but as I got older I realized that it wasn’t going to happen and I was gonna be a miner just like my dad…and that’s okay.”\n\n“But the inn…”\n\n“It’s just an inn son. There’s tons of them in the city, it’s not like we can’t find another place to drink. You’ve pretty much made it clear you don’t like working here and your mother is more than willing to sell it. You have no real attachments to it, so why put yourself through the hassle? You might not get to be a doctor, but you’ve still got a lot more education than most people, I’m sure you’ll be able to easily find something you’ll like to do more running an inn.”\n\n“I don’t know…”\n\n“Trust me kid, you’ll feel a lot better if you just let this one go.”\n\n\n\nAnd with those words Davin heads to a table to drink by himself, leaving you to ponder your situation.\n",
  "page 59": " \n\nNo shortage of parties going on right now and getting a drunk co-ed will be just like getting a whore except you won’t have to travel as far.\n\n\n\nYou head down to the popular night club near campus called the Wild Princess. After standing in line for an hour, you’re told by the bouncer that they don’t need people like you in there. You don’t bother arguing; you know you’re too “uncool” to get in, so you move on.\n\n\n\nYour next stop is going to a guild house party. You manage to sneak in thanks to a lot of people more concerned with having fun rather than crashers. Unfortunately a lot of the girls there aren’t remotely interested in the likes of you, but you sort of anticipated that would happen. Your plan is going to be to hang out here a few more hours then try to isolate a girl that should well be drunk at that point and offer to take her home.\n\n\n\nYou pass the time basically being a creepy stalker and watching which of the ladies are getting loaded, which of them have boyfriends, which of them are here by themselves, etc. Eventually you set your sights on a cute redhead who doesn’t seem to have any attachments and is definitely wobbly.\n\n\n\nYou breathe in deeply, exhale and walk towards the girl…only to get cock blocked by some guild member. Looks like he’s part of the university’s gladiator team too, so he’d easily crush you.\n\n\n\n“Hey babe, come on let’s get you some place where you can lie down.” He says and begins to guide her towards one the bedrooms while you curse your luck.\n\n\n\nYou could try to find another girl here, but you’re quite frankly sick of waiting around, you don’t have all night. It occurs to you that you’re a medical student while that guild guy is a muscle headed gladiator. Surely you should be able to out smart him. You see the back of his big head stand out in the crowd and follow him.\n\n\n\nHe gets the redhead to a private bedroom just like you anticipated, places her body on the bed and just as he goes to close the door you stop him.\n\n\n\n“Whoa shit dude! You’re not actually going to fuck that bitch are ya?” you say.\n\n“Huh? Well yeah! And who the fuck are you?”\n\n“You can’t fuck her man, she’s got Rotties!”\n\n“What?! Really? Nah, she doesn’t look like she does.”\n\n“Trust me dude, she does! My cousin’s in medical school and he said they had to do an assignment involving volunteers who had various non-life threatening diseases and she was one of them!”\n\n“Wait, wait, wouldn’t something like that be anonymous to protect the identities or some shit? And who are you again?” the gladiator asks proving he isn’t quite as dumb as you thought.\n\n“It was supposed to be anonymous, but my cousin’s a inconsiderate fucktard who told me all this shit anyway. Besides isn’t it good I did know and I was here to warn you?”\n\n“Yeah I suppose it was. Whew. Oh shit I touched her tits, I might have caught some shit!”\n\n“Nah, don’t worry about it, my cousin said unless you stick your dick in her, you’ll be fine.”\n\n“Fuck that! They don’t know all the shit about that disease yet! We need to get that bitch outta here before she infects everyone…and burn that bed too!”\n\n\n\nYou almost smile at how well this is working for you. You tell the gladiator that you’ll get her out of here. He says better you than him and heads to the bathroom.\n\n\n\nThe redhead is still sort of conscious, but definitely not aware of her surroundings.\n\n\n\n“Whozz you…I…(giggle) think I…(hic) drank too mush…” she says as you pick her up.\n\n\n\nThe walk back to Dr. Kovas’ lab is slow at first since the girl is still conscious, but eventually her incoherent babbling stops and she’s completely out of it, at which point you just pick her up and carry her. Of course you’re sweating being seen and questioned by campus security. Last thing you need is to get accused of date rape especially since you just saved this girl from getting date raped…of course you’re also taking her to her death.\n\n\n\nIt’s just a fucked up situation no matter how you look at it!\n\n\n\nLuckily you get to the lab with no problems. You bang on the door and Dr. Kovas pulls you both inside. He looks at the girl and frowns a bit.\n\n\n\n“Well I suppose she’ll do. I’m guessing you got her from one of the party’s near campus.”\n\n“Is that a problem?”\n\n“No, not at all, young girls go to wild parties and go missing around here all the time, and I certainly don’t have anything to do with all of those incidents. Anyway get her to the table and strap her down. I need to get some stuff from the back.\n\n\n\nYou follow Kovas’ orders and hope that one of the things he’s getting is your antidote.\n\n\n\nHe comes out with much more than your antidote, he comes out with a rolling cart filled with several medical instruments that look more like torture devices and tosses you a small vial of clear liquid.\n\n\n\n“Here, take this and put on some gloves. We’re about make history!” he says and injects the redhead on the table with some sort of liquid. It doesn’t take her long to stop breathing.\n\n\n\nYou swallow the contents of the vial which you hope is the antidote. You don’t feel any different after taking it though. You half wonder if he was bluffing about poisoning you at all. If that’s the case then you just brought a girl to her death for no reason, though it hardly matters at this point, as annoyed as you are at Dr. Kovas you might as well go through with this all the way.\n\n\n\nYou stand there for a moment just watching Dr. Kovas enthusiastically cutting into the girl and injecting more strange fluid directly into her vital organs. He suddenly stops when the girl comes back to life!\n\n\n\n“Ragh! Gargh! Argh!” she growls.\n\n\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you what exactly Dr. Kovas is experimenting with, Incitahol. It’s a banned concoction that was supposed to bring the dead back to life and it does, but only to create them as zombies. Lazy wannabe necromancers and mad scientists love the stuff, and would seem you’re working with the latter right now.\n\n\n\n“You’re experimenting with incitahol? This is your big project? I thought you’d be aware that this shit’s only good for creating zombies and not even controllable ones!” you say.\n\n“Ah, not yet anyway! I’ve made some changes to it. If you’ll notice the subject is not as aggressive as it would be under regular incitahol. Unfortunately it still seems quite hostile. I can’t be sure if this due to my changes in the drug, or the alcohol in her system screwing things up. I probably should’ve waited until she was sober and then proceeded (sigh) I’ll need a new subject.”\n\n\n\nYou’re hardly surprised at this request; you just say you’ll get on it tomorrow.\n\n\n\n“Hmm, very well. And try to get a sober one this time!”\n\n\n\nOver the course of a month you manage to get several “subjects” for Dr. Kovas and while he does eventually start contributing to your “college fund” you aren’t exactly overjoyed with what you’re doing especially since he’s insulting you at every given opportunity. While it’s true you are learning quite a bit about the human brain and other things about the human body he doesn’t seem like he’s getting anywhere with his own experiments. As far as you can tell he’s just cutting up girls and making them into zombies.\n\n\n\nOn another front, your inn staff has pretty much had it with you, specifically Wendy. She ends up quitting because she’s sick of having to look after the inn all day AND night while you secretly go disappearing to kidnap young girls. Rita certainly has no intention taking up the slack so she quits as well. This pretty much leaves you no option other than selling the inn and get a cheap apartment. Between the money you get from the sale and Dr. Kovas’ payment you have enough to finish up the rest of your classes, but the expenses of medical school are still going to be a struggle.\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas assures you that he can easily get you a good job at the hospital while you go through the rest of your schooling, but he’ll still need you to work for him as well. On the plus side he’s also offered you a free place to stay at his private lab. This would be convenient financially.\n\n\n\nThe downside to all this is of course you’d still be working for Dr. Kovas and all that entails. Even if you’ve managed to mostly shed yourself the moral implications of what you’ve been doing, there’s always the legal ones to worry about. Never mind the verbal abuse you’ll have to endure.\n\n\n\nYou could just say fuck it and go do something else, which has been crossing your mind at this point. You aren’t exactly sure what that might be, but after all the shit you’ve been through you are a little hesitant to put yourself through more.\n\n\n\nIt’s ultimately your choice on whether you still want to achieve your medical profession goals or not, but in any case your days as an innkeeper are over.\n",
  "page 9": "You think about it and realize your mom is right. Taking on this responsibility isn’t for you. All you’re mainly concerned about is getting the loan repaid and you’ll probably be able to do that by selling the inn to the city.\n\n\n\nThe pair of you keep the inn open one last week to make some extra money before closing it down for good. It’s another sad time for the miners who frequent there, because while granted they’ll either find another place to drink or continue to drink at this one under new management, your family has been a familiar sight here. When the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least your mother isn’t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother does find work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can’t really stand living in the city without your father anymore. She leaves to go live with your aunt in one of the small villages to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAfter a long time of the inn just sitting untended and forgotten due to the council having more pressing matters and red tape, it’s broken into by several homeless people who use it as a place to sleep. The homeless are soon ousted by a local gang who use it as a safe house. Eventually though they cause enough trouble that the Klyton Militia has to take severe action and storm the place, resulting in a small fire.\n\n\n\nAt this point someone in the council finally notices it, decides that the place isn’t worth salvaging and proposes that it be knocked down to build a medical clinic in its place to try to uplift the area. The motion passes.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you find a job thanks to your education level, but it isn’t anywhere in the field that you would’ve liked. You’re a clerk in a tax office, filing away items, straightening out reports and such. You never really move up and you never make enough money to save away to get ahead either.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have a bad life so much as a mind numbingly mundane one. You do have your good days, but ultimately you never really achieve your goals and always have a sense of dissatisfaction with your life.\n\n\n\nSometimes you wonder back, what if you had taken that chance and ran the inn? Would you have had a chance at a better life, or would you have made things worse?\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 14": "You tell him if he wants to spend a few days here that’s fine, but he’s paying like everyone else, either that he can lower the price of his alcohol to cover the cost. Calwin protests saying that he should be put up for free, but you’re unmoved. Eventually he tells you to forget it and tells his lackeys to just carry his booze down to your cellar and he’ll be on his way.\n\n\n\n“Glad you stood your ground on that one. Don’t really want his type hanging around anyway.” Your mother says.\n\n\n\nThe next few days are blessed ones. Some successful adventurers walk in with a whole lot of loot. They rest up in your nice rooms and tip generously. By the end of the week you’ve managed to save bit of money.\n\n\n\nWhile you’re sweeping up the inn early morning, a non-descript man of medium height enters with two bigger figures. One of them is unmistakably an ogre while the other guy is just a tall muscular human. Either one could break you in half.\n\n\n\n“Are you are Mr. Reynolds?” you ask, knowing that it has to be him.\n\n“That would be me. I take it you’re the son of my late debtor? I do hope you realize that the debt doesn’t end with him dying…” Mr. Reynolds says\n\n“No, no of course not. I’ve got your payment.”\n\n\n\nMr. Reynolds looks pleased that you’ve handed him a weighty bag of coins.\n\n\n\n“Nice. Glad to see we’re getting off on the right foot, kid. Wouldn’t want to have to sic Olaf here on you.” Mr. Reynolds says while patting his ogre goon on the arm. “Be seein’ ya in a few weeks kid.”\n\n\n\nAs Mr. Reynolds leaves, your mother comes running up from the cellar wondering what’s going on.\n\n\n\n“Was that Reynolds? Why didn’t you call me up here?!”\n\n“I had it under control, besides it all went well. We’re saving money, and hopefully those nice rooms we have will pay off still.”\n\n\n\nThe next few days are uneventful; the miners seem to be enjoying the new Hessla ale though so that’s a relief. They even seem to be talking to you a little more, one of the older miners Aglim, remarks about the adventurers that spent a few nights here awhile back.\n\n\n\n“Y’know that’s something I should’ve went into, instead of mining. You travel all over the damn place, killin things and take their shit. Sounds a hell of a lot more fun than spendin’ your time hittin’ the same damn piece of mountain over and over again.”\n\n“They didn’t speak too much to me, but they said they were coming back from the Cloudpeak Mountains. Said they found some old crypt filled with treasure.” You say.\n\n“Yeah, I’ll bet it was some old Dwarven tomb too. For their sake, they better hope the dwarves don’t find out about it. They aren’t too fond of outsiders desecrating their dead like that. Still, there’s been an increase in those types lately in the mountains and a lot of them have been passing back and forth through Klyton. You might want to do some advertising for your inn or something.” Aglim says before walking back to his table with his friends.\n\n\n\nHe does bring up an interesting point. You obviously have some nice rooms now, why not be a little pro-active and get more of these adventuring types to spend their ill gotten loot here?\n\n\n\nYou figure the best way to do this is appealing to the lowest common denominator. Sex appeal…\n\n\n\n“What?! Son I certainly hope you aren’t suggesting that…”\n\n“NO! I was thinking about someone a lot younger like one of the barmaids.”\n\n“Hmm, I’m not sure if that’s more or less insulting…very well I agree that getting those adventuring type in here would help out a lot. We used to have more, but ever since the Flying Griffon Inn opened up in the merchant district we get less of their business.”\n\n“Do you know anything about this other inn?”\n\n“Not much except it doesn’t really offer anything more than ours, it just happens to be in a better location, what with all the shops around it and all.”\n\n\n\nYou weren’t aware of this other inn, then again you’ve just been focusing on your immediate problems. Maybe you should actively try to discredit this other inn while you’re advertising. The one thing you need to do is speak to your barmaids about this.\n\n\n\n“Huh, well I can tell you right now I’m not parading around the streets trying to seduce passing adventurers like some harlot.” Wendy says.\n\n“I’ll do it, but I’m not sucking anyone’s cock!” Rita exclaims.\n\n“We…we have to suck someone’s cock?” Eliza asks looking a little worried.\n\n“ Argh! Nobody is going to have to suck anyone’s cock!” you yell. “Look I only need one of you to go out on the street, find adventurers and try to entice them into coming to our Inn. I don’t really care how you do it, just try your best, and that will most likely involve you looking as pretty as you can.”\n\n“Oh, well I suppose I could try to do that if I have to.” Eliza says.\n",
  "page 16": "You haven’t got off to a good start and you don’t think it’s really going to get any better. Davin’s words ring true, you aren’t happy running this place and trying to get to your goals by doing it, is either going to get you killed or burned out and miserable.\n\n\n\nYou immediately go to your mother and tell her how you feel, and she understands, she’s actually a bit relieved that you’ve decided to let her sell it. She tells you to take the rest of the night off and you return to your room where you feel saddened that you won’t get to go back to school, at least not anytime in the near future. Your goals of going into medicine will have to remain just dreams for now and you don’t know what your future holds.\n\n\n\nDuring the remaining week the inn stays open to make a last bit of change before closing for good and selling to the city. Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn’t like how it used to be anymore.\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren’t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother initially was going to find work in the city, but when you express a random desire to leave Klyton altogether, she suggests that you both move in with your aunt Enora in Teckleville. which is to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom. You agree eagerly, you’ve never been out of the city and maybe it’s time for a brand new start. You and your mother pack and catch a coach heading west. It feels weird leaving Klyton.\n\n\n\nEventually after a couple days the coach stops in Teckleville. Which is just one of the many small villages on the borders of the Dalantium Kingdom. Probably in time it’ll get absorbed like so many others do, but that’s not really a concern of yours right now.\n\n\n\nYour aunt Enora is happy to see you both, and while this whole living with her thing was sprung on her at the last moment it doesn’t seem to bother her. She says there’s plenty of room and you can stay as long as you like.\n\n\n\nWhile the house is certainly nice and you’re happy to live there rather than in the street, it’s sort of on the small side. Teckleville isn’t anything like you’re used to, but it isn’t unwelcome. You just aren’t sure what you’re going to do here.\n\n\n\nIn time, your mother works at the local tavern where she serves as a cook. It’s not much, but it is something she’s used to doing.\n\n\n\nYou manage to get a job working as an assistant to the old librarian that works here. Not many use it, so she’s happy to get some company. You aren’t unfond of the job since you get to read a lot of books, some of which you’re a bit surprised to find in a small town like this. The librarian mentions that she tends to get a few of wandering adventurers once in awhile that give books to her that they’ve found in whatever dungeons they’ve been delving into.\n\n\n\n“If it isn’t a spell book, they usually sell it for a few coppers. I believe they’d probably just leave the books wherever they found them most of the time, but you know those adventuring types, they’re all a bunch of closet kleptos that absolutely HAVE to take everything that isn’t nailed down.” She says.\n\n\n\nFor awhile you live at your aunt’s house you manage to save what little money you do make and move out. You briefly think about going to the Delantium Kingdom, but you become attached to Teckleville and stay.\n\n\n\nAs time goes on you take over as the head librarian, get married and have a family. You live the remainder of your life in Teckleville never regretting your decision and die with sense of fulfillment despite never going back to pursue medicine.\n\n\n\nThere were times though; you always wondered what would’ve happened had you stayed to run the inn?\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 90": "You tell Edmond that you think that you’ll take his approach and wait it out. If he wants to do anything against Frank, well you won’t have anything to do with it. Edmond nods and remarks that perhaps it’s best you don’t get yourself into this game since it’s slippery slope that you’re libel to get yourself in a lot more trouble that you wouldn’t be equipped to handle.\n\n\n\nBefore you leave he trusts that you won’t be speaking to anyone about your meeting, because if anyone finds out, it won’t matter how many militia buddies you have. You assure him that you remember his pet lizard and that it won’t be a problem.\n\n\n\nYou’re able to get a coach back to inn, naturally it’s a lot later now and everyone is asking you where you’ve been. You explain that you forgot to do something at campus for a class, which seems to satisfy as an excuse.\n\n\n\nSo you wait and time passes.\n\n\n\nYou continue to wait and more time passes.\n\n\n\nSix months pass and nothing has changed with the Flying Griffon except they continue to do better than your inn and at this point you’re just breaking even. Frank must have his demon girls under control because he’s still doing well and Klyton militia isn’t investigating him.\n\n\n\nYou wonder if you should take Edmond up on his offer, but then perhaps he’s already tried to kill them and his assassin failed. You also ponder if you should report Frank again, but you shake your head. It’s pointless now. You’re losing a war that can’t be won and you’re ready to throw in the towel. Everyone working here isn’t happy anymore, and you never wanted to do this job anyway. You wanted to go into medicine.\n\n\n\nYou approach your mother about selling the inn and she agrees. She apologizes that this inn ultimately became a burden on you, so she says when she sells the place she’ll give you all the money in the hopes that it will help with your education.\n\n\n\nIronically your mother ends up selling the inn to Frank. She says he was smug the whole time but was willing to pay much more than the city would. It’s a lot, but not enough to finish proper medical school. She wishes you well before leaving Klyton for Teckleville and tells you that you’ll always be welcome at Enora’s house where she will be living.\n\n\n\nYou decide maybe while you can’t be a doctor, maybe you can still choose something in medical field, presumably something you’ll be able to afford and not be as stressed all the time.\n\n\n\nYou ultimately become a veterinarian and feel a great sense of accomplishment. The only problem is they aren’t in great demand in Klyton and the few that do exist in the city have the market pretty much cornered, but you do know of a place where they might need one…\n\n\n\nYou move to Teckleville where you make a living treating farm animals and pets like kitties and puppies. Occasionally someone has something more exotic like a purple tailed glittermane, but it’s a quiet life for the most part. You eventually have a family and live the rest of your days there.\n\n\n\nSometimes you wonder what would’ve happened if you’d done things a bit differently at the inn, but all things considered it worked out.\n",
  "page 92": "You decide to tell Edmond that you think that you’ll wait it out.

You explain that you forgot to do something at campus for a class, which seems to satisfy as an excuse.\n\n\n\nYou are a little nervous now about reporting this to the militia after Edmond’s threat, but you figure as long as you keep his name out of it, you’ll be fine. You walk over to one the tables where several militiamen are drinking. Their leader, Sergeant Keller greets you and asks if Wendy’s coming back to the table soon. You aren’t sure how to approach this so you just explain the situation while omitting the way you came about the information. Keller of course is skeptical and naturally asks you how you know this. After dodging several questions, Keller realizes he isn’t going to get anymore information from you.\n\n\n\n“Alright, something shady is going on here…however if you’re serious about these demons at the Flying Griffon, I suppose it can’t hurt to check it out. We’re not doing this favor for free though. Fifty silvers.”\n\n“What!?”\n\n“Hey while I’d love to just harass people on a daily basis I really can’t go around abusing his position like that, at least not without a little incentive.”\n\n“(Sigh) Yeah, yeah I get it, everyone’s gotta get paid. Fine, let me get it from the back, but you better shut Frank down.”\n\n“Oh don’t worry about that. Tomorrow we’ll check the place out and if anything is out of the ordinary, we’ll handle it. If Frank turns out to be an unlicensed mage we’ll run him in, demons or not.”\n\n\n\nYou pay Keller, feel a little better about handling it this way and go about your business for the rest of the night.\n\n\n\nThe next day you get out of class you’re about to board a coach to take you to the inn, but two militiamen stop you.\n\n\n\n“Sir, you need to come with us.”\n\n“What? What did I do?”\n\n“Just come with us quickly. Sergeant Keller wants to see you.”\n\n\n\nNot wishing to cause a scene you board a different coach with the militiamen. You continue to ask them questions, but they say they don’t have any answers. All they know is that they were sent to get you and that you’ll have to speak to their Sergeant about everything.\n\n\n\nYou get very nervous when the coach passes several barracks and through the Klyton south gate. Eventually it stops miles away from Klyton and the militiamen tell you to get out.\n\n\n\n“What’s going on? What are we doing out of Klyton? Hey!”\n\n\n\nThe two men at this point grab you and roughly throw you out of the carriage. You pick yourself up as quickly as you can and find yourself in front of Sergeant Keller.\n\n\n\n“You should’ve left well enough alone, college boy.” Keller says.\n\n“What the hell’s going on? Did Frank put you up to this?”\n\n“Don’t know what you’re talking about, but what I do know is you need to leave Klyton now.”\n\n“What?! But…look, you need to tell me what happened. Did you find the demons at Frank’s or…”\n\n“Don’t know what you’re talking about and you need to just shut the fuck up and be thankful you’re alive. Now I suggest you go far far away and don’t think about entering Klyton for any reason. Come on let’s go men.” Keller says pushing you aside and heading to the coach.\n\n\n\nYou stand in disbelief as they leave you stranded in the wilderness.\n\n\n\nIt’s obvious something has happened to Keller and probably some of his men. You can only guess that Frank or his demon girls have had something to do with this. The problem is that you can’t really do anything about it. Keller probably already has told his subordinates to capture you if they see you in the city and will probably report you to his superiors as well.\n\n\n\nThe only thing you can think of to do is to head to Teckleville where your aunt Enora lives and send a message to your mom what has happened from there. Of course walking there is a long way from where your current location. They dropped you off practically on the border of elven/sotakan territory which is not a good place to be even if you’re a member of one their savage races let alone an outsider like yourself.\n\n\n\nYou decide the safest course of action is to follow the road back to Klyton and then skirt around it’s edges until you reach the road that will lead to Teckleville. With luck you’ll run across some friendly adventurers or something.\n\n\n\nAs you walk you think about your future and how your plans are now severely altered. Your mom is going to be worried until she hears from you and she’ll probably sell the inn, which is just as well since it’ll no doubt be losing money now. You won’t get to complete your schooling; you won’t get to achieve lots of things really.\n\n\n\nShortly after nightfall you begin to tire from all the walking and try to find a place to rest. Following the road might be slightly safer than wandering the wilderness, but highwaymen and ruthless bandits love the roads.\n\n\n\nA couple of them find you asleep and violently wake you up with a knife to your chest. You gasp one last breath before sleeping forever.\n",
  "page 51": "While you hate to be uncompromising dick, you need to stand your ground on this situation. Even if Wendy does get her kids in line, who is to say they won’t relapse later. Really you’ve got more important things to worry about than some little brats that aren’t even yours.\n\n\n\n“Sorry Wendy, it’ll just be better in the long run if you don’t live here anymore.”\n\n\n\nOnce again Wendy is a little shocked that you wouldn’t budge. She quickly gets over it though.\n\n\n\n“Yeah, whatever. Since we’re done here, I’ve got work to do.” She says pushing you aside.\n\n\n\nA week passes and Wendy has already found a new place and moved out. You half expect her to also quit since you know she’s still pissed at you, but she doesn’t. Perhaps she might know this is for the best even if she isn’t going to let you know about it.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime you’re worried more about your future schooling. Even with cutting back on the food, you’re still understaffed and thanks to recent events, Wendy isn’t quite as “enthusiastic” about her job anymore.\n\n\n\nYou just need to hold out a little longer. You figure if you can pass the remainder of your classes this year, you should be able to get a job working as an intern at the hospital while you finish your medical schooling. While that won’t pay that well, you can sell the inn and live off that for quite awhile especially if you get a cheap apartment, maybe even a roommate.\n\n\n\nAll great plans, but it would help if you could get the backing from one of your professors. It’s possible that one of them could really help you out if you explained your situation. You can think of two that might help you.\n\n\n\nYou advanced microbiology teacher, professor Gossey has always been a friendly sort and you know for a fact that she hasn’t had a problem helping out her students in the past.\n\n\n\nYour advanced anatomy \u0026 physiology teacher, professor Kovas isn’t as friendly, but he’s always made a point of praising the work you turn in.\n",
  "page 95": "You decide it would be best to do this quickly as possible. You’re sure that you can improvise if needed.\n\n\n\n“Better go to the warehouse, I don’t want to leave Edmond in the state he’s in any longer than necessary.”\n\n“Sounds good, but you’re coming with me, it’ll go even faster if you’re there to point out stuff you need.” Reg says.\n\n“Uh… okay.” You reply not expecting to leave with Reg.\n\n\n\nYou and Reg take the carriage and soon you’re at the warehouse where a couple of goons let you in.\n\n\n\n“Okay, the medical shit is over here, let’s get it and go.”\n\n\n\nYou tell Reg to find the obvious things like syringes and bandages while you try to look for the pharmaceuticals. You’re having a hard time though and look for a good twenty minutes before Reg gets impatient.\n\n\n\n“Come on, what’s taking so fucking long?”\n\n“I can’t find any antibiotics or anything like that. I need that stuff to make sure he doesn’t die of an infection even after I sew him back up. The fact that this place has really bad lighting doesn’t make it any easier.”\n\n“Look, worry about that later. Grab some of that stuff when you’re at work tomorrow and come back here. Right now though the primary concern is stopping the bleeding and getting him patched up! He’s tough he’s not going to die overnight of some infection.”\n\n\n\nNot necessarily true, as you’ve seen it happen before, but there’s little you can do about it now. You just hope Edmond’s constitution is as good as Reg claims.\n\n\n\nJust as you’re about to leave a couple of gunshots are heard followed by the death yelps of several men.\n\n\n\n“Oh shit! It’s a hit!” Reg shouts scrambling for his flintlock pistol, while the sounds of several footsteps enter the building.\n\n\n\nYou start to panic and look for another exit, but it’s hard to see in this darkness, so you fumble around trying to stay hidden. A couple more gunshots are heard followed by the slumping of a couple of bodies.\n\n\n\n“Argh shit!!” you hear Reg shout. This is followed by a set of running footsteps and the sound of a sword hitting something. You don’t hear Reg anymore.\n\n\n\nYou creep behind a bunch of boxes hoping that you’re not found, but it doesn’t work. A hand suddenly grabs you and turns you around.\n\n\n\n“There you are doc. I really wish this could’ve been different, I really do. But it’s time for a change in this organization and you’re just another casualty of war, nothing personal.” Hans says and stabs you repeatedly in the chest until you’re no longer breathing.\n",
  "page 50": " \n\nYou figure you’ve made your point and she’s still vital to the inn, so you can give her this chance. Besides if she doesn’t get her kids in line then she’s out.\n\n\n\n“Alright Wendy, but don’t stop looking for other places to move to, because I’m not optimistic about your chances.”\n\n“Don’t worry about it, I can handle it.”\n\n“Okay then I hope you prove me wrong.”\n\n\n\nAfter this exchange you and Wendy go back to work.\n\n\n\nA few weeks pass and you notice a decrease in the bad behavior from her kids. Carl’s not grabbing Rita’s ass, Annie’s not cussing out the adventurers and Henry…well he’s still creepy, but he isn’t setting any of your employees on fire and you haven’t tripped over any new cat heads in the alley.\n\n\n\nBy the last week it actually looks like Wendy has succeeded. You’re a little impressed considering how horrible her kids were; still you don’t want a setback.\n\n\n\n“Okay Wendy you can stay, but I hope you know that they better continue acting like how they are now. If there’s a relapse, it’s back to finding a new place again.”\n\n\n\nWendy of course tells you that she has everything under control with her kids now. Unfortunately after a month you find that she doesn’t. Even worse, she isn’t the only person looking for a new place.\n\n\n\nApparently Henry couldn’t contain himself any longer and one night decided to finish what he started with poor Alan by setting more than just his foot on fire. Alan’s flailing soon set portions of the basement on fire, and your stills just make things explosively worse.\n\n\n\nThe first explosion wakes you up immediately. The smell of smoke and the sounds of your inn collapsing on itself gets your ass out of bed and running to the nearest exit. You don’t even have time to check on Wendy before the floor suddenly collapses on you and plunge to a fiery death.\n",
  "page 94": "A few years have passed and your medical schooling is complete and you now work at the Klyton hospital as a real doctor. You haven’t been able to really enjoy your success though.\n\n\n\nSure, you have your own apartment and you make a decent living to afford the things you want, but you’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop and Edmond is going to call in that favor. It’s prevented you from even having a serious relationship for fear that whomever you’re with could possibly be hurt if things get…complex.\n\n\n\nOf course there’s also your mother to worry about still, but from what you know she’s planning on selling the old inn and moving to Teckleville. Hopefully soon, so it’ll at least keep her somewhat out of potential harm.\n\n\n\nUltimately you try to keep yourself busy with work hoping it will keep your mind off things, but it doesn’t help. Eventually you do come up with something that does help a bit. Alcohol.\n\n\n\nIt’s amazing that you grew up in a place that sells the stuff and never had a drink until now. You have to say, it’s not bad and it seems to calm you a bit when you’re feeling anxious. Through this crutch you finally manage to cope.\n\n\n\nWell at least until the fateful day does arrive…\n\n\n\nOne night when you’re coming home from the hospital and carriage pulls up next to you.\n\n\n\n“Hey doc, I think we have a friend in common.” A voice says from the inside of the carriage.\n\n“Let me guess, Edmond. Right?” you reply.\n\n“Correct. I think you know what comes next doc.”\n\n“Yeah, I do.” You say and get into the carriage.\n\n\n\nYou sit down on one side while sitting opposite of you is one man dressed in a cheap suit smoking pipe weed. The other one is dressed more casually and openly playing with a dagger. The pipe man lights up and speaks.\n\n\n\n“Before we get started, my name’s Hans and this is my brother Wallace. Now that that’s over with, Edmond is personally in need of your medical services.”\n\n“I figured it was something like that. What happened to him?\n\n“Oh what usually happens to our kind in this business. There was a disagreement, some words were exchanged and before you know it, some people get hurt while others aren’t so lucky.”\n\n“I…see. So I take it we’re heading to him right now?”\n\n“Yes. He’s a little paranoid about going to hospitals especially with the attempt on his life and all.”\n\n“Hey, doesn’t he already have a doctor?”\n\n“He did, but unfortunately his over indulgence of the spirits made his skills useless and he was…sent away a long time ago.”\n\n“Oh…”\n\n\n\nThe rest of the trip is mostly in silence. Hans asks a few superficial things about you which you give quick answer to, but your mind is focused more on what you’re going to encounter when you get to Edmond. How bad is he going to be? What happens if you can’t help him? By the gods you could use a drink right now.\n\n\n\nYou then think to yourself. “Maybe this is why his old doctor was a drunk.”\n\n\n\nEventually you arrive at the Troll’s Breath Tavern. When you enter the place it’s completely empty save for a few rough looking sorts who look like they’re focused on cleaning up the place. You notice broken glass and a few blood spots here and there.\n\n\n\n“Is that the doc?” one of them asks Hans.\n\n“Yeah, is Ed still in his office?”\n\n“Yeah, and his pet lizard is guarding him like a fucking dragon. Ed’s not letting anyone in there except the doctor.”\n\n“Hm, well I guess you better get in there then. Don’t worry. You’re probably safer than the rest of us right now.”\n\n\n\nYou don’t share that sentiment, but you have little choice in the matter. You head to Edmond’s office and knock on the door.\n\n\n\n“Who the fuck is it? That better be the doc!”\n\n“Yeah, it’s me. I’m coming in.”\n\n\n\nYou cautiously enter and see a great deal of blood on the floor. Edmond is clutching on to his left side and his Sotakan assassin is standing close by staring directly at you. A bottle whiskey is also nearby probably being used to dull his pain and as a disinfectant.\n\n\n\n“Well, don’t just stand there, I gotta fucking hole in my side!”\n\n\n\nYou quickly inspect the wound and see that Edmond’s been shot most likely by a blunderbuss and he’s still got fragments of the shot in his body.\n\n\n\n“Okay, keep the pressure on it like you’ve been doing. I can fix this, but I need to act fast and I’m gonna need some stuff from the hospital.” You say.\n\n“What?! You mean those idiots didn’t have you pick up any supplies?”\n\n“No, they told me to just get into the carriage.”\n\n“Fucking morons. It’s like they want me to die! Okay look, we got access to some hospital supplies in a warehouse much closer than the hospital. Just tell Reg outside what you need and he’ll get them for you. Go, go.”\n\n\n\nYou leave the office and ask for Reg, who comes up immediately.\n\n\n\n“What’s up? Will he live?”\n\n“Yeah, but I’ll need some medical supplies. He said you can get them from one of your warehouses. Now I need…”\n\n\n\nBefore you can finish Hans interjects.\n\n\n\n“Reg, you realize we sold most of those supplies to that bodylegger a few weeks ago? We don’t have much left.”\n\n“We don’t? Well what do we have left?” Reg asks.\n\n“I dunno, I don’t have the supply list in front of me now do I? But what if you get there and find that what the doc asked for isn’t there? We’ve wasted valuable time fucking around while the boss bleeds to death! Look why don’t we just take the doctor back to the hospital, I’m sure we can get everything there right?”\n\n“Well yeah, but Edmond said…”\n\n“I’m sure Edmond won’t mind if disobey his orders if it’s going to save his life.”\n\n\n\nWell this certainly stressful. If the warehouse is lacking supplies, you might not be able to help Edmond. If you go back to the hospital you might take too much time since it’s not just the trip back and forth but it’s the sneaking around stealing medical supplies.\n",
  "page 53": " \n\nAfter her class you approach Dr. Gossey about your situation, she of course is sympathetic.\n\n\n\n“Yes, yes, I understand. It must be hard for you, running a business like that and attending school, let alone paying for it all. I’m not exactly sure how I can help though, I have hired all the student assistants I need and I doubt if you would have the time for it anyway.”\n\n“Isn’t there something I could help with, I dunno like an experimental project I could participate in or something?”\n\n“Ha ha! No, I’m not Dr. Kovas…but now that I’m thinking about it I may have something. You are aware that my other specialty is zoology right?”\n\n“Yes, I know, you’ve even discovered some new species in the past.”\n\n“Ah back when I was younger and more adventurous. Nowadays I tend to hire adventurers to explore for me to find strange and new beasts.”\n\n“Wait, you don’t want me to go seeking new creatures do you?”\n\n“Oh no, again you wouldn’t have the time and you could get killed without the right equipment and proper training for such a thing. However, you do own that inn of yours do you not?”\n\n“Yes, I own it.”\n\n“Good, now I’m going to let you know something that few other do and you must swear that you will NOT mention this to anyone else on campus especially staff!”\n\n“I won’t.”\n\nI have funded an expedition to the Sotakan swamps south of here. Naturally this was incredibly dangerous for several reasons, but most of which is the capture of the elusive daquala. I’m sure you’ve heard the stories of the beast.”\n\n“Stories, I’ve heard it’s more legendary than anything. Don’t the Sotakans revere it as the living embodiment of one of their gods?”\n\n“Something like that, anyway the university wasn’t too keen on this expedition and refused to help, so I had to use my own funds. I’ve gotten word that the adventurers I hired have succeeded in their quest, but I just need some place to keep the beast for awhile before I can clear everything with the university like potentially dangerous wildlife, rogue funding, ignoring safety measures, and the rest of usual red tape shit. Your inn would be a good safe place to keep it I think and I’d certainly pay you well for your trouble, plus you’d make money on the adventurers I hired who will stay there.”\n\n\n\nThis information is a little overwhelming and you have several questions.\n\n\n\n“Okay, first of all how dangerous is this creature? I mean how do you know they got it? I thought it was more of a scary myth than anything else.”\n\n“I know they got it, because after I received a message from the adventurers that they had succeeded, I took a trip last week just outside the Elven-Sotakan warzone to see it for myself and the creature in question fits all the common descriptions of a daquala, as well as some of the more fantastic descriptions. The only reason why I didn’t bring it with me is because I’m trying to keep this as quiet as possible and I can’t be seen with this creature until I clear it with the university first. Plus I knew I was going to have to figure out a way to indirectly bribe the Klyton Milita not to ask any questions when this group brings the beast through. As for how dangerous the daquala is, well apparently it killed one of them, but if you’re worried that this is some hulking monster, it isn’t. It’s about the size of a small dog. It isn’t even that noisy and spends most of its time camouflaged and sleeping. The adventurers I hired will still be looking after it while they stay at the inn, so you shouldn’t worry at all.”\n\n\n\nThis all still sounds a bit dangerous to you, but after asking exactly how much money Dr. Gossey is going to offer you for this task, you really can’t refuse. You agree and Dr. Gossey thanks you and gives you the names and descriptions of the adventurers who will be arriving to your inn in a few days.\n\n\n\nYou spend the time in between preparing your best rooms and keeping them unoccupied in preparation for the adventurers. This causes a few questions from your staff who notice you’re turning people away from staying here, but you just tell them that you’ve got some special guests coming who are going to be spending a lot more money.\n\n\n\nEventually one of the adventurers arrives. He’s a wiry man with a goatee and wearing leather armor with a couple of flintlock pistols strapped to his sides.\n\n\n\n“You must be Hanon.”\n\n“And you must be the inn keeper. I trust you have our rooms ready?”\n\n“Yes, four of you right?”\n\n“Two actually, used to be six at one time, but more loot for the rest of us I suppose. I’m guessing you have a cellar where we can keep the beast?”\n\n“I have a cellar, but I was told you’d be keeping with you.”\n\n“Oh no, we’re not spending anymore time with that fucking thing! It might not live up to the legends, but it’s dangerous enough.”\n\n\n\nYou’re more than a little worried now.\n\n\n\n“Uh…should I even be keeping it here?”\n\n“Probably not, but I’m guessing that Gossey’s paying a lot so you’re willing to risk it. (Sigh) Look, we’ve got the creature locked up in a mithril cage with three spell wards on it, it’s not going anywhere, but we’re just sick of damn thing and all the trouble we’ve had to go through to capture it ALIVE. The little bastard seems calmer in the darkness, so I figure your cellar will be a good place to keep it while we wait. I’ll check on it twice a day, it’ll be fine.”\n\n\n\nThis is all starting to sound a little more complicated, but again you don’t have much choice. You’re going to have to get Alan out of the cellar though and you’ll have to make sure none of the girls get any drinks from there.\n\n\n\n“Okay, I guess bring it on in then, go around the back though, it’ll attract less attention.”\n\n\n\nHanon nods and heads outside, and you quickly go get Alan to explain to him that you need him to sleep in one of the rooms you originally set aside for the adventurers. He doesn’t quite understand why, but he obeys your orders to not go into the cellar for a while.\n\n\n\nYou open up the backdoor and see Hanon and a very large man carrying a cage with a black cloth over it. He must be Benjamin. After a walk short walk, you pick an unused part of the cellar to place the daquala. No sounds have come from the cage at all.\n\n\n\n“Is it alive?” you ask.\n\n“Yeah, it’s alive, it just sleeps a lot. Good thing too, because it’s quite vicious when awake. I’ll have to feed it in a few hours though…hey I see you got your own brewery here.” Hanon says looking over at your stills. You didn’t even think about that when you brought them down here.\n\n\n\n“Oh yeah, that…uh I trust you won’t tell anyone.”\n\n“Bah, if we’re keeping this daquala situation quiet, you certainly don’t have anything to worry about. Okay I think Ben and I are heading up to our rooms, it’s been a damn long trip and actually sleeping in a bed instead of the fucking wilderness for once will make a nice change.”\n\n\n\nAs Hanon and Benjamin head up to their rooms you immediately call the rest of your staff to tell them to not go into the cellar for awhile and if they need to refill the alcohol, you’ll do it. While this creates less work for them, they’re getting curious about what is going on. After all they’re seeing adventurers come out of the cellar, Wendy already noticed the cage being brought into the back of the inn, and the various other changes you’ve been making lately.\n\n\n\nAt this point you figure there might be fewer potential complications if they know what’s going on, so you explain everything.\n\n\n\n“Oh that’s fucking wonderful. You’re using this place as a zoo for dangerous animals now?” Rita says.\n\n“Shhhh! Keep your fucking voice down!” you say.\n\n“How dangerous is this thing? I mean could it get out? I heard stories about the daquala when I was a little girl and they still scare me to this day!” Eliza mentions.\n\n“It won’t get out. Precautions have been taken. Trust me.”\n\n“I sure hope so, because if that thing gets out and attacks one of us…well I don’t think I need to mention how much shit you’ll be in. Did you tell Alan to get the hell out of the cellar yet?” Wendy says.\n\n“Yes, he’ll be staying in one of the rooms upstairs and I told him to not go into the cellar.”\n\n“Hmmm well I guess I’m glad you threw me out of this place when you did, because there’s no way I’d live here with a killer monster in the cellar. Still, you’re putting us all in potential danger so I’d say that entitles us to some hazard pay doesn’t it?”\n\n“Yeah! What Wendy said! Hazard pay!” Rita agrees.\n\n\n\nYou almost wish that they’d just refuse to work at all, but you just sigh heavily and come to a fair agreement on “danger” pay while the daquala is at the inn. You just hope it isn’t too long of a stay since that money that Dr. Gossey is paying you is supposed to go to finishing up your tuition.\n\n\n\nThe next few days go by relatively uneventfully and it’s business as usual. Hanon checks on the daquala periodically to feed and sedate it somehow. You wonder how he’s doing it and he says with magic of course. You have to say that by his look you didn’t think he was a wizard. He and Benjamin spend a fair amount of money in the tavern so it sort of offsets the danger pay you have to give your staff. Everyone stays away from the cellar, except Alan who forgot he wasn’t supposed to go down there, but fortunately Eliza stops him before he got down the stairs.\n\n\n\nAfter a week goes by you ask Dr. Gossey when she’s going to take the thing, but she says she’s still working on the university faculty, as compensation for your patience she gives half of your money now. That’s great and all, but your concern is more of a safety issue now. The magical meat or whatever hell Hanon has been feeding the daquala isn’t keeping it appeased anymore and it’s been more “vocal” lately. Hanon’s also been keeping the magical wards on it for about a month now, and he’s feeling tired all the time now due to the constant drain.\n\n\n\nAnother couple of days and Hanon’s ready to dump the daquala on Dr. Gossey’s doorstep and be done with it. He says he and Ben have gone way beyond what they were paid to do. You sympathize and you want the daquala gone as much as everyone else, but you’re concerned that if he does this, it’s going to fuck up things between you and your professor, not to mention the rest of your money.\n",
  "page 97": "The hospital is probably a better bet. Besides you can get the higher quality stuff there. You doubt if you’ll have that much of a problem getting the supplies too, it isn’t an uncommon thing for a few things to go missing here and there.\n\n\n\n“We better go back to the hospital, I’d rather be on the safe side.”\n\n“Good man, come on we’ll take the carriage back to the hospital, my brother will drive it, he knows all the short cuts in this city and isn’t squeamish about running over dumb fuckers that get in the way.”\n\n“Erm, okay then.” You reply.\n\n“Just be quick about this shit, if you take too fucking long and Edmond dies, you three are going to be joining him!” Reg reminds all of you.\n\n\n\nYou, Hans and Wallace leave the Troll’s Breath Tavern and set out for the hospital. On the way there you make a mental note of what to say if anyone at the hospital asks you any questions and where else in the hospital to search just in case you don’t find what you need right away.\n\n\n\n“Tell me, do you think Edmond is a fair man?” Hans suddenly asks you.\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I said, do you think Edmond is a fair man? Tis not a hard question.”\n\n“Uh, well sure. I mean I had a deal with him in the past and he lived up to it.”\n\n“Yeah, I know all about that so called deal. If it were truly a deal, you and me wouldn’t be having this conversation. I hope you realize this isn’t going to be the last time he calls on you again.”\n\n\n\nYou don’t say anything. You were trying not to dwell on the possibility of such depressing matters.\n\n\n\n“Look friend, I know you. You’d rather not have to live your life being connected to the underworld, but you were in a tight spot, so you resorted to desperate measures. Sort of like your father no?”\n\n“Yeah…I guess so…” you answer not really thinking of that parallel before.\n\n“Well, I sympathize. Trust me I do. I mean I know what it’s like to get so far deep into something that you don’t know how you’re ever going to get out. Hell, I never intended to be part of the Crimson Talons, but I had to do it not just for my survival but my brother’s as well.”\n\n\n\nYou say nothing and wait for Hans to get to the point he’s going to make.\n\n\n\n“What I’m saying is, you don’t NEED to have this hanging over your head forever. You could end it tonight.”\n\n“Hold on, if we’re talking about what I think we are, you heard Reg, he said if we took too long he’d have us all killed.”\n\n“I didn’t suggest that. I mean that hospital surely has a bunch of things that shouldn’t be used in excessive dosages.”\n\n“You want me to kill him? I can’t do that, I’d get killed by that Sotakan! If not immediately then certainly soon after he suspected that I had something to do with his death!”\n\n“Well I figured that you’d be a little creative in that area. Perhaps give him something for the pain. Something that creates a plausible tale that the man just died in his sleep. It’s not like that lizard is really going to put two and two together. It’s not the brightest thing; it’s just really good at following orders and killing people. I wouldn’t worry about it anyway. The lizard will be taken care of soon. And you needn’t worry about anyone else potentially retaliating either, Edmond’s never been too popular and what few loyal cronies he has other than the lizard will also be dealt with.”\n\n\n\nYou bury your hands in your head at the thought of all this and how you got here in the first place. If you go through with this, you won’t just be an accomplice the murder anymore, but a full blown one. You think about the irony of being a doctor. You’re supposed to be keeping people alive not killing them.\n\n\n\n“Look, I know this is all a lot to take in, but just think. If you do this, you’re free. Free to go about the rest of your life as you see fit. And getting rid of Edmond would be a favor to everyone; he’s an evil bastard. Now I’m not saying I’m a saint, but the man is unnecessarily brutal. I’d at least try to put an end to some of the random violence that goes on in the organization and get back to focusing on business. Hell, I’ve got even a long-term plan of trying to make the organization legit one day. Like I said, I didn’t really want this life, but it was survival at the time.”\n\n\n\nIf Hans is trying to identify with you on some level to get you to help him, it’s working, because you’re starting to seriously consider going through with this plan.\n\n\n\nEventually you get to the hospital and you tell Hans you’ll be out as soon as possible. It’s the graveyard shift so you don’t run into too many people you know that ask questions. In fact nobody really pays too much attention to you at all, but you decide to play it safe and head down to the supply room in the basement to take what you need.\n\n\n\nAfter grabbing a few syringes, disinfectants, bandages and the like, you break the lock of the cabinet with the pharmaceutical supplies. You grab the pain killers immediately, but then you look for something that might help you with the other problem.\n\n\n\n“Incitahol? What the hell?” you say to yourself, picking up the small vial. This stuff shouldn’t even be mixed in with the regular drugs. It’s a powerful experimental concoction! It was supposed to be a “miracle” drug that increased the body’s natural healing ability even greater than that of mountain trolls and was first used on dying patients. Unfortunately what the drug really did was the speed up the death process and bring them back as zombies. It was banned by most civilized places and is highly sought out by lazy necromancers who don’t have the natural ability to raise hordes of undead.\n\n\n\nYou’d worry more about finding this if you didn’t have your own drama going on right now. In fact this would probably be the perfect thing to take with you. Incitahol doesn’t cause pain and quickly puts the patient into a coma and death follows soon after. (And then it’s zombie time) You’ll have to explain some of this to Hans though so he’s prepared.\n\n\n\nPart of you wonders if you should really go through with all this though. There’s no guarantee that Hans is telling you the truth and you might be just trading one master for another. In fact he might just blame you for everything and have you killed when he takes power.\n\n\n\nOf course another way to handle this is to inject this stuff into Edmond and not tell him what’s going to happen. Chances are undead Ed might kill everyone nearby. Incitahol does increase the reflexes and strength after death making for a rather lively zombie. The problem is this is a very risky endeavor not to mention severely irresponsible.\n",
  "page 21": "“Do you think you’d still be able to get a good price for this place?” you ask your mother.\n\n“Yeah, but not before next payment! That’s why we just need to get out of the city now!”\n\n\n\nYou grab what payment you can afford and start heading for the door.\n\n\n\n“What’re you doing?!”\n\n“I’m going to see Mr. Reynolds early.”\n\n“What?! You can’t! He’ll kill you!”\n\n“No, he’ll have me beaten. Look, if we leave he’s just going to track us down and he probably will kill us by that time.

Afterwards, well we’ll see what happens.”\n\n\n\nYour mother still doesn’t want you to go, but you’re determined so she doesn’t stand in your way.

I guarantee the next one will be much bigger.” You say plopping the bag of coins on his desk.\n\n\n\nHe lifts the bag and frowns at its weight.\n\n“Feels a little light kid. You do realize what’s going to happen next right?”\n\n“Yes, that’s why I came early to get it over with.” You say trying to sound brave.\n\n“Heh, you’re trying your best to be brave, but I know deep down inside you’re terrified. It’s okay, you should be. (Sigh) Olaf. Reggie. Just beat him up, don’t break any bones, I’m in a good mood today.”\n\n\n\nOlaf approaches you with a little disappointment that he doesn’t get to break any bones today, but he still takes glee in punching you in the face. Reggie picks you up and holds you while Olaf beats on you some more. You try not to think about the pain, but instead try to think about how it’s absolutely amazing that Olaf manages to pull his punches enough that he doesn’t break anything. It’s the odd ogre that can show restraint during violence.\n\n\n\nOlaf does fail eventually though, when everyone hears an awful crunch sound and blood flies everywhere from your nose which is now completely broken.\n\n\n\n“Oh Olaf, I told you not to break anything! All right he’s had enough, drop him Reggie.” Mr. Reynolds orders and steps from his behind his desk to speak to you.\n\n\n\n“That’s two times I’ve been lenient kid. Next time, well for your sake there better not be a fucking next time because you’re not exactly the hardy type to take beatings like this. Olaf carry this kid back to his inn, he can’t make it home in his condition.”\n\n\n\nYou don’t even remember what happens in the next few moments since you’re drifting in and out of consciousness. When Olaf arrives at the inn he dumps your limp body inside and walks off. Your mother makes sure you’re still alive and somehow manages to get you to crawl to the bed of one of the empty rooms.\n\n\n\nDuring the remaining week the inn stays open to make a last bit of change before closing for good and selling to the city. Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn’t like how it used to be anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren’t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother finds work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can’t really stand living in the city without your father anymore. She leaves to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville, which is to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAfter a long time of the inn just sitting untended and forgotten due to the council having more pressing matters and red tape, it’s broken into by several homeless people who use it as a place to sleep. The homeless are soon ousted by a local gang who use it as a safe house. Eventually though they cause enough trouble that the Klyton Militia has to take severe action and storm the place, resulting in a small fire.\n\n\n\nAt this point someone in the council finally notices it, decides that the place isn’t worth salvaging and proposes that it be knocked down to build a medical clinic in its place to try to uplift the area. The motion passes.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you find a job thanks to your education level, but it isn’t anywhere in the field that you would’ve liked.

You never really move up and you never make enough money to save away to get ahead either.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have a bad life so much as a mind numbingly mundane one. You do have your good days, but ultimately you never really achieve your goals and always have a sense of dissatisfaction with your life.\n\n\n\nSometimes you look back and wonder where you exactly went wrong with the inn and how you could’ve done things differently.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 65": "After a long period of introspection, you realize your choices haven’t really gotten you anywhere good. You’ve alienated your mother by breaking the law. You continued to break the law while in possession of the inn and your staff grew to dislike you and you don’t even own the place anymore. You moved on to being an accessory to murder in illegal experiments for monetary gain and your own obsession to go to medical school.\n\n\n\nYou’ve managed to get away with it all so far, but for how much longer? Are you going to end up like Dr. Kovas and be a misanthropic asshole hated by your colleagues by day and be a completely batshit insane madman by night? You know you aren’t a “good guy” after all the shit you’ve been doing, but you figure you can do something to at least keep from getting worse.\n\n\n\nSo it’s decided, you leave Klyton with no fanfare. You aren’t particularly worried about Dr. Kovas. Most likely he’ll just curse you for being a “weakling bound by pangs of morality” but that’s about it.\n\n\n\nYou end up going to Teckleville where your mom is surprised to see you. You make up with her and apologize for what happened between the both of you. You of course don’t let her know about all the stuff you did while assisting Dr. Kovas.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou live with her for a while and try to figure out what you’re going to do with your life and eventually you get a job as a teacher at the high school in town where your extensive knowledge on the sciences comes in quite handy and greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nFor several years you live a fairly mundane life. It’s even a little boring at times, but you don’t mind it. You may have lived out the rest of your days in Teckleville if things had gone right, but as they say, there ain’t no rest for the wicked.\n\n\n\nWhile you were building a new life in Teckleville, Dr. Kovas was still continuing his illegal experiments; he also eventually got caught and was arrested for his crimes. He wasn’t in custody for long since he was killed trying to escape. Unfortunately for you, he kept detailed journals about his experiments and your name was mentioned several times in them. (Mostly in hate filled rants after you left)\n\n\n\nOne day while you’re teaching a class, the Klyton militia shows up and you already know what they’re there for.\n\n\n\n“Um, okay class just take out your books and read chapters twelve and thirteen until the bell rings, I have to speak to these men for a moment.” You say and leave with the militia.\n\n\n\nYou are shackled and taken away in a coach. It’s quite the spectacle to the folks witnessing the event. You don’t ask to say goodbye to your mother, you wouldn’t know how to explain this and it would just break her heart again. Granted she’s going to find out eventually anyway, but you don’t have to be the one to face her.\n\n\n\nYour return to Klyton is a short one since you immediately plead guilty to the judge. No sense in drawing it out you think. You spend your last few days in a cell waiting to be hanged, thinking about the mistakes you made and how you’re finally sorry that you didn’t make better choice when you had the chance.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re at the gallows you are asked if you have any last words, but you have none. The lever is pulled, you fall through the hole and the rope snaps your neck instantly.\n",

I mean you think you’re going to find any of the type of men you’re interested in here?”\n\n“So you’re saying I should just settle?”\n\n“No, I’m saying Ular’s a nice guy who’s going to probably try to do everything within his means to make you happy. Now doesn’t that at least sound worthwhile?”\n\n“Yeah I suppose it does…I haven’t really been happy in a long time. Okay, tell him to meet me after work.”\n\n“Okay, and what the hell, you can get off an hour earlier.” You add.\n\n\n\nRita walks off with a slight spring in her step. You look for Ular and see him slowly coming out of his dark corner. You tell him that she’s interested and that she’ll talk with him in greater length after work. He’s ecstatic.

Ular is so happy with her that he routinely buys rounds for the house to celebrate his good fortune.\n\n\n\nMr. Reynolds is satisfied with the payment he receives, and you still have a little saved over. You have high hopes that in time you’ll get out of this debt. However, unexpected troubles arise in the next month.\n\n\n\nUlar stops coming in altogether. Rita has had a great affect on him, namely she doesn’t want him wasting all his money at the inn anymore; she wants him wasting it on her. This might not be too bad, except Rita also quits her job to move into Ular’s home seeing as he makes enough for the pair of them.\n\n\n\nWhile it’s true you don’t have to pay her anymore, you lose a couple of other customers that must’ve liked looking at her. That’s not even counting the extra work that Eliza and Wendy have to do now who are now miserable to the point of wanting to seriously quit. You and your mother take up some of the slack, but it’s a drain on the pair of you.\n\n\n\nThe kicker is when Calwin shows up on his monthly delivery. He says that he’s decided to bump the price up on his alcohol. You furiously ask why, and he says that the last time he was here he noticed how nice the rooms were and that if you can afford to fix them up, you must be able to afford to pay him more for his product.\n\n\n\nYour mother who is already stressed out from overwork, is so disgusted with him that she grabs your dad’s Troll Gun from under the bar counter and points it at him, telling him to get the hell out before she blows his head off. He and his lackeys leave, which means you’ll have no alcohol supply this month. You’ll have to make due with what you have left and go back to the old expensive one.\n\n\n\nThe bigger immediate problem is Mr. Reynold’s payment, which you won’t have enough to give him this time around and it’s going to be that time again in a few more days. Your mother can’t bare to see you get hurt again and suggests forgetting all about the inn and just taking off with all the remaining money you have and going to live with your crazy aunt Enora.\n",

Don’t think you still won’t be working around here though; I’ll still need you during the late shift. Besides I don’t want you wandering around at night, people might get the wrong idea or something.”\n\n“Fine, as long as it gets me out of this place for a little while I’m game.”\n\n“Okay, also I’d like you to try to throw around some insults about the Flying Griffon Inn while you’re making your sales pitch.”\n\n“Got it.”\n\n\n\nThe next day, Rita comes in and while she’s always been a pretty girl, she now looks like a succubus that you’ve heard about from old tales. You try to contain your own desire to shamelessly flirt with her.\n\n\n\n“By the gods Rita, you’re going to have every guy within this area after you.”\n\n“Meh, wouldn’t be the first time. Okay, I’m off, try not to fantasize about me too much while I’m gone.”\n\n\n\nYou’re not exactly sure how to take that, but you are wondering how this will play out for you.\n\n\n\nOver the course of a few days you definitely see a drastic increase in customers, and not just adventurers either. You’ve got Klyton Milita (who usually just drink at their barracks) coming in and even a few humble storeowners. You’re making a lot more money, but it’s a lot of extra work for the rest of you.\n\n\n\nMr. Reynolds receives sizable amounts of money and he continues to be satisfied with your payments. At this rate you’ll probably be able to get out of debt by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nThe only major problems are how overworked the rest of you are getting and how arrogant Rita is getting.\n\n\n\nRita states that she should even have to work as a barmaid anymore because it interferes with her “advertising.”\n\n\n\n“Advertising? You wiggle your ass at horny men! You’re basically a harlot that doesn’t put out…or is there another reason why everyone comes here?” Wendy accuses.\n\n“Figures that you’d be jealous of my popularity. Face it; I do more around here than ANYONE to keep this place successful, and I deserve some credit for it!” Rita demands.\n\n“Hey we all know Rita, but…”\n\n“But nothing, if you expect me to keep working here, I want a raise and I don’t want to be working as some lowly barmaid anymore! I’m above serving food and drinks!”\n\n“So you basically want to be paid to stand around and look pretty? What the hell kind of job title would we even call that?” you ask.\n\n“I dunno, hostess maybe? Yeah, I’d be the hostess!”\n\n“By the gods, this is ridiculous! You can’t seriously be considering this!” Wendy exclaims.\n\n\n\nThe only people who are silent in all this are Eliza who is being her usual quiet self, and your mother who just shrugs and says it’s your call since this was mainly your idea. You get the impression she doesn’t care for Rita’s attitude though.\n",

You explain to him how the conversation went, he’s obviously upset about it, but thanks you nonetheless.\n\n\n\n“Well, I guess it’s true about that old saying. You can’t judge a book by its cover. Give everyone a round for the house on me, everyone else might as well be happy even if I’m not.

We’ll have to make due with what we have left and given how much those miners drinks, we won’t have enough!”\n\n“Well maybe we could water down the drinks or something…” you say trying to think of a solution.\n\n“Water down the drinks? Are you serious? That’s not going to work and we’re going to lose people doing that! Those miners are some serious drinkers, they’re going to know the difference.”\n\n“If you hadn’t chased Calwin out with a gun, I might’ve been able to reason with him. Okay fine, the only other solution I can think of is we’ll have to make our own ale.”\n\n“And how do we do that? I don’t have any experience in doing that and we don’t have license to do it either!”\n\n“I took some chemistry classes, I’m fairly certain I could try to build a still and…”\n\n“And that’s even worse than watering down the drinks. Look, I’m tired just thinking about all this and I’m going to rest before the business hours start.”\n",
  "page 27": " \n\nHe’s got you over a barrel, you agree to his price. Your mother throws up her hands and rolls her eyes in disgust. Calwin smirks and calls his lackeys to take his alcohol into the cellar, while he “retires” to his room again.\n\n\n\nLike last time, Calwin is a lecherous slob and Rita doesn’t have Ular defending her “honor” anymore. This time she quits when Calwin practically molests her when she takes food up to his room.\n\n\n\nDeal or not, your mother isn’t going to put up with his shit any longer, grabs your dad’s Troll Gun from behind the bar and kicks him out of his room. He screams at you saying that you’ll regret reneging on the deal like this before leaving.\n\n\n\nNow you’re a barmaid short and you’ll have to go back to the old Klyton supplier. While it’s true you don’t have to pay Rita anymore, you end up losing a couple of customers that liked looking at her. That’s not even counting the extra work that Eliza and Wendy have to do now who are now miserable to the point of wanting to seriously quit. You and your mother take up some of the slack, but it’s a drain on the pair of you.\n\n\n\nAnd while you have enough to pay Mr. Reynolds this month, you’re not optimistic about the future. The problem is you won’t be saving money like you were going to while Calwin was your supplier. Your nice rooms haven’t really been helping like you thought they might and while you can keep on this way, you’re never really going to get ahead.\n\n\n\nThe thought of continuing to work here any longer is disheartening to you. Maybe you’re just being impatient, but after all the problems and headaches you’ve encountered you really don’t feel like dealing with this job anymore, especially not when there is potential danger constantly looming overhead. You’re ready to tell your mother to just sell the place.\n\n\n\nSo you do.\n\n\n\nYou fought the good fight for as long as you could, but maybe it just wasn’t meant to be. You’re not going to finish this one, which is a familiar theme to you since you dropped out of college. You tell your mother what you think and she seems just as eager to sell the place off too since the past few months have been pretty stressful.\n\n\n\nDuring the remaining week the inn stays open to make a last bit of change before closing for good and selling to the city. Some of the miners seem a little sad by it, but there were so many changes within such a short period of time that most seemed content on finding a new place since the old one wasn’t like how it used to be anymore.\n\n\n\nWhen the inn is sold off, you barely make enough to cover the debt, but at least you and your mother aren’t in any immediate danger now.\n\n\n\nYour mother finds work as a cook for a short time, but eventually decides she can’t really stand living in the city without your father anymore. She leaves to go live with your aunt Enora in Teckleville, which is to the east on the outskirts of the Delantium Kingdom.\n\n\n\nAfter a long time of the inn just sitting untended and forgotten due to the council having more pressing matters and red tape, it’s broken into by several homeless people who use it as a place to sleep. The homeless are soon ousted by a local gang who use it as a safe house. Eventually though they cause enough trouble that the Klyton Militia has to take severe action and storm the place, resulting in a small fire.\n\n\n\nAt this point someone in the council finally notices it, decides that the place isn’t worth salvaging and proposes that it be knocked down to build a medical clinic in its place to try to uplift the area. The motion passes.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you find a job thanks to your education level, but it isn’t anywhere in the field that you would’ve liked. You’re a clerk in tax office, filing away items, straightening out reports and such. You never really move up and you never make enough money to save away to get ahead either.\n\n\n\nYou don’t really have a bad life so much as a mind numbingly mundane one. You do have your good days, but ultimately you never really achieve your goals and always have a sense of dissatisfaction with your life.\n\n\n\nSometimes you look back and wonder where you exactly went wrong with the inn and how you could’ve done things differently.\n\n\n\nYou’ll never know.\n",
  "page 60": "It certainly will be the easiest for you to do emotionally and less likely to get you into trouble with the law. Who’s going to miss a whore right? The only thing you really need to worry about is getting mugged while you’re looking for one.\n\n\n\nYou take a deep breath and catch a coach to the slums of Klyton.\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t take you long to get propositioned several times when you arrive.\n\n\n\n“Hey baby, you like what you see?”\n\n“Mmmm, come put your dick in this slice of paradise!”\n\n“You see these lips? They could be wrapped around your cock.”\n\n“Come over here honey, you ain’t never had goblin ass before!”\n\n\n\nWhile you wince at that last one. A big man approaches you.\n\n\n\n“Hey you, you gonna just look or you actually gonna buy some pussy?”\n\n“Are you their pimp?”\n\n“I’m their manager! Now enough with the questions, you buying or what?”\n\n\n\nYou can’t get a prostitute that has a pimp. If she turns up missing, he’s likely to seek you out and take the loss out on your hide or even blackmail you. You excuse yourself and continue to wander the streets.\n\n\n\nYou travel into an even more destitute area of the slums looking for a whore, which is proving to be a lot harder than you thought it would be. You eventually find what you’re looking for and they’re revolting. The drug whores are certainly out in force tonight.\n\n\n\n“You got some green lotus or yellow devil? I’ll suck your dick!” is what most of the drug whores say to you. You almost figure you’d be doing them a favor by getting them killed. You pick the one who looks least likely to infect you just by breathing on you. (The irony that you’re already infected by a killer toxin isn’t lost on you.)\n\n\n\nYou hand her several gold coins, probably the most money she’s seen in a long time and is ready to take you around the corner and blow you, but you have to explain that you’re heading to some place nicer and warm, with lots of drugs! She seems to like that idea, so she agrees to follow you.\n\n\n\nFortunately you manage to catch another coach relatively quickly and your trip back to the campus is uneventful other than the ramblings and awful coughing of your “lady friend.”\n\n\n\nYou arrive to the lab with your whore in tow and Dr. Kovas pulls you both in all the while not looking impressed.\n\n\n\n“Are you fucking kidding me? You got a whore? I could’ve got a whore!”\n\n“Well why didn’t you?”\n\n“I’d watch your tongue boy if you want that antidote.”\n\n“Look I did what you said! Just cure me now!”\n\n“Not yet, I need you to do one more thing, here.”\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas points you to a syringe on a table filled with something. Something not good no doubt. It’s obvious he wants you to inject the whore with it.\n\n\n\n“No, no, you said all I had to do is bring her here.”\n\n“Yes, well I think under the circumstances you’re ready to take the next step for science.”\n\n“Hey wait, am I doing both of you? That’s okay I guess, but this is extra.” The whore says still not grasping the situation.\n\n\n\nAs for you, you shake your head, knowing it’s useless to argue. You almost feel like grabbing the syringe and running over to stab him with it, but you still need the antidote and then you’d probably have to still kill the whore too.\n\n\n\n“Alright honey, I’m gonna take care of you.” you say holding the syringe and approaching the whore.\n\n“Oooh now that’s what I’m talkin’ about. Shoot me up.”\n\n\n\nYou inject the eager whore with the needle and she soon falls unconscious.\n\n\n\n“Quickly, bring her to the table!”\n\n\n\nWhile you do so, Dr. Kovas disappears to the back of his lab. You check the girl and realize she’s stopped breathing. You’ve killed her, though you’re not really surprised, you’re just hoping that Kovas is coming out with your antidote.\n\n\n\nHe comes out with much more than your antidote, he comes out with a rolling cart filled with several medical instruments that look more like torture devices and tosses you a small vial of clear liquid.\n\n\n\n“Here, take this and put on some gloves. We’re about make history!”\n\n\n\nYou swallow the contents of the vial which you hope is the antidote. You don’t feel any different after taking it though. You half wonder if he was bluffing about poisoning you at all. If that’s the case then you just killed a girl for no reason, though it hardly matters at this point, as mad as you are at Dr. Kovas you might as well go through with this all the way.\n\n\n\nYou stand there for a moment just watching Dr. Kovas enthusiastically cutting into the girl and injecting more strange fluid directly into her vital organs. He doesn’t seem to be paying attention to anything else, until he suddenly stops.\n\n\n\n“Hold on wait, did you strap her down? Shit you didn’t strap her down! Quick, tie her up!”\n\n“What?!” you say not really understanding why you’d need to do it, but you find out when she suddenly comes to life!\n\n\n\n“Tie her feet! Tie her feet!” Dr. Kovas yells as he shackles her arms to the table. You grab the rope on the cart and begin tying her feet, which are twitching as much as she’s making some no longer human noises.\n\n\n\n“Raagh. Gargah! Arrgh!”\n\n\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you what exactly Dr. Kovas is experimenting with, Incitahol. It’s a banned concoction that was supposed to bring the dead back to life and it does, but only to create them as zombies. Lazy wannabe necromancers and mad scientists love the stuff, and would seem you’re working with the latter right now.\n\n\n\n“You’re experimenting with incitahol? This is your big project? I thought you’d be aware that this shit’s only good for creating zombies and not even controllable ones!” you say.\n\n“Ah, not yet anyway! I’ve made some changes to it. If you’ll notice the subject is not as aggressive as it would be under regular incitahol. Unfortunately it was still quite hostile and nearly bit my ear when I was trying to strap it down. I can’t be sure if this due to my changes in the drug, or the fact that this subject’s organs were heavily damaged due to her own major drug use and life style. Probably had several sexual diseases too, who knows what those factors might’ve played. This is why I didn’t want a drug addled whore (sigh) I’ll need a new subject.”\n\n\n\nYou’re a little put off, considering he did say he didn’t care what kind of girl you got. You’re hardly surprised though; you just say you’ll get on it tomorrow.\n\n\n\n“You? No I don’t think so. I think I’m misjudged your abilities considering you’ve been argumentative and an utter failure in bringing me a good test subject. No I do not think there will be anymore chances. You may leave, I’m done with you.”\n\n\n\nNOW you’re surprised and more than a little pissed. This dick has been insulting you, poisoned you, made you kill a girl and now he’s just dismissing you like some flunky without even paying you for your time?\n\n\n\n“Oh is that how it is? Well you still owe me money for this!”\n\n“Owe? I don’t owe you anything. You did this for science m’boy. You should be happy you’re alive so that you can live out the rest of your boring existence.”\n\n\n\nIt’s the last straw, you aren’t going to take it anymore and you snap. You immediately attack Dr. Kovas who anticipates your attack by dodging it. You crash straight into the zombie whore’s table and are unfortunately bit in the arm.\n\n\n\n“Arrrrgh! My arm!” you scream struggling to get your arm out of the zombie whore’s mouth.\n\n“Nargh Gabrah Raagh!”\n\n“Well, I guess you still might have your uses…”\n\n\n\nYou feel a crushing blow to the back of your head and that’s the last thing you experience in your life.\n\n\n\nYour short undead “life” isn’t even worth mentioning.\n",
  "page 62": "You won’t do it, you won’t kill anyone and you’re not going to bring someone to Dr. Kovas for him to murder either. Maybe you’ll die, but you’re going to make sure Kovas pays as well.\n\n\n\nYou head to the nearest Klyton militia station and tell them everything. The sergeant in charge asks if you’ve been to the hospital yet to which you say no. He says they need to get you there immediately and if you do indeed have some sort of poison in your system they’ll obviously be able to arrest Dr. Kovas with no problems.\n\n\n\nYou’re rushed to the hospital and thanks to the militia you’re seen to immediately. The physicians run all sorts of tests on you. They don’t find anything, but given the situation they put you on observation. The militia still goes to check out Dr. Kovas since there are several doctors they speak with at the hospital who don’t particularly like him and don’t put it past him to pull something like this.\n\n\n\nYou wait in your bed, getting more nervous by the hour. You don’t feel sick at all, maybe he was bluffing? You sure hope so. In any case, you realize that maybe you need to give up on the whole medical profession thing. You tried your best, but it seems that events have constantly conspired against you. You’ve even broken laws of your own to achieve your goals and all you’ve managed to succeed in is alienating your mom, earning the loathing of your staff and getting yourself poisoned.\n\n\n\nAfter thinking about this for a while, you begin to get sleepy. It isn’t dawn yet, but you can’t be sure if it isn’t the poison or not, of course it could just be the stress of the night finally getting to you. In any case you close your eyes to darkness.\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up you’re surprised to see your mom sitting there.\n\n\n\n“Oh by the gods, thanks to them you’re alive!”\n\n“Mom? How the? How’d you get here so fast? How did you find out?”\n\n“Son, I think the first thing you should know is that you’ve been in a coma for about a month!”\n\n“Whaaaa…”\n\n\n\nYou mother explains everything that she knows that has happened. You did have a deadly toxin in your body, but fortunately the hospital was able to keep you alive until the militia found the antidote in Kovas’ lab. Dr. Kovas himself was killed while resisting arrest.\n\n\n\nThey injected the antidote into your unconscious body, but they assume it didn’t work like it should have due to the toxin already running through your body and in the process of shutting everything down.\n\n\n\nWhen the militia informed Wendy of your condition, she immediately contacted your mother by messenger. Being your only immediate family, she also regained possession of the inn while you were incapacitated and possibly on your deathbed. As a result she sold it to help pay for your medical treatment and she’s been by your side ever since.\n\n\n\nYou can’t believe that your mom has helped you like this after how you parted a year ago. Needless to say you and her make up in an emotional way.\n\n\n\nYou spend another week in the hospital still getting tested by doctors. They tell you you’ll be able to go home, but your body has been severely weakened by the toxin and how it is unlikely that you’ll ever be fully healthy again.\n\n\n\nNo more inn and no more college and somehow it all just seems like a great relief to you. Your mother takes you to her home in Teckleville, you have no idea what you’re going to do there, but for a while you just take it easy.\n\n\n\nJust like the doctors said, you don’t make a complete recovery. You feel tired all the time and sometimes you don’t feel well at all. You mother and your aunt Enora make sure to look after you, but as the months go on you begin to get frustrated and depressed.\n\n\n\nYou try to occupy your time with hobbies, but nothing really works. You almost consider suicide, but that would probably devastate your mom more than anything, so you take the same determined mindset that you once had for college and place it towards finding a job you’ll be able to handle. Eventually you succeed and get a position at the small library in town where your extensive knowledge on the sciences comes in quite handy and greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nThe rest of your life is fairly mundane, perhaps even a little boring, but you do come to appreciate the life you managed to carve out in light of everything that happened to you.\n",
  "page 64": "You’ve come this far; you might as well go for the gold.\n\n\n\nYou agree to help Dr. Kovas, and continue to “aquire” subjects for him, which you’ve become frighteningly good at. Time goes by and you even indulge in some of the actual killing. You certainly learn just as much from him as you do in “regular class.” In your spare time you do a few experiments of your own on victims you capture. Dr. Kovas doesn’t really approve since its taking time away from what he wants you to be helping him with, and he feels you’re just bumbling around and engaging in sadistic torture for your own twisted pleasure. (To be fair he’s partially right at this point)\n\n\n\nAs for his experiments, you still don’t see him making any more progress. He has managed to get the zombies to be relatively docile with training, but they’re still relatively mindless. He’s a scientifically minded necromancer at this point, but he’s not even doing anything that useful with it. He keeps saying that he WILL succeed in bringing a being back to life fully intact without the zombification element, but it doesn’t seem possible. Not even the old school magicians of legend could do that. Once the brain is completely dead, it’s dead! Even through his verbal abuse you still used to respect Dr. Kovas for his dedication and his knowledge, but lately he’s just been looking like a crazy old fool.\n\n\n\n“Argh grah!\"\n\n“Well that’s another one for the cages, or are we going to dispose of this one?” you ask in a bored tone as Dr. Kovas fails to completely “resurrect” another one.\n\n“Damn! I strengthened the dose to compensate for her vegetarian diet! She shouldn’t be trying to bite me!”\n\n“Y’know we’ve been doing this for about a year now and we’ve still made a lot of progress.”\n\n“I’VE made a lot of progress, but what is your point?”\n\n“My point is, maybe this just isn’t in the cards. Maybe we can’t bring someone back, well not in a good way at least.”\n\n“Hmmm, what is this? A moment of conscience? Some sort of introspective that we’re not supposed to play diety? You losing your passion for this work?” Dr. Kovas says with a sneer.\n\n“Ha ha ha ha! No, perish the thought.” You laugh\n\n“Oh? Then what is it?”\n\n“Well I’ve been thinking…”\n\n“Ha ha ha ha! Oh this SHOULD be amusing.”\n\n\n\nYou make a slight facial tic at this insult, but then continue hoping that your “mentor” will listen to you.\n\n\n\n“What I was going to say is we’ve got the medical knowledge and equipment to run a good body legging business. Lots of demand for body parts on the black market. And with the advances we have made with incitathol we could even sell some of the tamer zombies to wannabe necromancers or even for pit fights. It certainly would put our skills to better use.”\n\n\n\nDr. Kovas sighs and shakes his head at you.\n\n\n\n“Oh my dear boy, you have learned NOTHING while serving under me! First of all, what’s this we business? I’M the only real doctor here; you haven’t even finished medical school yet! You think you can dare put yourself on my level just because I’ve allowed you to aid me and you cut up a few bubble headed co-eds? Hah! Not bloody likely! Second, you still don’t get it do you? Science is not supposed to be for profit! It’s about the challenges and over coming them! You want to make money why don’t you go reopen that little inn you used to have and serve swill to the other low lives? Now grab that mallet over there, smash this zombie’s head in and dispose of it. Menial labor is about all you’re good for anyway.”\n\n\n\nYou grab the mallet, but you don’t smash the zombie’s head in, you smash Dr. Kovas head in instead. His arrogance and complacency allows you to get in a good shot without him expecting it and he falls to the floor bleeding profusely from the head. You kneel down to finish him off.\n\n\n\n“YOU (WHAM!) FUCKING (WHAM!) PIECE OF (WHAM!) FUCKING (WHAM!) SHIT!” you shout at the top of your lungs while you beat the good doctor’s brains into pulp.\n\n\n\nAfter you’ve satisfied your bloodlust, you sit back and think about your next move. The tied up zombie girl on the table is disturbing your concentration with her growling so you shove some of Kovas’ brains in her mouth while you plan…\n\n\n\nYour major obstacle is explaining Doctor Kovas’ disappearance. This actually isn’t that much of a problem though. The man wasn’t well liked at all by his peers so nobody really goes looking for him. You are eventually asked questions by the Klyton militia, but you simply say one day you showed up to assist him and he was gone with no warning. They also ask if you know much about any of the disappearance of young girls around the university, but you say you don’t know much except that it’s pretty horrible. Again there is some suspicion, but not really on you and more on him.\n\n\n\nIt probably helped that the first thing you did was completely clean his lab, and left vague incriminating evidence pointing to him if suspicion should ever come up about anything. The second thing you did was clean out his savings (Lucky for you the old bastard didn’t believe in keeping it at a bank) but live frugally in a cheap apartment again.\n\n\n\nBy the time you finish up medical school you’re in the clear and Dr. Kovas’ disappearance is chalked up to him doing something illegal and then fleeing the city. You on the other hand are now a fully-fledged doctor with access to all that entails…\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t need to be said that your time with Dr. Kovas warped you and while you managed to lay low when necessary, you now feel more freedom to engage in all those ideas you tried to suggest to Kovas a few years ago.\n\n\n\nThe rest of your life is basically a mask of sanity hiding a very immoral person. Your crimes are vast, routine and you could care less. Your parents failed you, the inn failed you, even your “mentor” failed you and as far as you’re concerned you only managed to achieve your goals because YOU took charge of the situations that presented themselves and thrived.\n\n\n\nThis outlook on life never changes. You take what you want and you use people as you see fit. You never regret your decisions and feel only a weak fool would suffer any sort of guilt or remorse.\n\n\n\nAnd thanks to your intelligence, you mange to avoid punishment and you experience a death not granted to any of your many victims: Namely, you die as an old man peacefully in your bed.\n",

I’m surprised she only paddled you and didn’t have you kicked out of the school permanently.”\n\n“Yeah well it didn’t even hurt. My dad beats me harder than that. Though I guess Tom thought it hurt with the way he cried! Hahahaha!” David taunts.\n\n“Shut up David!” Tom exclaims.\n\n“So are you playing Smash Sphere over in the park today?” David asks you.\n\n“I hope so, but my dad’s been on my case about me studying harder. Says he wants me to make something of myself when I grow up.”\n\n“That sucks. My dad is always either at the mines or drinking at your dad’s place. The only time I have to worry about him is when my mom tells him about something I did, then I get a beating. I don’t think I’d survive it if he was always around.” David replies.\n\n“My mom doesn’t beat me, but she’ll yell and throw me into a small dark closet without food if I do something bad.” Tom says.\n\n“Your mom is one scary ass dyke, Tom. My dad said he saw her scare away a mountain troll in the mines once.”\n\n“Shut up David! My mom’s not a dyke!”\n\n“Yes she is! What about that other lady that lives with you then?”\n\n“That’s just mom’s roommate! She needs a place to stay so she helps around the house, like cook dinner or clean up. Mom is at the mines all day, so she can’t do that stuff, so it works out. She’s kind of like a live in maid!”\n\n“Sounds more like a second mom…”\n\n\n\nAs much as you enjoy Tom’s naïve defense of his lesbian mother and David’s taunting of it, you arrive at the Inn where you say goodbye to your friends and tell them you might see them later.\n\n\n\nAs soon as you get in, you dad calls you over to the bar.\n\n\n\n“So do you have any homework?” he asks.\n\n“Yeah, but it’s not due until next week.”\n\n“Hmm, well if it’s not due until next week it must need a lot of attention, better get started on it.”\n\n“It’s really not that much dad, I can do it over the weekend. I’m going to go out and play smash sphere with David and Tom.”\n\n“Is that what you think? Better cancel that idea. You’re hitting the books, besides I vaguely remember you mentioning you were also going to have test next week too.”\n\n“But dad!”\n\n“Don’t dad me! You’ve been letting your school work slide lately and getting into trouble at school with those two little hoodlums you hang out with.”\n\n“They’re not hoodlums, and I didn’t get into trouble today!”\n\n“You aren’t supposed to be getting into trouble in the first place! Look son, I know you think I’m being hard on you, but this really is for your own good. Your little friends don’t have fathers that give shit about them, I should know because David’s dad is in here all the time and as for Tom, well the less said about his situation the better.”\n\n\n\nDoesn’t look like you’re getting out of here today, but you make one last attempt.\n\n\n\n“But I really don’t have that much homework, I really can do it quick over the weekend!”\n\n“Well if that is the case, you can help me out here instead.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“One of my barmaids is sick and I’m expecting a full house here tonight due to it being one of the miner’s birthdays today, so you can carry food and drinks.”\n\n\n\nYou certainly weren’t expecting that.\n\n\n\n“What? Can’t mom do it?”\n\n“Your mother is going to have her hands full attempting to cook the giant cloudspeak ram in the kitchen for the celebration, in fact you can start off by helping her chop up the beast.”\n\n\n\nAs usual your dad has given you no \"choice\" at all.\n"
