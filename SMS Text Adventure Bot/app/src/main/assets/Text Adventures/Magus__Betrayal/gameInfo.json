  "This is the first part of \"Tides of War\", a multi chaptered story.\n\nIn Betrayal, you play the role of the young Magus Uriel, a skilled elementalist accompanying an emissary\u0027s treck to a far off city.\nOn the road, you will face enemies that only skill, luck and a deep understanding of your magic will allow you to survive Uriel\u0027s very first adventure...\n\nWhile sometimes slightly cynic, the game is supposed to be more serious than funny, with an appeal to those roleplayers among you. :)\n\nThe game plays in the entirely fictional world of Thyr, were magic rules the societies, and brave men with swords valiantly defend their settlements against goblins, trolls and other hideous monsters.\n\nI played with the thought of converting it to an Advanced Game, so that the game remembers your Element, for example, but then I am too much of a FightingFantasy-style fan, and if you really want to cheat by browsing back or pretending to be something different than you are, as long as you enjoy yourself, you\u0027re welcome..."
