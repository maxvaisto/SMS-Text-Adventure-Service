["5","Necromancer","EndMaster","6","8","7.21","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/Necromancer.aspx","                    Additional Notes:\nThis story is definitely more \"story\" than \"game\", however there are two distinct paths that can be followed, each with their own pitfalls and additional choices. There is also \"one true\" ending in which can be considered a \"win\" (You\u0027ll know if you got it, because you\u0027ll get an epilogue)\nThis story can get long, and assuming you\u0027re surviving, years do pass in it and you and your environment will change. There are a few points in the story where there are links that lead to more background information on various people and things. While not completely necessary to understand the story, they do give you more insight into it. The text that accompanies some of the pics are also done for similar purposes (Your journal entries, personal thoughts, letters written to you, etc)"]
