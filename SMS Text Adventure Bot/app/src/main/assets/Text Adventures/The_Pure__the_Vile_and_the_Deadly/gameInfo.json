  "Three ladies. Three legends.\nAdditional notes:\nThis story is a fully self contained one and can easily be read on its own, however it also acts as a connection to Rogues, Eternal and Necromancer.\nAs with any of my writings, the story comes before the game. However there is an epilogue for each \"winning\" ending."
