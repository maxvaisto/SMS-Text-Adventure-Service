  "page 123": "Your thoughts drift to when you were formally introduced to your new “family.”\n\nNormally you were never a social person, but considering these were fellow necromancers (and other forbidden magic practitioners) you were kind of curious to meet them.\n\nMr. Demar introduced you to everyone in the group, which consisted of a lot more demonologist than you expected.\n\nTheir opinion of you was mostly one of indifference, but friendlier than you’d expect. A lot of them seemed to be hedonistic types that partied quite a bit. Not much different than most on campus really, except they were generally a bit more on the sadistic side.\n\nYour reintroduction to the “top demonologist” Felsa was a little awkward as she undoubtedly felt quite the fool for allowing you to pull a fast one on her without much effort. Unsurprisingly Mr. Demar chewed her ass for that mistake and said he hopes that she’s less gullible when dealing with demons because the consequences would be much more hazardous to her well being.\n\nFelsa never did care much for you after that.\n\nYou of course were much more interested in meeting other necromancers, it was very surprising that only three others were counted in the ranks of the Dark Order.\n\nThe first one you met was Trelik who wasted no time in boasting that he was the most skilled necromancer of the three. Came from a family with money and seemed to pride himself on his appearance just as much as his magic skill. It was obvious that the pursuit of power was very important to him.\n\nHe was usually a combination of condescending and flirtatious towards you. He assumed his attractive appearance and skill level would impress you.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nIrwin was the next one. Even now as you search your memories, you barely remember much about him. He was competent in his abilities and was cordial, if a bit dull. Even his appearance is a bit of a blur. Just fairly non-descript all around.\n\nThe last necromancer there was Sebastian. He was the exact opposite of Trelik as far as appearance and personality was concerned. Humble and ugly. In fact Trelik never failed to make some sort of comment about how hideous Sebastian was. It didn’t really bother him much though, he’d been used to it from just about anyone he came across in his life.\n\nSebastian surprisingly also came from money, but apparently his family sent him off to the university to more or less get rid of him. In fact they donated quite a bit just to make sure the university accepted him.\n\nYou probably interacted the most with him besides Mr. Demar when you had questions about something. He obviously liked you as well, but was far too shy to tell you so.\n\nThere was one more Dark Order member of note that you remember. Quayle. He wasn’t a demonologist or necromancer though. He was a time mage, which was a less well-known branch of forbidden magic. The only one who practiced it other than Mr. Demar, and even he didn’t really focus on the branch. He more or less just guided Quayle to not create some rip in time and wipe reality. Apparently he was going to play a major role in the eventual take over of Nuro\n\nYou didn’t interact much with Quayle since he tended to keep to himself anyway, but he also spoke in an odd way that you didn’t really understand. Not many did.\n\nAs for Mr. Demar himself, you found him to be intelligent and you respected him the most. He was a good teacher and if nothing else, you were going to learn as much as you could from him.\n",
  "page 125": "As dangerous things are potentially getting in sticking around in Nuro, there’s something about leaving it that still causes you a bit of anxiety. Strange that it should given your past experiences that have been far more life threatening.\n\nThis now leaves you to do some searching for the cabal of necromancers that Big Red told you about. You aren’t sure where to look until it suddenly occurs to you that once again Big Red probably told you indirectly and you might find them in the conjuration building.\n\nOf course this also makes you wonder if Big Red is setting you up again somehow. Or he isn’t and you’re just second guessing because Big Red being a demon would love to fuck with a mortal mind in that way.\n\nIn any case, it’s as good a start as any; so you decide you’ll head over there and just be prepared.\n\nThe conjuration building is on the complete opposite side of the campus of the library you stay at, so it makes sense you never bothered to go over there. Not only that, but you didn’t see much point in summoning magical animals, given that’s about the only thing conjuration is good for and it’s highly restricted anyway. You especially can’t summon demons, not that you’d want to.\n\nOf course now that you think about it, maybe it does make sense that other necromancers would hang out in a place where a barely legal form of magic is taught.\n\nEventually you get to the building, which doesn’t particularly stand out from the others on campus. You do see a few more demon janitors in there and as usual they start avoiding you and making a few insulting comments as well.\n\nWhile it’s late and classes probably aren’t in session, you figure that if there is a cabal of necromancers here, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t still be around somewhere. Of course you’re just guessing at all this.\n\nSuddenly you hear a voice, at first you think it’s another demon janitor insulting you, but instead it’s a young woman with red hair.\n\n“Ugh! That smell! Sebastian, I thought you… oh. Who the fuck are you?!” she asks demandingly.\n“Uh, I’m new.” You say.\n“I’ll fucking say! Didn’t Mr. Demar train all you dead lovers to mask your magic aura? Shit, you smell worse than that ugly ass Sebastian!”\n“Yeah Mr. Demar said that was the next thing he was going to show me. I…uh forgot where his office is though.”\n“Well it’s two lefts, a right, straight ahead, another left, down the stairs, a left and a right. He should still be in there.”\n“Wait, two lefts, a right and what?”\n“Two lefts, a right, bah never mind I’ll just take you there before you get lost and call attention to a campus security guard that decided to patrol here tonight. Though given how you smell, I don’t know how the fuck you haven’t drawn their attention in the first place.”\n“I…uh use enchantment magic a lot.”\n“Hm, well that’s only going to go so far. Come on and quickly, because I don’t want to smell you any longer than possible!”\n\nThe woman says her name is Felsa and quickly tells you to follow her.\n\nYou heard Big Red mention a Mr. Demar, you can only guess he must be in charge of the cabal of necromancers. You’re a little puzzled though by this Felsa that she would be offended by your “smell” if she’s a necromancer herself.\n\nWhile you’re heading down one of the corridors, Felsa looks over at you and speaks again.\n\n“You look a little on the young side and I don’t recall ever seeing you in any classes. You a freshman?” Felsa asks.\n“Yeah, that obvious huh?” you say.\n“It’s beyond obvious. You’re lucky Mr. Demar noticed you when he did, because like I said, it’s amazing you haven’t gotten questioned by campus security. I’m betting you get a lot of people avoiding you though.”\n“Yeah. So how long have you been a necromancer?”\n“Me? I’m not a fucking dead lover. I’m a demonologist! You couldn’t tell?”\n“Oh. Yeah, I’m still a little bad at sensing others specialties.”\n“Meh, I suppose you couldn’t have known, I’ve been able to completely mask the brimstone. Though we demonologists also have the advantage of there being actual demons on campus so we can always make that excuse. Anyway, watch your step.”\n\nThe pair of you go down the stairs, and now you’re a little confused. You thought this was a cabal of necromancers. There’s demonologists too? Summoning demons is just as illegal as necromancy, so maybe it’s a coalition of such people. Though you’re not really keen on associating with demon worshippers.\n\nEventually you get to Mr. Demar’s office. Felsa opens up the door and you see an older man busily shuffling some papers around.\n\n“Damn it! I thought I locked that door! Felsa, what do you…and what do we have here?” Mr. Demar says taking immediate interest in you.\n“This newbie…what is your name anyway?” Felsa says.\n“Catalina.” You answer, already expecting your mild deception to be unveiled.\n“Catalina said she needed to find your office to help train her to mask her necromantic aura. And I’d say not a minute too soon!”\n“Hm, yes, we do need to take care of that. Thank you Felsa, you may go.”\n\nFelsa nods and rushes out the door in an effort to get away from the smell, leaving you and Mr. Demar together. Mr. Demar gets up from his seat and makes a small gesture with his hand where upon you hear the door firmly lock.\n\n“So…Catalina. How did we miss you? Or rather how did you know to seek us out?” Mr. Demar asks stepping around his desk to approach you.\n“Big Red…” you start to say before Mr. Demar interrupts.\n“Ah of course, Big Red. And how is that scheming demon? He’s still failed to deliver on some books I paid for.”\n“He tried to get me to deliver a black cube to you, but I didn’t trust him.”\n\nMr. Demar chuckles.\n\n“Well that proves you’re smarter than Felsa, who apparently just believed you to be a new student of mine…are you even a student at this college? You look slightly younger than most.”\n“No. I’ve been living in the old library for a few years now.”\n“Interesting. Y’know I once considered that to be the hiding spot as it were, but then I figured hiding in plain sight worked just as well given the fools on this campus, along with the help of the demonic janitors. In any case Catalina, I can tell you’ve come here seeking answers, but before you find any, I’m going to have to know more about you. And I mean your whole backstory.”\n“All of it?”\n“Come now, it can’t be that long, you’re what? Sixteen or seventeen maybe at most? Just start from the beginning of when you first developed your affinity towards necromancy. I’m sure it’s an interesting tale.”\n\nSeeing little other choice, you sit and proceed to tell Mr. Demar of your history. The grave wings, the orphanage, practicing magic, living in the old library, all of it.\n\nWhile you’re telling your tale, Mr. Demar listens intently, not really interrupting other than a few times for clarification on a some things. When you’re finished, he looks at you a bit and after a quick stroke of his beard, he speaks.\n\n“You took a lot of risks in staying in Nuro, you took an even bigger risk coming here, however it would seem your risk has paid off since I’ve decided not to destroy you…yet” Mr. Demar says.\n“Thanks?” You answer.\n“Don’t thank me just yet, because as of right now you’ve been conscripted into the Dark Order. Such natural magical talent can’t be overlooked and will be put to use for our goals.”\n“Which are what exactly?”\n“Oh I’ll get to the details of that soon, but in short our mission is to correct the current order of this world by ensuring the truly powerful rule above the weak. But first, let’s take care of your unfortunate aura issue.”\n\nAt first you think he’s going to cast something himself, but instead he tells you how to do it. The funny thing is it’s so simple; you aren’t sure why you didn’t think of it yourself. You suppose that’s the benefits of learning from a teacher rather than just teaching yourself.\n\n“There. You smell better already and could easily fit in with the common learning class on campus, which you’ll be doing soon after I see what you can do personally. I want to see exactly how much I need to teach you and the other branches of magic that you know, because it’s important to not just rely on a single focus. Not being versatile enough can lead to enemies counter acting your strength and then where will you be? That’s why the Dark Order doesn’t just consist of a single branch of outlawed magic.”\n\nMr. Demar suddenly gets right in your face and both of his hands grab your wrists.\n\n“Now if we’re going to continue this potential relationship, I think it’s time to see your skills put to the test.”\n\nAt first you think he’s going to try to molest you in some way, but that’s not what he’s about. Instead you’re teleported to someplace dark with a few undead corpses wandering around. They see you and immediately attempt to attack until Mr. Demar holds them back.\n\n“Now that should last a few minutes. But it won’t last long after I leave. It’s going to be your job to control them. If you can do it, then we’ll have a place for you. If not, well, your body will at least serve in the war to come.”\n\nMr. Demar teleports away and you’re left alone with three corpses and no escape. You have to admit; you’ve never quite gotten the hang of controlling a single fully intact corpse, let alone three of them.\n\nYour first instinct is destroy at least two of them, but you know Mr. Demar wants to see if you’re actually capable of improving your necromantic skills. And quite frankly you do too.\n\nYou focus…\n\nThe three corpses shamble towards you. With some effort, you manage to stop one in its tracks. However the other two continue towards you.\n\nOne of them lunges at you and you barely manage to dodge, unfortunately you lose temporary control over the one you managed to hold the first time around.\n\nYou sprint as far as you can in this dark room and once again order the rotting bags of flesh to stop. You feel lightheaded temporarily like you’re going to pass out, but you manage to keep it together. In fact you feel a surge of energy like you never have before and you manage to hold two of them in place.\n\nThe third one continues to come at you, and you continue to try to control it. The desire to just set this thing on fire is great, but you resist. Even when its decayed hands are within reach of your body, you focus. The thing grabs at your neck even digging in its nails a bit, but you are undeterred. You WILL master this magic once and for all!\n\nAnd then it all clicks just as you’re starting to feel the effects of strangulation; the corpse releases its hands from your throat and backs away obediently. It then stands near its fellows.\n\nYou’ve done it at last.\nMr. Demar soon returns with a smile.\n\n“Good. I knew you’d succeed. Now that that’s over with, I can introduce you to the rest of your fellows. Never again will you be alone. You are now part of an order that will last forever and YOU will play an important role in it.”\n\nYou’re still not quite sure about all this, but for now, this will probably be an easier way to develop your ever-growing skills.\n",
  "page 124": "The years of your “college life” were a mixed bag.\n\nBeing an actual “student” was sort of an interesting experience while it lasted. You got to explore what the fuss was about with college life properly a bit (as opposed to just sneaking about the college like you had been doing).\n\nUnfortunately you weren’t too impressed with any of it though. Drinking, getting high, fucking, etc., it all seemed like a waste of time, which is why you didn’t really engage in any of it.\n\nWell except for music concerts. You didn’t really mind those, though even then it was because you really liked music (Something you discovered about yourself) rather than the actual “gathering.”\n\nBut other than that, why bother wasting your time on passing pleasures when you could be doing something more worthwhile? You observed that these people were future wizards and most of them barely had more ambition than learning what spells allowed you to drink yourself blind drunk without the repercussions of a hangover or a spell that cured whatever crotch rot you got.\n\nYou can imagine most of them would go on to just be new faculty at the college or doing something else uninspiring and repetitious like building some lord’s castle faster. While you can understand the logic in practical use of magic, you just were bored by those who seemed to be “gifted” with it.\n\nThe funny thing is your own new family wasn’t much better. You’re guessing though most of them being in league with demons might have had something to do with it.\nConspiring with beings that thrive on the lowest common denominator tends to lead more to degeneracy or at least that seems to be the case even if they originally started out seeking higher knowledge and power.\n\nAs for your fellow necromancers, they weren’t much better. In fact one of them was actually worse.\n\n“You see Catalina? I told you my power is growing every day and soon after we take Nuro, I will take an army to conquer the Brot Kingdom.” Trelik exclaims as he controls several raised corpses.\n“The Brot Kingdom huh? And what makes you think after we take Nuro, you’re going to be raising an army, let alone taking Brot with it? As I remember Mr. Demar is the one calling the shots and he hasn’t said anything about which way to expand, if we are at all.” You answer.\n“Well of course we’re going to expand! Nuro is just the first step! And Mr. Demar can’t control everything, he’s going to have to delegate and since I’m the best necromancer here, I’m obviously going to be in charge of important military matters and have territory of my own to control.”\n“And you really believe that Mr. Demar is going to trust you with this sort of responsibility?”\n“At this point, it doesn’t matter. I shall TAKE what is rightfully mine and be a king of my own!”\n\nTrelik’s been increasingly talking like he’s just as powerful or even more powerful than Mr. Demar, which he is most certainly not. Even if common sense didn’t dictate that Mr. Demar obviously has decades more experience, you can personally sense how powerful Mr. Demar is compared to Trelik.\n\nAnd this is why you don’t like him. He’s over confident in his abilities which to be honest aren’t much better than your own.\n\n“Oh don’t worry though, you lot can still assist me. Especially you Catalina, I’ll be needing a queen.” Trelik adds to his boasting.\n“You’ve got quite the imagination Trelik, a pity you weren’t that imaginative when we doing Mr. Demar’s assignment to create new spells. Who won that one? Oh right, that was me.” You say.\n“Bah, who needs new spells when the old ones work just fine!”\n“The old spells do indeed work fine, but my point was I beat you in something that you completely failed to do, so maybe you aren’t nearly as great as you THINK you are. There is still much you could learn from Mr. Demar.”\n“There is much you could learn from Mr. Demar” Trelik says in a mocking voice. “I’ll grant that the old man knows a lot, but that’s just it, he’s old. He won’t have the stamina to keep up with his plan and eventually those with more vigor will take the lead.”\n“Mr. Demar is knowledgeable in several different types of magic, including the dark arts. He’s obviously got stamina to spare if he can train the lot of us in such dangerous magic that requires a lot of discipline.”\n“You seem to know a lot about the old man’s stamina. Tell me, is that why he picked you as winner for that contest? You been testing the old man’s stamina?”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Oh I mean I get it. You want every advantage you can in the hierarchy. Hell, Felsa’s been known to sit on the old man’s cock from time to time when she’s not sucking demon dick. You ladies got the advantage on that front, but mark my words Catalina, you’ll eventually see that if you want to maintain a favored position, you’ll be wanting to make magic with me rather than someone who barely has more life than those we raise.”\n\nTrelik’s sordid accusations now cause Sebastian to start to say something, but you hardly need defending.\n\n“Interesting story. Here’s another one since it’s funny that you should bring up Felsa. Heard that when you and her hooked up at a party, you barely raised at all, and even then it didn’t last very long.”\n“Wha…what?!”\n“So why the hell would I want to be queen to someone that’s so…lacking in energy or power?”\n\nTrelik sputters and gets flustered. You take a defensive stance, thinking that today is the day that he’s going to finally snap, but he doesn’t do anything threatening towards you other than name-calling.\n\n“Fucking bitch, you think you have even half the power I have? When the day of reckoning arrives, you’ll soon see just how powerful I am. Fucking cunt.”\n“Hey, Trelik, why don’t you just leave her alone?” Sebastian suddenly says.\n\nTrelik can’t believe Sebastian is even directly confronting him.\n\n“Shut up, you fucking ass faced idiot! Thought you’d have enough sense to keep your mouth shut, but since you have opinion on this matter, let me give you a hard truth. You’re wasting your time playing paladin you pathetic slug, she’s not interested in you and you’ll never know the please of her embrace.” Trelik shouts at Sebastian.\n“And neither will you.” Sebastian quietly replies.\n\nAnd that did it.\n\nUnlike his reaction to your defiance, Trelik takes his anger out on poor Sebastian by casting a death bolt at him, which he’s only barely able to defend against with a shield spell. Though it’s still enough force to cause him to be thrown backwards into a pile of bones.\n\nBelieving that Trelik is going to start attacking you next, you put up a shield and raise several corpses near you. Even Irwin, who as usual everyone has forgotten about, puts up a personal magic shield.\n\nTrelik however is unimpressed, though he doesn’t press the issue.\n\n“Whatever. I’m more talented than ALL of you combined. I got better things to do than to piss my time away here, because unlike the rest of you I don’t need to practice.”\n\nTrelik takes his leave and you go over to help Sebastian up.\n\n“You alright?” you ask.\n“Yeah I’m fine. Are you okay?” Sebastian asks.\n“Sure, he didn’t nearly kill me.”\n“He wouldn’t he’s too obsessed with you.”\n“Hm, lucky me.”\n“Still, you should watch yourself around you’re alone with him.”\n“Pfft. I’m not worried about him. I’ve dealt with worse than him and had less ability to defend myself at the time. I’ll be fine.”\n“Okay, just know I’ll help in anyway I can if things get bad.”\n“I know.”\n\nSebastian now starts to look a bit shyer. As if he wants to say more but doesn’t. Or rather he does, it just isn’t what he really wants to say.\n\n“Hey um, just uh, I don’t believe what Trelik said about you. I know you’re not like that.”\n“You’ll have to be specific, since he said a few things about me.”\n“Uh, about you and Mr. Demar.”\n“Oh that. Yeah, again I’m not worried about what he said. Anyway look, I’m going to go study, I need to brush up on a few things before putting them into practice. See you later.”\n“Oh okay.”\n\nYou quickly take your leave before it gets even more awkward between you and Sebastian. You have half a mind to just call him out on his feelings towards you, but if he really desires you, he NEEDS to tell you himself as his fearfulness on this matter is just as undesirable as Trelik’s overbearing over compensation.\n\nDespite your detached views of “passing pleasures” you’re still young and curious about what all the fuss is about. Weakness of the flesh is an unfortunate reality.\n\nBut you’re only going to pick someone you see as worthy of your time and Sebastian hasn’t achieved that yet due to his meekness, not his physical appearance since it’s not like looks are a big deal to you.\n\nSure physical attractiveness is nice, but since your deeper understanding of necromancy, you understand just how fleeting looks are. Everyone grows old and dies. Even races like elves that sustain their appearance much longer rot in the ground like everyone else. Everyone dies.\n\nAnd you’ve come to appreciate and even see the beauty in it.\n\nUnlike most of your Dark Order “family” you aren’t really drawn to the darkness for power. Again, that’s a nice extra, but it isn’t the main reason. You’re attracted to death.\n\nMuch like a grave wing you suppose.\n\nMakes you start to wonder if you should even stay in the Dark Order. You don’t exactly have the same goals as everyone here. Then again you don’t really have any long-term goals other than perhaps increasing your necromantic knowledge.\n\nOverthrowing Nuro and potentially risking war with the entire world isn’t exactly something you have a great desire to do even if you don’t have any particular objections to it.\n\nJust sounds like a big hassle and you imagine at some point you’d be expected to lead armies and (gasp!) leave Nuro from time to time and you hate that idea.\n\nOf course leaving Nuro is something you might have to do if you want to avoid “hassle.” You’ve pondered leaving Nuro before several times in past, but ultimately you always stayed. One reason was your irrational anxiety of leaving the familiar, but the other was you weren’t really ready. Or at least you felt like you weren’t.\n\nNow? You’re more than able to handle yourself. Your magic skills in not just necromancy but other branches are enough to keep you safe. Especially since you know how to mask your deathly aura.\n\nYou think you’d be able to overcome your anxiety of leaving Nuro after a few weeks. You don’t even think you’d go to another center of “civilization”, you’d probably live on your own. You certainly have plenty of knowledge in nature magic to do so.\n\nOf course there’s still more you could learn here and part of you does feel mildly indebted to Mr. Demar for guiding your magic skills to a higher level faster than you might have achieved otherwise. You respect the man a lot and it doesn’t seem right to just abandon him after you were the one who sought him out in the first place.\n",
  "page 127": "No, you’re not going to leave. For good or ill, this place is still your home and you aren’t going to leave it due to having doubts or especially boredom. You also still feel grateful to Mr. Demar which you even acknowledge might be foolish on your part of getting attached like you did with Miss Olga.\n\nThough that attachment was a little different. You were younger and you certainly didn’t have any other feelings.\n\n“What the fuck is going on with you girl? That man is more than twice your age. Shit. Things were so much easier when I wasn’t suddenly thinking with parts other than my brain.” You say to yourself.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that you seem to be tethered to the same sort of urges as everyone else. Normally you’d take matters like this into your own hands, but you’re starting to wonder if you need to just get it over with to satisfy the curiosity part.\n\nSo what are you going to do? Go into Mr. Demar’s office naked telling him to just take you there on his desk? While you’re tempted to do exactly that, that would be pretty awkward if he wasn’t interested. And you’re pretty sure he’s not given that you’ve never detected any hint of attraction to you. (Makes you wonder if he is fucking Felsa like Trelik claimed though) In any case, you really don’t want to deal with potential complications like a “relationship” or all the gossip.\n\nHonestly hooking up with any fellow Dark Order members would just cause the same potential complications, maybe the key is to just pick up some boring random stranger to get it over with, that’s what most people in this college do anyway.\n\nTo hell with it, you’re going to go get laid, however since you don’t want to be a complete degenerate, you avoid asking the demonologists where the best hang outs and parties are and decide to just visit one of the more popular spots on campus where the college folk gather.\n\nYou wait until night and head to a place called the Alkymist. Someone’s idea of a cute play on words for a place that mostly serves wizards you suppose.\n\nSurprisingly the Alkymist isn’t very lively tonight. The hobgoblin tending the bar asks what you want to which you order something that isn’t going to dull your senses since you’re trying to get laid, not raped.\n\nYou aren’t exactly sure how to proceed since you were expecting more people to be here, but from past experience you figure eventually some guy will come up to you attempting to impress you in some way.\n\nSo you wait at a table by yourself.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd any other damn time some creep is attempting to make unwanted advances. Maybe you would have been better off going into Mr. Demar’s office naked.\n\nJust as you’re about to give up on this endeavor, you sense a strong deathly presence enter the bar. At first you think it’s someone from the Dark Order, but the person who enters isn’t familiar.\n\nIt’s a man in who looks to be in his late twenties or early thirties. Pale. Fairly handsome looking.\n\nYou can’t say you’ve had any contact with one before, but from the stories you’ve heard from Dark Order members, this man seems to be a vampire. The Dark Order is supposed to have an alliance of sorts with them.\n\nWhy one is here you have no idea, maybe they’re spying on you or something. In any case, you’ll soon learn why because he sees you and immediately approaches.\n\n“Hello, my name is Alec. I haven’t seen you here before.” He says.\n“Because I’ve never been in here before.” You answer.\n“Ah, that would explain it. So what brings you here tonight? I figured most would be at the Manticore House party tonight. People on campus couldn’t stop talking about getting ready for it.”\n“Oh. I wasn’t aware of it. I don’t keep up much on the latest campus stuff.”\n“So, you here with someone?”\n“No.”\n“Ah so, you looking to meet someone? I mean that’s one of the main reasons people come here. Well that and to get drunk, though the drinks here aren’t as good as they used to be.”\n“Well I’m sure you wouldn’t find them to be your taste that’s for sure.”\n\nAlec is silent a moment at your comment. He also sits across from you without asking to.\n\n“And…why do you say that?” Alec asks.\n\nYou nearly stare at Alec in disbelief for playing dumb, but you continue to refrain from staring directly into his eyes.\n\n“Please. I know what you are.” You say.\n“Hm. Yes, I suppose you’d be able to tell right away. But then, YOUR kind have an affinity towards those of my state of being don’t they?”\n\nAlec smiles while you don’t answer.\n\n“You see, I know what you are too. I could sense an appealing deathly aura about you.” Alec whispers.\n“Of course you do. So instead of all this pointless attempt at trying to charm me, why don’t you get to the point? Why has a representative of the vampire clans come here? If you want to speak to Mr. Demar, he’s probably still at the conjuration building right now.”\n“The clans? You mean that old aristocratic asshole club? Pfft, I’m not part of them. Or at least I haven’t been since the one who created me got himself killed. Free to do what I want nowadays and I sure as hell don’t want to be part of some stodgy system. Mind you I do have to not step on their toes in whatever little schemes they got cooked up, but that’s easy enough to do since I don’t have much in the way of grand ambition. Probably why they don’t give a shit that I’m not around actually.”\n\nWell this is interesting to keep your attention, assuming he’s telling the truth of course.\n\n“So you’re telling me, you’re just some vagabond vamp with no ties to anything other than your thirst.” You say.\n“Well I like to think I’m MORE than just what I eat. I have other interests. For example, I come to this place often whenever I’m in Nuro because it brings back fond memories of when I was younger. Used to hang out here with my friends playing darts, getting drunk, telling jokes, and occasionally going home with a lovely lady. You know the usual things one does in one’s misspent youth.” Alec says.\n“Hm. Wouldn’t know much about that seeing as I’m still young and I try not to misspend any of it.”\n“Yep, you’re definitely a necromancer.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n“Gloomy, dour, and generally no fun. Well with a few exceptions, but then those type tend to be arrogant dickheads who are no fun in other ways.”\n“Well if I’m no fun, don’t let me keep you. I’m sure you got better things to do. Why don’t you try the Manticore House party you mentioned? It’s probably lively with a bunch of dumb unsuspecting co-eds who you can lure into a dark alley or something.”\n“Why repeat myself?”\n\nYou have to admit, there’s a part of you that found that amusing.\n\n“Okay I saw you smile at that comment.” Alec adds.\n“So is this how you get your prey? Try to wear them down with attempts at humor?” you ask.\n“No, I generally just use the gaze for that. This is how I try to get a lady I’m genuinely interested in.”\n“You don’t even know me.”\n“I know you’re pretty, I know you’re obviously intelligent. Hell, we even know one secret about each other already.”\n“At this rate, it’ll be the only one.”\n“Oh come on! I know you’re not here to just enjoy the ambiance of this place. You obviously aren’t the type to do anything without a major purpose. You were here to meet someone.”\n\nYou can see Alec’s not going to leave you alone about this, so you indulge him a little longer.\n“Okay, fine. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with socializing and shit. And yeah, that also included potentially meeting someone.”\n“Alright and how the hell did you think you were going to accomplish that by sitting in a dark corner away from everyone?”\n“What difference does it make? Nobody was here anyway.”\n“Okay, but what if this place had been crowded? I’m betting you would have done the same thing, am I right?”\n“Perhaps, but given past experiences without even trying, I’m sure someone would have come up to me.”\n“Oh I’m sure they would have. And what would you have done? Probably given them a hard time and put up a wall like you’re doing with me right now.”\n“If they couldn’t deal with my personality then they obviously aren’t worth my time. And as for you, you’re a fucking vampire. Of course I’m going to be EXTRA careful around you.”\n“I don’t believe that.”\n“Don’t believe what?”\n“I don’t believe you’re worried about me being a vampire. If you were, you wouldn’t still be talking to me since I imagine you don’t spend this long shutting someone down.”\n“And I’m probably not going to spend too much longer on you either.”\n\nAlec sits back a moment. He’s obviously trying to figure out a different tactic. And you of course are still curious enough to see if he’s going to finally impress you.\n\n“Alright, I can see I’m antagonizing you.” Alec says.\n“You leaving for easier prey?” you ask.\n“No, I ate before I came here. I’m going to tell you a little more about myself. Obviously I don’t have time to go into decades of the past, but maybe this will put you at ease.”\n“Not really. You could just make it all up.”\n“Well then at least you’ll hear a good story.”\n“Fair enough. I’ll listen.”\n“Thanks for giving me a chance…um…this would be easier with your name.”\n“It’s Catalina. Hey wait, did you know the Great Lich Lord?”\n“What? No. I’m not THAT old. And that’s an appropriate name to match your beauty.”\n\nAlec goes a little bit into his life before he was a vampire. Mentions he wasn’t actually a student at the magic college, but rather was a city worker that happened to have a few buddies that had some magic skills so he was usually along for the festivities.\n\nHe goes into a bit about how before he was turned he didn’t really think too much about anything that lay outside the walls of Nuro since he had pretty much all he needed here.\n\nYou notice he doesn’t quite go into detail about the vampire that made him (or even why) and only really mentions brief details. And even in those details you get the impression the “relationship” wasn’t the most positive one other than all the new things he saw and places he travelled to.\n\nHonestly though, you’re only half paying attention to most of it. Mainly because you don’t really care about any of it, because your foremost purpose was to just get laid in the first place. And just your luck, this vampire so far is your only suitor tonight.\n\nHe is quite alluring and it isn’t due to any sort of “vampire charm” he’s attempting. It’s the fact that he’s also giving off a powerful deathly aura, even more so than Mr. Demar. You can only imagine that’s due to him actually being dead. You’ve always seen the beauty in death and a vampire would certainly be a good embodiment of it.\n\nPart of you just wants to throw caution to the wind and go off with Alec right now, of course you’re still entirely there since you are still very aware of the danger of this. It would help if you could determine if he’s being sincere about anything.\n\n“So how about you?” Alec asks.\n“How about me what?” you answer temporarily being brought out of your own thoughts\n“About yourself? I’ve been droning on about myself and not letting you get in a word edgewise. We’re supposed to be getting to know each other better right?”\n",
  "page 126": "You’re letting yourself get too attached. You did this before with Miss Olga. You’re not making that mistake again.\n\nRight or not, you have to do what’s best for you and getting involved in a war isn’t part of it.\n\nYou think about where you’re going to actually go and the best place you can think of is the Drozz Wasteland. If war breaks out, it’s going to involve the powerful nations of the world, so it’s best to stay away from those areas.\n\nYou’ll find a secluded spot and make your home there. Will it be permanent? You don’t know, but you can figure things out. Maybe a change of scenery away from civilization is just what you need anyway.\n\nOf course the Drozz Wasteland is full of a lot of savage orc tribes and such, but those lot tend to give a wide berth to difficult targets with little reward and that’s exactly what you’ll be.\n\nBest way to do this is to just do it as quickly as possible. You go to your quarters and start packing your stuff. When you think you have what you need, you take your leave.\n\nBefore you get off the campus, you have think, you’re going to get stopped by Mr. Demar or someone else, but that doesn’t happen. Doesn’t happen when you’re actually leaving Nuro either.\n\nIt isn’t long after you’ve left Nuro though when you stop and realize that this is the first time you’ve been out of the city. This is a completely new experience for you.\n\nYou have to stop a few times trying to calm yourself down about how anxious you feel.\n\n“Get a hold of yourself Cat. It’s just like a large park. You’re a wizard of considerable skill. There isn’t any danger that you won’t be able to face.” You tell yourself.\n\nEventually you believe it and travel is much easier.\n\nEasier is a bit of a relative term since this is the first time you’ve ever travelled outside of a city or anywhere for that matter.\n\nYou aren’t exactly sure how far you’re going to go into the Drozz Wasteland. You figure you’ll know when you get there.\n\nA few days pass and there’s still no sign of anyone coming for you like you half expect there to be. Maybe you weren’t really that important in the grand scheme. Just another potential soldier.\n\nA minor part of you is a little insulted at this idea, though if that is the case, you also believe it was a good idea you left.\n\nEventually you do start to run into trouble from the inhabitants of Drozz which unsurprisingly are of the orcish variety. You don’t have much issue with them though as they don’t employ very complex tactics. It isn’t killing a few that causes them to start leaving you alone though, its raising them back from the dead that causes them to give pause. You don’t have much issue with the greenskins after that.\n\nWith attacks dying down, you finally decided to put down roots and build a simple home (With the assistance of your newly raised orc corpses) not far from a water source.\n\nYour knowledge of nature magic comes in handy as far as growing food. Good thing since there isn’t much in the way of food that’s easy to come by in this place that doesn’t rely on hunting. Fortunately magic makes that a little easier too.\n\nDoesn’t take long before you’re settled in pretty well. The odd thing is you’ve probably brought a bit more “life” to your surrounding area of the Drozz wasteland thanks to your use of magic to make your own more comfortable.\n\nOf course you haven’t completely abandoned your necromantic practices. For one, you still have undead orcs patrolling your personal grove. Though you also spend a lot of time practicing odd new spells using a combination of necromantic and nature magic. You perfect your “Death vines” that you were working on during your time in the Dark Order.\n\nGravewings are drawn to your grove which you enjoy as you’ve always found them to be pretty.\n\nA few weeks pass and you settle into a routine of keeping yourself busy. You don’t particularly miss having to be social. You lived in the abandoned library for a few years by yourself so being alone isn’t really new to you.\n\nAnd yet, you’d be lying if you didn’t sometimes wish there was someone else to speak to. Not with mobs of people of course, just one would suit you just fine.\n\nYou briefly think if you shouldn’t have asked Sebastian to come with you. He probably would have followed. You then shake your head.\n\n“No. Too meek. Mr. Demar on the other hand…” you say to yourself and just end your statement with a minor chuckle.\n\nBesides the weakness of faint biological urges you didn’t really get a chance to participate in, you also miss music a bit. You try to fill that void somewhat though by humming the odd tune to yourself. Sometimes it’s from a song you remember. Other times you’re just making it up.\n\nIt’s during one of these uneventful nights that you suddenly sense a strong deathly presence and it’s not the same as the one you’ve created as your home…\n\nYou hear your undead orcs spring into action outside your home and you open the door just in time to see a man in his twenties making quick work of them with his sword.\n\nHe looks human, but given how fast he moved and the unnatural aura you’re sensing, he clearly isn’t. You’ve heard of these before.\n\nA vampire.\n\nYou’ve heard a few things about them over the years and even more during your time in the Dark Order. Mr. Demar said they were to be allies when the time comes.\n\nNow you’re wondering if this one has been sent to come find you and potentially drag you back to the Dark Order.\n\nOr just kill you. In fact, you’re betting it’s that one. You stay in your home and attempt to hold him in place.\n\n“Um, you know that’s not going to work on me right? I’m a vampire, not some dumb ass zombie.” The vampire says, realizing what you’re attempting to do.\n\nYou’d cast fire at him, but you can’t risk setting your grove on fire if he dodges and given how quick he is, he probably will. Staying in your home is you safest immediate move since he can’t enter it.\n\n“Catalina isn’t it? My name is Alec! Look I’m not here to hurt you! I’m just here to talk!” the vampire shouts.\n“I highly doubt that.” You exclaim.\n“Understandable that you don’t trust me, but at least hear me out! I don’t want to be out here than you want me out here.”\n“Better hurry up.”\n\nAlec seems relieved that you’re willing to listen, but really you’re just stalling for time and hoping to catch him off guard for something you have in mind. You also tell him to stay where he is because you’re not going to let him attempt to hypnotize you. You turn a bit to the side so you’re not looking straight at him and remember to not stare at his face for too long.\n\n“Wow, not taking chances huh? Okay, well like I said I’m not here to hurt you. In fact I’m here to offer you a way out of your situation with your life.” Alec says.\n“I’m not going back to the Dark Order. I’m just not aligned with their goals.” You answer.\n“Heh, well you’re not alone. The vampire clans haven’t exactly been completely thrilled with the Dark Order’s plans. I mean it’s still up for debate on if we’re going to really be allies or not and from what I’ve heard Lord Rostov is heavily leaning in the direction of not allying. Potentially maybe even opposing when this all goes down.”\n“Great. So why tell me?”\n“I was sent to Nuro a few months ago to sort of keep an eye on you lot and gather as much information as I could, but I sort of got sidetracked with the college parties making for easy prey and all. In any case, to my surprise I found out that the Dark Order had lost one of it’s flock. The one I knew the least about too seeing as you were a newer member and you really never left the confines of the Dark Order’s quarters. In fact, you’re not even officially a student at the college and there are no records of you. Hell, there’s not even any city records of you. You’re a bit of a mystery.”\n“And you still haven’t gotten to the point.”\n“I’m getting there. Anyway after learning about how pissed your former mentor is and this situation has caused a bit of stir, I reported back to my own superior and was told to go try to find you. Took me a bit, but fortunately you eventually stopped moving around and…alright I better just get to the point. The vampire clans wanted to know what your intentions were, and now that you stated them quite clearly, I have another offer from them.”\n“Oh?”\n“Yes. An offer to join.”\n“To join?”\n“Not as surprising as it might appear. While not a lot is known about your background, I do know you are considered one of the more promising necromancers that the Dark Order had. You obviously aren’t afraid of death. Why not take the next logical step?”\n“Become a vampire. Really?”\n“Yes really, you would be a valuable asset to us. You’re obviously very skilled and we would find a place for you.”\n“A place. Right. As what? Vampire sex slave? I’ve heard enough about how vampires treat their new acquisitions.”\n“What?! Is that what the Dark Order has been saying about us? No, it wouldn’t be like that and the clans just don’t pick anyone! True as a new vampire you wouldn’t have the most authority, but isn’t that just like with anything? When you were in the Dark Order, you weren’t near the top immediately right? However as a vampire you’d have more authority than you would ever have as a mere human. Even as a necromancer. Better yet, you would live in the shadows of society and free to pursue what desires you want without fear of exposure. Now, I’d think someone like you would appreciate something like that.”\n\nThere is some appeal to what he’s proposing and perhaps what you’ve heard about vampires from demons and Mr. Demar haven’t been completely true. Becoming a vampire would make “life” a lot easier too. You’d certainly have plenty of time to do whatever ultimately tickled your fancy.\n\nThere’s also the idea of being closer to death. And that idea is what intrigues you the most. It’s one thing to see death with living eyes, would you appreciate its beauty even more if you were one with it?\n\nStill though, you’d be taking a big risk.\n\n“So, if I say yes. Who turns me? Your Lord Rostov?” you ask.\n“Oh, um. No, I was tasked with doing that. Someone like Lord Rostov is a little busy to turn everyone that’s picked. Don’t worry though I’ll be filling you in on everything you need to know.” Alec says.\n“You?”\n“What’s wrong with me?”\n“Well forgive me for saying so, but seeing as you just said I would be a valuable asset to the clans, I’d think if not Lord Rostov then at least one of royalty or whatever you got ruling you lot would be turning me.”\n\nAlec shows a little annoyance.\n\n“Hey, you’d be glad to get me! You said you were worried about being as sex slave, well if one of the nobility turned you, you’d be at their complete whims and they get bored very often. I wouldn’t do that though. You’d be under my protection.” Alec says.\n“Wait. YOU just said the vampire clans don’t do that sort of thing.” You reply.\n“What sort of thing?”\n“Have sex slaves.”\n“I mean yeah they generally don’t, but yeah there’s unfortunately some bad apples. Like I said, you wouldn’t have to worry about that though since you’d be…”\n“Yeah, yeah under your protection. You said that already. But this brings up the question of why the hell should I believe that YOU wouldn’t turn me into your sex slave?”\n“What? I would never! I…I don’t even like girls! You’d be safe from me!”\n“And even if that’s the case, what about YOUR superiors or any vampire that’s more powerful than YOU? Surely you can’t protect me from them, and if they decide they want to command me, then I’m fucked in more ways than one.”\n“I assure you that wouldn’t happen!”\n“Shit, how do I know you have no intention on turning me and you’re just looking for a free meal?”\n“Catalina! I’m not going to do that! Look I’m trying to give you a way out, because after the Dark Order inevitably fails there will be sweeping repercussions, like renewed fanatical hunts for practitioners of such arts. And while you may believe you’re safe out here and can scare the dumb greenskins away. That isn’t going to work with everyone. Not to mention there are other things out here that you might not be prepared for. I’m the only option if you want to survive all this.”\n\nIt hasn’t gone unnoticed that Alec has been inching closer toward your position, probably hoping to distract you with arguing and catching you with his own gaze, but you haven’t been distracted at all, however his recents answers and demeanor have confirmed your suspicions.\n\nYou finally look at him directly.\n\n“Very well come...” You say.\n\nAlec smiles believing he’s won, but when you wave your hands motioning him to enter your home, he looks very shocked by the impact of something hitting him from behind. He looks down sees a thorny piece of dead vegetation sticking out his chest. He realizes it’s also gone through his heart.\n\n“…inside.” You finish saying and then he explodes into a pile bloody gore.\n\nYou soon see several gravewings descend from wherever they were to feast on the remains. Having dispatched Alec, you shut the door to your home.\n\nWhile you may be safe for now, you wonder if you shouldn’t move just in case you get more vampire visitors. You hate the idea of having to rebuild all over again, but you might have to. Of course Alec did say he had to find you and you didn’t exactly give him a chance to report back, so it’s still a case of nobody of any importance really knows you’re out here.\n",
  "page 129": "You’re not moving, at least not yet. You’re fairly certain you’re safe from further vampire attacks. The clans might even think the Dark Order killed Alec and that’s assuming he told the complete truth about everything.\n\nIf he did, there’s a brief part of you that wants to warn Mr. Demar about potential treachery of the vampire clans, but that’s impossible now.\n\nAs far as anyone else disturbing you, that’s not likely given how far you are into the Drozz Wasteland. The only ones remotely nearby are orc tribes and they stay away. Still, there’s no reason to not be a little cautious so you make your grove a little more defensible.\n\nAbout a month passes and there’s been no sign of any other intruders. You maintain your solitude and work on perfecting and experimenting with new spells. It’s a simple life.\n\nOr at least it is for a while; you aren’t sure how much time passes really, but there comes the day that you get visitors again. And it’s a real eye opener.\n\nYou’ve been out here cut off from most of civilized world, not really paying attention to anything other than your immediate surroundings. Now your immediate surroundings include at least a dozen hunters and monk types advancing on your position.\n\nYou can only guess that the Dark Order attempted their take over and failed. It looks like Alec was right about something years ago and that’s the rest of the world isn’t going to take any chances on any potential necromancers lurking about.\n\nIt would be pretty meaningless to wonder how they found you out here given that they obviously did. All that matters now is defending yourself against this group of crusaders.\n\nThe opening of the battle doesn’t go too well as they play it pretty safe and just unleash a mixture of fire related spells and explosives. Such things are pretty devastating to your grove full of vegetation (Living and dead), granted it’s not too good for your corpses either.\n\nYou haven’t been idle however in your necromantic endeavors and you proceed to summon the spirits of long dead warriors to aid you. Seeing as the Drozz Wasteland is home to several forgotten battlefields, your spell is successful and while your ghosts engage the crusaders, you proceed to try to put out the fires.\n\nBy the time you put out the fires, half of your grove has been burnt to ash. The magical monks and a few of the hunters have survived their ordeal with your ghosts and you can only guess they banished them with whatever spells they have at their disposal.\n\nThey advance a bit more towards your home which appears to be less fortified now, but not completely defenseless. You raise up choking black plants that release a toxic cloud catching several of the monks.\n\nThey clutch their throats and cough up blood as their flesh begins to rot off their bones.\n\nThis causes the remainder of the group to spread out and hasten their approach. Several of the hunters begin firing their pistols at you. You take cover back inside your home and unleash death bolts at several of them. The hunters however seem to be equipped with some sort of anti-magic protection.\n\nThe corpses the recently dead monks rise up from the death magic brought on by the plants and manage to catch a couple of the hunters who weren’t paying attention.\n\nEventually there’s one hunter left, and he’s not deterred. He strikes down his newly raised comrades before turning his attention back to you. With one more explosive, he throws it directly into your home. You quickly cast a personal shield just before it goes off, completely destroying your home and blowing you back with the debris until you hit a tree. Fortunately your shield holds and you’re none the worse for wear.\n\nThe hunter fires upon you as you’re attempting to recover, catching you in arm. He quickly follows up by throwing several daggers at you. You feel two of them sink into your body and you fall back to the ground.\n\nIt’s not ending like this.\n\nAs the hunter approaches with a blade in his hand to finish you off. You pull one of the daggers out of your side and use your blood to cast a spell that is most certainly going to get past his anti-magic protection.\n\nYou summon a Blood Specter, one of the more powerful forms of undead and not one for an amateur necromancer to summon. You’re of course no amateur, but your weakened state makes it risky. Still, you’re desperate.\n\nThe blood specter appears and wastes no time in approaching the hunter who stops stops in his tracks. Before he can react with a more appropriate weapon, the malevolent spirit shrieks causing the hunter to immediately clutch his face. He screams as he begins bleeding from his eyes, his ears, his nose and probably other areas as well.\n\nEven you experience a little of the spirit’s shriek and your nose starts to bleed, but you’ve protected yourself though you’re struggling to do so.\n\nWith the hunter writhing on the ground in agony, you can take it from here and attempt to dispel the blood specter before you can’t control it. It makes one last shriek before oblivion takes it.\n\nYou then grab the sword that the hunter dropped and bring it down on the hunter’s head several times until it’s just a collection of broken skull with brains and blood spilling out.\n\nYou’re exhausted and severely wounded, but victorious.\n\nThen you hear a loud crack and feel a sting to your chest. You look down and see blood pour out from the wound. You never see your assailant from afar. You just slowly fall to the ground and everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell that wouldn’t have been a good fate. Then again most aren’t, but that didn’t happen anyway. You’re having a hard time even remembering some vampire by the name of Alec. You’re guessing maybe you knew him? His face was clear enough anyway.\n\nAs for the Drozz Wasteland, you never did go there. Your beloved most certainly did though.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 128": "Better to be cautious about something like this. You make preparations to move. It’s not going to be fun potentially being exposed to an attack by the savage tribes around here, but you can handle them easier than a couple more vampires.\n\nWhile you have doubts about Alec’s intentions on turning you for your protection, you do wonder if he was telling the truth about the vampire clans and the Dark Order. If that part was true, then it’s just as well you left. You had your doubts about the Dark Order winning in the long term anyway, but with the clans potentially muddying the waters then the plan might not even get off the ground.\n\nThere’s a brief thought of you returning to Nuro to warn Mr. Demar, but that’s not possible. Even if you were welcomed back and allowed to leave again, it would potentially put you in even more danger and you’re trying to avoid that, especially now.\n\nAfter about a day of deciding to pack with you, you abandon your grove and move on to seek another place for yourself in the Drozz Wasteland.\n\nHalf the day passes and you see some figures in the distance. Or rather you see several, but most of them seem to be lying on the ground. Probably dead bodies, possibly from a battle.\n\nA few though are standing or kneeling over the others. They move in a jerky motion and you can’t quite tell what they’re doing, but they might be looting.\n\nYou’re confident in your abilities that you approach. You’re going to need a few bodies to help you build a new home, so this is a lucky find. You sort of thought you were going to have to do it all yourself. You imagine whoever is looting the bodies will run as soon as they see you, but if they don’t you’ll be ready.\n\nYou get a little closer and you can now see the looters a little better and they’re not other greenskins but they’re definitely not human. In fact they’re not even quite living and they’re not looting the dead of their possessions unless you count their body parts as possessions.\n\nThese are ghouls. It would appear the Drozz Wasteland is just full of surprises. This particularly alarming though since these are typically created by vampires and if ghouls are here, then there’s another vampire in the area.\n\nOne of the creatures looks up briefly from the body it’s eating and screeches at you before suddenly leaping at you in a zig zagging fashion. Doesn’t take long before his fellows do likewise.\n\nRaising the dead won’t help in time before they reach you, and you can’t control them since they’re already under control by the vampire that created them, so you rely on more direct means and attempt to hold them since of dispatching them, which is trickier than normal due to their odd movement patterns.\n\nStill, the beasts aren’t exactly the most sturdy, so a blast of lightning to the face is enough to take one out. They get uncomfortably close though before you take out all the attackers.\n\nAfter the battle you are somewhat concerned you’re in potentially more danger than you thought if there’s another vampire out here with ghouls at his disposal. Lacking another idea, you decide to raise all the dead bodies (minus the dispatched ghouls of course) and travel onward to make a new home quickly.\n\nWhen you believe you’ve found a good spot, you get your undead group to start building while you start to work on growing a new grove.\n\nA few days pass and everything has gone off without any problems. Unfortunately it’s just before you’re almost finished when you see more ghouls in the distance of your new home.\n\nThey don’t attack though; they just stand around watching safely from afar. You know damn well another attack is coming and moving again won’t help matters. You’re going to have to just weather this one. The good news is you’re more prepared than when you had to deal with Alec. The bad news is if this vampire has ghouls then he’s obviously much more powerful than Alec.\n\nYou build up more defenses and have your small undead company ready to attack as soon as the ghouls move in on you.\n\nA week passes and more and more ghouls show up watching your now more heavily fortified grove. You can only imagine this is some sort of psychological tactic. You still haven’t seen the vampire yet.\n\nUpkeeping your defenses all day and night is getting tiring and at this point you hope that they just get it over with and attack. Win or lose, at least you’ll be resting.\n\nAnd eventually that day comes. Or night rather. You hear the awful screeching and that’s when you know they’re attacking.\n\nUnsurprisingly the ghouls greatly outnumber your walking corpses, but they’ll have to get past the bramble and walls of razor thorns first.\n\nInitially the battle goes well, but eventually enough ghoul bodies have thrown themselves on the thorns that the rest just safely climb on their corpses and jump into combat with your zombies.\n\nYou naturally assist, taking down several of the ghouls, but they almost seem to be without end. You don’t really have time to think about it too much, but if there are this many ghouls, you can’t imagine just how powerful the vampire is.\n\nYou eventually whittle them down to lesser numbers, but you have to retreat back into your home as all your zombie meat shields are truly dead and you’re getting exhausted.\n\nThe ghouls claw at the door, which they will undoubtedly break through, but you should be able to take out the rest.\n\nOr at least you would have.\n\nAs you’re backing away from the door, you feel a sinking beneath your feet, as if the ground is soft. It’s not soft though so much as it’s hollowed out and you soon fall through part of it.\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim losing your balance and trying to grip on to something nearby. You see the ghouls break down your door just in time before all the ground around you gives way completely and you fall a short distance before hitting the bottom.\n\nIt’s pitch dark, you can’t see and even if you could you’re somewhat disorientated anyway. Before you can even get your bearings though, you are suddenly hit by a strong force knocking you back to the ground.\n\nYou see a pair of glowing red eyes and then bright white fangs and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell that wouldn’t have been a good fate. Then again most aren’t, but that didn’t happen anyway. You’re having a hard time even remembering some vampire by the name of Alec. You’re guessing maybe you knew him? His face was clear enough anyway.\n\nAs for the ghouls and the Drozz Wasteland, you never did go there. Your beloved most certainly did. He made a temporary alliance with the Ghoul King who was an outcast vampire, but you never met the creature.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 76": "While your natural inclination would be to strike down Marzost where he stands, something about all this isn’t adding up in your mind quite yet based on all the information you’ve heard from Big Red, Marzost and even Gikil.\n\nThen it occurs to you and you smile to the point where you can’t contain your laughter.\n\n“Those children are worthless!” You laugh.\n“What?” Marzost says.\n“Your dero babies are worthless. They have no souls. That’s why Big Red never pressed on with another deal attempt and turned his nose up. He realized he couldn’t get anything out of them. That’s why he told me not to bother with any of you.”\n“But…how do you know?”\n“Your mother was a svelk correct? Did Big Red offer you a deal personally for your soul?”\n“No.”\n“He certainly would have tried if he sensed you had one. He didn’t though. He probably didn’t sense that the children didn’t have any immediately.”\n“But… how did he sense them at all then?”\n“The blood I would imagine. The svelk blood is still there. Doesn’t do much good though without a soul though.”\n“Huh. Well I suppose that does explain his quick departure.”\n“Yep, you have nothing to fear Marzost, the dero race gets to live a bit longer. There’s something else though that’s a bit of a missing link.”\n“Oh?”\n“Yes. But it has less to do with you than it does with my current second in command. You may have been slightly right Marzost with your assessment earlier, I haven’t taken into consideration every angle Big Red is plotting. I’ve been believing I’m smart enough to outwit him, well it’s time to prove it with action.”\n“What are you going to do?”\n“Oh you’ll find out soon. I trust you’ll still be here in a couple days?” you ask.\n“Um, yeah I wasn’t planning on going anywhere. Why?”\n“I’ll be back alone at that time. I suggest you be ready.”\n“Ready for what?”\n“I don’t want to give away the surprise. In any case, it looks like my minions are nearly finished looting your crystals. I’ll take my leave of you now. Enjoy the view.”\n\nYou leave Marzost behind and approach your forces. A couple of them question if there is to be any more done here, you tell them no and that you have what you need. You then say you need to head back to the fortress and great ready for the next round of captives to sacrifice.\n\nWhen you arrive back home, what you actually do is prepare a potion. You haven’t prepared a potion like this in centuries, but you need every edge if this is going to work.\n\nGikil still isn’t back from the raid you sent him on, and while you still have the last prisoners he took you could sacrifice, you believe that what you’re actually planning is a much better idea.\n\nIn a couple days it’s done and you chug it down. Tastes every bit as awful as you remember. You’re now ready. The odd part is you’re actually not dreading this plan. True, at one time you wouldn’t have dreamed of doing this action, but the end result will be worth it.\n\nNot to mention you suppose you are sort of curious.\n\nYou slip out of your fortress during the night and head to the dero community. You get to the gates and predictably Marzost is on the battlements waiting just like you told him to.\n\n“I see you, let me open the gates.” He shouts.\n\nThe gates open and you walk in before Marzost can even come down to greet you. When he finally does, you see he’s still dressed in heavy armor.\n\n“Marzost, can we talk in private where nobody is going to potentially see or hear us?” you ask.\n“Yeah, we can go to one of the great halls, those remaining spend most of their time in the nursery or the barracks.”\n“No, I mean some place more… intimate.” You say and get much closer to Marzost.\n“Inti…wait…no…you mean…”\n“Uh huh.”\n\nYou crouch down to meet his eyes on an even level.\n\n“Get ready to make all your twisted fantasies about me come true rock eater.” You say taking a deep breath and then bringing yourself to kiss him on the lips.\n\nYou feel like you’re putting your lips on hardened dirt. Shoving your tongue in his mouth feels like you’re licking gritty stone. You pull back from your kiss and Marzost is speechless. While you’re certainly no stranger to males being in awe of you, Marzost really has taken it to a whole other level. You literally have to guide him back to his personal dwelling which he barely can utter the location.\n\nMarzost starts to remove his armor which is no simple task given how dero armor interlocks. While he’s doing that, you begin to remove your own clothing and look as seductive as possible doing it. Not that you really need to at this point, but you’re getting a mild amusement out of Marzost fumble about while he’s trying to take off his armor and watch you at the same time.\n\nSoon, you’re naked and sitting on the side of his “bed” which as expected, is also made of stone with no blankets or pillows. This is definitely going to be a rough ride no matter which way it goes.\n\nAs Marzost’s armor comes off and his clothing is next, you study his body. It’s in good shape, better than you thought it would be. Eventually he approaches you slowly. You also notice he hasn’t taken off his underwear yet.\n\nYou caress his chest, which feels not unlike a fine-grained rock. In fact most of his body does. Your hands eventually roam to where the most his important part is going to be entering you repeatedly. That’s the part you expected to be the hardest right now, yet oddly he’s not quite ready yet.\n\nYou notice Marzost hasn’t done anything except stand there. You fully expected him to start pushing you down and having his way with you or at least groping you by now, given how the dero go about their mating practices. For all his willingness, you’re sensing some nervousness. Expected while in the presence of greatness like yourself, but this is a bit different somehow.\n\n“Marzost is something wrong? Multiple times you touched my hand or attempted to touch me when it was not permitted and now that everything is permitted, you seem way more timid.” You say.\n“I…I… my apologies.” Marzost stutters.\n“Don’t apologize, be direct! I mean would it put you more in the mood if I pretended to be a helpless captive? I know how the dero are usually going about their sex practices.”\n“No! I want to make sure YOU enjoy it. You are a goddess and deserve to be treated as such in all matters.” Marzost says and finally gets the courage to touch you again, even if it is a stroking of your face.\n\nThis is definitely going a bit differently than you thought it would, but you’re getting a strong impression about Marzost.\n\n“Marzost…and I’m not asking this to attack your fragile masculinity, but are you a virgin?”\n\nMarzost doesn’t answer, he just looks slightly away from you, which pretty much says it all.\n\n“Any particular reason?” you ask.\n“Most of my race does what it does to survive…or did rather. There’s no love. There’s no closeness. There’s not even a twisted sadistic pleasure like outsiders believe. It’s purely mechanical. It’s just done out of the need to procreate. I don’t want to be intimate with someone unless it’s consensual.” Marzost says sitting down beside you.\n“Okay, so what about dero females? I mean granted they’re no prizes, but that’s what doggystyle is for.”\n“Let’s just say they’ve never been interested in me for whatever reason despite my past attempts. I know what you said before about my parents, about how the pair of them might not have actually been in love. Well that doesn’t change my perception of what I want. I wanted what I believed my parents had, which is love. I want the act to be more than just for pleasure or procreation. I’m not even sure why you’re doing this. You haven’t explained your reasons.”\n“Do they matter? You took your clothing off quick enough.”\n“On one level, no. Indeed I am enchanted enough by your beauty and personality that I’d be a fool to decline this opportunity. And yet, I know whatever your reasons; they certainly won’t be for love. This act won’t be special for you, but I suppose it’ll have to be special just for me. That will be enough.”\n\nYou have to admit, there is something “sweet” about all this. It is a bit unfortunate it’s coming from a dero though. Still, you suppose you can identify with Marzost’s feelings of unrequited attraction.\n\n“Marzost, believe me when I tell you, this act we’re about to engage in is definitely special for me. You just let me take care of everything. Close your eyes, use your imagination and believe that we are the only two people in each other’s lives. Believe whatever fantasy you have to make this act live up to it, but I NEED you to perform to completion understand?” you say.\n“Yes, Mistress.” Marzost says.\n“Call me Semra…now you just lay back and let me get you started.”\n\nYou lay Marzost down on slab he calls a bed and waste no time in pulling down his underwear. You lower your head and begin to go to work. You feel like you’re sucking a “soft” piece of smooth marble at first, but it doesn’t take long before the firmness matches the texture.\n\nAnother relief that you won’t be risking breaking your teeth or later on ripping your innards if his dick had the texture of something like sandstone.\n\nYou feel it growing in your mouth a little bigger than the first visual appearance would indicate. While you have a pretty strong gag reflex, after a few minutes of this oral stimulation, the growth of the width makes it feel like your jaw is going to dislocate.\n\nWith him now in a more suitable condition, you stop and then slowly get on top of him. Given the size, you’re actually glad you’re taking more of the lead in this as it allows for better control.\n\nWhen you feel it enter, you continue to proceed slowly until you’re getting a good rhythm. Marzost has been more or less silent during this whole affair. Now you really do feel like you’re fucking a statue.\n\nYou guide his hands to at least grab your tits so you can better involve him in this process. You’ve been with several virgins before, indeed you even can find it a bit appealing to be the first and thus ruin a male, as he will never have anything better ever again, but this has got to be the most awkward one you’ve ever been with.\n\nThis was definitely nothing like when you were with Francis. Now THAT was a deflowering that had some excitement.\n\nYou then notice he’s taken your advice to heart and closed his eyes and is whispering something. You can’t make out what he’s saying exactly. You do make out your name at first, but then it becomes something else in between the faint moans of pleasure.\n\nYou at first think he’s saying something in his awful language, but that isn’t it. It’s still common, just really quiet. You lean in closer to hear since you’re curious and that’s when you get it.\n\n“Oh yes, mama. I love you so much…ugh yeah…this is everything…I’ve wanted…oh mom…”\n\nYou can’t say you’re surprised and it makes complete sense. His mother was a svelk and was the only female that ever loved him. Obviously his idealized woman to a point where he had trouble with dero females and he couldn’t bring himself to rape a svelk female.\n\nYep, it’s all a rich fucked up tapestry of the mind. Well whatever works for him, hell, it works for you too.\n\n“Shhhh, my son. Mommy’s here to take care of your needs, she loves you so much. Remember this.” You say closing your own eyes and visualizing Francis.\n\nIt doesn’t take long before Marzost becomes more active and actually starts holding on to you tightly and thrusting into you rather than just laying there.\n\nYou hold on to Marzost just as tightly. If you were equal height you’d be face to face, but since you aren’t, his face is now successfully buried in your tits as you ride him. He’s not wasting any time sucking on your nipples, no doubt thinking of fond memories of when his real mother breast-fed him.\n\nAs the act goes on, he becomes more forceful to the point where he starts to grab on to you tighter and eventually you feel him release inside you. A lot. It’s a mess down there.\n\n“Guess that had been building for a long time.” You say as you try to get off him, though you have a slightly hard time doing so as it seems like you’re stuck. Apparently dero seed is much stickier than svelk or humans.\n\nWhile you’re attempting to free yourself, Marzost who you thought would be wiped out from your magical svelk vagina, doesn’t even seem tired. A testament to dero endurance you suppose. In fact he grabs one of your arms in an attempt to keep you from leaving.\n\n“Where are you going? It wasn’t bad was it?” he asks.\n“No, I just need to…” you start to say.\n“Semra I love you and I don’t want you to leave.”\n\nMarzost’s grip on your arm tightens and there’s now a real danger here given your vulnerability. Dero are really damn strong for their size. He could easily snap your neck, though you knew going through with this plan that something like this might happen.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, you’d attempt a magic attack to his eyes, but his home (and this entire community’s architecture) is filled with the magic nullifying rock. Combined with that and after your physical exploits, you’re not quite sure if you’d have enough energy to summon up the power for an effective attack.\n\nYou’re going to have to distract him at least temporarily before attempting to escape.\n",
  "page 79": "Marzost is thinking completely with his dick right now. He’s just experienced the best for the first time and physical attempts to push him away or outright attacking are just going to anger him and the last thing you want is death by dero rape.\n\nYou’re going to have to get a little dirtier (and a lot stickier) if you want out of this.\n\n“I’m not going anywhere, I just wanted to switch positions so you could take a more…dominant role.” You say in a soothing voice while running your hand across his face.\n“Dominant?”\n“It may surprise you, but when it comes to sex I feel the dominant role should be exchanged once in awhile to keep things from getting dull.”\n\nMarzost looks confused for a moment, but then quickly displays a smile before stretching his body upward to kiss you suddenly.\n\n“You…you DO feel something for me! Never did I believe it possible! But this is not the time for romanticism, I understand what a woman like you wants.”\n“What I wa…”\n\nBefore you can even complete you sentence, Marzost has lifted you off his dick (Making a “popping” like sound) and spun you around. You only just manage to elevate yourself up slightly from the stone bed when you feel Marzost thrusting inside you from behind. He grips your waist and maintains a strong rhythm.\n\nDoesn’t take long before he’s moaning and probably imagining his mother again. Also doesn’t take long before you’re doing something similar thinking about Francis.\n\nYou’re reminded of when you took that boy’s virginity, still seems like yesterday when little Francis didn’t know whether to kill you or fuck you. Fortunately for him, he was smart and picked the latter and really gave it to you like you’re getting right now.\n\nOf course this escape into fantasy is a bit muted by the fact that Marzost is actually beginning to slam into you hard enough that you’re starting to feel some minor discomfort. It’s like getting a brick thrown at your vertical smile repeatedly.\n\nStill, you can even get into that, but then he does something a little unexpected when he pulls completely out.\n\n“Did you finish again? I didn’t even feel the…” you start to say and then you feel a crushing blow to the back of your head. Not quite enough to knock you completely out, but definitely enough to put you on the verge of unconsciousness.\n\n“Shut the fuck up, I’m in charge now mom! I hate the way you left me alone! I loved you so much and you just left! You just don’t know…” Marzost says with some sobbing.\n\nYou’re barely hearing all this though since you’re still struggling to maintain consciousness. You feel a hand caress your head and move down your back.\n\n“I’m sorry… I shouldn’t have hit you so hard…I just…I just love you so much…I know what to do. I know…”\n\nYou then start to feel something a lot more “invasive” than what was going on before. In between your haze, all you can think is “Wait, no. He’s not going where I think he’s going is he?”\n\nAnd he does. Raw.\n\nYour initial reaction is to scream out, but all you can utter is a louder “Ugnh” sound thanks to being half awake. Your head is then roughly snapped back as your long hair is pulled.\n\nMarzost may have gotten off to a slow start, but he’s gone into full crazy dero mode now. As you feel repeated hard anal violation you are really starting to believe this may not have been one of your better plans.\n\nMeanwhile Marzost is up your ass to your guts and going on about how much he loves you. While normally you wouldn’t complain about being loved so “enthusiastically” but given that you now know just how sticky dero seed is, it’s potentially going to be very bad for your insides if he releases into your ass.\n\nQuickly regaining your senses, you realize that wearing him out isn’t going to work as planned or you’re not going to survive it at this rate. You have to get him to release you long enough to make your escape.\n\n“Marzost...hrm…Marzost…ugh…Son stop for a moment…agh! Please son…Uhn…stop and listen.” You say in a voice loud enough so he can hear, but not loud enough to sound like you’re giving him an order.\n“What?!” he shouts not even stopping.\n“Pull out…ugh…I want…agh…you to put it back…uhn…in my mouth…hrm…I want to taste every…ohh…drop…ahhh…”\n\nMarzost finally stops, though he hasn’t pulled out yet. You look back over your shoulder at him, in that alluring way that only you can.\n\n“I want to swallow every juice of our time together just to show how much mommy loves you.”\n\nMarzost is speechless. More tears just well up in his eyes as he pulls out of your ass. You feel like you just took a huge shit.\n\n“Do it quickly!” he exclaims and releases you completely from his grip to lay back. You slowly turn around while still on all fours.\n\nWhile most would just take this opportunity to run, taking the chance that they wouldn’t be caught. You probably could do it, but you aren’t like most.\n\nThis stunted creep ripped your asshole apart without your permission. You’re not going to just let that pass. Not to mention he punched you in the back of the fucking head and you’re pissed about that as well.\n\nMarzost is going to pay.\n\nIt occurs to you, that it might be easier to use a less strenuous form of magic involving fireballs and such. Perhaps something more personal is in order, and you remember using one such spell in a situation like this after Eldolith’s father pissed you off. It surprised the hell out of him and you got some enjoyment out of seeing the surprise on his face and his screams before he died.\n\nYou probably won’t stick around long to watch the facial expressions, but you can at least enjoy the screams as you run off.\n\nYou whisper something in your native language to cast the spell and repeat it several times. It takes all your focus which is difficult thanks to the literal pain in your ass and the massive headache, but you feel the change.\n\nYou look directly at Marzost’s dick of which the scent is pretty…unique at this point. You’ve done a lot of things in your time, but this whole affair is going to rank up there as one of the most degrading. But if it all actually pays off like you believe it will, then you’ll have no regrets.\n\nNormally you’d never go ass to mouth, but this is a special occasion.\n\nYou open your mouth wide…\n\nAnd then bite down as hard as you can on his big dick with your magically altered teeth.\n\nMarzost screams as you attempt to rip it off, but the girth is making that a bit difficult not to mention magically sharpened teeth or not, his dick still has the texture of a solid piece of rock. Realizing you might be in big trouble, you quickly grab his balls and squeeze as hard as you can while tearing into his scrotum with your nails. Again, his balls feel more like hardened stones and you wonder if this is even having any effect, but given his reaction it seems to be.\n\nIt’s enough to keep him screaming in pain and not crushing your head anyway.\n\nBreaking several of your teeth, you at last manage to chew off part of his dick. The taste of blood, dero seed and you don’t want to think about what else fills your mouth and you attempt to spit it back at his face. Unfortunately thanks to the dero seed having the consistency of strong glue, your attempts fail and it doesn’t go quite that far, instead the piece of meat just barely clears your mouth as the sticky mixture remains on your lips. The point is still made though.\n\nMarzost moans in agony and sobs “Why? Why mommy why?” repeatedly.\n\nYou don’t give him any sort of snarky answer; you just take the opportunity to run the hell out of here before his buddies come investigating all the noise. Still, Marzost’s screams do fill your ears with pleasure just as you make your escape.\n\nYou are already past the gates when you hear the shouting of several dero in their awful language and waste no time in putting even more distance between you and them.\n\nWhen you’re finally on the surface, you run to a small corpse and promptly vomit and hack up the remaining residue from your mouth. You’re going to have this terrible taste for days.\n\nYou’re naked, you’re tired, you’ve got broken teeth, your entire body aches, particularly your entire lower area, you’ve got a mess around every orifice of your body and you still have to make it back home and hope you don’t run into a large amount of undead along the way. Hell, you don’t even want to encounter any svelk along the way given your current vulnerability.\n\nThe trip back to your fortress is fortunately relatively uneventful. When you get within visual distance of it, you use your remaining strength to teleport directly inside and quickly make your way to your personal bathroom where upon you take time to take care of some personal hygiene matters.\n\nYou’re going to have to fix your teeth with magic, but that’ll have to be a little later when you’re less exhausted. Right now, you just want to enter your bed without completely ruining it.\n\nYou eventually collapse on your bed, hoping that in five days you’ll get the results that were expecting from all this.\n\nFive days pass…\n\nYou cast the spell again, just to make sure. You wait and there’s no doubt about it. You’re with child. Whether it was the fertility potion you drank, dero alterations, Marzost’s hybrid condition or all of those things combined with a bit of luck, your plan worked.\n\nYou laugh and grin at yourself in the mirror with your new teeth. Now it’s time for the second part, which compared to the first part, should be incredibly easy.\n\nYou tell one of your minions in the hallway to tell Gikil to just come see you in your room to give his most recent report.\n\nYou sit down on your bed on a pillow. It’s still sore back there though at least you stopped having issues with going to the bathroom. That was even more of a concern than your teeth.\n\nGikil enters looking a bit tired. He’s also wounded. He’s been showing more signs of battle fatigue and the like lately.\n\nHe goes on about a recent raid and how they only managed to gather twenty-six suitable captives and he lost about half of his forces doing it thanks to a sudden undead horde attacking in the middle of it. He goes on to say that most of the remaining svelk strongholds are heavily defended and he isn’t sure how he’s going to be able to easily attack them with the remaining forces you have.\n\nYou ask if there have been any signs of the dero, to which Gikil replies no then asking should there be and if there’s been any dero incursions since he’s been away raiding.\n\n“No, just making sure of all being prepared for all potential dangers. Tell me Gikil, how tired are you?”\n“Truthfully, I am a bit fatigued after this last raid Mistress. I still have my concerns about future…”\n\nGikil trails off and just stares motionless when he sees you stand up from the bed and completely disrobe as you walk towards him.\n\nYou put your arms around his upper body and look into his eyes.\n\n“Not too tired for me I hope.” You say.\n“…you…you serious?” Gikil asks.\n“When have I ever not been serious about these matters? Besides I’ve rethought your plan and I think it’s a good idea. You won’t have to go out and risk your life anymore. You can just stay here and pleasure me until the time comes for our leaving of this world.”\n\nGikil can’t believe what he’s hearing, but he’s smart enough to accept what you’re proposing.\n\nPity for him, he isn’t smart enough to know what you’re planning. Good for you of course.\n\nYou get on with the physical aspect of this plan, which as you expected is quite mundane. Though after your recent experience with Marzost, mundane is fine right now.\n\nNow you just have to hold out for nine months of undead attacks while being burdened with child and an ever-smaller group of “loyalists.” No small feat, but you’re confident that the difficult part is already over.\n",
  "page 78": "You’ve had enough dero dick that you can stand for a lifetime and giving this little freak more of something that he was blessed to even sniff in the first place is much more than he deserves. In cases like this you need to assert that YOU are the one in control.\n\n“Marzost, you will release me NOW.” You order.\n“But, I love you and…”\n\nYou don’t let him finish, you just summon up all the power you can and slam him in the eyes with a magic attack.\n\nUnder normal circumstances this probably would have killed him, but his home (and this entire community’s architecture) is filled with the magic nullifying rock of course. Combined with that and recent your physical exploits, the energy was low powered.\n\nWhile it was enough to blind him, it wasn’t enough to cause him to lose his grip on your arm, which he ends up breaking just by squeezing even tighter while he’s reeling a little from your attack.\n\n“YOU FUCKING BITCH!” he shouts and you then feel a punch to the side of your head. You finally get “unstuck” from his dick as you go tumbling to the floor. Unfortunately you’re also struggling to stay conscious and bleeding. You can’t even focus to cast again, never mind also having a broken forearm.\n\nYou can hear Marzost fumbling about and yelling about his eyes, so the best thing you can currently think of to do is to get the hell out of here.\n\nYou begin crawling and then getting up to stagger away. You get to the doorway when you feel a hand grab your ankle and yank you so hard you fall face first into the floor before getting dragged back. You attempt to struggle by kicking, but all that results in is Marzost twisting your ankle to the point of breaking it. You scream out.\n\nWhen Marzost lets go of your ankle, you some how still manage to roll yourself over and realize you’re going to have to try a different tactic.\n\n“Marzost…you can’t do this….you have to let m…”\n\nYou are interrupted by a strong backhand which feels like you’ve been punched by a stone golem. You spit out a few teeth along with blood. Now you really are struggling to stay awake.\n\n“Silent, svelk whore! I’ve been a fool to allow myself to be lead on by your bewitching beauty. What was all this for anyway? Was this one more sick game for your amusement before you left? Leave me pining away in anguish before the end of the world?”\n“I…”\n“Shut up! My people were right, you’re all alike. My mother left me, and you want to leave me too. Well I’ll not listen to any more lies from that pretty little mouth of yours. Open up.”\n“No…umpgh…”\n\nBefore you can say anything else you get a mouth full of dero cock in your mouth and down your throat. You also lose a few more teeth in the process.\n\nMarzost begins thrusting his dick in your face repeatedly as he grips your head like a vice. You can barely breathe and he isn’t allowing you up for air either. Combined with already having a severe concussion, your blocked airway isn’t improving your situation. Your one good arm weakly attempts punch at Marzost’s balls, but if you did any harm, Marzost didn’t notice as he continues to use your mouth as a seed receptacle.\n\nYour eyes begin to go into the back of your head and the rest of your body just falls limp due to lack of energy. The only thing holding you partially up is Marzost.\n\nIt doesn’t take him long to release again thanks to your velvet throat and the dero excitement for…aggressive sexual habits. Of course it coats your throat with the same sort of strong stickiness you were experiencing earlier. If you couldn’t breathe before, you really can’t breath now with Marzost’s gluey essence blocking your airway.\n\nMarzost lets go of your head and your upper body collapses to the floor. You make a few weak hacking and coughing noises before losing complete consciousness. Death soon follows.\n\nAnd while that technically is the end for you, Marzost is indeed a twisted little freak and keeps your animated body around in his quarters. (Tying it up in a compromising position of course)\n\nMarzost alternates between calling it his mother, to having sex with it, to beating the hell out of it while screaming at the top of his lungs. Usually all three of those at the same time though not necessarily in that order.\n\nEventually what remains of the dero population tire of Marzost’s insanity and just want to quietly spend what remains of their lives without a madman shouting about his mother while anally violating an animated svelk corpse.\n\nA mob of dero put the pair of you to a permanent death before setting you on fire.\n",
  "page 71": "You usually aren’t one to jump into a situation without at least a plan, but what’s the point now? Big Red outplayed you and what remains is just prolonging the inevitable.\n\nYou can only hope that Big Red is sincere in his offer, but that’s a lot of hope and probably misplaced. Still, there’s a part of you that doesn’t even care. You lost what you really wanted and you tried your best to cheat death for centuries, but it all wasn’t enough. You’re just done with it all.\n\n“Fine. I surrender.” You say.\n“Wait, really?” Big Red remarks.\n“Yes.”\n“You are just full of surprises. I sort of expected you to attempt to kill me when we got to the infernal realm. You would have lost of course.”\n“Of course. Hence why I didn’t do it.”\n“You also could have just went to the new world and lived out the rest of your life there. You could have even tried to seek some sort of immortality to try to cheat your fate.”\n“I suppose so, but honestly I think I’m just done with it all. I’m tired and I don’t have the patience or even the energy to start all over again on some new world.”\n“You do realize you won’t get any rest in the afterlife?”\n“Yeah I suppose not, but I’m guessing I won’t have the burden of having to be in charge anymore.”\n“Well you got that one right.”\n“Hrm. So, did you actually mean what you said, or am I going to just be sucking your cock for all eternity?”\n“Well since it wasn’t in a contract, I suppose the infernal thing for me to do would be to completely fuck you over, but that would be rather predictable so you’re in luck and I’ll honor our unofficial deal. Of course you will still be sucking my cock on occasion, among other things.”\n“Great, can’t wait.”\n“Glad to hear it. I like it when a lesser complies so willingly don’t you?”\n“Yeah, it was pretty satisfying once.”\n“Okay, well I’ll do you another favor and make your death quick so we can get on with it.”\n\nBefore you can say another word, Big Red suddenly puts his fist into your chest and crushes your heart. You blink once in shock and then slump lifelessly as Big Red pulls his fist out of you.\n\nEverything goes black.\n\nWhen you wake up, you’re in a very different place.\n\nYou’re on a fairly nice bed and well-furnished room with a single door, which is closed. The coloring is mostly red and it’s warm enough to be slightly uncomfortable.\n\nYou instinctively feel your chest and look down to see that you have no obvious wound. You also see that you’re naked.\n\nYou can only guess you’re in hell, you don’t feel any different though. Not yet at least.\n\nYou get up and off the bed, and are about to explore the room when Big Red enters.\n\n“Ah, you’re up. Good.” Bug Red says.\n“How long was I out?” you ask.\n“Not long, but then who can be bothered to keep track of time in a place where it doesn’t mean much right? Anyway, I hope you like the room. Tried to make it as appealing to your mortal sensibilities as possible.”\n“It’s a little warm.”\n“Yes, well this is hell so it normally is. Sorry, but nothing can be done about that. I’ve lowered the temperature about as much as I feel comfortable with. I’m not one of those oddball frost infernals. Not to mention this is still my dwelling so I make the rules. Speaking of rules, going to need you to get back on that bed and on all fours. Quick as you can.”\n\nYou’re a little taken aback and Big Red’s face displays some annoyance.\n\n“Come on Semra, you came here willingly, contract and even submission. Are you REALLY going to fight me on this now? Because that will NOT go well for you.”\n“No! I just didn’t know we were going to do that immediately. I thought I was to be more of an advisor.”\n“And so you shall be, but we have to get to some of the humiliation first. I mean you are here for a reason. You didn’t expect that you were going to just continue your existence here in relative bliss did you? Granted I will be gentler than most would be, but this is happening and similar things will happen from time to time. Now we can do this the easy way and you maintain your favored status with me, or we can do it the hard way and…well you not find your quarters as relaxing to exist in during the downtime.”\n\nNot much you can do except comply, so you do. Big Red gets behind you.\n\n“Alright, now spread those cheeks wide because I’m going in raw.”\n\nAt first you think he’s going to just fuck you in the ass, but it’s a little worse than just simple anal violation. A lot worse.\n\nBig Red liked “fisting” you the first time he punched a hole through your chest to crush your heart so he decides to do it again, though this time he decides to do it by shoving his whole arm up your ass through your insides, totally ripping everything apart.\n\nThe pain is nothing like you’ve ever felt before and naturally because you’re already dead and in hell, you feel all of it without passing out. Your whole body shudders and you’re screaming to the point of tears. Big Red makes a few comments to you, which only he finds humorous.\n\nEventually he stops and pulls his arm out the extra large hole he’s made. You can’t stop crying and just bury your face in the pillows. While nowhere near as bad as it feels, the sounds you hear are horrible as well.\n\n“Yes, satisfying. Well you’re nice and loose now, guess it’s time for the real fun.” Big Red says and then shoves his big barbed dick into you, shattering part of your lower spine and ripping up whatever insides he didn’t destroy when he fisted you.\n\nAfter you don’t know how long, eventually Big Red pulls out. You think that’s finally the end of it, but then you feel a couple of clawed hands forcefully lift your head up out of the pillows. You already know what’s coming next…\n\nBig Red finishes his pleasure by ramming his dick into your mouth, breaking your jaw, shredding through your tongue and teeth. He releases down your throat, which burns your esophagus. You can’t scream out until he pulls out and when that happens you’re mostly just coughing and gagging up blood, seed and bits of flesh and teeth.\n\n“Well that was fun. I admit, I don’t normally indulge in this sort of base act, since I’m so busy with more important things, but we all slaves to urges I suppose. While I know you’re lying in a big puddle of your own mess right now, I suggest you just stay put until you heal up, which should be relatively soon. Then again your back is broken, I doubt if you could walk anyway. I tried to be as gentle as I could, but…well you know how it is when in the throes of passion.”\n\nYou can barely lift your head up to even look at Big Red, let alone speak.\n\n“In any case, I’ll be back later to ask your advice on some minor things I have going on. And if your advice proves useful, I’ll start consulting you on more important things. Of course if it doesn’t, well…”\n\nBig Red lifts your head up with a single hand under your broken jaw. He looks into your eyes and now you see an evil that pales in comparison to anything you ever managed to do.\n\n“Remember this.”\n\nWith those words, Big Red leaves you to wallow in your pain and poor judgment.\n\nTime passes and eventually your body does indeed completely regenerate, your mind however is another story.\n\nYour time in hell has just begun and worst part of all this isn’t the bodily torture or the threats of worse to come.\n\nThe worst part is you gave up. You think back that you allowed your moment of weakness to submit. You willingly became a slave in the hopes for a slightly better fate.\n\nYou could potentially become very useful to Big Red, but it won’t matter. The weight that you gave in will never go away and always torture you.\n\nEven with the loss of your soul, you were still ALIVE and could have tried to figure out another way to get out of the situation.\n\nBut you didn’t and now it’s too late.\n",
  "page 70": "You’re not out of this yet. Maybe he’s got the better of you for now, but you’ve been in the lesser position before and managed to come out on top.\n\nThis is going to be a lot more difficult, but you’ll figure out a way.\n\n“You might have my soul, but I’m not dead yet. You said it yourself, that I was probably heading to the infernal realm anyway so I don’t see any reason to be in a hurry there now just because I know which specific demon will have possession. I can still figure out a way to take back what it mine.”\n\nBig Red laughs.\n\n“While I’m willing to admit that such a thing can be done, it’s very difficult, especially with the fine print I put in there. Short of intervention of the most powerful of celestials…or heh…killing me in the infernal realm, I doubt very seriously you’d succeed. Still, it’s up to you. I’m almost interested to see if you’d come anywhere close to succeeding. In any case, I’ll open up the portal to the infernal realm and from there open up another one to a world similar to what this one used to be.”\n\nBig Red begins to cast, but then stops to address you again.\n\n“Silly question, but are you taking anyone with you? The contract did allow you to, though I can’t imagine you won’t be having the numbers you originally had in mind given that you’ve pissed off most, if not all of them.”\n\nAnd that’s when you see opportunity to regain your loss. Big Red just told you if you kill him in the infernal realm you’d get your soul back. It would be a tough battle just by yourself, especially in hell where he’s going to be his strongest, but with what remains of your people in this fortress, it should be enough to at least provide support and distraction for you to get a slight advantage.\n\nOf course you’ll wait until he opens the portal to the new world, no point in getting your soul back if you’re stuck in hell anyway.\n\n“Yes, I’ll assemble the remainder of the population of this fortress immediately.” You say.\n\nBig Red looks a little surprised, but he tells you to take the time you need as a deal’s a deal.\n\nYou immediately look to find Arrak who you are told is in one of the dens. When you find him, he’s sitting and just staring into a fireplace.\n\n“Arrak, we’re getting out of here, but I need you get the soldiers ready for what is going to be a very difficult battle.”\n“I carried out your orders and disposed of the body Mistress.” Arrak replies without looking at you.\n“Huh? What? Oh. Good, now…”\n“It reanimated before I threw it into the fire. It reached out to me making unnatural noises, presumably trying to strangle me with its little hands. Certainly couldn’t bite me.” Arrak chuckles a bit while still looking into the fire.\n“Yes. Amusing. Look, I need you to gather up everyone in this fortress and instruct them we have to kill a powerful demon before we’re finally free of all this shit. It’s opening a portal for us to hell, and from there it will open another one to the new world we’re going to, but we must kill it afterwards as soon as possible otherwise we’ll never be truly free. It…hey are fucking listening to me?!\n\nArrak continues to look into the fire, you notice a tear running down his cheek. You backhand him and then he looks over at you.\n\n“It was mine wasn’t it?” he asks.\n\nThis is NOT what you need right now. Out of ALL the males you could have matted with, you get the one who is attached to his spawn.\n\nYour instinct is to kill him for his weakness, but he’s currently the best warrior you got and you’ll need all the help you can get.\n\nYou sigh heavily.\n\n“Arrak, look. Sacrifices had to be made so our people could live. I didn’t tell you in the hopes that maybe you wouldn’t get attached. You don’t think I didn’t shed tears when I performed the deed? It was my baby too, but the greater good had to be served. Had things been different I would have come up with another plan, but there just wasn’t time. Now I NEED you with a sound mind and to get the other prepared, because where we’re going and what we’re about to do isn’t going to be easy. Understand?”\n\nArrak says nothing. You grab his chin and kiss him hard on the lips.\n\n“UNDERSTAND?!”\n\nIt snaps him out of his trance enough for him to finally look at you without the dead stare.\n\n“Yeah. Got it. Inform the others of the plan. Attack the demon after he opens the portal when we’re in hell.” He answers\n“Good. I knew I could count on you. And when we’re in the new world, maybe we’ll try again. We will have to repopulate our race after all.”\n\nYou leave hoping that the promise of another go at your hole of everlasting pleasure and living as some boring happy family is enough to keep him focused.\n\nYou eventually return to the summoning chamber where Big Red has opened a glowing dark red portal.\n\n“Ready to go when you are, how many are there anyway?” Big Red asks.\n“I think the count was one hundred and six, including myself.” You reply.\n“I see, and do you think that’s enough to replenish your race?”\n“I dunno. I would imagine so; we still have slightly more females than males I believe.”\n“Surpising given what you were doing with that half of your population with the Dero.”\n“Yeah, well the idiot males still tend to get themselves killed a lot more hence why there’s less of them. As for the females, I won’t be doing my part of the breeding process, I already did my part for motherhood by saving all their asses in the first place.”\n“Ah yes, you really did make the ultimate sacrifice for all of them didn’t you?”\n“Yes, and they better realize once and for all how lucky they have me to lead them.”\n“I’m sure they will, anyway are you ready to enter or are you going to wait for the others?”\n\nYou pause.\n\n“You seem eager for me to enter.” You say.\n“Well this is the only way to leave the world.” Big Red says.\n“I know that, but for all I know you’ve got a horde of demons on the other side waiting to rip me apart or I step into a lake of fire or something.”\n“My you have quite the imagination. No, the deal is the deal, if I broke this contract now, I’d lose your soul, not to mention suffer other negative repercussions. All of which wouldn’t be good after being so clever as to have gotten a hold of your soul in the first place.”\n“I suppose that even a prized soul like mine isn’t worth breaking a contract over. Fine, I’ll go in now.”\n“Very good, I’ll be along shortly, along with the rest of your people. I highly suggest though that you don’t stray too far away from where you appear on the other side. It’ll be safe in that area only, and I wouldn’t want to be responsible for any random mindless infernals that may be lurking nearby.”\n“Your concern is touching.”\n\nWith those words, you enter the portal….\n\nYou find yourself in a hostile looking wasteland with a red sky. It’s unbearably hot as well. In the distance your can see figures flying about and large black fortresses amongst the rocky landscape.\n\nStrange noises of all sorts come from various directions and you feel very vulnerable. It’s not a big improvement from where you just came from.\n\nAt first you think Big Red has broken the deal, but he eventually pops in near you along with several svelk. One of which is Arrak.\n\n“See? Told you, I’d be back. The rest of your people are still coming through the other portal, so more should be popping in. Might take awhile which is just as well since it’ll take time for me to open up the one to the world you lot are going to.”\n“Oh, and why is that?” you ask.\n“Contrary to popular belief, it’s not that common to open up portals from THIS side to other worlds like yours. Takes a lot of power and the only reason why I’m even able to rip open a portal to this one, is because the barriers there between this realm and it are a little weak right now, thanks to multiple succubus incursions there. In any case, I’d rather not be bothered while I do this, I’ll need to focus. Go talk to your people or something.” Big Red says and begins his task to open a portal to the new world.\n\nYou go over and do just that by speaking with Arrak who still looks a bit preoccupied, but after another talk with him, he seems for focused. He states everyone is ready; they just await your command of when to strike.\n\n“Good. Glad to hear it. Glad to see you also got the female part of our population to fall in line. Was slightly concerned those bitches might fuck things up. Other women tend to be jealous of me for whatever reason.”\n“Well, there won’t be any issues from them. We’ll await your orders Mistress.”\n\nThe remainder your time is spent mostly waiting around and mentally preparing yourself. You occasionally look over at Big Red who stays completely focused on opening the portal. He said it took a lot of power to open one from hell, hopefully that will put him in a weaker position when it’s time to attack.\n\nEventually Big Red opens the portal which is displaying a green field of grass and a blue sky. You can’t tell much else, but looks more pleasant than this place or your own world.\n\n“There you go. It’s open and ready for you to enter.” Big Red says.\n\nYou don’t say anything except nod and turn to look at Arrak who nods back. You move forward towards Big Red who stands near the portal.\n\nYou begin to whisper incantations under your breath and the magic in your hands starts to gather for an attack. Big Red folds his arms watching you.\n\nYou give the command.\n\n“Att..ack…”\n\nYou feel a sword go into your back, followed by several other sharp objects and a couple into your head as well.\n\nYou fall to the ground barely still alive at this point. All you hear are the angry voices of svelk going on about what a horrible bitch you are and other appropriate insults. You clearly hear Arrak’s voice shout something about the baby. You knew you should have killed him too.\n\nAs you feel kicks to your body and the rocks being pelted on you, you can’t believe it’s going to end like this. At least if you’d gotten killed in battle with Big Red there would have been a certain dignity in it.\n\nThe only bright side to any of it is knowing Big Red, he’s going to close the portal since with you dead, there’s no obligation for him to let the rest escape and they’ll be stranded here in hell.\n\nOf course that’s a small comfort compared to what Big Red has in store for you. Your failed attempt to try to kill him did not go unnoticed and when he has your soul, you soon learn what torment really is and in hell it’s nothing compared to whatever you inflicted on others in your old life.\n",
  "page 75": "At this point, you don’t care if the ugly little half-breeds will provide enough souls or not, Marzost’s continued improprieties can’t go unanswered.\n\nHe’s in a defensive position though right now; better if you put some distance between you and him first.\n\n“I’m going to go check on my men and see what’s keeping them.” You say.\n“Of course.” Marzost answers and watches you as you walk away.\n\nYou go over to your soldiers and find that they’ve got bags stuffed full of crystals.\n\n“Is this enough Mistress?” one of them asks.\n“Probably, but we’re taking it all and putting an end to the miserable existence of the dero. However, there’s a nursery with several halfbreeds. We’re taking them alive to be sacrificed. So don’t kill those.” You order.\n“Understood, so are we to attack now?”\n“No time like the present.”\n\nYou march out with your soldiers from the crystal piles and towards the heart of the dero dwellings. As you get closer, you see Marzost step out of one of the larger structures. It would appear Marzost already anticipated your attack.\n\n“Go home Mistress. This is your last warning.” Marzost shouts pointing a rifle at you.\n\nThere aren’t any other dero to be seen, but you know there have to be more lurking about, probably also aiming weapons at you. It’s not going to be easy, but you’re confident you can do this.\n\nYou take a deep breath and turn your head to nod at your nearest commander telling them all to stay as close to you as possible.\n\nYou cast a magical shield around your group which is no small feat given the magic nullifying stone in this place as well as how many people you’re trying to protect.\n\nMarzost fires at you and shouts at others to do so as well and just as you suspected, several shots ring out from other structures and probably a few hidden areas. The shots are stopped of course by the shield, though it doesn’t stop them from firing. The best you can do is just continue to advance. When the dero realize that they aren’t going to just be able to shoot you, several of them come out from their lurking and run to attack. Your magic shield is unable to stop them as they have anti-magic material built into their armor allowing them to bypass the barrier.\n\nThere aren’t many dero, but there doesn’t need to be, their armor, their strength, and sheer determination is more than a match for most of your soldiers which have been run ragged for weeks and are unfortunately lacking in similar traits in comparison.\n\nStill, this would not be enough to take out all your soldiers, let alone yourself even with the struggle of using magic.\n\nIt is however, enough to distract you long enough for Marzost and some of the female dero to throw several bombs into the mass of fighting. You notice just a little too late to completely extract yourself from the battle before they go off.\n\nSeveral explosions occur, killing most of your people and even a few dero despite their armor. Body parts and half charred bodies fly everywhere. The lucky ones are killed instantly; the unlucky ones are still living pieces of burnt flesh crying out in agony.\n\nWhen you land hard to the ground, you can barely see thanks to your eyes being severely injured along with most of your face. You can only guess you have no legs or at least nothing intact enough to stand on, though it would be difficult to get up anyway given that you’re fairly sure your spine has been shattered.\n\nYou lift one of your arms and even with the blurriness you see it literally fall apart as flesh just slides off what remains of it before part of it falls over at the elbow hanging uselessly, only connected by a bit of tendon. As for your other arm, who knows, you can’t move it and you can’t even turn your head in that direction to get a blurry look.\n\nFrom your position, you can’t really inspect your torso, but you’re guessing it isn’t good since you’re struggling to breath. You feel like whatever remains of you is on fire, but you can’t even muster up the strength to scream out in pain.\n\nEventually you notice a figure of some sort standing over you. You’re guessing its Marzost. You think he’s talking to you, but you can’t hear shit mainly because your eardrums have been destroyed from the blast and you’re bleeding from what remains of your ears. You attempt to say something, but can only gurgle and choke on your own blood.\n\nYour last sight is the blurry figure of Marzost pointing a pistol at your face.\n",
  "page 132": "Well Alec doesn’t seem to be in a rush, so why should you? Probably best you do interact with Alec more anyway so you can continue evaluating him.\n\nYou begin to go into your past a little bit more. You mention the orphanage and what ultimately led you to the Nuro magic college. Basically the same story you told Mr. Demar when he asked about you.\n\nAlec for his part listens quietly, only interrupting for clarification on some things. About the only thing you really don’t mention is the Dark Order, especially since you probably said too much just mentioning it when you initially met. Eventually you finish up your tale.\n\n“Well, you’ve certainly had an interesting life for your short time here. Honestly a lot more interesting than mine, before I was turned of course.” Alec says.\n“Interesting I suppose would be one way of describing it.” You reply.\n\nAlec starts to say something, but then stops himself. Of course this causes you to continue.\n\n“Well…I was going to ask what exactly the Dark Order was since you mentioned it when you thought I was spying on you for the clans. But I suppose you left it out of your story for a reason so I won’t press the issue.”\n“Is this your attempt to get me to trust you better?”\n“Is it working?”\n“Heh. Somewhat. All I’ll say is they’re currently the closest thing to family and despite my mixed feelings about them, I have grown in my magical abilities thanks to them.”\n“Yeah, I suppose I could say something similar about the clans. I don’t agree with a lot of the stuff they do, but my existence is probably better now due to being involved with them at one time. Probably would have just drank myself to death if I hadn’t been turned.”\n“Funny, now you drink to live.”\n\nThis causes Alec to laugh out loud.\n\n“See? This is why I was drawn to you.” Alec says.\n“I thought it was my deathly aura.” You say.\n“That too, but I could just tell you were going to be an engaging person and I was right.”\n“Thought you said I was like all the other necromancers you encountered.”\n“Eh, I mean you put on that front, but there’s much more after you let that wall down, I do wonder though, what exactly draws you to necromancy? I mean in just about every case, necromancers are always in it to dominate and power. But you obviously don’t care too much about those things.”\n“I suppose I find a beauty in death. Always have even as far back when I saw those grave wings eating that dead cat.”\n\nAlec nods and smiles a bit. You look at him and return the smile. He reaches out to touch your hand, you’re hesitant at first, but then something about this seems to make perfect sense.\n\nYou take his hand, which is cool to the touch. His other hand covers yours and you look at each other again knowing there is a connection.\n\n“Catalina, I have no ill intent. I only want to spend time with you.”\n\nYou believe him.\n\nAlec stands up, still holding your hand. You follow his example and stand up as well.\n\n“I have a place in the city I go to when I’m here. We can go there together.”\n\nYou nod and follow Alec out the bar and to the destination, which you soon learn, is a crypt. This doesn’t really surprise you though and it certainly doesn’t bother you. If anything you feel even more comfortable here.\n\nYou and Alec get to a nicer part of the crypt, which has a very fancy coffin with a comfortable looking interior.\n\n“I’m afraid I only have the one coffin available, but trust me, there’s definitely room for two.” Alec says.\n\nYou don’t say anything. You just continue to stare at him. In fact there’s a part of you that realizes you stopped avoiding his gaze as much when you started talking about yourself.\n\nAs he approaches closer and wraps his arms around you tightly, you also realize you’ve fallen under said gaze. That part of your brain is screaming for you to break away, but it’s too late. He’s managed to slowly and subtlety get you under his control.\n\nAlec senses your powerless resistance.\n\n“Don’t worry Catalina, I didn’t lie. I mean you no ill intent. You’ll see that this will be the best thing for you and then we can be together forever in death.” Alec says.\n\nAlec then quickly lunges at your neck and everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell that was certainly foolish letting a vampire lure you into a conversation like that. In fact that whole event in your life was pretty foolish. You were lucky things didn’t turn out like that.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 112": "This fool sought to harm you and now he begs for his miserable life? It doesn’t matter if he was just weak willed follower, he must now pay the debt for his poor judgment.\n\nYou feel the surge of power and you fully intend on using it. Now everyone will learn of your power. You wave your hand at the begging coward and slam him against the wall again. He’s not dead, but he slumps down from the force of the blow.\n\nYou then focus on Jaxon’s corpse.\n\n“I’ve done this before, I can do this properly now. Rise.” You utter.\n\nYou then see the dead body twitch. You focus more and then it stands back up completely under your power. You’ve done it.\n\nYou command the corpse of Jaxon to walk towards the last living member of the gang who is barely conscious, but when sees that which should be dead approaching he starts to try to gather himself, but it’s too late as the corpse starts to attack him.\n\nHe manages to let out one scream before it rips his throat out. You then try to focus on his body and bring him back as well.\n\nIt’s all very easy now. You raise this one up immediately, just in time too because the city guards have showed up thanks to all the noise . You command the two corpses you raised to attack and cast a few offensive spells.\n\nYou take down a few of them, but the city guards are tougher than a simple street gang made up of teenagers. And of course this being Nuro, the city guards do have a bit of skill in magic of their own.\n\nEventually your corpses are cut down, more guards arrive and you are overwhelmed. You feel a couple of well-placed blows causing you to crumple to the ground where you are held down by the guards. You struggle but it’s no use, and you’re unable to cast any spells.\n\nYou fully expect to be killed on the spot given that you’ve just displayed necromancy, but then one of the guards speaks.\n\n“Calm down girl, we’re not here to hurt you. We’re on your side.” The guard says.\n“What?” you respond.\n\nThe guard then lifts his helmet, and it’s that of a skull. It occurs to you how every guard has a full-face helm, which they are all now lifting up.\n\nSkeletal faces are revealed and then a deep surrounding voice is heard.\n\n“We just think you’re going about this the wrong way. Your time will come Catalina and soon you will earn your place in this soon to be dead world.” You hear and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell your life certainly didn’t turn out like that. You’re fairly certain that you wouldn’t have been able to raise two corpses at that point anyway. You still had a ways to go before you could do it with such ease. More than likely you would have been executed for being so open with raising the dead.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 111": "No. You need to get out of here. With the screams and the fire, you’ve probably drawn enough attention already.\n\nYou quickly pick up your purse and run off before anyone important actually arrives to see you.\n\nYou run without any particular idea of where to go, so you do what comes natural and go to your old place in the park. Fortunately there’s nobody making out there and you have solitude.\n\nYou can’t stay here forever though. It’s not even that far away from the incident you just created so you need to move soon anyway. You think you probably should leave the city like you once briefly thought about before. You’d probably be able to handle yourself even better now given your recent actions.\n\nStill though, something about that idea still fills you with anxiety. Maybe it’s the idea that you just left your home INSIDE the city and the idea of leaving Nuro entirely is just too much right now.\n\nYou can’t stay in the lower class areas of Nuro though; you’re just going to get into more trouble eventually. While you’ve never really focused on your looks, you’re aware enough that you’d attract more unwanted attention from folks like that Jaxon degenerate and you doubt you’d be able to always contain yourself like you did just now.\n\nWhich means you need to go to a different part of the city entirely. You’d stick out in the richer areas though given your clothing. Though you suppose you could buy yourself or even steal yourself something better to blend in, you still need a permanent place of residence.\n\nThen it occurs to you where you’d be able to easily find someplace to hide and still be moderately comfortable.\n\nThe Nuro Magic College.\n\nIt’s huge from what you’ve heard; people of all types are there and you could easily just say you’re touring the campus as a prospective student if someone questions you.\n\nThe best thing is it’s dedicated to magic; perhaps you’d be able to better learn something there even if you had to just pilfer a few magic books. You’ve managed to teach yourself this long, no reason why you couldn’t still do it.\n\nWith a new plan in mind, you feel a little better and get up off the grass. You then proceed with your path.\n\nThe first step is indeed getting new clothes. You decide to go the legitimate route and actually buy them. You also buy a small backpack in the process. You get a few odd looks from the merchants, but happily they’re more interested in your coin than anything else.\n\nYou also get something to eat and drink since you haven’t done so all day.\n\nThe next step is actually travelling to the college itself. By the time you even get to the outskirts of it, it’s already starting to get dark. There’s a lot more people roaming about. Still older than you, but you figure in a few more years or so, you should fit in even better.\n\nYou’re a little tired from today’s events though, so you start to wonder where you can sleep. There are dorms, but you don’t think you’d be able to even sneak into one of those. You actually do see several students just sleeping on couches or chairs in various places. Overworked from studying no doubt.\n\nAs the day grows darker, you see less people wandering around outside at night or else they’re all gathered at various buildings with loud noise coming from them. You assume parties are expected in a college.\n\nYou walk through an area which reminds you a bit of the Nuro park except perhaps more open area for larger crowds to gather and no signs telling people to not stray off a path.\n\nAs you’re struggling to stay awake, you hear voice.\n\n“You girl! You look a little young to be at this college. Though you’re certainly at the right spot to learn your craft.”\n\nYou turn and see a demon! Or rather what you’ve heard demons look like since you’ve never seen one in person. Though he’s dressed like a regular person, nothing excessively intimidating about him except his inhuman facial appearance.\n\nStill, even you know their reputation and you back away, once again thinking you’ll be relying on your magic. The demon however just shakes his head and and puts his hands up.\n\n“Heh, I wouldn’t bother girl, I don’t mean you any harm and you wouldn’t be any match anyway. I’m just out here doing business, trying to make my way in this world like everyone else. They call me Big Red around here. What’s your name?” The demon says.\n“A lot of people claim they don’t mean any harm and they do it anyway.” You answer.\n“Well that’s true. I guess you’re a sharp one. Though that still leaves the question of why a young girl such as yourself is wandering the Nuro campus at night. I can sense you have a bit of magic about you, but again you’re a little too young to be a student here.”\n“Trying to make my way in the world like everyone else.”\n“Ah, okay. Tight lipped too. Well, I suggest that if you’re going to hang out here that you find some place a little more secluded for the night. The best place is probably the old library; it’s to the far east of this area. You can’t miss it; it’s an ugly old crumbling building with a bunch of broken windows surrounded by untended grounds.”\n“Sounds much different than the other buildings I’ve seen here.”\n“Well, they were supposed to tear it down or repurpose it when the new one got built decades ago, but it’s just been crumbling into decay for many years now. Some say they keep it around for nostalgia purposes, others say it’s cursed so it’s best not to mess with it. Personally I think it was just a case of red tape and laziness.”\n“Wait, cursed?”\n“Oh yeah. That’s where the Great Lich Lord got his start centuries ago. You’ve never heard this story?”\n\nYou shake your head, thinking back to how you ignored most of the tales of the evils of magic from Miss Olga and how that particular story was part of the reason for her views.\n\n“Oh, well it’s a long tale, so I’ll give you the short version. Basically the Great Lich Lord who nearly brought death to the world centuries before you were even born used to work there as a simple librarian. I guess he started looking a little too much at some of the dark magic tomes that happily used to be more accessible and getting ideas in his head. Then one day he just stopped coming into work. He was an isolated man of little importance in the scheme of things so he wasn’t missed and just replaced.”\n\nYou listen with great interest as Big Red continues his story.\n\n“Well a few years later EVERYONE soon knew of him, because he’d amassed an army of undead like this world had never seen. Things were so grim for a while that my people were even brought in to help. That went about as well as it always does though.“ Big Red chuckles.\n“So…how was he beaten?” you ask.\n“Oh it was combination of several things, but I’d say vampires were his main downfall. The alliance he had with them just wasn’t going to last. Sure they might be undead, but those biped leeches need the living in order to survive. Realizing if he won, it would be a bad thing, the bloodsuckers came to their senses and basically assassinated the guy. And like with all things involving necromancy, if you kill the leader, you effectively eliminate the entire problem.”\n“Wait. Vampires?”\n“Yeah. That’s not one they really tell in most versions of the story mainly because the vamps themselves keep it that way as they continue to hide and play puppet master to human governments. Oh sure there’s stories of so called heroes ultimately bringing him down, but they were vampires and they were saving their own undead asses.”\n“Wouldn’t something like that for something so important be more well known?”\n“By who girl? All the people that managed to survive the Dead War died long ago of natural causes by now. Even elves as long lived as they are and I doubt if even most of them knew what was really going on. Humans dominate the world with their pitiful life spans and even more pitiful memories of what came before, so with the vampires manipulating shit, the truth is theirs to control. Still, even immortality is no cure for short sightedness.”\n\nBig Red suddenly looks as if he’s not completely focused on the conversation.\n\n“What do you mean?” you ask.\n“Nothing. Anyway, just be careful where you step in that library and you should be fine.” Big Red says.\n“And you’re claiming this is a good place for me to go to?”\n“I didn’t claim it was a good place, I’m saying it’s the best place to go if you don’t want to draw attention.”\n“You seem eager for me to go there.”\n“Look Catalina, I’m just making a suggestion. The choice is yours if you want to sleep there or not. I mean you could take your chances and just find one of the couches in one of the study areas to crash on, but if you’re found sleeping in a more public area, someone might question it and you don’t want to suddenly find yourself grabbed by Nuro college security while you’re dozing.”\n\nYou step back again.\n\n“How did you know my name?” you ask.\n“You told me.” He says with complete confidence.\n“No I didn’t.”\n“Pretty sure you did, but in any case, I need to get back to business, I’m sure some of the usual crowd are going to want their hobgoblin hashish soon and I can’t have a little moppet like you lurking about, so away with you.”\n\nBig Red waves you away as if you’re an annoyance.\n\nYour first encounter with a demon and you can say that while it wasn’t an overly threatening experience, you’re a little unnerved by it a bit. Big Red seemed like he was helping you, but confusing you at the same time. You wonder if all his kind are like that.\n\nAnd you are most definitely certain that you did not tell him your name. Maybe he can read minds?\n\nIn any case, he’s still correct in the choice is ultimately yours if you want to spend the night as the abandoned library or not.\n",
  "page 114": "Probably a bad idea following the advice of a demon, but you’re tired and if you’re being honest, you’re a little curious about the library now after hearing the story.\n\nYou make your way to the east side of the campus and Big Red wasn’t lying, even in the dark, you can see it looming in the distance. In fact it sort of sits away from the rest of the buildings.\n\nThe closer you get, the grass becomes a bit more overgrown and wild. All of the vegetation is like that. You sort of wonder why since you have to think it would be a simple matter to keep it looking neat with some spells. This is a magic college after all. Maybe Big Red is correct in that it is just a simple case of laziness.\n\nCautiously you approach the library only to find most of the steps leading up are half broken and uneven. The front door also has giant chain with a lock on it. Not a big deal since you just gesture your hands and focus a bit until you hear a click. You see the chain fall and enter. Not really the best security for a magic school if they wanted to keep people out, but again maybe it really is just laziness and apathy.\n\nThe moonlight shining in from the broken windows provides a bit of light, but not much. You definitely do have to watch your step as the wooden floor you’re walking on creaks and isn’t very strong in some places as you quickly remove your foot when it feels like it’s going fall through. Outright holes to what you assume is to a lower level of the library are also present.\n\nYou see a couple of stairways to upper levels, but in one case, nearly nothing is left of the steps themselves. You’re not really in the mood to explore right now though, especially in the dark, so the ground floor it is.\n\nYou make your way past several bookcases, most of which are predictably empty. So far other than it being in great disrepair, there’s nothing magical about the library. Of course that doesn’t mean there isn’t danger since you do hear noises occasionally which sound like the predictable squeaking and scurrying of multiple of rats\n\nEventually you find what was probably a staff room. Some dusty furniture is still around and a serviceable couch is available for you to flop down on.\n\nAnd it’s just enough weight to cause the weak wooden floor to completely give way causing you take a trip downward until you hit the bottom of the basement.\n\nFortunately you’re more or less unhurt thanks to the sturdy couch and its remarkably intact cushions. Unfortunately, you’re now in complete darkness and the sounds of those rats are a lot closer.\n\nYou never really got the hang of casting “light” since the last thing you wanted to do is potentially attract Miss Olga’s attention when you were practicing magic at night in your room. Not to mention you never seemed to be able to make a bright light, the best you could ever do was emulate the dark purple glow of a Gravewing, so that’s what you do.\n\nA ball of purple light illuminates a small part of the darkness and besides debris, you only see a lot of metal cabinets. Or you assume there’s a lot of them, sort of hard to tell when you can only see the immediate area around you.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is find a way back up and out of here because you’re already hearing chittering noises getting closer. You spin around and see small figures scurry nearby.\n\nUnlike the weak wood of the ground floor, the basement floor is solid stone, so you waste no time in quickly getting out of this area and looking for a way back up. Of course since you still can’t see very well and there’s debris all over, you’re still tripping every other step until you finally just fall into a pile of bones. A lot of bones.\n\nIn fact, upon picking yourself up and getting a better look, these bones aren’t even of animals. Some of them are clearly humanoid. You look around some more and see a large hole in the wall and it’s large enough for something bigger than rats to come in and out of.\n\nThen you feel a blow to the back your head causing you to stagger and then collapse once again.\n\nYou’re not sure how much time passes, but when you come to a large cooking fire provides the lighting with a sizable pot hanging over it nearby. You can’t tell where you are exactly, but you know that you’re in a cage and not in the library anymore, looks like you’re still underground though.\n\nYou also see hunched figures standing near the cooking fire. You can’t quite make out what they are, but they’re not human based on their rodent like appearance.\n\n“Skeez, we don’t need no more rat in da pot! Dat’s the whole point of havin da girl!” one of them says.\n“Thought she was for breedin’, purposes.” Skeez says.\n“Gaw said she’s fer eatin, not breedin!”\n“Gaw ALWAYS says that, I think Gaw doesn’t like girls. Probably ruttin wit Qeesh right now.”\n“Shhhh! Don’t let him hear you say dat! He’ll eat YOU!”\n“Pfft, not scared of ‘im! Anyways, the clan has lasted fer a long time, hell we even survived most of the Dead War nonsense on the surface, but it ain’t gonna last too much longer if we don’t start makin more babies. I don’t get why we don’t just grab some dumb ass college girls.”\n“Cuz we ain’t supposed to attract attention. Rich college kids missing might cause some to go looking.”\n“Well fine, we could always use the tunnels to grab some whores down in the poor section of Nuro, nobody’s gonna miss them. It’s weird, Gaw is all for nabbing people off the street to put in da pot, but when it comes to actually thinking about the future of the clan, he does nothing. There’s only what, six of us left now? In the past our clan used to be much larger!”\n“Yeah but den there’s wuz all dat in fighting and even dat purge that tried to wipe us all out. Gaw says we can’t risk dat ever happening again.”\n“There won’t be nuthin left ta risk if we don’t replenish our numbers soon. We’re not getting any younger either.”\n“Hrm, maybe you right. But dis one still for da pot. She look too young for breedin anyway.”\n“From what I saw of her, she’s barely fer eatin’ given how skinny she is. I don’t even like humie meat. Rats taste betta. Even one of doze greenskins would be betta.”\n“You gots weird tastes, Skeez.”\n\nWhile you were busy eaves dropping, you didn’t notice a third rat thing sitting quietly in the shadows.\n\n“Hey, you two might wanna shut up, becuz the meat’s awake an listening to everything you’re fucking saying.”\n\nAt this point the other two look over at you as the third one steps out into the firelight.\n\n“Well so she is. Good, better to kill her while she kickin’. Fear make the meat taste better.\n\nAs the three rat men approach, you back up and prepare to cast your tried and true attack spell.\n\nOnly for Skeez to start chuckling and make a wave with his own hand, forming a brief blue barrier over himself and his fellows. A protective magic shell of some kind.\n\n“What girlie? Youz think we don’t know you don’t have magic or know it? The clan hasn’t been living near the fucking university for so long in secret without knowin da arts! An while I can sense youz a little more talented fer a humie yer age, you ain’t no match…hmmm. Mebbe you SHOULD be breedin stock.” Skeez says.\n“Skeez, we been over dis.” The one that was arguing with him says.\n“YOU been over dis Krech! I said I ain’t scared of Gaw and we NEED more babies to make the clan live again! This magic girl is young and could probably survive several birthins an her magical blood would only enhance da young! Me and Gaw are the only two with any sort of abilities left an’ he’d rather just smash someone in da head. No, I’m sayin, we keep her for breeding stock and I’m gonna have da first crack at her.”\n\nWhile the three rat things start arguing about what unsavory action they exactly want to do with you, you once again reminded of what happened earlier with the thugs that tried to assault you in the alley. It was different there. There would have been witnesses and it was out in the open.\n\nHere? There are no witnesses, and nobody is going to miss these parasites of civilization. You look around and see all the bones nearby, there’s more than enough here and a magic barrier isn’t going to protect them from what you have in mind…\n\n“LOOK, WEES GONNA EAT ‘ER AN DATS IT! Dats whut Gaw said!” Krech shouts.\n“Dats whut Gaw said. You hear yerself? You takin it in the rump too or you just so far up his, dat you not think fer yerself anymore?” Skeez asks.\n“Again, would you two shut the…”\n\nSuddenly a large rat thing enters with a couple of smaller ones.\n\n“What the hell is all dis noise? I’m tryin ta sleep an you lot are squeeking loud enough to wake the fucking dead!”\n\nA very accurate choice of last words.\n\nBefore any of the rat things can answer their fearless leader, Skeez is impaled by the sharp bones of the half skeletons you’ve managed to raise.\n\nYou go into a complete trance raising every single half eaten corpse you can in the lair. It isn’t much and it’s causing you a great deal of energy, but it’s enough to cause the ratmen to panic and lose their shit before putting up any sort of proper resistance.\n\n“Bitch! Youz doin’ dis!” Gaw shouts and smashes aside one of the boney attackers. Gaw does his best to rush at your cage, he even manages to rip the door open, but the big rat man eventually falls to the onslaught his former dinner choices.\n\nThe dead however are proving somewhat difficult for you to control directly. You hold them back from attacking you and then completely release your power of their animation, giving you a bit of you energy back. You were tired before, now you’re exhausted and your short “nap” from getting knocked out didn’t help.\n\nYou stagger out of the cage nearly ready to collapse, but you don’t because you still hear something.\n\nYou go over to the cooking fire which is still burning brightly and heating pot, the bodies of the rat men lie on the floor, but only one is still barely alive. It’s Skeez and he’s coughing up blood along with bleeding from several vital areas of his body. He’s not long for this world. You pick up a nearby broken leg bone. The rat weakly raises a hand and attempts to speak in between the wheezing.\n\nYou aren’t interested in his words, especially after what he had in store. You bring the leg bone down on his head until his head is split open and his brains are leaking out his ears.\n\nWhen it’s done, you toss the bone aside and stagger down one of the tunnels, managing to muster up a bit of purple light like you did last time. Fortunately the tunnel you picked leads back to the library basement.\n\nEventually you make your way back to where the couch fell and lay down on it to sleep, like you originally wanted to. You turn out the light and if any rats of any kind have any notions of eating you (or anything else) you can’t be bothered to do anything about it because you’re out of it.\n\nFortunately when you wake up, you’re in one piece and none the worse for wear. Or at least not in any worse condition than you were before.\n\nSome light shines down from the hole above, so it must at least be daytime now and you’re reminded that you still need to get back up the ground floor, though that should be easier now at least.\n\nYou still feel a little woozy, but you feel better in general. It’s like you finally reawakened something that needed to be unleashed, if only on a minor scale.\n\nYou realize now, that you need to pursue this branch of magic regardless of where it leads you. You aren’t even sure how you’re going to control it better or grow in power, but surely you will learn more about magic here in what is considered to be the greatest magical learning center of the world.\n\nYou don’t even have a plan for the future, but you feel very strongly that it all starts here for you.\n\nThis will be your home until you figure it all out.\n",
  "page 115": "Yeah, you’re not following this demon’s advice. You’ll take your chances sacking out in one of the student study areas.\n\nDoesn’t actually take you long to find a relatively secluded area, which doesn’t even have anyone hanging out at it. You find a sofa and make yourself comfortable. You don’t go to sleep right away due to expecting someone to bother you, but eventually your tiredness wins out.\n\nYou sleep for quite awhile and when you wake up you find that nothing has happened. It’s morning and there’s still nobody even in this room. Not too bad for the first night.\n\nThe spend the rest of the day learning the layout of the university. You still maintain a low profile though as there’s no reason to be foolish. One of your major stops though is the library (and not the abandoned one Big Red told you to sleep in).\n\nThis is going to be the first step to your expanded knowledge of magic. You can probably easily read through a few books in a quiet part of the library or even nab a few of the books if needed.\n\nDays…weeks…months pass?\n\nYou actually aren’t sure how much time has gone by. Things are hazy as you’re constantly on the move trying to sneak about trying to keep a low profile yet not really having a “place” to rest for a long period of time.\n\nSleeping in empty classrooms, bathroom stalls, under bleachers or even maintenance closets might keep a low profile, but it’s not very comfortable and you wake up achy every time you do it. Which in turn makes studying any sort of magic without proper rest a bit more of a chore.\n\nSleeping in study areas hasn’t been without drawbacks either. Granted, you try to be careful with picking one, but you can’t do it flawlessly all the time and there’s been more than one occasion where you’ve awakened to others being in the room with you.\n\nMost of the time they’re just students that ignore you. At most you might get some odd looks (as you do walking on campus sometimes) but there’s been on more than one occasion that someone much older, probably faculty has actually awakened you asking who you are.\n\nYou’ve managed to lie a few times saying you’re the little sister of one of the students here and that you either got lost or your older sibling said they would be right back.\n\nThe lies vary as needed, and while you’re fairy good at thinking them up and evading further questioning, the truth is, you’re becoming more noticeable.\n\nAnd eventually the day comes where your presence is no longer ignored. You’ve stolen enough books from the library and sacked out in the open enough that even the campus guards start putting things together.\n\nYou barely manage to wake up in time to see several campus guards along with a member of the faculty heading towards the couch you’re sleeping on.\n\nYou don’t think, you just cast a blast of flame at the group, but one of them simply waves her hand up to block your attack. You turn to run only to feel frozen in place. You can’t move at all no matter how hard you try.\n\nThe stern looking female professor approaches you and motions the guards to rummage through your backpack, which of course has stolen library books.\n\n“So the little thief thinks she’s also a wizard eh? What other powers do you believe you have?” she asks.\n\nYou say nothing.\n\n“Come now, I just froze your body, you can still speak. In fact you better start doing so before your frozen state becomes permanent.”\n\nYou still say nothing and just focus on her.\n\n“The university takes a dim view on stolen property and an even dimmer view on attacking staff. Answer me now and you MIGHT only escorted off the campus and delivered to the nearest juvenile detention center.”\n\nYou focus; trying tap into that darkness that you know is in you. And it’s not just pretty balls of flame or flashes of energy.\n\nThe professor continues to drone on about how much trouble you’re in, but soon she’s going to know just how much trouble she’s in…\n\nAnd that’s when her nose starts to bleed. She then reels back in pain and feels her face which if she could see, she’d probably be more horrified. As it stands she sees how withered her hands are and that’s enough to break her concentration allowing you to get free.\n\n“Nec..NECROMANCER! STOP HER!” she cries as you make a break for the closest door.\n\nYou make a good run for it, but ultimately your actions of casting necromantic magic has made you an even bigger threat. The college wastes no time raising an alarm of the situation and it isn’t long before the entire city is on lockdown making even escape impossible.\n\nThough you aren’t a fugitive for long as eventually you are captured. Due to your age however, you aren’t killed (even if there was some long debate about doing that too) you’re instead taken to some sort of asylum.\n\nYou’re defiant the entire time, but eventually you’re given a shot of something placed under sort of drug or spell, which completely clears your mind. You no longer think about magic or anything really.\n\nThey’ve completely lobotomized you.\n\nOr so they think.\n\nYou still see it in your mind. The darkness. The death. It’s all still there. They can’t stop it. It’s coming. Turning you into a turnip has failed. You’ll get out of here at some point and that’s when it’ll really get fun.\n\nYou see visions of gravewings flutter before you and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell that wasn’t exactly pleasant. Certainly wasn’t how your life went thankfully. Still, getting thrown into an asylum is definitely something that could have happened had you not been as careful.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 118": "Those were some interesting years of your life.\n\nSneaking about the campus, stealing a magic book here and there, teaching yourself in secret like you had been, but now you at least had some sort of instruction. You managed to figure out a lot more than the inherent talents you seemed to have (Most of which were on the destructive side of things).\n\nYou learned more about magic in general; indeed you probably were a better all around wizard even if you still had much to learn.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t the other branches of magic you were concerned about mastering. It was the one you were called to.\n\nWhile you had some progress, it wasn’t much. The best you could do is animate a few deceased things like a dead rat, partial corpses or if you really focused an intact corpse like when you practiced with one of the dead rat men, but in doing so, they nearly got their revenge on you.\n\nThere weren’t exactly books on necromancy lingering around despite looking for them. You learned a bit of a substitute by studying up on enchantment and trying to control the dead using the same concepts. It worked to a limited degree (at least enough to not get yourself killed) but charming the living and controlling the dead are still very different things.\n\nStill, it was definitely a branch of magic that came in useful on more than one occasion. Especially since you’ve been encountering some difficulty walking about on campus.\n\nBack when you were living in the orphanage you started scaring the other children even though you never really did anything to them. You’re starting to have that affect on grown people.\n\nYou aren’t really social so you didn’t really notice it at first, but recently it’s been getting to the point where you’re just walking around and people are going out their way to avoid walking near you.\n\nIt’s becoming more of a problem more so on the campus due to making the college security starting to take more notice of you and they were doing that anyway due to your age. (Though that reason is less of an issue now)\n\nYou’ve been sticking to only walking around on the campus at night now and if you have to go out during the day, you stick to other parts of the city where there’s less chance of getting hassled by magic watchmen at least.\n\nOn top of all this, you still aren’t sure what your major plans are. You have this desire to master necromancy, but even when you do, then what? It’s not really like you can practice it out in the open or use it for anything other than the obvious and even if you did, it would be a one way ticket for you to be targeted by the civilized world.\n\nNot like you can really speak to anyone about any of this though.\n\nAnd yet, you can’t be the only person like this. There has to be others like you, maybe they’re all hidden though. You imagine anyone that has your sort of power is probably hiding out from major areas of civilization.\n\nThe only lead you can think of is to potentially ask a demon on campus who tend to be a little more knowledgeable about these things, the problem is most tend to want something in return.\n\nThere aren’t many of them and they typically working as janitors other than Big Red and you’re really reluctant to ask him, given his advice years ago that nearly got you killed or worse.\n\nYou’ve avoided him since that night, but you always hear his name pop up from time to time on campus as the one to go to if you really need something. Oddly he’d probably be the least demanding in price since he doesn’t ask for someone’s soul as payment. (Well at least not usually)\n\nEventually you come to the conclusion you’ll ask him and you figure if you don’t like the price or answer, you can always do your own thing as usual.\n\nSo you wait until nightfall and you go to the spot where Big Red can typically be found selling whatever he’s offering.\n\nBefore you even reach him, you see him looking up and even sniffing a bit, then he looks over in your direction.\n\n“Whoa…you smell DISGUSTING.” Big Red says covering his nose.\n“Excuse me?” you say.\n“You fucking REEK of rotting death! Granted it’s pleasant smell when it’s a battlefield full of dead bodies, but something about you necromancers always ruin it and never fail to give off a foul aura. Ugh.”\n\nYou start to sniff at yourself and smell nothing out of the ordinary. While granted you live in an abandoned library and have been practicing raising the dead from time to time, you’re fairly regular on your hygiene habits.\n\n“I’ll have you know I keep myself regularly clean!” you protest.\n“Girl, you still have much to learn about your powers. You could immerse yourself in all the water in the world and adorn yourself with the fanciest perfume and you’d still smell like a horde of rotting bodies. It’s not your body odor; it’s your magical aura. Superior magical beings such as myself can sense it better than most. Though I’d wager your deathly aura is starting to become strong enough for even these moron mortals that claim to be masters of magic to start to sense.”\n\nYour brief glance downward signifies that to be the case even if you didn’t know why exactly until Big Red explained it. Also explains why that demonic janitor called you a stinking bitch when you walked by one last week. You figured he was just being an asshole. (Well he still was as far as you’re concerned)\n\nIn any case it’s obvious Big Red knows all about your situation so you get to the point.\n\n“Look, I need to know if there are others like me, do you have that information?” you ask.\n“Right to it huh? You know you never did thank me for my free advice years ago when you were a younger ragamuffin. I’m sure sacking out in that old library rent free with nobody really bothering you has been serving your purposes well.” Big Red says.\n“You didn’t tell me about the ratmen living there.”\n“And how would I know what was living in there? I never forced you to go there either, you made that choice. I merely pointed it out. Looks like you must have handled them though and grew stronger from it. But rather than even a thanks, you just come here demanding shit. Well that’s not how this works Catalina.”\n“Pretty sure I STILL never told you my name either.”\n“And I’m pretty sure you did, so what do you want exactly? You want to know if there are others like you? Of course there are. Your kind always exists in some manner. Drawn to death like grave wings. Now if you want to know if there are any on campus? Well, the answer to that is yes as well. In fact, there’s a whole cabal of them. They’re a lot better at hiding their stench though, hence why they’re freely walking about on campus not driving everyone away. Hell, I’m actually surprised one of them hasn’t contacted you yet. Of course I’m equally surprised the campus security hasn’t sensed you yet given that you’re a walking mortuary. Then again they’ve never been the brightest with sensing magic auras.”\n\nWell that was actually easier than you thought. You didn’t think Big Red would give you the information so casually or that it would even be so close.\n\n“So where are they exactly” you ask.\n“What, you want me to draw you a map? Track them down yourself, shouldn’t be hard even for you. I’ve already given you free advice TWICE now. You want more information, you’re going to have to reciprocate.”\n“Alright, so what do you want exactly? And no, I’m not giving you my soul OR my body.”\n“Pfft, what do you take me for, one of those losers cleaning toilets? Your soul isn’t worth much, and while your virginity might entice some, you are not my type. You couldn’t handle what I got anyway.”\n“Well what do you want then?”\n“Simple really, I need you to deliver this to someone. I’d do it myself, but I’m honestly too busy with other things.”\n\nBig Red pulls out a black cube with ornate gold carvings on it from his coat.\n\n“They already paid for it, so just drop it off and come back.”\n“Wait, where would I be taking it?”\n“Oh, Mr. Demar’s office. He’s head of the conjuration department. I’m sure you’re familiar with the building.”\n“Can’t say I’ve ever lingered around over there.”\n“Hm, I suppose that’s not surprising. Anyway, deliver that and you’ll get your information.”\n\nYou’re a little leery of all this and immediately Big Red senses this.\n\n“Or don’t and get the fuck out of here anyway because once again you’re driving away business.”\n\nBig Red puts the cube back in his coat pocket and waves you away.\n\nIf Big Red thinks you’re going to change your mind and take whatever that item is, he’s sadly mistaken.\n\nOr maybe you should just leave Nuro entirely and make your own way, especially if things are getting dicey to stick around here. While Nuro may very well be a large center of magic in the world, it isn’t the entire world. Surely there is more out there after all.\n",
  "page 117": "A strong memory surfaces of you standing over Miss Olga’s grave pondering your past. (Not unlike what you’re doing right now actually)\n\nYou aren’t even exactly sure when she died, you just knew she did. Granted she did tell you she was dying soon, but you doubt you would have managed to locate her grave so easily without your growing attunement to death.\n\nYou made your way to the Nuro city cemetery almost a year after you’d last seen Miss Olga. From there under the cover of night, it didn’t take long for you to sense where she’d been buried.\n\nA simple grave, but not a pauper’s one. She still had the money to afford a proper burial. Probably made all the preparations in advance. You wonder if there was anyone actually at her funeral. Probably not. She didn’t have anyone other than the children at the orphanage and she always said she was just your caretaker, nothing more.\n\nYou don’t exactly believe that though. Surely she had more feelings than she let on, especially with her concern of you “being good” as one of her last words to you.\n\nYou could stand here and make yourself feel warm and fuzzy that Miss Olga had more feelings for you than she let on, but why bother?\n\nAny feelings other than the ones she expressed when she was alive are buried with her in that grave. She was a part of your childhood, and now she isn’t. And that’s that.\n\nStill, if you really felt so disconnected you wouldn’t be here in the first place.\n\nYou crouch down at the grave.\n\n“I know you tried. Thank you.” You say putting a hand on the gravestone.\n\nYou stand back up and to your surprise; you see a couple of grave wings gliding nearby before settling on the top of the gravestone. Been awhile since you’ve seen one in person.\n\nYou stare at the creatures for a moment thinking about how your path is definitely not heading in the direction of “being good” or at least it seems very unlikely. Even with all the new magic you’ve been studying, necromancy and the call to death are always there. You aren’t sure where that’s going to ultimately lead yet, but it probably won’t be something Miss Olga would approve of.\n\nFor a brief moment, you wonder in this graveyard…\n\n“No. Not yet.” You say to yourself, shaking your head.\n\nWith those last thoughts, you take your leave of Miss Olga’s grave and the cemetery.\n",
  "page 88": "You have no idea what’s going to happen tomorrow and if you’ll even have the opportunity to get away for long since Miss Olga will be awake and will probably go looking for you as soon as she’s unable to find you in the orphanage. At least she’ll be asleep right now.\n\nYou get out of bed and put on your shoes. Chloe stands in shock for a moment before realizing you’re serious about sneaking out.\n\n“Cat are you seriously going to do this?” Chloe asks.\n“Yes, keep your voice down! Now are you going to come with me or not?” you whisper.\n“No! And this is a really bad idea!”\n“Fine. I’ll go by myself then.”\n“Catalina you can’t…”\n\nYou’re already quickly creeping away while Chloe is still disbelieving you’re actually going to do this.\n\nYou manage to leave the sleeping area and into the hallway. You’re fairly certain nobody woke up since you still hear Patty snoring. You quickly make your way past Miss Olga’s bedroom, which is silent.\n\nThe bigger challenge is walking down the creaky stairs without waking up everyone. The only thing you can think of to do is to crawl-slide down the bannister to the bottom. It’s tricky, but you manage it and soon you’re on the ground floor where you quickly make your way to the front door. You unlock the door and slip outside.\n\nThe park isn’t too far away, and while you hear a few sounds of the night, the streets are empty. The only dim light is the moon above, as typical in this area someone hasn’t kept up on keeping the street lamps lit.\n\nYou get down the steps and then hear something behind you. You’re fully expecting it to be Miss Olga, but turn and to your relief you see Chloe.\n\n“I still don’t think this is a good idea.” She says as she approaches you.\n“We won’t be gone long. I’m sort of glad you’re here though, looks like the lamps aren’t lit and the moon isn’t that bright tonight. That night vision of yours might come in handy in case someone is lurking in the darkness.” You respond.\n\nYour words of someone potentially lurking in the darkness don’t comfort Chloe, but she comes with you anyway.\n\nYou and Chloe make your way to the park fairly quickly with no encounters. When you get to the park, it’s a lot darker as the excessive amount of trees block the moonlight, and nobody even bothered to light the walkway lamps here either.\n\nIt’s dark enough that you are having a slightly hard time remembering exactly where you saw the butterflies. Chloe manages to help in keeping you from tripping over rocks or falling into small holes in the ground made by small furry animals.\n\n“Are you sure this is the right direction?” Chloe asks.\n“Yeah, I’m…sure…there they are!” you suddenly exclaim midway speaking to Chloe.\n\nYou see a faint purple glow at the bush you must have seen them before. This isn’t a constant glow though, they’re fading in and out. Going from a deep purple and back again. Looks like they’re all on the bush sleeping perhaps.\n\nYou leave Chloe who maintains a bit of a distance from you, saying to be careful. You’re not paying attention to her though; you’re drawn to the glow.\n\nYou approach closer to the bush focused so much on the grave wings that you forget that they were swarmed over a cat corpse earlier which you trip over.\n\nFortunately the fall isn’t too bad since it’s partially broken by the bush itself, but you managed to disturb all the grave wings which flutter away.\n\n“Catalina! Are you alright?” you hear Chloe shout as you’re rolling back over.\n“Yeah, I think so, I just…” you start to say and then feel something on your leg.\n\nIt’s hard to see in the dark, so you try to bend your leg forward. You feel a sharp pain and give a yelp.\n\n“What’s going on!?” Chloe shouts.\n“I dunno, I think…I think I got something in my leg.”\n“Oh no!”\n“Hurts…hold on…”\n\nYou grope at your leg and pull whatever it is out. You do so causing yourself to grimace and stifle your cries of pain. You then shakily bring the object closer to your face so you can actually see it. Looks like a piece of bone. Maybe a rib from the cat? You don’t really know. You know you’re bleeding though.\n\nAt this point Chloe has overcome her reluctance and finally come over to you.\n\n“I knew this was a bad idea! Does it hurt?” she says.\n“Yeah…can you help me up? Gotta get back before…”\n\nYour attention is once again drawn away from the immediate situation and back to the grave wings, which have made their way back to the area. Chloe for whatever reason is really scared of them.\n\n“Argh! No!” Chloe screams and moves out of the way so they don’t land on her.\n\nThey don’t seem to be focused at all on her, so much as they are at you and several descend on to your bleeding leg, while another lands on your hand.\n\n“Pretty…” you say, not realizing that Chloe has run off.\n\nYou also don’t realize that the grave wings are currently feasting your open wound at first until you feel a lightheaded sensation.\n\nYou look once more at the grave wing on your hand, which seems to glow just a little brighter and then you lose consciousness.\n\nWhen you come to, you see Miss Olga standing over you. You’re not in your bed; you’re in a spare bed used for when someone is sick.\n\n“Thank the gods you’re awake, do you even know how much I was worried that you wouldn’t?” Miss Olga exclaims.\n\nYou don’t answer, since you’re still groggy.\n\n“You’re lucky Chloe was foolish enough to follow you on your nightly adventure, yet wise enough to run to get me. I told you that grave wings are filthy creatures! You’re also lucky I managed to clean out your wound before infection spread. We’re going to have to keep an eye on it though. Hopefully, we won’t need to take you to a proper doctor.”\n\nYou continue to say nothing, as there’s no point in interrupting Olga’s rant. You’ll just make her madder.\n\n“Now I’M going to get the rest prepared for adoption day. I had HOPED that you’d be out there since you obviously need more structure than I can possibly provide. But you’re in no condition right now so you’re missing this one. Do you have ANYTHING to say for yourself?”\n\nIf Miss Olga was expecting any sort of apology or introspectiveness on your actions last night, her hopes are dashed as you silently just shake your head.\n\nMiss Olga raises her hands up, rolls her eyes, gives an exasperated sigh and leaves. You hear the door being firmly locked afterwards, not that you were going anywhere, since you still feel a little strange.\n\nTime passes and you start feel a little better. You look at your leg, which is wrapped up, but it doesn’t hurt so much as it just aches.\n\nYou then hear the door unlock, you expect it to be Miss Olga, but it’s Chloe, with a small vase of flowers.\n\n“Catalina, I brought these for you.” She says, approaching your bed, looking a little downtrodden.\n“Oh. Put them on that table near the bed I guess.” You answer.\n\nAs Chloe does so you wonder why she’s here.\n\n“Why aren’t you out there standing around for adoption day?” you ask.\n“Oh, I was for awhile. But um, nobody was coming up to me at all, then Fatty Patty was taunting me about it and I just left. I don’t even think Miss Olga noticed I was gone.” Chloe says.\n“So did someone adopt her?”\n“No, she’s just stuffing her face with all the food laid out. I don’t think anyone is interested in her either, but doesn’t stop her from being mean. Anyway I ended up going to the park and decided to pick some flowers for you.”\n“You went back to the park? Did you see the grave wings?”\n“No! I didn’t even go anywhere near where we went last night. That was scary and I was afraid you died!”\n\nChloe grabs your hand after she says this. You never really noticed how much Chloe values your indifference towards her as “friendship.”\n\nYou suppose it probably is a good thing she was looking out for you.\n\n“It’s fine Chloe, and thanks for getting help.” You say.\n“So did you need anything else? Some food? I don’t think Fatty Patty has eaten it all yet.” Chloe asks.\n“No, in fact you probably should leave. Last thing either of us needs is for Miss Olga to come in and start yelling at both of us.”\n“Yeah, maybe that is a good idea. Okay, you get better.”\n\nChloe smiles and leaves. You lie in bed thinking about what compelled you to go see those butterflies so badly. You don’t really know. It couldn’t have just because you thought they were pretty. The flowers that Chloe just brought in are pretty and you don’t feel as strongly about them.\n\nYou’ve also been wondering about some of the weird stuff you were seeing while you were sleeping. You don’t really remember most of it, but there were images of skulls mixed in the butterflies, cat’s corpse, the Nuro graveyard, which you remember seeing once when you wandered off and got lost in the city. (You probably would visit there more than the park if it wasn’t so far) and just weird dark shapes in general.\n\nAnd while some of this is a bit scary to you, most of it is just intriguing.\n\nTired of being stuck in bed, you sit up and try to walk around. You use the nearby table to prop yourself up, but when you finally stand on your leg, it’s a little weaker than you thought and you stumble, causing the vase to fall and break.\n\n“Damn!” you swear. You know you’re not supposed to swear, but it just seemed appropriate in this situation especially since you know Miss Olga is going to come in and complain about the mess you’ve made.\n\nWith some effort you start picking up shards of the vase and putting in a drawer. When you touch one of the flowers though something interesting happens.\n\nIt slowly wilts in your hand, causing you to drop it immediately.\n\nHesitantly, you pick up a different flower and the same thing happens. It wilts to the point where the petals actually blacken and fall off. You pick up yet another flower, but nothing happens which confuses you.\n\nYou set aside the unchanged flower along with the newly dead one and go back to the wilted one that you dropped.\n\nIt remains the same at first, but then something odd happens, it shows a bit of life again. Still wilted though.\n\n“Cool...”\n",
  "page 87": "It’s all a haze. You see yourself as a child, but it’s hard to tell when exactly. You’re maybe five or six right now? It’s the earliest you can ever remember, any younger as it’s just a mystery. But as with anything that happened in your past life, does it really matter any more?\n\nYou do remember growing up in an orphanage. You never knew your real parents. At best maybe your birth mother knew she couldn’t take care of you and tearfully left you in the hopes that some other family would.\n\nAt worst, well you wouldn’t be the first unwanted child and better that you were at least placed in a half way decent orphanage than just sold on the black market or something.\n\nMiss Olga’s Home for Lost Children.\n\nLost is sort of a nice way to put unwanted. Makes it sound like you just took a wrong turn and wound up there just waiting for your parents to come pick you up.\n\nThough that isn’t too far off from what an orphanage does. You wait around for someone declaring themselves as your parents to pick you up.\n\nWell that’s what happens to some children anyway. Others never do for whatever reason and just eventually age out of the system and get thrown out on the streets.\n\nOf course at this age you weren’t really thinking about any of that. In fact you snuck away from the orphanage as much as possible. Usually to the nearby park.\n\nNuro’s park was pretty nice one. The city really took care of its major green area. So much so that there were signs that clearly warned people to NOT step off certain paths.\n\nWhile there was no real dangerous animals or flowers there, just more of a case of Nuro’s council not wanting the beauty of the park trashed. Of course this didn’t stop people from straying off the designated areas, usually young folks nipping off to copulate in the bushes or something similar.\n\nOf course your reasons were more due to being drawn to observing animals and insects.\n\nYou watch a couple of squirrels frolicking for a time and eventually finding a morsel of food, the pair of them run off into one of those off limit areas. Making sure nobody is looking or in the area, you quickly sneak off to follow.\n\nEventually the squirrels climb up a tall tree and you lose sight of them, but your attention is drawn to something else. A large amount of purple butterflies fluttering about a bush.\n\nYou’ve never seen butterflies like that before. Their coloring is very beautiful. You decide to get closer.\n\nWhen you do, that’s when you notice something at the bottom of the bushes. It’s furry and not moving. You see the butterflies fluttering all over it.\n\nEven at this young age, you understand the concept of death, but you’ve not seen many direct examples of it. Granted you’ve seen dead animals before, but this is different. Mainly because this one is covered in these weird purple butterflies rather than the traditional ones.\n\nYou take a step closer and see that the animal isn’t a squirrel like you at first thought, but a cat. The butterflies are swarming around the body. You wonder if they’re eating it.\n\nJust as you’re about to inspect even closer, you suddenly feel a hand grab your shoulder.\n\n“There you are just as I suspected! You are always sneaking away to this place after I specifically told you not to! I know this place may be filled with animals and such, but it isn’t safe. Anyone could just snatch up a young thing like you. Especially with the demonic types living in this city.”\n\nYou look up and see Miss Olga. The older lady who runs the orphanage hence why it’s named after her.\n\nShe gives you a disapproving look. The same one she has many times before, but you know she’s not completely mad at you. She just worries about you as she does with all that live in the orphanage.\n\n“I wanted to be here.” You answer.\n“Yes, I know you always do, but you can’t keep sneaking away like this, especially at this late hour! I have so many others to look after and worry about. When I’m looking for you, I can’t watch out for the others as easily. It’s not fair to them that...”\n\nAt this point you’re too focused on the butterflies to completely pay attention to Miss Olga. She recognizes this and finally looks at what’s got your attention.\n\nHer reaction isn’t one of wonder though; it’s of minor concern.\n\n“What the…Grave Wings? Here? Usually they’re only found in more remote areas of wilderness like the Drozz plains. They’re not your normal butterflies. They’re more like regular flies except they’re specifically drawn to death. Doesn’t make sense that some are here though. Bah, probably some escaped from an alchemist’s lab from the magic college. They’re never mindful of their experiments, it’s going to be the ruin of us all one day!”\n\nAs Olga is going on about the magic college, one of the butterflies flaps away from the corpse and towards your direction. You smile and hold a hand out towards it. You think it’s going to land, but then Olga once again pulls you away.\n\n“Catalina! Don’t touch those vile things!”\n“But they’re pretty.”\n“They’re carrion eaters! They’re filthy and probably crawling with disease! And the city council needs to exterminate them from the park before they breed anymore.”\n“Hey they’re glowing!” you shout, still focused on the butterflies.\n“Yes, they do that when it starts getting dark. Now come on!”\n\nAs you’re pulled away from the Grave Wing gathering, you continue to be fascinated by their fluttering and faint glowing.\n\nEventually you get back to the orphanage where upon Olga tells you that food will be prepared in a few minutes and she expects you to be there as well as going straight to bed soon afterwards.\n\nAs Olga walks away, Chloe, a little half orc girl about your age approaches you. She’s not very popular with the other children most likely because of her heritage. She tends to hang out with you probably because you don’t care what she is, but then you don’t care about a lot of things most would.\n\n“Catalina, did Miss Olga yell at you?” Chloe asks.\n“Yeah, a little.” You answer.\n“Well I didn’t tell her where you were, but Patty said you were at the park.”\n“Of course she did because she’s a big fat tattle tale. Doesn’t matter, Miss Olga always knows where I sneak off to now.”\n“So why do you keep doing it?”\n“Because I like the park better. There are all sorts of interesting things there. Like today I saw these purple butterflies! Never seen anything like them before. Miss Olga called them Grave Wings.”\n“Grave Wings? They sound scary.”\n“No! They were pretty and they were eating a dead cat!”\n“That sounds awful! Poor kitty!”\n“I’m going to go see them tomorrow!”\n“Tomorrow? You can’t sneak off tomorrow. Tomorrow is adoption day! People will come here to adopt us! Well you they will, nobody will want me.”\n“I’m sure you’ll get adopted, but I don’t care about it, so I’m going to go see the butterflies.”\n“If you sneak off tomorrow, Miss Olga is going to be furious! You’ll be on permanent cleaning punishment for months!”\n“Hmm, well I don’t like cleaning…maybe I can sneak out tonight after bedtime.”\n“Sneak out at night!? That’s crazy!”\n“I won’t be gone long, the park isn’t far and I know where I’ll be going.”\n\nChloe sputters a bit, trying to find the words to talk you out of your plan and then you both hear Miss Olga call everyone to dinner at which point you head towards the dining room.\n\nAfter eating, Miss Olga mentions to everyone that people will be arriving tomorrow afternoon and she expects everyone to be dressed in their good clothes and on their best behavior. In fact instead of allowing you all to still play after dinner, you’re ordered to go straight to bed.\n\nYou go to bed as ordered, but not to sleep. You aren’t the only one as you can hear the whispering of some of the other girls talking to each other. Meanwhile you’re deep in thought about how much you’re not looking forward to tomorrow.\n\nYou don’t like the idea of being lined up for a bunch of strangers to inspect you. Something about it seems weird to you. And if you get picked, who knows where you’ll be going? The people who adopt you might not even live in Nuro and you won’t get to go to the park anymore. Worse, they could be mean or even demons in disguise!\n\nAs much as you don’t care for the orphanage, at least the park is nearby and Miss Olga isn’t cruel.\n\nA bit more time passes and suddenly you hear Chloe whisper to you. She must have gotten out of her bed.\n\n“Hey, you’re not still thinking about sneaking out are you?” Chloe asks.\n“I was going to wait until at least Fatty Patty was asleep, which I’m guessing she is due to all the snoring.” You say.\n“But…but it’ll be dark, how will you see them? And how do you know they haven’t just flapped away already?”\n“I dunno, I feel like they will still be there. As for light, they glow! So I’ll be able to see them.”\n“Okay, but you still have to get to the park and it’ll still be too dark to see really well and dangerous!”\n“It’ll be fine…wait, orcs can see in the dark right?”\n“Um, yeah?”\n“Then come with me so I won’t be alone and you’ll be able to guide better.”\n\nChloe nearly raises her voice but then stops herself so as not to wake anyone up.\n\n“No, it’ll be too scary!”\n“The dark is nothing to be afraid of. I thought orcs weren’t afraid of anything.”\n“I’m only half! And this doesn’t sound like a good idea.”\n\nChloe’s apprehension aside, she’d probably still help you out, though you’d go without her even if she didn’t.\n\nOf course there is a part of you that isn’t completely reckless. If you really thought about it, sneaking about at night might be a little dangerous (and a little scary). You probably could still just as easily sneak away in the morning before all the people show up for the unpleasant adoption process.\n",
  "page 119": "Probably a bad idea following the advice of a demon, but you’re tired and if you’re being honest, you’re a little curious about the library now after hearing the story.\n\nYou make your way to the east side of the campus and Big Red wasn’t lying, even in the dark, you can see it looming in the distance. In fact it sort of sits away from the rest of the buildings.\n\nThe closer you get, the grass becomes a bit more overgrown and wild. All of the vegetation is like that. You sort of wonder why since you have to think it would be a simple matter to keep it looking neat with some spells. This is a magic college after all. Maybe Big Red is correct in that it is just a simple case of laziness.\n\nCautiously you approach the library only to find most of the steps leading up are half broken and uneven. The front door also has giant chain with a lock on it. Not a big deal since you just gesture your hands and focus a bit until you hear a click. You see the chain fall and enter. Not really the best security for a magic school if they wanted to keep people out, but again maybe it really is just laziness and apathy.\n\nThe moonlight shining in from the broken windows provides a bit of light, but not much. You definitely do have to watch your step as the wooden floor you’re walking on creaks and isn’t very strong in some places as you quickly remove your foot when it feels like it’s going fall through. Outright holes to what you assume is to a lower level of the library are also present.\n\nYou see a couple of stairways to upper levels, but in one case, nearly nothing is left of the steps themselves. You’re not really in the mood to explore right now though, especially in the dark, so the ground floor it is.\n\nYou make your way past several bookcases, most of which are predictably empty. So far other than it being in great disrepair, there’s nothing magical about the library. Of course that doesn’t mean there isn’t danger since you do hear noises occasionally which sound like the predictable squeaking and scurrying of multiple of rats\n\nEventually you find what was probably a staff room. Some dusty furniture is still around and a serviceable couch is available for you to flop down on.\n\nAnd it’s just enough weight to cause the weak wooden floor to completely give way causing you take a trip downward until you hit the bottom of the basement.\n\nFortunately you’re more or less unhurt thanks to the sturdy couch and its remarkably intact cushions. Unfortunately, you’re now in complete darkness and the sounds of those rats are a lot closer.\n\nYou never really got the hang of casting “light” since the last thing you wanted to do is potentially attract Miss Olga’s attention when you were practicing magic at night in your room. Not to mention you never seemed to be able to make a bright light, the best you could ever do was emulate the dark purple glow of a Gravewing, so that’s what you do.\n\nA ball of purple light illuminates a small part of the darkness and besides debris, you only see a lot of metal cabinets. Or you assume there’s a lot of them, sort of hard to tell when you can only see the immediate area around you.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is find a way back up and out of here because you’re already hearing chittering noises getting closer. You spin around and see small figures scurry nearby.\n\nUnlike the weak wood of the ground floor, the basement floor is solid stone, so you waste no time in quickly getting out of this area and looking for a way back up. Of course since you still can’t see very well and there’s debris all over, you’re still tripping every other step until you finally just fall into a pile of bones. A lot of bones.\n\nIn fact, upon picking yourself up and getting a better look, these bones aren’t even of animals. Some of them are clearly humanoid. You look around some more and see a large hole in the wall and it’s large enough for something bigger than rats to come in and out of.\n\nThen you feel a blow to the back your head causing you to stagger and then collapse once again.\n\nYou’re not sure how much time passes, but when you come to a large cooking fire provides the lighting with a sizable pot hanging over it nearby. You can’t tell where you are exactly, but you know that you’re in a cage and not in the library anymore, looks like you’re still underground though.\n\nYou also see hunched figures standing near the cooking fire. You can’t quite make out what they are, but they’re not human based on their rodent like appearance.\n\n“Skeez, we don’t need no more rat in da pot! Dat’s the whole point of havin da girl!” one of them says.\n“Thought she was for breedin’, purposes.” Skeez says.\n“Gaw said she’s fer eatin, not breedin!”\n“Gaw ALWAYS says that, I think Gaw doesn’t like girls. Probably ruttin wit Qeesh right now.”\n“Shhhh! Don’t let him hear you say dat! He’ll eat YOU!”\n“Pfft, not scared of ‘im! Anyways, the clan has lasted fer a long time, hell we even survived most of the Dead War nonsense on the surface, but it ain’t gonna last too much longer if we don’t start makin more babies. I don’t get why we don’t just grab some dumb ass college girls.”\n“Cuz we ain’t supposed to attract attention. Rich college kids missing might cause some to go looking.”\n“Well fine, we could always use the tunnels to grab some whores down in the poor section of Nuro, nobody’s gonna miss them. It’s weird, Gaw is all for nabbing people off the street to put in da pot, but when it comes to actually thinking about the future of the clan, he does nothing. There’s only what, six of us left now? In the past our clan used to be much larger!”\n“Yeah but den there’s wuz all dat in fighting and even dat purge that tried to wipe us all out. Gaw says we can’t risk dat ever happening again.”\n“There won’t be nuthin left ta risk if we don’t replenish our numbers soon. We’re not getting any younger either.”\n“Hrm, maybe you right. But dis one still for da pot. She look too young for breedin anyway.”\n“From what I saw of her, she’s barely fer eatin’ given how skinny she is. I don’t even like humie meat. Rats taste betta. Even one of doze greenskins would be betta.”\n“You gots weird tastes, Skeez.”\n\nWhile you were busy eaves dropping, you didn’t notice a third rat thing sitting quietly in the shadows.\n\n“Hey, you two might wanna shut up, becuz the meat’s awake an listening to everything you’re fucking saying.”\n\nAt this point the other two look over at you as the third one steps out into the firelight.\n\n“Well so she is. Good, better to kill her while she kickin’. Fear make the meat taste better.\n\nAs the three rat men approach, you back up and prepare to cast your tried and true attack spell.\n\nOnly for Skeez to start chuckling and make a wave with his own hand, forming a brief blue barrier over himself and his fellows. A protective magic shell of some kind.\n\n“What girlie? Youz think we don’t know you don’t have magic or know it? The clan hasn’t been living near the fucking university for so long in secret without knowin da arts! An while I can sense youz a little more talented fer a humie yer age, you ain’t no match…hmmm. Mebbe you SHOULD be breedin stock.” Skeez says.\n“Skeez, we been over dis.” The one that was arguing with him says.\n“YOU been over dis Krech! I said I ain’t scared of Gaw and we NEED more babies to make the clan live again! This magic girl is young and could probably survive several birthins an her magical blood would only enhance da young! Me and Gaw are the only two with any sort of abilities left an’ he’d rather just smash someone in da head. No, I’m sayin, we keep her for breeding stock and I’m gonna have da first crack at her.”\n\nWhile the three rat things start arguing about what unsavory action they exactly want to do with you, you once again reminded of what happened earlier with the thugs that tried to assault you in the alley. It was different there. There would have been witnesses and it was out in the open.\n\nHere? There are no witnesses, and nobody is going to miss these parasites of civilization. You look around and see all the bones nearby, there’s more than enough here and a magic barrier isn’t going to protect them from what you have in mind…\n\n“LOOK, WEES GONNA EAT ‘ER AN DATS IT! Dats whut Gaw said!” Krech shouts.\n“Dats whut Gaw said. You hear yerself? You takin it in the rump too or you just so far up his, dat you not think fer yerself anymore?” Skeez asks.\n“Again, would you two shut the…”\n\nSuddenly a large rat thing enters with a couple of smaller ones.\n\n“What the hell is all dis noise? I’m tryin ta sleep an you lot are squeeking loud enough to wake the fucking dead!”\n\nA very accurate choice of last words.\n\nBefore any of the rat things can answer their fearless leader, Skeez is impaled by the sharp bones of the half skeletons you’ve managed to raise.\n\nYou go into a complete trance raising every single half eaten corpse you can in the lair. It isn’t much and it’s causing you a great deal of energy, but it’s enough to cause the ratmen to panic and lose their shit before putting up any sort of proper resistance.\n\n“Bitch! Youz doin’ dis!” Gaw shouts and smashes aside one of the boney attackers. Gaw does his best to rush at your cage, he even manages to rip the door open, but the big rat man eventually falls to the onslaught his former dinner choices.\n\nThe dead however are proving somewhat difficult for you to control directly. You hold them back from attacking you and then completely release your power of their animation, giving you a bit of you energy back. You were tired before, now you’re exhausted and your short “nap” from getting knocked out didn’t help.\n\nYou stagger out of the cage nearly ready to collapse, but you don’t because you still hear something.\n\nYou go over to the cooking fire which is still burning brightly and heating pot, the bodies of the rat men lie on the floor, but only one is still barely alive. It’s Skeez and he’s coughing up blood along with bleeding from several vital areas of his body. He’s not long for this world. You pick up a nearby broken leg bone. The rat weakly raises a hand and attempts to speak in between the wheezing.\n\nYou aren’t interested in his words, especially after what he had in store. You bring the leg bone down on his head until his head is split open and his brains are leaking out his ears.\n\nWhen it’s done, you toss the bone aside and stagger down one of the tunnels, managing to muster up a bit of purple light like you did last time. Fortunately the tunnel you picked leads back to the library basement.\n\nEventually you make your way back to where the couch fell and lay down on it to sleep, like you originally wanted to. You turn out the light and if any rats of any kind have any notions of eating you (or anything else) you can’t be bothered to do anything about it because you’re out of it.\n\nFortunately when you wake up, you’re in one piece and none the worse for wear. Or at least not in any worse condition than you were before.\n\nSome light shines down from the hole above, so it must at least be daytime now and you’re reminded that you still need to get back up the ground floor, though that should be easier now at least.\n\nYou still feel a little woozy, but you feel better in general. It’s like you finally reawakened something that needed to be unleashed, if only on a minor scale.\n\nYou realize now, that you need to pursue this branch of magic regardless of where it leads you. You aren’t even sure how you’re going to control it better or grow in power, but surely you will learn more about magic here in what is considered to be the greatest magical learning center of the world.\n\nYou don’t even have a plan for the future, but you feel very strongly that it all starts here for you.\n\nThis will be your home until you figure it all out.\n",
  "page 89": "You think on it, the danger of the city at night, Chloe’s words, potential trouble with Miss Olga…yeah it’s probably not worth it.\n\n“Yeah, maybe you’re right Chloe. I’ll wait until tomorrow morning at least.” You say.\n“I still think that’s a bad idea, but I guess it’s better than going at night.” Chloe says.\n\nSeeing that you’re not sneaking out, Chloe returns to her bed and you roll over to try to sleep.\n\nExcept you can’t sleep. You’re too wound up from having the idea of sneaking out and then not acting on it. Not to mention Fatty Patty’s snoring is keeping you from even trying to sleep.\n\nYou close your eyes and try to sleep, but it just isn’t working. All that keeps going through your mind is seeing the butterflies again.\n\nWith Patty’s snoring going on and your active mindset, you can’t lay in bed all night. You MUST go to the park now; it’s worth risking the consequences.\n\nYou figure you’ll wait a little while longer until you’re sure Chloe is probably asleep and THEN you’ll leave. You don’t want her trying to stop you again.\n\nYou aren’t sure how much time passes, but eventually you look up to see if everyone is actually asleep now and feeling confident that they are, you get up and sneak out the room.\n\nYou head towards the stairway and then on reflex, you let out a big yawn as now of all times the wave of sleep hits you. Worried that you might have awakened Miss Olga, you quicken your pace and head down the stairs.\n\nWhich unfortunately results in you tripping down them, not enough to break anything, since you manage to catch yourself from tumbling completely, but certainly enough to be unpleasant. Surprisingly you don’t cry, but you definitely hurt.\n\nThis also has the effect of most certainly waking up Miss Olga.\n\n“What’s going on? What’s all this sneaking around?” you hear Miss Olga say before seeing you laying sprawled out near the bottom of the stairs. Then she quickly descends to get you to see if you’re all right.\n\nAfter seeing that you haven’t broken anything, she begins scolding and questioning you. About the only thing you can think of is that you were going to the bathroom and thought you heard a noise downstairs. Fortunately she doesn’t dwell on it too much and just carries you back to bed exclaiming how you should have come to her immediately if you heard a strange noise in the night.\n\nThe some of the children temporarily wake up when you’re returned to bed (save for Patty who is still snoring) Chloe asks what happened and if you’re okay, Miss Olga just tells her you’re fine and to go back to sleep. She tells everyone to go back to sleep.\n\nMeanwhile, you ache and you’re tired enough now that you don’t want to go anywhere except lay in bed. You’ll sleep and tomorrow morning you’ll go to the park. That’s the new plan. You just need some sleep.\n\nEventually…\n\n“Catalina! Catalina! Wake up! Wake up!” you hear Chloe say.\n\nYou groggily wake up.\n\n“What’s going on?” you ask.\n“You feeling okay? Miss Olga said you fell down the stairs last night.”\n“Huh? Oh. Yeah I did.”\n“I’m guessing you tried to sneak out anyway, but I didn’t tell! Are you feeling okay though?”\n“Yeah, yeah, just ache still, but I’m fine. What time is it?”\n“It’s like close to noon. A bunch of adults are coming in to adopt already.”\n\nYou begin to stir a little more and realize you’ve overslept.\n\n“What?! Noon? Why wasn’t I awakened before now?”\n“Miss Olga said you’d probably need the rest more and you don’t eat much breakfast anyway. I think Patty ate yours. Anyway Miss Olga told me to try to wake you up for adoption though since she’s busy greeting everyone.”\n\nWell there goes your idea to sneak away. The grave wings might very well be gone by now.\n\nYou suppose there’s nothing for it now except go downstairs, maybe there will be an opportunity to sneak away later.\n\nChloe mentions that you should wear your best clothes for the best opportunity to get adopted. Not that you’re really running around in rags anyway, but you’re not really concerned with getting adopted, so you just wear clothes you normally wear.\n\nEventually you go downstairs and see a bunch of adults and your fellow orphans. Miss Olga sees you and walks over to you immediately.\n\n“Catalina are you feeling alright?” Miss Olga asks.\n“Somewhat, I still ache a bit.” You respond.\n“Hm, well at least you’re walking around. Here, I want you to meet two people, I think you’ll like them. Come.”\n\nMiss Olga pulls you away from Chloe and towards a group of adults, two of them in particular stand out, but it’s odd. You can’t make out their faces and you’re clearly close enough to them. In fact everything is starting to seem off.\n\nSomething isn’t right here.\n",
  "page 82": "Whatever is going to await you on the new world, it probably would be better if you had some back up, even if they tend to fail you most of the time.\n\n“Yes, I’ll assemble the remainder of the population of this fortress immediately.” You say.\n\nBig Red looks a little surprised, but he tells you to take the time you need as a deal’s a deal.\n\nYou immediately find your nearest minion and tell him to start alerting the rest of the fortress as everyone is to report to the summoning chamber now. You take the time to do this with a few others you find as well. You also tell them to tell everyone to grab what they want and hurry up because you’re leaving immediately.\n\nYou eventually return to the summoning chamber where Big Red has opened a glowing dark red portal.\n\n“Ready to go when you are, how many are there anyway?” Big Red asks.\n“I think the count was one hundred and six, including myself.” You reply.\n“I see, and do you think that’s enough to replenish your race?”\n“I dunno. I would imagine so; we still have slightly more females than males I believe.”\n“Surpising given what you were doing with that half of your population with the Dero.”\n“Yeah, well the idiot males still tend to get themselves killed a lot more hence why there’s less of them. As for the females, I won’t be doing my part of the breeding process, I already did my part for motherhood by saving all their asses in the first place.”\n“Ah yes, you really did make the ultimate sacrifice for all of them didn’t you?”\n“Yes, and they better realize once and for all how lucky they have me to lead them.”\n“I’m sure they will, anyway are you ready to enter or are you going to wait for the others?”\n\nYou pause.\n\n“You seem eager for me to enter.” You say.\n“Well this is the only way to leave the world.” Big Red says.\n“I know that, but for all I know you’ve got a horde of demons on the other side waiting to rip me apart or I step into a lake of fire or something.”\n“My you have quite the imagination. No, as I said, the deal is the deal, no matter how unfavorable it may be to me. If I was to break this contract by killing you, having my fellows kill you or even a portal accident, trust me, the repercussions would affect me much more negatively than they would affect you.”\n“I doubt that, however I suppose that even a prized soul like mine isn’t worth breaking a contract over. Fine, I’ll go in now.”\n“Very good, I’ll be along shortly, along with the rest of your people. I highly suggest though that you don’t stray too far away from where you appear on the other side. It’ll be safe in that area only, and I wouldn’t want to be responsible for any random mindless infernals that may be lurking nearby.”\n“Your concern is touching.”\n\nWith those words, you enter the portal….\n\nYou find yourself in a hostile looking wasteland with a red sky. It’s unbearably hot as well. In the distance your can see figures flying about and large black fortresses amongst the rocky landscape.\n\nStrange noises of all sorts come from various directions and you feel very vulnerable. It’s not a big improvement from where you just came from.\n\nAt first you think Big Red has broken the deal, but he eventually pops in near you along with several svelk.\n\n“See? Told you, I’d be back. The rest of your people are still coming through the other portal, so more should be popping in. Might take awhile which is just as well since it’ll take time for me to open up the one to the world you lot are going to.”\n“Oh, and why is that?” you ask.\n“Contrary to popular belief, it’s not that common to open up portals from THIS side to other worlds like yours. Takes a lot of power and the only reason why I’m even able to rip open a portal to this one, is because the barriers there between this realm and it are a little weak right now, thanks to multiple succubus incursions there. In any case, I’d rather not be bothered while I do this, I’ll need to focus. Go talk to your people or something.” Big Red says and begins his task to open a portal to the new world.\n\nWhile you’re a little annoyed by Big Red’s dismissal you’d rather he focus so you can get out of here as quick as possible. Now it’s just waiting around. Big Red said to go speak with your people in the meantime, which probably would be best, since you’re going to make plans for the new world.\n\nYou call over to the large group of svelk and tell them to come over to you. Other svelk start popping in as the crowd gathers around you.\n\nHonestly, you’ve never really liked bothering with long-winded speeches to an audience, but you’ve got to waste time somehow, so you begin by mentioning the past achievements of the old Svelk Empire.\n\nBy the time you’ve got at least a group of seventy or so svelk around you, you’ve moved on to how this new world you’ll all be going to will be fertile ground for a new Empire. A fresh start to a glorious new beginning and how whoever stands in your way on this world will soon learn to fear you.\n\nThe crowd is fairly quiet. Most of them have heard you say similar things before a long time ago when you first reunited them on Dokkrus and obviously that didn’t go well. Still, you get a few positive responses, however as you’re speaking you notice there is a group that hasn’t even moved since you called them over.\n\nYou look back over at Big Red who is still in the process of opening the portal, so since you still have time…\n\n“Hey! You lot over there! I summoned you over!” you shout.\n\nNone in the group even respond. From this distance, it looks like the group is mostly comprised of females. Typical.\n\n“HEY! That’s two! It would be in your best interest to obey and come over here NOW!”\n\nOne of the women turns her head and then gives you a dirty look before turning her back. You then see them laughing.\n\n“Glad you find this amusing because that’s three.” You say.\n“Glad to know you can count better than you can lead.” You hear a voice say.\n\nThis is followed with more laughing by the insubordinate group. You think you even see a few smiles and chuckles by the group around you. This needs to be handled immediately.\n\nYou push your way through the crowd over to the group of impudent females who have now all turned to face you. Predictably more than a few are starting to look a little more concerned that they’ve earned your ire, though the biggest loudmouth still stands defiantly before you.\n\nYou don’t even say anything; you just strike her down immediately with a giant magical fist with one motion of your hand. The crowd backs away as their leader falls to the ground.\n\nShe isn’t dead, though half of her head is smashed in. It’s enough for her to dribble out the words “Ki…kill th…” which is enough for you to instinctively anticipate the next attacks from two more assailants.\n\nWhile you’re dispatching them, you hear someone shout.\n\n“We’re not letting you lead us in a new world! You fucked everything up on the old one and sold most of us to the dero as sex slaves!”\n“Pity I didn’t sell ALL of you.” You say and launch a lightning bolt at the person who said it and then another at a couple more in the group which has now been mostly dispatched other than a couple hiding behind large boulders.\n\nYou suddenly feel a rock hit the back of your head causing you to stumble forward a bit. You manage to stop yourself from falling over, but you’re a little dizzy.\n\nYou turn to see now the crowd that was listening to you, has also turned against you. You don’t know what’s got into these fools that NOW they’ve decided to stage a full revolt, but this isn’t good for you.\n\n“SHE CAN’T KILL ALL OF US! GET HER NOW!”\n\nWhoever said that, is unfortunately quite correct as you are further pelted by rocks by a large advancing crowd. It’s enough to bring you to the ground.\n\n“Fools! You…ack…need me to sur…vive!” you utter as you attempt to cast a protective spell but the crowd has now surrounded you and you can’t do anything except attempt to crawl away.\n\nYou don’t get far before you’re dragged back, stomped on, kicked and stoned repeatedly. Eventually someone shoves a dagger in your back, which pretty much sums up the entire svelk race.\n\nYour last thoughts before you fall unconscious, are wondering if Big Red somehow helped instigate this as some sort of last “loophole” or if you actually did bring this all on yourself and this was just a nice coincidence for him.\n\nIn any case, you begin laughing as you cough up blood, thinking of how with you dead, the contract will be void and Big Red will most likely have the rest of the svelk killed and collect their souls.\n\nBut he didn’t get yours.\n\nHowever when it falls into the hands of another demon lord, you wonder if it wouldn’t have been better if it had.\n\nAnd you have all eternity to think on that as you suffer far worse than your mortal death.\n",
  "page 81": "TR 12\n\nYou look out the window and see the land barely clinging to life. You think there might be a patch of grass that’s still green and a small tree in your immediate area, but that’s about it. It’s a good thing you’ll be getting out of here soon. Reports of some robed wraith like figure have recently been sighted on the continent. The being just kills anything living that’s near it. It doesn’t even have to do anything.\n\nYou can only guess it‘s the same being that killed Francis based on what Belina told you last year. Seems like a lifetime ago though.\n\nHonestly it probably was a good thing you stopped sacrificing svelk and trapping their souls when you did since it seemed to slow down the undead incursions at least in the short term. Maybe you were indirectly pissing off the Death God trapping souls like you were.\n\nAs you move away from the window, you hold your baby close to you, which is grabbing at your tits to suck on. Just like his father in that way.\n\nLooking at him and you’d never know he wasn’t a filthy mongrel at this point. Marzost wasn’t lying when the dero were getting concerned about svelk characteristics not going away. Good thing too, since Gikil was completely convinced it was his.\n\nStill, you imagine if this one were allowed to “grow” he’d wind up looking more like a dero and what an awful fate that would be. You’ll actually be doing a favor by killing him. Gikil was mildly concerned you didn’t murder the child immediately and actually feared you might get attached to it. The fool doesn’t know anything about you. One must savor these sorts of things.\n\n“Don’t worry little one, mommy will make your death quick. And your death will be helpful mommy too, which already makes you more useful than my pathetic daughter ever was. I suppose you deserve one last meal though. Drink deeply you little miserable half breed.” You say clutching the child and allowing him to feed.\n\nAs the baby drinks his last, you grab your dagger from your bed table. When he seems to be finished his eyes are closed looking completely content. If he hasn’t gone to sleep immediately, he’s well on his way.\n\n“Oh you males. You get what you want, and then fall right to sleep don’t you?” you say bringing the dagger up closer to the child.\n\nBefore you strike, you’d be lying if things were different, there’s a part of you that would be curious to actually try to raise this thing. Then you shake your head smiling.\n\n“No, he wouldn’t even exist in any other situation and even if he did, he’d just grow up to be another disappointment, like all children I raise. Goodbye son.” You whisper and slash open the baby’s throat. It makes nothing but a gurgling noise and just bleeds out like a stuck pig.\n\nYou quickly gather the blood (which is now all over the top part of you) in a nearby bottle that was also on your bed table.\n\nYou fill it up and then wrap up the baby’s bloody body in more blankets. You then call Gikil who comes in soon after.\n\n“Is it done?” Gikil asks.\n“No, I obviously have been teaching the baby to paint with the color red, of course it’s fucking done you idiot! Here, take this body and dispose of it.” You say attempting to hand off the corpse wrapped in bloody blankets.\n\nGikil takes it reluctantly and then quickly rushes out the door to call for some lackey to do it for him. Typical. When he was worrying about you not going through with it, you notice he was actually too weak to suggest that HE do it himself. This is why you always have to do everything yourself.\n\nYou immediately go to the table where Big Red’s contract still lays. You look it over again and see it’s changed slightly from the first time you looked over it last year. Typical infernal contract, always with the loopholes. Big Red probably didn’t think you could read infernal and granted you don’t understand all the words which under normal circumstances would be enough to doom you. However, you’ve got a loophole of your own.\n\nYou take a quill, dip it in your baby’s blood and write your signature. No sign of Big Red yet, but you imagine it won’t be long. Meanwhile Gikil re-enters the room.\n\n“Did you sign it?” he asks.\n“You’re just full of obvious idiotic questions today aren’t you? Yes, I fucking signed it. Now all we’re waiting for is this red asshole to show up.” You respond\n\nGikil nods and you see him flash a small smile. As much as you lowered yourself to fuck a dero, you think sharing your bed with this fool repeatedly was more degrading. Thankfully that will be over soon.\n\nBig Red suddenly appears.\n\n“Ah, so you have made your decision. Good thing too, I can already tell this world is nearly at its end. Or at least this continent. In any case, I trust you have the hundred souls?” Big Red says.\n“A few more than a hundred actually, but I imagine you already KNEW I wasn’t going to make a thousand in time.” You say.\n“Well I wouldn’t be good at my job if I couldn’t judge these things. I do thank you for the extra souls though.”\n“Big Red, the souls are in the chests over there.” Gikil says pointing to a couple of them against the wall.\n“Excellent, I’ll just take a look and we’ll soon be on our way.”\n\nBig Red goes over to the chests and opens them. Gikil is hovering around him quite a bit.\n\n“You see, it’s all there. And everything was done just like you said.” Gikil says.\n“Well the souls are here, but I still need to look over the contract just as a formality. I have to say Semra, I’m looking very forward to all the time we’re going to soon be spending together.” Big Red says going over to the table.\n“What about me? You…”\n“Yes, yes, I haven’t forgotten our deal. Your worthless life and your soul will be spared and you’ll get to go through the portal.”\n\nGikil smiles and even laughs a little.\n\n“So…you made a deal with Big Red?” you ask.\n“YES! And I just bent you over and fucked you in the ass good and hard!” Gikil laughs.\n\nYou stare at Gikil while he launches into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. Eventually he manages to stop himself long enough to speak again.\n\n“Big Red said that you’d most likely never sign away your soul willingly and would die attempting to gather a thousand souls unless there was a loop hole you thought you could exploit. So he proposed the baby idea to me to propose to you.” Gikil remarks.\n“Makes sense. I knew you couldn’t have come up with that one yourself.” You reply.\n“Make your snide quips about my intelligence if you want, but I’M not the one who is going to be in hell sucking demon cock for eternity!”\n“That remains to be seen. So I’m guessing signing in blood from my baby doesn’t qualify as a loophole.” You say.\n“Oh it probably would have, if I didn’t anticipate you potentially attempting such a thing. Hence why I proposed the idea to Gikil and had the contract changed, guessing you didn’t bother re-reading it closely.” Big Red interrupts, still reading over the contract.\n“Yeah, and I made sure Big Red agreed to spare my soul if I was the one who got you pregnant and go along with the plan. Face it, I fucked you every which way I could and I enjoyed every fucking moment of it! You don’t know how long I’ve waited for the day that I didn’t have to put up with your condescending arrogance anymore! You deserve everything you’re going to get and so am I!” Gikil gloats.\n“Hm, you might be right about that one, Gikil.” You say.\n\nBig Red interrupts again.\n\n“I have to admit, I am a bit surprised this plan worked. I didn’t think you’d fall for it. While I’m happy that it did, I’m mildly disappointed that you were so foolish enough to believe a fool like your traitorous minion here. In fact…oh…oh…I see what you did…clever.” Big Red’s voice says with a mixture of emotion.\n\nYou smile which causes Gikil to look back and forth at you and Big Red rapid succession. Big Red is just shaking his head still looking at the contract.\n\n“What?! WHAT?! What did she do?!” he exclaims.\n“Remember that reference you made about getting fucked in the ass good and hard? Well, that was only part of what I engaged to return the favor for your attempted failed and honestly quite predictable treachery.” You remark.\n“Yeah, that kid isn’t yours Gikil. I cannot detect your essence in the blood at all.”\n\nIt takes a moment for Gikil to process, but then he does and…\n\n“You mean she fucked another guy and pretended it was mine the whole time? You fucking whore bitch!”\n\nYou chuckle and just utter “Cuck.”\n\n“Yep, I’m afraid our deal is null and void Gikil. You didn’t carry out the deed.” Big Red says.\n“But…but…fuck! Shit! Fine! I’ll die here then, but I’m going to at least take satisfaction that SHE is going to be a slave in hell for all eternity!” Gikil shouts.\n“Yeah, hate to take away the consolation prize, but she fucked me over as well. I can only detect her essence in the blood and even that is weak compared to the utter nothingness I detected. This baby wasn’t full svelk, it was a halfbreed.”\n“Halfbreed? But…there’s no others on this continent except the undead and…”\n\nGikil trails off and looks at you in disbelief.\n\n“You…you fucked a dero?!” Gikil says.\n“Yep, and as unpleasant as an experience to lower myself in such a way, that little twisted freak was still better at it than you were.” You say.\n“Normally it wouldn’t matter who the father was, but as I’ve mentioned to Semra, the dero are a tainted cursed race. She’s successfully befouled the blood of her baby by breeding with one of them. Well I guess I only have myself to blame for even mentioning the status of the dero, even if it seemed inconsequential at the time.” Big Red says with a heavy sigh.\n\n“But…but…doesn’t that render the contract null and void?!” Gikil asks.\n“Nope, it’s not something I anticipated, so the contract still stands while her soul is safe from me...for now.” Big Red says looking over at you.\n\nGikil collapses to the floor in despair. He thought he was being so clever and has found his pitiful plan come to ruin.\n\n“At least you got to share my bed a few times, which is the greatest achievement a lowly unimaginative male such as yourself could accomplish. Are you seriously about to cry? Pathetic.”\n\nGikil turns to you in his grief of his fate and his face is one of violent rage.\n\n“Fuck you Semra, FUCK YOU!” he shouts getting up and grabbing his weapon with the intent of murdering you.\n\nNaturally you were expecting some sort of last attempt at killing you and you easily strike down Gikil with a blast of lightning, frying him instantly. He collapses to the ground not quite dead and smoking until you set him on fire to put him down for good (and his potential rising corpse).\n\nYou now turn your attention to Big Red.\n\n“Well if you’re done, we can get going. I’ll open up the portal to the infernal realm and from there open up another one to a world similar to what this one used to be. Silly question, but are you taking anyone with you? The contract did allow you to, though I can’t imagine you won’t be having the numbers you originally had in mind given that you’ve pissed off most, if not all of them.” Big Red says.\n\nNot so much of a silly question as it is an already answered one since Big Red isn’t far off on his comments and assumptions. There aren’t many left to even save anymore and you’re hardly inclined to bother at this point.\n\nPerhaps if things had worked out differently, you might have very well led masses of svelk into a new world where you could all start over again. You weren’t completely opposed to the idea after all.\n\nWhile you’re not exactly going to be leading your civilization to conquer the new world, there’s still the option to taking what remains, if only so you won’t be completely going it alone.\n",
  "page 83": "In these last couple years, you’ve come to the inevitable conclusion that all of this was about you from the start. Granted you always sort of knew that already.\n\nSure, you could take this entire fortress of a hundred or so svelk left and start over. Forge a new svelk Empire, conquer the lessers, but for what purpose really? It ultimately fell apart the first time it was tried. Then later when you actually managed to reunify them again, you weren’t exactly appreciated for your efforts. All you got were complaints, whining, backstabbing, assassination attempts and treason.\n\nWhy the hell would you bother putting yourself in that position again just to save a group that is inherently ungrateful anyway?\n\nNo. They can die along with this world. You’re obviously the best example of the race anyway. As long as you survive, the svelk will survive.\n\nAnd you’re certainly a survivor.\n\n“No. Open the portal.” You say to Big Red.\n\nBig Red nods and opens a glowing dark red portal.\n\n“Well? Ladies first.” Big Red says.\n\nYou take a deep breath and exhale as you walk towards the portal. You pause before it, and feel the heat emanating from the portal. Even the glow look ominous, there’s no question where this one is going.\n\nYou look back at your room realizing that this will be the last time you will ever set eyes on your world again. You briefly think about all your life choices that led you to this point and whisper.\n\n“Goodbye Francis.”\n\nYou step into the portal…\n\nYou find yourself in a hostile looking wasteland with a red sky. It’s unbearably hot as well. In the distance your can see figures flying about and large black fortresses amongst the rocky landscape.\n\nStrange noises of all sorts come from various directions and you feel very vulnerable. It’s not a big improvement from where you just came from.\n\nAt first you think Big Red has broken the deal, but he soon pops in near you and starts to open up another portal.\n\n“Hold on, opening up portals to other worlds from THIS side isn’t exactly as common as mortals like to believe for us. Takes a lot of power and the only reason why I’m even able to rip open a portal to this one, is because the barriers there between this realm and it are a little weak right now, thanks to multiple succubus incursions there. Plus I have all these new souls you’ve given me to help with opening it. Feel free to to explore my home in the meantime.” Big Red says.\n“Considering your home’s name certainly fits everything I’ve heard about the place, I think I’ll just be staying put until you finish up here.” You reply.\n\nYou continue to look around you expecting an attack at any moment while Big Red is casting his spell.\n\n“So, you said this new world would be similar to mine. In what way?” you ask.\n“Well, it’s roughly the same technological level, magic exists there, probably most of the same races exist, though they might be different than the versions on your world.” Big Red explains.\n“So there might be svelk there?” you ask.\n“Maybe, I dunno. I don’t bother with the details of every world; I’m not a god. Speaking of which, there ARE deities that actually do shit on this world on occasion, so there’s a major difference from your world.”\n“And they’re just going to let you open a portal to it from the infernal realm?”\n“Not like they can stop me from here. Besides, I just said they were active, not watching constantly over every little thing, not to mention more than a few of those gods are assholes who don’t give a shit about the well being of mortals. Anyway stop talking, I need to focus on this.”\n\nYou comply with Big Red’s request since you really do want to be out of this place as soon as possible.\n\nWhile it seems like forever, eventually Big Red opens up another portal. This one is displaying a green field of grass and a blue sky. You can’t tell much else, but looks more pleasant than this place or your own world.\n\n“There you go. It’s open and ready for you to enter.” Big Red says.\n\nYou don’t say anything except nod and make your way towards the portal. You’re about to enter when you suddenly feel Big Red’s hand grab your arm strongly. You look up a bit at him and you see an expression you haven’t seen from him before: Serene anger.\n\nYou get the very strong impression that he wants you to try something. Obviously he’s dropped the pretense of being a “charming” negotiating demon as the aura he’s giving off now is enough to make even you feel a healthy dose of fear. His stare is probably looking quite literally into your soul.\n\n“Before you go, I just want you to know I haven’t simply dismissed how you managed to cheat your way out of the contract.” Big Red says.\n“I didn’t cheat. I outwitted you.” You remark.\n\nYou feel a tighter squeeze on your arm. You continue to look Big Red in his eyes despite the fact that fear is starting to turn into terror. In fact you blink for a brief moment you see something much larger, meaner and uglier in your presence. Then it’s gone. You wonder if you just saw Big Red’s true form.\n\n“I know you’re scared mortal despite the attempt at brave defiance you’re putting on right now.”\n\nThere’s a part of you that wants to make a last ditch effort to attack, you might even escape, but probably with one less arm at best. And again, you know that Big Red wants you to attack since it would give him an excuse to render the contract null and void.\n\nThere’s also a part of you that just wants to meekly surrender to Big Red’s power trip. He’d probably let you go quicker, and while he’d still lose, he’d get the satisfaction of making you quiver like a little girl.\n\nBut then you didn’t make it this far by just laying back and taking it. (Even when you literally were laying back and taking it)\n\n“Fine, but you said it yourself that you only have yourself to blame for not anticipating every loophole.” You say.\n\nBig Red immediately squeezes down tighter on your arm, which now feels like it’s being cut off as his claws are now digging into your flesh. In fact your whole body starts to feel like it’s being set on fire causing you to crumple to your knees as Big Red still grips your arm looking down at you.\n\n“You are of course correct and I even respect what you managed to do in some small way.” Big Red says with a smile and then slowly starts to release your arm, at which point the pain throughout your body also fades.\n\nYou get up, rubbing your arm a bit while looking at him, saying nothing and quickly making your way to the portal.\n\n“I look forward to our next encounter Semra.” Big Red says.\n\nYou step into the portal and you feel like you’re floating with your sight filled with a lot of flashing blue and green light before you feel like you’re back on solid ground again.\n\nYou’re on a field of healthy green grass and a bright blue sky above you. You look around and see that you’re practically in the middle of nowhere, except there’s a road nearby, so you can at least follow and see where that leads. The portal is gone.\n\nAs you start to walk, you try to put aside the fear that Big Red put in you just a few moments ago. You shiver a bit just thinking about how close you actually were being in the infernal realm forever.\n\nBig Red also implied he’d look forward to your next encounter, you get the strong impression that he isn’t going to just let what you did go.\n\nBut that’s a problem for another day, you realize your short-term goals for now are to learn more about this world and get your bearings. Determine who can be useful and how you’ll be treated.\n\nIt’ll take some time, but you figure you can start forming ideas about what your long term goals are as you gather information.\n\nYou aren’t sure how you’re going to go about things in general, but rest assured it’s going to be different than how you handled things on your own world.\n\nIt’s a brand new world and it’s all yours for the taking.\n",
  "page 85": "Eternal Mistress\n\n\nYears later…\n\n“Is it standard practice for the Syndicate to keep important clients waiting this long?” you ask.\n“You’ll wait as long as it takes the boss to get here and you’ll like it. I’ll remind you that it’s only due to you offering such a large sum of coin that this deal is taking place. It better all be here.” Devon replies.\n“You can have your people unload the chests from the wagon right now, go ahead and count it if you wish.”\n“Don’t worry we will.”\n\nThe Syndicate lieutenant gives you a dirty look and turns his back completely on you. Complete disrespect. This human is so confident in his abilities and position that almost as if by doing so he’s daring you to attack him.\n\nNo matter what world, humans are the same all over. Too overconfident in their meager abilities when they never have any right to be. They seem to be all over the fucking place on this world too. The only up side is at least they are as predictable here as they were on your own world.\n\nStill, there was a time and place for you when such behavior would never have happened. Even when you spoke to so called rulers, you still commanded respect.\n\nThere’s a part of you that sometimes wonders if you shouldn’t have at least taken a few of your people with you since you’ve yet to encounter anyone similar to your own race.\n\nAnd you’re not counting those barbaric sveld or “elves” as they’re also commonly called here. Other than the superficial appearance they’re nothing like you. Most of the ones you’ve encountered are even less civilized than the ones that were on your world. At least the ones on your world were just a weak sub-race split off from your own superior one. The ones here seem to mainly be a bunch of hedonistic painted degenerates that dance around in the trees naked and the ones that live in the cities aren’t much better.\n\nBut then such are the failings of the lesser born. In fact you’re reminded of just how many in your life have failed you, including your own people. No, it’s better that you started completely fresh, no need for encumbrances of the past.\n\nEven if one particular one still enters your thoughts now and then.\n\n“Francis would have conquered half of this world by himself already.” You say to yourself with smile.\n\n\n“Hey you.” A Syndicate member shouts as three of them approach you. You can tell by the looks on their faces this is going to be yet more poor attempts of unnecessary posturing.\n\n“Yes?” you answer already mentally predicting their comments.\n“We noticed you have absolutely no back up for this meeting. Even our Shadow boys detected nothing invisible or lurking in the trees nearby.” One of them with a black claw on his left arm says.\n“That’s correct. Should I have back up? I was under the impression that the ECS deals fairly with its customers. Not really good business practice backstabbing them for no reason otherwise.”\n“True. However, you’re still awfully trusting being out here alone with a wagon full of gold by yourself in the woods. It would be really easy to rob you…or worse if we were so inclined.”\n“Hmm, perhaps I’m a powerful sorceress and need no back up.”\n“Hah. Nice try, but if you had any magic abilities, again our Shadows would have detected them.”\n“Well I guess you called my bluff and I’d be at your mercy.”\n“Indeed. Guess it’s a good thing we’re all honorable men here.”\n“I suppose it is. So exactly what would YOU do to me? Hm?” you ask mildly seductively.\n“Heh, I knew you were like that. I could just tell. You got the body and face and you walk about knowing what you’re doing the entire time. Swinging your hips, flipping your hair and all that other shit. What would I do though? I’d bend you over good and give it to you hard. I get the impression you like it rough.”\n“You’re more observant than you would appear. Mildly intriguing. So what else would you do? I mean your scenario doesn’t sound very interesting in the scheme of things. You have your two friends over there and I got two more paths to pleasure, wouldn’t they be joining us?”\n\nThe one with the tattoo looks over at his two comrades and chuckles before looking back at her.\n\n“Oh, you want THAT do you? Well that could be arranged too. Just one question though, we’ve been trying to figure out.”\n“What’s that?”\n“What exactly are you? None of us have ever seen someone like you before. You look sort of like an elf, but your skin is way darker than those mostly pale tree huggers. You don’t have succubus blood in you do you? Because I’ve heard stories about those types.”\n“No. I’m…unique. And I guarantee after tonight, you’ll never see anyone like me ever again.”\n\nBefore any of the Syndicate members can respond to your statement, Devon approaches again.\n\n“HEY! What the fuck are you lot doing?! I told you assholes to unload that fucking wagon and take it over to ours! And as for you, come over here, the boss has arrived.” Devon says.\n“We’ll pick this up later boys.” You say and follow him.\n\nAfter a short walk through the trees, you reach a clearing where the boss of this operation stands, Eric, another grim looking man with only business in mind. Next to him a wagon with young human children of all types huddle together in a large cage.\n\n“Is this them?” you ask.\n“Yeah, this is all what you asked for.” Eric answers.\n\nYou walk over to the cage to get a closer look and after a brief scan at the scared little ragamuffins, you shake your head.\n\n“Bah, these lot are going to take so much time and money to train.” You exclaim.\n“Well, that’s not my problem, you asked for young children. If you wanted warriors right from the start, you could have gone elsewhere.” Eric says.\n“I don’t want just warriors, I desire something more and I can only get that if I train them directly from a young age. In any case, I’ll be taking my coin back.” You say.\n“Nice joke, but all sales are final.”\n“I understand that, but I’m taking my coin back.”\n“You don’t seem to understand at all because I’m telling you this isn’t a fucking trader’s bazaar. You aren’t getting your fucking coin back because you don’t like what you’ve paid for already.”\n\nEric follows up by giving you a stern threatening look, which causes you to laugh.\n\n“No YOU don’t seem to understand, I’m taking my coin AND the children.”\n\nYou begin to cast and without another word, Eric immediately disappears using his shadow magic also causing the surroundings around you to slow down.\n\nOf course this is a form of magic you’re all too familiar with and the Empire’s old Shadow Guard was much more skilled in using it than these magic dabbling criminals.\n\nYou utter a simple word and instantly not only does Eric unwillingly become visible, but so do several shadows that were approaching you. The advantage of their speed is also completely nullified.\n\nEric’s face has changed from one of grim seriousness to shock when he realizes his advantage has been lost. You dodge the dagger coming straight at your face and easily grab his arm, disintegrating it before his eyes.\n\nEric screams as he sees a stump where his limb used to be, you follow by kicking him in the his chest knocking the wind out of him and on to the ground.\n\nThe other ECS members attempt to stop you, but to no avail, you’ve stripped away their advantage. You melt the face of the first attacker then stab the second in the throat with your own dagger.\n\nYou dodge a few attacks from the next two shadow users before blasting them both with a freezing ray and then shattering them.\n\nYou see Devon running away, but with a flick of your hand several of the weapons lying on the ground raise up and fly straight towards his back. He’s impaled by every one of them and falls to the ground dead.\n\nSurprisingly you see Eric back on his feet and also trying to run off. This is stopped however with another disintegration spell to his legs this time. More screaming follows from the near limbless ECS Boss and you leave the area to go track down the last survivors.\n\n“Come on! Come on! Just grab what you can, it sounds like some bad shit is going down!”\n“Alright let’s get on the wagon and get the hell out of here!”\n“Okay, I’m…fuck!” the Claw member says looking down at his chest and seeing a blade coming out of it.\n\nYou pull the blade out of his back and run to catch the other two lowly thugs that were harassing you earlier.\n\nAs the other two scrambled to get on their wagon, you cut down another before he can even reach it. The last one left is the charming fellow with the claw tattoo. He turns to you and begs for his life pathetically.\n\n“Please! Spare my life! You can take everything, just let me go!”\n“Let you go? And here I thought you were going to bend me over and give it to me hard. You lot are always so full of promises and then come up short.”\n\nAlready tiring of his pleas, which were just as boring as his previous proposal, you end this distraction with a quick beheading.\n\n“Told you that after tonight, you’d never see anyone like me again.”\n\nHaving dispatched the last of the ECS members, you cast a spell to calm down the horses, which were about to run off from all this excitement going on around them.\n\nYou return to the clearing and find Eric desperately still attempting to crawl away with one arm left. You kick him to roll him over. He knows he’s done for.\n\n“Do it, my soul is already prepared for the Shadow God Fel.” Eric exclaims trying to put on a brave front in the face of doom.\n“Fel huh? So that’s what you shadow magic users call him here. Interesting.” You reply.\n“You…you won’t get away with this. The Syndicate is going to put a contract on your head and you won’t have ANYWHERE to run to. Our reach is long.”\n“I’m sure that’ll be interesting as well.”\n“Who…who are you anyway?”\n“Who am I? What am I? I seem to be getting a lot of questions like that tonight. Not sure that it matters at this point, but since you’ve been such a good sport about all this, why not?”\n\nYou stand over Eric with a complete sense of superiority and then utter the words that compliment such a stance.\n\n“I am Semra D’vessa, last of the svelk people. I escaped the death of my world only to find myself on yet another world filled with ignorant lessers. It doesn’t matter though, I will overcome this as I have overcome everything else in my life and this is just a minor step in what will ultimately be my complete victory.”\n\nThis proclamation is of course completely lost on Eric. You’re not even sure why he bothered to ask. Bored of dragging this out, you set him on fire and ignore his screams as you go over to the children still locked in the large cage. They’ve certainly seen a lot tonight and predictably all of them are crying.\n\nExcept one and that one grabs your attention.\n\nA little blonde boy just stares at the screaming burning sack of flesh. He’s not crying. He’s not doing anything except just staring at Eric in his last agonizing moments. The little boy’s eyes also glance at the other dead bodies in the area that you’ve created tonight.\n\n“You, boy. Come to the door of the cage.” You demand.\n\nThe boy obeys and you unlock the cage with a spell, pulling the boy out and getting a closer look at him. There’s nothing excessively special about the boy. You detect nothing about him that would indicate that he isn’t just another ignorant monkey.\n\nHe stares at you back, never looking away and keeps eye contact. There’s no fear. He’s so brave.\n\nHe reminds you of someone similar.\n\n“Boy, do you understand that your life is about to change severely and that if you wish to live long enough to enjoy your pathetically short time here that you are going to have to obey me?” you ask.\n“Um…yes?” the boy stumbles to answer.\n“That didn’t sound certain, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!”\n\nYou slap the boy to the ground. To his credit, he still doesn’t cry.\n\n“Yes! Yes I understand Sem…” the boy begins to say before you quickly kneel down to put your hand over his mouth.\n\nApparently the boy was also listening closely to your words to Eric earlier. You’re pleased that he was so observant, but he will still need to learn.\n\n“Oh no little one. You don’t get to address me by that name, at least not yet. For now, you will call me Mistress.” You whisper in his ear before licking it.\n\n“Remember this.”\n",
  "page 121": "As much as you’d rather not, you feel leaving Nuro is the smartest choice if only to keep yourself safer from those that would seek to stomp out your magic choice of interest.\n\nYou head back to your “home” and pack up your belongings. You aren’t sure where you’re going to go. You have some knowledge of the areas surrounding Nuro based on what you’ve read and overheard, but leaving the city is an idea that really gives you a lot of anxiety and concern.\n\nYou don’t even know why exactly. You’ve dealt with far more dangerous situations.\n\nYou ultimately decide to travel to the Tulan Kingdom since from what you’ve heard; it has a somewhat more “relaxed” policy on dark magic. Or at least it openly consorts with demons more readily than other places. Any place like that is more likely to be easier to keep a low profile in while still maintaining the civilized world conveniences. (You’re still a city girl and you’re not exactly keen on the idea of living off the land)\n\nIt’s going to be a long journey though and you’re certainly not going to walk all the way. The next morning, you seek out one of those carriages to transport you, luckily manage to find one.\n\nThe driver is wearing cloth over his face and some sort of goggles. When you approach he looks down at you and tells you the price. It’s a little high but then money hasn’t really ever been an issue for you since you learned to live on your own.\n\nYou pay the driver who takes your coins. He tells he’ll be leaving as soon as he gets more passengers. You step into the carriage which is a lot more roomy than it looked from the outside. You take a seat and try to keep yourself calm about the upcoming trip.\n\nIt won’t be so bad. You got used to not living in the orphanage, you’ll get used to not living Nuro. Maybe you need a change of scenery anyway.\n\nDoesn’t take long before someone enters the carriage, two in fact. It’s a woman and her young daughter. The mother sees you and tells her daughter to sit on the other side of the carriage after which she does likewise.\n\n“I’m going to see my daddy in the Tulan Kingdom!” the little girl exclaims to you.\n“Shhh! What did I tell you about talking to strangers? Just sit there quietly for the trip and don’t open your mouth.” Her mother scolds and then looks at you before looking through her purse for something. She gives you another dirty look before pulling out a book to read.\n\nA few moments later, another person enters the carriage. This one is a fatter young man probably a few years older than you. Unsurprisingly he sees you and sits right next to you.\n\n“Well hello ladies. You all heading to the Tulan Kingdom as well?” he asks, though he doesn’t get an answer from any of you. (The little girl nearly answers until her mother glares at her)\n\nDoesn’t stop him from continuing to pester you though.\n\n“Hey, you look familiar. Do you go to the magic college?” he asks you.\n“Uh, no.” you answer.\n“Hm, could have swore I’d seen a pretty girl like you around the campus before. I guess you do look a little on the younger side to be attending a college. Anyway, I just finished my first year and heading back home for a family visit even though I’d rather not, but you know how family can be right? Always want you to check in and all.”\n\nYou ignore his comment and go back to looking out the window, hoping the carriage starts rolling soon.\n\nOne more person enters the carriage and there’s just enough room for him to squeeze in next to the mother. He’s an older man wearing traveller clothing and a sword and brace of pistols are openly displayed on his person. If you had to guess, maybe he’s some sort of bounty hunter. He says nothing, but he does give you a long stern looks when you glance over at him. He’s even worse than the mother in this regard.\n\nYou look at the mother again who is reading her book. The daughter who was more talkative before has now become quiet and when you look at her even she backs herself up more against her seat and looks away.\n\nYou realize that maybe this hostility stems from the “dark aura” Big Red said you were giving off. Pity it’s NOT working on the fat young man sitting near you because he’s still trying to engage you in conversation. He start to mention how he’s majoring in illusions when the driver shouts that he’s leaving.\n\nAs the carriage leaves Nuro, you look out the window taking in the wilderness for the first time. It’s much different than the Nuro park. You’re actually a little fascinated by it all. Of course looking out the window is a lot more desirable than looking at your travelling companions who are either hostile or overly talkative.\n\nYou can’t keep staring out the window the whole trip though so you try the next best way of escape by closing your eyes to sleep.\n\nYou aren’t sure how much time passes, but the next time you open your eyes, it’s getting dark. You glance at the three sitting across from you and the older man and the mother both look at you with the same dislike in their eyes. The little girl is asleep.\n\nYou turn your head and the fat young man smiles at you.\n\n“Well, you’re awake again. I thought you had been ignoring me earlier until I realized you had just fallen asleep. Like I was saying, you have to have a really high intelligence level to master illusions. The willpower to make illusions feel like reality is just…well I’ll just show you!”\n\nIt would appear that one is unfortunately still too friendly towards you. He immediately starts to cast a small spell creating flowers which then dissipate into a mist of colors. Doesn’t impress you, but he’s gotten the little girl’s attention who apparently woke up from all the noise he was making.\n\n“Ohhh pretty! Do it again!” she exclaims.\n“Yeah, do it again. You seem to enjoy trying to impress girls much younger than yourself.” You say in an attempt to shut down this annoying idiot for good.\n\nYour remark gets a look of shock from him, but also from the mother.\n\n“Wha…” he says.\n“Excuse me?! I don’t want my daughter to hear you talk such filth!” she says.\n“Why are you giving me grief? This one is the one that’s been creeping on me the whole time despite the fact he himself said I’m too young to be in college. If anything I’ve called him out on being a pervert. You oughta be giving him the stink eye not me!” you exclaim.\n\nAt this point the mother starts yelling at you, while the fat young man who has been hitting on you starts to protest his innocence.\n\n“Hey now, I was just being friendly, no need for name calling and accusations. Just calm down darling.”\n\nThese hollow words followed by patting you on the leg to get his point across was a very poor judgment on his part. While he probably figured copping a feel would be worth a potential slap, he didn’t count on you reacting in a much more violent way.\n\nYou look at his hand and then your mind goes into a darkness.\n\n“ROT” you utter and suddenly the young man’s hand shrivels before everyone. He screams holding his decrepit boney hand.\nThe mother and daughter scream as well and hold each other, but the bounty hunter springs into action.\n\n“I knew it! I knew you were a necromancer!” he shouts and pulls one of his pistols.\n\nThe carriage though hits a bumpy patch causing the hunter to miss you and shoot the fat man in the face. Blood splatters on you, but you’re not fazed at all and cast a bolt black at the hunter, killing the man instantly.\n\nYour attention turns the mother and daughter now. Gone is the disgust and only the fear remains on the mother’s face.\n\n“Maybe you were right after all.” You say and do the same thing to them that you did to the hunter. The pair die in each other’s arms screaming.\n\nThe carriage continues its bumpy journey and you’re now sharing its interior with four corpses. You push the fat one’s body away from you. You’re mildly annoyed you didn’t get to kill him personally.\n\nYou briefly wonder why the carriage hasn’t stopped, the driver surely had to hear all the commotion.\n\nYou don’t wonder for long though since the carriage does stop.\n\n“Alright, we’re here. Everyone out.” You hear him shout.\n\nYou look outside the window and see…well nothing. It’s pitch black outside. The most you can make out is the road immediately near the carriage.\n\n“Well Catalina? Aren’t you getting out? You’re at your destination.”\n\nHow the hell did the driver know your name? Something is wrong here and if this driver has any tricks up his sleeve, he’s going to be joining the rest of the passengers here. You step out of the carriage.\n\nAnd that’s when you see that you are not in the Tulan Kingdom. You’re not even on the road. You’re in a huge graveyard and somewhat confused. You turn around back to the carriage and see the driver still sitting on top of it. He’s fiddling with his face wrap though.\n\n“What’s wrong? This was your true destination was it not?” he says and removes his face wrap revealing a grinning skull. The goggles come off next exposing hollow sockets.\n\nThe four dead bodies inside the carriage start to exit the carriage and move towards the graveyard, ignoring you completely.\n\n“Young, old, male, female, fat, thin, doesn’t really matter does it? That’s where they all end up. Beautiful isn’t it?” The driver says.\n\nSuddenly the driver appears right before you.\n\n“And that’s where you’re going to help send all of them. Help them see the beauty.” The driver whispers and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nInteresting, but that didn’t happen. These false memories are sometimes very bizarre. You can only guess its all-mental images mixing with bits of reality and imagination. Hell, you’ve been here for who knows how long now and you still haven’t got it all figured out yet.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 120": "As dangerous things are potentially getting in sticking around in Nuro, there’s something about leaving it that still causes you a bit of anxiety. Strange that it should given your past experiences that have been far more life threatening.\n\nThis now leaves you to do some searching for the cabal of necromancers that Big Red told you about. You aren’t sure where to look until it suddenly occurs to you that once again Big Red probably told you indirectly and you might find them in the conjuration building.\n\nOf course this also makes you wonder if Big Red is setting you up again somehow. Or he isn’t and you’re just second guessing because Big Red being a demon would love to fuck with a mortal mind in that way.\n\nIn any case, it’s as good a start as any; so you decide you’ll head over there and just be prepared.\n\nThe conjuration building is on the complete opposite side of the campus of the library you stay at, so it makes sense you never bothered to go over there. Not only that, but you didn’t see much point in summoning magical animals, given that’s about the only thing conjuration is good for and it’s highly restricted anyway. You especially can’t summon demons, not that you’d want to.\n\nOf course now that you think about it, maybe it does make sense that other necromancers would hang out in a place where a barely legal form of magic is taught.\n\nEventually you get to the building, which doesn’t particularly stand out from the others on campus. You do see a few more demon janitors in there and as usual they start avoiding you and making a few insulting comments as well.\n\nWhile it’s late and classes probably aren’t in session, you figure that if there is a cabal of necromancers here, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t still be around somewhere. Of course you’re just guessing at all this.\n\nSuddenly you hear a voice, at first you think it’s another demon janitor insulting you, but instead it’s a young woman with red hair.\n\n“Ugh! That smell! Sebastian, I thought you… oh. Who the fuck are you?!” she asks demandingly.\n“Uh, I’m new.” You say.\n“I’ll fucking say! Didn’t Mr. Demar train all you dead lovers to mask your magic aura? Shit, you smell worse than that ugly ass Sebastian!”\n“Yeah Mr. Demar said that was the next thing he was going to show me. I…uh forgot where his office is though.”\n“Well it’s two lefts, a right, straight ahead, another left, down the stairs, a left and a right. He should still be in there.”\n“Wait, two lefts, a right and what?”\n“Two lefts, a right, bah never mind I’ll just take you there before you get lost and call attention to a campus security guard that decided to patrol here tonight. Though given how you smell, I don’t know how the fuck you haven’t drawn their attention in the first place.”\n“I…uh use enchantment magic a lot.”\n“Hm, well that’s only going to go so far. Come on and quickly, because I don’t want to smell you any longer than possible!”\n\nThe woman says her name is Felsa and quickly tells you to follow her.\n\nYou heard Big Red mention a Mr. Demar, you can only guess he must be in charge of the cabal of necromancers. You’re a little puzzled though by this Felsa that she would be offended by your “smell” if she’s a necromancer herself.\n\nWhile you’re heading down one of the corridors, Felsa looks over at you and speaks again.\n\n“You look a little on the young side and I don’t recall ever seeing you in any classes. You a freshman?” Felsa asks.\n“Yeah, that obvious huh?” you say.\n“It’s beyond obvious. You’re lucky Mr. Demar noticed you when he did, because like I said, it’s amazing you haven’t gotten questioned by campus security. I’m betting you get a lot of people avoiding you though.”\n“Yeah. So how long have you been a necromancer?”\n“Me? I’m not a fucking dead lover. I’m a demonologist! You couldn’t tell?”\n“Oh. Yeah, I’m still a little bad at sensing others specialties.”\n“Meh, I suppose you couldn’t have known, I’ve been able to completely mask the brimstone. Though we demonologists also have the advantage of there being actual demons on campus so we can always make that excuse. Anyway, watch your step.”\n\nThe pair of you go down the stairs, and now you’re a little confused. You thought this was a cabal of necromancers. There’s demonologists too? Summoning demons is just as illegal as necromancy, so maybe it’s a coalition of such people. Though you’re not really keen on associating with demon worshippers.\n\nEventually you get to Mr. Demar’s office. Felsa opens up the door and you see an older man busily shuffling some papers around.\n\n“Damn it! I thought I locked that door! Felsa, what do you…and what do we have here?” Mr. Demar says taking immediate interest in you.\n“This newbie…what is your name anyway?” Felsa says.\n“Catalina.” You answer, already expecting your mild deception to be unveiled.\n“Catalina said she needed to find your office to help train her to mask her necromantic aura. And I’d say not a minute too soon!”\n“Hm, yes, we do need to take care of that. Thank you Felsa, you may go.”\n\nFelsa nods and rushes out the door in an effort to get away from the smell, leaving you and Mr. Demar together. Mr. Demar gets up from his seat and makes a small gesture with his hand where upon you hear the door firmly lock.\n\n“So…Catalina. How did we miss you? Or rather how did you know to seek us out?” Mr. Demar asks stepping around his desk to approach you.\n“Big Red…” you start to say before Mr. Demar interrupts.\n“Ah of course, Big Red. And how is that scheming demon? He’s still failed to deliver on some books I paid for.”\n“He tried to get me to deliver a black cube to you, but I didn’t trust him.”\n\nMr. Demar chuckles.\n\n“Well that proves you’re smarter than Felsa, who apparently just believed you to be a new student of mine…are you even a student at this college? You look slightly younger than most.”\n“No. I’ve been living in the old library for a few years now.”\n“Interesting. Y’know I once considered that to be the hiding spot as it were, but then I figured hiding in plain sight worked just as well given the fools on this campus, along with the help of the demonic janitors. In any case Catalina, I can tell you’ve come here seeking answers, but before you find any, I’m going to have to know more about you. And I mean your whole backstory.”\n“All of it?”\n“Come now, it can’t be that long, you’re what? Sixteen or seventeen maybe at most? Just start from the beginning of when you first developed your affinity towards necromancy. I’m sure it’s an interesting tale.”\n\nSeeing little other choice, you sit and proceed to tell Mr. Demar of your history. The grave wings, the orphanage, practicing magic, living in the old library, all of it.\n\nWhile you’re telling your tale, Mr. Demar listens intently, not really interrupting other than a few times for clarification on a some things. When you’re finished, he looks at you a bit and after a quick stroke of his beard, he speaks.\n\n“You took a lot of risks in staying in Nuro, you took an even bigger risk coming here, however it would seem your risk has paid off since I’ve decided not to destroy you…yet” Mr. Demar says.\n“Thanks?” You answer.\n“Don’t thank me just yet, because as of right now you’ve been conscripted into the Dark Order. Such natural magical talent can’t be overlooked and will be put to use for our goals.”\n“Which are what exactly?”\n“Oh I’ll get to the details of that soon, but in short our mission is to correct the current order of this world by ensuring the truly powerful rule above the weak. But first, let’s take care of your unfortunate aura issue.”\n\nAt first you think he’s going to cast something himself, but instead he tells you how to do it. The funny thing is it’s so simple; you aren’t sure why you didn’t think of it yourself. You suppose that’s the benefits of learning from a teacher rather than just teaching yourself.\n\n“There. You smell better already and could easily fit in with the common learning class on campus, which you’ll be doing soon after I see what you can do personally. I want to see exactly how much I need to teach you and the other branches of magic that you know, because it’s important to not just rely on a single focus. Not being versatile enough can lead to enemies counter acting your strength and then where will you be? That’s why the Dark Order doesn’t just consist of a single branch of outlawed magic.”\n\nMr. Demar suddenly gets right in your face and both of his hands grab your wrists.\n\n“Now if we’re going to continue this potential relationship, I think it’s time to see your skills put to the test.”\n\nAt first you think he’s going to try to molest you in some way, but that’s not what he’s about. Instead you’re teleported to someplace dark with a few undead corpses wandering around. They see you and immediately attempt to attack until Mr. Demar holds them back.\n\n“Now that should last a few minutes. But it won’t last long after I leave. It’s going to be your job to control them. If you can do it, then we’ll have a place for you. If not, well, your body will at least serve in the war to come.”\n\nMr. Demar teleports away and you’re left alone with three corpses and no escape. You have to admit; you’ve never quite gotten the hang of controlling a single fully intact corpse, let alone three of them.\n\nYour first instinct is destroy at least two of them, but you know Mr. Demar wants to see if you’re actually capable of improving your necromantic skills. And quite frankly you do too.\n\nYou focus…\n\nThe three corpses shamble towards you. With some effort, you manage to stop one in its tracks. However the other two continue towards you.\n\nOne of them lunges at you and you barely manage to dodge, unfortunately you lose temporary control over the one you managed to hold the first time around.\n\nYou sprint as far as you can in this dark room and once again order the rotting bags of flesh to stop. You feel lightheaded temporarily like you’re going to pass out, but you manage to keep it together. In fact you feel a surge of energy like you never have before and you manage to hold two of them in place.\n\nThe third one continues to come at you, and you continue to try to control it. The desire to just set this thing on fire is great, but you resist. Even when its decayed hands are within reach of your body, you focus. The thing grabs at your neck even digging in its nails a bit, but you are undeterred. You WILL master this magic once and for all!\n\nAnd then it all clicks just as you’re starting to feel the effects of strangulation; the corpse releases its hands from your throat and backs away obediently. It then stands near its fellows.\n\nYou’ve done it at last.\nMr. Demar soon returns with a smile.\n\n“Good. I knew you’d succeed. Now that that’s over with, I can introduce you to the rest of your fellows. Never again will you be alone. You are now part of an order that will last forever and YOU will play an important role in it.”\n\nYou’re still not quite sure about all this, but for now, this will probably be an easier way to develop your ever-growing skills.\n",
  "page 6": "As much as you would like to personally deliver justice to Sinthinia, you’ve got a lot of other matters in the infernal realm to worry about. In fact you’ve got ALL of the infernal realm to concern yourself with.\n\nZel’s self-preservation of keeping you nearby aside, she also made some good points about the potential danger. She may even be correct in that Sinthinia is already dead. She was screaming and burning when you last saw her, perhaps it was some twisted joke by Big Red to disfigure and weaken her while he made her his bitch or something.\n\nYou suppose if you come across her again, you’ll just have to be more thorough in her destruction next time.\n\n“Very well, you make some good points Zel.” You remark.\n“I do? Oh yes, well thank you general!” Zel answers surprised that you took her advice.\n“Mm, don’t get too excited, I need you to start rebuilding war machines for our next conquest. So get back to your workshop and if you see Captain Spol tell him I want to see him immediately.”\n“Yes, general.”\n“And try not to suck his dick or anyone else’s on the way.”\n\nZel nods and bows before leaving.\n\nWhile Zeljenir runs off to go do your bidding, more of your officers start finding you to give various reports. It’s all very routine, when Captain Spolnapad shows up, you verbally and physically threaten him to not bother Zeljenir again. He complies and is full of promises to obey, though you suspect you’ll probably have to do something more permanent to him in the long run.\n\nAfter the traditional allowance of a victory celebration, you solidify your position before moving on to the next target. Should be a more mundane campaign than the one against Sinthinia.\n\nThe Future…\n\n“General, we’re losing ground to the abominations. We have to retreat! We can regroup at the Fortress of Torment, our position is strong there.” One of your commanders exclaims.\n\nRetreat, regroup, repeat. That’s all you’ve been hearing for the past few years. You’re sick of hearing it and you’re even more pissed about it always being true.\n\nYou can’t believe all your years of hard work has been undone within weeks by these unnatural invaders. They knew exactly where to strike and it was so fast and sudden, you’d lost nearly a third of your territory before you could even mount an offense.\n\nSinthinia lead the first attacks against your territory. She did indeed come back, though not the same at all. She was no longer a succubus or even infernal, she had been transformed into some sort of eldritch puppet spreading corruption to the land. It wasn’t too surprisingly that you were targeted first given your past with her.\n\nEven now Sin is one of the top commanders on the opposing side focusing on your holdings. You’ve tried to face her in one on one combat, but it’s only resulted in stand offs and in some cases your near death.\n\nMeanwhile underlings who feel they would be better to lead have made a few assassination attempts on you. You still wish that Zeljinir hadn’t been such a stupid whore and fell under the spell of the treacherous Captain Spol’s empty promises. She had much potential, but an example had to be made to ALL traitors.\n\nBetween external and internal strife, your shortsighted infernal rivals took advantage and you lost another third of your territory\n\nOf course it didn’t help them since these horrors attacked them as well, in fact the entire infernal realm itself is under attack. While the infernal realm was never a bastion of order, it still at least had some sort of consistency and you were on your way to bringing stability to it. All of that is gone now as this place gives way to more chaos every moment.\n\nLarge portions of it have begun to warp into something completely different. Something more akin to the invaders’ liking. Even native infernals are starting to transform if they aren’t killed outright.\n\nThe only glimmer of “hope” (Ironic in a place like this) is the unseen (and almost mythical) so called “Lords of Hell” are supposed to be setting things in motion to repel this invasion, but you aren’t holding your breath on that, and with the way things are going, you will have lost nearly all your territory before they get off their asses.\n\nAnd the thing about all this that pisses you off the most is YOU might have been able to prevent all this if you’d just pursued Sinthinia into that portal and put an end to her when you had the chance.\n\nThere’s nothing for it now of course.\n\nYou run your hand over your face and nod at your subordinate’s words.\n\n“Very well, take the majority of our forces to the Fortress. Send a couple of small detachment as distraction to the main abomination horde. Hopefully they’ll draw enough of unnatural bastards away before they’re all killed.” You order.\n\nWith your orders acknowledged and to be carried out, you start to make your own way to the Fortress of Torment and try to keep your mind dwelling on a plan for eventual victory in this war as opposed to the grim reality that the entire infernal realm is losing.\n\nYour own goals of uniting the infernal realm under your command have been abandoned in favor of survival.\n\nBut then you’ve always been good at that at least.\n",
  "page 145": "You sit in your garden, listening to your music and contemplating.\n\nIt’s the first major attempt you’ve tried with making a “band” and so far it’s not horrible.\n\nThese corpses were musicians in their past life so you’ve managed to keep their skills somewhat intact. The strings and percussions sound fine. A pity you can’t really have a woodwind or brass section, but the undead don’t really have the lung capacity for such things. At some point you’ll have to find a pianist.\n\nHowever, you aren’t contemplating your future plans for an entire symphony right now. You’re contemplating what you’re going to do about Azrael. You still aren’t sure about how you feel about him.\n\nThe positives are he’s been entrusting you with more responsibility. You thought you’d have more trouble trying to guide him into such a thing, but that’s actually not much of a problem as it was in the beginning. He largely leaves you to run the day-to-day operations of Aftermath now that he’s decided that it’s time to “expand.”\n\nHonestly you question if he even plans much at all so much as he just suddenly decides to do it. It’s little wonder that he decided to just let you do most of the more detailed work.\n\nWhich brings you to the negative that he recently just decided to make an alliance with a fucking vampire, who are supposed to be your enemies.\n\nHe claims that this “Ghoul King” is an outcast of his kind and will help, but you’re not so sure. You’ve had experience with vampires and you haven’t found them to be trustworthy.\n\nEven if he’s letting you primarily run things, you’re going to be cleaning up after him all the damn time if he’s going to be making a habit of making impulsive reckless decisions. He could very well fuck up things despite you guiding him in the direction you think he should go. You know Mr. Demar advised you to play puppet master, but there’s a part of you that wonders if things wouldn’t be easier if you took direct control. Sure it would give you even more work to do, but at least then you’d have complete power over your own destiny.\n\nOf course something like that could only be achieved by killing Azrael, which leads to the other problem.\n\nYou sort of like him.\n\nAfter your past experiences with potential partners, you haven’t had much luck in that area. It’s just been easier to just fuck a zombie every now and then and be done with the physical aspect.\n\nAzrael’s necromantic aura is very alluring to you though. Even more than Mr. Demar, it’s almost like he’s already undead. He’s also been relentless in still trying to woo you, which is oddly immature. He actually sent you a note once saying he liked you and asked if you liked him.\n\nYou think that was his goofy way of trying to make you laugh while also continuing to express his feelings. The damnedest thing is for some reason it did make you laugh and it really shouldn’t have given how dumb it was, but maybe that was the point.\n\nYou even kissed him on the cheek voluntarily not that long ago. You like to think you were just trying to keep him under your influence, but it was a little more than that. You’d be lying to yourself if it weren’t, in fact the more time you spend within his presence; the more you’re drawn to him. Not just on a physical level either since you do get the idea that he really does have strong feelings for you. He even found a couple of the skeletal musicians currently playing for you.\n\nThe funny thing is he’s probably so clueless, he doesn’t even realize just how close he’s succeeding in winning you over completely.\n\nAnd that’s one thing that scares you, potentially even more than leaving the walls of Aftermath. There’s the idea of would you lose “yourself” in the process of having a relationship with him. You’ve been fairly self-sufficient most of your life and the idea of becoming reliant on anyone emotionally isn’t appealing.\n\nBut what worries you more is, you’ve been close to people in the past and when there was a parting, it wasn’t pleasant for you. Granted those instances were different and not romantic, but still close enough that it sucked a lot and you’d rather not have to mentally go through anything like that again.\n\nGiven what path you and Azrael have chosen, there is a very real possibility that he could get killed by any number of enemies. Would you get over it if it happened? You like to think you’d be strong enough to, but who knows how attached you’d be at that point? Maybe grief would cripple and destroy you if he died.\n\nDeath is natural and inevitable for everyone. Even the undead aren’t immortal. They can be killed or decay into nothing. So why the hell are you even having these feelings of fear for potential loss? Even sillier is you aren’t even officially with this idiot, and you’re having these feelings! You hate this weakness.\n\nRight now while you have a fondness for him, you aren’t irrevocably attached yet. You’re pretty sure you could kill him if you chose to go that route.\n\nExcept you aren’t sure how you’re going to proceed yet, you just know you can’t go on as things are with Azrael for much longer.\n",
  "page 5": "This is hell; you’re ALWAYS going to have to clean up shit on some level. You’ve had to make excursions to other realms before and it hasn’t been too bad when you’ve returned. Your reputation has grown enough that you don’t need to micromanage every little thing now, indeed that’s the whole reason why you set up the Infernal Inquisition to help curb the chaos.\n\nAs for the danger to you, again you’re in HELL. You’re in danger every moment you’re here. What does it matter if you’re risking your life here or elsewhere?\n\nStill, never hurts to add some protection if possible. You’ll have to consult your armorers if there’s someway of improving yours against celestial energy. Hopefully they can prove useful by the time Zel gets her shit together with re-opening the portal.\n\n“Zel, get your shit together and re-open that portal quick as you can. I need to know if Sin is dead. I’m not going to just let her get away so she can plot revenge from some distance corner of the planes. Move!” You order.\n“But…” Zel begins to say before she sees your eye narrow.\n“Do I need to slam you through the wall this time?”\n“No general. I’ll get right on it.”\n\nWhile Zeljenir runs off to go do your bidding, more of your officers start finding you to give various reports. It’s all very routine, though you give commands to go fetch your best blacksmiths along with Captain Spolnapad.\n\nCaptain Spol strolls in as if he’s not in the presence of a superior being. His casual arrogance is annoying you more than you already are today.\n\n“You ask to see me?” Spol says.\n“Yes, tell me captain, do you like your dick?” you reply.\n“You called to ask me that?”\n“Answer the question.”\n“It gets the job done, so yes I have no complaints about it.”\n“Funny, because that’s ALL I get about it! I think you know what I’m talking about because I warned you before about your aggressive mating habits with valued staff!”\n“Wha…wait… I never fucking touched sergeant Klivinak! That bitch is lying!”\n“Interesting, I never mentioned her and this is the first I’m hearing about that. No I got a complaint about you from Zeljenir. Said you and some of your men tried to rape her.”\n“HER? She’s the one complaining about me?! She was sucking my cock gleefully! I barely even hit on her! As for some of the others, well I mean Zel IS a succubus and after she was done with me, she wasn’t quite satisfied. I think one of the boys slapped her ass too hard or something and she got pissy so now she’s trying to get us all in trouble. You know how those types are.”\n\nSpol’s words are not completely convincing. While you don’t doubt he’s partially telling the truth about Zel, you know that Spol is notorious for his sexual assault habits. Mostly on your enemies, but occasionally you have to clean up shit as usual. You imagine it started off with just him and Zel, then his boys wanted to join in and they all probably starting getting a lot rougher than she would have liked.\n\n“Spol, you’re going to execute five of your own men. I don’t give a shit who.” You order.\n“But…”\n“But what? You think ten is better? Good, so do I. Anything else?”\n“No general.”\n“Good. And I want you and your lot to stay away from Zel. I don’t give a shit if she’s spreading her legs right in front of you and telling you to come and get it. You will NOT touch her. She’s actually a very skilled engineer and has a hard enough time concentrating on important shit as it is. Understand?”\n“Yes general I understand. Your girlfriend is off limits.”\n\nYour eyes narrow and Spol suddenly realizes he’s made a poor choice of words.\n\nWith lightning reflexes, you kick him in the crotch and ram his head into the same wall you slammed Zel against earlier.\n\n“Got anymore smart comments? No? Well here’s one for you. I get one more report on you or your rape crew assaulting ANY one that is a useful member of this regime, I’ll have ALL of you executed and you personally are going to find yourself without YOUR valued member and a fate much worse than simple execution. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUCKING ORDER! NOW do you understand?”\n“Yes, general…” Spol groans before you throw him out of the room.\n\nWith that out of the way, you demand that everyone start hurrying the fuck up on getting you to wherever Sin escaped to.\n\nDoesn’t take long for Zel to come back and set everything up, takes her even less time to reopen the portal. However the celestial energy coming from it, still makes it less than pleasant to be around let alone enter. You’re really going to need that extra protection, but still opening the portal at least buys you time while you wait on that.\n\nWhile your best blacksmiths are working on that aspect, you boost your own personal magical protection and ask your more older scholarly types if there is anything else you might need, but other than a few obscure incantations that you weren’t aware of, you’re told that you’ll be as well protected as you possibly can be.\n\nEventually your improved armor and even an improved sword are given to you. You’re told that it should protect you from most of the celestial effects short of mounting an expedition to the heavens themselves. Thankfully from what Zel’s infernal technology has determined the portal leads to some odd “demi-plane.”\n\n“It’s definitely giving off a lot of celestial energy obviously, but it isn’t celestial in origin. I dunno, it’s odd. Never seen anything like this before, you’d probably be better off asking an infernal much older than myself if they know anything about a place like this.” Zel remarks.\n“It hardly matters what it is, my question is will I be able to leave it?” you ask.\n“Yeah, I can reopen the portal now that a link has been better established, but you’re going to have to be in the area where you arrive in. I’ve given you a beacon stone for that, don’t lose it. Also I can’t keep this portal permanently open at all times. Besides the accused celestial energy that comes through with the portal open, the link is still very weak, so I’d suggest you not use the stone until you’re completely finished with whatever business you have in that place.”\n“Only business I have is making Sinthinia a bloody corpse when I find her.”\n“Well I hope you do it soon. Things are always a little more chaotic when you’re not around.”\n“I already spoke to Spol if that’s what you’re concerned about, but it might also help if you tried to actually keep your legs closed once in awhile.”\n“Apologies general. I really try, it’s just difficult to fight nature.”\n\nWhile you can’t disagree with that on some level, but you’re not going to let her off that easy and you suggest that she focus on her inventions. (And her task at hand of course)\n\nAs she prepares to reopen the portal, you are mildly glad that Zel is showing a lot of potential to be more than what she is. As far-fetched as it may seem in a place like this, it gives you hope that you’re actually changing things, even to a minor degree.\n\nThe portal opens and the wretched celestial light nearly blinds you, but your armor seems to be doing its job since you don’t feel anything except mild discomfort. No pain though. You’re wondering how Sin is even surviving, if the whole place is bathed in this.\n\nDetermined to bring back Sin’s head whether it’s just a burned skull or still attached to her living body, you step towards the portal…\n",
  "page 18": "You get the impression that whatever is going on here is probably some sort of trickery to throw you off the game so you leave rather than play and they won’t have to live up to their offer.\n\n“Nothing’s wrong. Go.” You say and play another card, ignoring the portal.\n\nAnother round is played and the next time you look where the portal was, it’s gone completely.\n\n“So we almost done playing this pointless game or am I wasting my fucking time?” you say.\n“We’ll play a few more games, you infernals are so impatient. No time for foreplay in hell I guess though eh?” Posil chuckles.\n\nAs you start another round, one of the angels sitting close begins leaning towards you.\n\n“So infernal, what’s it like in hell?” the angel asks.\n“What do you think it’s like?”\n“I dunno, never been there. I assume there’s a lot of fire with a red sky and torture.”\n“Sounds about right and sit back celestial.”\n“Is there a lot of rape?”\n“I’m sure it happens. Wouldn’t be hell if it didn’t.” You answer.\n“Has it ever happened to YOU?”\n“I said get back celestial.”\n“I bet it did, didn’t it?”\n“Last chance to get the fuck back ”\n“Hah! And what are YOU going to do about it infernal bitch?”\n“I’ll…what the fuck?!”\n\nYou are taken off guard when you look at the offending celestial directly and see his face as nothing but a gaping maw with rows teeth.\n\nNearly falling backwards in your chair, you manage to maintain your balance as you stand up and draw your sword.\n\nAll the celestials start smirking and chuckling, but they all look normal.\n\n“Again with the violence, I thought we were through all this, it doesn’t work here. So even if we were going to honor you by gang rape, we’d obviously need your permission first.” Posil snorts.\n“Wait, if we had her permission, doesn’t that mean it wouldn’t be rape anymore?” another angel asks.\n“Not the way I do it.” Another angel says with a laugh.\n\nThere’s no question about it now, SOMETHING else is going on here and these aren’t celestials. They aren’t just rebels or fallen either. You feel like something more has gone on with them or possibly they never were celestials and are just mimicking them.\n\nYou’ve also had enough of this mind fuckery that’s been going on since you got here.\n\nYou’re starting to get the impression that given you have no back up and no knowledge of what this strange place or its inhabitants are capable of you should just leave. Even if it isn’t ideal that you don’t have Sinthinia, you’ll just have to dispense justice at a more opportune time.\n\nAs you start to leave, Posil and the rest stand up.\n\n“Hey where are you going, I thought you wanted that succubus?” Posil asks.\n“I do, but I’m obviously wasting my time here with you degenerate assholes.” You remark.\n“Oh come on, I didn’t take you infernals as an overly sensitive bunch that got offended so easily. That’ll change though when we’re all united the old ones.”\n“What?”\n\nSuddenly Posil starts cursing, realizing he’s said something he shouldn’t have, the rest of the angels start looking at each other.\n\n“Knew you weren’t celestials.” You say and leave.\n\nYou haven’t gotten far, when Posil and the rest of his little gang follow you outside.\n\n“That’s right infernal, we aren’t celestials! We’re better! You’ll soon learn that! The whole cosmos will and when our time comes, it will be terrible and glorious!” Posil shouts.\n“If it involves more of your pontificating, it’ll definitely be terrible, I doubt it’ll be glorious though.” You answer without even looking back.\n\nBefore you can continue your exit out of town, Posil suddenly appears in front of you. He has a psychotic look on his face that mixes a maniacal smile and malevolence.\n\n“Oh, I’m going to walk under that infernal red sky with you.” He says.\n“You going to hold my hand too?” you answer with your sword still ready.\n\nBefore Posil can come up with another snappy retort. Engan materializes nearby. He doesn’t look pleased either.\n\n“Posilodja! What did I tell you?!” Engan questions.\n“I…” is all Posil\n“I don’t want to hear it! Go back to your post!”\n\nPosil doesn’t say anymore, he gives you one more scowling glance and flies off. You’re about to do likewise, but then Engan wants to speak to you.\n\n“I apologize for Posil and his friends’ behavior…” Engan says before you interrupt.\n“Save it Engan. I’ve already seen and heard enough to know this isn’t a place for me. I don’t even think it’s a place for you lot given the inkling of what it seems like it’s done to you. I’m going to guess wherever Sin is in this place, it probably is nowhere plesant, so I’ll just hope that she’s suffered at least as equal to what I would have done.”\n“You’ve got the wrong idea, and as I said, I can take you to her.”\n“Oh I bet you can, and then I’d bet I’d be trapped right along side her. So I’ll just be leaving.”\n\nFor a brief moment you see Engan’s shimmering silver skin, turn a dull gray and his face show an obvious sign of displeasure. However, he then hoovers away backwards a bit before speaking again.\n\n“Very well. Now is not your time, but it will be coming infernal. And when that time comes I hope you will be more open to the only truth that matters.”\n“Only thing that’s going to be open is your insides the next time I see any of you lot again and I guarantee there won’t be some no violence barrier in the infernal realm.”\n\nEngan says nothing to your last statement and disappears. You then make haste out of the town and back towards where you first came through the portal. You activate your beacon stone and enter the portal when it reappears.\n\nA brief brightness and then you’re back in Sinthinia’s old room. You never thought you’d feel more at ease here than you do right now.\n\nYou look around and see nobody. Zel isn’t even here at her machine that opened up the portal in the first place. Though you got a good idea of who she’s probably with and what’s she’s doing.\n\nNot long after your arrival, you immediately find the first soldiers you bump into and start giving out orders. There is much to do and the first thing you do is tell your troops to go fetch Zel as you have important work for her. You also tell them to bring Captain Spol to you. As even if in the off chance that he didn’t disobey your orders and stayed away from Zel, you still don’t feel comfortable with him lurking about. Your little trip has made you a little extra paranoid and you’re going to have to very prepared for what’s coming as you don’t think those were idle threats made by those corrupted celestials.\n\nThe Future…\n\n“I think we can set up a base on this world, General. From what we can tell, this world has a suitable magic level and even minor infernal connections. Looks like someone tried to influence it at one time and was either stopped or lost interest. I think with sufficient time and forces in place, you’ll be able to use the full extent of your powers.” Zeljenir says.\n“Hm, good. Send out the girls to seek out the mortals with power and any fringe cults that may exist.” You remark.\n“Understood. Am I to assist too?”\n“Not at this time, I want you to start setting up some basic defenses here. These sorts of old ruins are notorious for adventurers to stumble into and I’m not going to always have time to run around chopping their heads off immediately. Later we can probably enslave some competent lower life forms to serve.”\n“Understood General.” Zel says and leaves.\n\nYou look around at the newest place you’ve decided to call home and can’t believe it’s come to this. Hiding out on a mortal world after nearly being killed in your own realm.\n\nYou thought you would be prepared, and indeed you did prepare to the point of slowing down your conquest of the infernal realm and focusing more on defense. Though short of perhaps having trustworthy allies you don’t think you would have been able to withstand the onslaught that you faced against the abominations that came screaming out of the portals during the initial invasion.\n\nThe funny thing is they ALL seemed to focus on you first. Granted there were attacks elsewhere, but all their forces attacked your territory first. You can guess that your visit REALLY pissed off some of the more “individual” of the invasion force.\n\nYou had to face Posil, Engan, and Sinthinia (in her new changed form) all at some point. You nearly died in battle more than once, and about the only major victory you at least felt satisfaction about was utterly destroying that degenerate ex-celestial Posil and making sure he and his three closest cohorts were never coming back.\n\nStill, it was never enough and of course in typical infernal fashion your immediate neighbors did nothing to help, indeed they probably were filled with glee about your losses.\n\nShort sighted however, because when the invaders were finishing your last remnant holdings, they turned their attentions elsewhere at last. Your territory had become a staging ground for futher attacks on the infernal realm, which was already starting to be transformed before you escaped.\n\nEscaping to other parts of the infernal realm were futile, on top of the ancients seemingly sending hunters after you specifically, other infernal leaders never welcomed you into their lands. Unsurprising of course.\n\nWith nothing left and an ever-dwindling number of loyalists, you pondered making one last stand, but then you realized that would ultimately not prove anything and certainly not allow you to get revenge.\n\nYou made plans to escape to a mortal world and attempt to rebuild.\n\nThis of course would have problems as you would be no longer linked to your home realm’s power source, but there were ways around that thanks to Zel and her research.\n\nAnd now after several attempts, it will be THIS world where you will rebuild everything.\n\nThe average mortal inhabitants will be much weaker than even the lowliest of infernal, but that’s okay, they’ll be easier to mold. And if there’s anything you’re aware of, highly skilled mortals can defy even the greatest of odds. They’re annoying that way.\n\nAnd the irony of all this, a lot of this is reliant on several teams of succubi who tagged along with you during your escape. Why they followed you given your hostile attitude towards their kind is only a mild surprise. After all, they aren’t above degrading themselves for survival and their main powers aren’t much good against the chaotic abominations from beyond.\n\nBut they’re great against mortals. They’ll help build you an army. In time perhaps you’ll manage to transform this world into something more like home.\n\nYou never thought your plans would ever be reliant on the very hell whores you despise, but as they say, any port in the storm.\n\nAnd this is going to be a long storm, but you’ll ride it out.\n",
  "page 144": "Your mind goes back to the immediate aftermath of taking Nuro (Which was renamed Aftermath funny enough). That period was probably one of the more precarious times of your reign.\n\nOne difficult task was to train the demonologists who had stayed to become necromancers. That was unfortunately mostly up to you since Azrael had no patience for such things. In fact in the one time he participated in training, he killed one of the demonologists by accident and severely wounded two others. It was at that point you decided you needed to take over the task completely.\n\nIt took months, but it went quicker than expected mainly because all of them were much better wizards than Azrael was. (As far as learning was concerned at any rate) Hessan seemed to be the most competent so he was given the more important tasks within this new Dark Order. (Like training potential new necromancers later)\n\nRebuilding Aftermath was another major endeavor, but with the mixture of magic, tireless undead workers (and some submissive living ones) it also went quickly and the city was back to being what it was.\n\nWell, not exactly what it was, you made a lot of changes. Again, Azrael didn’t seem to care what you changed around. He seemed only concerned with things like what his throne looked like and how strong the walls were.\n\nThere was also fending off the immediate attacks by the Grand Alliance. That was actually the easiest problem to handle, since this is when Azrael would take full control and his focus was absolute. He really reveled in his necromantic powers. He was certainly good at it. If anything the Grand Alliance fools had only shored up your defenses by providing more troops for Azrael to raise from the dead.\n\nThere were even a few minor excursions outside the walls of the immediate city in that first year. A few of the larger towns were targeted, mainly to expand your army and deprive the Grand Alliance of nearby areas to supply and launch attacks from.\n\nYou even left the city for the first time to participate in this task since Azrael at this point was still reluctant to leave the city in charge of anyone else. Being outside the city wasn’t the most pleasant experience for you and that’s saying a lot considering the situations you’d been in.\n\nFrom the moment you left, you felt uncomfortable. Just the openness of it all felt unnatural to you and there were moments you had to calm yourself to prevent going into a panic.\n\nYou only really felt okay again when an attack on a town was underway. All the death seemed to calm you, but it still wasn’t the same. You needed to get back home as soon as possible.\n\nIt was after that first moment of being outside the city that you decided to make a place specifically for yourself and not just where you were living.\n\nYou went back to a place you hadn’t been to in years, the Nuro city park. It was of course much different now. Everything was dead, well mostly everything. Even in this new desolate environment there was life as scavengers and the like scurried about.\n\nYou turned the park into your own personal garden, a beautiful mixture of life and death. Black moss, death vines, withered trees, toxic mushrooms, and more.\n\nBy the time you were finished, you were very pleased with your personal project, but something still felt missing.\n\nAnd then you saw something, a pretty fluttering glowing insect land on a nearby corpse being used a flowerbed. A gravewing. Several of them in fact.\n\nNow it was truly home.\n",
  "page 8": "Within a blink of an eye, you’re on the other side, which strangely doesn’t have the heavenly aura you were expecting. It’s present to be sure, but it’s muted.\n\nUpon looking around your immediate surroundings you’re in a pretty desolate area. Nothing but gray rocks, gray ground and just… well gray in general. The sky is even a dull gray, reminds you of a cloudy day on one of those mortal worlds. Certainly isn’t the paradise you were expecting.\n\nThe only thing that stands out in the immediate area is a single dead gray tree nearby which will at least make a good landmark of where the portal is when you’re ready to leave.\n\nIn the distance, you see what looks to be a town of some sort. Since that seems to be the only major point of interest you make your towards it.\n\nYou haven’t gotten far when suddenly a winged being with shining silver skin appears before you. A celestial! You grab your sword.\n\n“Now, now, no need for that, my infernal friend. You’ll find that I am not hostile; in fact violence is utterly useless here. Strike me with your sword, if you don’t believe me.” it says.\n\nNever one to avoid the chance to engage in violence, you do exactly that and swing your sword directly at the celestial’s neck.\n\nAnd a blow that should have severed the smug smiling celestial’s head from his shoulders instead does nothing. Your sword just bounces off like you struck a rock.\n\nInstinctively you immediately attempt to use magic only to find that none of it is working.\n\n“I’m afraid you’ll find any harmful magic won’t work here either. Let alone from the likes of an infernal like yourself. Tried to tell that to the other one like you.” The celestial says.\n“Like me? You talking about the burned bitch that escaped to here, because that hell whore is NOTHING like me.” you reply pausing your attacks.\n“Well two infernals popped in here not long ago. One I am all too familiar with, while the… hell whore as you mentioned he dragged in, not so much. She was a bit of a mess as you said, but then the door to this place tends to keep you lot out, not that there would be much for you to be interested in to begin with, though given the brief tale Red told he mentioned that a very angry infernal might be visiting soon. Guessing that’s you since I can feel the hatred just emanating from you. You really should relax more.”\n“WHERE IS SHE?!”\n“She’s in town. I can certainly take you to her if you like, but I’m not sure what you intend on doing. As I said, violence of any kind doesn’t work here. Part of the punishment I suppose. Keeps us from killing ourselves or each other. Anyway I should introduce myself. My name is Engantrioso.”\n\nThis is all very strange and only serving to make you angrier, however it’s apparent that straightforward violence isn’t going to serve you right now unfortunately, so you might as well ask more questions.\n\n“So what is this place exactly?” you ask.\n“It’s a prison of sorts for celestials. The official name is Garceol, though most of us just call it the gray prison. Not very imaginative I know, but it is accurate.” Engan says.\n“A prison for celestials? Thought you lot just got cast into the infernal realm if you weren’t the agents of good that you claim to be.”\n“Well that does happen for serious offenders, those that are completely unrepentant in their wickedness. For most of us however, we do feel a remorse for our crimes, so this is where we stay until deemed fit to ascend back to our heavenly realm.”\n“This seems like a shitty prison for punishment.”\n“Well, I’m sure it would seem that way to you. You infernals love your spikes, whips and such for punishment, but I assure you, being disconnected from the celestial realm and the loss of our tie to the place is the worst punishment that we could ever experience. There is an emptiness that is indescribable. I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”\n“Hm. So what happens to others that wander in here?”\n“Doesn’t happen often. This place is insignificant enough that it doesn’t get many planewalkers stumbling in here. We tend to just treat them as temporary guests that are free to leave at anytime. Not many choose to stay as there isn’t anything in the way that would sustain them here and the more destructive bunch tend to get bored what without the ability to destroy or kill anything. Infernals are even rarer thanks to the way the portal here is set up, but seeing as some of you are determined enough, you’ll be treated with hospitality like any other guest here. We don’t expect you to be grateful of course, such is your nature.”\n“Glad to hear it because I’ll be living up to your expectations.”\n“Since I’m sort of the unofficial mayor of the town to use a mortal designation, did you need me to take you back to town and to your succubus? She’s currently staying at one of our unused homes. As I said though, not sure what you’ll be able to do to her though, violence doesn’t work here. You won’t even be able to punch her.”\n“Can I touch her at all?”\n“Well yes.”\n“Then I’ll just drag her ass out by force to the portal if need be.”\n“Hm, you might find that hard to do if she is unwilling to go with you, but I suppose having the pair of you here will break up the monotony. Come, I’ll take you to her.”\n\nYou’ve never actually been in the presence of many celestials, let alone this long without being in combat with them. The aura this one is giving off is really offending you however and that’s saying something given you live in hell. It isn’t like the celestial light either, which actually causes pain. There’s no pain, it’s just you don’t know how to describe it exactly.\n\nThen again, celestials and infernals aren’t supposed to be friends so you imagine this is normal. Engan probably feels something similar.\n",
  "page 147": "You take a deep breath, close your eyes and exhale.\n\nYou can do this.\n\nYou open your eyes.\n\nYou will do this.\n\nYou wave your hand and instantly the music stops as all the corpses cease their animation.\n\nYou aren’t going to enjoy it though. It’s just necessary.\n\nNow you contemplate about HOW you’re going to do it.\n\nYou half wonder if you shouldn’t recruit the rest of the Dark Order to help you, or at least some of them. The problem with this approach though is then you have to trust that lot to not turn on you before the ambush or even during or immediately after the ambush. There’s also the chance that they’ll just make things worse by bungling.\n\nIf you take out Azrael yourself, you’re fairly confident though that the rest of the Dark Order won’t oppose you since you will have proven yourself more powerful.\n\nThe problem with that is Azrael might not be the best wizard, but he’s really damn powerful at one type of magic and that’s more than enough. You aren’t sure you’d be able to take him in a one on one fight.\n\nIt occurs to you that you’re going to have to resort to trickery, but something that you know damn well he’s going to go fully into without thinking too hard about it.\n\nYou leave your garden and head to your bedroom first to prepare a few things and then go see Azrael, mentally preparing yourself for what you need to do.\n\nYou find Azrael going through one of Mr. Demar’s old necromantic tomes. When he sees you enter the room, he turns his attention completely to you.\n\n“Catalina. What’s going’s on? Has there been another Grand Alliance army spotted?” he asks.\n“No, I just want to speak to you about something.” You reply.\n“Look Cat, if this is about the Ghoul King alliance again, I really don’t want to fucking argue about that. It’s done and we’ll see what happens. As I said, Hessan is with him and I told him to end the blood sucker if there’s the slightest hint of betrayal.”\n“Yes, I’m sure that will all work out, that’s not what I wanted to talk to you about though. It’s about us.”\n“What about us?”\n\nAt this point you move around his desk and put your arms around him. You’re not exactly an expert at this whole “seduction” thing, but fortunately you don’t have to be in his case.\n\n“Well…this is friendlier than you usually are.” Azrael says.\n“I’ve been thinking lately I should be even friendlier. I think my hostility towards you has just been my way of being cautious. I don’t have the best experience with guys.” You remark.\n“Completely understandable, but as I’ve said I…”\n\nYou interrupt by kissing him.\n\n“No more talking.” You say and then drop to your knees. He’s surprised at first, but soon gets into it and falls back into his chair.\n\n\nWhile you have complete control over the situation, the problem is he’s still looking at you. It takes awhile, but eventually he gets to the point where his head has rolled back in ecstasy and that’s when you move your hands up to caress his chest.\n\nYou then slam your hands on his chest and using all your focus, you begin draining the life from his body. Azrael is completely unprepared for this and he doesn’t even react so much as he seizes up as his heart can’t take this direct necromantic energy you’re unleashing.\n\nAfter it’s all said and done, you’ve killed him by literally sucking (and swallowing) the life force out of him. A bit unconventional, but honestly a sexual encounter was the only way you were going to catch him off guard and you think if you’d actually gone all the way with regular sex, you might have gotten too intimate and backed out of the plan.\n\nEven now as you look upon Azrael’s corpse, you feel…weird. Not just because of how you killed him, but that you did at all.\n\nYou lean back on the desk, and start to tear up a bit. Then you allow yourself to cry altogether.\n\nWhy does this hurt so much when you weren’t even really together? Was there another way? Could you have had a relationship with him and it worked out?\n\nThose questions are all moot now because what’s done is done. You’ve chosen to live without any sort of potential weakness. Whatever happens now, your destiny is truly your own.\n\nAnd yet, your feelings aren’t going away. They won’t either, not immediately at least. You look at Azrael.\n\nHe’s still intact (If a little withered). You could still have him. It might even be better. He’d be yours and you wouldn’t have to worry about any sort of power struggle or anything else because you’d always be in control.\n\nHowever, you wonder if that’s really a good idea. Maybe you should just move on completely.\n",
  "page 146": "You’ve never been one to just go head first into battle without a plan of some sort, besides Maggie’s not the only one in there. Her husband might be at death’s door, but knowing how things can go to shit quickly, it would be just your luck that he recovers enough to help out his wife if you step in there.\n\nYou move over from the portion of wall you’re behind since you fully expect Maggie to bring it down, but then you hear someone say something and then the attacks stop.\n\nYou then see a bright light appear at the entryway to the room, and then hear movement in the portal room.\n\nYou cautiously approach the entryway and find that they’ve erected a magical barrier. David is still on the floor and Maggie has gone back to attempting to fix one of the portals to escape.\n\nYou don’t think you’d get through this barrier before Maggie can fix the portal, but you’ve got an idea.\n\nDavid’s dead. You can tell his life force has finally let go of his mortal shell. You don’t think Maggie’s even realized it yet since she’s focused on getting the portal working. It doesn’t matter though; it won’t change what you’re going to do.\n\nYou focus…\n\nMaggie says something about getting out of Nuro soon.\n\nDavid’s body sits up.\n\nMaggie turns around briefly and sees David sitting up. She tells him to just rest and to save his strength. She says she’s got everything under control before returning to work on the portal. She doesn’t realize David isn’t even alive anymore.\n\nDavid stands up and begins to walk towards Maggie. You begin your attempt of bringing down the barrier.\n\n“David, I said save your…David wha…BY THE GODS! NO!” you hear Maggie scream followed by nonsensical groans by David’s corpse.\n\nA physical scuffle ensues. You doubt if David’s corpse is going to kill her, but it’s enough of a distraction to give you time to get the barrier down.\n\nBy the time you get back in the room, Maggie has managed to dispatch her husband’s corpse, which is now beheaded. She stands before you with some sort of magic blade in her hand.\n\n“You evil bitch! I’m going to…argh…agh…” Maggie starts to clutch her belly and begins bleeding. Apparently the high stress and physical trauma of this whole situation has finally taken a toll on her condition. Her magic blade disappears, as her concentration is broken.\n\nShe falls to the floor in pain and you walk slowly over to her. She somehow manages to cast a few bolts at you, but you easily block them with a magic shield.\n\n“Your baby has joined your husband.” You say.\n“Fuck you! Fuck you!” Maggie cries.\n“This could have been easier for you all, but don’t worry. You’ll ALL be together soon.”\n\nYou focus…\n\nMaggie begins clutching her belly again as the pain becomes unbearable. She screams out as her dead child is dead no longer.\n\nThe result is gory and horrific as the undead half formed infant rips its mother’s insides up attempting to get out in a non-traditional way.\n\nMaggie’s screams become dying wails mixed with coughs of blood, she lives long enough to see the baby rip through her stomach. The undead abomination crawls out making unnatural growls.\n\n“Congratulations. It’s a boy.” You say and then walk away having accomplished your task.\n\nNow you can only hope that Mr. Demar and Azrael have accomplished their own goals.\n\nYou make your way back to the administration building, which looks even more destroyed than when you left it. However, you notice it’s the new library where you’re hearing the sounds of battle now. You aren’t sure how the battle transferred to there, but you imagine the huge hole in the side of the library has something to do with it.\n\nYou enter the library through the large hole and see the sight of two men throwing spells at each other. Amazing stamina for their age, but much to your dismay, Mr. Demar doesn’t look like he has the upper hand.\n\nYou see Mr. Demar struggling to block the dean’s attacks. He trips over a fallen bookshelf giving the dean time to hit him with several magic bolts before he can shield himself.\n\nFortunately the dean is so busy trying to kill Mr. Demar, he doesn’t see you at all and you set him on fire with a cone of flame to his back. The unexpected immolation causes him to scream and panic which considering he’s surrounded by books, the fire just spreads even more.\n\nHe soon collapses and you put out the fire with a strong gust of frosty wind. You hope that’s it, because you’re exhausted.\n\nYou go over to Mr. Demar who is struggling to get up, but he doesn’t look well. He’s bloody and burned severely. You help him up.\n\n“Thanks…ugh…I could’ve taken that bastard if…only been a little younger and…agh…” Mr. Demar says clutching his side.\n“Save your strength, he’s dead now. The battle’s been won.” You say.\n“You succeeded in your task then?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good. What about Azrael?”\n“I don’t know. Though I haven’t noticed any more temporal anomalies so maybe that’s a good sign.”\n“Maybe…help me over to that chair.”\n\nAs you assist Mr. Demar, you can’t help but look at him in a completely different light. You once respected this man a great deal, and if you’re being honest with yourself, you were even attracted to his skill in necromancy.\n\nBut now? You see nothing but a frail old man who made many mistakes in his pursuit to rule. Maybe his will was stronger than his body, which will soon be joining the way of all flesh.\n\nStill, there is always a beauty in that.\n\n“Catalina…” Mr. Demar says as he gets to the chair.\n“Yes?” you respond.\n“You could probably still get out of here and start a new life for yourself. I doubt if anyone would know who you are.”\n“Hm, perhaps. But Nuro has always been my home. The death and destruction on a grand scale has now made it seem even more like home. This is where I belong.”\n“You’re a strange girl Cat…so do you intend on taking over the Dark Order?”\n“Mr. Demar, we could still heal your wounds.”\n“No. That’s only going to prolong the inevitable. My plan didn’t go as planned and I’m tired. Very tired. I just don’t have the motivation or energy to go on. Listen, if you intend on staying, then you will need to take over what remains of the Dark Order. You’re the most skilled wizard in it.”\n“What about Azrael? He’s become quite… shall I say confident in the couple times I’ve seen him during the battle.”\n“Ah yes, the savant. Well if he lives, then I’d advise that you use him as a powerful weapon and point him in the direction of your enemies. If his power is growing the way it seems to be, I believe he will be a bigger target. Sometimes you can run things without being the leader. Maybe that’s what I should have done.”\n“What makes you think he’ll listen to me?”\n\nMr. Demar laughs.\n\n“You’re joking right? The boy obviously has passion for you and I don’t think it’s just physical. Azrael, Trelik, Sebastian, you really are a heart breaker aren’t you? Strange that you don’t age like most necromancers of your power. Even as young as you are, you would start displaying the signs like gray or white hair, wrinkles and such. Potentially looking like someone at least five years or a decade older. You using magic to hide your true appearance? Trelik did that, I’m sure so did Irwin.”\n“No. Never occurred to me.”\n“Hm, interesting. Wonder if it’s due to your affinity to nature magic, or maybe you’re just lucky…agh… I’m just going to rest here a moment. You should start securing what remains of the city. If you see Azrael though, send him to me. Hopefully I’ll be around to speak to him one last time.”\n\nYou nod and begin to take your leave.\n\n“Goodbye Catalina. I hope your desires, whatever they may ultimately be come true. And you were right. We did win.” You hear Mr. Demar say.\n\nYou exit the library wondering what your next move should be. You see a couple of figures dressed in red robes approaching you. They’re demonologists. You’re not sure if you should be glad to see some of them survived, you suppose you’ll see if they attack or not.\n\n“Hey! You’re that necromancer girl, Catalina right?” one of them asks.\n“Yes. Can’t say I remember either of you though.” You respond.\n“Oh my name is Hessan and this is Belial. Is that other necromancer still alive? I ran into him earlier after he wiped out Nuro’s remaining security. Azzy or something.”\n“Azrael. And I don’t know yet, but I imagine he’ll pop up. So what’s with all the questions and do you have any info on the status of the rest of the city?”\n\nHessan goes into some detail of what the situation with the rest of the city as well surviving members of the Dark Order. He mentions that most of the demonologists still alive are ready to switch over to necromancy since it seems more reliable than summoning demons. (Including himself)\n\nAll of this is good news since you weren’t exactly thrilled with the idea of having demonologists in the Dark Order given their spectacular failure during this battle. You tell Belial that he should find the rest of his fellow demonologists and tell them to come back to the university immediately so defenses can be prepared.\n\nAfter Belial leaves, you continue speaking with Hessan who goes on to say that the city is half destroyed, but all resistance is gone. You thank him for the information and tell him to go help Belial. You then suddenly sense a strong aura of death approaching.\n\nYou turn your head and see Azrael with a small horde of dead behind him. He survived just like you figured.\n\n“Huh, took you long enough. You missed all the major battle while you were playing around with Quayle.” You say.\n“Playing around? You don’t even want to know what I’ve been through, and I’ll wager it wasn’t nearly as…disturbing as what you went through.” Azrael replies.\n“Doubt it, by the time I got here Mr. Demar had already lost Felsa, Trelik had betrayed him, and Sebastian was killed. Luckily I was here to provide back up for the final battle with the Dean. We’ve won, but Mr. Demar is very weak right now, I dunno if he’s going to survive his wounds.”\n“Shit, sounds like I did miss a lot, so is Trelik dead?”\n“Nope, the coward ran off when he realized he couldn’t beat Mr. Demar.”\n“Can I see him?”\n“Sure I guess, he’s in library, or what’s left of it.”\n\nYou watch Azrael enter the library after commanding his dead to stay put. Your mind begins forming plans and ideas of what you’re going to do next. It’s almost a bit overwhelming.\n\nBut somehow you feel confident that one of the biggest obstacles has been overcome. You now have a home where you can do whatever you want. There is no limitation or hiding any longer. You can truly appreciate the beauty of death as it is all around you now.\n\nYou know you’re going to have to defend your home, but when haven’t you had to fight against those that would try to limit you? This will be no different and you aren’t going to shy away from the challenge.\n\nEventually you see Azrael come back out of the library.\n\n“So what’s going on?” you ask.\n“I’m in charge, that’s what’s going on.” Azrael replies.\n\nYou’re still a little surprised by how blunt Azrael’s gotten about his ambition, but that surprise is disappearing much quicker now. He’s definitely going to be a useful weapon in the struggles to come. You’ll just need to guide him a bit.\n\n“Well, I suppose we could do worse…so what’s next fearless leader?”\n“Good question.”\n\nWell maybe a lot.\n",
  "page 2": "1 TR (Time of Reaping)\n\n“Mistress, there’s been reports of holes opening up in the skies over Evigrus and ethereal beings pouring out. Reports of the dead rising on a mass scale have also been confirmed.” Pivik remarks.\n\nYou smack your young subordinate across the face twice. To his credit he doesn’t flinch, though he’s probably used to it lately.\n\nYou kick Pivik in the balls, dropping him to his knees to get some sort of desired pain reaction, after feeling a minor sense of accomplishment; you then turn your attention to the rest of your “closest” lieutenants.\n\n“Why the fuck did you lot let this happen!? Didn’t I tell you he would doom us all with that book?!” you exclaim.\n“US?! I suggested a full-scale assault on Evigrus and you dismissed that idea as foolish claiming that stealth would be more effective. We sent tons of assassins and they never even got close to killing him, if they ever reached him at all!” Gikil protests.\n“Shit, I even went personally with my best agents and barely made it off Evigrus alive!” Belina adds.\n“Yeah! And YOU were the one playing weird games with him over the years rather than just killing him immediately! Several times you HAD the opportunity, but did you take it? No, you were too busy indulging in your disgusting monkey lusting habits.” Drunni says.\n\nIt’s been like this more and more lately, your lessers not knowing their place. You haven’t decided if you’re going to kill any of them yet, but you’ll soon know after this meeting.\n\n“Gikil, your invasion plan was idiotic at best and suicidal at worst. Even if we had managed to motivate every svelk for such a cause, we would have been severely out numbered. Belina, you failed because you’re a mediocre assassin. And Drunni, I’m going to just ignore your comment since you haven’t had anything of worth to contribute to the last five meetings we’ve had so I’ll chalk this up to your exercise in being pathetically consistent and predictable.”\n\nYour lieutenants look at each other and scowl a bit but say nothing more.\n\n“You all are correct in holding your tongues because if you hadn’t I’d be holding them right now. Speaking of tongues Pivik, you can put yours to better use. Don’t get up, you’re good right there on your knees.”\n\nPivik being a little newer to the group isn’t exactly sure what you mean until you stand right in front of him. You then strip off the lower half of your clothing and look down upon him.\n\n“Better give head better than you give news.” You say and push his head into your crotch.\n\nYou feel his tongue going to work as you hold his head in place where you want it and continue your meeting.\n\n“Yeah, just like that.”\n\nGilik doesn’t bat an eye, Belina rolls her eyes, but they’re used to you multitasking like this during meetings. Drunni on the other hand show signs of obvious distaste. He’s never gotten used to it and it makes you smile that you’re able to cause the prudish asshole discomfort with such minimal effort.\n\n“Now that you idiots have allowed the unthinkable happen, we have to act quickly. Gilik since about the only thing you’re mildly good at is direct force and similar matters, I want you to start preparing the defenses of Dokkrus, start burning the dead as soon as someone dies, and obviously keep an eye on any cemeteries. Think you can handle that?” you order.\n“Yes Mistress.”\n“Good, now Belina I want you to take your best agents and head back to Evigrus…”\n“I just told you all my best agents are dead!” Belina interrupts.\n“Don’t (Mm, yeah right there) interrupt. In any case, just take your next best ones, I don’t know, whoever is just barely less competent than you. In any case your mission won’t be to assassinate the little emperor anyway. He’s arguably the only thing competent there that will be able to fight off the threat and buy valuable time. You’ll just be giving reports on the continent and what he’s doing. I’m sure you and your lot will be able to handle that.”\n“…yes Mistress.” Belina says with resignation.\n\nYou turn your attention to Drunni who has been the most insubordinate of the three. He keeps his eyes at your face, though occasionally looks away when he sees you smile while feeling a particularly good lick by Pivik. You give a small chuckle before addressing Drunni.\n\n“Drunni, I trust you still haven’t taken care of our less unified brethren given that I’m still getting reports of skirmishes on the southern side of the continent. I also trust that the main one that’s leading the majority of those short sighted fools is Kessla.”\n“It is, and as I’ve already said many times she’s entrenched herself in an underground fortress reinforced with dero rock. Magic won’t work on it.” Drunni answers.\n“Yes, I’m aware of that too, hence why I haven’t just teleported in and cut her heart out. (Damn, yeah…don’t stop) So since you’ve been a dismal failure in killing her, maybe you can do a better job of making her see reason during this time of great crisis.”\n“And how the hell am I supposed to do that after we’ve been trying to kill her for the past few years?”\n“Well weren’t you two fucking before the defense of Mortos five years ago? Try diplomacy. Rekindle old flames, bend her over and give her a good fucking while convincing her that Dokkrus needs to be completely united against this global threat.”\n“You’re asking the impossible! The whole failure at Mortos is why she broke away from this alliance in the first place because she blamed you for it.”\n“And I can’t help that she has wrong ideas on top of being a stubborn cunt. My point is, if we had the time to fuck about with massacring her following and retaking the southern part of the continent by force, I’d be willing to be patient, but unfortunately we don’t have that luxury. We cut off the head though and the rest will probably fall in line like sheep. So if you can’t convince her to stop her shit, then at least trick her long enough to slit her throat while you’re fucking her from behind. Just get it fucking done… AH FUCK!”\n\nYou close your eyes and grab your young assistant’s head as he turns out to be the only one that’s pleasing you at this moment. You actually crumple to your knees forcing him to lie back on the floor while he continues servicing you.\n\n“Out! All of you now!” you command and you hear the sounds of feet running quickly and then the slamming of the door.\n\nNow you’re alone with your thoughts. You’re not here; you’re in a different place. A better place.\n\n“Oh yes, do it. Do it Francis. Do it how mommy likes. I know how much you love me…it’s okay I know…I know…”\n\nYou feel a great release and then caress Francis’ head; you look down at his face and see such potential. Backing up a bit to give him air, you straddle his chest. You raise his head up with one hand and you bend forward a bit.\n\n“Did I do well Mistress?” he asks.\n“Yes, yes you did my beautiful boy and now I’m going to give you something…” You whisper kissing his forehead.\n\nYou then pull a dagger from a sheath strapped to your back and thrust it into Francis’ throat. His eyes go from showing utter devotion to shock, but even in death he does not struggle. He accepts his fate as he bleeds out.\n\n“Remember this...” You say standing up with the bloody dagger in your hand.\nYou blink a few times and look around and then at the floor where Pivik’s body lies.\n\n“Hm, different place…different place…” You say to yourself putting the rest of your clothing back on.\n\nYou look at Pivik’s body for a moment and set it on fire just in case.\n\n“Different place. Something to consider if possible.” You say leaving Pivik to burn in the middle of the stone floor.\n",
  "page 149": "No. He’s dead and while there’s beauty in that, it’s different. It wouldn’t be the same and holding on to something that you were trying to avoid in the first place wouldn’t really be the mentally healthiest thing to do.\n\nYou’ll burn his body yourself privately. He deserves that much.\n\nAfter some preparation and moving the body, you nearly kiss Azrael goodbye on the lips, but again you’re afraid that you’ll end up keeping him around. Instead you give him a quick peck on the cheek.\n\n“Goodbye Azrael. Maybe in another life.” You say and proceed to burn his body until it’s nothing but ashes.\n\nIt’s done. Now you have to pick up the pieces.\n\nThe first thing on the agenda is gathering members of the Dark Order and establish who is in charge now.\n\nYour announcement is met with surprise. Nobody opposes your rule for various reasons. Most of them due to figuring if you took out Azrael, then you must be even more powerful and they aren’t in any hurry to challenge you. (You naturally left out the exact details of how you managed it) The other minor reason is you did train most of them and you were in the Dark Order a lot longer than Azrael, so they’re a little more comfortable around you anyway.\n\nWith the new hierarchy in place, your next problem is a bit more dire. When you killed Azrael, you lost more than half of your undead army. You didn’t really realize just how much necromantic power he was using to upkeep it. In fact Dark Order some members were running around trying to figure out what happened since they saw whole platoons suddenly just collapse.\n\nYou still have enough of an army to defend Aftermath, but Azrael’s plans of expanding aren’t going to be happening anytime soon. Not that you had any major desire to expand since that was more his idea than yours.\n\nYou also send Belial to check on Hessan who is stationed in the Drozz wasteland. (And still unaware of everything) You’re still not exactly keen on the alliance that Azrael set up with the Ghoul King, but since it’s already in motion, you might as well see what the arrangement change might be now that Azrael is dead.\n\nA week later, Hessan return a little on the ragged side. Apparently with Azrael dead, the Ghoul King lost faith in the idea of an alliance with the Dark Order if its leader could be killed and replaced so easily.\n\nHe decided to play a little game Hessan and Belial of allowing them to live if they could make it out of his territory (Which was much bigger now thanks to slaughtering several tribes) before his ghouls catch and kill them. Only Hessan made it out.\n\nWith the Ghoul King’s new found power and confidence, he becomes yet another independent faction. The only good thing about this is it’s probably going to be more of a potential target for the Grand Alliance or even the Vampire clans.\n\nYou decide your best course of action is to just focus on defense for now.\n\nThree years pass and it’s all been a blur of the events that have happened.\n\nThe main issues have been a few vampire assassination attacks, which while you’ve managed to fend off; you’ve lost a vital number of necromancers in the process. In fact, the last attack seemed focused more on them than you. Whittling you down little by little, hoping to weaken your position.\n\nAnd it’s certainly having that effect because you just barely managed to beat back the last Grand Alliance attack.\n\nThe only upside is the Grand Alliance has been distracted between you, Velzix, Trelik and even the Ghoul King (Though he’s of a more minor concern due to mostly staying in the Drozz Wasteland)\n\nStill, last you heard Trelik isn’t going to last much longer. In desperation he sent a message to you practically begging for an alliance. Even apologized for his actions from before. Hard to believe given how proud you knew him to be, things must be very grim for him.\n\nAs bad as things are for you, you aren’t going to ally with Trelik. Even if he’s being sincere, his earlier betrayal has not been forgotten. (Not to mention that you never liked him in the first place)\n\nStill, you don’t have the highest hopes of fending off another focused Grand Alliance attack.\n\nTwo more years pass and you find that your predictions aren’t quite correct though the result is somewhat the same.\n\nAftemath is besieged, but instead it’s by the Ghoul King and hundreds of his ghouls swarming the walls. This in itself would be managable, but you’re also attacked by vampire assassins who as usual target the last of your remaining necromancers first. This immediately collapses most of your defenses allowing for the ghouls to overrun the place.\n\nLast you heard the Ghouls King was supposed to be on the outs with the Vampire Clans, but it looks like they came to some sort of understanding. Doesn’t matter because ultimately you’re confronted by several assassins and ghouls running around everywhere.\n\nYou manage to hold your own for a while, but the last thing you feel is a sharp pain to your back with an arm suddenly going around your head. Then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nYou know this didn’t happen. In fact you’re almost distressed by this experience, not due to dying as you’ve been there before, but the fact that you killed your beloved.\n\nIt almost seems impossible that such a scenario could have happened. However, everyone has those dark thoughts even towards those they love and there was a very brief time when you did ponder the possibility.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 1": "“Shit. She’s broken through the inner defenses! Go! Go fucking make yourselves useful and fucking stop her!” Sinthinia ordered to her last remaining elite grunts.\n\nAs her remaining lackeys probably went to their deaths, Sinthinia shook her head at the situation and couldn’t believe it had come to this. There was nowhere run either as there was a teleportation dampening field surrounding her palace. Sinthinia began to seriously panic for the first time in a long time.\n\n“This is worse than when I followed that fool Velzix.” She muttered to herself.\n“Indeed. I warned you about that too, but as usual, you didn’t listen. You were fortunate that I got you out of there when I did.”\n\nSinthinia turned around and saw her sometimes “ally” if such a word has meaning in Hell.\n\nBig Red stood before her in the room. Despite his nickname (Which he only goes by now), he wasn’t particularly big. In fact he was very average looking by demonic standards.\n\nHowever those who knew him knew very well he was far from average.\n\n“Red. How did you get in…nevermind, I know you always got a fucking loophole or escape route. So what did you want? You come to gloat?” Sinthina remarked.\n“Not really my style, I would have thought you would have known that during our time together.” Big Red remarked.\n“So what then? You here to help? Good luck, because I don’t think you’re tough enough to beat her in combat and I know that bitch out there isn’t listening to deals.”\n“Hm, probably not right now she isn’t. She does seem very determined to kill you. Guessing any deals you might have for her won’t help either.”\n“Pfft. I’d have better luck trying to seduce a celestial in the form of a little boy. In fact, I know I’d have better luck since I’ve done that before. This fucking cunt is so inflexible and frigid, she’s probably got frozen spider webs in her crotch.”\n“Well can’t be any worse than what you got living down there.”\n“Fuck you Red.”\n“Now is not the time to be making more enemies.”\n“So are you here to help or what? Because if you aren’t, then at least just fucking kill me now to deprive that bitch the pleasure of it.”\n“I haven’t decided yet. I’m still a little disappointed by your betrayal. You broke a contract and I can’t just forget that.”\n“Have you forgotten who we are? WE’RE FUCKING DEMONS! Betrayal is sort of what we do. And I didn’t break shit, I figured out a loophole and YOU just don’t like it because you consider yourself some sort of expert on such things.”\n“Heh, well I suppose from a certain point of view that’s true. Still, as you pointed out, we are demons. Proud beings and all.”\n“Oh so your pride is wounded? Fine. Get me out of here and I’ll suck your stubby spikey cock right fucking now, swallow your burning load and let you do whatever the hell you want sexually with me in the foreseeable future. Fuck, I’ll even muster up the enthusiasm to enjoy it.”\n\nBig Red shook his head and chuckled.\n\n“Oh you succubi, no matter how high your position, that’s always what it comes down to with you lot isn’t it? Trust me Sin, you weren’t nearly as good as you think you were in the first place. I dunno, I guess some of it was fun, but I just don’t see a major benefit in it for me to help you though.”\n“Wait! Come on! You can’t be okay with all this that’s been going on in Hell lately! I mean this fucking cunt is starting to change things with her actions and more and more seem to be fine with it! I mean what the fuck is going on? I remember a time when anarchy and chaos reigned supreme here!\n“While I don’t think it’s quite as bad as you’re saying, she is starting to make an impact in the short amount of time she’s been around. I admit I haven’t kept up on her as I probably should have, but I’ve been dealing more in the mortal realms lately. She’s had an impact on a few of those too though, which is partly why I’m here now I suppose. Her actions have indirectly interrupted a few of my deals I had in the works.”\n“So come on and take me with you, I can fill you in on all her strengths and weaknesses.”\n“Right, because you’ve obviously got a handle on those seeing as your personal palace is about to be overrun by her legions. Look, I suppose there is a place I could take you to safety, but there’s weird rules there and honestly I got other shit to do, so…”\n\nBefore Sinthinia could finish her sentence, a crash on her solid brass door was heard.\n\n“I think someone’s knocking Sin, see you around…maybe.” Big Red said with a wave before disappearing.\n“RED YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!” Sinthinia shouted as the door continued to be battered. It wouldn’t be long now.\n\nSinthinia readied herself for the onslaught that was to come. She might have even prayed for divine help if she wasn’t the godless creature that she was.\n\nOne last crash and the large brass doors swung open. Sinthinia expected several soldiers to come rushing at her, but it was just a single being.\n\nIt was just you, because of course it was.\n\nThis is it.\n",
  "page 148": "There’s more than a few practical reasons not to kill Azrael besides your personal ones.\n\nYou quickly dismiss your fleeting thought of murder. You’re going to take a wait and see approach and actually trust that he knows what he’s doing sometimes. It’s a risk, but then this whole situation is.\n\nRight now the situation is seemingly under control, so now you’re going to enjoy relaxing in your garden listening to your music and watching the gravewings flutter about.\n\nA few months pass and Azrael receives a letter via bat from the Ghoul King saying that it’s important. Azrael takes his leave and entrusts you to take charge while he’s away. (Not that you don’t even while he is here anyway)\n\nAzrael is gone for a week and then you expect him to be back. But he doesn’t come back. When it starts approaching a second week, you begin to get genuinely concerned. On top of Azrael not having come back yet, the Grand Alliance recently took back the Brot Kingdom from Trelik and it’s very likely they’re going to attack you next.\n\nYou send someone to the Drozz Wasteland to find out what’s happened and boost the defenses at Aftermath telling everyone to be ready for a potential attack.\n\nA few days later and you get word about the Brot Kingdom being attacked by a horde of undead giants. Apparently Brot has been overrun and the Grand Alliance has lost control of it. There was also only one necromancer seen in the chaos and the descriptions fit Azrael.\n\nThat asshole went and attacked Brot without any back up or even telling you! That was very foolish of him to besiege entire fucking kingdom without any extra help even if it was in a very weakened state.\n\nIf he survives, you’re going to definitely have some words with him.\n\nEventually Azrael returns victorious and you head out to meet him.\n\n“What the hell did you think you were doing risking your life like that? You should’ve come back to Aftermath for more soldiers before taking on the Brot Kingdom AND the Grand Alliance all by yourself!” you scold.\n“Why? Were you worried about me?” Azrael smiles smugly.\n\nYou hate to admit such a thing especially with that smirk all over his fce.\n\n“Well… um…no! But, you should’ve told me!”\n“I did tell you. I told you I had everything worked out and look…I did.” Azrael says putting his arm around you.\n\nAnd that’s it. You don’t push him away or slap him. You’re not even resisting anymore.\n\nHis ever-growing necromantic aura combined with what you know his feelings to be for you combined with your own feelings and well…it just doesn’t make sense to keep denying what’s staring you in the face. You’re accepting Azrael as your mate and wherever that may eventually lead.\n\nAnd he better not disappoint you.\n",
  "page 4": "“Cistagonija, I was wondering when you’d finally stop serenading me with the screams of my minions and just enter my bedroom. See? It’s all prepped for us. You were always welcome you know. I like a lady in armor. It’s the right blend of masculine femininity. You’re making me wet just standing there like that.” Sinthinia remarks pointing to her very fancy comfortable looking bed.\n\nWithout a word, you raise a hand unleashing a blue beam of magic and disintegrate it.\n\n“I see. Well we could always do it on the floor if you prefer.” Sinthinia remarks hopefully.\n“The only thing you’re going to be doing on the floor is dying.” You reply.\n“Fine. But know this Cista, you’re on the losing side of this war!”\n“Really? Because recent events show otherwise.”\n“Hah, short sighted bitch! All of this has only been a minor battle in the larger scope of a war you can’t begin to comprehend! The infernal realm will NEVER submit to your perverted desires of order!”\n“Peverted? Amusing words coming from one of the biggest succubus whores known in hell.”\n“I am TRUE to my nature. YOU on the other hand are an abomination that should have NEVER been allowed to survive this long! Time to correct that mistake!”\n\nSinthinia unleashes a spell blast, which your armor easily shrugs off. You don’t even know why she’s bothering. She’s no warrior, she’s a whore and the only things whores are good at are opening their holes.\n\nTime you made more of those in her; you continue to advance with your flaming sword in hand. You’re really going to enjoy widening this infernal harlot’s diseased slit to her equally diseased throat.\n\nYou can sense the fear in her. She puts up a pitiful force field that isn’t going to protect her for long. You know she’d beg you to spare her if she thought it would do any good.\n\nJust when you’re about to break the field, a blinding light engulfs the room and a portal appears behind Sinthinia! You took measures to ensure such a thing was impossible so she couldn’t escape, though looking back over at Sinthinia, she looks as confused as you are, though she also looks like she’s experiencing pain from the light emanating from the portal.\n\nThe light from the portal is actually causing you a minor bit of pain as well and your eyes are still having a difficult time adjusting to looking at it head on. You’re also feeling a powerful force holding you back.\n\n“Come into the light Sin! Hah, I’ve always wanted to say that.” You hear a voice chuckle from the portal.\n“Red? What is this? Argh! I’m fucking burning!” Sinthinia remarks.\n“It’s your best chance at a rescue so quit your bitching and take my hand, this holy light won’t bother you for long and it isn’t going to hold back your friend for long either.”\n\nRed or “Big Red” is certainly an infernal you’ve heard tales about, but you’ve never actually had any direct conflict or interaction with him. Looks like that’s about to change if he’s insisting on getting in your way.\n\nYou can barely see him within the glow of the light, but he’s completely covered in some sort of white armor and wearing goggles, which presumably is what is protecting him from this obvious holy light.\n\nSinthinia looks over to you and wastes no time in grabbing Red’s gauntlet. She’d rather burn than face you, though if the roles were reversed, you might pick the same choice.\n\nYou push forward with some difficulty and see Sinthinia’s burning ass (literally) run into the portal behind Big Red who is now addressing you.\n\n“Hm you ARE a powerful one. Maybe Sin is right and you are an actual threat to the infernal realm. I’ll definitely have to keep a closer eye on you in the future. However, I’d advise you NOT to follow for even as powerful as you are, I don’t believe you’re prepared. Don’t worry though, I’m sure you’ll get another chance to kill Sin assuming she even survives this trip of course.”\n\nWith those last words, Red steps back into the portal, which is now beginning to flicker and the holy light isn’t as powerful anymore.\n\nYou could easily run into the portal now, but you have no idea where it is going to take you. The fact that holy light was coming from it doesn’t seem like it’s heading any place you’d enjoy. Not that you ever enjoy anything other than perhaps utterly destroying your enemies which are becoming more and more numerous nowadays.\n\nOf course this also leads to more questions of the situation between Red and Sin since he didn’t exactly imply good things for her either. You suppose it’s possible he’s just robbed you of your kill and her fate is sealed anyway.\n\nWhile this is going through you head, the portal is beginning to disappear.\n\nCompletely abandoning any sort of caution, you run towards the portal, which then disappears.\n\n“Fuck!” you shout and punch a hole in the nearby wall, destroying enough of it to create a new window in Sin’s former palace.\n\nWhile your cursing your hesitation, a familiar voice is heard. It’s your chief engineer.\n\n“Um, mistress?” Zeljenir utters.\n“WHAT? And I told you not to fucking call me that! Only whores are mistresses! You will address me by my proper military title, do you understand?” you reply.\n“Yes general.”\n\nWhile you know she understands and you can sense the fear, you just don’t feel properly satisfied with this compliance.\n\nYou immediately walk over to Zel who just looks on in fear and offers no resistance. You grab her by her neck and slam her against the wall. You look at her with disgust as she continues to display her body like the infernal seductress she really is.\n\n“I don’t think you do. Address me other than general again and I will cast you down from your privileged position to the deepest darkest pit of degenerates in Hell and I guarantee you will NOT enjoy it. Am I making myself clear?” you threaten.\n“Yes general. I will obey!” Zel chokes.\n\nGood, that’s the proper amount of respect and fear. You release Zel and ask her why the hell she’s here since it isn’t like her to be anywhere near the frontlines. You certainly don’t keep her around for her fighting abilities. Her mind for engineering is what is important. She’s been very useful in designing siege weapons and such.\n\n“I’m here because you told me to let you know directly if I had any major problems with other members on your staff.” Zel remarks\n“You came all the way here now to tell me this?” you say.\n“Well I didn’t intend to, but…well during the siege when I was overseeing the juggernauts, Captain Spolnapad and some of his men…”\n“Oh for fuck’s sake, I fucking warned him about this and in the middle of the damn battle? No wonder the east side of the wall wasn’t brought down when I predicted it to be! Fucking chaos. So did they get you?”\n\nZel looks down.\n\n“I didn’t enjoy it I swear.”\n\nZel looks up at you and feels your judgmental stare to tell the complete truth.\n\n“Well I mean maybe a little at first, then I tried to stop them, but they wouldn’t stop and I barely escaped! I beg forgiveness general.”\n\nYou shake your head. You can’t even be too mad at her for this. She’s another succubus and the whore within her is always there, but fortunately you caught her when she was relatively new to the infernal plane and can be molded. She’ll change completely in time. Change is always possible.\n\nBut it’s not easy when you’re dealing with rapey lustful demons.\n\n“Fine. I’ll take care of it. But from now on, YOU need to start fucking covering up! You may have the body of a harlot, but you weren’t given this position because of your dick sucking skills. You were given this honor because of your skills as an engineer. I don’t want to see you running around fucking naked. Those days are long over! I will see you in a uniform from now on!”\n“We have uniforms?”\n“No, it’s a figure of fucking speech. What I’m saying is cover the fuck up. I don’t give a shit what you’re actually wearing as long as you don’t have all your fun bits exposed all over the place!”\n“Yes general.”\n\nWith that out of the way, Zel proceeds to give you an updated report of what’s been going on outside the palace. All your forces have of course completely destroyed Sin’s remaining minions. It’s a victory, but not really since Sin escaped. You’re still pissed about that then you remember that Zel has helped in forcing open portal to the mortal realm at times, you wonder if she could do that with this after explaining the recent situation.\n\n“Hm, that explains that faint smell of celestial in this room. Yeah there’s enough residual energy to do it, but we’d have to be quick before is disappears. I’ll need to get all the equipment in here.” Zel remarks.\n“That’s no problem. Go get all your machines and shit. If you need help, let whatever grunts you need that it’s a direct order from me to help you move it.” You say.\n\nWhile you’re expecting Zel to move, she hesitates.\n\n“You better have a good reason for not flapping those little wings and moving your ass as fast as possible right now.” You say.\n“It’s just…” Zel begins to say before trailing off.\n“Just what? What?! Pretend you’ve just sucked dick for three hours and spit it out already!”\n“I’d be a little concerned about you going.”\n“Concern? This should be good. What do you mean?”\n“Well from the description you gave it sounds like the place is filled with celestials or at least aligned with such powers. I mean the portal gave off enough of the energy that it’s still lingering even in this place. In fact, I’m not sure how Sin is going to survive being in such a place. I’d say you’d be better off focusing your attention on other matters. I mean your presence is needed to maintain order. If you disappear to who knows where for who knows how long, chaos could break out and I know you don’t want that.”\n\nYou smirk a bit at Zel’s transparent “concern.” She has it all right, but it’s more for herself. She’s mainly concerned about her position if you suddenly got killed or something similar.\n\nShe does enjoy the perks of having some of your protection, without it she’d probably be some demon lord’s fuck toy because even as far as succubi go, she’s still young and not nearly as hardened as she needs to be for the infernal realm.\n\nStill, even if she’s worried more about herself, you admit there is a certain element of unknown danger involved. Indeed, you hesitated before your late rush to the portal. Zel may also have a point not just about the danger to you, but also the potential for having to clean up a massive amount of shit if you’re gone for too long.\n\nAfter all, even when you’re around you STILL have to clean up shit. (Like the mess with Zel and Spol you’ll have to address for example) The burdens of being in charge you suppose.\n",
  "page 3": "You glide across the ethereal landscape passing several other spirits as you have countless times before.\n\nYou remember when you first arrived here; you would attempt to interact with them. Most of them ignored you, though some of the “younger” ones did, eagerly asking questions and exchanging information. It was fascinating.\n\nOf course as time passed you became much like those “older” spirits. Not wishing to interact with others and just peacefully drift in this place.\n\nTime of course is a funny term to use since you’ve pretty much lost all concept of it. You honestly can’t remember how much time has passed since you first arrived here. Still, it’s the best term to use for the lack of a better one.\n\nYou do have memories.

Your memories of your beloved still tend to be the strongest. You did spend most of your life with him after all. You still miss him even in this place.\n\nWhile some spirits eventually fade away even in this place of “final death”, your tie to him will always keep you waiting until he joins you again. Even if that won’t be for a very long time.\n\nHowever, it was the first time you managed to piece together your memories that you discovered completely by chance that you could still contact him. It’s no easy task though. Sifting through memories half faded by time is always something that requires focus because you’re essentially reliving those moments all over again as if they were real.\n\nAnd it isn’t always simple to focus when you’ve got new spirits suddenly asking you silly questions. (Just like you once did)\n\nWhether you’re successful or fail, there’s always a “down” period that you have to wait for before you can try it again. It’s a kind of magic you suppose. You’re not exactly sure how it works.\n\nWhat you do know is it’s time to try again.\n\nYou find a relatively isolated area away from any other spirits to lessen the chances of being disturbed and begin to focus…\n",
  "page 11": "You’ve had enough of this strange place; everything feels “off” anyway and you don’t care for it. The quicker you’re back home the better. Sinthinia’s punishment will just have to be this place for now.\n\n“Sin, if you value what remains of your pathetic life, you’ll never leave this place because the moment you do, I’ll be there to finish the job.” You say and head towards the exit.\n\nYou don’t remember Engan closing the door when he left, but you try the handle which doesn’t budge.\n\nYou then try more forceful methods to the point of attempting to punch through the door, but it’s like you’re punching solid adamantium. You aren’t making a dent. Your sword doesn’t either.\n\nYou waste no time in going for the windows, but it’s same effect, which is none at all.\n\nYou then hear a titter, which then turns into a cackle and then a long laugh which alternates in tone to sound like more than one person doing it. You turn to only see Sinthina, but she’s not looking like herself anymore. Besides the extra mouths and eyes, she’s only vaguely in her traditional succubus form anymore. It’s almost like she’s partially melted into the chair she was sitting in.\n\n“I told you, you were trapped bitch!” Sinthinia continues to laugh and then suddenly lunges at you.\n\nYou are slammed against the wall by her surprising strength and speed.\n\n“Look at it this way, you can try to finish the job like you bragged about earlier!”\n\nAt this range you see she’s either been transformed somehow or this isn’t Sin at all, especially when her face opens up and second set of jaws emerges. You manage to throw her off of you before she bites through your helmet.\n\nWith the apparent force that was preventing violence gone, you waste no time in using your sword against Sin. Whatever she’s transformed into may have improved her combat skills somewhat, but not enough to challenge you.\n\nYou easily chop off one of her arms, only for three slimy tentacles to grow out of the stump and attempt to pull your sword away.\n\n“You cannot win this fight Cista, you are trapped here with me and you will soon become one with the old ones. Can you hear them?”\n\nYour mind is flooded with several voices speaking at once. Some of the languages you don’t even know. Laughing, screaming, crying telling you to submit and join them. The mental assault is enough to halt you temporarily allowing Sinthinia to tackle you to the floor and partially bite through your armor, you feel a tearing at one of your wings by some appendage that has suddenly grown out of her.\n\nYou once again manage to throw Sin off and follow up by hacking at her deformed body before she can recover. All manner of colorful liquids ooze out of the wounds , including fat little worm like creatures with too many legs scurrying to get out of the way of your stomping boots.\n\nSin attempts to speak, but you’re not hearing whatever she’s got to say. Though you can’t be sure, but at least one of the things she’s babbling about in between you chopping her up is “Help me.” You begin to laugh as pieces of her splatter all over.\n\nAfter reducing Sin into an unrecognizable heap of gore, you notice your surroundings have changed severely. You’re no long in a house at all; you’re standing in the middle of what appears to be a gray haze you can’t see through.\n\nEngan appears with his arms folded. You attempt to attack him, but find that you’re stopped by an invisible barrier. In fact, you’re basically in a large transparent box.\n\n“It is regrettable that it came to this. If only you had been more willing to talk, perhaps this could have been handled a different way. Now this will be much harder.” Engan says.\n“I’m going to get out of here and when I do, you’ll be the first one on the list to join that dead whore behind me.” You retort.\n“I fear that will not happen little infernal. You will not leave this place for a very long time and when you do, you will finally understand the truth of reality. The old ones will eventually make you see, it is their will. And their will is absolute.”\n\nEngan disappears into the gray and you’re left alone. Completely alone. Sin’s body isn’t even with you anymore and the voices are gone.\n\nYou attempt physical attacks on the barrier, but of course it doesn’t work. You attempt to use your magic which surprisingly is working again, but not to any useful degree. Fire, ice, disintegrating, lightning, giant magical fists, none of it is working.\n\nYou don’t know how long you’re in your prison, but every now and then you see something moving within the gray outside.\n\nAnd then you hear the voices whispering in your mind getting louder and louder. They aren’t even attempting to speak in a coherent language you understand. It’s just madness.\n\nAs you attempt to mentally block out the voices, you see the gray starting to be replaced with blackness. This blackness starts enclosing on your position and you begin to lose your normally strong resolve. Fear takes over and whatever it is outside the box knows it.\n\nYou fall to the floor clutching your head, screaming for the sounds to get out of your mind. You close your eyes not wanting to see what is coming.\n\n“LOOK FLESH THING. LOOK UPON THE TRUTH OF YOUR EXISTENCE OR EMBRACE UTTER OBLIVION.” A deep voice utters.\n\nYou don’t want to look; you’ve never been so scared of anything as you are in this moment. You scream in defiance and blindly swing your sword, keeping your eyes closed the entire time.\n\nYou never hit anything. Not even the side of the prison you’re currently in. You do hear something else though.\n\n“So be it.”\n\nYou feel something grab you and before you can even open your eyes, you’re enveloped completely and annihilated.\n",
  "page 99": "You have to admit, stealing from Miss Olga does feel a bit wrong. If you’re going to steal, you’ll just steal the book itself. Assuming the book store you’re thinking of has one.\n\nStill, you need to calm Chloe down before she gets all upset.\n\n“Hm, I guess I’ll just continue to practice in the park. I have to get better at some point.” You remark.\n“Good. I don’t want you to get into more trouble, you’re the only friend I have here!” Chloe says and suddenly hugs you.\n\nYou weren’t expecting a hug, especially that strong of one. You aren’t exactly sure how to act, except you give a minor pat on her back.\n\n“Okay, you’re holding me too tight.” You say.\n“Oh sorry. I didn’t hurt you did I? I don’t realize how strong I am sometimes.” Chloe asks.\n“No, I’m fine. Anyway, since we’re stuck inside, I guess we could play a game. Tafl is over there, might as well bring it over here.”\n\nChloe goes over to get the game, to which she expresses a desire to play as the attacker. You figured she would since that’s usually what she always plays as, while you play the king’s side.\n\nTime passes and eventually other children start walking in since Miss Olga has called that it’s time for bed. Patty eventually waddles in makes some snide comments to Chloe as usual causing a few of the others to laugh as well until eventually Miss Olga steps in to order everyone to be quiet and get to bed.\n\nThe next day you eventually sneak off to the park as you do, except you sneak off to the used bookstore on Conjure Street instead.\n\nYou’ve never been in here, though you’ve seen it before. You enter the store and see the middle-aged man running the place. He’s balding and on the heavier side.\n\nOdd…you can’t get a good handle on his face though. It’s almost like it’s blurred. Sometimes you get glimpses. He has a moustache? In any case, he watches you come in and immediately speaks.\n\nAnd now you can’t quite understand what he’s saying. Maybe he’s speaking a language you don’t know. With some effort you think he’s asking you what you’re looking for.\n\nYou mention you’re just looking which seems to agitate him a bit, but then a few others come walking in and ask for something specific turning his attention to them allowing you to slip away.\n\nYou disappear into the stacks, not exactly sure of where to look. You just know you have to be quick before you catch the attention of the store clerk again.\n\nEventually you make your way towards the back of the old shop and see a doorway with a curtain separating it from the rest of the store. You don’t think you’re supposed to just go in there, but the clerk is still pre-occupied with the other customers, so you nip inside.\n\nYou see more books, at first glance of some of them, you realize these are not magic books as the contents involve pictures of…well stuff you’re probably not supposed to be looking at.\n\nStill, there’s something here. You can just sense it. And that’s when you notice that on another wall away from all the naked people books, a couple of shelves of some very old looking books. A few of them are easily in reach, but it’s the one on the top shelf that catches your eye. It’s big black book lying by itself on its side.\n\nSurely THAT one is the one you’re looking for.\n\nIt’s high up though, you can’t reach it unless you attempt to climb on the other shelf. You aren’t sure if it will hold your weight though.\n",
  "page 10": "You’re not travelling with this angelic fuck no matter how polite he’s being. Besides the fact that you’re not here to make friends and have a job to do, you just don’t trust him. After all this IS supposed to be a prison. Who knows what the hell he did to get kicked out of the heavens in the first place.\n\n“I’ll find her myself. The closer I get, the better I can sense her. It isn’t like this place is brimming to the top with infernal aura.” You say.\n“Ah, you infernals always so distrusting. Very well, feel free to explore.” Engan replies and then teleports away.\n\nFeeling a little less annoyed now, you make your way towards the town.\n\nWhen you get to the outskirts of the town, you notice it’s pretty quiet. You aren’t seeing anyone even walking (or flying for that matter) around.\n\nYou get further in the town and that’s when you start seeing small groups of celestials. Or you’re guessing they are at any rate, they aren’t nearly as “impressive” looking as Engan. No shimmering silver skin here, just a bit of sickening sparkling and those feathery white wings. Other than that, they might as well be humans.\n\nDoesn’t take long for you to gain a lot of attention. Some of them start whispering and pointing at you. A couple of them wave and smile, but none of them are really approaching you though.\n\nSo much for celestial hospitality, though just well since you’d rather not have to talk with them and since you probably can’t kill them either, you don’t see much point in any type of interaction.\n\nWhat you don’t quite understand about this town as you travel through it, is the whole purpose of it. If this is supposed to be a prison for naughty angels, shouldn’t it just be a barren wasteland of gray? Also this place is again very “mortal” in appearance. Why would they need blacksmith shops, taverns and such? In fact do celestials even drink? You suppose the bad ones do, but then shouldn’t they NOT be doing that as part of the rehabilitation?\n\nThis of course then leads to the question of whose idea was it to make this place anyhow. Despite what Engan said about being disconnected from their heavenly realm, you’re still convinced this is a pretty shitty form of punishment. You could think of MUCH worse and more fitting punishments for this lot.\n\nIn any case, you still aren’t sensing Sinthinia like you thought you would. You can sense an infernal presence faint enough to know she is here, but you can’t tell if you’re actually getting any closer to her. You begin to get angry and the ongoing celestial aura in this place is still enough to give you discomfort in your armor.\n\nEventually you realize you might need some assistance and enter the tavern you saw to ask questions.\n\nIt’s pretty empty. You see a few angels sitting at a table and a barkeeper polishing glasses. The angels at the table look like they’re playing a game of some sort, but you don’t actually see any of them drinking though.\n\nWhile the barkeep continues to not look up or even acknowledge your entrance, the group of angels at the table actually waves you over to take a seat with them.\n\nSince the last thing you want to do is hang around a group of these sparkling fuckers, the barkeep it is.\n\nYou approach the barkeep who still hasn’t even looked up. He’s REALLY focused on polishing his glasses. You notice he’s muttering to himself though.\n\n“Must get clean. Can’t have a spot….” The barkeep says.\n“Hey you.” You say.\n“Must get clean…”\n“HEY!” you say raising your voice.\n\nHe finally looks up at you and doesn’t even seem surprised that you’re not another angel.\n\n“Huh? Oh. Did you need a drink?” he asks.\n“No, I need to know where the succubus is in this town.” You say.\n“There’s one here? Didn’t realize. I don’t leave this place very much though. Not many infernals come here anyway. Not really a place for them. Not really a place for anyone really. In fact I think you should go.”\n“I’m not leaving until I get what I came here for.”\n“Well if you don’t leave, you may get more than you bargained for.”\n\nAt this point the angel stops polishing the glass and slams it hard on the bar top. Hard enough in fact that he shatters it.\n\n“Oh no. I’ll have to clean that up too.” He says calmly looking at the glass.\n\n“Hey, demon girl. You might want to get away from barkeep there. He’s not quite right in the head, talks a lot of nonsense. Even we’ve given up on what he’s trying to say most of the time. Best to just leave him to cleaning and pouring drinks if you really want one. My name’s Posilodja. Come sit over here with us you infernal beauty.” One of the angels at the table calls over to you and pats the seat of a chair near him.\n\nInfernal beauty? Is this celestial actually trying to flirt with you? You’ve had mortals do a much better job in that area.\n\nYou might be amused if you weren’t so revolted by the thought.\n\n“I’m good standing over here, but since you’re so friendly, any of you bird winged fucks want to tell me where the succubus bitch is?”\n\n“Oh her? She’s around somewhere. Wish she was in my lap right now though, so I can put some goodness in her.”\n\nThis crude sexual joke is followed by all of the angels at the table laughing loudly and another making some additional joke. You roll your eyes.\n\n“Oh wow, did we actually offend you by our little jokes? An infernal? Thought you lot were supposed to have skin almost thicker than my holy instrument!” Posilodja says.\n“The only offensive thing around here, is your severe lack of imagination if you believe that. Your wit is about the same level as a mortal in these matters. What would an angel know about carnal pleasures anyway?”\n“Oh you’d be surprised infernal. Many celestials have…fallen due to engaging with mortals you know.”\n“And? That doesn’t exactly impress me. Shit, the bitch I’m looking for was an expert at fucking mortals for thousands of years. Just because you got love sick over some priestess and fucked her because she liked sparkling cock doesn’t make you an expert.”\n“Well, I could show you. We ALL could.”\n\nAt this moment the lead angel gets up followed by the other three also standing up. You instinctively grab your sword even though you know violence is prevented here.\n\n“With your permission of course…” Posilodja says with a smile and looking at his fellows for validation, which of course they give him by snickering.\n\n“You wish sparkle boy. Now you going to continue to waste my time or are you going to tell me where the succubus is?” you say.\n“Fine. I’ll tell you, but you’ll have to play a game with us first.” Posilodja replies.\n“Yeah, I don’t have time for fucking games.”\n“Well then I don’t have time to tell you the information you want to know. I’m betting our beloved mayor already offered and you turned him down. You’re not going to get many others here that are going to be willing to help find her and I guarantee, you are not going to find her unless someone leads you to her.”\n“Why are you lot protecting her? I mean she’s an infernal, I would think you’d want her out of here. Is she fucking all of you degenerates in this town?”\n“If only. I’m not sure if the mayor told you, but she does have a certain kind of asylum here thanks to some agreement he has with another infernal that’s passed through here a few times. Now granted we aren’t going to stop you from taking her, but we aren’t going to make it easy without something in return at least. Fortunately for you, I only want to play a game with you, we all do.”\n“A game huh? What is it?”\n“A simple card game. I can explain the rules and we can even play a few practice hands until you get the hang of it.”\n“So what’s in it for you?”\n“Nothing, other than we’ve been playing the game with the same people for…well a very long time. It would break up the monotony to play with someone different, especially an infernal as…interesting as yourself.”\n\nMaybe because you’ve never experienced this before by celestials, but you REALLY feel uneasy around this bunch. They’re all looking you up and down with desire in their eyes. You’re even covered up from head to toe in armor and about the only skin they can see is some of your face. You’ve had that experience from mortals and infernals before but you expect it from them and even then, you don’t get them doing it much anymore.\n\nYou’d probably feel less uneasy if you knew you could just chop their heads off, but since that isn’t an option about the best thing you could do is just ignore them and leave.\n",
  "page 98": "“Okay, okay, I’ll figure out something else.” You remark.\n“Good. I don’t want you to get into more trouble, you’re the only friend I have here!” Chloe says and suddenly hugs you.\n\nYou weren’t expecting a hug, especially that strong of one. You aren’t exactly sure how to act, except you give a minor pat on her back.\n\n“Okay, you’re holding me too tight.” You say.\n“Oh sorry. I didn’t hurt you did I? I don’t realize how strong I am sometimes.” Chloe asks.\n“No, I’m fine. Anyway, since we’re stuck inside, I guess we could play a game. Tafl is over there, might as well bring it over here.”\n\nChloe goes over to get the game, to which she expresses a desire to play as the attacker. You figured she would since that’s usually what she always plays as, while you play the king’s side. Time passes, as your mind is only half into the game as you think about how you’re going to go about stealing Miss Olga’s coin purse.\n\nEventually other children start walking in since Miss Olga has called that it’s time for bed. Patty eventually waddles in makes some snide comments to Chloe as usual causing a few of the others to laugh as well until eventually Miss Olga steps in to order everyone to be quiet and get to bed.\n\nYou don’t go to sleep immediately. You continue to plan what you’re going to do. It’s actually going to take patience, but you have to do it that way.\n\nStarting the next day, you put your plan into action. The first few times you sneak into Miss Olga’s room are the most difficult. You think you’re going to get caught at any moment.\n\nEventually you manage to slip a copper coin out of her purse and hide it away. Nobody sees you, nobody knows. Not even Miss Olga. It’s just a single coin after all.\n\nOver the course of a month, you manage to steal enough money that you’re certain you’d have enough for a book, but you don’t buy one. Instead, you only take a small portion of what you’ve stolen and instead buy sweets from a sweet shop close to the bookstore.\n\nYou eat the sweets and keep the wrappers they came in.\n\nNothing else of note happens at the orphanage in this time. It’s just the usual things with Miss Olga being overworked, Chloe being friendly and Patty being annoying. Well Patty being REALLY annoying.\n\nThough that all changes soon one day.\n\n“Miss Olga?” you say as she’s busily doing laundry.\n“Huh? Catalina? What is it, I’m busy with washing these clothes right now.” Miss Olga responds.\n“I…I think there’s something you really should see.”\n\nMiss Olga’s never known you to make yourself so readily available to her, let alone actively seeking her out, so she stops what she’s doing so you can show her what you’re talking about.\n\nYou go to the sleeping room and point out near the bottom of the headboard of Patty’s bed, a small piece of loose wood paneling.\n\n“Behind there.” You say.\n\nMiss Olga looks at you and then crouches down to move the paneling and finds a bunch of coins.\n\n“Wha…” Miss Olga says.\n“I woke up in the middle of the night and saw Patty fumbling around with something there, before slipping back into bed. This morning I guess I got curious and checked since I never saw Patty doing anything like that before since she’s usually snoring throughout the night, but when I saw what was behind there, I thought I should tell you.”\n\nMiss Olga is still looking and gathering the coins as you speak, she then also sees a few sweet wrappers with the coins.\n\n“I…thought something was amiss. I didn’t want to think it, but…” Miss Olga starts to say to herself and then stands back up with a mad expression.\n\n“Where’s Patty? Never mind, I know where she probably is.” Miss Olga says before storming out the room. She practically pushes Chloe out of the way as she’s coming into the room.\n\n“What’s going on? Miss Olga looks mad and she’s heading away from us this time. Which is weird since it’s usually the opposite if she’s angry.” Chloe says.\n“Let’s just say, I don’t think Patty’s going to be making fun of you anymore.” You remark.\n“Oh? Why’s that?”\n\nJust as you’re about to say something, you both hear loud yelling. This is followed by loud protests of innocence. Chloe looks at you, then looks out the doorway and then runs towards where you’re standing.\n\n“Miss Olga’s heading this way and she’s pulling Patty behind her!”\n\nSoon Miss Olga returns to the room with Patty nearly crying at this point. A bunch of the other children stand in the doorway watching.\n\n“You didn’t steal from me huh? Then how do you explain this?! These coins were found here!” Miss Olga points out the small hole in the wall.\n“What? I didn’t even know that was there!” Patty exclaims.\n“A likely story, Catalina said she saw you messing around with it in the middle of the night. Said all these coins were behind there! It’s about how much I seemed to have lost over the course of a month!”\n“SHE’S A BIG LIAR! I DIDN’T DO NUTHIN!” Patty screams and starts to cry.\n“I also found these sweet wrappers! I suppose that’s why not all of my coin is there. Surprised you didn’t just steal the sweets too.”\n“I DIDN’T STEAL NUTHIN! SHE PUT THOSE THERE!” Patty screams and then tries to rush towards you before Miss Olga pulls her back.\n\n“For the past month I thought I’d just been getting old and forgetful or possibly even careless. I knew I wasn’t losing my mind, just my coin apparently. I shouldn’t be surprised since I know you’ve nicked a few things from the pantry at times…but this. This is something entirely more serious.”\n“I DIDN’T DO IT! THAT BITCH IS LYING!”\n\nMiss Olga slaps Patty for swearing.\n\n“Catalina’s a lot of things, never known her to seek me out for anything though, let alone be a liar. She even confessed to a plan of trying to sneak a pet here once. In any case it’s obvious I’ve failed in my duties to at least keep you from being a criminal. I can’t provide the proper help you need. You’ll be moved to another facility, in the mean time, you’ll be sleeping where I can keep my eye on you.”\n\nPatty at this point is dragged away kicking and screaming, calling you all sorts of names. A few of the children follow Miss Olga to see what will happen next. A few linger in the room, looking at you. One of the girls who tended to hang out with Patty speaks up.\n\n“My bed is right next to Patty’s and that fat ass snores all damn night. Everyone knows that. I would have known if she had been waddling around in the middle of the night. I also would have known if she had been stealing from Miss Olga because she tells me everything. She wasn’t smart enough to keep something like that a secret for that long.” She says accusingly.\n“Hm. She was smart enough to fool Miss Olga. Smart enough to fool you too apparently. Good thing I helped stop her, who knows what someone like that could do if they REALLY put their mind to it.” You reply.\n\nYour expression displays a subtle threatening demeanor, which is enough to shut the girl up and cause all of them to back off. They eventually all leave the room, leaving just you and Chloe alone, though even Chloe is looking a bit concerned.\n\n“So I’m thinking about going to the park to practice my magic, did you want to come with me? Maybe I’ll try to change the color of some flowers.” You say.\n“Um, no. Maybe later.”\n\nYou nod and begin to walk out the bed area, though as you do you hear Chloe call out:\n\n“Catalina?”\n“Yes?”\n“Thank you.”\n\nYou nod again and quickly make your way to the park, ignoring the rest of the yelling and screaming that’s still going on between Miss Olga and Patty with everyone else listening and watching.\n\nYou eventually get to the secluded part of the park that you always go to and focus…\n\nIt doesn’t even take long, but you change the colors of some yellow flowers to blue. The funny thing is you aren’t even surprised by your quick success. It’s like you knew somehow that you’d succeed.\n\nYou try a couple other things like making a patch of grass grow, making more flowers wilt, but that isn’t what you really want to try.\n\nYou head back to that group of bushes where you first saw the grave wings. You around near the bottom and sure enough, the corpse of the cat is still there. It’s mostly bones now though and even some of those are missing.\n\nYou focus on the cat…\n\nAnd focus…\n\nAnd focus…\n\nAnd then you see it. You see it move. Not much, but it moves.\n\nThen it begins to try to stand, a little difficult though given that it’s missing a whole leg. It also makes strange hissing sounds, though it shouldn’t be able to make any sounds at all given that it doesn’t have any of the organs left that would allow such a thing.\n\nThe newly resurrected cat then tries to swipe at you. You pull back before it can hit you. You attempt to control it, but you’re unable as it continues to half drag itself towards you.\n\nWithout thinking, you shoot a bolt of energy from your finger, which at this range causes the skeletal cat to shatter into several pieces. Your hand feels like it’s on fire and you even fall backwards from the shock.\n\nYou rub your hand with the other hoping the pain will go away, which it eventually does. As you stand up, your whole body feels a bit weak now. You don’t know if it’s because of all the magic you’ve been doing or what, but you think that’s enough today. You’re lucky nobody stumbled onto you while you were doing all this.\n\nStill though, you’ve learned that you can do more than just wilt flowers. So much more. You don’t know what was different exactly today considering you’d been practicing for weeks and nothing happened. All of a sudden today, you performed more magic than you ever had in less than a day.\n\nYou don’t know if it’s because you tapped into something you hadn’t before, if you were confident, maybe all that practice actually paid off or maybe it was a combination of all of it.\n\nYou do know things are going to be different now.\n",
  "page 12": "Well you’re already here; you might as well try even if diplomacy has never been your strong suit.\n\nYou think for a moment on HOW to even approach this, but there really isn’t any room for trickery here.\n\nThen you come up with something that even you can’t believe you’re considering this, but it just might work. If it doesn’t, you’re not sure what will.\n\n“Sin, since you’re at least correct in that I can’t harm you, tell me, do you believe you’ll leave this place and retake the power you once had?” You say.\n\nSinthinia looks a little surprised at your question.\n\n“It’s looking pretty grim right now, so I have no idea. However if I have the opportunity, I believe I would. Though you did a pretty good job of destroying everything I have and I imagine I’d have to somehow build up such a position in secrecy since I know you’d be the first one to try to kill me again.” Sinthinia replies.\n“So are you content on just living out the rest of your existence in this place?” you ask.\n“I suppose I’ll have to be.”\n“Hm, so your life means more. Just as expected.”\n“What are you talking about.”\n“I’m talking about another example of why infernal whores like yourself are ultimately weak. YOU were a figure of fear if not respect at one time. You commanded legions and held much territory for a succubus. While I never doubted that you’d eventually fall to my attack, I can admit with some reluctance you were a more formidable foe than I initially believed.”\n“Funny that I should hear the sincerest praise I’ve ever heard from another infernal is from you.”\n“Yeah well that praise as you call it, brings me to the point of how you squandered it all. You thought you were untouchable and all you were really was lazy and complacent in your position. The proof is how you’re willingly able to throw it all away. You’re satisfied with just staying here existing. If I’m being more truthful, your degenerate hedonism isn’t what really disgusts me about you. You’re a succubus; I ultimately can understand you can’t help it on some level. No, it’s your weakness and lack of willpower. That’s ultimately why you needed to go, you were beyond fixing, let alone trusting and you would have no place in what I’m attempting to do.”\n“Ah yes your futile attempt to bring order to the chaotic infernal realm. You do realize how silly that goal is don’t you? No, of course you don’t, you’re wonderfully either naïve or outright stupid enough to believe that just because you desire it, you can make it reality. Reality is a complete lie; my short time in this place has opened my eyes to that. You’re correct in that I thought I was untouchable, you are however very wrong in me being lazy OR complacent. I was planning and plotting the long game. A succubus’ main strength is infiltration and you best believe I used it to my fullest extent. I had agents in the highest areas of the infernal realm. EVEN in the bloated palaces of the so-called Lords of Hell. I would have brought them all down eventually.”\n\nYou see you’ve stirred Sin a little from her former apathy; maybe you’re getting somewhere.\n\n“So what happened?”\n“YOU. You’re what fucking happened. I was so focused on other things; I never paid much attention to you. I wrote you off as a misguided young infernal that the realm would soon sort out. Wasn’t until you attacked that I paid any real attention to you. After the first attacks I set things in motion to have you assassinated and sabotaged. At least ONE of those attempts SHOULD have worked or at least hindered you, but for whatever reason you kept defying the odds.”\n“So you’re claiming I defeated you by chance?”\n“Or someone was helping you secretly by undoing my plans. In fact, looking back on it now, it probably was Big Red. Not sure WHY I didn’t see that before.”\n“What? Why the fuck would he help me, I never even met him until he rescued you.”\n“Why the fuck does he do anything? He’s got so many plots interweaved I have to imagine that even he gets confused. I mean if I had to guess, he set us BOTH up. I mean he’s taken out one of his greatest rivals for power and a potential up and coming threat. Congrats on being an unwitting pawn.”\n\nSin’s attempt at mocking you fails, though if she’s correct you don’t like the implication. It’s something you can use though.\n\n“Once again, I’ll remind you that I am not trapped in this place. Which brings me to my next point, how would you like to come back home with me?” you ask.\n“What? You’re joking right? Why the fuck would I willingly go with you, knowing what you have in store for me?” Sin says.\n“Well…how about I make a deal with you right here. I promise to give you a fair chance at defending yourself. I won’t kill or even torture you. You’ll be allowed to live and recover from your weakened state and when you’re back up to full strength, we’ll settle up.”\n“Fair chance? We BOTH know that’s not going to happen. Even if we made a binding deal, where you stuck completely to your word, I am not going to beat you in a one on one fight. Our last confrontation was proof of that.”\n“So what then? You’re going to just go on living in this dreary exile filled with celestials that were too naughty to stick around in their own realm? Shit, I know I’d rather be dead. If you take my offer, at least you’d die with a modicum of dignity and while I know infernals don’t give a shit about such things, it’s still gotta be better than this.”\n“How do you know I’ll be trapped here? Maybe I’ll eventually get out.”\n“True, but how long will that take? If you take my offer now, you’ll be out quicker and I’ll point out that anything could happen within your recovering time. For all you know I’ll be killed in a battle or taken out by an assassin. Maybe you’ll manage to escape sucking off my guards and using your magical succubus vagina. Maybe you somehow manage to convince me NOT to kill you or maybe somehow you actually manage to beat me in combat. The future isn’t written after all.”\n“This is an interesting offer, but this still seems all in your favor.”\n“Of course it is. I’m only doing this so I can get the satisfaction of ending you once and for all, but as I said, I’m giving you better odds than you otherwise would have or even deserve. However, I can’t force you to come with me so the choice is yours.”\n\nSinthinia nods and is silent for a moment as if lost in thought. She actually closes her eyes for a few moments. You just watch her for awhile until your patience for a decision is up.\n\n“Well?” you ask.\n“Very well I accept. I haven’t been here that long in this place and it’s been more of a nightmare than I’ve let on. How much have you interacted with Engan or any of the other celestials here?” Sin asks.\n“Not much and only Engan.”\n“Lucky you. Before you got here, I had to interact with several of them. They’re very off. They look like celestials but don’t really act like them you know? Something about them is unnatural. I’m sure you’ve noticed it.”\n“Hm, they are a little strange, but I’m guessing that’s due to them not being typical celestials. Anyway, you ready?”\n“Yes, but first we have to make the deal. And don’t think I know you won’t try to slip in a loop hole so you can just chop my head off as soon as we get back!”\n\nAfter much debating and semantics, you and Sinthinia finally come to an agreement and make the binding contract.\n\nThe pair of you leave the house and make your way back towards where you first came in. Doesn’t take long as even in her wounded state, Sin is able to fly as fast as you can.\n\nYou get back to the tree and take out the beacon stone, though before you can activate it, Engan appears.\n\n“Ah, I see you ladies have settled your differences and are heading home together. An unusual outcome, as I was sure you would go home in frustration. I’m glad that didn’t happen though.” Engan says.\n“Why the fuck should any of this matter to you?” you ask.\n“Oh call me an optimist, but I like to think that anyone can change their nature. The fact that you two even came to an agreement is proof of that.”\n“I don’t think you know the nature of the agreement.”\n“It doesn’t matter, it still shows a willingness to embrace change and that’s the important thing. Farewell infernals.”\n\nAs Engan disappears again, you shake you head at his flakey celestial philosophy and open the portal.\n\nYou look at Sin, who steps forward toward the portal. You half expect her to turn right back around and flee, but she doesn’t, she just looks back at you and then enters. You follow immediately after.\n\nEverything goes white and you soon find yourself back in Sin’s room. None of your soldiers or Zeljenir are here. In fact, you’re wondering where Sin is, though you don’t need to for long.\n\nYou feel a crushing blow from above and you get slammed to the floor by a heavy mass.\n\nYou manage to twist your body from underneath the blobby mass on top of you and see that it is indeed Sin, but only barely. Her lower half is a formless mass of flesh with various appendages coming from them and her upper half isn’t much different. Her head (Which now has several eyes and mouths) unnaturally stretches down to meet yours.\n\n“Engan was right, the willingness to embrace change is a very important thing.” Sin says, though several voices emanate from her. Some of them screaming, laughing and generally gibbering.\n\nYou manage to get one of your arms free to cast an acid blast in Sin’s face. She reels back shrieking and wailing, but it doesn’t stop her attack, several tentacles grab your arm and you feel several mouths trying to bite through your armor.\n\nWhatever you just brought back isn’t the Sinthinia that originally left. It all makes sense now with how everything felt off, but also some of the conversations you had with her and Engan.\n\nSeveral of your soldiers finally show up alerted by the noise, but unfortunately several things are now coming through the portal. Meanwhile you’re stuck under Sinthinia’s bulk and she’s in the process of focusing all her attention on ripping you apart and trying to devour you.\n\nIt would appear that breaking the binding contract hasn’t weakened her at all, but then she’s no longer infernal.\n\nAnd now, no longer are you.\n",
  "page 15": "While you’d rather not waste anymore time in this place, you get impression that just wandering around yourself isn’t going to be as quick as if you got the help of some of the locals. So if that means playing some stupid game to get Sinthinia then so be it.\n\nYou take a seat.\n\n“Alright, so explain the rules, play through a couple practice hands, and then play for real. After that you take me to Sinthinia.” You say.\n“Absolutely. So what do we get?” Posil asks.\n“I thought you said you just wanted to break up the monotony.”\n“Oh right. I did. Well I mean in retrospect it seems like we should be getting something out of this than just your lovely company.”\n“Well you should have made that stipulation before you made your initial offer. My company is all you’re getting and be grateful you’re even getting that.”\n“Hm, well I suppose we lack the quick tricky tongue that you infernal types have for making deals. Very well, I suppose your company will have to suffice, but I think you’ll change your mind.”\n“Can we get on with the fucking game?”\n\nPosil begins to explain the rules of the game, which is very confusing. Partly because Posil is explaining the rules so fast you can barely understand everything and also because the rules are convoluted to begin with.\n\nConvoluted to the point that you actually have to stop Posil from his fast-talking to re-explain things.\n\n“Wait, what does a blue star mean again?” you ask.\n“It means you pull another card, but only if it’s your second turn.” Posil says.\n“I thought that was three green skulls.”\n“No, that means you reverse the order of play.”\n“I thought that was nine black crosses.”\n“No, you draw four more cards on your first turn with those.”\n“By the gods, are these infernals fucking thick. Can’t even understand a simple fucking game. Then again I guess they don’t do much thinking. Just a lot of fighting and fucking.” One of the angels snorts.\n“Celestial if things were different, I guarantee you’d know all about getting fucked with my blade up your ass.”\n“Okay, okay, everyone settle down. Let’s just play the game, you’ll get it soon enough.”\n\nYou start to play through your practice hands, which go about as expected. You half understanding what’s going on and losing.\n\nWhat isn’t expected though is you start to feel odd, like occasionally seeing double. At one point you look at your cards and it’s almost as if the images on them are changing.\n\n“Your turn infernal” Posil says.\n“Oh. Here.” You answer throwing down a card.\n“I needed one of those.” An angel says.\n“Well keep needing, because I’m taking it.” Another says.\n“This is why you never win, you’re always announcing your intentions.” Posil remarks.\n\n“…damn…” you mutter closing your eyes.\n\nYou experience another moment of disorientation and you look again and see your cards changing and hear whispering voices. You can’t make out what they’re saying but it’s really intrusive.\n\nYou blink again, and it’s all stopped, though now there’s a red portal in the room. None of the angels seem to notice or even acknowledge it.\n\nYou aren’t sure what’s going on here, but it’s more than just a card game.\n\n“Is there a problem infernal?” Posil asks.\n",
  "page 9": "“Fine, lead the way.” You say keeping your eyes on him. Engan nods and glides towards the town ahead.\n\nEngan attempts to make conversation about unrelated topics such as asking about what you do exactly in the infernal realm. You give nothing but silence, which doesn’t deter him from speaking though. He just starts talking a bit about himself and how he used to be some sort of teacher. You’re not really paying attention and soon tell him to shut up. Engan takes the hint and remains silent.\n\nWhen you get to the outskirts of the town, you notice it’s pretty quiet. You aren’t seeing anyone even walking (or flying for that matter) around. You get further in the town and that’s when you start seeing small groups of celestials. Or you’re guessing they are at any rate, they aren’t nearly as “impressive” looking as Engan. No shimmering silver skin here, just a bit of sickening sparkling and those feathery white wings. Other than that, they might as well be humans.\n\nDoesn’t take long for you to gain a lot of attention. Some of them start whispering and pointing at you both, but none of them approach and just hurry out of the way.\n\nEventually Engan gets to one of the gray houses and waves his hand causing the door to open.\n\n“She’s inside, though she’s probably going to be surprised to see you.” Engan says.\n“Aren’t you going in?” you ask.\n“I mean I certainly can, but I assumed you didn’t want me around during this confrontation. Again though, I’m not exactly sure what you think you’re going to accomplish, as you won’t be able to harm her.”\n\nYou say nothing and just stare at Engan.\n\n“Very well I’ll go in first.” Engan replies.\n\nEngan enters the house and you follow behind him. The house is simple in nature. Looks little better than a typical mortal peasant’s home, though perhaps much cleaner.\n\nAs is typical of this place, everything is a dull gray color. Chairs, table, everything.\n\n“Liar.” You say.\n“Excuse me?” Engan replies.\n“You said Sinthinia was in here, the place is empty.”\n“She’s here, she’s just invisible. Desperately trying to hide no doubt. She’s in that chair over there. Look.”\n\nEngan waves his hand and sure enough Sinthinia appears. She’s still burned, but not as bad as you last saw her. Must have regenerated a bit. She looks at you both with a mixture of resignation and fear.\n\n“Really Engan? You couldn’t have at least kept me hidden?” Sinthinia says.\n“Well this one seemed like she was really insistent on finding you and I like to accommodate guests here. Besides, as I’ve said to both of you already, you can’t harm each other.” Engan says.\n\nYou once again try to use your sword on Sin which is stopped by some sort of invisible barrier. You attempt several times, but you cannot break through. Any use of magic also fails. (Again)\n\nThe whole time Sin is cringing and curling up in the chair as you attempt to end her permanently. She relaxes though when she sees that it is true and you can’t harm her.\n\nHer eyes widen again however when you grab her wrist.\n\n“Hey! I thought you said she can’t harm me!” Sin says.\n“She can’t, just wait.” Engan replies.\n\nYou pull Sin from the chair, but that’s about as far as you get with her. Whatever force was preventing you from striking her with a sword, prevents you from continuing to pull her to a location where you CAN do harm to her. Your hand suddenly goes numb to the point you lose your grip and then immediately snaps back to normal.\n\nYou end up smashing the nearby table with your sword and cursing loudly. This causes Sin to snicker while Engan looks on.\n\n“Told you.” Engan sniffs.\n\nBetween Engan’s told you so attitude, Sin’s mockery, your frustration of the situation, and the continued feeling of unease in this place are all starting to take a toll.\n\n“Shut up celestial and mark my words succubus whore, you WILL pay. This place cannot protect you forever.” you snap.\n“Well it actually can. I mean that’s sort of the point of this place. Trust me infernal, there have been many attempts by other visitors and yes even every celestial that came here at one point or another that attempted to commit violence. It just won’t happen.” Engan says.\n“There has to be a way.”\n“The place won’t let it happen. I can’t explain it. Nobody can. This place defies violent actions. It’s a place of purity.”\n“Purity. You make it sound like the celestial realm.”\n“Trust me infernal, this place is nothing like the celestial realm. The celestial realm isn’t immune to violence, if it was, we would not have an infernal realm in the first place. This place also lacks the light, the positive aura, the feeling of joy and several other things that distract from the truth. This place only deals with the pure truth of how things really are.”\n\nEngan’s eyes seem to stare off into the distance when speaks of this truth and purity. His skin also begins to almost flicker as opposed to the slow shimmering it was doing before.\n\nMeanwhile Sinthinia has been more or less silent and sitting in her chair. She hasn’t made any sort of move to escape, but then of course there’s nowhere to go and you can’t harm her anyway.\n\nYou attempt to pick up the chair she’s sitting in which works, but then she just hops out of it knowing that you’re trying to transport her outside the house. Attempting to tie her to the chair doesn’t work for the same reasons of trying to grab her. As soon as Sin struggles you’re pushed back.\n\nEventually Engan stops watching you fail and begins to leave.\n\n“You don’t think all of that hasn’t been tried before in the past for various reasons? The sooner you realize you can’t defy the laws of this place, the better off you’ll be. In any case, I have other things to attend to, so I’ll leave you ladies to talk I guess.” Engan says and exits the house.\n\nNot sure of how to proceed you break another piece of furniture and sit down on one of the few remaining non-broken chairs pondering your next move.\n\n“I knew you hated me, but I don’t think I knew just how much until recently.” Sinthinia suddenly says.\n\nYou ignore her comments, but she keeps talking.\n\n“Not that it matters, but since you obviously can’t do what you really want to do, you mind answering a question just for the shits and giggles? What exactly did I do to you? I mean YOU attacked my territory first and you didn’t even make the effort to reach out for any sort of alliance.”\n“Alliance? Like you would have honored such an arrangement.” You scoff.\n“Okay, true, but you’ve allied with other infernal leaders and you can’t say that they’re any less duplicitous.”\n“Such arrangements are low calculated risks due to their power. Such a risk could not be taken with you.”\n“Hm. I suppose I should be flattered that you considered me dangerous enough to just destroy me. Still, doesn’t explain your fanaticism, which apparently was so extreme that you felt you had to chase me here. Even with this place’s weird laws, you’re STILL trying to figure out a way to hurt me or drag me back to a place where you can. I mean fuck, I’ve lost everything and I’m not coming back from it. Look at me, I don’t even have my infernal beauty anymore. I got fucking celestial burns that aren’t going to heal anytime soon, especially not in this place. Am I even worth it?”\n“You’re just trying to talk your way out of this again. It won’t work.”\n“And YOU still haven’t answered my original question? WHY is it so important that you kill me? Right now you could be murdering the shit out of hundreds of others more of a threat than I am right now.”\n\nShe sort of has a point, even if she is just trying to save her own skin. You’ll play though, not like you have anything better to do right now.\n\n“Okay, I’ll answer you. Besides the obvious fact that leaving you alive opens up the possibility that you’ll somehow get out of here, gather power and come back for revenge one day, there’s also the fact that you’re a good example of everything that’s wrong with the infernal realm. You’re a good representation of the rot, corruption and decadence common to infernals. The traits I wish to lessen if not eliminate completely.” You say.\n“Oh really? Not any of your underlings that are no doubt scheming for their chance to backstab you? Not Big Red who got us here in the first place? Not the infamous so called Lords of Hell who just let all the shit happen under their noses and do fuck all or actively encourage it? Me huh? I’m the fucking cause of all the universes ills? Pfft, I fucking wish.” Sin remarks.\n“Perhaps not, but you asked and I answered.”\n“And it was a bullshit answer, you know what I think?”\n“I don’t give a shit what you think.”\n“Well too bad, you’re going to listen anyway. All your talk about order is just a defense technique because you’re a repressed cunt that is unable to truly embrace what you actually are. You may look and act like a war infernal, but underneath it all, you’re like me with one difference, you were an idiot that did something to yourself that limited your potential, so you went a different route thinking that it would fulfill you. It didn’t and you just hate the fact that I’m everything YOU could have been…”\n“Oh? And what’s that? Burnt to shit and trapped here with nothing?” you interrupt.\n“You’re trapped here too bitch.”\n“No I’m not, I have a way to leave. I mean that was part of the point, wouldn’t make sense to just follow you with no way back. And you can stop now with your weak attempts to analyze me. There is literally nothing you can say that I haven’t already heard OR already gone over myself in my head that is going to get to me.”\n\nSinithinia has no come back, looks like that last bit of venom was her last pathetic card to play. She knows it too; she just slinks back in her chair looking at the floor.\n\nStill, you really can’t do anything to her except talk.\n\nPart of the discussion so far with her has got you wondering if you shouldn’t just leave. She’s been thoroughly defeated and while there is the possibility that she might pop up again one day, you might just have to take that chance. You beat her before, you can do it again.\n\nUnless you somehow try to talk her into going with you, but you can’t see that remotely working and you might be just wasting time here.\n",
  "page 17": "“Yeah there’s a portal right over there that just appeared.” You say and point at it.\n“What portal?” Posil asks and looks over in the direct that you pointed.\n“That one right there!”\n“I don’t see anything.”\n“The infernal is seeing shit.” One angel says.\n“I’m telling you there’s a fucking portal right over here, it’s fucking red! Look!”\n\nPosil looks closer and puts a hand to his chin.\n\n“Hm, I’m not seeing what you’re seeing, is it over by the bartender?”\n“What? It’s nowhere near him! It’s over by the…oh fuck it…” you say and stand up to walk over to where the portal is.\n\nWhen you get closer to the portal it hasn’t changed at all though by the looks of the angels, they don’t seem convinced anything is there. Posil asks if any of them see anything but none of them do.\n\nPosil gets up and walks over towards you.\n\n“I think you’re seeing things my demon beauty. Though this place has been known to have that affect on your kind seeing as it was designed more for us celestial types and all.” Posil remarks.\n\nAs Posil is walking about saying how you’re seeing things, he walks right through the portal and out the other side like it wasn’t there.\n\n“What…” you say and get closer to the portal yourself.\n\nThen suddenly you feel a very strong pull towards the portal!\n\n“I can’t believe she fell for that! These brimstone bitches, all beauty and no brains. We were good to our deal though, you played with us and now you get to see the other infernal cunt. Though maybe just not in the way you thought, I’m sure an infernal such as yourself can appreciate the situation.” Posil laughs.\n\nAs the other angels join in on his laughter you attempt to resist being pulled into the portal, but no matter how much you struggle or fight, it’s just too strong and you eventually are sucked into the portal.\n\nWhen you come out, you’re in some place surrounded by a gray haze. Before you can get your bearings however, you feel a crushing blow to the back of your head and get slammed to what seems to be an invisible floor by a heavy mass.\n\nYou manage to roll out of the way of the next assault to see what’s attacking you and see it’s Sinthinia, but only barely. Her lower half is a formless mass of flesh with various appendages coming from them and her upper half isn’t much different. Her head has several eyes and mouths.\n\n“Cista, I’m so glad you followed me here, now we can finally settle our differences.” Sin says, though several voices emanate from her. Some of them screaming, laughing and generally gibbering.\n\nYou manage to lop off several of her appendages and instinctively you start casting magic, which surprisingly works here (wherever that is). Sinthinia gets in her own attacks and damages your armor.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, you’d beat her easily even in her new horrible form. The problem lies in that she’s not alone and voices start invading your mind. Whispers of giving up, joining them and general madness all keep you off your game making the combat more difficult.\n\nYou slash, chop, burn and disintegrate Sin’s unstructured body, but you soon learn about these ancient ones she kept babbling about.\n\nThe gray outside your prison has turned completely black, the incoherent voices of madness are even louder. Your attempts to mentally block them out fail, as you can’t escape to anywhere. In one of the rare times of your life, fear and hopelessness takes you over completely\n\nYou fall to the floor clutching your head, screaming for the sounds to get out of your mind. You close your eyes not wanting to see what is coming.\n\nYou don’t initially, but you feel everything and eventually the rest of your senses follow, but by the time that happens you’re not yourself anymore.\n",
  "page 16": "If you didn’t trust one angel willing to help you, there’s no reason you’re going to trust a group of them who are obviously here for failing whatever celibacy rules they’re supposed to follow.\n\n“I’ll find her myself.” You say and turn to walk away.\n“Very well, we’ll be still be here if you change your mind. If you don’t well at least we get to watch you walk out the door.” Posilodja says causing more snickering from his friends.\n\nYou can’t take their tiresome innuendo anymore and you end up picking up a nearby chair and throwing it at them. One of them immediately ducks out of the way, while the rest do nothing but laugh as it bounces off some invisible barrier causing no harm other than the chair that breaks into pieces.\n\n“What the hell are you ducking for ya idiot? She can’t hurt us remember?” one of them says to the other on the floor.\n“I dunno, instinct I guess.” He replies.\n“The infernal is hot tempered along with having that hot armored bod! Watch out fellas!” Posilodja laughs.\n\nWhile you scowl in anger, you notice the barkeep quickly go over to the remnants of the chair and clean it up. You can’t do anything else here other than take away their source of amusement by leaving so you do so.\n\nYou walk away from the tavern trying to cool down and you don’t have much luck in doing so since you’re still pissed about not being able to find Sinthinia. You ask a few other angels (Well more like demand), but other than some overly pleasantness that seems forced, you don’t get the answers you seek.\n\nLacking any other ideas, you decide to start just entering houses and buildings. The problem is this doesn’t work. You can enter the public buildings just fine, but whenever you attempt to enter a house, an invisible force stops you even when the door is open.\n\n“What the fuck, I’m not a fucking vampire!” you say the first time you encounter this situation.\n\nAttempting to bash down the doors or windows doesn’t work either and the only thing that you do succeed in doing is getting a few angels asking you nicely to leave their homes alone and what is troubling you.\n\n“YOU! ALL OF YOU SPARKLING FUCKS ARE TROUBLING ME! I WISH I COULD KILL YOU ALL SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY!” you shout.\n“Funny enough, they probably wish that too.” You hear a voice say behind you.\n\nYou turn around and see a gaunt looking man with long hair, he looks somewhat raggedy and you even catch a whiff of body odor coming off of him, though the fact he isn’t sparkling makes him immediately more tolerable.\n\n“You’re a human, not an angel.” You say.\n“No shit. Then again neither are most of the inhabitants of this town. Or at least not really anymore. My name is Arash” The man says.\n“What’re you doing here? You a prisoner here?”\n“Aren’t we all? Though in my case, I’m here by accident. Had a magic ring that allowed me to travel to different planes, though it wasn’t exactly the most reliable as I soon found out. Ran out of power and got stranded here. Been stuck here ever since and it sucks a lot. I should have died from a lack of food and water a long time ago, but this place is just keeping me alive. I suppose it COULD be worse, I could have ended up from where you’re from.”\n“The mayor said the angels usually assist you in heading back home.”\n“Pfft. They can’t assist in doing shit and the mayor is the biggest fucking liar here. The few other mortals that have had the misfortune of stumbling in here to my knowledge have never left and non-mortals don’t do much better.”\n“Wait, so all I’ve seen so far is angels, where are the non-angels then?”\n“Probably locked away in an area known as the Cells. That’s where they tend to go.”\n\nSo far this human seems to be the most “tolerable” person you’ve encountered here. Though given what he’s telling you this does raise some questions.\n\n“Okay, so how exactly are they shoving non-celestials in cells? Isn’t that an act of violence, to take people where they don’t want to be?” you ask.\n“Of course it is. Hence why they just trick people into them. That helpful act usually comes with a price and before they know it, the trusting fools are locked away here. And before you ask, I never trusted them to begin with, let alone accepted their help hence why I’m walking around in town and not in some cell. They don’t really like it, but not much they can directly do.” The man says.\n“So did you see a couple of infernals arrive here before I did?”\n“Yeah, I figured that’s why you were here. Saw Big Red and some other female demon though she got taken away pretty quickly. She was screaming saying how much pain she was in from the burning. Guessing some angels helped her too and she’s probably in the cells.”\n“Damn, wait you know of Big Red?”\n“I’d ask if they were friends of yours, but I know you infernals don’t tend to have any. Not to mention I know enough of Big Red to know he’s definitely nobody’s friend. He tried to offer me a deal once to get out of here and I thought ‘d be better off asking the fallen celestials for help with what he’d probably do with my body and soul.”\n“I’ve heard he’s been here before.”\n“He’s been here several times. He and the mayor of this town got some sort of arrangement. I’m guessing it might have something to do with the cells, but I don’t really know. Probably had the agreement longer than I’ve been here that’s for certain.”\n“Is there anyway to get into the cells? I need to find that burned succubus bitch you mentioned.”\n“You can’t get in there without help from the celestials, and you don’t want their help. If this is some sort of attempt at revenge for whatever reason, trust me whatever she did to you, she’s paying for it now.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Well…because I may have managed to get into the place once and let’s just say I didn’t like what I saw. If I could sleep in this dreary prison, I think I’d have nightmares about the place. Even without being able to sleep I still see mental images of shit. The sights, the sounds, the SMELLS…it’s not good.”\n“I’m an infernal, whatever so called horrors you saw I’m sure pale in comparison to what I’ve seen back home.”\n“Perhaps you’re right. However, something about the place just felt really wrong. I mean…I dunno I can’t explain it. I threw up shortly after stepping foot into the place and then after seeing a few things, I ran out as soon as I could. I think the mayor knows I’ve been in there, but has never said anything.”\n“So if you’ve been able to get in there, you can get me in there.”\n“Have you listened to a word I’ve said? The place is horrible and I’ll never go back it! As I said, if the succubus you’re hunting is in there, then you don’t need to get revenge or whatever, she’s paying for shit she’s done to you and then some, trust me. Honestly if you’ve got a way to get out of this place then I’d say just chalk this up as a win and head back to your home.”\n\nAt this point you’re inclined to take the human’s advice because you’ve about had it with this place. And if what he’s saying is remotely true, then you suppose Sinthinia isn’t going to be bothering you anytime soon.\n\nOf course, you don’t like loose ends either and your desire to see this through and make Sinthinia pay personally hasn’t diminished.\n",
  "page 91": "This isn’t right, but you get the impression that running won’t help. So you stay put and hope you can deal with this situation.\n\nMiss Olga starts speaking positively about you, probably exaggerating a bit, but she doesn’t actually lie. Meanwhile the adult couple listens intently and occasionally smiles at you. Well you think they’re smiling, you still can’t make out their faces.\n\nAt some point one of them speaks to you and asks you questions. The voice is muffled and distorted though. You can’t make out their voices anymore than you can make out their faces.\n\nNevertheless, you give them answers that you believe they’re asking for. It’s mostly yes or no. Miss Olga goes on to say how you’re a little on the shy side hence why you’re not elaborating much.\n\nHonestly you’re really having a hard time focusing on any of what’s going on. It’s all sort of a blur and before you know what’s going on, you’ve been adopted.\n\nYou think you have anyway.\n\nHave you?\n\nChloe says how she’ll miss you and gets a little weepy when you say goodbye to her. Miss Olga mentions that how the couple check out and that they will be very good parents to you.\n\nWere they?\n\nYou don’t remember.\n\nThere’s an image of you going home with them. It’s a nice home. Seems familiar somehow, but it’s not how you remember it. Everything is made of bones for one.\n\nThe chairs, the table, the beds, everything.\n\nYour new parents are now visible. Their fleshless faces are clear as day. You feel so safe with them.\n\nThey’re hugging you and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this. Obviously that wasn’t how your life went. It was sort of a comforting image though and you briefly wonder how different things would have been if you’d been adopted so early. Then you quickly dismiss such thoughts.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 90": "Everything about this situation feels wrong, you know it. As soon as Miss Olga lets go of you, you immediately take off running for the front door!\n\n“Catalina! Stop!” you hear Miss Olga shout, but you ignore her.\n\nFatty Patty is standing near the door stuffing her face and you somehow manage to shove her out of the way, though as you grab the door handle you see her fall to the floor and her head cracking open like a fragile egg causing blood and brains to leak out all over.\n\nShocked by this event, you run out the door as you hear laughter all around you, even as you run down the street, which is starting to look hazy. You need to get to the park. It’s the only place you’ll be safe.\n\nYou run in the direction that you usually go to the park, but it feels like you’re not getting any closer. In fact everything is starting to look unfamiliar. Did you somehow take a wrong turn somewhere in your haste?\n\nYou hear Miss Olga shouting your name, but it doesn’t completely sound like her. In fact the voice is getting deeper and more menacing. It also seems to be all around you.\n\nEventually you see the park, but something is seriously wrong.\n\nYou see the park completely devoid of life. The trees, the bushes, the flowers, even grass are dead. You don’t hear or see any animals either. Not even insects.\n\nThis isn’t how it should be. At least not yet? Was it always like this? You don’t remember it being like this.\n\nSuddenly you feel a hand grip your shoulder, you turn and see Miss Olga except she’s a rotting corpse. It’s pretty startling.\n\n“You wanted to see the grave wings? Well here they are!” Miss Olga exclaims.\n\nAnd then a bunch of them come flying out of Miss Olga’s decayed mouth and straight at you. Everything is purple for a moment then it goes completely black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this. Obviously that wasn’t how your life went though.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 95": "You don’t know what you’re doing and you feel like Miss Olga always knows everything. Even if she doesn’t, she’s going to be able to tell if you’re lying. You still think you’re going to get into trouble, but maybe the truth will at least lessen it.\n\nYou tell Miss Olga everything very reluctantly. You’re on the verge of tears and your voice quivers a bit, but you keep it together. Miss Olga’s eyes widen when you mention magic. In fact she looks concerned until you finish. She remains silent though, which is probably more upsetting to you.\n\nChloe breaks up the silence after you stop talking.\n\n“Miss Olga, it’s not her fault! Please don’t send her to magic jail!” Chloe exclaims.\n“Chloe, calm down. Nobody is going to jail. But…” Miss Olga sighs heavily. “I am not equipped to help you Catalina. I know you’re not some demon spawn or anything like that, but you obviously have a condition that needs people more experienced than I in these matters.”\n“Don’t send her to jail! Please!” Chloe yells again.\n“Chloe, be quiet! I just said I wasn’t going to do that. In fact, YOU leave. I need to speak to Catalina privately. And DON’T tell any of the other children about this, you understand?”\n\nChloe nods and leaves the table slowly, she even hugs you before exiting the room. You’re left alone with Miss Olga and you’re very nervous. Miss Olga shakes her head.\n\n“Catalina, your little night time adventure has really complicated things for your life. But what’s done it done, now it’s my job to at least try to provide help to you, like I always have, contrary to what you might believe.”\n“What are you going to do?”\n“Well I’m going to have to actively find parents for you as soon as possible, fortunately we live in a city that has the most popular magic college in the world. There’s a professor there that can probably help. Haven’t seen her in years, but we were on good terms last time we spoke. More importantly I can trust her. At least I hope I can. Well I’m going to have to in any case.”\n\nYou shift in your chair a bit silently, still worrying about what’s going to happen.\n\n“As for you, you’re going to be sticking to me from now on. You’ll be sleeping in the extra bed in my room until I can find proper parents for you, you will NOT be sneaking away to the park or anywhere else. You are to remain in this building at all times. And you are definitely NOT to practice ANY sort of magic! I catch you doing any of that and Chloe’s concerns about you going away to jail will be a reality. You understand?”\n\nYou tense up and nod rapidly.\n\n“Good. Now get ready for bed.”\n\nYou leave the table and start to exit the room but then turn to tell Miss Olga that you’re sorry. Miss Olga maintains her firm composure, but says she’s at least glad you told her the truth when you did and that as long as you behave, everything will be fine.\n\nAs you start to head to Miss Olga’s room, everything starts to get hazy for some reason. You don’t even remember actually getting into bed, but you’re suddenly there when you wake up.\n\nHow long have you been asleep?\n\nYour time at the orphanage seems to be a blur. You’re playing with Chloe one moment and you’re eating at the table the next. It’s all sort of mundane and even a little boring.\n\nYou briefly think about sneaking off to the park, but you’re too afraid now. Not to mention Chloe is always around you now. Is she spying on you for Miss Olga?\n\nYou don’t know how much time passes, maybe a week? You do remember seeing an older lady come into the orphanage to speak to Miss Olga. She had completely white hair and walked with a cane. She had to be even older than Miss Olga. Strange you can’t remember her face even though you spoke to her.\n\nYou get called in and answered a few questions about your magic abilities. The older lady asks, though you can’t really understand any of what she says. You still can’t make out her face either.\n\nYou mostly answer in a yes or no way or repeat what you were able to do. The lady casts some sort of magic and then speaks to Miss Olga. You can’t understand what she says, but Miss Olga nods and seems relieved.\n\nShe turns to you.\n\n“Catalina, you’re going to go stay here another week and then you will meet your new parents. They will be able to help you and train you in the way you need. Until then, just continue to stay in the building and behave okay?” Miss Olga says.\n“Yes, Miss Olga.” You answer.\n\nYou are told to go play, which you do. Chloe asks what happened, but you can’t really explain well. Everything is just hard to focus on. You tell Chloe that nothing happened and that you just need to go lie down.\n\nAgain, you aren’t sure how long you sleep. Has it been days? You just know that something important is happening.\n\nMiss Olga comes in and tells you that your new parents are here and they’re eager to meet you. You aren’t so eager to meet them though.\n\nThey come in and your attitude changes. You see two well dressed figures and at first you can’t make out their faces until they get closer and that’s when you see them clearly.\n\nBoth of them have grinning fleshless skulls rather than faces. Their skeletal arms extend to embrace you and you are filled with a sense of safe familiarity. You waste no time in hugging your new parents, then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this. Obviously that wasn’t how your life went. It was sort of a comforting image though and you briefly wonder how different things would have been if you’d been adopted so early. Then you quickly dismiss such thoughts.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be?

  "page 94": "After a couple weeks of sneaking to the park and recreating your “discovery” on various plants and flowers there, you learn that it doesn’t seem to be going away.\n\nYou think maybe it’s due to the grave wings biting you and it could very well be, but you don’t really know. In fact, you haven’t seen the grave wings at all since that last night you fell unconscious.\n\nWhile you’ve never been there, you do know that this city has one of the most important magic schools in the world. (Well at least what little you know of it). You once remember seeing someone performing magic in the park for a crowd until a guard ran him off saying how he wasn’t allowed off school grounds.\n\nYour knowledge is very limited on how this works or even why, but you can only come to the simple conclusion that you must have magic abilities!\n\nWhile this is exciting, even you’re aware of how dangerous magic can be. You aren’t sure if you should tell Miss Olga or not. If you did maybe you’d go to the magic school?\n\nWhile you’re thinking on this, you aren’t paying too much attention to what you’ve been doing to the flowers nearby.\n\n“By the gods!” you hear a voice exclaim.\n\nYou look down and see dead flowers near your hand, then you look where the voice came from and see Chloe standing nearby in shock. You’re a little surprised as well since you’ve been careful to not let anyone see.\n\nAll you can utter is:\n\n“Wha…what are you doing here?”\n“Miss Olga told me to come get you for lunch since she knows I’d be able to find you quicker than she would…you made those flowers wilt!” Chloe says readdressing the situation.\n“Shhh! You’re the only one who knows so far!” you say.\n“I am? When did you become magical? Wait, was it after that night?”\n“Yeah.”\n\nYou fully expect Chloe to get scared, but instead she’s curious.\n\n“Well…what else can you do? Can you create a fireball?” she asks.\n“No. I mean…well I dunno. I haven’t tried it.” You say.\n“So, you can only kill flowers?”\n“No, I can make them better too, look.”\n\nYou focus a bit and the dead flowers show some vigor again, but not much.\n\n“They still look in pretty bad shape.” Chloe says.\n“Yeah, I can never get them to go exactly back to how they were. I keep trying, but it doesn’t seem to work.” You reply.\n“Well…maybe you need to practice?”\n“I have for a week now, but it’s not like I can practice for long periods of time.”\n\nAfter saying this to Chloe, you notice something on the ground by some of the dead flower petals. It’s a dead bee. You guess you didn’t notice it when you were near the flowers before, but you can only guess it was in one of the flowers you wilted and as a result, you killed it too.\n\nYou get an idea…\n\n“What are you doing now?” Chloe asks.\n“This bee. I think I killed it, when I wilted the flowers. I’m going to see if I can make it better.”\n“What? You…you can’t do that!”\n“Why not? I can bring back flowers…well sorta. Anyway it’s worth a shot.”\n“I dunno Cat, this seems like a bad idea. Couldn’t you just try to change that rose purple or something?”\n\nYou ignore Chloe’s concerns and focus on the bee.\n\nAnd focus…\n\nAnd focus…\n\n“I don’t think it’s working.”\n“Shhh!”\n\nYou focus again and after feeling a bit light headed, you see it! You see a wing move, if only for a brief moment! Chloe sees it too and now she’s scared.\n\n“You…you shouldn’t be able to do that.” Chloe remarks.\n“Why?” you ask.\n“Because…that’s like against the rules! Don’t you know that story?”\n“Story about what?”\n“About the Great Lich Lord and how he nearly conquered the world with the dead!”\n“I don’t remember Miss Olga telling that story before.”\n“You probably were here in the park as usual, but last year she told a scary story about him and why that sort of magic is against the rules. You can get into a lot of trouble doing it.”\n“Oh. Well I’m not doing that. I’m just seeing if I can revive this bee.”\n“I think that’s the same thing Cat! Come on, we need to get back anyway for lunch.”\n\nReluctantly you leave with Chloe and head back to the orphanage where you’re already late. Fatty Patty wastes no time in calling attention to that fact when you both try to quietly go to your chairs in the dinning room. The other children don’t say anything, but of course…\n\n“Miss Olga! Cat and Chloe are late!” Patty shouts obnoxiously while partially eaten food crumbs fly out of her mouth.\n\nMiss Olga comes out of the kitchen frowning, but she seems more annoyed by Patty than you two since it was already obvious you were going to be late.\n\n“Well I see you two finally decided to join us. I told you to get Catalina a half hour ago. What happened Chloe, you get lost on the way?” Miss Olga asks.\n“No Miss Olga.” Chloe says looking down.\n“And as for you, well I’m getting to the point I can see you’re just determined to be difficult even after your recent episode. Both of you go take your seats at the table.”\n\nYou and Chloe silently take your seats while Patty and a couple other children snicker. The other children finish before you and Chloe since you came in late, that’s when Chloe speaks again.\n\n“You going to tell Miss Olga?” Chloe asks.\n“Huh? Tell her what?” you ask.\n“About your magic powers. You probably should since she’ll know what to do.”\n“What? No! I don’t want to tell her, I’ll get in trouble!”\n“Maybe, but I mean magic is serious, you can’t just keep it secret!”\n\n“Keep what secret?” Miss Olga asks staring at the pair of you. Obviously she only heard the last part, but she knows something’s up.\n\nYou feel anxious. Part of you does want to tell her since you really don’t know what you’re doing, but you feel like you’re going to get locked away forever if you say something.\n",
  "page 96": "You are NOT going to risk telling Miss Olga anything, but you’re struggling to think of what to say.\n\n“Um…” you say.\n“Well?” Miss Olga asks as Chloe looks at you.\n“I…well…okay…I found a rabbit in the park and it was so friendly it let me pet and play with it. That’s why Chloe was late, since she was playing with it too.”\n“Um…yeah…it was soft and fluffy.” Chloe stammers.\n“I was going to try to go back and get it to sneak it in here since I didn’t think you’d let me keep it.”\n\nMiss Olga looks at you and at Chloe and gives a side eye to both of you, like she isn’t sure if you’re telling the truth, but ultimately she does believe you.\n\n“Well you’re certainly right that I wouldn’t allow you to keep it. We don’t have the space to shelter pets and I won’t have one pooping all over the place. Still, I’m glad that you admitted the truth to me. Shows you aren’t completely delinquent. A bit unusual that a rabbit would willingly come up to you though. Usually they are timid creatures.”\n\nYou and Chloe say nothing to this statement.\n\n“Bah, probably something to do with that magic college, never know what’s going on there. That’s why I want you to stay close by; I don’t drag you from that park because I like being mean. I just want you to be safe. Do you understand?”\n“Yes, Miss Olga.” You respond.\n“Hm. Of course you understand. I think you always have, but you’re determined to be stubborn. I know you don’t like it here, and that’s why if you behave better you’ll be more likely to get out of here quicker and go to a proper family that can provide a better life for you.”\n\nAgain you don’t say anything and just eat your food, Chloe follows your example, while Miss Olga just shakes her head and tells the pair of you to stay inside for the rest of the day, especially since it’ll be getting dark soon.\n\nYou and Chloe both obey and go back to your room which is empty since the rest of the children are playing outside or elsewhere. Last thing they want to do is be around their beds if they don’t have to sleep.\n\nChloe hasn’t said anything, though given that she didn’t tell on you, you do appreciate it.\n\n“Thanks for not telling Miss Olga.” You say.\n“…you’re welcome…but what are you going to do now?” Chloe slowly says.\n“I dunno. All my practice isn’t working. Maybe I need a magic book.”\n“Aren’t those all at the college?”\n“They can’t all be in there. It’s too far from us anyway. Have a hard enough time sneaking off to the park. Hm. Hey, wait there’s a bookstore a few blocks from the park on Conjure Street. Maybe they would have something.”\n“They sell used books don’t they?”\n“Yeah so? Still might have something.”\n“I mean you don’t have any money, how are you going to buy it?”\n“I dunno. I guess I could…”\n\nChloe already knows what you’re going say.\n\n“No. You can’t seriously be thinking about stealing a book!” Chloe says.\n“Actually I was considering taking Miss Olga’s coin purse and buying the book.”\n\nChloe looks at you in disbelief.\n\n“That…that’s even worse!” she exclaims.\n\nWhile stealing from someone you know is worse than stealing from a stranger is debatable, you were just thinking it would be easier to steal from Miss Olga since you know where her coin purse is.\n\nWhile you’re pondering if it wouldn’t be quicker to directly steal a book, you hear a familiar annoying voice.\n\n“What are you two doing in here together? Probably planning to sneak out again like you did before! You know if you do that again, Miss Olga will just send you both to that place for bad kids. You both will probably go there anyway. Especially you pig face!” Patty says.\n“Shut up Patty! Nobody was talking to you!” Chloe snaps.\n“I’m telling Miss Olga, you called me a name!”\n\nPatty runs out the room, leaving you and Chloe alone again.\n\n“Ugh. I hate her. I know the rest of the kids don’t like me, but Patty always makes it worse.” Chloe says.\n\nYou nod and agree that Patty is indeed very annoying and go back to pondering what you’re going to do about advancing your magic situation. Chloe of course still is advising you against any sort of stealing, so whatever it is you ultimately decide, you’ll probably have to do it without Chloe’s help.\n",
  "page 150": "Yes. You can still have him, why deny yourself and put yourself through any excessive pain? Besides, now he’s attractive in a whole new way.\n\nYou waste no time and cast a preservation spell on him, then raise him back from the dead.\n\nHis eyes open and he stares at you. There is nothing behind the eyes but devotion to your commands now. Your mood improves and your previous sadness soon disappears.\n\nHowever, there’s a very brief feeling of unease as his dead eyes stare through you. You dismiss this though as this being a bit of an unusual situation.\n\nThe first thing on the agenda is gathering members of the Dark Order and establish who is in charge now.\n\nYour announcement is met with surprise. Nobody opposes your rule for various reasons. Most of them due to figuring if you took out Azrael, then you must be even more powerful and they aren’t in any hurry to challenge you. (You naturally left out the exact details of how you managed it) The other minor reason is you did train most of them and you were in the Dark Order a lot longer than Azrael, so they’re a little more comfortable around you anyway.\n\nWith the new hierarchy in place, your next problem is a bit more concerning. When you killed Azrael, you lost just a little less than half of your undead army. You didn’t really realize just how much necromantic power he was using to upkeep it. In fact Dark Order some members were running around trying to figure out what happened since they saw whole platoons suddenly just collapse.\n\nNot long after the initial collapse however something odd happened which is some of the dead had arisen again and stayed put. Nobody knows why this happened with some of the dead and not others, as there didn’t seem to be a reason.\n\nYou silently have a theory that perhaps by bringing Azrael back to life, some of his lingering necromantic energy allowed for saving some of your losses. Good thing you decided to keep him around, not just for your own personal reasons.\n\nStill, you have lost a significant amount of your army. You still have enough of an army to defend Aftermath, but Azrael’s plans of expanding aren’t going to be happening anytime soon. Not that you had any major desire to expand since that was more his idea than yours.\n\nAnd yet…\n\nThere’s a part of you that realizes you do need to expand if you’re really going to cow the Grand Alliance and the rest of your enemies into submission. You just need more troops to do so.\n\nAnd you’ll get those from the Ghoul King. You’re still not exactly keen on the alliance that Azrael set up with the Ghoul King, but since it’s already in motion, you might as well keep up the arrangement. You’ll have to go meet with him though because obviously you need to establish the fact that you are just as powerful as Azrael was. Hessan is still stationed there as well, so you need to update him as well.\n\nBelial is the most competent so you leave him in charge while you personally go to the Drozz wasteland. You also visit with Azrael in your bedroom before leaving.\n\n“I’ll be fine. I know I don’t like leaving the city, but this is important right? You set this up and the least I can do is see to it that it wasn’t in vain, especially since we need the extra support right now.” You say.\n\nAzrael doesn’t answer.\n\n“I know, I know, I’ll be careful. I’ve dealt with vampires before. Stop worrying so much about me. I’ll be back before you know it and we can spend some time together. Okay?”\n\nAzrael still doesn’t answer, but you give him a kiss goodbye.\n\nYour meeting with the Ghoul King and Hessan is surprising to both of them. Hessan especially since he’s now under a new leadership, but isn’t going to oppose you.\n\nThe Ghoul King is a different situation. One odd thing is his face keeps mildly changing. It’s like his face is a blur. You think he’s hairless with red eyes, but other details are sketchy.\n\nHe mentions why should he have faith in an idea of an alliance with the Dark Order if its leader could be killed and replaced so easily.\n\nYou point out that you are better necromancer otherwise you wouldn’t have been able to overthrow Azrael in the first place, you then say you can prove your claim by doing what Azrael said he would be able to do, which is raise a giant from the dead.\n\nThe Ghoul King is impressed by your confidence enough and says he has a few giant corpses laying around and if you are as powerful as you claim then the alliance will stay.\n\nYou’ve never done this before, but you feel confident that you can do it. In fact, the whole time you’ve been outside the walls of the city, you haven’t even experienced any anxiety. It’s like something within you has changed.\n\nIt requires all your focus and your nose starts bleeding and you feel incredibly drained afterwards, but you manage to raise a single giant back from the dead. The huge creature stands attention waiting for your commands. Hessan and even the Ghoul King look on in amazement by your powers.\n\nWith this great show of power, you keep the alliance in place and plan on raising more giants to eventually expand to take the Brot Kingdom.\n\nYou return home exhausted, but filled with a new confidence that you made the right decision. You immediately go to your bedroom.\n\n“Azrael, I told you I’d be back and everything went well! I believe in a few months we should be able to expand to take the Brot Kingdom and finally take out that asshole Trelik for good.”\n\nAzrael says nothing and embrace him tightly.\n\n“I couldn’t have done this without you. I think it’s time to consummate our relationship officially.” You say casting a spell on Azrael to do just that.\n\nTwo years pass and it’s all been a blur of the events that have happened.\n\nYour attempts at expansion were never quite successful. You just never had enough troops to take the Brot Kingdom, even with the few giants you managed to raise.\n\nThe Grand Alliance always fucked up your plans to keep you and Trelik weak. Eventually you had to pull back and just focus on defense. Which was just as well since vampire assassins attempted to murder you on several occasions, though the last attack focused on some of the other necromancers to wear down your defenses.\n\nReally though, those are the least of your problems.\n\nEver since you raised Azrael back, your mind has grown increasingly erratic. At first everything seemed on the upswing, but with things getting worse, you haven’t been feeling yourself.\n\nYou talk to Azrael whenever you get the chance now. He doesn’t actually respond back, but you feel like he does. Like he’s communicating to you on some faint level through your mind. You frequently go from asking for advice to blaming everything on him to apologizing and making up physically with him. It’s a vicious cycle and one you can’t even easily break now, because his mere presence is upkeeping a lot of defenses.\n\nAnd you hate him for it or at least you would if you didn’t love him so much.\n\nYour behavior hasn’t gone unnoticed by the rest of the Dark Order. They often hear you ranting on occasion to seemingly nobody, but they do hear the name Azrael being mentioned sometimes and rumors are soon whispered.\n\nAnother year passes and you barely come out of your bedroom anymore, just spending all your time with Azrael. (Which isn’t a secret any longer)\n\nBelial and Hessan both came to you saying that you needed to become more active again as the Grand Alliance now has taken out Trelik and armies are starting to march on Aftermath directly. Even the Ghoul King has not been lending his ghouls as assistance as he once was.\n\nYou didn’t listen to them though; you just demanded to be left alone and even killed Belial in the process.\n\nThis act was enough for Hessan to gather up the rest of the Dark Order and just leave Aftermath. He didn’t think he could oppose you even with more numbers, but he sure wasn’t going to stick around anymore.\n\nYou didn’t care or even notice though. Now you had even more time alone with Azrael.\n\nBut that time wouldn’t be for long as more vampire assassins easily entered Aftermath and confronted you.\n\nYou manage to hold your own for a while, but during the attack, Azrael’s body takes several throwing blades to the body, one even decapitating him.\n\nYou scream out in anguish and this temporary distraction is all one of the vampires needs to sneak up behind you and everything going black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nYou know this didn’t happen. In fact you’re almost distressed by this experience, not due to dying as you’ve been there before, but the fact that you not only killed your beloved, but that you went completely mad in the process. You can’t imagine just losing so much control like that, but if you really did hang on like that, you suppose it could very well happen that you’d lose yourself.\n\nIn fact, it almost seems impossible that such a scenario could have happened. However, everyone has those dark thoughts even towards those they love and there was a very brief time when you did ponder the possibility.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 154": "A lot of conflict between the various factions for a few years after you and Azrael made things official. It’s mostly been a stalemate, but you’re hoping that may change pretty quickly.\n\nAzrael just eliminated Velzix and currently is on another mission to eliminate the Vampire Clans. That will definitely be a relief if only to put an end to their continued assassination attempts.\n\nYou sort of wonder if Azrael should have rushed in to attack them so quickly after taking care of Velzix. You got the impression that allying with his dad who then died during the mission had an effect on him. Maybe he should have taken at least a day or so to rest.\n\nAzrael could still stand to plan things out a bit more rather than making impulsive decisions all the time. You’re just glad he managed to get better at other forms of magic with your help though. Never hurts to have more than one tool even if one does favor a hammer most of the time.\n\nHowever, you’ve learned to trust Azrael’s judgment a bit more so if he wants to do something he usually can handle it. His decision to ally with the Ghoul King seems to have worked out as it lead to finding out the hideout of the Vampire Clans.\n\nWith Azrael gone you keep up the usual routine of maintaining the defenses of Aftermath and such. You haven’t had a major direct attack by the Alliance in at least a year or so though.\n\nAfter going through the standard procedures, you retire to your garden to relax a bit. You’ve also been trying to compensate for the lack of certain elements in your undead symphony by having banshee voices fill in for particular instruments. So far things could be better, but you figure eventually you should get at least a few of them to emulate flutes or piccolos.\n\nWhile you’re attempting to get one of the banshees to shriek at a slightly lower tone, you sense a presence that immediately causes you raise your defenses.\n\n“Hello Catalina, at last we meet.” A woman before you says.\n\nThe woman looks about your age and is dressed in black with a pale appearance. It’s fairly obvious she’s a vampire, but there’s something more about her. Familiar somehow.\n\n“Like looking into a mirror isn’t it?” the woman says.\n“Not sure what you mean, but the only thing I’m looking at is another soon to be dead leech. How many are there this time?” you reply.\n“Just me. It was decided that perhaps you could be reasoned with and that you would not need to be destroyed like your mate.”\n“That’s amusing since that’s what he’s on his way to do to you lot.”\n“I don’t think so. As we speak, your mate has most likely already been dispatched by Lord Rostov. You need not join him though…you really don’t realize who I am do you?”\n“Nope, and in a moment it won’t matter.”\n“I suppose if I hadn’t given you up as a baby, we wouldn’t be here now.”\n\nThe woman stares at you after saying these words and then you realize what she’s implying.\n\n“Bullshit. You’re not her.” You say.\n“Oh? And how would you know exactly? You’ve never seen me before, however you see me now and I KNOW you see a resemblance. Hell, I see the resemblance in you. You look very much like I did when I was your age; well I suppose I still look like you, a cup size bigger though.”\n“So, I’m supposed to just believe you’re my mother? Where’s my father then?”\n“I dunno, it was a wild party that night. I’m going to guess though he must have been a wizard of some sort given that I met him here at a party. Hell maybe when he got older he was even one of the faculty you killed. Wouldn’t that be something?”\n“Yes it would be quite a twist of fate. Just like my mother suddenly showing up after all these years as a vampire would be quite a twist of fate. Speaking of which, are you going to tell me I’m actually part vampire too?”\n“No, of course not. Vampires can’t reproduce, well not in the usual way anyway. Thank the gods for that, because once was enough for me. I was bitten not long after I gave you up. Similar frat party but got luckier with the choice of man that time. He was fun for awhile, showed me all sorts of things, but eventually we parted ways. Just glad he wasn’t possessive, I might’ve been really fucked with him being my creator and all.”\n“Judging from what little you’ve said to me, it sounds like you were used to going through life getting fucked. Probably was for the best that you gave me up.”\n\nThe woman’s eyes narrow.\n\n“Catalina, look I can’t make up for abandoning you, but I’m trying to save your existence now. The Clans are going to put an end to your lover, but YOU can still live forever!”\n“What? By becoming one you?”\n“Why not? Catalina, you’re a sensible woman and you have great skill. You have so many traits that would be highly valued by the Clans. You would have access to anything you desired, live lifetimes, and most importantly you’d look as beautiful as you are now.”\n“I already have all that I want.”\n\nThe woman looks around and waves her arms in the air, pointing at your nearby banshees, skeletons and rotting garden.\n\n“What, this? THIS is truly all you want? You’re surrounded by death. There is nothing here but a gloomy parody of life. Have you even left this city since you destroyed it? What are you afraid of Catalina? There is SO much to see and do outside these walls. There is so much of life to experience” the woman says.\n“The irony of a vampire lecturing me about being surrounded by death and experiencing life is…well it’s something.” you respond.\n“Catalina, I’m really trying here.”\n“Well you’re failing really badly at trying to convince me that you’re really my mother, let alone join your little vampire club.”\n“I see. What if I could prove that I’m your mother? Will you at least hear me out a little more?”\n\nThe woman looks at you with hope in her eyes and a concerned expression, like she really wants you to at least give her a chance.\n",
  "page 153": "Your mind goes back to the discussion you had with Azrael after finally consummating your relationship. Seems a very minor thing to remember compared to what happened in your life, but then it was certainly a milestone moment.\n\n“How many girls did you have before me?” you suddenly ask as you lie next to Azrael.\n“What? Why?” he answers very surprised and probably shaking him out of his afterglow from your intimacy.\n“Oh, I remember you saying you had a girlfriend in high school, but I assume there might have been others. It doesn’t matter if you did. I was just wondering about your experience in this matter compared to mine. Wasn’t sure how knowledgeable you were.”\n“Well, I did have a few encounters with girls in college, but they weren’t really girlfriends…wait. Experience…knowledge…you were satisfied right?” Azrael asks.\n\nAzrael sits up worrying what you might be getting at, though he’s overreacting since he made it about himself, though perhaps he was genuinely concerned about your contentment. Either way, it’s mildly amusing since it’s not even remotely what you were implying.\n\n“Yes, it was pleasurable, granted I don’t have much to compare to.” You answer.\n“Hold on, nothing else to compare to? Are you saying you never did this before? You’re a virgin?” Azrael asks.\n“I wouldn’t go that far, but let’s just say you’re a bit different than my previous rare experiences.”\n“Hm. Would have figured you would have had a lot of suitors…oh fuck…I don’t mean it like that…I just mean…”\n“I know what you meant. Relax. You need to enjoy this moment more and not worry so much, you won me over obviously.”\n\nAs Azrael looks a bit relieved as you continue to speak.\n\n“But to get back to what you said, yeah I did have quite a few try, but they failed to get very far. I sort of stayed away from people though, so it wasn’t excessively an issue until I joined the Dark Order. The demonologist lot always seemed to be perpetually horny and I think you’re well aware of our fellow necromancers at the time. Before you got here, I was involved in a constant battle for my affections with Trelik and Sebastian.”\n“Yeah I’m not surprised about those two. Not surprised you weren’t interested in either. Trelik was an arrogant asshole and Sebastian was a hideous hunchback.”\n“While you are correct about what made Trelik unappealing, Sebastian’s looks weren’t what put him out of the running. He had many positive qualities, but his lack of confidence is what did him in. He really tried, but it just wasn’t enough.”\n“You almost sound sad about it.”\n“Not really. Well, more pity than sad. As I said, he had many positive qualities and I imagine I was the closest thing he saw as perfection. It’s never a good idea to put someone on an unobtainable pedestal and its part of why I would never see him as worthy. Still… I suppose I could have fucked him once. Not like I was doing anything important at the time.”\n\nAzrael chuckles a bit at the last part of your comment, though you weren’t really trying to be funny.\n\n“Well it’s true, I mean I could somewhat sympathize with Sebastian since I wasn’t much better considering I had a stupid crush on Mr. Demar.” You say.\n“Wait, hold on. Really?” Azrael exclaims.\n“Oh yes. I found many traits of his very attractive.”\n“So did you and he…”\n“No. Never got past the crush stage and I never told him. Hardly would have mattered if I had since he liked boys instead.”\n“Truly?”\n“Yeah. Had a relationship with Irwin.”\n“Huh, didn’t know that. So what was it about him? You like older guys?”\n“Mm, not so much that, though they do tend to be more knowledgeable and have more experience in things, like magic for example. Mr. Demar wasn’t perfect, but I do think he ran the Dark Order at the time fairly well in secret.”\n“Ah, so power then.”\n“Power?”\n“Yeah, you’re attracted to power and confident men who know what they want.”\n“Well…yes I suppose that’s part of it, but that’s not really it either. I mean if that was the case, I could have just fucked some ambitious royal or something. Hell, one guy I was potentially going to go with turned out to practically be a vagabond, but he certainly had that aura that really set him apart.”\n“Oh? Who was this?”\n“Some vampire.”\n“Vampire?!”\n“Yeah, I think his name was Alec or something. I dunno. I killed him when he started getting too predatory. Sort of my own damn fault for trying to fuck a vampire.”\n\nAt this point Azrael is learning things about you that he never even considered before, but he’s not getting upset so much as he seems more in shock than anything else.\n\nThough there’s a bit of confusion as well.\n\n“What’s wrong?” you ask.\n“Well, I’m confused at this point. From the sound of it, you’re fairly picky and you claim you aren’t a virgin, so I’m wondering who the hell managed to woo you before I came along…wait…you weren’t…” Azrael says before you interrupt.\n“Ah no. Not that there weren’t rape attempts by various unsavory sorts in the past. But to clear up your confusion, nobody wooed me as you say. I finally just decided to get it over with someone I wouldn’t have any attachments to and had at least one of the major traits I found attractive.”\n“So who was it?”\n“I dunno. Some idiot frat guy that died doing something stupid. He was fresh enough for my purposes. Kept him for awhile until I got bored and disposed of him.”\n\nIt takes a moment, but Azrael suddenly gets what you mean.\n\n“You fucked a corpse?” Azrael asks.\n“Well I mean I used necromancy to get him ready. Wouldn’t have been much good to me just lying there. I imagine you guys have an easier time of it, not even needing to reanimate the body and all.” You respond.\n“I wouldn’t know. I never did that.”\n“You didn’t? Huh. Figured all necromancers did at some point. I know damn well Sebastian had to be doing it, and I’m sure others have as well. You said your high school girlfriend died right?”\n“Yeah. Why?”\n“Well I mean didn’t you…”\n“What? No! First of all I didn’t even know any necromancy at that point being a late bloomer and all. Second, she was cremated and even if she hadn’t been, that seems like it would have been disrespectful to her memory.”\n“Aww, you’re so thoughtful aren’t you? Just so you know, I’d be fine with it.” you say cuddling next to him.\n\nAzrael looks over at you as if he still can’t quite grasp something.\n\n“Is there a problem? Surely you’re not jealous of a corpse.” You say.\n“No, but I’m still trying to figure out what about me ultimately won you over.” Azrael responds.\n“Does it matter?”\n“I guess not.”\n“Still, you’re curious. I’ll just say it’s obviously a combination of several things, but one thing you have more than anyone else is a powerful deathly aura. It even exceeds the dead itself somehow. It’s quite intoxicating at times.”\n“So…fucking me is basically like fucking a dead man, is that what you’re saying?”\n“Well no, it’s better because we can talk afterwards, like we’re doing now.”\n\nAzrael starts laughing, but once again you were serious. He sure has an odd sense of humor, but you love him.\n",
  "page 133": "Fuck it. You’re just going to do it. There’s no safe way to fuck a vampire and tonight that’s exactly what you’ve decided to do.\n\n“Look Alec, you said you’re just passing through and you’re not looking for dinner, you’re looking to get laid right?” you ask.\n“Well…yes, but…” Alec says before you interrupt.\n“Good, so am I. So let’s drop all the getting to know you stuff and just get to it. You got a place we can go to? Can’t really go back to mine, I live with a bunch of other people and you showing up might cause issues.”\n“Yes, I have place.”\n“Good, let’s get out of here then.”\n\nYou stand up first and start walking out the door; Alec soon catches up saying to wait up.\n\nAlec soon takes the lead and it doesn’t take long before the pair of you are heading to the city graveyard. You can’t say you’re too surprised.\n\n“Graveyard? Seems a bit on the nose doesn’t it?” you say.\n“Heh, don’t worry, we won’t be out in the open. There’s a crypt this way I use when I’m in town, this way.”\n\nYou follow Alec to the crypt and after a walk down some stairs and through a few catacombs; you eventually reach a well “kept” area with a fancy coffin. You look around and see despite the bricked interior of the room; nature is still finding a way inside as several large tree roots are breaking through the old weakened brick.\n\n“You might want to be careful with where your coffin’s location is Alec, a tree could come crashing down on it.” You say.\n“Yeah, this place has seen better days, but I certainly call it home when I’m here. Really need to do something about the grave wings flying about the catacombs though. I don’t remember there being so many before. Ugh, there’s even a few in here.”\n“You don’t like them? I’ve always thought they were pretty.”\n“Hm, maybe that’s because they don’t bite you.”\n“I didn’t see them bite you when we were walking down here.”\n“They usually don’t, but…well given a vampire’s state of existence and what grave wings typically feast on and let’s just say the occasional curious or hungry one isn’t adverse to nipping one of my kind occasionally.”\n“Heh, I guess I can see why that would make you a little apprehensive with a large number of them around. So…should I just take my clothes off and get in the coffin then?”\n“Sheesh, you work fast for someone who’s never done this before.”\n\nYou stay silent in your response, but Alec answers for you.\n\n“I know you’re a virgin Catalina. I can smell your purity.”\n“Excuse me? Just because I’m a necromancer doesn’t mean I’m forego bath…”\n“No, no, no, it’s your blood. The blood never lies.” Alec interrupts.\n“How would those two things even…nevermind, guessing it’s one of your vamp powers. So that another reason you were drawn to me? Like ‘em fresh huh?”\n“And you like the dead.”\n\nYou notice Alec’s staring at you intently during your conversation and you catch yourself looking directly at him and look away.\n\n“Y’know intimacy is going to be very difficult if you’re going to insist on not looking at me. You going to keep your eyes closed the entire time? That’s no way to experience your first time.” Alec remarks.\n“Well how about you just lift up my dress and bend me over your coffin then? That way I’ll be able to keep my eyes open the entire time. I would have thought someone of your years would be a little more imaginative in various sexual positions.” you answer.\n“Oh trust me, I could get very imaginative with such things…but since you’re insistent on being so blunt, I suppose I might as well do the same.”\n\nAlec stands up a bit straighter and you feel a decidedly different demeanor. A more predatory one.\n\n“So. You were looking for prey after all.” You say backing away.\n“No, actually I wasn’t. As I said, I already ate before I entered the Alkymist. However, I am in need of companionship.” Alec says.\n“I thought that’s what we were going to do.”\n“Mm, yes but I would like a more permanent arrangement. You see, I’m starting to get to a point in my existence where I would like to share it with someone. Who better than a necromancer?”\n“I’m flattered, but I just don’t feel I’m ready to make such a commitment. I can see this was a bad idea. I’ll just be going…” you say, but before you can step past him, he moves to block the doorway.\n\nThe true colors are showing.\n\n“Come now. While I know you avoided giving too much away about yourself. Even I can tell how drawn you are to death. Why be a necromancer dabbling with death when you could literally be the embodiment of it? Just think of the new places you could go and things you could do. That WE could do. You’d achieve what necromancers often only dream of. Immortality. And you’d remain as beautiful as you are now.”\n\nWhile you’re realizing what a terrible idea this was, you’re also just mentally shaking your head at the fact that you not only pick a vampire, but you pick one that wants you to spend the rest of eternity with him.\n\nThis might even be romantic if it was under different circumstances.\n\n“Honeyed words, and let’s say you’re telling the truth. Wouldn’t you have power over me as my creator?”\n“I would never abuse such power.”\n“You’re abusing it right now.”\n“How?”\n“By not letting me leave! You’re attempting to intimidate me into going along with your plan without a fuss. Look, if you really do desire me the way you say you do, then let me leave and at least let me think about your proposal.”\n\nAlec’s eyes begin to turn a darker red and while he still keeps his distance, he’s obviously attempting to hold back his anger.\n\n“And have you disappear completely because you let fear limit you? You’re telling me you didn’t come here expecting something like this to happen? Did you really believe we were going to just have sex and part ways? You’re either very stupid…which I don’t believe, OR more likely THIS is something you really want but are too scared to make that final step. Trust me Catalina, there is nothing to fear.”\n“Alright Alec, just stay back.” You say noticing he’s starting to walk towards you.\n“Catalina, I’m faster than you are. I could easily reach you before you could even get off a spell. You know this. It won’t hurt I’ll be gentle as possible I promise.”\n“Alec, last chance to back off…”\n“I don’t want to hurt you, but you’re making me do this.”\n“Same.”\n\nAnd just as Alec locks his gaze on you and is about to lunge for your throat, he stops when he sees a thick piece of dead wood coming through his chest. You’d been manipulating the roots coming through the crypt’s bricks as soon as he started blocking the doorway. He makes a few hissing sounds then his whole body goes limp causing the weight of it to break the rest of the root as he falls to the stone floor.\n\nYou step aside and take a look at Alec as he remains impaled through the back and unmoving. You’re curious to as why he’s paralyzed and not outright dead though since you see his eyes still moving.\n\n“Hm, I guess I only nicked your heart huh? Damn, I meant to kill you instantly. Ah well.”\n\nYou step away looking at his body.\n\n“Well I can’t leave you like this. I already did one stupid thing tonight and I’m not about to do a second one leaving a pissed off vampire alive. Especially one a bit obsessed with me.”\n\nYou figure the quick way would be to just manipulate the piece of wood already in his chest though that seems a bit too quick now. Dragging him to the surface so he can explode in the sun might be fitting, but it also could cause attention.\n\nYou briefly look around room for a moment and then smile when you realize Alec and yourself aren’t the only ones in here.\n\nNormally you don’t attempt to control living animals with your nature magic skills, but you don’t think the gravewings will mind.\n\nYou first call the ones in the room to land on Alec. They immediately start biting his ear. Soon your chant calls forth many more of them from the catacombs. In fact there’s enough of them that they resemble a glowing green ball of light. The swarm descends on Alec’s body for a big feast.\n\n“Y’know Alec, it really didn’t have to end this way. I wouldn’t have disappeared on you, I really would have thought about your proposal because I can even admit; there was a large appeal to it. I can’t say for certain if I would have said yes, but because you couldn’t have just been a little more patient, neither of us will ever know. What I do know though, is I won’t be trusting your kind in the future and you won’t be having a future.”\n\nWhat follows next is you watching Alec slowly being eaten alive as he remains in his fixed prone position. He can’t scream, but his eyes are darting back and forth the entire time he watches the hungry insects eat his flesh. Well at least until they start eating his eyes.\n\nOf course it would take a few days for the gravewings to eat a body as big as Alec’s (the poor things can’t possibly eat it all in one sitting) so eventually you do end Alec’s torment and manipulate another root to go through his chest, this one going directly through his heart, at which point he exploded into a heap of gore, though given that part of him was eaten anyway there’s not as much as there would have been.\n\nWith little else here for you, you leave the crypt only to find that dawn is breaking.\n\n“Another day, and still as chaste as the day I was born. Which ever that one was.” You say to yourself and head back to the college.\n\nWhen you get back you bump into Sebastian in the hallway.\n\n“You’re up early.” Sebastian says.\n“Eh, didn’t really sleep. I was busy with…a new spell.” You answer.\n“Oh really? What is it?”\n“Nothing important really. Just a little experiment with nature magic and necromancy.”\n“I think you really are the first one to mix such divergent branches of magic.”\n“And I still don’t think they’re that opposite from each other. Everything living eventually dies, that’s certainly part of nature. It’s all part of the cycle. It’s just nobody sees the beauty in death like they do in nature.”\n“I suppose not, but beauty is everywhere. Well in any case some new corpses came in. Some idiots apparently died playing the mystery potion game at last night’s Manticore House party. A rarity we get bodies so fresh to practice necromancy on.”\n“Indeed. Oh, are you familiar with a vampire by the name of Alec? Looks about late twenties to early thirties, black hair, pale, on the handsome side of looks.”\n“That could describe most vampires from what I’ve seen of some of the reps from the vampire clans. Can’t remember one called Alec though. You meet one or something?”\n“You could say that, though he claimed he was independent of the clans.”\n“Also possible. Well in any case you better tell Mr. Demar as soon as possible just in case.”\n“Okay.”\n“Oh, probably not now though, I think he’s still sleeping in with Irwin.”\n“Wait…Irwin? You mean Mr. Demar is…”\n“Yeah. You really didn’t know?”\n“No, why would I? I barely remember Irwin is even here most of the time. And Trelik implied Felsa routinely slept with Mr. Demar.”\n“And he also implied the same nasty rumor about you and that wasn’t true either right? Trelik’s an idiot who only pays attention to his own little sad world.”\n“True. Very well, I’ll tell him later then, I probably should get some sleep anyway.”\n\nAs you start to leave, Sebastian suddenly speaks up again.\n\n“Um Catalina…”\n“Yes?” you ask.\n“Uh…”\n\nIs this it? Is he actually going to do it? Today after the night you’ve had? If he is then even as tired as you are, this would be his lucky day because you’d be willing at this point.\n\nHowever, Sebastian still seems to be failing, so you attempt to meet him half way.\n\n“Is there something you would like to tell me Sebastian? Something that’s been on your mind for quite some time? Hmm?” you say even making an uncharacteristic blinking of your eyes. (Though some of that is due to being tired)\n\nUnfortunately this is all too much for poor Sebastian, who just runs away gagging uncontrollably and nearly throwing up in the process.\n\nAnxiety is a bitch and while there’s part of you that feels sorry for him a bit since you have issues of your own, you just don’t really have time for his too. It’s obvious Sebastian is never going to be brave enough even when directly confronted.\n\nAnd as for Mr. Demar, well it’s good thing you never seriously considered going into his office naked.\n\nYou head to your quarters and flop down on the bed. You’re tired, but you still can’t sleep. You’re just so disappointed in yourself for nearly getting killed over something really stupid. Sure it all worked out, but it doesn’t make things any better in your mind.\n\nYou think if you’d at least achieved your goal last night, it would have all been worth it. You don’t think you’ll try this again. You’ll be better off practicing your necromancy on the fresh corpses that just came in.\n\n“Wait a minute. Why the hell didn’t I think about that before?” you say to yourself suddenly being inspired before finally going to sleep.\n\nThe next night…\n\nYou motion your lover to lie down in the coffin, which he does without hesitation. You then remove your own clothing and get in the coffin as well after casting a spell to make him more “functional” for this task.\n\nYou then proceed to have an interesting time until you’ve achieved your goal. At which point you then get out of the coffin and put your clothes back on.\n\nYou realize that it was a hassle getting him here without anyone noticing he was a zombie, so you might as well leave him in the coffin. You release him from his animation and cast preservation spell. You then close up the coffin and figure you can use him again if you ever feel the need. Alec apparently spared no expense on getting a nice coffin; at least it’s not going to waste.\n\n“Wish I’d done that to begin with.” You say and leave the crypt.\n",
  "page 136": "The past memories are starting to become clearer and more vivid. You feel like you’re starting to get closer to goal.\n\nWell you knew it was going to come to this one day, though perhaps there was a part of you that believed it was going to always just stay in the “talk” mode.\n\nStill, somehow you knew when he joined the Dark Order, it was the beginning of the end.\n\nAzrael.\n\nYou aren’t exactly sure what happened, but apparently he and Felsa fucked up Mr. Demar’s talk with a rep from the vampire clans severely to the point where the rep was killed and now the plan to take over Nuro has to be now or never. (You’re just glad it wasn’t you who fucked up that potential alliance and Alec had indeed been telling the truth about being independent)\n\nYou admit you still aren’t sure how you feel about Azrael. First time you actually met him was outside the Dark Order when he miserably failed to impress you. Honestly, you were more than a bit surprised to see him when he joined the Dark Order given how horrible he is of a magic user.\n\nStill, somehow he’s got a real skill for necromancy. Took you a long time to master what you’re able to do with it. Even Trelik struggles with achieving some of the things you’ve seen Azrael do with seeming ease. It’s like it comes natural to him.\n\nMaybe he’s an idiot savant of some sort.\n\nIn any case, Mr. Demar’s called you in for a private discussion. You aren’t exactly sure what about, but you’re sure you’ll find out.\n\nYou enter Mr. Demar’s office who is in the middle of writing something.\n\n“Ah, you’re here. Good. Sit, I’ll be done in a second.”\n\nYou sit down and wait for Mr. Demar to finish what he’s doing which doesn’t take long. He then puts away his quill and parchment and focuses his attention on you.\n\n“Okay, Miss Catalina first I want to say is how impressed I’ve seen you grow in your abilities. I took a risk on you and I’m glad to see it paid off. I know we haven’t spoken much one on one with each other in these last couple years, but that’s partly because you haven’t really needed the supervision or extra guidance. I knew after the first few months of you joining, you were capable of being left to your own devices.”\n“Well I was doing it long before I joined the Order.” You say.\n“Indeed. That’s why you’re going to be playing an important role in the take over of Nuro, which is what I want to go over with you.”\n\nMr. Demar tells you the over all strategy of the plan. Quayle’s job is to slow down time for everyone in the city (except the Dark Order), making them easier to take out. The demonologists will be doing the initial attack by opening portals to the infernal realm to unleash demons on the city. This chaos will put most in a state of panic and allow you and the rest of the necromancers to take advantage of the dead that the demons leave in their path. This momentum should be more than enough to bolster your numbers.\n\n“…And that should be enough to take over Nuro with minimal resistance as well as having enough defense for any immediate counter attack.” Mr. Demar says, but you detect a tone in his voice that makes it seem like he’s not sure of his own plan anymore.\n“We’re going to win.” You say as if to reassure him.\n\nHe looks at you and smiles at what you’re attempting to do.\n\n“Heh, that obvious huh? I suppose I do have my concerns. Not so much about taking Nuro, but more about keeping it. I really do wish we had at least another year to prepare. Hammer out that contract with Velzix and give another thorough read through of it for example. Maybe try to find a few more necromancers.” Mr. Demar says.\n“I’ll admit when I first joined I thought there would be more.” You answer.\n“Well that is one of the reasons I took a chance on you. It’s why you’re going to be in charge of doing crowd control around the city close to the university.”\n“Me?”\n“Yes. Why are you surprised? While I’ve said you’re one of the better necromancers here, I feel you’re probably the most versatile. And I don’t mean just amongst the necromancers, I mean in the entire Order. I want someone who is better able to adapt to a situation as it unfolds. Sebastian isn’t as skilled as you. Irwin…well the boy is pretty, but he’s probably the weakest member among your ranks. Trelik, I’m going to have with me along with Felsa when we face the dean and whatever other faculty that opposes us.”\n“Um, Felsa and Trelik?”\n“Yes, I understand your concerns on that, but Felsa is the best demonologist and I’m going to need her assistance in controlling Velzix for the attack on the dean’s tower. She actually works better under my supervision anyway. As for Trelik, the closer I keep him near me, the less likely he’s going to let his arrogance get the better of him and do something stupidly overconfident.”\n“As you say.”\n“Then there’s Azrael. The newest to the Order and another I took a chance on, though I really don’t know what to make of him still.”\n“Same.”\n“He is a very skilled necromancer, unnaturally so. I’m sure you can sense it. It’s odd since he’s at best a mediocre wizard in any other branch. Downright terrible in some branches. In a perfect world, I would have had a little more time to assess him better. I suppose if this all works out, I’ll be able to.”\n“So is he going to be under my command?”\n“Yes and no. I still consider you to be in charge of the necromancy end of things, but I feel Azrael would be better off working on his own. He’s powerful enough that you won’t need to supervise him directly. I’m going to send him a little closer to downtown area of the city. He can raise the dead from the graveyard along with whomever the demons kill.”\n“Okay then.”\n“Just a few extra things. I want to say. The first is more of a favor if possible.”\n“What is it?”\n“Well I know it’s not much of a secret about Irwin and myself. He’s not the best necromancer, but he’s not without talent. Still I told him I wasn’t going to play favorites, so he has to pull his weight just like everyone else. However, if it is possible, look out for him. I don’t mean at the cost of the overall goal, he knows the risks. But I would appreciate it if he came out of this alive.”\n\nYou’re a little hesitant about being entrusted with someone’s safety.\n\n“You sure it wouldn’t be safer to have him with you then?”\n“Heh, no it would actually be worse since I’m going up against the best wizards in the world and I can’t be distracted with worrying about keeping Irwin alive. I’ll leave that to you.”\n“Gee I’m…honored.”\n“You sound it. But as I said, if things get tricky and it’s a matter of saving Irwin or achieving a win in battle, sacrifice him yourself if necessary.”\n“Got it. Anything else?”\n\nMr. Demar leans forward and actually pats your hand.\n\n“Don’t die. Make the others die and then make them serve you.”\n“I will.”\n\nA week later…\n\n“Sebastian watch the right side, there’s mage guards coming down the street. Irwin raise these bodies, we’re running low and apparently the demon lovers can’t control their fucking summons.” You exclaim.\n\nYou, Sebastian, and Irwin are all in close proximity to each other making sure you keep an eye out on all sides for attacks. So far the battle hasn’t been going as planned.\n\nSeveral things have gone wrong already. Quayle’s time spell is having inconsistent effects for one thing. It hasn’t slowed down your enemies as planned. The more major issue is the demons are not under demonologist control at all. They thankfully haven’t attacked your side, but most of them are just following their own desires rather than any organized attack.\n\nFor your part you’ve been doing your best to take out the Nuro’s mage guards, but it’s not been easy, especially when they’re also backed up by regular rank and file militia.\n\nYou look up at the nearby buildings in front of you and see a sizable amount of archers appear. In fact, here’s more than enough to rain down on you all. You look to your right again and Sebastian is struggling to take out the mage guards.\n\nAnd then the archers unleash their arrows. You don’t have the time to cast a barrier over the three of you, so you do the next best thing and summon a strong plague wind to at least blow the arrows away from your position, along with taking out the archers.\n\nIt works for the most part. Some of the arrows are even blown back at the archers (who are choking to death anyway), one somehow even manages to find its way in the neck of a mage guard, providing some relief for Sebastian.\n\nUnfortunately unlike a magic barrier, it doesn’t cover the entire area you needed. Some of the arrows still found their mark. Specifically Irwin who was still busily attempting to raise the nearby dead strayed away from you a bit and he was hit not once, not twice, but by several of them.\n\nYou look to the left and see Irwin lying on the ground bleeding to death with probably several vital organs punctured. He’s still alive, but he won’t be for long.\n\n“Shit.” You utter.\n\nAs dangerous as it is to try to save Irwin right now, you have to try. You promised Mr. Demar you’d try.\n\nYou run over to Irwin whose eyes are watering up and blood is coming from his mouth. He looks so scared right now. Like he realizes that up until now he’s not just playing with the dead, he’s about to become one with them.\n\n“Oh gods…I’m dying…(gurgle) I don’t…” Irwin sputters.\n“You’re not dying if I can help it. You’ll see Mr. Demar again.” You say and begin casting.\n\nNecromancers aren’t generally known for healing magic, which has always been amusing to you since it’s not that much different than raising the dead. You’re just preventing the body from getting to the state when you have to raise it.\n\nStill Irwin’s wounds are very severe. He’s almost dead, but you begin to focus…\n\nAnd focus…\n\n“Damn it! Come on!” you mutter before.\n\nIt’s no use; you can’t heal him from wounds this bad. Irwin’s eyes roll up into his head and he makes a final gurgling sound before finally dying.\n\n“Fuck!” you exclaim.\n\nYou feel a hand on your shoulder causing you to turn around nearly blasting Sebastian in the face.\n\n“Hey! Hold on! Wait! It’s just me! We’ve put down the resistance in this section for now, but I think we better move to a different location, there are undoubtedly more Nuro guards of the magical and regular kind on their way and I’d hate to get surrounded like we almost did this time.” Sebastian says.\n“Yeah, I guess. Fuck.” You answer, still looking over at Irwin’s body.\n“Hey that’s not your fault.”\n“I know it isn’t, but I’m still going to hate having to tell Mr. Demar…wait is that who I think it is?”\n\n\nYou see Azrael with a large horde of undead. At least someone’s been doing well in this battle. Figures it would be that lucky fool.\n\nHe asks where Irwin is, to which you point at his body. To your minor surprise Azrael raises it from the dead to join his horde. You aren’t sure if Mr. Demar would approve or condemn, but you figure you won’t have to answer for it either way.\n\nAzrael starts giving you and Sebastian orders like he’s suddenly in charge, though his suggestions of him subduing the rest of the fighting force in the city while you both assist at the college isn’t a bad idea given Mr. Demar probably could use assistance and nobody knows what’s going on with Quayle’s time magic.\n\nSince Azrael seems to have confidence in his abilities to take out Nuro’s existing fighting force, you and Sebastian allow him to take control of the remainder of your undead and head towards the college.\n\nThe college is in ruins even more so than other parts of the city. While the carnage and destruction is hardly surprising, what’s more alarming is the fact that you’re seeing buildings phase in and out of existence. You’re also seeing plants grow and wither at accelerated rates. The eastern side of the college is displaying worse signs of the abnormality, and you’re sensing Quayle is over on that side somewhere.\n\n“Shit, this is worse than I thought.” Sebastian says.\n“I don’t even know what to make of this. Obviously something’s gone very wrong with Quayle’s spell.” You say.\n“Mr. Demar is probably over in the dean’s tower if the explosions are any indication, we probably should help him and he can better help with the Quayle situation.” Sebastian says.\n“If we don’t do something about Quayle now though, there might not even BE a city left.”\n\nSebastian looks really reluctant to go anywhere near where Quayle might be, granted you are as well, but someone has to try to do something about this.\n\n“Sebastian you go assist Mr. Demar, I’ll see what’s going on with Quayle.” You say.\n“What? I really don’t think…” Sebastian says before you interrupt him.\n“Just fucking go alright? I’ll be fine.”\n\nSebastian looks very reluctant to leave you and once again he looks like he wants to say more to you. Potentially even do more, but he’s unsure.\n\nYou roll your eyes and grab his hand with your own while patting the top of it with your other hand. He’s a little surprised by your physical reassurance.\n\n“If we both survive this, you REALLY need to work on your self-confidence.” You say and take your leave.\n\nAs you quickly make your way through the eastern side of the college, you realize how damn dangerous this is due to the time holes popping in and out causing severe changes in the landscape. The only good thing about all this is nobody is around to attack you. Everyone is either dead or stayed out of this area.\n\nStill, a little protection might be in order.\n",
  "page 135": "As you continue to swim through your sea of memories, one suddenly calls to you.\n\nAnother dull day in enchantment class…\n\nWhile you’re more than familiar with the enchantment branch of magic and don’t really use it as much as you used to anymore, you figured it wouldn’t hurt to brush up on it again. Plus you still wonder if you can somehow combine elements of it with necromancy like you have with nature magic.\n\nMaybe you can create a stronger control over undead or maybe you could somehow control intelligent undead like vampires. (That sure would have come in handy not long ago)\n\nHowever, this professor teaching has been going about it in the most boring way possible. You seriously considering just not coming in anymore, you could probably learn more on your own. Hell, that’s how you learned the branch in the first place.\n\nStill, you suppose it fills the time and sitting in a classroom reminds you of how much you dislike most of the study body at this place. You admit that you had some reservations about the ideology of the Dark Order at first, but with each passing day you spend here, you’ve been becoming more aligned with their goals.\n\nYou look at most of these people who you already had a low opinion of before and just see them as taking up space. You don’t even hate them so much as you just feel detached from them to a point that they could all disappear and your world wouldn’t be any worse for it. Better in fact.\n\n“Okay that’s all the time for today. Remember to read the chapter on ethical use of enchantment magic. Ethics are VERY important and will definitely be on the next test!” the professor says.\n\nEthical use of enchantment magic. That’s probably the funniest thing he’s said.\n\nAs you get up from your seat, you don’t notice you left your backpack unzipped and everything falls out of it when you pick it up.\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim as you busily attempt to pick everything back up.\n\nAs you’re doing this, you soon see someone standing over you causing you to look up.\n\n“This rolled in front of me, I think it’s yours.” A young man who looks to be in his early twenties says holding out one of your inkbottles.\n\nYou’ve noticed him before. He routinely fails any demonstrations the professor asks for from him. In fact, you’ve heard few comments made by other students in the class of how he’s generally terrible in most classes. One wonders how he hasn’t flunked out completely.\n\nYou take the ink and shove it into your backpack without even saying thanks. He doesn’t seem offended though.\n\n“Here let me help you get some of this.” He says.\n“It’s fine I got it.” You reply.\n“Okay. So you’re Catalina right? My name’s Azrael. The professor mentioned you had a perfect score on the last test when I had to talk to him about my grades.”\n\nAzrael crouches down to your level. Now you’re getting annoyed.\n\n“And?” you say.\n“Oh nothing, it’s just really impressive. I’ve been having difficulty with some of the simplest spells in this class.”\n“Well I’m not tutoring.”\n\nYou finish shoving the rest of your stuff in your backpack and walk away. However, Azrael is walking the same direction as you and still talking.\n\n“Heh, I don’t think even if you did tutor me, it would do any good. Enchantment magic is just really confusing and I thought illusions were difficult!”\n“Maybe magic isn’t your thing.”\n“You might be right, since I’ve been trying every branch and none of it is really calling to me. You ever feel that way?”\n“Can’t say I have.”\n“Wow, you’re really lucky then for it to just come so natural.”\n\nWhy he still talking to you? You can only imagine there’s one reason and since you don’t feel like being harassed you’ll just call him out right now.\n\nYou stop walking and look him in the eye.\n\n“You want me to suck your dick is that it?” you say catching Azrael by surprise.\n“Um…uh…well…are you offering?” Azrael sputters.\n“That’s what I thought.” You say and shake your head not having time for this nonsense.\n\nYou don’t get far when Azrael is attempting to catch up to you again.\n\n“Hey wait, hold on.” Azrael says.\n“I’m about to throw a fireball in your face.” You say, stopping again.\n“Well just hold on before you do that. I’ll admit that I was clumsily building up to trying to ask you out. It’s another thing I’m not great at, but I wasn’t looking for quick sex or anything like that. I’m not opposed to a long-term relationship if that’s what you’re concerned about.”\n“Yeah well I don’t care WHAT you were looking for. I’m not fucking interested.”\n“Okay. I’ll leave you be. My apologies. You have a nice day.”\n\nAzrael leaves walking backwards with his hands held up like you’re going to attack him. He then eventually turns around and walks away.\n\nYou turn around and head to your own destination. You’re just glad he gave up a lot quicker than most. You were in no mood today.\n\nStill, you almost felt like in your brief interaction with Azrael there was something familiar. Not him specifically since you’ve never interacted with him before. His aura?\n\nNah, he was no necromancer. Not with his poor magical ability you’ve seen in class, not even a budding one would be so bad at magic at this stage of life. And he certainly wasn’t a vampire given his poor attempts at trying to pick you up.\n\nYou shrug and chalk it up to being tired of hanging around the living.\n\nThis memory causes you to laugh now.\n",
  "page 138": "You cast a strong magic shield around you and hope it gets you through this.\n\nYou proceed to head east watching the very landscape change around you. It’s actually making you feel slightly dizzy. There is one building that isn’t changing though. It’s a small gray building sitting apart from the others. You don’t even remember seeing it before during your time here, but that hardly matters since you’re getting a very strong feeling that’s where you’re going to find Quayle.\n\nYou get closer though there is some disturbance going on with your shield. You maintain it, but it’s getting harder to do so as you go along.\n\nEventually you’re within a short walk of entering the gray building, but the disturbances are popping in and out even quicker. You can’t readily keep track of where they’re located.\n\nHoping your shield holds, you take a deep breath and run to the entrance. Unfortunately you get caught up in not one, but several of the time disturbances before you even reach the entrance.\n\nYour shield provides little to no protection against such strong chronomagic. You feel your body change and one look at your right hand and you’ve aged considerably. Or at least part of you has.\n\nYou nearly collapse from the weakness and drop your shield as you can’t keep it up and it isn’t protecting you anyway. You feel another change in your body except this feels like…shrinking?\n\nYour left leg has reverted to the size of a child’s, You can’t survive this much longer, your only hope is somehow Quayle can help you. Determined to survive, you manage to drag and crawl your way into the building.\n\nAnd there you see him sitting in one of the auditorium classrooms in a lotus like position on the floor in a trance. A strange white field of energy surrounds him.\n\nBarely managing to prop yourself up against a wall, you hop towards his position and then he speaks.\n\n“You…are not supposed to be here…this is not the time…” Quayle says in an echoed voice.\n“Quayle! You need to fix whatever it is you fucked up and more importantly fix me!” you shout.\n“Can’t fix you…you’re dead…”\n“What? I’m not dead, but I soon will be if you don’t stop this!”\n“No…all was going as planned…miscalculation…wait…ah…there we go…”\n“Wha…”\n“Another way Catalina…you will be reunited…not this way…”\n\nYou hear these cryptic words from Quayle and then suddenly everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell that was strange. You aren’t quite sure what to make of all that, but Quayle seemed very sure you didn’t belong there. And how did he know that? And he said you were dead. How did he know that too?\n\nYou can only chalk this one up to Quayle somehow having insight into not just time, but multiple dimensions or something. You don’t know, even in your spiritual state, the complex theories of chrono magic field is making your head hurt.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 137": "Fuck it. You’re just going to do it. There’s no safe way to fuck a vampire and tonight that’s exactly what you’ve decided to do.\n\n“Look Alec, you said you’re just passing through and you’re not looking for dinner, you’re looking to get laid right?” you ask.\n“Well…yes, but…” Alec says before you interrupt.\n“Good, so am I. So let’s drop all the getting to know you stuff and just get to it. You got a place we can go to? Can’t really go back to mine, I live with a bunch of other people and you showing up might cause issues.”\n“Yes, I have place.”\n“Good, let’s get out of here then.”\n\nYou stand up first and start walking out the door; Alec soon catches up saying to wait up.\n\nAlec soon takes the lead and it doesn’t take long before the pair of you are heading to the city graveyard. You can’t say you’re too surprised.\n\n“Graveyard? Seems a bit on the nose doesn’t it?” you say.\n“Heh, don’t worry, we won’t be out in the open. There’s a crypt this way I use when I’m in town, this way.”\n\nYou follow Alec to the crypt and after a walk down some stairs and through a few catacombs; you eventually reach a well “kept” area with a fancy coffin. You look around and see despite the bricked interior of the room; nature is still finding a way inside as several large tree roots are breaking through the old weakened brick.\n\n“You might want to be careful with where your coffin’s location is Alec, a tree could come crashing down on it.” You say.\n“Yeah, this place has seen better days, but I certainly call it home when I’m here. Really need to do something about the grave wings flying about the catacombs though. I don’t remember there being so many before. Ugh, there’s even a few in here.”\n“You don’t like them? I’ve always thought they were pretty.”\n“Hm, maybe that’s because they don’t bite you.”\n“I didn’t see them bite you when we were walking down here.”\n“They usually don’t, but…well given a vampire’s state of existence and what grave wings typically feast on and let’s just say the occasional curious or hungry one isn’t adverse to nipping one of my kind occasionally.”\n“Heh, I guess I can see why that would make you a little apprehensive with a large number of them around. So…should I just take my clothes off and get in the coffin then?”\n“Sheesh, you work fast for someone who’s never done this before.”\n\nYou stay silent in your response, but Alec answers for you.\n\n“I know you’re a virgin Catalina. I can smell your purity.”\n“Excuse me? Just because I’m a necromancer doesn’t mean I’m forego bath…”\n“No, no, no, it’s your blood. The blood never lies.” Alec interrupts.\n“How would those two things even…nevermind, guessing it’s one of your vamp powers. So that another reason you were drawn to me? Like ‘em fresh huh?”\n“And you like the dead.”\n\nYou notice Alec’s staring at you intently during your conversation and you catch yourself looking directly at him and look away.\n\n“Y’know intimacy is going to be very difficult if you’re going to insist on not looking at me. You going to keep your eyes closed the entire time? That’s no way to experience your first time.” Alec remarks.\n“Well how about you just lift up my dress and bend me over your coffin then? That way I’ll be able to keep my eyes open the entire time. I would have thought someone of your years would be a little more imaginative in various sexual positions.” you answer.\n“Oh trust me, I could get very imaginative with such things…but since you’re insistent on being so blunt, I suppose I might as well do the same.”\n\nAlec stands up a bit straighter and you feel a decidedly different demeanor. A more predatory one.\n\n“So. You were looking for prey after all.” You say backing away.\n“No, actually I wasn’t. As I said, I already ate before I entered the Alkymist. However, I am in need of companionship.” Alec says.\n“I thought that’s what we were going to do.”\n“Mm, yes but I would like a more permanent arrangement. You see, I’m starting to get to a point in my existence where I would like to share it with someone. Who better than a necromancer?”\n“I’m flattered, but I just don’t feel I’m ready to make such a commitment. I can see this was a bad idea. I’ll just be going…” you say, but before you can step past him, he moves to block the doorway.\n\nThe true colors are showing.\n\n“Come now. While I know you avoided giving too much away about yourself. Even I can tell how drawn you are to death. Why be a necromancer dabbling with death when you could literally be the embodiment of it? Just think of the new places you could go and things you could do. That WE could do. You’d achieve what necromancers often only dream of. Immortality. And you’d remain as beautiful as you are now.”\n\nWhile you’re realizing what a terrible idea this was, you’re also just mentally shaking your head at the fact that you not only pick a vampire, but you pick one that wants you to spend the rest of eternity with him.\n\nThis might even be romantic if it was under different circumstances.\n\n“Honeyed words, and let’s say you’re telling the truth. Wouldn’t you have power over me as my creator?”\n“I would never abuse such power.”\n“You’re abusing it right now.”\n“How?”\n“By not letting me leave! You’re attempting to intimidate me into going along with your plan without a fuss. Look, if you really do desire me the way you say you do, then let me leave and at least let me think about your proposal.”\n\nAlec’s eyes begin to turn a darker red and while he still keeps his distance, he’s obviously attempting to hold back his anger.\n\n“And have you disappear completely because you let fear limit you? You’re telling me you didn’t come here expecting something like this to happen? Did you really believe we were going to just have sex and part ways? You’re either very stupid…which I don’t believe, OR more likely THIS is something you really want but are too scared to make that final step. Trust me Catalina, there is nothing to fear.”\n“Alright Alec, just stay back.” You say noticing he’s starting to walk towards you.\n“Catalina, I’m faster than you are. I could easily reach you before you could even get off a spell. You know this. It won’t hurt I’ll be gentle as possible I promise.”\n“Alec, last chance to back off…”\n“I don’t want to hurt you, but you’re making me do this.”\n“Same.”\n\nAnd just as Alec locks his gaze on you and is about to lunge for your throat, he stops when he sees a thick piece of dead wood coming through his chest. You’d been manipulating the roots coming through the crypt’s bricks as soon as he started blocking the doorway. He makes a few hissing sounds then his whole body goes limp causing the weight of it to break the rest of the root as he falls to the stone floor.\n\nYou step aside and take a look at Alec as he remains impaled through the back and unmoving. You’re curious to as why he’s paralyzed and not outright dead though since you see his eyes still moving.\n\n“Hm, I guess I only nicked your heart huh? Damn, I meant to kill you instantly. Ah well.”\n\nYou step away looking at his body.\n\n“Well I can’t leave you like this. I already did one stupid thing tonight and I’m not about to do a second one leaving a pissed off vampire alive. Especially one a bit obsessed with me.”\n\nYou figure the quick way would be to just manipulate the piece of wood already in his chest though that seems a bit too quick now. Dragging him to the surface so he can explode in the sun might be fitting, but it also could cause attention.\n\nYou briefly look around room for a moment and then smile when you realize Alec and yourself aren’t the only ones in here.\n\nNormally you don’t attempt to control living animals with your nature magic skills, but you don’t think the gravewings will mind.\n\nYou first call the ones in the room to land on Alec. They immediately start biting his ear. Soon your chant calls forth many more of them from the catacombs. In fact there’s enough of them that they resemble a glowing green ball of light. The swarm descends on Alec’s body for a big feast.\n\n“Y’know Alec, it really didn’t have to end this way. I wouldn’t have disappeared on you, I really would have thought about your proposal because I can even admit; there was a large appeal to it. I can’t say for certain if I would have said yes, but because you couldn’t have just been a little more patient, neither of us will ever know. What I do know though, is I won’t be trusting your kind in the future and you won’t be having a future.”\n\nWhat follows next is you watching Alec slowly being eaten alive as he remains in his fixed prone position. He can’t scream, but his eyes are darting back and forth the entire time he watches the hungry insects eat his flesh. Well at least until they start eating his eyes.\n\nOf course it would take a few days for the gravewings to eat a body as big as Alec’s (the poor things can’t possibly eat it all in one sitting) so eventually you do end Alec’s torment and manipulate another root to go through his chest, this one going directly through his heart, at which point he exploded into a heap of gore, though given that part of him was eaten anyway there’s not as much as there would have been.\n\nWith little else here for you, you leave the crypt only to find that dawn is breaking.\n\n“Another day, and still as chaste as the day I was born. Which ever that one was.” You say to yourself and head back to the college.\n\nWhen you get back you bump into Sebastian in the hallway.\n\n“You’re up early.” Sebastian says.\n“Eh, didn’t really sleep. I was busy with…a new spell.” You answer.\n“Oh really? What is it?”\n“Nothing important really. Just a little experiment with nature magic and necromancy.”\n“I think you really are the first one to mix such divergent branches of magic.”\n“And I still don’t think they’re that opposite from each other. Everything living eventually dies, that’s certainly part of nature. It’s all part of the cycle. It’s just nobody sees the beauty in death like they do in nature.”\n“I suppose not, but beauty is everywhere. Well in any case some new corpses came in. Some idiots apparently died playing the mystery potion game at last night’s Manticore House party. A rarity we get bodies so fresh to practice necromancy on.”\n“Indeed. Oh, are you familiar with a vampire by the name of Alec? Looks about late twenties to early thirties, black hair, pale, on the handsome side of looks.”\n“That could describe most vampires from what I’ve seen of some of the reps from the vampire clans. Can’t remember one called Alec though. You meet one or something?”\n“You could say that, though he claimed he was independent of the clans.”\n“Also possible. Well in any case you better tell Mr. Demar as soon as possible just in case.”\n“Okay.”\n“Oh, probably not now though, I think he’s still sleeping in with Irwin.”\n“Wait…Irwin? You mean Mr. Demar is…”\n“Yeah. You really didn’t know?”\n“No, why would I? I barely remember Irwin is even here most of the time. And Trelik implied Felsa routinely slept with Mr. Demar.”\n“And he also implied the same nasty rumor about you and that wasn’t true either right? Trelik’s an idiot who only pays attention to his own little sad world.”\n“True. Very well, I’ll tell him later then, I probably should get some sleep anyway.”\n\nAs you start to leave, Sebastian suddenly speaks up again.\n\n“Um Catalina…”\n“Yes?” you ask.\n“Uh…”\n\nIs this it? Is he actually going to do it? Today after the night you’ve had? If he is then even as tired as you are, this would be his lucky day because you’d be willing at this point.\n\nHowever, Sebastian still seems to be failing, so you attempt to meet him half way.\n\n“Is there something you would like to tell me Sebastian? Something that’s been on your mind for quite some time? Hmm?” you say even making an uncharacteristic blinking of your eyes. (Though some of that is due to being tired)\n\nUnfortunately this is all too much for poor Sebastian, who just runs away gagging uncontrollably and nearly throwing up in the process.\n\nAnxiety is a bitch and while there’s part of you that feels sorry for him a bit since you have issues of your own, you just don’t really have time for his too. It’s obvious Sebastian is never going to be brave enough even when directly confronted.\n\nAnd as for Mr. Demar, well it’s good thing you never seriously considered going into his office naked.\n\nYou head to your quarters and flop down on the bed. You’re tired, but you still can’t sleep. You’re just so disappointed in yourself for nearly getting killed over something really stupid. Sure it all worked out, but it doesn’t make things any better in your mind.\n\nYou think if you’d at least achieved your goal last night, it would have all been worth it. You don’t think you’ll try this again. You’ll be better off practicing your necromancy on the fresh corpses that just came in.\n\n“Wait a minute. Why the hell didn’t I think about that before?” you say to yourself suddenly being inspired before finally going to sleep.\n\nThe next night…\n\nYou motion your lover to lie down in the coffin, which he does without hesitation. You then remove your own clothing and get in the coffin as well after casting a spell to make him more “functional” for this task.\n\nYou then proceed to have an interesting time until you’ve achieved your goal. At which point you then get out of the coffin and put your clothes back on.\n\nYou realize that it was a hassle getting him here without anyone noticing he was a zombie, so you might as well leave him in the coffin. You release him from his animation and cast preservation spell. You then close up the coffin and figure you can use him again if you ever feel the need. Alec apparently spared no expense on getting a nice coffin; at least it’s not going to waste.\n\n“Wish I’d done that to begin with.” You say and leave the crypt.\n",
  "page 139": "No reason to let these bodies go to waste. They’ll act as your shields. Besides, who knows if this area is entirely deserted, you might need active defenders.\n\nYou raise up as many dead bodies as you see in the area and more as you see them heading further east.\n\nYou proceed to head east watching the very landscape change around you. It’s actually making you feel slightly dizzy. There is one building that isn’t changing though. It’s a small gray building sitting apart from the others. You don’t even remember seeing it before during your time here, but that hardly matters since you’re getting a very strong feeling that’s where you’re going to find Quayle.\n\nYou get closer though a few of your zombies undergo drastic changes. The less alarming are the times when they walk into a time hole that accelerates their age turning them into dust.\n\nMore interesting are where time reverses and they’re living again. Not for long though since they eventually revert even further into embryos then nothing.\n\nEventually you’re within a short walk of entering the gray building, but the disturbances are popping in and out even quicker. You can’t readily keep track of where they’re located.\n\nSince you’re certainly not going to risk walking through an area with a bunch of time holes, you start sending your remaining zombies to try to mark a safe way through. Unfortunately you don’t have many left, and you soon run out before you can determine a secure path.\n\nWhile you’re pondering your next move to proceed, you’re mildly surprised to see Azrael approaching you again with several more corpses. You’re guessing he must have succeeded in quelling the remainder of Nuro resistance. Impressive.\n\n“I see you chose to check on Quayle.” Azrael says.\n“Yeah, I think he’s in that small gray building over there, the only one that seems to be stable. I can’t get to him though, well at least I’m not risking it, I sent some of my troops in there and I watched them either accelerate in rot and disintegrate, or even stranger actually turn back into their living selves until they eventually became babies and then nothing. In fact I’m getting out of here as it only seems to be getting worse. This plan sucks.” You reply.\n“Well someone’s gotta go in, so I guess I’ll do it. I’ve risked too much already to fail. I suggest you go help Mr. Demar.”\n\nOnce again Azrael’s giving orders like he’s in charge. Not that his demanding suggestions aren’t unreasonable, especially since you’d rather check Mr. Demar than deal with this time madness anyway. Still, it’s a little presumptuous.\n\n“Wow, this whole thing has really made you really authoritative. You’ve come a long way since Enchantment class.” You say.\n“Yeah well I’ve had a revelation that I’m really good at this necromancy stuff and I won’t be denied my career in it before it’s truly begun.”\n\nBefore you can reply, Azrael suddenly grabs you and kisses you on the lips.\n\nYou always wondered what your first kiss might be like. Not bad, but he’s still crossed a line.\n\nYou push Azrael away and slap him in the face. Another time, you might’ve been more inclined to do more damage, but he’s sort of necessary right now.\n\n“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?! Just because you’re not incompetent at one thing, doesn’t automatically mean I’m wet for you!” you exclaim.\n“Well let me show you I’m not incompetent in two things then!” he replies.\n\nThere’s something inherently so silly about his advances that it’s almost amusing. Or it would be any other time, not right now though.\n\n“Ha ha. Maybe later, like next century. Nice try though. But I will go help Mr. Demar seeing as that would be the best course of action for me. Good luck with the time storm there.” You respond.\n\nYou turn around and leave Azrael to deal with the Quayle situation. Hopefully he has as much focus on dealing with Quayle as he has on watching your ass as you leave.\n\nYou head towards campus where various explosions are taking place, there’s plenty of dead, though the corpses aren’t in the best condition since most are in several pieces. However, you do find one intact corpse.\n\nYou see Sebastian lying on the ground not far from administration building. He’s got several severe burns and his innards are leaking out of him. He’s beyond healing at this point.\n\n“Damn, Sebastian. You probably deserved better.” You say and briefly ponder raising him, but decide not to.\n\nYou enter the administration building. Smoke, fire and body parts look all around. In the distance you hear shouting followed by magic blasts.\n\n“TRELIK YOU TREACHEROUS BASTARD!” you hear Mr. Demar shout.\n“Ha ha! You’re weak old man and I’m taking over this shit!” you hear Trelik shout back.\n\nYou can’t say you’re too surprised that Trelik has betrayed Mr. Demar, though you thought Trelik might at least be smart enough to wait until AFTER securing the city. His arrogance will be his undoing.\n\nYou go down a corridor where you think the voices are coming from, turn a corner and nearly run right into Trelik, who is somewhat surprised by your arrival.\n\n“YOU! Good, I could use a recharge!” Trelik says grabbing your wrist and attempts to drain your life force; you feel an immediate effect and drop to your knees.\n\n“See, had you gotten in that position sooner, you might have saved your miserable life!” Trelik laughs.\n\nAnd there it is, Trelik’s arrogance being his undoing. You might be weakened, but you’re certainly not defenseless. You mumble a few words turning your hand and part of your arm to bark, this is followed by razor sharp thorns coming out, slicing Trelik’s hand enough that he has no choice but to let go.\n\n“BITCH!” he exclaims backing off and clutching his shredded hand. You think you might have even cut off a few bits of his fingers.\n\nMr. Demar arrives just as you’re getting up off the floor. Trelik looks around and sees he’s trapped between the pair of you. With only one good hand, he realizes he’s not going to win this fight.\n\n“This isn’t over!” he shouts and pulls out a small vial in his belt, uncorking it with his teeth downing the contents making him intangible. Trelik then runs through the nearby wall.\n\nMr. Demar rushes over to you to see if you’re okay.\n\n“Catalina, you alright?” Mr. Demar asks.\n“Yeah, just woozy. Fuck, Trelik got away.” you respond.\n“We’ll have to get him later, my guess though is he’s a non-factor for the rest of this battle. Underestimated his arrogance and stupidity though, I guess you were right about that. In any event, what are you doing here? I hope things aren’t going badly outside the college too. Where’s everyone else?”\n“Sebastian’s dead and so is Irwin… my apologies Mr. Demar, I really tried to keep him alive.”\n\nMr. Demar looks down briefly in disappointment, but isn’t overly concerned.\n\n“Hm, well the boy surviving this wasn’t a certainty. I’m sure you did your best. Is there ANY good news?”\n“Azrael managed to put down the rest of the city’s resistance and is currently attempting to handle the time anomalies due to Quayle. I don’t know how he’s doing on that front though since I came over to help you.”\n“Knowing Azrael he’ll probably come out of all this unscathed. Hope so because at this point it sounds like most of the Dark Order is dead. In any case, since you’re here we need to finish off the remainder of the faculty.”\n“Wait, you had Felsa with you, she’s dead too?”\n“I’d be surprised if she isn’t. When we first engaged the dean, I told her to stay close by even after he retreated. That idiot went chasing after him by herself, I would have followed if only to make sure she didn’t get herself killed, but that’s when the treacherous bastard Trelik attempted to kill me.”\n“Okay, so where’s the dean so we can take him out?”\n“He’s probably cowering in his office, but I’ll be taking care of him, I need you to hunt down a couple of other faculty members that split off from the dean during the initial battle. I don’t think they got far since they both were wounded. Still, I don’t want any of the senior staff getting away. The more skilled wizards we take out now, the less we have to deal with later.”\n“You know where they went?”\n“Pretty sure they’ll be trying to make it to conveyance building, it’s the closest means of escape without leaving through the city gates. Before that double crossing demon left, I’m fairly certain Velzix destroyed the transport portals there, but it’s possible he didn’t get all of them or the escapees might even try to salvage together something there to get them out of the city quickly. I’d advise you head there first and show that there is no escape from the Dark Order.”\n\nYou nod and set out to conveyance building, which isn’t that far from the administration building.\n\nYou’ve never really been into conveyance magic. It’s actually one of the harder forms to master and if you mess up, you could suddenly find yourself in a brickwall. You practiced it a couple times and it always made you nauseous. Not like you really want to travel long distances anyway.\n\nAs you remember, the portal area of the building should be on the ground floor, so they shouldn’t be far, though you’re hoping they haven’t already escaped.\n\nYou get closer to your destination and that’s when you hear some voices. You cautiously peak around the corner and see two humans, one heavily wounded male on the floor and a less wounded female fumbling around with one of the broken portals. The female looks pregnant.\n\n“I think I can get this working. I just need charge it up and we can probably at least\nteleport to the Brot Kingdom. David! You still with me?” the female says.\n“Huh…yeah yeah, I’m here Maggie. I…just…I dunno…” David responds.\n“Hey! We’re gonna get out of this okay? All three of us! We’ll get…”\n\nMaggie’s attention shifts and sees you enter the room. You can sense fear in her, but she’s definitely ready for a fight if she has to.\n\n“You…you’re one of Demar’s students aren’t you? You’re a bit younger than the rest I’ve seen.” Maggie says.\n“Still old enough to end the pair of you.” You reply.\n“Wait! Look, just let us leave. We’re no threat to you. My husband and I aren’t even important. Just let us go and we will not cause you any trouble.”\n“Perhaps, but I can’t take that chance. The best I can offer is to make it quick. Your husband isn’t going to make it anyway. I can already sense that’s he’s near death.”\n\nYou fully expect her to try to attack next, but she doesn’t. Instead she falls to her knees, crawling over to David and holding one hand over her stomach.\n\n“Please! I beg mercy! If not for either of us, then for my child! I swear to all the gods that we will never seek revenge or join any force against you in the future!”\n\nMaggie looks at you with tears in her eyes as she partially holds on to her husband, who looks like he’s going to die soon. He’s struggling to keep his eyes open, but manages to turn his head towards you and has a slackjaw expression.\n\nIt’s a rather pitiful sight and then comes the crying.\n\nWhich then starts to get very loud very quickly.\n\n“Shit.” You say and start to hold your ears. The bitch has cast some sort of sonic scream spell and it’s enough to break any sort of concentration you have.\n\nYou barely avoid a lightning blast and scramble to duck back behind the entryway for cover.\n\n“Dark art using cunt! Come out coward!” you hear Maggie shout followed by feeling the force of the wall you’re hiding behind being hit.\n\nYou aren’t sure what she’s casting, but it’s obvious she’s not going to let the walls stop her. She’s unlikely to come out after you, but at this point she doesn’t really need to. You’ll have to move soon.\n\nYou just aren’t sure if you should just attack right now, or wait for an opening.\n",
  "page 22": "You’re here now and you’re not coming back without at least confirmation that Sinthinia is paying for her defiance against your regime.\n\nWhile you suppose you could just continue looking for her by yourself, you feel like this mortal is the best chance you have for a lead. He’s more tolerable than the angels though the downside is he’s not even willing to help you, but maybe that can be changed.\n\n“Human, if you just tell me where these cells are located, you don’t even need to go there, just give me directions. In return I’ll get you out of here.” You offer.\n“Get me out of here eh? And I suppose much like Big Red’s offer, that will involve a one way trip to the infernal realm where I can suffer for all eternity. Yeah, no thanks. This place might not be the most pleasant, but at least I’m not going to spend the rest of my afterlife existence with a pitchfork up my ass.” Arash replies.\n“First of all, we’d use a variety of objects to shove up your ass. Second, I can promise you that wouldn’t be your fate.”\n“No, just some other equally horrible fate no doubt. Big Red attempted this too, and I wasn’t buying it then. I know you infernals and you’re twisty word tricks.”\n“Well what would convince you? All I can offer is my word and granted that’s a dubious offer from anyone, let alone from an infernal. I can only assure you that IF you tell me what I want to know and we all get out of this alive, I WILL honor a promise right here and now that your body and soul will NOT suffer a horrible agonizing fate by me directly or indirectly and you will be taken home to the place of your choosing.”\n\nThe human looks at your eyes with a mixture of suspicion and vague hopefulness. You know he really wants to leave this place despite his mistrustful nature.\n\n“You must REALLY want this bitch huh? Guessing she must have done something really bad to you, what was it exactly?” the human asks.\n“She defied the new order that I am bringing to the infernal realm. She must pay for her impudence and ideally I will decide her punishment directly.”\n“Hm. Glad I’m not on your bad side, if you’re willing to go to all this trouble…okay fuck it. Since you seem to be so driven on your task rather than concerning yourself with gaining my soul along with making a promise like you just did. I’ll point you in the right direction, but since you are potentially my way out of this place, I feel like I should tell you a little more about this place in general just so you know what you’re up against.”\n“What’s to know? This place is a prison for celestials, though it sounds like Engan has been turning it into his own personal playground.”\n“Eh, that’s only partially correct. During my time here, I’ve managed to hear things, find things and obviously see things that aren’t what the mayor claims to be. This place wasn’t created as a prison for celestials. From what I’ve gathered it was here long before that. Something much older created this little place or lived here or something. And I don’t even think the original inhabitants are completely gone.”\n“So?”\n“My point is, things are more fucked up here than they appear. While I’m sure you already got that impression, I’m stressing that these celestials aren’t just here for minor offenses. I don’t even think they were sent here as punishment. I think this was some sort of hiding place for them from whatever higher powers they offended, but it became a prison for them in the long run. They’ve been here so long now that this place has twisted their very essence so much that most of them are probably wishing they were dead. The others, well they’ve embraced it so much that they no longer could be considered celestials except in the superficial sense I suppose. Don’t trust anything.”\n“I’m an infernal. I never do. Duly noted though.”\n\nArash nods and then begins to tell you how to find the Cells. He explains to you that they are located in one of the houses in town close to the tavern, but you won’t find it walking forward, you’ll have to walk backwards.\n\n“Are you fucking serious?” you say.\n“This is how I found it by accident. I ended up taking a few steps backwards once and looked to my left and suddenly I saw a door that wasn’t there before on one of the houses.” Arash replies.\n“You sure it was always there and you just didn’t notice it when passing before?”\n“The door was in the corner of the house AND it was upside down. I think I would have seen it before. I went in because it isn’t like I had much else to do in this place. As I said, I wish I hadn’t though, but in the off chance that you’re successful in whatever it is you’re attempting to do, I guess it will have been worth it.”\n“Oh I’ll be successful, and when I drag that bitch out of there, you better make sure you’re near that dead tree outside town because it’ll be your only chance to get out of here.”\n“I guess I’ll see. Oh one more thing infernal. When you find the door, chances are very likely that you’ll start experiencing alterations of reality. I can’t quite explain it entirely, but rest to say, it’s unpleasant and not good. Be prepared.”\n\nWith those words, you take your leave of Arash and head back towards where the tavern was located. As you’re passing the tavern you see Posil and his group hanging around outside this time.\n\n“Well if it isn’t the infernal beauty back again. Change your mind about that game?” Posil asks.\n\nYou ignore him and turn around and begin to walk backwards looking at the houses as you pass them by.\n\n“What the fuck is she doing?” one of the angels says.\n“Is she…?” another starts to ask.\n“I think so, you better go find Engan’s ass.” Posil remarks and all of them immediately fly off, though you’re not really worried about it.\n\nYou continue your search and finally you pass the house you seek. You see the upside door in the corner of it that Arash was talking about. You also feel a little odd. It’s like when you were around Engan.\n\nAnd no sooner that you’ve had that thought Posil lands right in front of the door. He doesn’t look quite as sparkly though. In fact his skin is grayer. It’s matching the rest of this place in fact.\n\n“Sorry my infernal beauty, but I believe you’ve uncovered a part of this place that you probably shouldn’t enter.” Posil remarks.\n“Oh? And why is that?” you ask.\n“Well it’s dangerous. There are some really evil types in there.”\n\nYou laugh at this remark.\n\n“You do realize you’re speaking to an infernal right? Besides, isn’t this whole place filled with evil types? I mean this whole place IS a prison correct?” you say.\n“No, we’re not evil. We just merely just saw another way; in fact in some cases you could say some of us saw a BETTER way. And yes, this place is a prison, but even in a prison there are precautions to separate the deadlier prisoners from the rest of the population.”\n“Hm from what I’ve heard this place isn’t even a prison. It was here before you lot showed up to hide from the higher powers you offended.”\n\nNow Posil no longer maintains his false smile at all, and you begin to see anger.\n\n“And I see you’ve been speaking to Arash. The filthy human that does nothing but spread lies and stink up the town. I’m surprised you would even be listening to such a lowly creature, but then you infernals have never been known for your intelligence.”\n“Well then I guess it’s time to stop thinking altogether and start doing something really stupid like entering your cells.” You say and begin to move towards the door, Posil doesn’t move though.\n\n“Stop! You don’t have permission to enter!” Posil shouts.\n“Don’t see why I wouldn’t I’m an infernal. Pretty sure I qualify as what you would consider an evil type. Move aside Posil,”\n“I’m not moving and you can’t make me infernal. Now if you REALLY want to go inside, I suppose I can allow it, if you ask for permission and let me accompany you.”\n“Last chance to get out of my way Posil.”\n“Or you’ll what? What can you do to me? No violence allowed infernal remember?”\n“Maybe I’m just not trying hard enough then…” you say drawing your sword.\n“Infernal, I’m warning you. Strike me with that sword and you’ll regret it.”\n\nYou look around and see you’ve drawn a crowd of other celestials looking on. They all have different expressions on their faces. Some are obviously showing displeasure, though others are showing concern. Still others don’t seem to show any sign that they care one way or another except this is something that is breaking up the monotony.\n\nNone of them are trying to stop you however. Granted they can’t touch you anymore than you can touch them, but they aren’t protesting verbally either. They’re all just watching and waiting to see what you might do next.\n\nWhile you’re scanning the crowd one thing catches your eye for a second. You think you see one of the angels silently mouth the words “Free us.”\n\nYou look back at Posil and notice he’s making odd twitching movements. You blink and for the briefest moment his face isn’t the same, it’s covered in multiple mouths and eyes. The mouths aren’t all horizontal either, some are vertical and most of them are filled with disjointed teeth or drooling some sort of black liquid. The eyes are of all different colors and sizes.\n\nThen it’s back to normal.\n\nSomething definitely isn’t right here and you’re actually feeling… well the word isn’t quite fear, but you’re definitely feeling very uneasy. You haven’t felt this way in a very long time.\n\n“Well? You going to swing that sword infernal? Or you just going to admire my superior celestial physique?” Posil asks with a grin that is entirely too wide.\n",
  "page 21": "As much as you’re loathed to admit, something about this place IS unsettling. There is a sense of wrongness that even without the human’s warnings that has you slightly more uneasy about all this than you’ve ever felt in the infernal realm.\n\nIf you had at least some sort of back up or even more knowledge of this place, you might be inclined to take more risk, but ultimately you decide that you gave it a shot and it might be better to err on the side of caution.\n\nStill, you hate just leaving Sinthinia unpunished, but hopefully the human is right and she’s already suffering a fate worse than death (and then death too).\n\nYou take your leave of the human without saying another word and start to make your way out of the town. A few groups of celestials watch you, but nobody else approaches to talk.\n\nEventually you reach the tree and as you’re about to open the portal with your beacon stone, you hear a voice, several of them in fact.\n\n“Leaving so soon? You should stay here with us. You think you have a destiny there? Stay and discover what true destiny is.”\n\nOther voices say something similar, all with the urging of wanting you to stay. Part of this is odd since you’ve felt mildly unwanted since you came here, but then again nothing about this place has felt very natural. You shake off the minor pull to stick around and open the portal to enter it.\n\nAs soon as you arrive, you immediately feel a difference in your comfort level. This might be hell, but there really is no place like home.\n\nYou also notice that Zeljenir isn’t at her post like she should be, in fact nobody is in the room at all. Good thing you didn’t need any help immediately.\n\nYou soon bump into some underlings that were unaware that you were back and mention they think they saw Zeljenir with Captain Spolnapad earlier.\n\nYou shake your head and demand to know where they were seen heading. You’re already in a bad mood from your recent trip. You haven’t been gone long and subordinates are losing their damn minds disobeying direct commands.\n\nDoesn’t take long to find Spol and Zel going at it in some room…with a crowd watching. When the crowd sees you, most of them quickly scatter or at least get out of your way.\n\nSpol turns his head just in time to see your blade coming down on it, causing blood to splatter on your armor, on the floor and on Zel’s back.\n\n“How the fuck did you do that, you’re still inside…oh shit!” Zel says turning her head and realizing the wetness on her back was a release precious fluids of a whole different kind.\n\nZel immediately rolls and scoots away before Spol’s body slumps lifelessly to the floor. She says nothing and just looks up at you with wide-eyed fear. At this point everyone else has run out the room.\n\n“You both had ONE job…”\n“I…”\n“SILENCE! I don’t want to hear excuses! I can see a more direct method of getting you to obey is going to be necessary.”\n“M..mercy my General!”\n“Mercy? This is the infernal realm my dear, have you forgotten that? Apparently you need to be reminded of several important things and unfortunately for you, you are still useful to me, so death will be denied…but oh you will wish for it everyday…”\n\nThe Future…\n\n“General, we’re at a stand still with the abominations. We can’t attack without weakening our position. We need reinforcements from the Fortress of Torment.”\n\nAttack, counterattack, reinforce, repeat. That’s all you’ve been doing for the past few years. You’re sick of this quagmire and even more pissed that if things keep going this way, the abominations are probably going to slowly make progress through attrition eventually.\n\nEver since you left that place, you knew that you’d have to deal with it again someday.\n\nThat was never more apparent when Sinthinia showed up again to lead an attack on your territory. She wasn’t dead, but she certainly wasn’t an infernal anymore, let alone a succubus. She was some sort of transformed eldritch puppet spreading corruption to the land.\n\nYou might have been prepared to the point of paranoia, but that first lightning strike still caught you off guard and Sin’s continued relentless attacks on your territory certainly took its toll and still continues to.\n\nMany times, you’ve wished you had been strong enough to stay in that accursed place if only to finish her off. You’ve had the chance several times to correct that mistake, but it’s only resulted in more stand offs. Every time she gets away or cheats death is an insult.\n\nThe only positive is what territory you’ve managed to hold on to is firmly defended and disciplined. First thing you did when you came back was completely restructure and purge certain elements that you felt weren’t pulling their weight. Fear and respect are nice, but such things are still fleeting in a place like this.\n\nYour main way to correct this problem didn’t necessarily involve death (though there was a lot of that) but the improved method of completely removing free will.\n\nZeljinir was one of the few instrumental subordinates in coming up with a mass correcting technique involving infernal technology. Though of course you had to correct Zel’s own shortcomings yourself, but after you did, her focus was always on her work.\n\nNow, you have some of the most obedient minions in the infernal realm. Those that haven’t been corrected, at least fear enough of becoming so.\n\nOf course the downside of all this is most of your minions aren’t the most creative. You sometimes wish this wasn’t the case as even you know that the lowliest of soldiers benefit from thinking on their own for survival at times.\n\nEven Zel, who hasn’t had her mind completely stripped of independent thought, isn’t as creative as she probably could be. Every once in awhile there is a spark of imagination, but as it stands, most of her inventions focus on mundane practicality.\n\nHopefully that’s enough to at least help hold back the tide of chaos that continues assault your doorstep. You have enough problems with exterior strife, no need to have your attention divided to potential interior strife as well. There has to be some beacon of order in all this chaos.\n\nAnd a “beacon of order” is exactly what your territory has become since it isn’t like you’re the only target. The entire infernal realm is under attack by these unnatural horrors.\n\nPortions of it have begun to warp into something completely different. Something more akin to the invaders’ liking. Even native infernals are starting to transform if they aren’t killed outright.\n\nThe unseen (and almost mythical) so called “Lords of Hell” are supposed to be setting things in motion to repel this invasion, but you aren’t holding your breath on that. You’re on your own as usual.\n\nYou nod at your subordinate’s words.\n\n“Very well, pull our forces back and shore up our defenses and immediately send word to the Fortress for reinforcements.” You order.\n\nWith your orders acknowledged and to be carried out, you return to your own ideas on how to try to gain an advantage to break this stalemate.\n\nYour own goals of uniting the infernal realm under your command have been put on hold in favor of patience to endure this extended hindrance.\n\nBut then you’ve always been good at that at least.\n",
  "page 24": "You’ve already experienced being denied acts of violence twice, but somehow you do not feel there will be a third.\n\nCall it infernal instinct and throwing caution to the hells, but perhaps Arash’s warning of alterations of reality occurring also apply to alterations of the “rules” to this place.\n\nSo you focus all your willpower along with your rage and swing your sword at Posil. For the briefest moment he looks a little surprised that you actually did it and you’re surprised that it actually worked when you sever his head from his body.\n\nHowever, the surprises keep coming.\n\nPosil’s head falls to the ground and splatters into several large grubs that immediately try to crawl away. His body still stands before you and a large jagged mouth appears on his chest emanating a horrible scream. The scream is unlike anything you’ve experienced and it’s mildly hurting your ears and causing some disorientation.\n\nFortunately you’re no mere mortal that’s hindered by such things for very long and you blast Posil’s body with hellfire.\n\nPosil’s burning body begins to flail at you to which you respond to by dodging and chopping off one of his legs at the knee. Still screeching, he falls to the ground and manages to grab your ankle. Just as his fingers are transforming into tentacles to wrap around your leg better, you hack off his arm and pull his offending limb from you.\n\nBurning, screaming and bloody, Posil goes into a convulsing fit where upon he finally dies. You can tell due to his body just completely melting into a puddle of black ichor.\n\nNo sooner this has happen, when one of the angels cries out from the crowd.\n\n“She’s saved us! Don’t you see?! She can kill us all! This is the savior we’ve needed!” she says.\n“No! Death will mean oblivion!” another shouts.\n“Better oblivion than this never ending torment!”\n\nWhile several angels are arguing the pros and cons of you killing them, a third group is visibly unhappy and begins to move directly towards you.\n\n“Interloper! You will not succeed in stopping our return!” one of them says in a raspy voice as he begins to shake and grow an extra pair of arms and legs from odd place of his body. Those with him begin to do something similar. Surprisingly, some of the angels that were calling you a savior pounce on the deformed ones. Fighting breaks out between them and it would appear that the no violence rule no longer applies.\n\nIt’s becoming apparent that neither are the rules of reality as the landscape starts warping slightly around you. Before you still lies the door to the “Cells” where Sinthinia is and who you were here in the first place. It’s even open now, but you can’t see into it though, it’s just a black void.\n\nMeanwhile what angels that still remain are fighting amongst themselves. Some are calling on you to put an end to all this once and for all.\n\nYou’re not here to be any sort of savior however, you’re here to retrieve your enemy that’s escaped punishment.\n\nWith the celestials preoccupied, you enter the doorway. At first there is just darkness. Even behind you it’s dark, like the door you just stepped through didn’t even exist.\n\nSuddenly the floor (Or whatever it is you were standing on) disappears beneath you causing you to start flapping your wings though as you proceed, you feel like you’re flying through molasses at times.\n\nThe darkness soon becomes that gray color you were familiar with before you entered this place. As strange as this place is, it isn’t anything like what Arash was describing, but maybe it looks different to different people or maybe because he was human, who knows.\n\nThe only thing breaking up the gray are floating black cube shaped cages that look like they contain beings inside them. You’re guessing some invisible barrier is keeping them in and you since you presume Sinthinia is in one of these, you explore the closest one.\n\nYou get to it and see what looks to be an earth elemental. Not that you’ve had much contact with elemental types, but it’s obviously in pain given the low bellowing noises it occasionally makes. You can feel the vibrations even from outside the invisible barrier.\n\nHalf of it is a melted puddle of brown goo with the occasional small tentacle coming out and sinking back in. Its stony face looks at you with what could only be described as a mixture of agony and hopefulness that you’re here to free it.\n\nThen fleshy spider looking things crawl from where its eyes would be and you back away from the barrier.\n\nYou pass other cubes and see a couple more elemental types, some plane walker mortals of all types, you even see a vampire, but all of them without exception are undergoing some sort of horrible transformation.\n\nArash was right about some other race being here. This is not something the celestials created. This isn’t even infernal work. This is something very old and you need to find Sinthinia and get out of this place as fast as you can before something worse begins to stir.\n\nFlying (swimming?) through the gray is very disorientating and you’re trying to make a mental note of the cube locations so you can make your way back to the location of the doorway, but that’s a bit difficult when the cubes are slowly floating around.\n\nYou’re still looking for Sinthinia, and that’s when you hear a voice a familiar yet there’s a sing song tone to it.\n\n“Cistiagonijaaaa, where are yoooou…” Engan calls out.\n\nYou never told that silver bastard your name, but that hardly matters at this point. You’re being hunted and while you know Engan is searching for you, who knows how many other corrupted celestials are doing likewise.\n\n“You really should have come with me when you first arrived. I could have made this so much easier for you. But I still have hope for you. I know you’re not like other infernals. I could sense that. You have an orderly mind. I can tell you most here wouldn’t like that, but I find it alluring. More of a challenge. Don’t you agree it’s much more satisfying when a prize isn’t easy to take? When we join, you will be a great asset.”\n\nGreat, not content on just trying to kill you, this demented celestial is probably also trying to fuck you as well.\n\nYou continue to ignore Engan’s fat musings and keep alert. You soon come across another cube and just when you were thinking you were a fool for coming here, you see Sinthinia.\n\nOr at least what you think is her.\n\nSinthinia turns to look at you with all six of the new eyes in her face. While she’s no longer suffering from the burned skin brought on by celestial light you last saw, it’s been replaced by a greenish mucus covered layer instead.\n\nHer overall form is still similar though her limbs in general are now twisted and crooked to a point that she cannot possibly stand up straight and is currently in a semi-hunched kneeling sitting position.\n\nHer wings are gone. Replaced by some sort of fleshy hump on her back and as is common with all these transformations you’ve seen, she’s got a few tentacles growing out of her at odd places.\n\nWhile you can imagine some degenerates STILL finding this new form of hers appealing, her days of seducing the average mortal male (or female) are over.\n\nIf she still had a mouth, she’d most likely be screaming. As it stands, she’s putting her gnarly sticky claws against the invisible barrier keeping her in the cube and scratching at it. At first you believe she’s just trying to get at you, but then you notice she’s making gestures with her fingers in such a way to spell out “invisible” letters.\n\nK…I…L…L…M…E\n\nOver and over and over again.\n\n“I see you found your prize. Though I suppose she isn’t quite the same since the last time you saw her.” Engan says causing you to turn around.\n\nEngan still looks the same though his silver skin is a little duller, to the point where it’s starting to look the same shade of gray as everything around you, but he’s not spouting tentacles or anything like that yet.\n\nThough you’re fully expecting anything at this point.\n\n“I would think this would be a bit of a dilemma for you. In your limited infernal mind, this probably seems like a fate worse than death and as such is a fitting punishment. You could easily just leave her to rot here satisfied in the knowledge that your revenge has been served. However, you aren’t really interested in prolonging torment like most infernals are you? You dislike loose ends. You desired her death much more. In fact YOU wanted to carry it out personally. That is why you went to all this trouble isn’t it?”\n\nYou unleash a blast of hellfire at Engan, but as soon as you do, it turns into pixies, which then make little squealing sounds as they disintegrate into the gray. Engan smiles, but makes no move towards you, in fact he begins to float slightly away from you.\n\n“Laws of all kinds have no meaning here…well I suppose that isn’t entirely true. There still are a few, but soon that will change. That will change everywhere. You see it’s almost time. It’s time for the true masters to return and tear down the rotten systems in place. There will be no celestial realm, there will be no infernal realm, there will be no mortal realm, there will be no realms at all, only pure untamed chaos.”\n\nAt this point you hear the sounds of Sinthinia slamming against her cube’s force field aggressively. This is then followed by you quickly turning your attention back and forth to her and Engan.\n\n“I’ve heard about you and your attempts to bring order to your dismal realm. Impressive that you’ve been relatively successful considering your humble beginnings. Big Red has been most useful in that matter. Excellent mind that one, though I believe he thinks by making deals with the ancient ones he thinks he will somehow be exempt from their eventual success. He is quite wrong of course, but he shall be dealt with in time, after all the ancient ones are VERY patient.” Engan says.\n“You’re right about one thing, Big Red WILL be dealt with in time, but it’ll be me doing it.” You reply.\n\nEngan shakes his head at your response.\n\n“You still don’t understand. You have already lost. All of you have. Entropy is the natural state of everything. Even in the infernal realm, you pathetic horned degenerates still adhere to a semblance of order. And now through your actions, I hear infernals are becoming more like celestials every moment just with a better sense of humor. Fitting I suppose, given the origins of both. I’m telling you though, when the ancients return, the infernal realm will not be able to stand against us. After it’s done, even the memory of the infernals will not exist.”\n\nYou fly towards Engan as you’re completely done with his need to pontificate about things that haven’t even come to pass, but once again he floats backwards and disappears into the gray immediately.\n\nYou quickly look around expecting him to attack, but instead you just get more talking, which is actually worse.\n\n“I can see the only way you’re going to be able to see the truth is by direct action. Well we can oblige. Perhaps your prey can show you up close and personal.”\n\nAnd that’s when you hear Sinthinia release an unnatural wailing and you narrowly dodge out of the way as she lunges out of the cube she was previously locked in. Her form seems to be changing before your eyes as now a large mouth has appeared where her stomach would be and more tentacles have emerged from her body.\n\n“Cista...let me show you the horrible beauty that surpasses even the most terrible tortures of the infernal realm…” Sin utters from her new mouth, though her voice is changing several tones and at times there is an echo of the same words. This along with the whole unnaturalness of this place is once again starting to fuck with your head even worse now.\n\n“Cista, I’ve secretly always wanted you to be inside me, let us finally put aside our differences and make that come true.” Sin adds and severalof her new tentacles from her body attempt to grab you.\n\nYou dodge a few tentacles and chop off a couple with a sword blow. At least your sword is still working properly even if your magic isn’t again.\n\nWhat isn’t working is your concentration as you begin hearing the gibbering and caterwauling of more abominations approaching. Engan has apparently released the inhabitants of the other cells as well and right now they’re all converging on your position. You need to retreat.\n\nHowever all those abominations are coming from the direction that you last remembered the entrance is located, you’ll have to dodge and fight your way through. Not that you’d normally have an issue with that, but the mental onslaught is going to make it more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nOf course heading in the opposite direction is just going to get you deeper in this place to who knows where, if indeed it has an end at all. Maybe you can try to backtrack a long way around them though.\n\nUnfortunately neither choice is a sure thing as far as actually finding the entrance again.\n",
  "page 25": "This goes against every part of your being, but you feel like you’re getting drawn into a trap and every moment you stay here increases the danger that you won’t be able to return.\n\nYou start to back away which naturally causes Posil to smirk and proceed to mock you.\n\n“Hah! That’s what I thought! You infernals talk and you talk, but when it comes down to it, you’re all a bunch of cowards when in the face of a superior being! Run infernal, run! Look everyone, look at the infernal run!” Posil exclaims.\n\nAt this point the crowd of angels begins to step closer and much like how you saw Posil, you now start to see them very briefly change into other “things” then back to their angel form as well.\n\nYou begin to really feel threatened and start shouting at all of them to get back, swinging your sword at them. They start to stay their distance. A couple of them even make shrieking sounds that definitely don’t sound like something an angel would make.\n\nEventually you’re out of immediate danger of the crowd of angels which are all now just staring at you. Posil is flying above them, continuing with his mocking.\n\n“Leaving then? Come on, don’t be like that. I was just jesting. Even an infernal like you deserves this chance. We have such wonderful things to show you. Such beautiful things. You should really stay. What say you everyone? Shouldn’t she stay?”\n“Yes stay. Stay with us. Forever, and ever and ever.” The group says in a creepy tone. (Completely in unison)\n\nYou don’t know what this place is or who these being are exactly, but they are NOT celestials and now your mind is feeling assaulted.\n\n“Running won’t help. Hiding won’t help. What is coming is inevitable. The ancient ones will awaken soon.”\n\n“GET OUT OF MY FUCKING HEAD!” you shout and fly as fast as you can out of this cursed village and back to where you originally came in.\n\nAs you’re speeding away and trying to shut out the voices still invading your mind, you fumble about with getting the beacon stone to open up the portal.\n\nYou open the portal and fly in without stopping.\n\nWhen you arrive, you’re back in the room where Zel first opened it up for you. Nobody is around which paired with your already heightened state of readiness you make a somewhat terrible mistake…\n\n“You went by so fast, I nearly didn’t get…”\n\nThis is all Arash manages to say before you swing around with your sword and chop half of his head off. His body slumps to the floor as his brain matter splatters partially on the wall and on the floor.\n\n“Shit! Fuck! Damn it!” you exclaim after calming down from the initial surprise.\n\nYou were so busy trying to leave that place, you forgot all about Arash. You didn’t even see him waiting for you, but he must have hopped into the portal right after you entered it.\n\nYou really didn’t mean to kill him, in fact given the deal you made with him, it wouldn’t have been in your interest to kill him. At least not without a loophole, let alone directly.\n\nBreaking deals has consequences for your kind, hence also why your kind doesn’t make them very often and even then excel in double speak and lies.\n\nWhile breaking a minor deal with a mortal isn’t going to kill you, you’re already feeling a slight loss in your power. On top of already having your mind shaken by the abominations that infested the place you just came from, you curse yourself for experiencing such weakness.\n\nYou even feel a little sick. Some of your soldiers rush in finally to see what’s going on at which point you tell them to get the fuck out of your way as you need to prepare for the next campaign.\n\nIn truth, you just want to go back to your own war tent where you can rest a bit and gather your strength until you can feel a little more like yourself.\n\nLater after resting up, you still don’t feel like yourself. You probably won’t feel up to your old power for some time. You definitely cannot give anyone the impression of this loss. Infernals are all too eager to backstab each other at the best of times, let alone if they perceive weakness.\n\nOn top of all this, you’ve got concerns about what you just saw in the other realm you just came from. There was a strong indication that whatever those being are, they won’t be just content sticking around in that pocket dimension forever. You need to prepare for that, on top of your initial impossible goal of unifying the infernal realm.\n\nYou just don’t know though. You’re so unsure of everything now. You hate this pathetic indecisiveness and lack of confidence you’re experiencing. This isn’t you.\n\nWhile you’re struggling with your future plans, you get a cautious visit from Captain Spol of all people.\n\n“Um, general? Are you busy? I wouldn’t bother you, but I felt this was something important.” He says.\n“What? And speak quickly!” you snap.\n“Yes general. Reports say that this area has been completely secured. Most of Sinthinia’s remaining hold outs are either dead, being tortured or run off. It seems though however there have been sightings of Baron Yargvid’s troops on the borders. They haven’t made a move yet, looks like they’ve been observing, but we weren’t sure what you wanted to do next.”\n\nYou quickly clear your head and answer Spol with brief order of sending a detachment along the border and to call in other captains to give reports so you can start planning your next conquest.\n\nCaptain Spol nods, but before he leaves you call out to him asking if he’s seen Zel since she wasn’t at her post when you arrived back home.\n\n“No, you told me to stay away so I did. I assume she might be working on repairing the siege engines though.” Captain Spol replies.\n“Hm. Well if you bump into her or anyone else that knows where she is, tell her to get her ass over here since I need to discuss something with her as well. Dismissed.” You reply.\n\nCaptain Spol nods again and leaves.\n\nYou doubt if Spol hasn’t seen Zel. Probably were fucking while you were away, but you’ve honestly got bigger problems right now than potential minor insubordination issues.\n\nThe Future…\n\nYou look down at the ground squashing a small crawling scorder under foot reflecting back at how you came to this lowly state of hiding in a fucking cave in the middle of nowhere.\n\nWhile it’s easy to blame all this on breaking your deal with Arash, it really wasn’t the only thing. It’s never just one thing.\n\nWhile you certainly did lose power, it was more that you let the idea of power loss get into your head. You became distracted and second guessing yourself at nearly every major decision. You became paranoid to an unreasonable degree, but at the same time you had to rely on putting on a stronger front than you actually had.\n\nDespite all that, you probably COULD have faked it long enough to get your shit together. Might have taken your goals a bit longer, but it was possible. After all, you had to resort to a bit of bluffing when you were climbing the ladder to power in the beginning.\n\nWhat ruined everything though was the invasion. The abominations from that place you barely escaped from finally arrived. You knew it was coming and you even tried to prepare for it, but due to your instability at the time, it was always pushed back to take care of other things you thought were of more immediate importance.\n\nWhen the invasion came, your territory was the first to be targeted and it was devastating even with your minor preparations in place. Didn’t help that Sinthinia lead the assault, of course she didn’t look much like herself anymore. She wasn’t an infernal anymore, not even in the superficial way. She had completely been twisted by the old ones and just a tool for their pursuit of absolute entropy.\n\nIt was during one of your clashes with her when things got even worse. Sinthina’s changes had made her more powerful while you were still struggling with your own losses. She nearly killed you in that last battle with her and sometimes you wish she had because what came next was even worse.\n\nCaptain Spolnapad who had somehow got on your “good side” by making himself a completely obedient officer to you, even helping you maintain order over those that were whispering about your ability to lead at times.\n\nHonestly, his “selfless subservience” to you probably should have been your first clue that he was plotting the biggest betrayal of all.\n\nHe saved your life with new weapon developed by that equally traitorous bitch Zeljenir. Or rather reverse engineered it from the weapons that Arash’s dead body was carrying on him. Apparently the two discovered them and kept it secret. Or at least Spol did and probably charmed Zel into going along with it like the dumb whore she was.\n\nAfter he vaporized Sinthinia he led a successful counter attack against the abominations. The first in a long time of the initial invasion. Spol of course was hailed as “savior” and you were viewed as a failure.\n\nHe wasted little time in ordering that you be executed for your inability to lead anymore. You barely escaped, but you have been forever hunted ever since. If not by Spol’s people, then by other opportunists for various reasons.\n\nNot that killing you will do much to help anyone’s position at this point. You have no allies or territory anymore. All of those were destroyed or taken long ago. In fact despite everything, the infernal realm is more fractured than ever which puts it in an even worse position than it was before since the ancient ones haven’t ceased their own invasion.\n\nIn fact they’ve been building strength even with the new weapons used against them. How do you know?\n\nBecause they’re right here. Maybe not right here with you in this cave, but you can sense them in this area.\n\nThe Red Wastes have always been considered of little worth even from a strategic perspective. The area is one of the more hostile areas of the infernal realms and has little worth in general. Indeed that’s one of the reasons why you decided to hide here.\n\nBut the invaders are here, in fact if you had to guess, besides attacking your territory first, they probably established a presence here as well knowing they could stay undetected for a long time.\n\nAnd they know YOU’RE here as well. You hear the voices. They’ve been trying to talk to you for quite some time. Promising you revenge, promising you a return to greatness, promising you a place in the new order.\n\nThey speak to you even now.\n\n“Join us. Become part of the inevitable future…”\n\nYou assume despite your outcast status, you would be a great asset to their invasion effort. You don’t know why they haven’t just tried to take you by force though. Their numbers are growing every moment you and while you’ve long since regained your powers, you’d never be able to outlast such a horde by yourself.\n\nPerhaps they wish to drive you mad first. Insanity does seem to a major character trait for those affected.\n\nYou might even be half way there already, indeed there is part of you that has almost decided give in. Joining these ancient ones would be a way to regain what was lost.\n\nBut no. As tempting as it might be to just throw your lot in with ancient horrors for revenge on the entire infernal realm, that isn’t your path.\n\nYou can’t stay here though, the abominations aren’t going to allow your continued presence forever and even if they do, you don’t know if you have the willpower to fight off their insane babbling.\n\nWhere you’ll go, you have no idea, but one thing is certain, you aren’t dead and out of this conflict yet. You’ll climb back to the top eventually.\n\nIt’s just a matter of time.\n",
  "page 28": "It’s hard enough to think and move in this place, let alone focus on fighting multiple opponents, you decide to try to lose them and double back.\n\nYou glide as fast as you can through this gray haze, eventually you lose sight of any abominations or Sinthinia that may still be following you, but the voices are still there, if anything they’re getting unbearably louder. Your attempts of shutting them out are failing completely.\n\nJust as you’re about to make your way back into the direction of the entrance, everything around you goes black. An oppressive feeling dread hits you and you try gliding back, but you might as well be just running in one spot at this point as you feel a force definitely pull you back.\n\nThe voices have stopped, but have been replaced by a single deep one that’s almost making your brain vibrate in its skull. You don’t know the language but it hardly matters since it feels like you head is about to explode.\n\nAnd then you finally the darkness lifts just enough for you see what you’re being drawn to and you really wish you hadn’t.\n\nEven all your time in the infernal realm hasn’t prepared you for this level of horror. Your mind instantly snaps in the face of your doom and you begin to laugh as you’re inevitably drawn towards this thing’s mouth or whatever orifice it is.\n\nOnce again, it doesn’t matter since you never come out.\n",
  "page 27": "Going deeper into this gray shit seems like a great way of getting even more lost and eventually losing your endurance given how this place is doing its best to try to sap your energy physically and mentally.\n\nYou might as well put what strength you have now to good use and you certainly aren’t lacking in that yet.\n\n“You want me inside you Sin? Fine, let’s make it a date.” You say and intend on making Sin your first casualty.\n\nDespite Sin’s new transformation she’s still not much of a fighter. She does her lunge attack again which you easily dodge and bring your sword down on one of the fleshy lumps on her back. Predictably it splits open unleashing all sorts of nastiness in the form of oversized bloody maggots with distorted faces all over them.\nA few of them latch on to you and you’re really glad you’re wearing armor right now because they start chewing through it almost immediately. You quickly grab them off of you and toss them into the gray.\n\nWhile Sin is attempting to turn around to attack, you strike again, running your sword through her back and out the new mouth that formed on the front of her body, you then pull upward as hard as you can, splitting her nearly in half as your sword carves up through her chest and out where her shoulder and neck meet.\n\nSin unleashes an ear-piercing wail that causes you to reel backwards. A single long tentacle of hers wraps around your leg, but you chop it off before it can drag you back towards Sin who now is just a bloody mess of flailing limbs attached to a large piece of flesh.\n\nWith the other abominations closing in, you figure you’ll have to be satisfied with this amount of revenge on Sin and proceed towards your escape.\n\nFirst one that comes near, you manage to carve up while still not slowing down too much. After two more encounters like this, you can see one of the cubes floating in the distance. You really hope you’re heading in the right direction and this place hasn’t decided to completely change reality again.\n\nAnd then it does.\n\nSuddenly you find yourself no longer in an endless gray sea. Solid ground lies beneath you. Grass, blue sky, flowers, trees, looks like a mortal world. Nearby is a city, which looks painfully familiar.\n\n“No Not real.” you whisper.\n\nThen it flashes back to the gray again.\n\nYou’re about to continue to the next floating cube you see in the distance and that’s when you hear Engan again.\n\n“But it could be real. Anything can be real. You’re only seeing grotesque horrors because you’re because you’re giving off hostility. If you stopped fighting for one moment, you would see that the ancients can allow you to experience wonderful things.” Engan’s voice says.\n\nYou ignore these words and just continue towards where you believe is the exit. Engan doesn’t stop talking of course.\n\n“I know, THEY know all about you Cista. You weren’t always what you were now. They know how you suffer; you could eliminate that suffering and put away your struggles. Think about it. Don’t you get tired of always having to fight all the time?”\nYour mind begins to slip and wander to simpler times in your past. You try to focus, but it’s incredibly difficult. Your mind’s defenses are starting to weaken.\n\n“All your life has been one big struggle with no end in sight. Your very nature has doomed you to such a fate. Even if you manage to escape from here, you will not avoid what is coming. Even if you managed to succeed in your impossible task to unite the infernal realm, you still would not be satisfied. The ancients WILL rise again and the infernal realm is going to one of the first places on the agenda to target.”\n\nYou get ambushed by an abomination while lost in thought. Your armor manages to absorb the blow, but it still feels like a crushing weight hitting your chest. You dodge its next attack and chop off a few of the thing’s extra limbs followed by part of its head (or what’s passing for its head at least)\n\nYou’re then attacked by another one latching on to your back and you feel your armor starting to weaken as one of its set of jaws sink in between your shoulder and neck. You give it a few blind punches to its face. You can’t quite see what you’re doing due to the angle, but you soon realize you’ve literally smashed its face into mush as the solidness becomes less so, causing it to release its grip.\n\nYou follow up with a spinning sword strike, chopping it in half before flying away from both of them.\n\n“Join us and I promise you, the ancients will reward you. The ancients can change your nature, they can change reality! You’re seeing this right now! I’ve seen this many times, it’s why I abandoned to petty laws and misguided concepts of morality of the celestial realm. The heavens, the hells, the mortal realms, EVERYTHING can be changed for the better. Why would you fight against a better future when you could have a place in it?”\n\nYou see it, you see the door. It’s a distance away, but you see it. You instantly fly towards the only beacon of brightness in all this gray.\n\nEngan suddenly appears right in front of you and before you can even react, your mind is completely overcome by feelings of sadness and hopelessness. Feelings you haven’t experienced in…well quite a long time.\n\nYour surroundings change again. This time the sky is red, the ground is red and the temperature is much hotter. Looks like the infernal realm, but of course you know it isn’t. Doesn’t change your current negative feelings though. You feel this overwhelming urge to start crying.\n\n“You know what you’re feeling right now? You’re feeling the weight of all your guilt, sadness, and regret. You may be able to keep those weaknesses locked away, but they are never really gone are they? They constantly torment you. I tell you again, you can shed all of that and be part of the new order that is to come.”\n\nYou begin to feel actual tears running from your eyes. You even drop to one knee as if all the things Engan is describing are literally on your back right now. It isn’t just things from before either, it’s also things you’ve done to achieve your position. You’ve been an embodiment of violence and war for quite some time now and it hasn’t all just been against other demon assholes. You’ve committed so many atrocities in general that you’ve lost count, but not really. It’s all still there in your mind. You just don’t think about it.\n\nAnd despite having the fiery blood of hell in your veins, there’s still that tiny speck, that weak spot that maintains all those feelings that you would like to get rid of, to make everything much easier.\n\nYou can barely hold your sword anymore, you look up and see Engan hovering slightly above and in front of you, extending his hand.\n\n“This is the place you call home. The infernal realm feeds on suffering and pain, and despite being an apex predator in it; YOU are merely still just prized livestock. In fact the higher your position, the greater your inevitable downfall, leading to the greater the feast. You don’t need to go back to it though. You don’t need to experience your personal hell ever again. It can ALL go away. Join us, and you’ll never have to endure this torment ever again. Just take my hand.”\n\nYou know this has to be a trick. You know it, but you’re struggling not to give in. You need to get out of here and despite Engan being in your way, the door isn’t far.\n\nYou also know that Engan has a tendency to just teleport away from your attacks, but maybe if you took his hand you’d prevent that from happening and could finally get a solid hit in and at least weaken this power draining you.\n",

  "page 141": "You’re not going to just wait until she blows the walls apart; you step out of cover and begin unleashing your own barrage of offensive spells.\n\nMaggie puts up a magic shield to stop your attacks, but you don’t let up, you won’t let her get a chance to retaliate.\n\nEventually you hit her with a blast so strong, it pushes her off balance and her magic shield goes down as she awkwardly attempts to not fall down on her stomach.\n\nYou allow yourself a small smile as her concern for her unborn child has put her at a disadvantage, you prepare to finish her off, but you are then suddenly hit by a jolt of lightning. It’s not a fatal hit or even one serious enough to cause permanent damage, but it knocks you to the ground.\n\nDavid, who wasn’t quite dead yet, managed to unleash one last attack of his own to help his wife. He sees you fall and then collapses back into unconsciousness for the last time.\n\nYou attempt to get back up but this distraction was all Maggie needed to recover and now you’re no longer in cover.\n\nYou feel a great force, which slams you into a nearby wall.

This time it feels like your skull and bones being crushed against the wall and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nWell that’s definitely not how that battle went.

  "page 142": "You’ve never been one to just go head first into battle without a plan of some sort, besides Maggie’s not the only one in there. Her husband might be at death’s door, but knowing how things can go to shit quickly, it would be just your luck that he recovers enough to help out his wife if you step in there.\n\nYou move over from the portion of wall you’re behind since you fully expect Maggie to bring it down, but then you hear someone say something and then the attacks stop.\n\nYou then see a bright light appear at the entryway to the room, and then hear movement in the portal room.\n\nYou cautiously approach the entryway and find that they’ve erected a magical barrier. David is still on the floor and Maggie has gone back to attempting to fix one of the portals to escape.\n\nYou don’t think you’d get through this barrier before Maggie can fix the portal, but you’ve got an idea.\n\nDavid’s dead. You can tell his life force has finally let go of his mortal shell. You don’t think Maggie’s even realized it yet since she’s focused on getting the portal working. It doesn’t matter though; it won’t change what you’re going to do.\n\nYou focus…\n\nMaggie says something about getting out of Nuro soon.\n\nDavid’s body sits up.\n\nMaggie turns around briefly and sees David sitting up. She tells him to just rest and to save his strength. She says she’s got everything under control before returning to work on the portal. She doesn’t realize David isn’t even alive anymore.\n\nDavid stands up and begins to walk towards Maggie. You begin your attempt of bringing down the barrier.\n\n“David, I said save your…David wha…BY THE GODS! NO!” you hear Maggie scream followed by nonsensical groans by David’s corpse.\n\nA physical scuffle ensues. You doubt if David’s corpse is going to kill her, but it’s enough of a distraction to give you time to get the barrier down.\n\nBy the time you get back in the room, Maggie has managed to dispatch her husband’s corpse, which is now beheaded. She stands before you with some sort of magic blade in her hand.\n\n“You evil bitch! I’m going to…argh…agh…” Maggie starts to clutch her belly and begins bleeding. Apparently the high stress and physical trauma of this whole situation has finally taken a toll on her condition. Her magic blade disappears, as her concentration is broken.\n\nShe falls to the floor in pain and you walk slowly over to her. She somehow manages to cast a few bolts at you, but you easily block them with a magic shield.\n\n“Your baby has joined your husband.” You say.\n“Fuck you! Fuck you!” Maggie cries.\n“This could have been easier for you all, but don’t worry. You’ll ALL be together soon.”\n\nYou focus…\n\nMaggie begins clutching her belly again as the pain becomes unbearable. She screams out as her dead child is dead no longer.\n\nThe result is gory and horrific as the undead half formed infant rips its mother’s insides up attempting to get out in a non-traditional way.\n\nMaggie’s screams become dying wails mixed with coughs of blood, she lives long enough to see the baby rip through her stomach. The undead abomination crawls out making unnatural growls.\n\n“Congratulations. It’s a boy.” You say and then walk away having accomplished your task.\n\nNow you can only hope that Mr. Demar and Azrael have accomplished their own goals.\n\nYou make your way back to the administration building, which looks even more destroyed than when you left it. However, you notice it’s the new library where you’re hearing the sounds of battle now. You aren’t sure how the battle transferred to there, but you imagine the huge hole in the side of the library has something to do with it.\n\nYou enter the library through the large hole and see the sight of two men throwing spells at each other. Amazing stamina for their age, but much to your dismay, Mr. Demar doesn’t look like he has the upper hand.\n\nYou see Mr. Demar struggling to block the dean’s attacks. He trips over a fallen bookshelf giving the dean time to hit him with several magic bolts before he can shield himself.\n\nFortunately the dean is so busy trying to kill Mr. Demar, he doesn’t see you at all and you set him on fire with a cone of flame to his back. The unexpected immolation causes him to scream and panic which considering he’s surrounded by books, the fire just spreads even more.\n\nHe soon collapses and you put out the fire with a strong gust of frosty wind. You hope that’s it, because you’re exhausted.\n\nYou go over to Mr. Demar who is struggling to get up, but he doesn’t look well. He’s bloody and burned severely. You help him up.\n\n“Thanks…ugh…I could’ve taken that bastard if…only been a little younger and…agh…” Mr. Demar says clutching his side.\n“Save your strength, he’s dead now. The battle’s been won.” You say.\n“You succeeded in your task then?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good. What about Azrael?”\n“I don’t know. Though I haven’t noticed any more temporal anomalies so maybe that’s a good sign.”\n“Maybe…help me over to that chair.”\n\nAs you assist Mr. Demar, you can’t help but look at him in a completely different light. You once respected this man a great deal, and if you’re being honest with yourself, you were even attracted to his skill in necromancy.\n\nBut now? You see nothing but a frail old man who made many mistakes in his pursuit to rule. Maybe his will was stronger than his body, which will soon be joining the way of all flesh.\n\nStill, there is always a beauty in that.\n\n“Catalina…” Mr. Demar says as he gets to the chair.\n“Yes?” you respond.\n“You could probably still get out of here and start a new life for yourself. I doubt if anyone would know who you are.”\n“Hm, perhaps. But Nuro has always been my home. The death and destruction on a grand scale has now made it seem even more like home. This is where I belong.”\n“You’re a strange girl Cat…so do you intend on taking over the Dark Order?”\n“Mr. Demar, we could still heal your wounds.”\n“No. That’s only going to prolong the inevitable. My plan didn’t go as planned and I’m tired. Very tired. I just don’t have the motivation or energy to go on. Listen, if you intend on staying, then you will need to take over what remains of the Dark Order. You’re the most skilled wizard in it.”\n“What about Azrael? He’s become quite… shall I say confident in the couple times I’ve seen him during the battle.”\n“Ah yes, the savant. Well if he lives, then I’d advise that you use him as a powerful weapon and point him in the direction of your enemies. If his power is growing the way it seems to be, I believe he will be a bigger target. Sometimes you can run things without being the leader. Maybe that’s what I should have done.”\n“What makes you think he’ll listen to me?”\n\nMr. Demar laughs.\n\n“You’re joking right? The boy obviously has passion for you and I don’t think it’s just physical. Azrael, Trelik, Sebastian, you really are a heart breaker aren’t you? Strange that you don’t age like most necromancers of your power. Even as young as you are, you would start displaying the signs like gray or white hair, wrinkles and such. Potentially looking like someone at least five years or a decade older. You using magic to hide your true appearance? Trelik did that, I’m sure so did Irwin.”\n“No. Never occurred to me.”\n“Hm, interesting. Wonder if it’s due to your affinity to nature magic, or maybe you’re just lucky…agh… I’m just going to rest here a moment. You should start securing what remains of the city. If you see Azrael though, send him to me. Hopefully I’ll be around to speak to him one last time.”\n\nYou nod and begin to take your leave.\n\n“Goodbye Catalina. I hope your desires, whatever they may ultimately be come true. And you were right. We did win.” You hear Mr. Demar say.\n\nYou exit the library wondering what your next move should be. You see a couple of figures dressed in red robes approaching you. They’re demonologists. You’re not sure if you should be glad to see some of them survived, you suppose you’ll see if they attack or not.\n\n“Hey! You’re that necromancer girl, Catalina right?” one of them asks.\n“Yes. Can’t say I remember either of you though.” You respond.\n“Oh my name is Hessan and this is Belial. Is that other necromancer still alive? I ran into him earlier after he wiped out Nuro’s remaining security. Azzy or something.”\n“Azrael. And I don’t know yet, but I imagine he’ll pop up. So what’s with all the questions and do you have any info on the status of the rest of the city?”\n\nHessan goes into some detail of what the situation with the rest of the city as well surviving members of the Dark Order. He mentions that most of the demonologists still alive are ready to switch over to necromancy since it seems more reliable than summoning demons. (Including himself)\n\nAll of this is good news since you weren’t exactly thrilled with the idea of having demonologists in the Dark Order given their spectacular failure during this battle. You tell Belial that he should find the rest of his fellow demonologists and tell them to come back to the university immediately so defenses can be prepared.\n\nAfter Belial leaves, you continue speaking with Hessan who goes on to say that the city is half destroyed, but all resistance is gone. You thank him for the information and tell him to go help Belial. You then suddenly sense a strong aura of death approaching.\n\nYou turn your head and see Azrael with a small horde of dead behind him. He survived just like you figured.\n\n“Huh, took you long enough. You missed all the major battle while you were playing around with Quayle.” You say.\n“Playing around? You don’t even want to know what I’ve been through, and I’ll wager it wasn’t nearly as…disturbing as what you went through.” Azrael replies.\n“Doubt it, by the time I got here Mr. Demar had already lost Felsa, Trelik had betrayed him, and Sebastian was killed. Luckily I was here to provide back up for the final battle with the Dean. We’ve won, but Mr. Demar is very weak right now, I dunno if he’s going to survive his wounds.”\n“Shit, sounds like I did miss a lot, so is Trelik dead?”\n“Nope, the coward ran off when he realized he couldn’t beat Mr. Demar.”\n“Can I see him?”\n“Sure I guess, he’s in library, or what’s left of it.”\n\nYou watch Azrael enter the library after commanding his dead to stay put. Your mind begins forming plans and ideas of what you’re going to do next. It’s almost a bit overwhelming.\n\nBut somehow you feel confident that one of the biggest obstacles has been overcome. You now have a home where you can do whatever you want. There is no limitation or hiding any longer. You can truly appreciate the beauty of death as it is all around you now.\n\nYou know you’re going to have to defend your home, but when haven’t you had to fight against those that would try to limit you? This will be no different and you aren’t going to shy away from the challenge.\n\nEventually you see Azrael come back out of the library.\n\n“So what’s going on?” you ask.\n“I’m in charge, that’s what’s going on.” Azrael replies.\n\nYou’re still a little surprised by how blunt Azrael’s gotten about his ambition, but that surprise is disappearing much quicker now. He’s definitely going to be a useful weapon in the struggles to come. You’ll just need to guide him a bit.\n\n“Well, I suppose we could do worse…so what’s next fearless leader?”\n“Good question.”\n\nWell maybe a lot.\n",
  "page 167": "You look at these traitors with contempt, but they have a numerical superiority and as powerful as you are, you don’t think you’d be able to take them all out.\n\nOne thing you can see though is despite most of them trying to give you intimidating looks, they’re ALL afraid. They all made pacts with hell that they most certainly didn’t honor and it isn’t going to go well for them when they die. (Honestly it wouldn’t have gone well for them regardless, but you imagine it will definitely be worse now)\n\nHessan might be the only honest one in that regard.\n\nHe’s also not wrong about you either.\n\nYou don’t dwell on it much, but there is small part of you that fears death despite your love of it. There have been times when you’ve been around Azrael and you’ve felt fear. Being around the being he’s become (and still becoming) is a bit intimidating at times, but it’s not just that.\n\n“You’re right Hessan, I do have some fears about Azrael.” You say.\n\nYour admission seems to surprise everyone. Hessan even looks a bit hopeful now.\n\n“Then…you do understand!” he remarks.\n“Yes. I understand why you’re all afraid of death, but you don’t understand why I am.” You say.\n\nNow Hessan’s face loses the optimistic expression again.\n\n“I’m not afraid of death because I’m afraid of where I’m going. I’m afraid of what I’ll be leaving behind. This city is practically all I’ve ever known. I’ve barely ever left these walls and I still don’t have any desire to if I can help it. The comfort this place has brought to my life and especially after its lovely transformation has been just one of the major blessings I’ve experienced. The second would be Azrael. The thought of leaving him is an even more difficult concept to accept, but I’m getting there.”\n“But…you could become a lich! That’s what we all can do!” Hessan says.\n“No. When my time comes, I will embrace its beauty and ascend to that next stage, whatever that may be. Much like how a coffinpillar becomes a gravewing, I’m not afraid of that.” You say.\n\nBelial says something again about you being crazy, causing Hessan to once again tell him to be quiet. You continue to speak.\n\n“Now, Hessan, I believe that you came to me in good faith. You’ve always been the most competent of the Dark Order. I can talk to Azrael, but I can’t guarantee anything. It’s the best I can offer. However, I will say, if you lot have plans on killing me as some act of pettiness, I probably wouldn’t be able to take all of you on.”\n“Damn right you wouldn’t.” Belial snorts.\n“However, I would imagine the retribution Azrael would bring down on my killers would be considerable and excruciating. I suppose that would be one way to ensure your life though since I imagine he’d keep you alive to suffer for as long as possible. And then on top of all that, you have hell to look forward to.”\n“What makes you so sure we couldn’t beat your dead lover?”\n\nYou laugh.\n\n“If you really believed that Belial, you wouldn’t have come here with Hessan who is begging me to try to whisper mercy into my beloved’s ear. Try to kill me if you wish, but as I’ve already said, you’ll gain nothing from it other than beloved’s wrath.”\n\nYour words only server to anger Belial and a few others further, but Hessan once again shakes his head.\n\n“Are you fools!? This woman is literally the only thing that might save us!” Hessan shouts.\n“Are you a fucking coward? You really think she’s going to talk to Azrael about this incident in a positive light? It’s obvious he’s going to kill us all anyway at this point, I say we get some form of revenge ahead of time by killing this bitch! Who cares if he tortures us? We’re already going to face worse in hell anyway!” Belial exclaims.\n“And I’m not going to let YOU potentially fuck up MY chance of immortality!”\n\nHessan unleashes a blast of dark energy at Belial, catching him off guard. He drops to the ground as a husk of his former self. A few other Dark Order members start hurling spells of their own. Amazingly they’ve all forgotten about you and are too busy trying to kill each other. You just sort of back away behind a spell shield and watch the mayhem.\n\nAfter a few more bodies drop, Hessan and those that agree with his plan manage to win the infighting. He looks over at you.\n\n“So you’ll talk to Azrael?” Hessan asks.\n“I will.” You answer.\n\nHessan nods and with that he and the rest of the Dark Order leaves. You return to solitude of your garden.\n\nAbout a day later, Azrael returns home.\n\n“Hello Azrael. I trust the purge of that dwarven stronghold went well.” You say.\n“Yeah, hardy, stubborn little bastards. Lot of anti-magic runes. Anyway, nothing happened here I trust.” Azrael says.\n“Oh actually something did. The Dark Order came here making demands.”\n“WHAT?!”\n“Oh yes, they were quite insistent on certain things. They couldn’t agree on what though, so a fight broke out. Anyway I’m fine and they all went back to their homes I imagine.”\n“Those traitorous assholes! They’re lucky I even allow them to rule over their lands. Well no more, we haven’t needed any of them for decades, one wonders if we ever did. I’m going to pay each one of them a visit now!”\n“I left a list on your desk of which ones are still alive.”\n“Huh? Oh thanks, I’ll grab it before I go.”\n“Oh, one more thing. Hessan tried to be a voice of reason, if misguided. Make his death quick and painless. He deserves that much.”\n“Alright.”\n\nAzrael kisses you before leaving to make the world more beautiful.\n\nYou suppose you’ll have to eventually tell Azrael that you won’t be becoming a lich, but for now this distraction will give you time to figure out how to tell him.\n\nIt will undoubtedly be the hardest thing you’ll have to do, but you’ll get through it. You both will.\n",
  "page 166": "You lay in your bed watching a single gravewing fly around your room. It’s the last one left. All of its fellows have died.\n\nEventually it lands near your hand, its glowing starting to dim Won’t be long now. Won’t be long for you either.\n\nAzrael’s aura is killing the world. What life remains is but a fraction of what once was. You imagine in a few decades all major forms of life will be extinct. In a century? All life of any kind. A pity you won’t be around to witness such beauty.\n\nYour own powers can no longer sustain or protect you, but you knew they couldn’t hold forever. You don’t have any regrets and you have no fears. This is how it was always meant to be. This was how it was always going to end.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou see Azrael enter the room. He knows too. He gently strokes your hair and holds your hand. You’ll miss that cold touch. He never lost his feelings for you. He never lost that love. And neither did you.\n\nThat’s how you know you made the right decisions.\n\nStill, there is a part of you that’s sorry you can’t stay with him, even if he wants you to. “Life” as a lich however, just wouldn’t be the same. You would lose that spark and even Azrael knows, that only he can live forever.\n\nYou and Azrael exchange a few words. You don’t need many though; you know how each other feels. It feels a little silly, but you still can’t help but worry about his well-being.\n\n“Are you going to be alright? I mean what are you going to do?” you ask.\n“Me? I’ll be fine. I’ll stick around and oversee things I guess. Watch the world die. I have to carry this out to end.” Azrael responds.\n“I know you do…maybe we’ll meet again? On the other side?”\n“I’m sure if it’s possible. We will.”\n\nYour eyes briefly glance over to the gravewing. You see it glow one last time, then cease altogether.\n\n“I love you…” you say as everything starts to dim.\n\nYou feel Azrael’s cold lips touch yours one last time and everything goes black.\n",
  "page 168": "NecRomantic\n\n\nYou look around and see Azrael standing before you and you embrace him. Even in your incorporeal form you can feel his presence as if you were solid.\n\n“I see you finally made it back to me again.” Azrael says.\n“I always will.” You answer.\n\nYou know you don’t have much time, but what time you do have, you make the most of. Azrael mostly goes on about what he’s been doing.\n\nSomething about a potential war on a cosmic scale and mentions it’s a really big deal. You aren’t entirely sure what it’s all about, but you’re spending time with him and he tells you that it’s nothing that you have to worry about, and that’s good enough for you.\n\nYou also spend time reminiscing about your “old life” with Azrael. Memories that have been talked about many times before, but it doesn’t matter. They never get old when you’re with him.\n\nThe pair of you make the moment last as long as you can, until you both know that it’ll be soon time for you to leave again.\n\n“Time for me to go.” You say.\n“I wish these moments were longer.” Azrael replies.\n“I’m sure eventually these moments will be permanent.”\n“The work never ends, I question if that moment will ever come.”\n\nYou touch his skeletal face with your ghostly hand.\n\n“It will Azrael. It will.” You say with a smile before fading away.\n\nYou’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 33": "Going back for Arash would be bordering on foolishness even if you weren’t only considering it to stop from breaking a deal.\n\nStill, you don’t like doing this, but a temporary loss in power is better than allowing the abominations follow you into the portal. The longer they’re pre-occupied with Arash, the better.\n\nHowever the portal certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed.\n\n“THE PORTAL! INVADE THE INFERNAL REALM! LET IT BE THE FIRST STEPPING STONE TO OUR RETURN! WE SHALL REIGN AGAIN!” a deep voice orders from all around you.\n\nYou waste no time and enter the portal and soon the disorientation you’ve been suffering from begins to lift. You’re back in Sinthinia’s room where Zel had her machine open up the portal. Her machine is on, but no sign of her though.\n\nWhat’s more concerning is the portal you just came through isn’t closing and given what’s behind you, you sort of need it to.\n\n“Fuck, where the hell is Zel, probably blowing fucking Spol. The pair of them are going to pay, gotta do everything myself…” you begin muttering as you head over to Zel’s machine hoping it can close the damn portal.\n\nJust as you get to the machine, a figure comes through the portal. It’s Sinthinia, and surprisingly she’s more or less looking like her original form, though she’s got extra mouths and eyes all over her.\n\n“Ah, home sweet home. Time to take it back, time to take it ALL back! My new allies will be here soon.” Sinthinia hisses.\n\nYou curse and uselessly press some button and pull some levers in the hopes of shutting down the portal before Sinthinia is upon you. You call for help as you lop off one of Sin’s weaponized arms.\n\nAs you’re battling Sin, more abominations come through the portal, though some of your own troops finally get their asses in the room to help. Still no sign of Zel though.\n\nAnd that’s when you feel it.\n\nThe cost of your deliberate breaking of your deal. Arash must’ve have finally been killed on the other side because you feel a drain on your power causing you to falter during battle and fall to floor.\n\nSinthinia wastes no time in take advantage and manages to bite through several areas of your armor with all her new mouths. She even manages to penetrate your flesh.\n\n“Mmm, there’s that creamy filling.”\n\nYou summon up all your rage and grab Sinthinia, slamming her against the machine and casting a blast of dark lightning into her face (or her main one anyway). An unnatural scream emanates from her multiple mouths, but you don’t let up. Even in your weakened state, you unleash a continuous stream of lightning, which is now starting to damage Zel’s machine and at least starting to have an effect on the portal.\n\nIt’s also having an effect on you. You felt drained just a few moments ago, but now you feel like you’re about to go unconscious.\n\nSinthinia’s charred body slumps to the floor and you stagger back just in time to see Zel and Spol run into the room, meanwhile the portal is shrinking though there are still smaller abominations jumping in. You also see some mass with Engan’s face, but it’s still on the other side and he’s reluctant to try to squeeze his bulk through the now shrinking portal.\n\nAs Zel’s machine starts to spark and make ominous sounds, Sinthinia crawls away from you and shake your head in disbelief that this bitch is still alive.\n\nYou stumble towards Sin and just as you think you’re about to land the killing blow, you collapse to the floor again.\n\nYour eyes flutter and you see Spol going in to finish off Sinthinia, meanwhile you feel Zel trying to lift you up.\n\n“General! Are you alright?! Spol! Help me with her, I have to make sure this machine doesn’t explode and kill all of us!”\n\nSpol decapitates Sinithinia and orders everyone out of the room as he runs over to lift you up while Zel starts fiddling with her machine.\n\nYou see the portal finally close completely and your troops are busily mopping up the remaining ones.\n\n“General, you need to get out of here just in case Zel isn’t skilled enough to shut down her machine.” Captain Spol says.\n“Yeah…” you answer a bit in a haze.\n\nCaptain Spol helps you out of the room and you partially lean on him the whole time. You turn down one of the corridors and Captain Spols asks “General, you feeling good enough to walk on your own?”\n“Yeah…yeah I think so. Shit…”\n\nYou let go of Captain Spol and lean against the wall for a brief moment trying to gather your wits about the situation. Everything has happened so fast that you haven’t had time to think.\n\nAnd you don’t get much more time to assess the situation either because you suddenly feel a sharp pain go through your side. You look down and see a sword shoved into you nearly to the hilt.\n\nThe treacherous Captain Spol sensed this would be the perfect opportunity to take advantage of your weakness and drives a smaller yet no less lethal dagger into your chest with as much strength as he can.\n\nYou fall to the floor for the last time disbelieving that after everything you survived, your end came at the hands of a third rate infernal officer.\n",
  "page 34": "The whole point of you coming here in the first place was to kill Sinthinia though that goal severely changed the longer you stayed here.\n\nFrom what you can tell, Sin isn’t even the same anymore, if she even exists as you knew her. For all you know you killed her back in the Cells and these ancient creatures just took her form to fuck with you a few moments ago.\n\nWho even knows in a place like this? In any case Sinthinia’s punishment been more than paid. She’s never going to challenge your power in the infernal realms ever again and at best if she’s still alive; she’s going to live out the rest of her existence as a slave abomination to these ancient creatures.\n\nOn the surface, it’s probably to foolish to help Arash, but then so was probably coming here in the first place. That doesn’t mean you can’t still learn something and gain from it though.\n\nYou fly as fast as you can to toward Arash, you cleave several the things attacking him. These ones just seem to dissipate when struck. You grab his arm and pick him up. He’s a little battered, but in otherwise okay condition.\n\n“Shit!” Arash shouts and you both see the Engan mass now looming above you ready to bring down a massive fist (tentacle? claw?) to smash you flat. Arash is fumbling with his gun, but the time of fighting is over.\n\n“Just grab a hold of me as tight as you can, mortal.” You order.\n\nArash thankfully obeys and you manage to fly the pair of you out of the way before a giant fleshy appendage comes crashing down on you both.\n\n“THE PORTAL! INVADE THE INFERNAL REALM! LET IT BE THE FIRST STEPPING STONE TO OUR RETURN! WE SHALL REIGN AGAIN!” a deep voice orders from all around you.\n\nDespite encroaching abominations and their attempts at mind fuckery, you focus on the portal and continue your fast approach towards it. Arash, continues to hang on to you.\n\nSoon you enter the portal and the disorientation you’ve been feeling starts to lift. You’re back in Sinthinia’s room where Zel had her machine open up the portal. Her machine is on, but no sign of her though.\n\nJust as you’re about to drop Arash, you feel a force crash into your back and you fall to the floor with Arash right under you.\n\nYou instinctively roll out of immediate danger (And over Arash) and start to stand up to face whatever crashed into you. It’s Sinthinia, and surprisingly she’s more or less looking like her original form, though she’s got extra mouths and eyes all over her.\n\n“Ah, home sweet home. Time to take it back, time to take it ALL back! My new allies will be here soon.” Sinthinia hisses.\n\n“Shit! Arash, get the fuck up and get to that machine to close that portal!” you shout and head towards Sinthinia who wastes no time in reforming her arm into some fleshy weapon.\n“Machine? Wha? How the fuck should I know…” Arash starts to say but then realizes it doesn’t matter if he knows how to operate it or not and quickly goes over to it.\n\n“It’s over Cista! You’re not winning this one and you will soon learn what it feels like to be one with the ancients and serve them FOREVER.”\n“While I know you’re glad to suck the cocks of whoever has power, that’s not me. That’s NEVER me.”\n\nYou chop off Sin’s weaponized limb and then freeze her; you then chop down several abominations coming through the portal.\n\n“Where the fuck is Zel? Where the fuck are my troops? Surely they haven’t all left the damn castle. HEY GET YOUR ASSES IN HERE, WE GOT SHIT TO KILL!” you shout.\n\nArash still fumbling with the machine still hasn’t figured out how to turn it off. In fact, it looks like the portal is getting bigger.\n\n“This isn’t working!” Arash shouts.\n“Then help me deal with these eldritch slave fucks then!” you order.\n\nSoon some of your troops hear the noise and begin helping you. Arash uses his odd weapons against the horde entering through the portal.\n\nAnd then something bigger attempts to squeeze through. A bloated fleshy mass with writhing tentacles and covered in deformed faces appears, though one face still remains dominant.\n\n“The Infernal Realm. It’s every bit as repulsive as I’d heard as a celestial. Things will be so much better once the true masters reshape it!” Engan remarks.\n\nYou direct your attention to Engan and order everyone else to do the same. Engan smashes two of your men with a thick tentacle and skewers another one with his spikey bits. You melt part of him, but more is just oozing through the portal.\n\n“Oh shit! What the fuck is that?!” you hear Zel shout, who comes running in with Captain Spol. Amazing.\n\n“Zeljenir get your slutty ass over to that fucking machine and turn it off! Spol, fucking help with this overgrown pus squid!”\n\nNo sooner have you given your commands, when you’re swept off your feet and then nabbed by another tentacle. It slams you against the wall a couple times causing you to drop your weapon. Now dazed, you are pulled closer to the portal.\n\nHanging upside down, you find yourself staring right into the deformed face of Engan.\n\n“You’re going to a dark wet place and I’m going to enjoy putting you there.” Engan says with a wide grin and his mouth opens up in a manner to make good on his threat.\n\nFortunately, his threat is cut short when Zel finally cuts the machine off causing the portal to shrink. This is enough distraction to cause Engan to bellow a predictable sound of disbelief giving you time to conjure a flaming weapon in your hand and cut yourself free from his grasp.\n\nYou notice that the mass of flesh is starting to disintegrate now rather than reforming or whatever other nasty oozy shit it does when you’ve chopped it off before. Arash’s odd weapon that shoots purple waves of some sort is also making short work of what remains of Engan.\n\n“Back into the portal! Back! Back…” a voice cries out as you notice the mass trying to squeeze back from where it came.\n\nYou press your advantage with your flaming sword in one hand and casting an acid blast with the other. Arash keeps a safe distance and backs you up. Even Captain Spol proves useful finally.\n\nSoon the portal closes up completely and what remains is a quivering bit of fleshy yellow goo on the floor desperately trying to find a place to slither off to, but now cut off from it’s home energies, it obviously isn’t long for this existence anyway.\n\nYou step over to it and it forms into the vague face of Engan again. It displays an expression of anger.\n\n“You think you have won here infernal bitch? You’ve only delayed the inevitable. The old ones are returning and they…”\n\nYou shut up Engan’s last pontificating monologue with a blast of hellfire. You watch the fleshy mass squirm and screech as whatever life still remained of it disappears into nothing.\n\n“General, what are we doing with this one?” Captain Spol says causing you to look over and see him standing over what looks to be the emaciated and mutilated husk of Sinthinia. She’s somehow still alive. You aren’t sure how, but you’re guessing maybe she still had enough infernal left in her to exist as this pathetic remnant that lies before you.\n\nYou walk over to Sinthinia who is making pitiful mewling sounds and incoherent babbling about something. Green drool is coming out of her mouth and other orifices. She doesn’t even turn to face you, she just lies there shaking in a puddle of disgusting goo.\n\n“You going to keep her for questioning?” Spol asks.\n“No. This one is a complete fucking vegetable. I don’t even want to dirty up this realm with its existence any longer.”\n“You want me to dispose of it?”\n“No. I got this, captain.”\n\nYou burn Sinthinia much in the same way as you burned Engan’s face. Sin does nothing but give a minor whimper as she is obliterated. You don’t even get any satisfaction out of doing it. If anything you gave her a mercy. Last thing you ever wanted, but shit happens in this fucked up universe. You’re guessing this is just one more of those cosmic jokes. Just like your very existence in some ways. You’re planning on getting the last laugh though.\n\nYou now turn your attention to Spol who is fidgeting with his sword.\n\n“And Captain?”\n“Yes General?”\n“I told you not to fuck Zel.”\n\nWith one swing you lop off Spol’s head with ease. His body drops uselessly to floor causing Zel to give a wide-eyed look, but saying nothing.\n\n“Oh don’t worry Zel, you’re actually useful, so you’ll just be getting a less severe punishment later for failing to keep it out of your mouth. Nothing permanently damaging though. But REALLY Zel? Spol? After you bitched to me about him?” you say.\n“He apologized to me and was trying to make amends and well…”\n\nYou shake your head. You realize this is going to be a long process with Zel and a lot of patience is going to be needed.\n\n“I certainly hope my help is more appreciated.” Arash says standing back, holding on to his weapon.\n“Oh most definitely mortal. No need to concern yourself with such things. Your helpfulness has not been forgotten by and as I said, my word is bond. Zel.” You say.\n“Yes general?” Zel responds.\n“Start making yourself useful right now by taking Arash here to his home world, whatever that one is. I’m sure he can fill you in on the details.”\n“I can’t use this machine, it’s been damaged General.”\n“Well just take him to one of you other ones I know you have. Arash just follow Zeljenir here and she’ll lead you where you want to go. Remember to keep your eyes on her, you wouldn’t want to not pay attention and get separated. This might not be where you were trapped before, but the infernal realm is still no place to wander if you’re not prepared.”\n“Heh, I don’t think that will be a problem. I really can’t wait to get home after who knows how long. Not to mention your assistant here is very easy on the eyes. ”\n\nArash directs his attention to Zel, looking her up and down. You call Zel over before she leaves.\n\n“Make sure he gets home. He was truthful with me, and I gave my word.” You say.\n“I understand general.” Zel answers.\n\nZel starts to leave and tells Arash to follow her. He barely acknowledges your nod goodbye. Understandable, it’s probably been awhile since he’s seen a woman like Zel.\n\nYou remain in the room a moment longer just dwelling on everything that occurred. You didn’t imagine having to deal with the shit you had to deal with, but in some ways maybe it’s good that you did. You now have a little knowledge of what is to come. Namely horrors that plan on destroying all of reality as you know it.\n\nYou’ll be ready though.\n\nYou have to be.\n",
  "page 36": "Order. Lovely Order.\n\n\nYou sit at a table by yourself drinking your blood of the damned surveying the big party currently going on due to the recent victory.\nYou don’t usually indulge in associating with these victory celebrations like your soldiers do since you’re often busy preparing for the next conflict, but even without your own side trip to bring down Sinthinia permanently, this was a major victory and there is a lot of merriment. You figure you might as well appear to not be totally distant from the lower infernals.\n\nSmall things like that can make a difference after all in loyalty and respect. Apparently Sinthinia had been a snobby queen bitch to everyone for centuries and most were happy to see her go. Nothing worse than a stuck up whore.\n\nOf course you’re sure that if you ever die, most of these hateful lot (or others like them) will celebrate your death as well. Still, what can you do except not give them the satisfaction by NOT dying.\n\nEveryone is staying away from you despite you being here, which means they either fear or respect you enough to not disturb you. Always a good sign that you’re doing something right.\n\nBut there’s one you’ve been expecting to see a lot sooner than now. In fact she looks around as if she’s made a mistake coming here, but you’ve already seen her and she’s seen you.\n\nYou beckon her over with a finger and she hesitantly walks over.\n\nZeljenir approaches your table.\n\n“Well?” you ask after taking a drink.\n“Well…there was a problem…” Zel says.\n“Oh? What kind of problem? Was Arash not able to get home?”\n“No, he’s home…but um…”\n\nYou stare at Zel, and you can almost taste the fear coming from her. Makes you wonder how in the hell she made this far as an infernal. Sometimes she comes off very mortal.\n\nYou pour Zel a drink and push it over to her and motion her to sit down.\n\n“Zel, calm yourself. I told you, your skills are very useful to me and if I wanted to kill you that would hardly give me the same pleasure of just seeing you cower before me every time you fuck up in some small way.”\n\nZel sits down and downs her drink, closes her eyes and takes a deep breath before speaking.\n\n“It wasn’t my fault.” Zel says.\n“Of course it wasn’t. Now what did you do?”\n“Well, Arash followed me back to my main workshop like you told us both to. Everything was fine, but I guess Arash was a little too entranced by…um me. I turned around to tell him I’d need just a few moments to send him back to his world and he got very close to me. Too close. And he began to hold my hand expressing how beautiful I was and how I exceeded the beauty of even the celestial women he’d seen in his travels.”\n\nYou nod and take a drink.\n\n“Mm, go on.”\n“Well I tried to pull away at first, but then he said he didn’t want to go home! Mentioned that he wanted the pair of us to run away and travel the planes together.”\n“And?”\n“And then he kissed me…and well that was it. I went into succubus mode and he didn’t survive the encounter.”\n“I see. Did you swallow his soul after swallowing his load?”\n“Oh no! I panicked after realizing I’d killed him. I couldn’t think of anything else to do except send his body back to his home world. I swear I didn’t mean to disobey orders!”\n\nYou smile a bit.\n\n“You didn’t disobey orders. You sent him home, which is the exact deal I made with him. As I said, calm down.” You say.\n“You’re not mad?” Zel asks.\n“No, why would I be? I figured something like that would happen. It’s why I sent him with you alone. Most mortals, humans especially can’t resist a succubus. I mean he even made the first move. He touched YOU first. He kissed YOU first correct?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well that right there was a breach in the deal on his part. I didn’t harm him, not even indirectly. It was his fool ideal to go around kissing strange demon girls. Still, I am happy to hear you didn’t take his soul and sent his body home. He was a helpful mortal that probably played a role in saving my life. He probably deserved a happy ending, which you apparently gave him in more ways than one.”\n“Yeah, I guess so, but I don’t understand something.”\n“Oh?”\n“If you found this mortal helpful, why did you set up events to lead to his own downfall?”\n“Zel, you do realize we’re infernals right?”\n“Yes, but you’ve always seemed a bit different. Like sure you’re ruthless and mean, but you’ve never seemed unnecessarily cruel.”\n“I don’t consider what I did as cruel. What I did was very necessary though. You can’t make a deal with hell without a price. Arash made a deal with me and paid the price. And to be fair, he STILL had the opportunity to make it AND survive unscathed. Not my fault he was weak like most mortals.”\n\nZel nods her head at your explanation, but you don’t stop there.\n\nYou explain that the point isn’t just this one exploitation of a loophole in a contract. You are trying to achieve a greater goal. You want to unite the infernal realm. Ever since you discovered your true nature that has always been your goal. The infernal realm is a lawless place to be sure, but there CAN be order.\n\nWonderful, terrible order. Order that would make the infernal realm truly something for the heavens to fear.\n\nYou go on tell Zel that with the recent experience, your goals are even clearer. You realize that there are even worse places in the universe. This is just a sample of these eldritch beings’ power and if Engan’s threats are to be taken seriously, then they are going to be a major problem in the future.\n\nAll the more reason to stick to your principles and promises, even if it is inconvenient and risky at times. Order and discipline MUST be adhered to if there is to be any hope of preparing for the great war to come.\n\n“And I can’t do it by myself unfortunately, I’ll need the worthy to help me play a major part in this plan.” You say.\n“And you feel I’m worthy?” Zel asks a bit shocked.\n“No. But you have potential. One of the few I see it in. Not sure why though. You are fairly unremarkable compared to other infernals of your skill and intelligence.”\n\nZel looks as if she’s about to say something, but stops herself. Too late now though and you motion her to speak.\n\n“Zel, once again just say it.”\n“Um, I was going to suggest, maybe you like me?” Zel remarks.\n“Well I haven’t killed you or even hurt you too badly for your failings in the past so I guess that’s one way of looking at it.”\n“No, I mean you like me…”\n\nZel goes to touch your hand and you instantly pull it away and lurch forward enough that causes Zel to fall back and nearly tip her chair over.\n\n“Have you lost your mind?” you growl.\n“Apologies! I meant no disrespect! I just thought…I mean…” Zel sputters.\n“You thought what? And choose your next words with care lest you make me rethink my favoritism.”\n“I mean…there’s just stupid rumors and I thought maybe you liked me in that way like some have said which is why you’re so protective.”\n\nYou sit back and nearly snort a chuckle. Figures that even with all the respect and fear you command, you still can’t stop rumors.\n\n“First of all, I eventually want a list of every infernal that has been most active in spreading these rumors. Second, as much as having a dominant mommy that you could curl up to and suckle upon a breast for security would be everything you hoped for, no. Just no. I’m not interested in you in such a disgusting way. I’m not into anyone or anything other than my goal. THAT is my passion. My protectiveness of you is merely pragmatism as I have stated quite clearly before. Understand?”\n\n“Clearly. And I apologize once again.” Zel remarks.\n“Don’t be sorry, be efficient. You need to be better than you are. I can’t stress this enough.” You reply.\n“I understand. I just hope to achieve half the amount of discipline as you have. It’s always been difficult for me. Even in my old life before I learned of my infernal heritage, I was quite the party girl in college.”\n“Hm, I’ll bet.”\n“Sort of surprised I didn’t acquire a nickname like Mattress Madeline or something.”\n“Wait, your mortal name was Madeline?”\n“Yes, why?”\n“Nothing. Just didn’t know that.”\n“When my mom showed up at my graduation, that was surprising enough considering I was told she was dead. But then for her to explain what I really was, which was then in turn backed up by my father, I couldn’t believe it. I suppose it explained so much though. Why I was so sexually active and attracted to danger by hanging out with my city’s gang members. Also had odd control over goblins for some reason.”\n\nAfter this brief unburdening tale of her mortal past, Zel looks at you expectantly. Whatever it is though better not involve trying to touch your hand (or anything else) again.\n\n“How did you do it so easily?” Zel asks.\n“Do what exactly?”\n“Achieve the status you have now?\n“It wasn’t easy, I assure you.”\n\nYou think about your next words to Zel. You know that just telling her to be like you isn’t going to help. You need to come up with something else since she’s obviously trying her hardest to “bond” with you and seek guidance even if she’s fumbling about it.\n\n“Zel, if you’re asking me how to tame the filthy urges you obviously have like most of your kind, I don’t have any secret advice. The truth is, I never really had the same problem despite my mother also being a succubus whore. Even during my time as a half mortal, I wasn’t exactly active and trust me I had multiple chances at opportunity.”\n“Oh.”\n“All I can tell you is after I stopped floundering about as a half mortal for far too long denying my nature, I stayed focused and driven on my goals. Regardless of who spawned me, I wasn’t going to follow in the wanton footsteps as an agent of sexual assault. I was going to be MORE than that. And I am. You can too. I see the potential in you enough that I’ve been willing to entertain your questions and misguided attempt to have a deeper bond with me today. So there you go, there’s your inspiration. Make it count and prove me right, because I hate being wrong.”\n\nZeljenir nods a few times and gets up. She then mentions that she’s going to study Arash’s weapons that were doing so much damage to Engan and the ancient ones. She hopes that maybe she can reproduce them. You certainly approve.\n\nBefore she walks away, she attempts to ask one more question. You already know what it’s going to be.\n\n“General…”\n“Nope, not telling you what my mortal name was. That’s the past and I only focus on the future. I suggest you do likewise.”\n\nZeljenir bows and leaves. Impressively she even ignores the lot in the party festivities that are making crude suggestions to her. Of course she knows you’re probably watching. You guess time will tell if your “faith” in her potential is misplaced.\n\nYou sit for a moment longer, knowing that you’ll need to get going soon as well. Your destiny isn’t going to master itself. Despite what you told Zel about dwelling on the future, you can’t help but think about your own past now.\n\nYou try not to do that for several reasons, but mainly because it makes you think of how much time you wasted in that inferior form with misguided attachments, no matter how few they were.\n\nWhile you told Zel the truth of why you got to where you were, you would certainly never tell her the entire story of why it was so easy to not embrace being a succubus whore even if you wished to indulge in such a vile path.\n\nAnd that’s all because of the lowly mortal who managed to win your heart. Aron still has it, as he still lives for now. However, you fully believe that even when he finally expires like all mortals, he’s probably going to still have it. You’ll never be completely free of him even in death.\n\nYou miss the persistent bastard.\n\nYou stop your reminiscing before you show weakness and someone sees. You take one last drink and get up.\n\n“Damn it Tanya, pull it together.” You mumble to yourself.\n\nAnd so you do. You always do.\n",
  "page 39": "Something more is going on with the dero and while maybe Kessla doesn’t know shit, you can find out more since contrary to popular belief, you’re very charismatic and reasonable.\n\nWhile you’d rather not go in alone, you know you’ll have to go in with minimal force. You show up with a bunch of warriors and the dero aren’t even going to talk, they’re going to just attack. Still, there’s no reason to be foolish and go in completely alone.\n\n“Thank you Kessla, you’ve been very cooperative.” You say.\n“Great, you going to kill me now and put an end to my misery or are you going to go back on your word and torture the shit out of me?” Kessla remarks.\n“Neither actually. Seems that I still need you, since you have the password to the dero door.”\n“Wait, you want to go there? What, are you going to attack them?”\n“If I have to, but considering you were able to make a deal with them, I assume someone with more skill can make a better one. Now you wait right here, I’ll be right back.”\n\nYou leave Kessla tied up and go seek out some of your people. You gather a couple of warriors of the female persuasion since this is obviously a job for the superior sex. You then come back to release Kessla, she’s still a little wobbly, but you motion your two warriors to help her. She occasionally winces in pain with one of her hands clutching at her ass.\n\n“There you go. Now I don’t think it needs to be said that you shouldn’t attempt to escape or attack, otherwise that would be very bad. Much worse than Drunni’s aggressive romance strategy I assure you. But I trust you’ll continue to cooperate in order to get this over with correct?” You ask Kessla.\n“Yes.” Kessla responds.\n“Yes what?” you say with a slap to Kessla’s face.\n“Yes…Mistress.”\n“Good, let’s go.”\n“Wait!”\n“What?”\n“Well I mean can’t I put my clothing back on so I have some sort of dignity?”\n“We don’t have time for all that, and right now you should just be happy I’m not making you ride a horse or something similar. Now lead the way to the dero door.”\n\nKessla leads the way to the dero door where upon she whispers the password and it opens. You make a mental note of what she said and the four of you descend further underground.\n\nKessla mentions that when you reach the bottom, it’s only a short distance to the left to a clearing where she would leave “payment.” Going further left leads to an outpost which is heavily fortified with a gate. She mentions never having gone farther, but she assumed there’s a dero village or something similar past that.\n\nKessla mentions once again that last time she was down here, nobody met with her to retrieve the girls. Not even when she knocked on the outpost gate.\n\nEventually you reach the clearing and immediately you can sense that you’re being watched. Maybe they didn’t bother to meet Kessla, but they’re bothering to meet you.\n\n“I know you rock eaters are here. Are you going to come out or are you lot going to just stare at perfection while you beat your stubby dicks?” you say.\n\nNot long after your words, a dero comes out from the darkness. Surprisingly he isn’t armored at all. A very muscular pale bearded male stands before you and he doesn’t look too crazed or unkept, if you had to guess, he’s probably on the younger side, perhaps between hundred and two hundred years old. Still, he has less squat looking facial features than the handful of dero you’ve seen in your lifetime.\n\n“Well, I suppose this day was going to happen. I heard too many stories about you for me to not believe you wouldn’t eventually come here personally. Though a little surprised you didn’t come in with an invasion force. Which means I’m guessing you’re here in a diplomatic capacity.” The dero says to you.\n“Hm, you’re remarkably polite for a dero.” You remark.\n“Is there any reason why I shouldn’t be? Doesn’t seem like being antagonistic is going to serve much purpose considering you didn’t seem to come here with hostile intent.”\n“You are correct that I didn’t, but past experiences with dero have usually involved verbal insults at best. I expected much the same during this encounter.”\n“Well glad that I was able to surprise you. I imagine that’s rare for a woman of your experience.”\n“Experience. Well I guess there’s the indirect insult about my age. A bit tame really.”\n“I didn’t actually mean to imply anything negative about how old you are. Apologies if it came off that way. It was more of a compliment about how worldly a beautiful woman such as yourself is.”\n“More compliments. At this point I’m having a hard time believing you’re a dero.”\n“Yes, I’m aware my people are known to be a relatively humorless grim race when they aren’t going completely insane, but tell me when was the last time you actually spoke with one of us?”\n“Decades ago when I used to be an advisor for the Empire. There was an obnoxious group of the mad little bastards that did work for the old emperor. Our interactions weren’t many, but they were always filled with mutual loathing.”\n“I see, well I hope our interactions will be filled with less loathing. Now then, I see Kessla there with you in a state of undress. I can guess that she is no longer in charge of anything so let’s get down to hammering out a new mutually beneficial deal which is what you’re presumably here for. We can go inside the gatehouse where you can be more comfortable though rather than standing here.”\n“While that’s very accommodating of you to be concerned with my comfort, I assure you that I’m more comfortable talking to you here where you mistakenly believe you already have an advantage over me with your stunted fellows hiding in the shadows, as opposed to deeper in your little community where you definitely will.”\n\nThe dero surprisingly chuckles. You don’t think you’ve ever heard a dero laugh before unless it was part of some sort of insanity.\n\n“If it puts your mind more at ease, trust me, the moment you came here, you were already in a position of advantage. Something I will be getting to in a moment. However, have it your way…Mistress isn’t it?” the dero says.\n“Yes, though I still don’t know your name. I can continue to address you as dero or rock eater if you like, it makes no difference to me.” You respond.\n“Marzost will do just fine.”\n“Okay Marzost, how about you start off by telling me what you’re doing here exactly and why you even approached Kessla to help in her treason.”\n“Well, if it had been up to me, I would have approached you first. But at the time, it wasn’t up to me, in fact this is actually the first time I’ve met Kessla. Sure I know about her, but the deal she made was with another dero a few years ago. I’m sure if you asked her, she’d tell you she’s never seen me before assuming she didn’t think we all looked alike. The one she dealt with was Mirskoy.”\n“So where is he?”\n“Oh he’s a drooling idiot now. Or rather was a drooling idiot. We killed him last year when he went mad to the point of smearing his shit all over himself and babbling nonsense. There was a bit of a power struggle over who should take charge, but that eventually got all sorted out. Still, there was debate over how to proceed next because it was obvious even by that point that our current deal with Kessla wasn’t going to be sustainable. Either she was going to be successful in her goals and then most likely end our deal or the result which I felt was more likely, which is you would win and…well here we are.”\n“Kessla says she’s been trading svelk females to you in exchange for building her little anti-magical headquarters. Also says you’ve actually been successfully breeding with them. To my knowledge, our races cannot interbreed. If they could, I would have guessed we would have been going to war a lot more often in the past.”\n“That is all true, but I’m living proof we can.”\n“Wait, you’re saying your mother was a svelk?”\n“Yes. In fact I was the first natural birth through svelk-dero intimacy. Unfortunately I also seem to be the only natural birth through svelk-dero intimacy. Fortunately recent advances in medical science has helped get around that problem.”\n“Fascinating. Tell me though, are your men ready to move quickly?”\n“Um, well they’re going to move as quick as the armor allows them to. Wait, I hope you aren’t implying something hostile given the relatively pleasant conversation we’ve been having.”\n“Always. Don’t worry though, I’ll make this quick.”\n\nMarzost suddenly draws his pistol and calls for his people to move in, but you’ve already attacked your two warriors holding Kessla and knocked them out before they could adequately defend themselves. Kessla tries to escape, but you manage to zap her with a lightning bolt. Not enough to kill her, but definitely enough to stun the shit out of her. She falls to the ground and twitches a bit, but isn’t getting up anytime soon.\n\nYou turn back around to Marzost who still has his weapon pointed at you. Several armored dero have also come out of the shadows and pointing their rifles at you as well.\n\n“While I know you lot would love to shoot your hot loads at me and have a big dero gangbang, as you can see I’ve provided a gift of three as a token of goodwill. So you can put that thing away and tell your men to gather up the gifts.”\n“Seems you’re full of surprises as well. Okay then.”\n\nMarzost motions for his people to gather up your “gifts” and puts away his pistol. He actually gives you a brief smile before he shouts for someone to open up the gates. Armored dero pick up Kessla and the other two and carry them towards the outpost.\n\n“Well, we going in too? If we’re going to spend time hammering out details of our new deal, might as well get comfortable.” You ask Marzost.\n“You were concerned about going in before, you do realize you have even less back up now right?” Marzost replies.\n“Given that I just managed to cast lightning even with all your magic nullifying rocks around maybe it’s YOU that should be concerned.”\n“Hm, I might be very concerned if I didn’t think that didn’t take a lot of energy on your part. I can guess you did that on purpose to show that you could if you really needed to, but I doubt very seriously you could keep that up for long here. Still impressive though. Yes, you are a very remarkable woman of power. You certainly live up to your reputation. Well, let’s go then.”\n\nMarzost leads the way and you smirk as you have him now completely entranced with you. Granted he seemed that way before, but then again all right thinking beings find you irresistible.\n\nHe is an unusual dero though. You’re guessing that has something to do with him being birthed by a svelk. There is something a little unsettling about that and not much bothers you anymore.\n\nYou and Marzost sit down in one of the rooms in the outpost and have a private conversation about what each of you wants. Marzost immediately assumes you want an anti-magical structure made like they did for Kessla, but you’re not really interested in that. Mainly because you want to be able to actually USE your magic to combat against the undead. You instead insist that you want the dero to provide soldiers to help with the defense of Dokkrus.\n\n“Hm. I wasn’t quite expecting such a request. That’s a pretty major one.” Marzost remarks.\n“Well in case you haven’t noticed, it’s a major war on the surface. Everyone is struggling against the dead.”\n“Yes, I’m aware. I’m also aware it’s futile.”\n“I was told that you lot thought a little differently than your fatalistic brethren.”\n“We do, but we’re still realistic. We’re not doing what the other dero are doing and preparing for mass suicide, but struggling against this undead horde isn’t going to work either. Evigrus is lost. In a few more years, the Empire will have fallen and all that’s going to be left are the pathetic remnants running and hiding in the far corners of that continent. As for Nyttrus, the continent is small enough that it’s already been mostly overrun and reports say the Empire withdrew completely from it to shore up Evigrus. This is why we’re here. Dokkrus is currently the least affected by this event.”\n“To do what then? Just build a settlement out of your dero rocks to keep the undead away and keep your race alive by breeding with svelk women?”\n“Pretty much. I mean I know it sounds like a simple plan, but simple plans are often the best to pursue. I feel that you would benefit better by preparing as we are and get used to this situation. Life is going to be hard, but it CAN continue to exist.”\n\nMarzost looks and even sounds sincere in his words. You can’t detect any deception, but once again the lack of regular dealings with dero makes them hard to read, not to mention Marzost isn’t the typical dero anyway.\n\nNone of that matters though because whether he’s sincere or not, the fact is he’s not dealing with the undead as much as you are, and hiding behind rocks hoping they dispel the necromantic magic isn’t going to cut it in your case. You don’t have the luxury of having a small population to defend. Dokkrus is a sizable enough continent that you wouldn’t be able to reconstruct entire towns out of the dero rocks, even if you could get enough anyway.\n\n“Look Marzost, if you want to keep your race from dying out then you’re going to have to fight for it and that means providing troops in this war against the dead. You can’t just hide out here in the comfort of your underground dwelling. So this is what you’re going to do, you’re going to provide a portion of your people to help us if you want continued access to svelk vagina. And since you’ve insisted that we should build shit out of your rocks, you’ll be providing those as well. I suppose such structures might come in handy in some sort of capacity.”\n\nMarzost sits back and exhales a bit. He shakes his head a bit while looking down at the table.\n\n“You really are pushing things here.” Marzost says.\n“Yeah, well no point in beating around the baby. That’s my offer. We’re taking all the risks and the brunt of the attacks, so you can accept the deal or I walk right now and good luck with making your current supply of females last another generation. And don’t think to threaten me by implying I wouldn’t walk out of here, because regardless of if I did or not, the fact is YOU certainly wouldn’t be. I’d make sure of that.” You say.\n“Well then…I guess we have a deal, BUT we want MORE females than Kessla was providing. One female for each dero we provide.”\n“Hah, a single svelk is worth five of you rock eaters, and a female svelk is worth even more. You’ll get ONE svelk female for every ten dero you initially provide and continue to provide. I can throw in three more females every six months depending on how things are going and how much help you’ve actually been. We’ll see.”\n“Hrm. You drive a hard bargain, but as I said, you had the advantage as soon as you showed up. If only we had approached you before, like I suggested…very well we have a deal for now.”\n\nYou nod and get up to leave and Marzost follows to see you out. He goes on that he’ll have his hand picked people ready to go up to the surface in a few days at which time you say you’ll have his payment.\n\nWhen you pass the gates, Marzost holds out his hand to you, at first you think it’s his superficial attempt at solidifying your arrangement. While you don’t particularly want to touch the hand of some rock eater, you go through the diplomatic motions and then Marzost springs a move you weren’t expecting.\n\nHe takes your hand (as expected) and then kisses it, saying of how it was a pleasure to finally meet you after hearing all the stories, also mentioning that you were as beautiful as he imagined.\n\nYou slowly pull your hand away and don’t acknowledge his fawning. You just walk away whispering under your breath.\n\n“That’s one.”\n",
  "page 38": "6 TR\n\nYou attempt to cast a simple cantrip and barely a flicker of flame shoots from your fingertip. Kessla’s little headquarters certainly was well nullified, though Dero rock tends to be great for such things. It’s partially why the Svelk never tried to conquer the insane ugly little bastards.\n\nYou wonder how Kessla managed to get a Dero (let alone several) to even agree to build a place for her out their magic nullifying rocks. Even Casimir couldn’t do that and he directly helped them in their war with the trolls. Then again Casimir was a necromancer and probably wouldn’t have wanted to hamper his magic abilities.\n\nSpeaking of necromancy, this place apparently is also very good for keeping out the dead. There are dead bodies all over this place and not a one has even twitched, something that’s unfortunately all too common nowadays. Getting to the point where the dead just have to be burned to ensure permanent eradication. Really makes killing those who displease you more of a chore than it needs to be at times.\n\n“Mistress the entire place has been searched and there was indeed a hidden door leading to a deeper passage which leads to another door made of solid rock. Can’t open it and haven’t explored it yet, but there could be more rebels hiding somewhere down there.” Drunni remarks as he comes up to you.\n“Brilliant conclusion Drunni. Glad you’re able to come up with some things all by yourself since you obviously weren’t able to handle this without my direct help.”\n\nDrunni surprisingly doesn’t even scowl at your remark and quickly moves on to telling you that Kessla is still alive if you want the pleasure of killing her yourself. Honestly you wouldn’t have bothered wasting your time with any of this, but since you had to be directly involved anyway, you figure you might as well amuse yourself.\n\n“Kessla’s still alive? Were you too overcome with pathetic sentimental feelings for her to actually finish her off, or was it just simple incompetence again? No need to answer Drunni, it was a rhetorical question and I know the answer anyway. Well, where is the traitor?”\n“She’s down the hall and in the last room on the left. Have fun…I know I did.”\n\nDrunni says and walks off with a smirk on his face. You briefly wonder what the hell he’s smiling about considering he’s one of the most unfun bastards you’ve known since…well Francis.\n\nYou wonder how he’s doing in all this.\n\nLast reports you heard is his Empire isn’t doing all that great against this apocalyptic event he’s unleashed. Serves him right for not listening to you. It’s okay though; he’ll have plenty of time to apologize to you when you meet again. You’ll enjoy that.\n\nYou’ll enjoy punishing him and making him crawl for forgiveness. Then when he’s right where you want him, you’ll have some real fun.\n\n“What the hell, Drunni didn’t even leave guards here? Fucking idio… hrm…well wasn’t expecting this…”\n\nYou see Kessla bent over the foot of a bed with both of her arms stretched out forward tied to the bedposts by ropes. She’s stripped completely naked and has wounds on her back. When you walk over to the side of the bed, you look at her face which also show a few signs of physical trauma. She manages to look at you back with her one eye, which isn’t closed shut, but she’s obviously not one hundred percent.\n\nYou sit down on the side of the bed.\n\n“Wow, I guess you two rekindled some old flames. No wonder Drunni was so uncharacteristically happy. Looks like he really wore you out. Also looks like your ass was bleeding back there. Bet he didn’t even have the courtesy to at least spit on his dick and just went in raw.”\n\nKessla doesn’t respond, she just buries her face partially into the bed breathing slightly louder than normal presumably from her ordeal.\n\n“I guess he had a lot of pent up energy, but I’ll be sure to remind him of this incident, the next time he wants to turn up his nose at my activities. Shit, I bet that pervert even called you by name while he railed you didn’t he? I knew he wanted to fuck me, but then who doesn’t right?”\n\nKessla manages to lift her head up a bit to look at you.\n\n“Just kill me and get it over with you fucking bitch. Nothing matters anymore anyway. This world is fucking doomed and we’re all already dead.” Kessla says.\n“You sound like a dero with that sort of fatalistic outlook. Is that how you built this place? You suck some dero cock and let their seed infect your brain? It’s okay, you can tell me. How did you get past the smell? I don’t think even I would be able to get used to that. With humans at least you can mask their odor.” you respond.\n\nKessla doesn’t respond.\n\n“Very well I can see you’re in no mood for girl talk and just want to get this over with. There was a secret door discovered going to a deeper passage. Tell me where this leads exactly and I’ll make your death quick. Don’t tell me and I won’t. Either way isn’t going to bother me. This choice is purely for your benef…”\n“YES, I’ll fucking tell you! I’ll fucking tell you everything if you just shut the fuck up! By the gods this was one of the reasons we broke off from your leadership, you’re fucking annoying and not nearly as clever as you think you are. You’re the damn reason we’re all in this fucking mess!” Kessla shouts.\n\nYou smile.\n\n“Well? I’m waiting.” you ask.\n\nKessla exhales and gathers her strength before speaking.\n\n“First, you probably think some of my people ran down there to hide when you breached this place, well I can tell you that didn’t happen. I’m the only one who knows how to open the door by way of magic password. It leads to a dero community.”\n“Okay. Not too surprising though perhaps mildly concerning that there’s one so close by. Most dero communities are under Evigrus and even then very deep underground. This brings further questions of course, one of which is, are the rock eaters deliberately trying to destabilize us? Is that why they helped you?”\n“Partially, though their primary goals are a bit convoluted and they didn’t just help me for the fun of sewing discord either. I had to come up with ongoing payment.”\n“So you WERE sucking dero cock then.”\n“Well not me, but they did want some of our females to breed with.”\n“Wait, what? I know that dero managed to get around their female sterility problem by raiding females of lesser races like humans, keeping them as breeding stock until they’re worn out from the birthing process, but to my knowledge they can’t breed with us. Just doesn’t work.”\n“Yeah well apparently they managed to get around that problem through science or something. You know those little mad bastards are always tinkering with shit like that. Still, it’s a recent thing and it’s not a high priority since from what I hear the most of the dero are preparing themselves for some sort of collective suicide of allowing death to take them.”\n“Yeah, yeah, I imagine with what’s going on this would fall into their nihilistic outlook and embracing complete oblivion. But if that’s the case why would they bother breeding with anything?”\n“As I said, this is only most of the dero. The community I’ve been dealing with isn’t quite as hung up on embracing death. They’re determined to survive, but they’ll need more numbers hence the need for more breeding stock. And of course they’re still mad bastards as you might expect though. To set up a community here under Dokkrus and approaching me to give them breeding stock is proof of that.”\n“So when did they approach you anyway?”\n“Shortly after your dismal failure in leading the defense of Necros.”\n“Hm, a little insulted they didn’t just approach me directly about this. Not like I would have been against having them as allies during this crisis.”\n“I believe they felt you would have been less reasonable to work with.”\n“Nonsense. I’m very reasonable. Like I fully intend on keeping my promise of giving you a quick death since you’ve cooperated with your information. Though I need a few more answers before we get to that.”\n“Great and here I thought I was getting to the end.”\n“Almost, almost. But tell me, besides intending on fighting off the undead and gaining breeding stock, what is this dero community planning? I mean do they intend on attacking us at some point?”\n“To my knowledge, no. They seem focused on trying to keep the undead out with their magic nullifying rock and just continue to exist with a steady supply of breeders. Honestly, I haven’t even heard from them directly in three years. After last year I stopped even leaving them females. I needed all the direct help I could get to fight undead and YOU anyway, and they weren’t providing shit at that point. For all I know they could have all descended into madness and drooling on themselves.”\n\nKessla says she doesn’t know much more about the dero community other than the one time the one approached her; they’ve never even bothered to come to the surface and only met her in a neutral place past the stone door. (Where she would leave the females for them).\n\nIn any case, it doesn’t sound like you should just ignore this. A group of rock eaters making their home right under your feet in Dokkrus is a security threat. You just aren’t sure if you shouldn’t approach in a diplomatic manner or just go in and wipe out the little bastards.\n",
  "page 31": "As much as you might like to cleave Engan in two, you figure he’ll just teleport again, or worse if you actually touch him directly. Who knows what the hell his true form is given what you’ve seen here.\n\nYou stagger back up and with some effort you flap your wings to get to the door quicker. The surroundings change back to gray again.\n\n“If you really knew me as much as you claimed, you’d know that I’ve long since learned to deal with any petty notions of morality that might linger and even that one I haven’t, well that will sort itself out in time. Your ancient masters aren’t the only ones that are patient.” You say giving Engan a wide berth.\n\nEngan just watches you, he doesn’t look angry, or upset, or anything. Just a blank stare.\n\n“So be it.” You hear him utter which seems to echo in your head, which is then followed by several more voices chattering about everything and nothing. It’s an overload of noise in your mind. Doesn’t matter though, because the end is in sight and you’re soon right before the exit.\n\nYou fly through the exit and you soon find yourself back in the town, though it looks very different now. In fact the town doesn’t look like the traditional town anymore at all. Buildings are missing, some are phasing in and out of existence and a few of them are new because you’re certain a floating black fortress looming in the sky wasn’t there before.\n\nAll around you on the ground are bodies though. Some unrecognizable lumps of flesh, others more intact. Some are still moving about. Apparently while you were inside, a great battle took place out here and nobody won.\n\n“You’re alive and still untainted. You’d be the first from that place. Figures it would be an infernal. You lot always was more resilient.” A voice calls out; you look over and see that it’s one of the celestials that isn’t completely eviscerated. The wounds look pretty severe though, he probably isn’t going to last too much longer.\n\nYou cautiously keep your guard up as he staggers towards you.\n\n“No need for that infernal. I don’t believe I’m in any condition to dispense any sort of celestial justice on you. Indeed, you may be the only thing left in this accursed place that adheres to any sort of laws, twisted though yours may be. Never should have followed Engan,…bah it’s done now. This place is finally showing what it always was. That wrongness that lies under this illusion. I can only hope that there is a peace in oblivion for I know I won’t be experiencing the bliss of paradise…I just…just wish I could have seen it one last time…”\n“I am not here to absolve you of your imagined sins celestial.” You say with annoyance.\n\nThe celestial laughs.\n\n“Perhaps that wasn’t your intention, in fact I don’t even know or care why you came here in the first place, but whether you realize it or not, your actions have done exactly that. Perhaps not absolved us, for nothing could have done that for what we did, but you’ve put an end to our torment. Heh…you might even be considered what the mortals call a hero.”\n\nAt this point the celestial collapses, he continues to keep his eyes affixed to him. You see tears in them.\n\n“You better get out of here quick infernal. Even in my final moments, I can still hear the voices of the others. They’re coming. And I don’t mean just here. I mean they’re coming to destroy everything. The hells, the heavens, everything…warn your sadistic fellows, warn my people if those fools will even listen to you. Warn the ignorant mortals, warn everyone you can infernal, they have to be stopped…”\n\nYou realize that this is no idle warning. Even without the seriousness of this celestial’s tone and words, from what you’ve seen here, there definitely is cause for concern.\n\n“Everything…dimming…funny…with you hovering above me like this…you almost look like an angel…close enough I suppose…” the celestial says and then closes his eyes.\n\nYou then look up and experience a dimming of a different nature. You see the sky starting to turn from gray to black. It’s almost as if a void in the sky is opening up.\n\nWhile that isn’t quite what is happening, it might as well be. Thousands of beings are coming from the black fortress and starting to cover the sky. The sounds of madness follow.\n\nYou fly as fast as you can towards where you came in, the mass of bloody bodies under you and the encroaching black void of madness behind (and above) you.\n\nLegions of voices, vision of unknown creatures, faces and worlds enter mind and you try to ignore all of it. You see the tree where you entered and just when you’re picking up your speed, you feel a great weight slapping you down. You nearly fall flat on your face though you stop that from happening, merely landing on your hands and knees instead.\n\n“Ah yes…exactly in the position you should be in. Let us strip you of that heavy armor!” a hissing voice says and you suddenly feel a force claw at your back, penetrating your armor.\n\nYou naturally react very violently; flailing and twisting your body in such a way that you roll away from immediate danger, or at least so whatever is attacking you doesn’t rip your armor off completely.\n\nBy the time you manage to stand up, you narrowly dodge a spiked appendage. As is typical of this place, a barely humanoid thing “stands” before you, several faces exist within its mass, but of course the most dominant one is Engan.\n\n“You should have taken my offer. You should have just submitted to me. Now you’ve ruined everything and released the pressure valve. Now they’ve awakened fully and NOTHING can stop them. Now embrace us. EMBRACE the torment. EMBRACE THE FUTURE.”\n\nYou can feel the vibration of the voice throughout your body causing you to experience dizziness and a wave of sickness. A large mouth opens up from the mass filled with jagged teeth. More spiked appendages attempt to grab you in an effort to draw you inside.\n\nWhile all this is going on the darkness of the creatures from the fortress is growing ever closer. Things are not looking good and you’re trying to maintain your composure, but this place is really getting to you. You almost feel like just giving up, like this is just a glimpse of things to come. Never before have you had these feelings of utter insignificance.\n\nYou cut away more attacking appendages, though more grab you and begin to draw you in. You can feel your armor being slowly cut through by the sharp saw like teeth. In desperation you attempt to cast a blast of acid at it. Thankfully your magic decided to work and it’s enough to drop you as it caterwauls in agony.\n\nWhatever force that’s preventing you from flying is now preventing you from running. You feel like every step is an effort and everything is trying to kill you. Not that you’re not used to that back home, but at least there you always have a fighting chance. Here, it’s like the very laws of reality are conspiring against you, and they probably are.\n\n“You’re not leaving here. I still have such terrible pleasures to show you that I could not have imagined even in HELL.”\n\nFollowing this familiar voice are several serpentine appendages with Sinthinia’s face on them coming out of the ground wrapping around your legs. Others attempt to wrap around your arms. Another still starts gnawing at your crotch trying to bite through your armor.\n\n“Hmm, can’t wait until I get to the creamy filling.” It says looking up at you, before your slam your fist through its face. You swing your sword cutting down more of Sin’s heads, but more spring up like a hydra.\n\nEngan (Or whatever it is with him part of it) recovers from your last attack and resume its pursuit. Several of the dark creatures are now also close enough that they’ll probably reach you soon.\n\nAnd then suddenly a purple wave washes over you. You feel nothing, but you see it visibly affect Sinthinia’s heads most of which disintegrate immediately save for the ones that retreat back into the ground.\n\nEngan is also hit by the purple wave and while it doesn’t destroy him completely, you see pieces of him disintegrate, reducing his mass.\n\nYou look around and see where the magic wave came from and see Arash standing a few feet away wielding some sort of “gun” though it’s obviously not firing bullets as you have been familiar with in the past.\n\n“Glad to see the no violence rule was finally discarded, I was waiting a long time to use this.” Arash says.\n\nThe tree near where you arrived is just a little further away, and with the invisible force no longer seemingly affecting you, you fly quickly towards it and access your beacon stone which you activate.\n\nThe portal back home is open. You turn around and see Arash retreating by quickly walking backwards, still firing his weapon. As damaging as it is, he has no hope against the legions coming at his position (And yours).\n\nArash finally turns around to just run towards you, but he is immediately jumped on by several of the dark abominations. He’s busily trying to fight them off with some sort of blade, but he’s going to be overwhelmed.\n\nUnless you help.\n\nThough in doing so you’re not only risking your existence, but also an invasion by these abominations, if one of them slips into the portal.\n\nOf course you did make a deal with Arash that you would get him out of this place. Breaking such a pact would be very repugnant to you and potentially causing a loss in power, hence why your kind doesn’t make such binding promises often.\n\nThough of course it wouldn’t be the first time an infernal has outright broken their word.\n",
  "page 30": "You look up at Engan and nod.\n\n“Okay. Okay. I see now.” you say.\n“Good. You’ll realize that this was the only way.” Engan replies.\n\nYou reach for his hand and just as you’re about to grasp it, he grabs your hand first. Your other hand which was planning on reaching for your weapon fails to do so, in fact your whole body becomes almost paralyzed. Engan smiles.\n\n“Your attempt at deception could not be hidden from those that know all. Don’t worry though, your reluctance shall not be held against you. Now prepare for ascension!”\n\nEngan’s hand, indeed his entire form begins to change. You attempt to pull away, but to no avail, Engan’s hand has practically melded into your own or at least into your armored gauntlet. Though you can start to feel the armor being melted away.\n\nIn desperation, you once again attempt to reach for your weapon to chop off your connected limb, but you’re stopped by multiple appendages springing from Engan’s body. It isn’t just Engan either, the other abominations are suddenly surrounding you as well.\n\nYou struggle, you fight, but even attempting to muster up all your remaining strength does nothing as you’re ultimately enveloped into a mass of flesh. Your armor protects the rest of you, about as well as it protected your hand. It lasts just long enough for your mind to be overcome by terror, then insanity as you become just another piece, another tool for these ancient monsters to use in their steps to destroy the universe.\n",
  "page 156": "Given how much of an advantage you have on her, you figure you can humor her a little longer. You’re curious to what she’s actually going say to prove herself.\n\n“Very well, you’ve got a couple more minutes.” You say.\n“Thank you. Now I left you with a Miss Olga soon after I birthed you in an alleyway.” The woman remarks.\n“Wait, I was born in a fucking alley?”\n“Yes…look I know, I was a shitty mother, it’s why I gave you up. I knew you’d be better off without me raising you.”\n\nYou almost shake your head at this, but you just continue look at her.\n\n“Well go on.” You say.\n“Okay, so I left you with a Miss Olga who ran an orphanage. Surely she told you of how despite not being ready to be a mother, I wanted to make sure you went to a good home.” The woman says.\n“Nope. She never mentioned you at all to me. In fact she never mentioned the biological parents to any of the orphans as far as I know. I imagine she figured why bother.”\n\nThe woman just looks at you as if she doesn’t have a response for this. You look at her back, knowing she doesn’t. She’s clearly lying.\n\nHowever, you and her have maintained a lot of direct eye contact. You haven’t really realized it mainly because you don’t interact with vampires like this usually. Not to mention that as a fairly powerful necromancer, you’re a bit more resistant to their gaze than you were in the past.\n\nStill, you’re not totally immune and this particular vampire, (whoever she is) has taken advantage of distracting you long enough to quickly close the gap between you two.\n\nYou suddenly see the woman in front of you, feel two sharp points in your neck, then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nYou can’t imagine you would have been so foolish to let a vampire get so close to you at that stage of your life. Still, you suppose you always were a little curious about who your parents really were even if it ultimately didn’t matter.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 155": "There’s more than a few practical reasons not to kill Azrael besides your personal ones.\n\nYou quickly dismiss your fleeting thought of murder. You’re going to take a wait and see approach and actually trust that he knows what he’s doing sometimes. It’s a risk, but then this whole situation is.\n\nRight now the situation is seemingly under control, so now you’re going to enjoy relaxing in your garden listening to your music and watching the gravewings flutter about.\n\nA few months pass and Azrael receives a letter via bat from the Ghoul King saying that it’s important. Azrael takes his leave and entrusts you to take charge while he’s away. (Not that you don’t even while he is here anyway)\n\nAzrael is gone for a week and then you expect him to be back. But he doesn’t come back. When it starts approaching a second week, you begin to get genuinely concerned. On top of Azrael not having come back yet, the Grand Alliance recently took back the Brot Kingdom from Trelik and it’s very likely they’re going to attack you next.\n\nYou send someone to the Drozz Wasteland to find out what’s happened and boost the defenses at Aftermath telling everyone to be ready for a potential attack.\n\nA few days later and you get word about the Brot Kingdom being attacked by a horde of undead giants. Apparently Brot has been overrun and the Grand Alliance has lost control of it. There was also only one necromancer seen in the chaos and the descriptions fit Azrael.\n\nThat asshole went and attacked Brot without any back up or even telling you! That was very foolish of him to besiege entire fucking kingdom without any extra help even if it was in a very weakened state.\n\nIf he survives, you’re going to definitely have some words with him.\n\nEventually Azrael returns victorious and you head out to meet him.\n\n“What the hell did you think you were doing risking your life like that? You should’ve come back to Aftermath for more soldiers before taking on the Brot Kingdom AND the Grand Alliance all by yourself!” you scold.\n“Why? Were you worried about me?” Azrael smiles smugly.\n\nYou hate to admit such a thing especially with that smirk all over his fce.\n\n“Well… um…no! But, you should’ve told me!”\n“I did tell you. I told you I had everything worked out and look…I did.” Azrael says putting his arm around you.\n\nAnd that’s it. You don’t push him away or slap him. You’re not even resisting anymore.\n\nHis ever-growing necromantic aura combined with what you know his feelings to be for you combined with your own feelings and well…it just doesn’t make sense to keep denying what’s staring you in the face. You’re accepting Azrael as your mate and wherever that may eventually lead.\n\nAnd he better not disappoint you.\n",
  "page 157": "There are too many holes in this woman’s story.\n\nThe major thing though that’s given you pause isn’t her story; it’s what she’s trying to do. You realize that she’s trying to maintain eye contact with you for as long as possible to mesmerize you into dropping your defenses.\n\n“Y’know what? Fuck you and your big tits.” You say rubbing your eyes with one hand and bringing forth your garden to attack the vampire with your other hand.\n\nSeveral vines spring from the ground rooting her to the spot, and then followed by several branches impaling her. She screams and hisses until one hits her heart causing her to disintegrate.\n\nWith the bloodsucker dead, you go over to the ashes pondering the woman’s story again.\n\nWas it possible she was your mother? You doubt it mainly because you can’t imagine a party whore like this woman was claiming to be would have risen so high in the Vampire Clans, if indeed they would have even bothered.\n\nThis woman was also powerful enough to attempt to mesmerize you so she had to be a lot older and thus more powerful vampire than what your mother would have been even if vampirism stopped her aging.\n\nMore likely some sort of magical facial alteration along with some superficial knowledge of your background was used to try to trick you by tugging at your emotions.\n\nWouldn’t have worked even if she had really been your mother. Your biological mother didn’t raise you, that task belonged to a woman long dead and much more respected. And you can imagine that woman would definitely not approve of how your life turned out.\n\nMakes you wonder about who your parents might have been though. Were they wizards? Did they perform necromancy? Are they still alive or dead? Did you indirectly or directly kill them? Did they know about you? Did they think of you at all?\n\nYou suppose none of it matters now.\n\nFeeling somewhat out of the mood of enjoying your music and garden, you return to the citadel fully expecting Azrael to show up soon. You dismiss all the claims the woman made about the Vampire Clan putting an end to him.\n\nHe’s survived worse, and he’ll survive this too.\n\nYou haven’t gotten back to the citadel long when all of sudden Azrael shows up just like you knew he would.\n\nHe’s different though. You sense it immediately. You notice he’s got some severe wounds on his body causing you to make a remark of the obvious.\n\n“Catalina, I’m fucking dead.” Azrael says sharply and enters his study without another word.\n\nAnd that would be what you sensed. No life. Apparently he didn’t survive.\n\nBut he did.\n\nYou reflect on what this possibly might mean. As far as you know other than vampires, the only other forms of higher undead are liches and the process of becoming one is very difficult and complex. Very few necromancers have succeeded in doing it and the last one that did was The Great Lich Lord who lead the Dead War centuries ago.\n\nAzrael couldn’t have performed such a complex spell in the middle of not only destroying Velzix, but presumably the Vampire Clan as well, could he?\n\nYou intend on finding out, so you enter Azrael’s study and find him at his desk with a quill and parchment.\n\n“I need some time alone. I have to write a letter to my mom and sister. They should know about what really happened with my dad, even if the rest of the world won’t.” Azrael says, not looking up.\n“I’ll leave you alone as soon as you clear some things up about what happened to you and the Vampire Clans.” You remark.\n\nAzrael looks up and puts down his quill.\n\n“Well it’s very simple Catalina. I foolishly trusted the wrong person, went head first into battle and got myself fucking killed. Then I came back to life and killed every leech in that hidden lair of theirs.”\n“You killed all the vampires?”\n“Oh I’m sure there probably were a few that weren’t there, but that hardly matters. They’ll all be hunted down and put to death eventually. Everything will.”\n“Are you alright?”\n“Yes, I’m fine, I’m just dead.”\n“I’m not talking about your newly acquired physical status so much as I’m asking about your mental state.”\n“As I said, I’m fine. I’m just tired.”\n“Tired?”\n“Yes, and I’m well aware how strange that may seem given that I’m dead and all now, but nevertheless it’s true. Everything’s strange though now.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know how to explain it, at least not yet. I’m still trying to figure it all out. I don’t even know how I came back to life. I just did. What does this mean? If I’d gotten killed before Lord Rostov snapped my neck, would I have come back anyway or did I just get to a point where it was possible? I performed no ritual that would cause me to ascend to lichdom. Shit, I never even bothered to look into it too deeply. Everything I do when it comes to necromancy just comes so naturally. Was my ascension to this state natural too? Is fate or destiny at work?”\n\nYou’ve not seen Azrael quite like this, even you aren’t sure how to respond.\n\n“Are you in pain?” you ask.\n“No. I don’t feel anything at all. Well, I suppose I shouldn’t say nothing at all, but everything is muted now. There’s something else though, I’m not exactly sure what it is yet, but I imagine without feelings getting in the way of things, I’ll reach it.” Azrael says.\n“I see. So…what of your feelings for me?”\n\nAzrael looks at you and you see concern on his face. Mortal emotions haven’t disappeared completely.\n\n“Those remain Catalina. Those will never leave me. I won’t let them.” Azrael says and he goes to embrace you. You hold him tightly and you can already feel the difference, the cold dead flesh. It feels like you’re in paradise.\n\nYou look up at him and passionately kiss him. He kisses you back, and yes, the desire is still there, but again, it’s different.\n\nThere’s part of you that wonders if his feelings for you will dull in time, but it doesn’t matter. Your feelings won’t. His deathly glory just keeps growing greater and there is no way you’d ever be able to resist it at this point.\n\n“I guess I’m more attractive to you than ever now right?” Azrael says with a grin. You’re glad to see he hasn’t lost his same goofy sense of humor.\n“Mmm, why don’t we pick this up later? I know I distracted you from an important task.” You say.\n“Yes, I suppose I should finish that, but I’ll be with you soon.”\n“I’ll be waiting.”\n“Oh, while I was gone, did anything of importance happen here?” Azrael asks.\n“Not really. There was a very minor vampire assassination attempt, but I took care of it personally since it was just one.” You answer.\n“Hm. Just one huh? Unusual, since they usually sent several in the past, but maybe most of them were at their secret fortress just to ambush me.”\n“Maybe. Well one less for you to worry about hunting down.”\n“True. Okay, I need to write this letter. I don’t even know what the hell to say to my mom and sister. I doubt I’ll get a response. Catalina, you really are lucky that you were an orphan.”\n“Yeah, I suppose so.”\n\nAnd with those words, you take your leave of the study and head to the bedroom.\n",
  "page 159": "Your memories go back to when you first started to really see what your beloved was becoming.\n\nAzrael was a lich to be sure, but it was more than that. He was the Great Lich Lord returned and he was still changing.\n\nYou weren’t surprised when he ceased doing the inconvenient things the living need to do such as eating, drinking or sleeping, but after a few years he also stopped pursuing any major intimacy with you.\n\nNot that he couldn’t or wouldn’t when you initiated it. He merely said that the desire was gone and he was gaining ”clarity” of what needed to be done to this world.\n\nHe began mentioning how he started to realize that any sort of truce with the living, even one of them under your rule wouldn’t suffice.\n\nThat was never more apparent the day he decided to not just destroy the Grand Alliance, but just about every major civilization still organized enough to oppose your Dead Dominion at that point.\n\n“Catalina, I think it’s time we finish this war once and for all.” Azrael says walking into your study.\n“Oh you do, do you? Well, I figured that it was coming eventually. So is there any specific way we’re going about this?” you respond.\n“Yeah, we just make a massive push and don’t stop until every living thing is dead.”\n“Wow. Everything?”\n“Everything. I gave the world of the living the chance for peace and they don’t seem to want it. Well I’m tired of fighting, so if the only way to get some peace is to kill everything so be it!”\n\nThere was that clarity. Whether he meant it or not at that point, he was clearly going to murder the world. Never before had you seen Azrael so motivated by a specific long term goal.\n\nAs for you, there was some conflict. You didn’t really have that desire. You had no real problem with the living as it were. Sure you didn’t really like people, but as long as they didn’t stand in your way, you would be fine to let them exist.\n\n“Well, I mean what happens if some people surrender? I mean you’ll still allow them to live like you usually do right?” you answer.\n“What? What’s with this line of questioning Catalina? You’ve never been one to wince at grand scale carnage.” Azrael says.\n“…I know, but I…”\n“Alright, out with it.”\n“Well I mean after we destroy the Grand Alliance, what then? There will be nothing else to do. I mean do we just reign over a land of the dead until the end of time?”\n“Sounds about right.”\n“I dunno, is that our only option?”\n“For fuck’s sake Cat, what the hell did you become a necromancer for then?”\n“Because much like you I probably didn’t feel like I had much in common with people and I could feel a pull towards the dark art of necromancy.”\n“Well what’s the problem?”\n\nThere really wasn’t a problem per say, more like self-reflection at that point.\n\nMuch like Azrael, before all this happened, you mostly went through life drifting. You never really had any long-term goals to be rich, have a family, become powerful or whatever other typical goals most people have.\n\nSure you had your hobbies and your responsibilities, but those were filler for this thing you call life.\n\nAzrael obviously had a greater purpose, what was yours?\n\n“…there isn’t a problem…it’s just I feel like the end is coming soon and question what I’ve accomplished in my life. I mean other than genocide what have I done?” you say.\n“You’re Queen of the Dead! What more could you want?” Azrael responds.\n“Yeah, queen. Big whoop. I’m basically a glorified concubine for a…”\n“Damn it Catalina I’ve NEVER thought of you as that! You know I cherish you and all of you have to offer. I never could’ve gotten this far without you.”\n\nAzrael says this to you while embracing you and staring into your eyes.\n\nYou nearly smile. He does still love you. It’s a lot harder to see it nowadays, but the flame is still there.\n\nStill, you have concerns.\n\n“…I know…it’s just in some ways I see you starting to change and I don’t mean your general loathing of the living either. I mean you’ve always been powerful, more powerful than me, but it’s different. It’s like you’re becoming something else. I sometimes think your path is going to differ from mine to a degree that we will no longer be able to be together.” You say.\n“Catalina my beautiful queen…no matter what happens I shall never leave you.” Azrael says and kisses you.\nAnd there it is. The taste of death. Reassurance.\n\nAzrael is death personified and you love him.\n\nAnd if his goal is to end all life, then you will assist him in whatever capacity that may entail.\n\nTHIS is your purpose.\n\nSeems silly that you needed it, but you suppose that’s just a weakness of still being tied to life.\n\n“And I shall never leave you…Okay, where are we going to attack?”\n",
  "page 46": "He needs you. He’s always needed you. You have to help him and when you do, you’ll figure out a way to solve this situation together.\n\nYou’ll be together like you should have been.\n\nAnd then you’ll kill him.\n\nYes, that’ll be the plan. That was always the plan. It’s the ONLY plan that matters.\n\nYou put aside the books and prepare yourself for a very long distance teleportation. Never a quick process even before this all happened, but just have to be undisturbed for a day or so to focus.\n\nYou send word to Drunni and Gikil that you’re going to be performing a ritual that could potentially turn the tide of the situation and that you are not to be disturbed. You also give that general order to all in your fortress.\n\nYou then make the preparations in your room. The minutes of concentration soon turn into hours. It’s actually more difficult than you thought it might be not just because you can no longer pinpoint Francis’ location, but also because the landscape of Evigrus looks completely different from the last time you were there. Gone is the green grass and trees. Everything is either dead or dying. It’s even worse than what’s been happening on you own continent and this will be the fate of yours if you don’t stop this soon.\n\nAs predicted though the death magic aura is interfering and it’s definitely stronger than you thought it would be.\n\nEventually after nearly a day, you manage to focus on a spot which you believe is at least close to the Empire’s capital. You’ll have to walk the rest of the way, but you just can’t seem to get closer.\n\nYou begin to teleport from your position and soon you find yourself in a blackened field filled with dead grass. It looks more like you teleported to Mortos.\n\nIt feels like you’re in Mortos as well. The death magic here is very strong. You feel its crushing energy immediately and have to cast a protective spell before you’re overwhelmed. You’re not even sure if it’s going to hold for very long.\n\nWhen you finally recover a bit you look around and see a village nearby with undead milling about. Further in the distance, there’s a large walled city with smoke coming from it. It’s been awhile, you’re pretty sure that’s the capital. You teleported closer than you thought.\n\nDoesn’t take long before the undead notice you and start moving in your direction. Nothing else for it but to fight through to the capital.\n\nYou blast the corpses with ease, but they’re nearly without end. Things get a little trickier when the likes of a wraiths and ghosts start showing up, but you persevere.\n\nNothing is going to keep you from your beloved Francis.\n\nYou get through the ruined village and down a road leading to the capital which is surprisingly clear of any more undead, the closer you get though, the harder it becomes to take steps. Your energy is being sapped and your magic isn’t helping you as much anymore.\n\nYou approach the gates and you see a figure stagger towards you, you think it’s another undead horror until they speak.\n\n“Mistress?” a voice calls out and then raises their arms up before partially collapsing to the ground.\n\nYou walk over to the figure who struggles to get up and is having a hard time breathing. She’s an old svelk given her wizened appearance. You figure this must be one of Belina’s agents.\n\nYou pull her up and she manages to stand, but she’s still not doing so great. The aura of death in the air is taking its toll.\n\n“Miss…Mistress. What are you…doing here? It’s not safe! You need to…leave now!” she wheezes.\n“I’m here on important business. Didn’t realize Belina had agents as old as you in the field. What are you? Like pushing a thousand?”\n“I’m twenty six Mistress.”\n“Well shit.”\n“Yeah…don’t go in there Mistress. We need to leave before it finds us!”\n“What?”\n“The God of Death or whatever it is. It just killed the human emperor and…”\n\nYou interrupt her right there.\n\n“What did you say?”\n“The God of…”\n“No! About Francis! The emperor!”\n“Oh, yeah it killed him, he didn’t even put up any resistance…gotta go…”\n\nThe agent attempts to leave, but you won’t let her and pull her back, she’s too weak to resist.\n\n“What the hell do you mean he’s dead and didn’t put up any resistance?!”\n“Mistress, we have to leave…”\n“I asked you a fucking question!”\n\nThe agent finally loses it.\n\n“I MEAN HE’S FUCKING DEAD! HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND LET THE DEATH GOD TAKE HIM! I SAW IT HAPPEN FROM THE BARREL I WAS HIDING IN AT THE TIME!”\n\nThe agent’s outburst causes her to cough and hack up a bit of blood. She nearly collapses again, but manages to keep it together. Meanwhile you’re in a state of shock.\n\n“No…”\n“Mistress we…” the agent stops trying to reason with you and with your grip loosened on her, she pulls away and staggers as fast as she can from the capital. You ignore her, still trying to come to grips with what she told you.\n\n“Can’t be. It just can’t. He survives everything. He’d survive this and he surely wouldn’t just give up. No, bitch had it wrong, I’ll find him. I know I will.”\n\nYou proceed further into the ruined city and whatever protection you had isn’t working at all anymore. The death aura is all encompassing. You see the walking dead in the streets; apparitions flying about and strangely they aren’t even attacking you, though it might be because you’re already half way there to joining them.\n\nYou begin to feel weak and struggle to maintain your balance by leaning against a nearby wall.\n\n“Death comes…join us…” you hear several voices in your head.\n\nYou briefly look at your hands and find them to be no longer youthful in appearance. You go to feel your face and judging by the wrinkles you’re feeling, your face probably doesn’t look that way either.\n\nFrancis’ palace is still a distance, but you’ll make it. This is obviously all some illusion.\n\nYou press on, trying to ignore the dead whispering in your head. At one point you attempt to tell them to shut up, but you’re too weak to even utter anything other than a death wheeze.\n\nEventually you get within better sight of the palace and that’s when you collapse to the ground. You can’t even get up. You’re dying and no magic of yours is going to save you.\n\n“No…I…okay…it’s okay…I’ll be with him.” you utter as your vision starts to fade.\n\nYou see a blur of what you think is a black cloaked figure floating towards you from the palace courtyard, then everything goes dark.\n\nYour body dies and your mind soon follows though it was already broken before this point anyway.\n\nWhile you may have joined Francis in death. You soon learn you didn’t go to the same place he did.\n\nAnd it’s not pleasant.\n",
  "page 45": "11 TR\n\n“No.” you whisper to yourself.\n\nYour connection to him has been lost. Even with the distance and during all this chaos and death going on, you still had that mental connection with him since your temporary alliance against Mortimer and Zelvix.\n\nNo matter how faint, and it was barely there, it was enough for you to know he was at least still alive. You knew he was still engaging in his futile efforts to fight off his enemies, to fight off death, to fight in general. Indeed that seemed to be all he was ever truly passionate about.\n\nYou loved that about him.\n\nYes, he was a fighter. Always struggling against the odds. He must be still alive and maybe with what’s going on the mental link is being blocked somehow. That’s probably it. There is strong magic in the air nowadays after all. Pity most of it is all necromantic in nature.\n\n“No, he’s still alive. I know him.” You say to yourself.\n\nStill, you haven’t had a report from Belina in awhile. It wouldn’t surprise you if she’d gotten herself killed. You swear you’re surrounded by incompetents. It’s a good thing the svelk have YOU to lead them\n\nAlready you’ve managed to completely unite Dokkrus for the first time since the fall of the Svelk Empire. All the important svelk centers of civilization are still holding off the undead hordes…barely.\n\nYou haven’t even had an assassination attempts on you since you took out Kessla five years ago, though constant undead attacks somewhat deter the desire to change leadership that’s been effective during this threat.\n\nAnd this threat is only getting worse despite your relative success in stemming the tide. Even with the deros’ help, things haven’t been getting better. Their magic nullifying structures aren’t doing the job like they used to. The necromantic magic must be growing in strength because the recently dead rising within places literally surrounded by the dero rock have become a reality.\n\nYou’ve spoken to Marzost on occasion about this and he claims that nothing like that has occurred in his community which could be a lie, though they do have more of it in a concentrated area. Hard to tell without ever having been further than their outpost.\n\nEven if they haven’t been suffering from undead attacks, it’s only going to be a matter of time before they do, and there is no way they’re going to be able to replenish their numbers faster than they lose them. None of the living can.\n\nIn fact, you’ve been reconsidering your deal with him since their help is becoming less useful. You’re still convinced that they’re hiding something, might be time to find out.\n\nYou’ve been pouring over every obscure magic tome you’ve been able to get your hands on and there is nothing that looks like it’s going to reverse what Francis did.\n\n“The fool. I tried to tell him. Why did he not listen? Why did he always struggle? Why did he just not OBEY?!” you say throwing a book aside.\n\nYou hope he’s still alive.\n\nYes, of course he’s alive. He’s Eternal. He survives everything. You trained him to do so. You raised him like a son. He has to be alive to come back to you.\n\nHe has to be alive to love you.\n\nHe has to be alive for you to kill him.\n\nMaybe you should check on him. It’s risky due to no longer having your mental link to even pin point a location and a large expenditure of energy to teleport such a great distance, but you should be able to do it without issues. Maybe you’d be able to reason with him now that he’s seen the obvious damage he’s done.\n\nThen again why should you? This is his mistake, he can solve it himself. He can’t rely on you to be there to hold his hand and help every time there’s a crisis.\n\nWhat you have to do is focus on either stopping what’s going on or at least ensuring the survival of the reunited Svelk civilization. First time this was a major issue it took the combined might and magic of the Svelk Empire and those fools on Mortos to stop it.\n\nUnfortunately, the citizens of Mortos are now truly dead and the Svelk Empire is more of a loose confederation held together out of survival more than anything else. Not to mention your people also had infernal assistance, though that was a double edged sword that resulted in a high cost.\n\nA cost that the svelk and you personally never recovered from.\n\nHowever, that’s the past and the situation back then even as bad as it was, still wasn’t as dire as it is right now.\n\nYou’ve been avoiding seriously reading the tomes dedicated to demon summoning and such, but you might need to make a new deal with infernals again to get you out of this mess since it’s about the only thing that will at least even up the odds in the long run.\n\nWhile you’re pondering all this, your mind still can’t help but go back to thoughts of Francis.\n\nHe might need your help…\n",
  "page 47": "He’s strong, he’s clever, and you taught him. He’ll be fine. You’ll see him again soon.\n\nYou look over at the pile of demonology tomes and know what you’ll probably need to do, but before you step one foot in hell, you’re going to see what the hell the dero are up to.\n\nAnd you’re going in with a force this time. You call for Gikil and Drunni.\n\n“So we’re wiping out the rock eaters?” Gikil asks.\n“Not necessarily, but the possibility exists. I want you to gather the best warriors and because we’re going in heavy.” You say.\n“Never saw the point of being allies with the filthy grubs in the first place.” Drunni remarks.\n“Their help kept YOU off the front lines didn’t it Drunni?”\n\nDrunni scowls but says nothing more. You ask Gikil about dero personnel elsewhere, but he mentions that there’s none of consequence. Battles with the undead have taken their toll and most platoons that remain are tied up at strategic outposts where the undead is the worst. He goes on to say they wouldn’t even know if you wiped out the entire dero settlement before it was too late.\n\n“Did you want to wipe out the dero on the surface?” Gikil asks.\n“No, if it is as you say, we can do that later if need be. As I said, it might not be necessary but what is definitely going to change is our previous agreement. Prepare the invasion force.”\n\nTakes only a couple days for Gikil to assemble a suitable and sizable force. It is fortunate that you still have enough people to redirect from the undead problem.\n\nAs for you, you spent most of those two days meditating and focusing your mind so you can cast magic if you need to down in the dero lair. Your thoughts of Francis are hard to block out completely, which is ironic considering your mental link with him is gone.\n\nYou really hope he’s all right.\n\nOf course he is. You can’t afford to worry about him right now, you have more pressing matters, and such distraction is beneath you anyway.\n\nYou immediately set off with your force to the dero community fully prepared to destroy their supposedly superior gates off their smug little hinges, but surprisingly when you get down there, the gates are open, with a few dero standing around near them.\n\nWhen they catch sight of you, one of them shouts something in their awful language to those on the other side of the gate and soon you see Marzost walk out to meet you\n\n“Ah, you’re finally here and with a good number of your people too, good. Might need them. Come on in.” Marzost says.\n“Wait, you’re letting us in?” you ask.\n“Well yeah. I mean much like the first time we met, I KNEW we’d eventually meet and make a deal with each other. I also knew that deal probably would be renegotiated at some point which might involve you…well doing what you’re doing now. Coming in heavy. I assure you though, not necessary. The time to let you fully into our community is at hand.”\n\nYou give Marzost a suspicious look.\n\n“You seem a little too eager for us to enter.” You say.\n“Hm, well if that seems like the case, well that’s because quite honestly, we don’t have anymore choice. We need your help and not just for breeding purposes, we need YOUR help specifically.”\n\nYou step back, slightly concerned on what he might be implying.\n\n“Marzost, if you believe I’m personally going to become some dero brood sow, you are sadly mistaken.” You say.\n“No, not that! I mean I’m to understand that you are the most skilled in the ways of magic of your people, which is fairly potent correct? Well, for our plan to work, we need your magic skills.” Marzost replies.\n“What plan?”\n“The plan to leave this doomed world.”\n“Leave?”\n“As I said, I can explain everything if you come inside where I can show you what I’m talking about and if you’re concerned about an ambush, don’t be, we’re in no position to do so.”\n\nMarzost turns around waving his hand for you to follow, you tell your people to do so, but to keep on guard.\n\nPassing through the gates and the outpost, you notice significantly less dero manning it. You know they haven’t all been going to the surface either, so you’re starting to wonder what’s going on.\n\nWhen you get through the outpost completely, the strong scent of burning flesh is in the air along with multiple fires. Looks like the dero have been having to deal with their own undead problem.\n\nYou look to your left and see a large circular stone archway. Or it would be a circular archway if the top portion of it wasn’t broken off and lying on the ground not far in front of it.\n\nYou haven’t seen many of them for centuries, but it’s a transporting gate. Explains how the dero got here like they did in the first place. Probably goes to a much larger area with them, but won’t be teleporting anything in that condition though.\n\n“Can’t get any reinforces anymore eh?” you say walking along side Marzost.\n“Wasn’t getting any to begin with. As I said, most of our kind is content on committing mass suicide. Still, we had dealings with them for resources and to leave things open in case others changed their minds.” Marzost says.\n“So what happened?”\n\nMarzost points to one of the burning piles.\n\n“You’re looking at what happened. Undead started suddenly coming through the arch. Hordes of them. Before we destroyed the archway, we even went through to the other side to see if anyone was left alive. There were, but the dero civilization such as it was is completely in chaos. Any stable pockets are a lost cause. The insane fools are prepping themselves, saying it’s time and dero all over are going to make this last march to the surface to die.”\n\nAhead you see a small settlement made up of stone buildings. You see a few armored figures moving in and out of the buildings. Marzost points to the settlement.\n\n“This place you see? THIS is the last example of dero civilization on this world.”\n\nMarzost then points to another smaller stone archway with several metal machine near it to the far right of the large cavern.\n\n“And THAT is where we going to restart our civilization. On a new one.” Marzost says.\n“You’re saying that leads to another world?” you ask.\n“Well, not exactly, but I’m convinced we have built it correctly according to ancient schematics. What’s lacking is a proper power source.”\n“Magic? I thought you rock eaters generally shunned it.”\n“Not entirely, we do embed runes in items and structures as you know which do tap into a magic source. Just works differently than waving your hands around. Combined with our advances in technology and we can create wondrous things.”\n“Hm, so wondrous that you need svelk help.”\n“Yes, there’s that svelk arrogance I was so looking forward to. I shall have to disappoint you in getting any enjoyment out of me humbling myself any more than I already am. The truth is, we are not getting any further with this project without your help, we need it if we’re going to survive.”\n“You keep saying that, but what about MY people? You claim this archway will take us off this world to a new one. Well how’s that helping us? Are we all coming with you?”\n“Of course. I mean assuming you can gather all your people from the continent; you can take as many as you want.”\n“I’m supposed to just instantly uproot everyone?”\n“You’re their leader aren’t you? Besides, weren’t you lot mostly nomads for centuries? Shouldn’t really be an issue right? This world is doomed. You know it is. All right thinking living beings know it is. Why stay and face certain death?”\n“That’s not a certainty yet.”\n“Isn’t it? The dero rock isn’t even keeping the undead out anymore. Necromantic magic is getting stronger everyday. Hell, I’ve had people feeling like their very life energy is getting sapped from them at times. Death is the only thing this world has to look forward to and I know you don’t want to be around here for that to happen. You wouldn’t be down here even entertaining my plan if you didn’t think it had merit.”\n\nMarzost is speaking some truth here, but once again you feel like he’s holding something back like when you first made the original agreement. And you imagine what that was now is that he and his band of stunted outcasts were busily building this archway to leave the world all along. Probably would have left without telling you shit if they didn’t need your help with it.\n\nThe concept of travelling to a different world isn’t a new one, but very few have actually been close to attempting it. Even the most powerful svelk mages of old generally ignored the idea as the government never wanted to put funding into staging an entire invasion of a brand new world, when they had to focus on keeping the empire they had on this one together. (Along with spending money on more immediate gratification for the nobles)\n\nThere were tales of success, but again these are very old stories and they usually ended up very badly such as the mage in question never being seen again or going batshit crazier than a dero at best. (Might be why the dero are fine with the risks)\n\nWhile you’ve been spending a lot of time going over various magic tomes, you still haven’t come across much about the subject, but then you haven’t gone through the demonology related tomes either. With maybe one or two exceptions, whenever the rare svelk mage did further research into this type of magic, in nearly every case, infernal assistance was involved in some way.\n\n“We can go to the dero hall and talk about this in more detail.” Marzost says.\n“I’m not going alone with you anywhere, now we can go over there away from the others if you want to speak a little more privately, but I want my army to be able to SEE me.” You reply.\n“Very well Mistress.”\n\nThe pair of you walk a distance away from any large groups to a quieter section of the large cavern. You of course still have at least visual range of your own people.\n\nMarzost mentions that his people are still trying to collapse a few tunnels that the undead dug out leading straight into the community. He says nearly all the corpses they put down were svelk so he’s assuming it was some old svelk burial ground.\n\n“Since I know you to be a woman whose practicality is only exceeded by her beauty, I’ll get to the point. The stone archway we designed doesn’t work because the natural magic crystals known as Trelite, we ONCE had to power such things are unavailable. ” Marzost says.\n“What, like you can’t get to them?” you ask.\n“Like there none in existence anymore. Last time a dero set eyes on one was during the time of the first collapse. Used them all up just trying to save our civilization and even that didn’t go as planned, but enough about history, we tried other types of magic crystals, but the results have not been promising. The magic power just isn’t there to open up a portal to a new world. At least not long enough to send through many people and even then the portal can’t be controlled enough to attune it to some place livable.”\n“So what is it that you want us or ME to do exactly?”\n“Well…and this isn’t ideal…but the svelk have had dealings with infernals…”\n\nYou shake your head and chuckle.\n\n“Hold on, don’t dismiss this before I explain.” Marzost says.\n“I’m not dismissing so much as I’m just laughing at how I was trying to avoid gaining infernal assistance against the undead and now this new option has presented itself and I’ll still need to call upon fucking demons.” You remark.\n“If we could trap a number of demons into some of these lesser crystals, say maybe fifty…”\n“Fucking fifty?”\n“…then we would certainly be able to have the power to open up a stable archway to a new world for us to escape to.”\n“There’s no guarantee that this will work and I’ll be taking ALL the risk not just summoning one demon, but at least fifty of the fuckers and trying to imprison them. I’m going to have to pull soldiers away from fighting undead just to put down any demons that try to escape”\n“You can have completely assistance from us, if you do the rituals down here. Besides, it will be more efficient to do so.”\n“The surrounding dero rock is going to make summoning even more difficult.”\n“True…but I suppose you could do it in the cavern clearing outside the main gates. It’s where the concentration is the weakest.”\n“Maybe, but this plan of yours still seems to involve me doing all the heavy lifting and I’m still not quite convinced that we can’t reverse the tide.”\n“Mistress, with all due respect, you KNOW that this world IS dying. Nothing can stop that now. The only thing that can be done is to flee as soon as possible and start over. I know this is asking a lot and from you especially, but I also know you reputation to not just survive, but also to thrive against impossible odds is well deserved. I KNOW you can save us all!”\n\nMarzost’s hand briefly touches your own as he leans in closer towards you.\n\n“That’s two.” You whisper to yourself.\n",
  "page 49": "If this lovesick fool desires you so badly, so be it. He’ll be useful for now, but the former deal is over.\n\nYou slowly move your hand away and address Marzost.\n\n“Yes, it does seem very likely that this world is doomed. I suppose there was just part of me that didn’t want to abandon everything I built and having to start all over again. I’ve had to do it several times and it’s a chore every time.” You respond.\n“I can imagine Mistress, but with this new opportunity you wouldn’t have to rebuild alone. We have already proven that we work very well together, perhaps when we both reach the new world, we can continue our alliance.” Marzost says.\n“Perhaps, but since you bring up our arrangement, I’m going to be helping you lot out in a major way with escape, so we will NOT be providing you lot with svelk females any more. There’s no point given the recent events, not to mention I’m trying to save MY race as well. Can’t do that if we give away all our females.”\n“Understandable. We’ve managed to keep most of the females you’ve provided alive anyway, so we should have enough stock when we reached the new world and from there hopefully we can find alternatives. Maybe even solve our own females’ fertility problems once and for all.”\n“That’s rather hopeful for you rock eaters.”\n“Yeah well, it’s one of the rare things we’ve maintained hope in. Of course this community is the only one still holding on to it. Still, the work continues and I’m confident that shortly after we get to the new world we WILL resolve the issue and no longer we will have to resort to being intimate with the females of other races.”\n“Being intimate? Interesting way to describe your…aggressive breeding strategy. Tell me though is that traitorous bitch Kessla still among your breeding stock?”\n“No, but she died only recently though. She managed to give birth to several young healthy dero for a few years.”\n\nYou chuckle at imagining her torment, meanwhile Marzost is still speaking.\n\n“As I said, most of the svelk females you have provided have survived longer than expected.”\n“Not surprising I suppose. We are a strong race, the females of our kind especially. I know you said you were the first natural birth, but tell me how many dero… intimacies did your mother survive before she was a useless husk to be discarded?”\n\nMarzost’s face shows a visible signs of discomfort at your comment. You’ve obviously hit some sort of nerve. He doesn’t even speak for a moment; he closes his eyes, exhales and then addresses your question.\n\n“My mother was only with my father. She stayed with him and was not assigned to a breeding facility despite protests by many dero technologists who wanted to explore why she was able to get pregnant in the first place by a dero. Fortunately my father was a powerful man and commanded much loyalty to many in the community at the time. As for how many intimacies they had, well I can’t say as I know as I wouldn’t dwell on such things, all I do know is their first resulted in me, and their last resulted in her death and a stillborn sibling.” Marzost says.\n“Hm. Interesting. So your mother cleverly avoided becoming breeding stock by charming your father.” You reply.\n“My mother LOVED my father and he LOVED her. They met after a dero raid on a human village in the Plains of Tor. His group was on their way back to the underground entrance when they stumbled upon a group of minotaurs and centaurs battling a svelk mercenary troop. They were winning quite decisively and the dero would have just passed them all, but the mindless mongrels only saw my father and his people as trespassers and attacked them as well. After my father won, the human females he’d taken from the village had all been killed and most of his soldiers as well. Picking through the spoils of the carnage, he found my mother among the bodies of the decimated svelk barely clinging to life. He took her with him and saved her from death.”\n“Well that explains how they met. Not sure if I’d call that love though.”\n“He treated her like a queen and she stayed with him and never tried to escape.”\n“She made the best of a bad situation, she was who knows how far underground and I’m sure your father would not have made it easy for her to escape. Having a semi-willing svelk woman on his arm would be quite a trophy.”\n\nMarzost now is starting to get exasperated. He’s not quite angry yet, but you’re enjoying making him approach that emotion. You briefly smile thinking about how Francis would get angry with you.\n\nMarzost once again composes himself.\n\n“Your reputation for mind games is well earned Mistress, though I’m not sure what advantage you’re attempting to get out antagonizing me as we have already reached an agreement.”\n“Just having a conversation. I haven’t spoken with many of your people and you are most certainly not the norm in all the others I have had dealings with. If I’m going to remain allies with someone, I want to determine if they’re fools or liars. I can handle the second one, the first I will not suffer. So far you seem intelligent and capable, so I’m trying to understand if you really believe these things you claim about your parents or if it’s just a safe delusion you tell yourself.”\n\nMarzost nods a bit.\n\n“I see. Very well, you may be correct with your implications that my mother did not love my father and merely tried to ease things for her own survival. It may even be the case that my father did enjoy having a svelk woman and kept her as some sort of trophy from an initially lousy raid. So yes that may be a nice lie I tell myself because it gives me comfort to believe that my parent’s love was pure and I was the result of it. Especially since it was a miracle I was born at all.”\n\nYou notice Marzost’s hand move forward towards you again and you instinctively move back so he’s unable to touch you. You expect him to still try, you even hope he does, but he merely continues with his monologue.\n\n“However, my mother took care of me for ten years before she died. I was never raised by dero nursemaids like so many others of my kind during that time. My svelk mother, insisted on raising me, caring for me, and loving me. Yes LOVING me. There can be no doubt that this wasn’t true regardless of what you may otherwise imply. If that makes me a fool to believe that, then so be it.”\n\nMarzost looks at you expecting your response. You have one of course.\n\n“Fair. You would know better than I since I wasn’t there. You have to understand, I’ve lived a very long time and see the negative in nearly everything because it tends to be true. The idea of a svelk and a dero being together in any way, let alone having a child together is still a concept I have a hard time wrapping my brain around. In any case, your mother sounds like in interesting woman and at least you got to know her. Never knew mine, she died in childbirth. Fortunately my father was very loving…but that’s a tale for another time. Let us get back to the situation at hand.”\n\nMarzost seems pleased by your response. Not in an appeasement sort of way, but as if your words were “approval” of his explanation. Though honestly you do have a few more thoughts on the subject, but you’ve had enough fun probing and prodding for today.\n\nYou ask Marzost for the fifty crystals to take back with you since you want to get started right away on entrapping demons. He says they have more than enough and can give you more in case problems should arise, but he thought you’d perform the rituals down here where it would be more convenient and his people could help with any potential out of control demons.\nYou say you’d be more effective at your own location away from magic nullifying rocks and where you can have unhindered magic power in case something goes wrong. You also mention that you have more than enough peons to assist in demon wrangling if need be.\n\nMarzost seems a little disappointed that you won’t be spending more time here, but understands why saying he trusts your judgment in these matters of demonology. He then leads you to the location of the arch that is presumably going to lead everyone to a better world.\n\nWhen you arrive, you can better see the machinery hooked up to the arch and many indentations in it where it looks like something would be inserted. You’re guessing crystals in this case. You also see the machines being maintained by a very rare sight, a couple female dero. They don’t look much different body wise, though they do not have facial hair like the rumors usually indicate.\n\nThe pair of them see you and their dislike is as obvious as Marzost’s infatuation with you. Marzost addresses them.\n\n“Count out fifty crystals and hand this woman a bag of them, she will be assisting us directly in powering up the archway.” Marzost says.\n\nOne of the dero women spits on the ground near your boots.\n\n“This one? She looks like more breeding stock to me, and even then given her hips I doubt we’d get many out of her.” She says.\n“Well your men would certainly get more ugly little dwarf monsters out of me than out of you. Jealous?” You reply.\n“Feh, another quick tongued svelk bitch. You all are until you’re properly broken, then you’re as submissive as any mewling human. You’d be no different.”\n“You seem to have the advantage of coming across more svelk women than I dero women, so I’m afraid I have no witty retort to your assessment. I can only hope that their sophistication and beauty will be a great asset when passed on to future dero that you are unable to provide.”\n\nNow you’ve angered the female dero to the point where she moves towards you, along with her friend. Marzost of course steps in before it comes to violence as expected.\n\n“Dakzat! Enough! Do as you have been ordered!” Marzost commands.\n\nDakzat looks at Marzost, barely containing her contempt for him, but follows orders. She motions to her friend who goes and grabs a few handfuls of various colored crystals of varying sizes in a pile nearby. It’s sort of curious to you that such valuable things are just laying around without much care, but you suppose dero are used to mining such things with such ease they don’t think much about it.\n\nFifty are counted out and put in a bag, which is then passed to Dakzat who then practically throws it at your head. You dodge and manage to grab the bag with one of your hands.\n\n“Thanks, I shall endeavor to provide speedy assistance to ensure your survival. Hm come to think of it your whole race’s survival has been due to svelk women hasn’t it? I imagine when all this is over, you lot on the new world can build a statue dedicated to svelk femininity as thanks to all we have done.”\n\nOnce again your words anger the dero women while Marzost is already trying to move you along. The more amusing part is despite the fact you’re well aware you weren’t exactly helping matters, he’s actually apologizing for their behavior.\n\n“I apologize for the hostility. This whole arrangement with your people has been very difficult for our women.” Marzost says.\n“I would think they’d be used to their men ravishing non-dero females.”\n“Eh, yes. But svelk females are different than that of other races.”\n“Well of course, we’re superior. But aren’t we all just breeding stock to you lot? Not like they’re all ending up in a situation like your mother and father.”\n“No, but…well…”\n\nMarzost stops as if he’s said too much. Now you’re genuinely interested.\n\n“Well what?” you ask.\n“It’s complicated.” Marzost says.\n“Does it affect our alliance?”\n“…I suppose in a way it does…”\n“All the more reason to tell me then, because I don’t want secrets if it affects something so important. Can’t have trust with keeping secrets.”\n“Very well, but I hope that you keep this only to yourself because this is VERY private knowledge. ONLY this community knows about this.”\n“Heh, no problems there. I don’t tell my underlings any more than they need to know. Makes assassinations less likely that way.”\n\nMarzost looks around to make sure nobody else is lurking nearby and tells you. (He attempts to touch you again, but you make sure to step back to avoid his wandering hands)\n\n“As you’re probably aware, the offspring between a dero and a non-dero, ALWAYS results in another pure dero. There is never any trace of the other race at all. We perfected the process to ensure this. Humans, orcs, kobolds, trolls, even your light skinned elven cousins do not dilute the dero blood.”\n“Yes, I’m aware.”\n“Well, the svelk dero offspring are different. There is still a very faint trace of the svelk blood. We don’t know why and it can’t be eliminated, or if it can, then we haven’t figured it out yet. This impurity is very distressing to some dero, most of the women especially. They believe it changes our very being to the point that this new generation of dero won’t be true dero. They believe that if this process goes on too much longer, it potentially means the end of our race even if we DO escape to a new world.”\n“Interesting. It would seem that svelk superiority reaches every aspect of life. So given that you have svelk blood coursing through your veins I imagine you don’t share the more puritanical views of your fellow dero given your own mongrel status.”\n“No. The impurity is negligible and the survival of our race despite any potential alterations to it is more important. Enough dero feel the same way, but doesn’t make this arrangement any easier. In any case, opening the arch and getting to the new world is top priority. Now are you sure you won’t need assistance with the task as I said we can…”\n“And as I said, I will work better on my own with this. However, if I need your assistance, you’ll be the first to know. Now then, I shall take my leave.”\n\nMarzost nods at your interruption and escorts you back to your army where upon you make your way back to the surface still making mental notes of all this information you’ve learned wondering if any of it can be used to your advantage at some point.\n\nThough for now, it’s not going to help you with the shitload of demons you have to summon and trap. You’ve got a lot of tomes to go over when you get back.\n",
  "page 40": "Never let it be said that genocide doesn’t resolve all problems.\n\nStill, these are dero you’re talking about so you’re going to need a greater force than you currently have. You’ll also need Kessla to say the password to the dero door.\n\n“Thank you Kessla, not only have you been very helpful, but you’ve also extended your life by a few moments.” You say.\n“Great. How long exactly?”\n“Hrm, at least a few days. I’m going to have to get a sizable invasion force over here since the amount I currently have left from putting an end to your little rebellion probably isn’t going to be enough for a dero stronghold.”\n“So you’re going to wipe them out?”\n“I thought that was obvious when I said I would be amassing an invasion force. In any case, your presence seems to have put Drunni in a better mood, so maybe I’ll leave you in his care at least until this dero business is over with.”\n“You fucking bitch.”\n“Hrm. Well I suppose I couldn’t have expected anything wittier than that.”\n\nYou call to some nearby soldiers to take Kessla away and make the preparations to gather another assault force. You figure you’ll have Gikil head the invasion. Give him something important to do.\n\nNow with Dokkrus reunited, (or at least not in open rebellion anymore) you can focus on a more concentrated defense. You still aren’t sure what you’re going to do about stemming the tide of undead though. The only thing that comes to mind is trying to scour old magic tomes to find potential answers.\n\nYou wonder about Francis and if maybe perhaps he is coming up with ideas of how to stop it, but then you shake your head that he’s probably fumbling about in the dark more than anyone about this. He was the one that caused this after all, why the hell would he have any idea of how to stop it. He is a child. A child that needs discipline. If only your hands hadn’t been tied, you could have whipped him into shape better.\n\nIn any case, you get ready to head back to your fortress; you’ve got a lot of work ahead of you.\n\nTwo months pass…\n\n“He’s fucking dead?” you exclaim.\n“That is what the latest reports say Mistress. Apparently there was just enough of his face left to identify it as Gikil.” Drunni replies.\n“Fuck!”\n\nYou throw a nearby vase against the wall in anger.\n\n“That incompetent dumb ass. I should have taken him off the assignment when he didn’t get the job done after one month. Are the dero finally destroyed at least?”\n“Erm, no. Apparently they have managed to refortify their gate and have actually been launching their own attacks by making tunnels in the area. The svelk outpost above the dero community is a killing zone and svelk forces have had to retreat outside the old rebel hideout so as not to be completely decimated. Of course this is starting to draw the attention of wandering undead, which are becoming more frequent on the continent.”\n\nYou shake your head in exasperation. You can’t believe things have gotten so horribly fucked up with this simple task. Granted you knew the dero weren’t going to be push overs, but you at least figured Gikil would have been able to handle a small enclave of them. And on top of it all he got himself killed in the process.\n\nYou’re starting to think that you might have to handle this yourself. You can’t trust a male to do this job, and even with the magical nullifying rocks, you’d still be able to assist magically. Just would take more energy on your part.\n\nYou’d have to levy more soldiers from the svelk communities into helping which won’t be popular, but then they’re going to bitch about your leadership anyway.\n\nOf course you could just pull back altogether and shore up defenses at the svelk strongholds. The undead are more of an immediate threat and what remains of the dero community probably isn’t going to venture too far from where they are. They didn’t when Kessla’s rebels were there after all and there was more of them then.\n",
  "page 42": "As much as you hate to do it, you’d rather not waste any more manpower on the dero. You’ll just have to be satisfied with what damage you’ve done and hope they more or less keep to themselves.\n\n“Just pull everyone out of the area, we don’t have the luxury of fucking around with them any more than we’ve wasted.”\n“Very well Mistress…um…I can still keep Kessla right?”\n“Yes, I already gave you permission that you could a month ago. Just make sure she stays your personal fuck slave. She escapes or anything like that and I’ll have you both executed.”\n“Understood. Thank you Mistress.”\n\nDrunni takes his leave. Honestly the only reason why you’re letting him keep her is ever since his “reunion” with her he’s been a lot more compliant and less argumentative. The more harmony you have the better you can get things accomplished.\n\nAnd you have a lot to accomplish. Namely going through a library of magical tomes to see if there’s anything that can be found to combat all this.\n\nTR 8\n\nYou should have wiped out the little bastards, no matter what the cost in manpower would have been.\n\nThe sounds of most of your left fortress wall collapsing can be heard as you have to keep your balance from the foundations of your own building begin tilting.\n\nNot only have the dero managed to sneakily dig under your fortress an undermine its foundations, but to make matters worse they funneled a large number of undead into the tunnel so not only do you have undead pouring in from the outside due to collapsing walls, but they’re literally popping up from underneath you as well.\n\n“Mistress we have to abandon the fortress before we’re completely overrun!” some soldier says running in to your bedroom. You’ve never seen him before, or if you have you don’t remember him.\n\nIn any case, he makes a valid point, though you still have all these books you have to go through. Even if you teleported, you wouldn’t be able to bring them all and you NEED to go through this shit, if you have any hope of trying to find a way to stop this.\n\nThere’s nothing for it except to pick and choose as much as you can. You wish you’d been a little more organized, not that would have helped much since there are books all over the place thanks to the building shifts.\n\n“Evacuation. Right. You male, what’s your…actually your name isn’t important right now. What IS important is you need to help me gather up as many of these books as possible.” You say.\n“But Mistress…” the soldier says.\n“That’s a fucking order! These books are more important than your worthless life ten times over! So be glad I’ll be teleporting YOU with me when we leave. Now then, I want you to look for any book with a dark red cover and made of vila flesh.”\n“Vila flesh?”\n“Vila, you know the..oh. You are a bit young looking, guess you wouldn’t know. Anyway, old race of fairies we exterminated a long time ago during the great days of the empire. About the only thing they were good for is making suitable covers for demonic tomes. Demons are always drawn more to items made out of so called pure beings.”\n“You’re going to summon demons?”\n“Well I don’t want to, but with the way things are going the option has to be on the table. Demonic assistance is always so unreliable though. Anyway you’ll know its vila flesh by the touch. Extremely smooth, not rough or leathery at all. Go, go, go, gather what you can find!”\n\nThe soldier starts looking through books and you do as well. Mostly focusing on tomes that aren’t demon related since you’re holding out hope that it won’t come to that.\n\n“Mistress, I feel I should also mention that commander Drunni is dead.” The soldier says.\n“What? Oh. Yeah, that doesn’t matter. Just find the fucking books! I don’t give a fuck about Drunni, he was an idiot anyway. Though out of curiosity how did he die?”\n“Well I wasn’t there, but another said Kessla got out of the cage he kept her in when the first wall collapsed and she ripped his throat out like some sort of animal.”\n“Hrm. Well more fool him for keeping her around as long as he did and not being more careful. If he was insisting on raping her on a regular basis, he should have cut her hands and feet off.”\n“I believe he blinded her, Mistress.”\n“Yeah well apparently that wasn’t good enough. Still could hear and smell him…speaking of which…attack!” you utter when you sense visitors getting closer.\n\nYou immediately blast the first corpse lumbering into your bedroom and several more with magic bolts. The soldier drops the books he’s acquired and draws his weapon.\n\nMore pour in, and you continue to back away while hitting them with bolts. Eventually enough push through and they’re starting to surround the soldier. Then things get worse when your building suddenly begins shifting downward again, causing everyone living and dead to fall down, in fact it feels like the place is going to sink completely.\n\nYou get up and run over to the soldier to help him out if only so you’ve got another person to help you get the books, which are now even more all over the place now, along with furniture and all your other belongings.\n\n“Male! Get that bag over there by that bed, empty it out, and start shoving those books I told you about in it. Can’t afford to be picky now. When it’s full, tell me and we’ll get out of here!” you order.\n“Yes Mistress!”\n\nWhile the soldier is following your orders, you take on the corpses which are starting to get up off the floor. Under normal circumstances you’d just burn them all, but you can’t really afford to do that in this instance.\n\nYou attempt to freeze the horde which works to slow them down a bit. You then unleash a stronger cold blast, which begins to encase them in ice.\n\nYou then blast the ice with more bolts shattering the undead inside. You then go on the offensive, destroying more undead coming down the hallway. This is when you start to unleash fireballs as the danger of burning any books is now gone.\n\nThe strange thing is you begin to get so focused on battle, you forget that your goal was to escape. Instead, you continue to clear out undead masses invading your personal domicile.\n\nBefore you know it, you’ve battled all the way to the entrance of your domain where upon you see nothing but destruction and carnage outside. More undead are lumbering about and they’re starting to gather towards your position again.\n\n“Shit, I need to get back.” You say to yourself and run back to your bedroom.\n\n“Male! We need to go, where the fuck are…”\n\nYou see the soldier laying on the floor with his throat ripped out. Nearby you see your open bag with torn up books strewn nearby.\n\n“Wha… no, no, no, no! SHIT!” you shout as you go over to the shredded books, which are completely ruined.\n\nYou throw one of the destroyed books at a wall nearby furious about the situation and then you see the dead soldier getting back up.\n\n“Oh shut the fuck up.” You exclaim and cast a stream of flame at him, not even caring about the books that are destroyed nearby.\n\nAs the soldier starts to burn to a cinder, you quickly pick up the bag and with a deep exhale, you start gathering up what books that still might be of use and are still intact.\n\nAfter collecting a couple books, you then realize…\n\n“Wait…who killed that soldier….”\n\nYou soon find out too late when someone jumps on your back and bites you on the shoulder as you fall face down on the floor.\n\nYou’re turned over and you see Kessla who is every bit as horrible looking as she sounds. You stare into hollow sockets and a scarred grinning face full of jagged bloody teeth. She’s obviously learned to cope with her handicap because even though you try to punch her off you, she easily senses your attempt by blocking and then raking your face with her long nails partially blinding you.\n\n“Heheheheheh I told you Mistress you should have just killed me huhuhuhuh!” Kessla gibbers madly as a chunk of your flesh falls out her mouth.\n\nShe fills it again soon by going for your throat and ripping it out. You still aren’t quite dead yet before you see her nails go for your eyes.\n\nOne last surge of extreme pain follows, then darkness, then nothing. Well not quite.\n\nNothing following would have been a blessing. Where you go after is a much worse fate.\n",
  "page 41": "There’s nothing else for it, you have to destroy them completely. If you don’t they’ll just dig under you and launch ambushes right in your own homes. Especially now that you’ve attacked them and they aren’t getting svelk women from Kessla anymore.\n\nYou tell Drunni to go to the invasion encampment with some reinforcements and try to get shit organized again. You tell him to just keep a guarded perimeter around the area and keep an eye on things. Drunni isn’t exactly pleased to do so, but ever since you allowed him to keep Kessla around as a fuck slave, he’s been in a better mood, so he complies without much grumbling.\n\nYou spend the next few weeks teleporting to all the major svelk strongholds emphasizing the danger of the dero threat and in particular their lust for svelk women since Kessla and her rebels were offering them up as payment. It’s enough to cause concern in your female population and as such your male population follows. Raising a large army isn’t as much of a problem as you thought it might be, but you have to be careful to not take too many to leave svelk centers completely defenseless.\n\nEventually the time comes for the attack. Drunni says there hasn’t been any unusual activity from what he could tell. He says they even did some minor scouting of the rebel hideout and there weren’t any signs of dero. He believes they’re probably expecting a big invasion and are waiting for your attack.\n\nYou come up with a plan to send in another group of scouts to secure the upper level. Make sure there aren’t any traps or anything like that first.\n\nAfter the upper level is secure, you and Drunni enter with a large group of elite warriors by your side. You make your way past the now destroyed door to the dero community and down the stairway. With some effort you manage to cast a protective barrier around yourself and your front row.\n\nEventually you reach the bottom and walk until your reach a large open area. Up ahead is a huge gate that has obviously been pieced back together and reinforced with large stones in front of it. Doesn’t take long before the guttural sound of deros shouting in their awful language.\n\nThis is it.\n\nThe dero fire upon you and your people immediately, but your magic barrier holds. You don’t know for how long though since you’re attempting to summon up enough magic to blast through the gate.\n\nDrunni orders the warriors to start firing their crossbows at whatever they can see, the problem though is the dero are small targets standing high above behind battlements and encased in very heavy armor. Even in the small chance of hitting them, it’s unlikely going to be an instant kill.\n\nStill, it’s enough to act as a distraction while you unleash a large blast of lightning to the gate.\n\nYou manage to blow the dero gate off its smug little hinges. Not enough to completely destroy it, but it’s open and the dero aren’t going to be repairing it anytime soon.\n\nOf course it’s took a lot out of you and you fall to one knee in exhaustion from the ordeal. You also don’t have it in you to maintain the protective barrier. The dero take advantage and fire into your ranks taking out several of your people.\n\nDrunni actually takes the initiative, telling everyone to spread out and advance inside as quickly as they can. He even goes to check on you.\n\n“Mistress, are you alright?” Drunni asks while trying to lift you up before you push him away.\n“Yeah, yeah, I’m fucking fine. Let’s just finish this shit.” You answer and stand back up and cast the protective barrier over yourself and those within your immediate vicinity.\n\nThe battle is a slaughter on both sides, but you’ve got the edge due to numbers, it’s barely enough though. In fact if you hadn’t been assisting with your magic, this could have easily been another loss.\n\nThe most difficult fight is around the nursery and breeding facility. The dero females don’t give an inch without at least several of your own paying the price. The svelk women still being held there are in a sorry state. Some are barely even alive. Almost all of them are begging for death, which is given not so much as a mercy, but more because they’re useless and would be a drain on resources.\n\nThe dero fought to every last man, woman and even child. It’s a bit odd that they fought so hard given what you know of their race being generally fatalistic with this situation. Why bother to fight when everyone is going to die anyway? Then again Kessla did say they split from the rest of their society.\n\nBy the same coin, you’re sort of surprised they didn’t just escape when you broke through if they were so determined to live. You doubt you would have been able to follow them into any tunnels they dug. They must have really believed they could win.\n\nDrunni and those that survived say they haven’t found any survivors hiding or lurking about.\n\n“Looks like we got them all or at least haven’t found any tunnels or anything.” Drunni says.\n“Yeah I don’t think any tried to escape considering their babies were still in their cribs. Dero are pretty protective of their spawn. If they tried to escape, they would have most certainly taken them and not left them for us to bash against the stone walls.” You reply.\n“Guess that’s true. Are we heading back?”\n“Soon. I’ll send a crew here to gather the valuables, weapons and such when I get back.”\n“Okay, well I guess I’ll head up then and SHIT, look out!”\n\nDrunni points out a figure that comes out of the shadows. It’s a dero, though he’s not crazed or grizzled looking for one of his kind. He’s also not encased in heavy armor and is wearing simple clothing. He’s also got blood on his head.\n\nHe carries no weapons at all and has his hands raised.\n\n“No need for alarm. I’m not armed.” He says in a calm tone.\n\nA bit unusual, but since you seem to have the advantage you don’t kill him immediately.\n\n“How long have you been hiding? Since the beginning of the battle or just when you knew you were going to lose?” you ask.\n“I actually wasn’t hiding. During the battle with all the canons and magic flying around, a loose stone fell on my head and knocked me out. Damn fool me for not wearing a helmet I suppose. By the time I woke up, you lot had already made your way into the heart of the community and were mopping up the survivors. Didn’t seem to be much point in charging into battle at that point, so I just waited.”\n\nThe dero looks around and sighs.\n\n“I like to think I would have given you more of a fight had I been conscious to lead my people better.” The dero remarks.\n“Wait. YOU’RE the leader of this pathetic community?”\n“I am, or was. I’m Marzost. I’m guessing you’re the infamous Mistress. Kessla mentioned you many times. Wait, are you Drunni? She mentioned you as well. Didn’t have fond words for either of you.”\n“Yeah well she’s not saying too many negative things anymore, especially not with my cock in her mouth all the time.” Drunni interjects.\n“Hm, well I knew it was only a matter of time before you got her, knew it was only a matter of time before you confronted us as well. I just thought it wouldn’t need to come to this. Why the hell did you attack in the first place? We didn’t do anything to you.”\n“Didn’t do anything? And I suppose those svelk women were in that breeding chamber of their own free will eh? You were also assisting svelk rebels.” you say.\n“Hey that was Kessla and the old dero leader’s agreement., not mine. Had it been up to me, I would have approached you to deal with immediately. I knew of your reputation. And I will say, you are every bit as magnificent looking in person. I’m privileged, to have seen you before my death.”\n“Well at least you know what awaits you, though I’m still baffled to as why you didn’t at least put up a fight. I mean just surrendering when all your people fought to the death seems unworthy of a leader that is willing to die with them.”\n“Oh. I think you’ve misunderstood. I’m not surrendering.”\n“While I don’t doubt a muscular rock eater like yourself could snap my neck with your bare hands, I guarantee you’d be dead before you’d make it to me or Drunni. I also see no weapons or even armor. Unless you’re going to surprise me and claim to be a magic using dero.”\n“Hah, well I wish I had that sort of surprise. I do have one though and I don’t need to get any closer than I do right now.”\n\nDrunni’s eyes widen and suddenly runs, you aren’t sure exactly what Marzost is going to do, but you know you have to stop him fast. You can’t believe you were so foolish to not kill him immediately. You start to cast a spell, but its too late, Marzost quickly pulls out two large dark red crystals out of his pockets and with a crystal in each hand he slams them together creating a large explosion.\n\nIt’s enough to bring most of the ceiling down and create a cascading effect on the area as a whole. You getting crushed by falling rocks though is not a concern since you were killed immediately by the initial explosion.\n\nA quick death, though what awaits you in the afterlife isn’t so quick unfortunately.\n",
  "page 161": "There are too many holes in this woman’s story.\n\nThe major thing though that’s given you pause isn’t her story; it’s what she’s trying to do. You realize that she’s trying to maintain eye contact with you for as long as possible to mesmerize you into dropping your defenses.\n\n“Y’know what? Fuck you and your big tits.” You say rubbing your eyes with one hand and bringing forth your garden to attack the vampire with your other hand.\n\nSeveral vines spring from the ground rooting her to the spot, and then followed by several branches impaling her. She screams and hisses until one hits her heart causing her to disintegrate.\n\nWith the bloodsucker dead, you go over to the ashes pondering the woman’s story again.\n\nWas it possible she was your mother? You doubt it mainly because you can’t imagine a party whore like this woman was claiming to be would have risen so high in the Vampire Clans, if indeed they would have even bothered.\n\nThis woman was also powerful enough to attempt to mesmerize you so she had to be a lot older and thus more powerful vampire than what your mother would have been even if vampirism stopped her aging.\n\nMore likely some sort of magical facial alteration along with some superficial knowledge of your background was used to try to trick you by tugging at your emotions.\n\nWouldn’t have worked even if she had really been your mother. Your biological mother didn’t raise you, that task belonged to a woman long dead and much more respected. And you can imagine that woman would definitely not approve of how your life turned out.\n\nMakes you wonder about who your parents might have been though. Were they wizards? Did they perform necromancy? Are they still alive or dead? Did you indirectly or directly kill them? Did they know about you? Did they think of you at all?\n\nYou suppose none of it matters now.\n\nFeeling somewhat out of the mood of enjoying your music and garden, you return to the citadel fully expecting Azrael to show up soon. You dismiss all the claims the woman made about the Vampire Clan putting an end to him.\n\nHe’s survived worse, and he’ll survive this too.\n\nYou haven’t gotten back to the citadel long when all of sudden Azrael shows up just like you knew he would.\n\nHe’s different though. You sense it immediately. You notice he’s got some severe wounds on his body causing you to make a remark of the obvious.\n\n“Catalina, I’m fucking dead.” Azrael says sharply and enters his study without another word.\n\nAnd that would be what you sensed. No life. Apparently he didn’t survive.\n\nBut he did.\n\nYou reflect on what this possibly might mean. As far as you know other than vampires, the only other forms of higher undead are liches and the process of becoming one is very difficult and complex. Very few necromancers have succeeded in doing it and the last one that did was The Great Lich Lord who lead the Dead War centuries ago.\n\nAzrael couldn’t have performed such a complex spell in the middle of not only destroying Velzix, but presumably the Vampire Clan as well, could he?\n\nYou intend on finding out, so you enter Azrael’s study and find him at his desk with a quill and parchment.\n\n“I need some time alone. I have to write a letter to my mom and sister. They should know about what really happened with my dad, even if the rest of the world won’t.” Azrael says, not looking up.\n“I’ll leave you alone as soon as you clear some things up about what happened to you and the Vampire Clans.” You remark.\n\nAzrael looks up and puts down his quill.\n\n“Well it’s very simple Catalina. I foolishly trusted the wrong person, went head first into battle and got myself fucking killed. Then I came back to life and killed every leech in that hidden lair of theirs.”\n“You killed all the vampires?”\n“Oh I’m sure there probably were a few that weren’t there, but that hardly matters. They’ll all be hunted down and put to death eventually. Everything will.”\n“Are you alright?”\n“Yes, I’m fine, I’m just dead.”\n“I’m not talking about your newly acquired physical status so much as I’m asking about your mental state.”\n“As I said, I’m fine. I’m just tired.”\n“Tired?”\n“Yes, and I’m well aware how strange that may seem given that I’m dead and all now, but nevertheless it’s true. Everything’s strange though now.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know how to explain it, at least not yet. I’m still trying to figure it all out. I don’t even know how I came back to life. I just did. What does this mean? If I’d gotten killed before Lord Rostov snapped my neck, would I have come back anyway or did I just get to a point where it was possible? I performed no ritual that would cause me to ascend to lichdom. Shit, I never even bothered to look into it too deeply. Everything I do when it comes to necromancy just comes so naturally. Was my ascension to this state natural too? Is fate or destiny at work?”\n\nYou’ve not seen Azrael quite like this, even you aren’t sure how to respond.\n\n“Are you in pain?” you ask.\n“No. I don’t feel anything at all. Well, I suppose I shouldn’t say nothing at all, but everything is muted now. There’s something else though, I’m not exactly sure what it is yet, but I imagine without feelings getting in the way of things, I’ll reach it.” Azrael says.\n“I see. So…what of your feelings for me?”\n\nAzrael looks at you and you see concern on his face. Mortal emotions haven’t disappeared completely.\n\n“Those remain Catalina. Those will never leave me. I won’t let them.” Azrael says and he goes to embrace you. You hold him tightly and you can already feel the difference, the cold dead flesh. It feels like you’re in paradise.\n\nYou look up at him and passionately kiss him. He kisses you back, and yes, the desire is still there, but again, it’s different.\n\nThere’s part of you that wonders if his feelings for you will dull in time, but it doesn’t matter. Your feelings won’t. His deathly glory just keeps growing greater and there is no way you’d ever be able to resist it at this point.\n\n“I guess I’m more attractive to you than ever now right?” Azrael says with a grin. You’re glad to see he hasn’t lost his same goofy sense of humor.\n“Mmm, why don’t we pick this up later? I know I distracted you from an important task.” You say.\n“Yes, I suppose I should finish that, but I’ll be with you soon.”\n“I’ll be waiting.”\n“Oh, while I was gone, did anything of importance happen here?” Azrael asks.\n“Not really. There was a very minor vampire assassination attempt, but I took care of it personally since it was just one.” You answer.\n“Hm. Just one huh? Unusual, since they usually sent several in the past, but maybe most of them were at their secret fortress just to ambush me.”\n“Maybe. Well one less for you to worry about hunting down.”\n“True. Okay, I need to write this letter. I don’t even know what the hell to say to my mom and sister. I doubt I’ll get a response. Catalina, you really are lucky that you were an orphan.”\n“Yeah, I suppose so.”\n\nAnd with those words, you take your leave of the study and head to the bedroom.\n",
  "page 160": "You sit in your garden relaxing to your music. You do that a lot more nowadays now that all major threats are gone.\n\nAll the demons are dead, all the vampires have been hunted down, and the civilizations of the living have all been destroyed.\n\nEven that fool Trelik who surprisingly turned out to still be alive (and completely mad from his use of chronomagic) had been taken care of again. You’re somewhat surprised when he popped up again that he never tried to attack you like he once threatened the last time you saw him, though you guess all his obsessive hatred was towards Azrael at that point.\n\nLife still exists, but the clock is ticking on it. The remnants now huddle together in enclaves, thinking that’s going to protect them. Like somehow the Great Lich Lord won’t find them and they can just wait this out.\n\nThey can’t. Death is inevitable. Your beloved will see to that. Even now his aura can be felt and he’s currently not even in Aftermath. He’s not even near Aftermath, he’s half way across the other side of the world rooting out a stronghold of the living no doubt.\n\nHe will bring beauty to the entire world.\n\nYou watch the gravewings flutter about as the banshees wail. It’s almost like they’re in unison with each other. You didn’t train them to do that though. You had a hard enough time getting the banshees to emulate instruments. Still not perfect, but it works well enough to compliment the string section.\n\nYou suddenly sense a large group of living approaching. This would be most odd since Aftermath hasn’t had any living subjects in a very long time and all the other necromancers eventually left to be assigned to other locations during the Grand Alliance war.\n\nCan’t possibly be an attack. Who the hell would still be organized enough to dare? Let alone even get past the defenses of the city. They would be killed before they even got into the gates.\n\n“Catalina? Are you in your garden?” you hear a voice shout.\n\nSounds like Hessan, though you haven’t seen him in like over a decade you think. You can’t imagine what he’s doing here though, you though he was currently overseeing the Retlad Kingdom (or what remains of it).\n\n“Hessan, is that you?” you shout back.\n“Yes! I didn’t want to enter since I know how you enjoy the solitude of your garden.” Hessan shouts back.\n“Well you might as well enter since you’ve already disturbed me. Why are you here anyway?”\n“Well that’s what I’ve come to speak with you about.”\n“Okay…so come on in and talk then, I’m not going to spend this unannounced meeting shouting.”\n“Um…well it’s not just me. It’s all of us from the Dark Order. Wouldn’t want all of us accidentally trampling all over your lovely garden.”\n“Yes, I sensed there were others with you. The rest can stay out, I presume I only need to speak with you.”\n“Actually, several of us need to speak with you, it really would be better if you came out here.”\n\nYou shake you head.\n\n“I’m coming, but this better be important.” You say with exasperation.\n\nYou make your way towards the entrance of where Hessan’s voice was coming from and just outside the walls of your garden, you see Hessan, Belial and the rest of what remains of the Dark Order.\n\nThey all look old. Like much older than they should be. These people weren’t but a few years older than you and you still look as young as you did in your twenties. Necromancy takes a toll on the body, but you remember a theory that Mr. Demar mentioned before he died that perhaps due to your strong ties to nature magic, it didn’t affect you as much.\n\nYou never gave it much thought really. For all you know, you’ve remained unaging due to your pure love for death.\n\n\n“Wow, not to be out of line, but you look great Catalina. Some of us have tried magic to restore our youth, but it doesn’t seem to last very long to be worth it. What spells do you use?” Hessan remarks in an attempt to flatter you obviously.\n“I don’t, and what do you want?” you ask still standing within the boundaries of your garden.\n“Catalina, we come to you with all respect. All of us were originally in the Dark Order together.”\n“Get to the point Hessan.”\n“It’s about Azrael.”\n“Yes, what about him?”\n“He’s killing the world.”\n“And?”\n“And? Don’t you see that there might be a problem with this?”\n“Not really.”\n\nYou look at Hessan who still looks a bit concerned. Belial’s face is showing a different expression though and looks back at the other Dark Order members. It’s a more defiant expression.\n\n“Catalina, it’s not just that he’s killing our enemies. He’s killing ALL the living. Just last week he snuffed out all the lives of several subservient living peasants in our territories.”\n“So? Raise them and have them continue to work. You’re necromancers right?” you say.\n“Yes, we’re necromancers but the point of all this was to RULE over everyone, we can hardly do that if all our subjects are dead.”\n“Rule over the dead. It’s the same thing. Better in fact, since they don’t typically rebel.”\n“But…there are draw backs to this.”\n“Such as?”\n“Well…the dead don’t feel pain. At least not really. You can hardly strike fear in something that’s dead.”\n“Yeah! Without the screams of children, I can hardly reach climax!” someone shouts.\n“Shhh!” Hessan says.\n\nYou start laughing.\n\n“Wait, so this is what you lot are bitching about? You’re upset that your degeneracy has been inconvenienced? You lot haven’t changed since college.” You say.\n“Big words coming from the woman who fucks a walking corpse. You haven’t changed since college either.” A female Dark Order member says.\n“SHUT UP!” Hessan shouts.\n“Aww, someone upset that she doesn’t have demon cock to suck anymore?”\n\nHessan immediately points to the woman and basically tells her to shut up before she can even retort. You notice Belial shaking his head and rolling his eyes. It’s apparent Hessan is still trying to maintain order, but he’s losing control of the situation.\n\n“Catalina, it’s not just that. It’s just…we’re fucking DYING.” Hessan remarks.\n“We’re all dying, Hessan.” You say.\n“No, I mean Azrael’s presence is starting to literally kill us. Surely being so close to him, you’ve noticed yourself starting to get weaker. I don’t know what he’s doing, but at the rate he’s going, there won’t be ANYTHING left alive on this world!”\n“Can’t say I’ve felt the effects, Hessan. You know MAYBE it’s because none of you were real necromancers. I mean face it, you lot only started practicing it because the demon shit didn’t work out for you. Maybe if you lot fully embraced the beauty of death, you wouldn’t be complaining about this.”\n\nHessan struggles to respond, but Belial interrupts him.\n\n“I told you this was pointless Hessan, this bitch is crazy and she’s not going to help us.” Belial says.\n“Wait, you lot actually came here thinking that I’d help you kill Azrael? Maybe you have embraced death more than I thought.” You say.\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP Belial!” Hessan screams.\n\nOnce more Hessan addresses you still with hope that you’ll listen.\n\n“Catalina, I’m just asking you to speak with Azrael to pull back a little so we can prepare ourselves for the world he’s creating. We can get used to everything. I mean I have no problem becoming a lich, I’m sure none of us do. I mean I’m sure that’s what your plan is, right?”\n\nThe funny thing is despite everything that’s happened, you still haven’t considered lichdom.\n\n“I mean…fuck I’m big enough to admit it. I’m scared of fucking dying. I thought I was going to be a lord of hell, then shit got all fucked up and here we are. I made a pact and betrayed it. Now maybe you aren’t scared that you’re going to hell to be tortured for all eternity, but I KNOW there has to be some small part of you that’s not blinded by your love of Azrael or death. There’s a part of you that’s afraid of what IS awaiting you. Shit, you might even end up where we’re going. Not like you’re an angel in all this.”\n",
  "page 163": "You look at these traitors with contempt, but they have a numerical superiority and as powerful as you are, you don’t think you’d be able to take them all out.\n\nOne thing you can see though is despite most of them trying to give you intimidating looks, they’re ALL afraid. They all made pacts with hell that they most certainly didn’t honor and it isn’t going to go well for them when they die. (Honestly it wouldn’t have gone well for them regardless, but you imagine it will definitely be worse now)\n\nHessan might be the only honest one in that regard.\n\nHe’s also not wrong about you either.\n\nYou don’t dwell on it much, but there is small part of you that fears death despite your love of it. There have been times when you’ve been around Azrael and you’ve felt fear. Being around the being he’s become (and still becoming) is a bit intimidating at times, but it’s not just that.\n\n“You’re right Hessan, I do have some fears about Azrael.” You say.\n\nYour admission seems to surprise everyone. Hessan even looks a bit hopeful now.\n\n“Then…you do understand!” he remarks.\n“Yes. I understand why you’re all afraid of death, but you don’t understand why I am.” You say.\n\nNow Hessan’s face loses the optimistic expression again.\n\n“I’m not afraid of death because I’m afraid of where I’m going. I’m afraid of what I’ll be leaving behind. This city is practically all I’ve ever known. I’ve barely ever left these walls and I still don’t have any desire to if I can help it. The comfort this place has brought to my life and especially after its lovely transformation has been just one of the major blessings I’ve experienced. The second would be Azrael. The thought of leaving him is an even more difficult concept to accept, but I’m getting there.”\n“But…you could become a lich! That’s what we all can do!” Hessan says.\n“No. When my time comes, I will embrace its beauty and ascend to that next stage, whatever that may be. Much like how a coffinpillar becomes a gravewing, I’m not afraid of that.” You say.\n\nBelial says something again about you being crazy, causing Hessan to once again tell him to be quiet. You continue to speak.\n\n“Now, Hessan, I believe that you came to me in good faith. You’ve always been the most competent of the Dark Order. I can talk to Azrael, but I can’t guarantee anything. It’s the best I can offer. However, I will say, if you lot have plans on killing me as some act of pettiness, I probably wouldn’t be able to take all of you on.”\n“Damn right you wouldn’t.” Belial snorts.\n“However, I would imagine the retribution Azrael would bring down on my killers would be considerable and excruciating. I suppose that would be one way to ensure your life though since I imagine he’d keep you alive to suffer for as long as possible. And then on top of all that, you have hell to look forward to.”\n“What makes you so sure we couldn’t beat your dead lover?”\n\nYou laugh.\n\n“If you really believed that Belial, you wouldn’t have come here with Hessan who is begging me to try to whisper mercy into my beloved’s ear. Try to kill me if you wish, but as I’ve already said, you’ll gain nothing from it other than beloved’s wrath.”\n\nYour words only server to anger Belial and a few others further, but Hessan once again shakes his head.\n\n“Are you fools!? This woman is literally the only thing that might save us!” Hessan shouts.\n“Are you a fucking coward? You really think she’s going to talk to Azrael about this incident in a positive light? It’s obvious he’s going to kill us all anyway at this point, I say we get some form of revenge ahead of time by killing this bitch! Who cares if he tortures us? We’re already going to face worse in hell anyway!” Belial exclaims.\n“And I’m not going to let YOU potentially fuck up MY chance of immortality!”\n\nHessan unleashes a blast of dark energy at Belial, catching him off guard. He drops to the ground as a husk of his former self. A few other Dark Order members start hurling spells of their own. Amazingly they’ve all forgotten about you and are too busy trying to kill each other. You just sort of back away behind a spell shield and watch the mayhem.\n\nAfter a few more bodies drop, Hessan and those that agree with his plan manage to win the infighting. He looks over at you.\n\n“So you’ll talk to Azrael?” Hessan asks.\n“I will.” You answer.\n\nHessan nods and with that he and the rest of the Dark Order leaves. You return to solitude of your garden.\n\nAbout a day later, Azrael returns home.\n\n“Hello Azrael. I trust the purge of that dwarven stronghold went well.” You say.\n“Yeah, hardy, stubborn little bastards. Lot of anti-magic runes. Anyway, nothing happened here I trust.” Azrael says.\n“Oh actually something did. The Dark Order came here making demands.”\n“WHAT?!”\n“Oh yes, they were quite insistent on certain things. They couldn’t agree on what though, so a fight broke out. Anyway I’m fine and they all went back to their homes I imagine.”\n“Those traitorous assholes! They’re lucky I even allow them to rule over their lands. Well no more, we haven’t needed any of them for decades, one wonders if we ever did. I’m going to pay each one of them a visit now!”\n“I left a list on your desk of which ones are still alive.”\n“Huh? Oh thanks, I’ll grab it before I go.”\n“Oh, one more thing. Hessan tried to be a voice of reason, if misguided. Make his death quick and painless. He deserves that much.”\n“Alright.”\n\nAzrael kisses you before leaving to make the world more beautiful.\n\nYou suppose you’ll have to eventually tell Azrael that you won’t be becoming a lich, but for now this distraction will give you time to figure out how to tell him.\n\nIt will undoubtedly be the hardest thing you’ll have to do, but you’ll get through it. You both will.\n",
  "page 162": "You look at these traitors with disgust and you’re done even entertaining their half-assed attempts at treachery.\n\nYou waste no more words and blast Hessan with dark energy, reducing him to a husk immediately. Belial and the rest put up their own defenses and start to scatter, but they aren’t retreating so much as they’re just trying to regroup to a better position.\n\nYou call upon the dead in the city to assist you, though you know with the Dark Order they’ll undoubtedly be able to turn some of your troops to their side. You block the entrance to the garden with brambles and move back to the heart of it where you feel you’ll be safest.\n\nUnfortunately the Dark Order starts lobbing fireballs over the garden walls, setting everything aflame. You manage to put it out bringing forth a cold blast covering the area, but your garden is mostly destroyed by this point and the plants can’t be used as a means of defense like you planned.\n\nMeanwhile outside the walls of the garden, you hear the sounds of battle taking place. No doubt the undead under your control are doing battle with the Dark Order. Eventually several holes are put into the garden walls and undead start pouring in. You manage to take control of most of them again, but the main problem is as powerful as you are, you’re still very outnumbered.\n\nSome of the Dark Order get inside the garden and then a few more. You manage to take out most of them, but then you feel several magic bolts hit you, followed by a lightning blast. Another dark spell literally rips half the flesh off your body.\n\nYou collapse to the ground and in your current blurry vision, you see Belial approaching you with several skeletal warriors. You struggle to regain control of them and it’s just enough to cause one to suddenly run him through. He curses in agony as the rest of the skeletons stab him repeatedly.\n\nYou laugh as you see the remaining few Dark Orderites run off.\n\n“You can’t run you fools, death gets everyone eventually.” You laugh and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nNope, that wasn’t how things went. You were severely outnumbered; you definitely would have tried to get a better starting advantage if you were going to take them all on like that.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 165": "You’re so close to what you seek now, the memories are so vivid now that they’re almost real. Your mind recalls one of the more unexpected gifts you experienced.\n\nGets harder and harder every day. The effects of Azrael’s mere existence is killing you every minute and the closer you are to him, the process is undoubtedly sped up.\n\nYou don’t really have the energy to even go to your garden anymore and remain in bed a lot. Azrael brings some of the plants to you from your garden in an attempt to make you feel comfortable at times, but most of them die and eventually just disintegrate fairly quickly.\n\nYou can’t quite fit an entire orchestra in the room, but you have a few undead playing music for you. At least the gravewings are happily fluttering about feeding on the zombie musicians.\n\n“Do you need help? Here, let me help you.” Azrael says.\n\nYou smile at Azrael’s words. Despite becoming death itself, the man still manages to maintain his feelings for you. You honestly didn’t think he would. You even were accepting that would happen eventually.\n\nYou’re glad he did though. Of course he could just be faking, but even if he was faking, that still indicates that he cares enough to make you believe he still has the same feelings.\n\nHowever, he’s apparently brought you a “gift” and even seems excited about it. Obviously he’s not faking anything.\n\n“I’m fine, really. No need to fuss.” You answer and slowly get out of bed.\n\nAzrael hoovers around you thinking you’re going to fall at any time, but you’re not that bad off yet.\n\nEventually you get to the throne room and there you see in another chair in the middle of the room a man who looks as bad as you feel and probably feels worse than you do.\n\nAzrael mentioned he found him somewhere in the arctic wastes far north. He was a “hero” of the Zalan Empire at one time. You remember reading reports about him, you assumed he was long dead, but it just goes to show how strong someone’s survival instinct is.\n\nOther than his very worn clothing, the only thing he has is a mandolin in his hands. He looks very close to death and yet even now you sense defiance. Anger even.\n\nThis becomes very apparent when Azrael tells him to play for you and he boldly tells him no. You watch Azrael threaten the man to no avail. The man has lost everything, he doesn’t fear death anymore, and he can’t be intimidated.\n\nSince you know this will ultimately lead to Azrael making good on his threats, you decide to intervene since you would like to see if the man is as good of a musician as the stories claim.\n\nAfter calming Azrael down, you walk over to the man to speak with him. He isn’t any friendlier towards you. He doesn’t know how you can stand by death incarnate, let alone love him.\n\nYou attempt to explain, but even you know this will not sway the man. In fact, you doubt if your words alone will so you plan using a little magic.\n\nYou haven’t delved into your enchantment bag of tricks for a very long time, in fact, you haven’t really been casting much magic in general, but it seems now would be one of those times.\n\nYou don’t need much, just a little. The flow of your words will give that gentle “push” that is needed.\n\nYou speak with the man about the true nature of people and how everyone has suffered. You tell him he isn’t special and neither are you. What happened to him and what is happening now is inevitable. All things die and it isn’t something to rage against.\n\nThe man hears your words and relents. He doesn’t want to fight anymore. He’s so tired and ready for death.\n\nBut before doing so, he will be true to his nature, and play one last song.\n\nHard to tell if it was the magic or just your words were enough. You suppose it doesn’t matter, the results were the same.\n\nYou call Azrael back and the pair of you sit on your thrones, holding hands and listening to the man play his mandolin.\n\nAnd he plays just as lovely as you heard he did. He’s pouring what remains of his life into this song. Not for you, not for Azrael, not even for himself, but just because music was his nature.\n\nAs he gets to the last verse, you don’t even think he thinks he’s in your tower anymore. He’s somewhere else entirely. Some place where he’s happier.\n\nHe’s home.\n\nThe man slumps lifelessly in the chair and you stand up slowly to clap.\n\n“Well, he certainly looked happier than he did earlier.” Azrael says.\n“Yes, yes he did. Set his body on fire dear.” You say.\n“You don’t want him around to play for you later?”\n“No, I don’t think that performance could ever be replicated.”\n\nBefore Azrael does anything, you stop him.\n\n“Wait, seems a shame to burn the instrument. I’ll take it and give it to one of the corpses to play. I doubt if they’ll emulate the same sort of passion, but it’s still a nice reminder of what it produced.” You say.\n“As you wish.” Azrael responds.\n\nYou pick up the mandolin and start to walk back to your room while Azrael sets the man’s body on fire.\n\n“Azrael?”\n“Yes?”\n“Thank you for the gift.”\n\nAzrael nods and offers to help you to your room, but once again you tell him you’re fine and don’t need the help. You just need to rest. He respects your desire to not want help and returns to his mission.\n\nYou enter your room and get back on your bed where you study the mandolin a bit more. You didn’t notice the first time you picked it up, but there are small scratches along the bottom side of it. Looks like they were made with a knife.\n\nYou imagine defacing such a well-made instrument would be unthinkable to most musicians, but given what is written, maybe it was his way of being remembered.\n\nIt’s just one word.\n\nWilliam\n",
  "page 101": "You don’t have much time and you aren’t going to risk hurting yourself climbing on a shelf. You grab one of the books on the lower shelf that appears to be filled with drawings, lists of ingredients, symbols and words you probably can’t pronounce.\n\nThis looks like a magic book to you, so you take it and exit out the room. Fortunately the clerk is still preoccupied with help the others customers, so you manage to sneak out the front door with the book partially hidden under your arm.\n\nFrom there you head to your favorite area in the park eager to try something out. You flip through the pages, but it’s all pretty complicated. You can’t even read some of it as it’s in a language you don’t understand.\n\nStill, you keep looking and eventually you think you find something that looks easy. There are no words, its just diagrams of hand gestures followed by a picture of a jar floating off a table. Maybe this is a levitating spell?\n\nYou look around and see a nearby rock. You make your gestures and focus like you would when you wilted the flowers.\n\nYou focus…\n\nAnd focus…\n\nAnd then you see it lift up!\n\nYou feel a little dizzy though and this break in concentration causes you to drop the rock and sit down for a while.\n\nA period of tiredness has happened before during your practicing of magic so this isn’t new. You practice a few more times after resting a bit, then you decide to head back to the orphanage before it gets too late and Miss Olga is waiting for you by the door ready to yell at you as usual.\n\nYou head back to the orphanage trying to make sure there isn’t anyone around to see you come in since you can’t exactly hide the book entirely.\n\nYou manage to get to the sleeping room and so far the coast has been clear surprisingly. You figure you can hide this under your mattress and look at it when you can…\n\n“Hey creepy, whatcha doin’ over by your bed?” an annoying voice shouts.\n\nIt’s Patty.\n\n“Nothing. I’m just fixing my sheets.” You say trying to shove the book under the mattress quicker, it’s getting caught on something though. And that something is a spring, which causes a tearing sound.\n\n“You’re not fixing your sheets, you’re hiding something, what is it?” Patty exclaims and starts walking over to you.\n“Patty I’m not hiding anything, just leave me alone.” You say.\n“Catalina, you’ve always been creepy. You’re hiding something and I’m going to tell Miss Olga!”\n\nYou turn to face Patty directly.\n\n“Patty, you’re not going to say anything to Miss Olga. I’m going to give you one warning that you better leave me AND Chloe alone from now on.”\n“Pfft. I’ll do as I please to you and your pigfaced friend! What’re YOU going to do about it?” Patty exclaims, getting closer and now pretty much daring physical confrontation rather than tattling.\n\nPatty is going to give you problems if you don’t shut her up. The only thing you can think of is displaying your power to her so she becomes afraid and doesn’t dare speak against you.\n\nPart of you has honestly been waiting for this moment.\n\nYou waste no time in doing your newly learned hand gestures and focusing on lifting the fat girl.\n\nYou focus…\n\nYou focus…\n\n“What are you trying to do?” Patty asks.\n\nYou focus…\n\nYou focus…\n\n“Hey Patty, what’s going on?” another kid asks coming into the room with a few others.\n“This retard is being creepy as usual. Look at her!” Patty laughs as you continue to gesture at her wildly with no result.\n\nThere’s an audience now, but you don’t care if they all see what you can do. You’re going to teach Patty and anyone like her some respect.\n\nYou focus…\n\nYour nose starts bleeding and you begin to feel light headed.\n\nAt this point you’re getting mocked by Patty and some of the others but you don’t even hear them all you’re trying to do is attempting to lift this fat girl and finally…\n\n“Hey what…”\n\nYou see Patty lift up a few inches and you smile as you continue doing the hand gesture repeatedly.\n\nHowever, due to the pressure you’re under along with the distraction, you don’t do the gestures exactly. Little do you realize that a similar group of gestures causes a very different effect.\n\nAnd that’s when you see Fatty Patty explode spectacularly all over the room. Fresh warm entrails and blood splatter all over you as you collapse from the exhaustion.\n\nYou hear the screaming of the other kids as you lay on the floor awash in gore. You feel like you’re going to lose consciousness and you don’t care. You showed her, you showed them all. Then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nObviously that wasn’t how your life went. While it probably would have been satisfying to explode that fat little girl like a bloated tick, you didn’t actually do that. In fact something like that would have certainly resulted in you getting thrown in some asylum where they would’ve lobotomized you at best.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 100": "You MUST have that book, that’s the one that calls to you! You know everything you will need to know will be in THAT book!\n\nYou push the books aside and carefully pull yourself up on the bottom shelf. So far it seems sturdy. You then stand up on that shelf to try to reach the black book on the top.\n\nOne problem is you’re still too short to properly reach it, the second problem is the book is huge and even with attempting to pull at the edge to get a better grip, it’s definitely not easy.\n\nIt’s not light either.\n\nEventually you manage to get somewhat of a grip, but the weight of the book unbalances you, combined with putting some extra pressure on the shelf you’re standing on and well…it doesn’t take long for it to all go wrong.\n\nThe creaking groan of the wooden shelf can be heard just before it breaks causing you to fall with all the books following you and the large black book nearly landing on your head. A small fortune since you’re already pretty banged up from falling hard on the floor.\n\nYou’re in a bit of pain, though you try not to cry since you don’t want to make any noise, but that hardly matters due to all the noise caused by the fall in the first place. You’ve only managed to sit up when the bookstore owner comes to investigate.\n\nEven worse is what follows is a deep inhuman sounding voice. You look and the bookstore clerk seems different. You could have sworn he wasn’t as tall and you certainly don’t remember his voice being that deep.\n\nOne very major thing has changed which is his face. You actually can see his face and it isn’t human or maybe it WAS human at one time. Or elven? In any case, it’s melting before your eyes.\n\n“So little one, you’ve come here seeking forbidden magic have you? Well you’ve found you’ve found death. Now embrace it!”\n\nSuddenly the entire room disappears into blackness and you see images of people you know like Chloe and Miss Olga standing before you and their bodies withering away and rotting before your eyes. Gravewings flutter all around you and you’re spinning in the darkness just witnessing scenes of decay.\n\nFinally you see yourself and you begin to also decay. Gravewings land all over you and everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nObviously that wasn’t how your life went. You definitely didn’t try to steal a book, at least not that early in life and not at some used bookstore. You also doubt some forbidden necromantic tome would just be sitting so casually in said store, then again it wasn’t like you actually went there.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 105": "What are you even thinking about? Running away? You don’t seriously want to be living on the streets. You’re going back.\n\nYour concerns about your magic practices have subsided a bit anyway. As least as far as being in immediate trouble over them. You’re certain that nobody at the park noticed you and certainly nobody saw you bring the rabbit back to life.\n\nThough you believe you’ll have to give the park a rest for a while, especially since you figure Miss Olga is going to be angry with you with you get back so late. You’ll probably be restricted to indoors until you’re old enough to leave by law.\n\nAs strange as it is, there is a bit of comfort in that idea. Granted you were just thinking about how confining the orphanage can be, but it is home you suppose. You guess maybe that’s why you don’t really want to leave. It’s the only home you’ve ever known and despite everything, you don’t want that to change.\n\nYou eventually see the orphanage and prepare yourself for the scolding and potentially worse you’re going to get when you enter.\n\nYou get a few steps in and you already hear Miss Olga call you from the kitchen. No point in avoiding the inevitable.\n\nYou enter the kitchen and see Miss Olga cleaning her pots, plates and other cutlery. She’s not even bothering to look at you.\n\n“So, you have a nice time in the park today? You must have, if you’re coming in this late.” Miss Olga says.\n“Sorry Miss Olga I lost track of time.” You say.\n“You can’t tell when the sun is setting?”\n\nYou don’t answer. Miss Olga looks over at you and shakes her head.\n\n“I swear I don’t know what to do with you. It’s bad enough you left in the middle of adoption day as usual, but now you’re just coming and going whenever you feel like it.”\n“I’m sorry, I just…”\n“Just what Catalina? Just decide that you’re going to do whatever now? Fine. I’m done with trying to guide you.”\n\nYour eyes widen and back up when you hear this, thinking you’re on a one way trip to where Patty went. Miss Olga once again shakes her and sighs before speaking.\n\n“No, not that. Though I’m surprised you’re even worried about it given how little you care about getting adopted and how little you seem to respect me.”\n“I…do.”\n“Do what?”\n“Respect you.”\n“Huh. You have a funny way of showing it then child. In any case, it’s obvious I’ve failed to get through to you. I have several other children I have to worry about and I can’t constantly worry about you. So if you want to remain a parentless orphan drifting through and stay here until you have to leave, then fine. But if that’s the case, you WILL be pulling your weight more around here starting tomorrow. Go to the park all you want on your free time, but you’ll find you will have less of that soon, because you’ll be helping me with everything I have to keep up around here.”\n\nWell you sort of knew there would be repercussions, so you’re not exactly surprised. You’re just glad Miss Olga isn’t sending you away. As far as having more to do around here, well you were going to give the park a break for a while anyway.\n\n“Yes, Miss Olga.” You say.\n“Hm. Now head on up to bed and I’m sure Chloe is going to speak to you about her news as soon as you get there, but keep it brief. You’re going to have a lot of work tomorrow and you’ll need the rest.”\n“News?”\n“Well if you’d been here, you would have found out she got adopted today. In fact she would have probably left today, but I won’t just give her away to some man without proof of him having a wife. So he’s coming back tomorrow with her and if everything checks out, Chloe will be going to her new home.”\n\nYou’re a bit in shock. Miss Olga sees this immediately.\n\n“Yeah, she got adopted before you. Surprised me too. But then, it’s what she always wanted.”\n\nMiss Olga returns to her cleaning and you go to the sleeping area. You don’t know how to feel right now. There’s a part of you that feels hurt.\n\nYou know it isn’t Chloe’s fault, but you just thought she’d always be here with you and now she won’t be.\n\nFrom the description of the man, it sounds like the one you spoke to about his wife being sick. You guess he got over those assumptions he made about orcs.\n\nYou crawl into bed and immediately Chloe get out of bed and goes over to you.\n\n“Catalina! Where were you? The park?” Chloe whispers.\n“Where else would I be?” you answer.\n“True. Practicing magic I guess too. Well I wanted to tell you that something impossible happened today! I got adopted!”\n“Yeah, Miss Olga told me. Congratulations. It’s what you’ve always wanted.”\n\nChloe senses you’re not exactly in a good mood about this news.\n\n“Are you mad? Please don’t be mad! I…I could stay! Or…wait, he could adopt you too! He said you were talking to him earlier!” Chloe says.\n\nYou give a brief smile.\n\n“No. This is what’s best for you. You always wanted this and it was bound to happen that we were going to part ways eventually.”\n“Yeah, but I figured it would be you getting adopted, not me.”\n“Life is full of surprises. Look Chloe, it’s fine. I’m really happy for you. I mean it. Now I have to get some rest because Miss Olga is going to start putting me to hard work for all my park trips.”\n“Okay. Well I suppose it’s not final yet. Maybe he’ll change his mind or something and I’ll get to stay.”\n\nChloe’s words are followed by a pat on your shoulder before she returns to her own bed. You are left with your thoughts of the future, then sleep, then dreams of darkness…\n\nThe next day, you’re awakened from your sleep earlier and put to work by Miss Olga. She has you helping preparing breakfast for everyone. Since you’re not exactly knowledgeable on cooking, she still takes care of most of it, while you’re mostly doing preparation of the table and such.\n\nMost of the day passes with you doing a lot of cleaning. While Miss Olga has children pitching in to do chores, you’ve never had to do them like this. In fact, you realize all the times you snuck away to the park probably resulted in you doing less chores than the other children.\n\nNo sneaking off to the park today though.\n\nLater on, you see the man who spoke to you yesterday come in with a woman. You’re guessing this is his wife. She’s pale looking and walking slowly, you’re guessing he wasn’t joking about her being sick.\n\nHe sees you and smiles as you sweep the floor. You see Miss Olga greet him and his wife and they disappear into another room where she can presumably make the final judgment.\n\n“This is it.” You hear Chloe say, causing you to turn around. She looks very nervous.\n“I’m sure everything will go fine.” You reply.\n\nWhile Chloe offered to stay at the orphanage with you last night, now its very apparent what her desires really are. Even in all the mischief she’s been involved in with you, this is the most nervous you’ve ever seen her. You stop working for a moment to try to keep her from completely freaking out.\n\nYou start talking about all the new stuff she’ll soon be able to see and do. She says how much she’ll miss stuff here, which then leads to a series of “Remember when…” discussions, which takes her mind of things.\n\nTime passes and before you both know it, Miss Olga and Chloe’s perspective parents exit the room they were talking in.\n\n“Chloe, there you are. Good. Go gather whatever clothes and such you want to take with you, because today you’re going home with your new parents, Mr. and Mrs. Moznik or in your case Mom and Dad.”\n\nChloe upon hearing the news nearly collapses into tears of joy. You help her back up and her new parents come over to assist. You step aside and they both hug her and tell her to hurry up so they can show her her new room.\n\nChloe quickly nods and runs to get her stuff, which honestly isn’t a lot. Just a small bag of clothes.\n\nChloe says goodbye to Miss Olga who smiles and wishes her well. Chloe then goes to you.\n\n“I’m going to miss you so much.” Chloe says and hugs you tightly.\n“I’ll miss you too…okay that’s too tight.” You say.\n“Oh sorry. Hey I won’t forget about you! I mean I could still write to you or maybe even visit!”\n“Sure.”\n\nChloe turns to her new parents who take her hand and walk out with her. You stand at the entranceway with the broom still in hand watching her leave and get farther away until she’s out of sight.\n\n“That could have been you, you know.” Miss Olga says, walking to doorway to stand near you.\n“I know.” You reply.\n“You really don’t care do you?”\n“No, I guess not. Chloe needed it more than me anyway.”\n“Well I suppose she did at that.”\n“I hope it works out for her.”\n“I was a little concerned with Mrs. Moznik’s health, but they seem to be good people. I’m sure they’ll be fine.”\n\nYou look down and nod.\n\n“Catalina, I think you’ve done enough work for awhile, why don’t you go to the park for awhile. You can come back to help set up for dinner.” Miss Olga says.\n“No, I think I’ll stay here.” You answer\n“Very well then. You know what time dinner is.”\n\nYou nod and go back to your sweeping.\n",
  "page 104": "Always hard to recall exactly all the details of a past life in this existence no matter how long you’ve been at it.\n\nSo far you’ve lived through what you’re sure was your past. You’re fairly certain at least. You’ll soon know if you’re wrong.\n\nThings at the orphanage didn’t really change excessively after Patty was transferred. The only thing that changed was that most children were afraid of you even if some of them didn’t know why exactly. Nobody knew about your magic powers except Chloe and she never told anyone.\n\nShe was certainly grateful for being her friend before which is only because you didn’t treat her with any antipathy. Still, she was afraid too.\n\nMiss Olga wasn’t though; she still just wanted you to be in a good home. You didn’t really care about that though.\n\nIf you ever really did.\n\n“Prospective parents are coming in today, everyone be on your best behavior! No fighting, no name calling, no nonsense!” Miss Olga exclaims.\n\nAll the children remain silent or say “Yes Miss Olga.”\n\nMiss Olga tells everyone to stay within the orphanage walls, and then as everyone is breaking up from the line up, Miss Olga pulls you aside.\n\n“As for you, I want YOU to make an effort today.” Miss Olga says.\n“I’m here.” You say.\n“Yes, you’re here. You didn’t sneak away to the park like you typically do, but you’ve also been here for several of these days and for whatever reason, nobody seems to want to adopt you. It’s like you’re actively driving them away.”\n“I’m not doing anything.”\n“Well you’re doing something.”\n“If you want me out of here so much, why not just give me to the first couple who comes in?”\n“It doesn’t work like that and you know it. I can’t just give you away like an object. I have to see if the prospective parents want you AND if you want to be with them. Maybe other places don’t care, but want to make good matches. You NEED to be more outgoing, not just sitting in a corner being anti-social.”\n\nMiss Olga exhales as if she’s really trying to make you understand.\n\n“Look, you’re a pretty girl who is intelligent enough to be given a better education than this place can provide when I even have the time. You’re also still young enough to really enjoy a proper childhood. You can’t have that if you’re stuck here.”\n“What about Chloe?”\n“Huh? What about her?”\n“She tries very hard to get adopted, but nobody picks her. She’s nice and smart.”\n“Yes, well it is an unfortunate situation for her. Nobody wants half-breed orc children, at least nobody human does and it isn’t like I exactly have orc parents coming in here. It’s not surprising she was given to me. I imagine she’ll be here until she’s legally an adult and then who knows? In any case, you need to worry about YOUR future and staying here until you’re an adult isn’t the best possible one for you. Will you at least try today?”\n\nYou don’t really reply, causing Miss Olga to just throw up her hands and walk off.\n\nPart of you does wonder why you’re not trying to get adopted. You don’t exactly like it here. There also have been a few adults that seemed okay. If you’d made the effort, you’re pretty sure you would have been adopted by now.\n\nMiss Olga does seem to want the best for you, but she doesn’t understand you though. If she did, she’d have you sent away like she did with Patty or worse.\n\nYou wonder if maybe part of you is sticking around because of Chloe. You’re the only friend she has and even if she is a little afraid of you now, you imagine she’d still miss you if you were gone.\n\nEventually you stop wondering about such things when you hear people entering the orphanage. You walk to the front room and see quite a few adults walking in. Mostly humans of course.\n\nOnce again, you make no effort to be friendly even if you aren’t actively hostile. Most of the couples look over at your way, but don’t approach. A few of them do approach, but soon walk away when you’re giving them one-word answers to questions.\n\nHowever, one man comes up to you with a smile on his face.\n\n“So, I’m guessing you’re not a fan of these things?” the man asks.\n\nYou don’t answer at all.\n\n“Don’t blame you. It’s never fun to have to act like a different person. Trust me, I’m a merchant and I have to do it all the time.”\n\nYou continue to not answer, but the man isn’t offended or driven away by your demeanor.\n\n“So, what do you do?”\n“Nothing.” You finally answer.\n“I find that hard to believe. Everyone does something. Working, playing, whatever it is, they’re doing something for some reason even if they aren’t doing it all the time. You don’t seem like the rest of your fellows here. They’re all eager to leave this place, while you seem to be content where you are, that suggests there must be some reason you’re not in a hurry to leave.”\n“I like the park.”\n“Hm. I imagine that is one of the few green areas in this city. Nature lover perhaps? You ever been outside Nuro’s walls? There’s a lot more to see. Beautiful things.”\n“Where’s your wife?”\n“My wife? What makes you think I’m married?”\n“Everyone who adopts is married.”\n“Is that a rule?”\n“It is here. Miss Olga doesn’t want perverts coming here.”\n\nYour accusation causes the man to laugh.\n\n“Trust me girl, there are plenty of couples that have ill intent as well. However, yes I am married, but my wife is currently at home. She’s been rather sick lately, but we had this appointment and insisted that I go alone and she trusts my judgment.”\n“Well she’s going to have to be here, if you actually want to adopt and Miss Olga will know if you just got some whore to pose as your wife.”\n“Wow. You really are a suspicious one. Still, being suspicious isn’t the worst thing in the world. Keeps one alive and alert I suppose. Can’t imagine it’s been easy growing up here. I used to live around here.”\n“You grew up in an orphanage?”\n“No, I had both my parents, though I might have been better off growing up in one given how they were. I did live a few blocks away though, down at the end of Ragpicker Lane.”\n“Miss Olga tells us not to go near that direction.”\n“Well she’s right. Not an area of the city I’d recommend, glad I made it out. So what about you?”\n“What about me what?”\n“Wouldn’t you like to leave here?”\n\nYou back away a bit from the man.\n\n“You seem awfully interested in me. There’s other kids here.” You say.\n“True, but they all seem to be preoccupied with other potential parents. Well except for that one standing against the wall. Poor kid, she can’t help she’s an orc.” The man remarks.\n“She’s only half orc.”\n“I stand corrected, but that more makes sense. Can’t imagine orcs give their unwanted children to orphanages when they could eat them instead.”\n“They do?”\n“Well, I suppose I’m just making assumptions. I probably shouldn’t. You can miss out on things if you make too many of them. Well I guess I won’t bother you any longer. It’s been nice speaking with you, you take care of yourself.”\n\nThe man turns around and heads back towards the crowd of adults and children. You’re a little more at ease, though you thought for sure he’d keep talking to you.\n\nYou think back again to what Miss Olga said about trying to get adopted and finally leaving this place. There’s a part of you that was a little intrigued by what the man had to say, even if you didn’t give him much time to say a lot.\n\nA fleeting thought of what it might be like to have a proper family enters your mind, but only for a moment. You leave the orphanage and go to the park. You want to try something.\n\nYou go to the usual secluded spot of the park and after looking around, you see a rabbit sitting and eating a few wildflowers.\n\nYou close you look around again and then stretch your hand out and focus…\n\nA jolt of energy comes from your finger. You don’t fall backwards this time. You’ve managed to control it better. You feel numbness in your hand, though it’s better than the pain you used to feel in it.\n\nYou look at the rabbit and see your aim has gotten better as well, since you’ve fried the furry creature. You don’t really like killing animals, but it’s the only way to practice.\n\nYou focus on the dead rabbit.\n\nAnd focus…\n\nThe dead rabbit starts to stir. It looks around and then at you, making sounds a rabbit wouldn’t normally make. Now comes the difficult part.\n\nYou immediately attempt to hold the dead rabbit in place through sheer force of will.\n\nIt runs toward you…\n\nAnd then stops.\n\nThen it wanders left and to the right. It looks at you again, growls, leaps at your feet before stopping completely again.\n\nYou back away, step to the side and feel very shaky. You lean up against a tree trying to gather your wits. Part of it is nerves, but what you’re doing is very exhausting. The concentration, the energy, everything is just very tiring.\n\nMeanwhile the rabbit look at you with dead eyes as if waiting for further commands. You’ve made some real progress today.\n\nThen you suddenly hear laughter approaching, it’s two older teenagers who are walking and kissing each other. They haven’t seen you or the zombie rabbit yet, but their presence catches you off guard.\n\nEnough so that you lose concentration and the rabbit ceases to stay put. Its attention is now not on you, it’s on the teenagers and it runs towards them.\n\nYou can’t stop it in time, in fact if you tried, you’d just out yourself and get into major trouble. The only thing you can think of to do is run off before they see you, which they don’t because they’re too busy screaming about a zombie rabbit viciously attacking them.\n\nWith the screams of teenagers behind you, you quickly make your way out of the park before anyone really notices you or city guards come running.\n\nPart of you is genuinely worried now. Will this be traced back to you? You remember Chloe talking about the type of magic you were messing with being against the rules. Maybe they’ll just think the rabbit is rabid.\n\nAll you want to do is hide and get as far as you can from the park. You don’t want to go back to the orphanage since you imagine the adoption day is still going on. Part of you doesn’t even want to be in the city right now.\n\nYou briefly think about leaving the city, but that’s just not possible. You have no idea of anything outside Nuro, let alone where to go or how you’d live. You just pick a direction and start walking without paying much attention.\n\nYou start thinking about all this magic you’ve been practicing and wondering if you should stop. Though, it’s not really all the magic, but one specific type of magic you’ve had a bit of a compulsion ever since…well since you discovered you had the abilities at all.\n\nYou can’t help it though, there’s just this desire within you. You’ve even been having more dreams lately. Dreams of darkness and death. You’d like to tell someone, but you know you can’t.\n\nYou can’t tell Miss Olga, you can only imagine her reaction and it wouldn’t be good. You can’t even tell Chloe, at least not everything that’s been going on with you. She’d be even more scared of you than she already is. They’re arguably the closest things you’ve ever known to family and you still hold them at a distance.\n\nThe thought goes through your head that while leaving the city isn’t really an option; maybe at least running away from the orphanage is in order. It’s obviously too confining for your personality.\n\nYou’d have to figure out where to stay and survive mostly by theft, but you think you could do it.\n\nAs the day grows darker while you struggle with your thoughts, you know you need to make a choice about what you’re going to do. If you’re going to leave or go back.\n",

But where to go?\n\nYou wonder if heading to the magic college might be a good idea as you’ve heard it’s big and there probably would be a place you could hide out. Not to mention it would certainly have material where you could learn more magic. Perhaps even something that could help you control it better.\n\nOf course it’s pretty late already and if you tried to get there right now, it would definitely be night. You still aren’t sure of the exact directions to get there let alone where to go when you get there. Getting lost in the city or on the campus wouldn’t be desirable.\n\nYour best bet would just be finding an abandoned building in your area and sacking out there at least for the night until you figured out something more long term. Not exactly ideal, but then again you’re going to need to learn how to rough it soon anyway.\n\nYou head towards the poorer part of the city where such places are easy to find. You’re a little concerned for your safety of course, so you’re looking all around expecting the worst.\n\nEventually passing by several bums, drunks, and other disreputable looking types, you eventually think you find a relatively secluded place. It’s a mostly boarded up house, but upon closer inspection, you see a small opening in the back of it that you can crawl into. You figure the worst thing you’re going to encounter is maybe rats or potentially other children that have discovered it as well.\n\nThere isn’t much light other than some holes in the roof, but the floor seems pretty solid thankfully. You walk about some of the rooms and find that it’s mostly empty with just a few pieces of broken furniture.\n\nYou see a bed though that while dusty, doesn’t look completely disgusting. You’re so tired from the day you’ve had and you flop down on it. You start to close your eyes still going over things and your situation in your mind. You’ve got so much to do tomorrow. It’s going to be difficult, but for now you need to sleep.\n\nYou close your eyes and suddenly you feel a force holding your limbs down. You immediately open your eyes and see a figure looming over you, but you can’t make out the face in the darkness.\n\n“Well, well, well. What do we have here? Another lost little lamb seeking shelter? Mmm, and such a pretty one as well. I’m going to have so much fun with you for a while. Don’t bother getting up, I’ll be joining you in bed shortly.”\n\nPanic and fear overtakes you as you try to scream out, but you can’t. This figure who obviously means to do you harm has magical powers much stronger than yourself. Never before have you felt so helpless and all you can do is hope all of this will go away and then everything goes black.\n\nYou look around and find yourself back in the present, whatever that means in a place like this.\n\nThankfully that wasn’t how your life went. Something about the predator seemed a bit familiar, though you’re pretty sure the encounter went a whole lot differently.\n\nAfter a bit of reflection on what just happened, you realize you’ll have to try again to reconnect later. When will that be? You never can tell.\n\nBut it’ll happen again. You’ll reunite with your beloved.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time.\n",
  "page 109": "Things went on like that for a while. You can’t remember all the details of course, but you remember how you became very helpful to Miss Olga.\n\nWhile you still practiced your magic, you weren’t running off to the park to do so as much anymore. You mostly practiced in quiet to a limited degree in your own room which you got when you got older.\n\nBy that time you were a teen and all of the children you originally grew up with had been adopted. New and younger children found themselves at the orphanage and you were playing a similar role as Miss Olga most of the time.\n\nYou performed your new tasks at the orphanage without much complaint. It wasn’t really that bad, the children feared you. You never actually did anything to them of course, but there was something about you that was scary to them. Even when Miss Olga would actively yelled at them, it was always you they seemed genuinely scared of.\n\nMiss Olga noticed this too…\n\n“Catalina, after you’re done, I want to see you.” Miss Olga says.\n“Okay.” You answer briefly before returning to the children you’re currently speaking to.\n\n“I don’t want a repeat of yesterday where a vase was broken. I don’t care if it was an accident. It better not happen again or else there will be consequences. You all understand?”\n“Yes Catalina.” The children say in unison.\n“Good. Now go play.”\n\nThe children waste no time in running from you as you turn to speak to Miss Olga in her room.\n\nYou look at her and she’s holding herself up with a walking stick. You know she’s been getting slower lately, but she’s also been starting to look less healthy. An extra cough here and there. Stopping to catch her breath more. Little things that are obviously a sign of bigger things.\n\nShe sits down and motions you to do likewise.\n\n“Catalina, you’ve been very helpful around here for a long time now. Very surprising considering how you used to have me tearing my hair out at times. Don’t think I don’t appreciate it.” She starts off saying.\n\nYou look at her in silence as she takes a deep breath before continuing.\n\n“However, I’ve also noticed a change in you over the years. I’m not talking about you just growing up either. No other way to put this, so I’ll just say it.”\n“You’re dying.” You utter.\n\nMiss Olga looks at you with an expression of surprise you’ve never seen before on her. She’s silent for a moment, but quickly regains her composure.\n\n“That actually isn’t what I was going to say…but that is related to what I want to talk to you about, which is, there is a darkness in you. Maybe it’s my fault that I didn’t notice it sooner, and obviously I haven’t seen you do anything that supports this, but I sense it. The children out there sense it. You give off an aura that isn’t just stand offish, it’s off putting. I’m not saying you’re a hellspawn, evil or even bad, but you scare people and I don’t know how you’re doing it. I can only guess there’s magic involved though.”\n\nYou briefly reposition in your seat, which tells Miss Olga what she correctly guessed long ago.\n\n“Now I suppose I could ask you if you have magical abilities and how long you’ve had them, but I’m not sure what good that would do. I will say that if I’m correct in believing that you probably had them for years, I REALLY wish you had come to me sooner about it, because I would have found a suitable family for you immediately.”\n“You’re my family.” You say.\n\nOnce again you catch Miss Olga a bit off guard.\n\n“Cat…I’m…” Miss Olga starts to say before a bout of coughing followed by another deep breath follows before she speaks again.\n\n“Catalina we’re not family. I’m just a caretaker until you’re able to take care of yourself. Now normally that would still be at least four more years away, but you’re obviously able to take care of yourself. One could even say, you’ve long been able to take care of yourself…”\n“Wait…you’re kicking me out?” you ask since now you’re the one that’s surprised.\n“I’d rather not, trust me. I’d rather find you parents that could guide your magic abilities better, but I don’t have time and I don’t have the energy anymore. By the end of this month, this place will be taken over by a new caretaker and will be run by the city of Nuro rather than independently like I was running it.”\n“But, what’re you going to do?”\n“Well as you so astutely assessed, I’m going to die. Not right away, but I give myself a year perhaps. I’m going to use what remains of the fortune my late husband left me long ago to live as comfortably as possible. I like to think I did as much good as I could with that bastard’s money, but now at this late stage, I think I’m allowed to enjoy what little remains of my life.”\n\nYou aren’t sure of how to respond, so Miss Olga just continues.\n\n“Now that all being said, I’m not kicking you out. You could even stay and take your chances with the new regime, but I have a strong feeling that won’t go well. I just know that this is no place for you any longer. The Nuro appointed caretaker I guarantee is not going to run things like I did and you would definitely have less freedom than I allowed. In short, it won’t be home to you any longer. So open that drawer over there, you’ll find a purse of coin. Should be enough in there to last you a couple months.”\n\nYou slowly go over to the drawer and take the purse. You think back to how you stole money out of it once and how odd it is to be taking it with permission.\n\nYou look down at the purse in your hands and wave of anxiety washes over you.\n\n“Hm. Never seen you sad. Not even when Chloe left. I didn’t think you had it in you. You’re just full of surprised today. Perhaps I spoke too harshly about you having darkness in you. That’s my own dislike of magic I suppose. It’s not your fault you have unnatural talents. I at least know you’ll be able to survive thanks to them.”\n\nMiss Olga gets back up with some effort and walks over to you. She puts a hand on your shoulder.\n\n“Just…be good. Okay?”\n\nYou almost want to hug her, but you resist. There’s no reason. She told you, that you weren’t family. You suppose she’s right. It’ll make things easier if you just leave.\n\nYou turn around and walk out her room and eventually out the door. You look back at the orphanage one last time and quicken your pace as your eyes start to water.\n\nEventually you find an empty alleyway and break down crying. Part of you doesn’t even know why exactly. Or you know why, but you don’t understand why it hurts more than it should.\n\nYou guess you cared more than you admitted, even to yourself. The orphanage wasn’t much but it was the only home you ever knew. Miss Olga was the only parental figure you ever knew. Now you have nothing.\n\nNothing except some coin to support yourself for a while and your magic, which you haven’t been practicing on a steady basis.\n\nAs you’re trying to pull yourself together and ponder your future, you suddenly hear an unfriendly voice.\n\n“Well, well, well, what have we here? You out here by yourself little girl? You lost? That why you’re crying? Well dry those tears, because we can help…of course like anything, it’ll cost.”\n\nYou look and see five men. Well actually just one older man and four boys probably just a few years older than you, but in any case, they obviously don’t mean you any well.\n\nYou start to back away to run, but you suddenly feel a pull when the leader gestures with one of his hands, like a force is drawing you closer. You resist, but in the process you lose your purse, which flies towards him and falls in front of him, spilling all the contents out.\n\n“Hey, what’s this then? This is a lot of coin for a little girl like you. You make all this picking pockets? Or you got some other skills that people pay a lot for?” the leader says with a grin.\n\nGiven what he’s able to do, the leader is a magic user. You don’t know how powerful of one though.\n\n“Look you have the coin, I’ll just leave your territory.” You say and start to back away again.\n“Not so fast girlie. While this coin might be enough to divide four ways, There’s five of us and since I’m most generous to my boys, that means they’ll be getting it. So the way I see it, you still need to pay me. And since you have no coin left, you’ll have to provide in other ways.” The leader says.\n“Boss, she looks about fourteen, I don’t think…” one of the members of his group starts to say before he’s pushed with an unseen force against a wall.\n\n“Obviously you don’t think, because you wouldn’t be interrupting me right now boy!” the leader shouts before turning back to you.\n\n“Now we can do this the easy way or the hard way, girlie. The choice is yours.”\n\nIt’s funny that during the years you were sneaking away to the park or even other parts of the surrounding area, you never once encountered some predator out to assault you. Now of all days, you’re getting a gang of them.\n\nYou’re in no mood for this and you already tried to resolve this without any further conflict. You certainly start feeling something well up inside you. You aren’t sure if it’s that darkness Miss Olga was talking about, but it’s not going to be good for these assholes.\n\n“Well I guess the hard way then.” You say.\n“Heh, I was hoping you’d say that.”\n\nThe leader gestures and you feel yourself being pulled towards him. When you’re close enough, you raise your own hands and unleash a blast of lightning to his face.\n\nHe falls to the ground and now released from his telekinetic pull, you proceed to zap another in the chest immediately.\n\n“SHIT! She’s got spells too! Run!” one of them shouts.\n\nThe remaining two standing run, but you wave your hand and unleash a small flame wave, which manages to catch not only them on fire, but some of the trash nearby as well. They continue running and screaming while on fire.\n\nYou walk closer to the leader and see he’s dead with the flesh on his face mostly burned off or at least blackened to a smoking crisp. Meanwhile the one he had previously thrown against the wall has recovered.\n\n“Oh fuck! Please! Let me go! I tried to stop Jaxon! Look, you killed him! He’s dead! Just let me go!” he exclaims.\n\nYou could. You even sense the fear and sincerity of his words.\n\nThe urge though to revel in your power is VERY tempting.\n",
  "page 54": "“Wait. What the fuck am I thinking about? Francis had terrible ideas hence the reason why all this is happening in the first place. Not sure why I’m getting the blame, but then Belina, you always were jealous of me.”\n\nYou step back and unleash flames from your hands, setting Belina’s corpse on fire. It continues to move towards you a few steps before succumbing to the flames which weaken its structure enough that collapses into a pile of burning flesh.\n\nWith the immediate problem solved you refocus your mind back your previous task.\n\n“A new world. A fresh start. Yes, that is perhaps what I need now. Doesn’t matter if I have to start over, I’ll succeed. Shit, might even be better if I don’t have most of the current fools impeding my progress as usual.”\n\nSpeaking of fools, several of your “attentive” guards have finally showed up after hearing the noises coming from the meeting room. They go on about how they came quickly and ask if you’re all right. You naturally dismiss their phony concerns and tell some of them to clean up the burning mess on the floor while the rest of them accompany you to the summoning chamber. You have demons to trap.\n\nHours pass and you manage to trap eight more even if it took about fifteen to actually summon. At least you didn’t lose anyone today, not that you care, but more because then you would have had to expend even more energy killing the reanimated corpses.\n\nYou’re exhausted though as the stress of the day has really gotten to you. You can’t even be bothered to have some idiot lackey service you. You’re going to just get some sleep. It’s been awhile anyway, you’ve probably been up for a couple days.\n\nOther than the recent incident with Belina, your area has been relatively free of undead activity this day, so hopefully the sentries are able to handle any potential trouble while you attempt to rest.\n\nYou get to your bed and nearly fall asleep immediately. Time passes until you hear a voice…\n\n“Semra…Semra…my svelk beauty…are you awake?”\n\nYou open your eyes and see Francis lying next to you. He gently starts to caress your shoulder.\n\n“Oh good. It’s just an incubus. I thought for a moment Marzost had snuck in here and rolled in sulfur to improve his scent.” You say.\n“Incubus? No my dear, I’m the answer to all your desires.” Francis says moving his hand lower to one of your breasts.\n“I know damn well you’re not Francis, not to mention there is no way Francis would be acting the way you are now.”\n“If I’m not Francis as you say, and in indeed an incubus. Why are you allowing me to touch you in such a manner?”\n“Didn’t say I didn’t mind the illusion. I’m guessing you must have slipped in during one of the summonings. Smart of you to stay hidden, though sort of wondering how you did it. I’ve been very thorough with setting up proper protections and incubi aren’t known to be very powerful in breaking through such spells. You’re inferior to your female counterparts, as is usually the case with males of any race.”\n“And as I’ve said, I’m not an incubus.”\n\nFrancis (Or the image of him) gets up a bit and transforms into a very traditional looking red skinned demon. Not an incubus, but certainly nothing outwardly extraordinary about him, though obviously if he’s here, he has some power. In your fatigued state, you’re not even sure you’d be able to take him without some major effort. You decide to play it civil for now.\n\n“Hm, I don’t remember summoning any demon lords or princes. I was very careful about sticking to low level fodder of your kind.” You say.\n“Oh you didn’t. I’m no lord or prince or anything like that. Just an infernal who noticed some of my fellows being ripped from home and caught a ride as it were. Might not have noticed at all had you not been summoning so many within such a short period of time and in the careful way you were doing it. Usually with the numbers you were doing, wizardly types just open a gate for their armies or whatever and be done with it.” The demon responds.\n“Well next time I’ll try to be more reckless. So if we’re going to talk, what do I address you as then if you’re not demon royalty?”\n“Oh, just call me Big Red or Red. Everyone else does.”\n“Big Red?” you say and look him up and down somewhat baffled by the name.\n“Long story and not important.”\n\nThe demon now gets off the bed completely and stands beside it to address you. You can now feel his presence in your head, though he’s not being very invasive…yet.\n\n“Getting back to the matter at hand, I can’t help but notice your world is doomed. Is that why you’re summoning us? You don’t actually expect an army of infernals to help you fight what’s coming do you? This world is far too gone for that now.” He says.\n“And you know this how?” you ask.\n“Oh I’ve seen this before. In fact I saw this the first time it happened. Was a bit more fascinating at the time. Now it’s just something to avoid when possible, well normally it is anyway…you have a very interesting mind.”\n“Of course I do. So were planning on raping my mind instead of my body?”\n“Hadn’t planned on it and from what I can tell at a brief glance, you’d probably find some pleasure in such a thing, but I’d prefer a more consensual approach. Apparently you’re attempting to leave this world and you’re hoping to do something with trapped infernals for this process?”\n\nSince there’s no point in keeping secrets from Big Red who currently has the upper hand, you explain what you’re trying to do. He looks a bit thoughtful for a moment and then responds.\n\n“Well it’s certainly been tried before in your situation, but unfortunately once a world is marked like this, it’s very difficult to leave even through portals like you’re attempting to open. A barrier of sorts is usually put up to prevent such escape attempts. Even if successful, the God of Death or whatever he calls himself, doesn’t like loose ends and mortals escaping during a reaping tends to just doom whatever world they fled to.”\n“Wait. What?”\n“Oh yes. For example there was a powerful magic reptilian race called the Milosian who also attempted immortality and turn themselves into gods. Didn’t work of course and only brought the doom to their world. They too resisted in the usual ways, even summoning us infernals and making pacts in the hopes of saving themselves. None of it worked. We knew that of course, but a soul is a soul right? In any case several of them realized that escape was the only way to avoid the reaping so they managed to open a portal to a completely different world. A fairly peaceful one even. Hundreds of Milosians who were still alive entered the portal believing they were safe.”\n“They weren’t of course.”\n“No, the portal didn’t close behind them despite even attempts to close it, but they were marked and they would not escape death. Didn’t take long before the very world they escaped to started suffering the same fate. Not that it deserved having all life extinguished on it, but there’s usually no way to avoid things like these and deserves got nothing to do with it.”\n“And so that world died as well?”\n“Yes. Everything on it. The Death God isn’t fond of escape attempts from a reaping, especially massive ones like the Milosians tried and he just becomes more focused on the task. Besides, mortals all eventually die anyway so I imagine it’s just getting ahead in the workload to him.”\n“Shit.”\n\nYou’re now wide-awake and concerned about your situation even more than you were before. You’re also angry. You have a solution to ensure your survival and now you’re hearing that it won’t even work.\n\nYou get up out of bed cursing and even throwing an old valuable svelk vase against the wall. You then look over at Big Red who is now sitting on the edge of your bed just watching you.\n\nThere IS still a way out of this. You have some knowledge of the demonic mind and this one obviously wouldn’t have told you about any of this if he wasn’t going to offer you a way out. You can guess what the price is going to be though.\n\nYou compose yourself and address Big Red.\n\n“So…how DO I escape?” you ask.\n“What makes you think you can?” Big Red says.\n“Because you wouldn’t be bothering to stick around if there wasn’t a loophole.”\n“I could just be enjoying taunting you.”\n“You could and it would be quite in character for a demon, but I don’t sense that you’d bother with something so petty or at least not when you could get something more out of it.”\n“Quite astute. You are definitely one of the better examples of your kind. Very well let’s get to the good part. Yes, there IS a way you can escape without being detected or at least in such a way that you won’t be immediately followed. You could go through my home which is the Infernal Realm.”\n“Great plan, escape death only to end up in hell. Not real keen on getting ass raped by demons forever.”\n“Oh trust me, perpetual anal violation would be the kindest thing that would happen to you. However, it need not be that way. I could be persuaded to give you safe passage. Basically, you’d enter the Infernal Realm and from there I’ll have a gate open to another world similar to yours. Your trail as it were would be erased, and you’d be free to start your new life without being hunted.”\n“And let me guess, you want my soul in return.”\n“Well safe passage through the Infernal Realm is pretty expensive. I’m going to need more than just yours. Let’s see, you’ve trapped about twenty of my infernal comrades so far. I’d say about a hundred of yours plus yourself should cover it.”\n“A hundred?”\n“What’s the problem? Don’t tell me you’re actually concerned for your fellow svelk.”\n“It’s not that, it’s just a hell of a lot when I need all the fodder I can get not to mention sacrificing a hundred svelk isn’t going to improve the already tenuous relationship I have with my fellow svelk. Last thing I need is a full on revolt. Can’t I make other offerings instead, like humans or dero? I could at least justify that more to my people and have an easier time gathering them. A soul is a soul right?”\n\nBig Red taps his chin with a clawed finger for a moment.\n\n“Well under normal circumstances, you’d be right, a soul is a soul, but again these aren’t normal circumstances. Human souls are so damn common that a hundred of them are of practically no great value. Not interested in human souls at this time, not to mention most of them will probably be ending up in the Infernal Realm after the reaping anyway. So will most your race too, but your race’s souls on other hand have certain superior quality about them that I would personally like first dibs on. Your soul in particular is quite intoxicating. Yes, you have been a very naughty girl. I believe even a few infernals could learn something from you. I’m not familiar with these dero, but I suppose I could check them out, I’ll get back to you on that, but as it stands I want a hundred svelk souls and yours. Also going to need your signature in blood to ensure that deal.”\n“Yeah about that, can’t I just give you two hundred instead?”\n\nBig Red chuckles.\n\n“Well that didn’t take long.. So you propose to offer two hundred for your life then? Why not a thousand?” Big Red asks.\n“A thousand?” you respond.\n“None of your blood needed for that deal of course. If it’s too risky, then you know the old price. I’ll give you some time to think about it, in the meantime you better get started right away since a hundred of your fellows will be mine either way assuming you still want safe passage through my home.”\n“And this is the only option you offer?”\n“Well you could still take your chances with your plan, but I guarantee it won’t work.”\n\nNot much of a choice.\n\nA thousand svelk souls is a tall order. It’s not just a simple matter of having a thousand svelk killed. You’re going to have to go through a similar ritual process of how you’re currently trapping the demons. Granted less complex and less immediate danger, but doing something like this on a grand scale is eventually going to draw more ire from the svelk population which is already showing signs of splintering apart thanks to the relentless undead attacks, as well as your previous arrangement with dero.\n\nOf course being a demon, everything he says could very well be an outright lie and this could all be an excuse to try to gather souls (specifically yours) while he’s here. The problem is demons tend to mix the truth with their lies. Still, you’re just as equally prone to dismiss Big Red altogether. Making deals with demons usually never ends well. The fall of the old Svelk Empire is proof of that.\n\nAlong with other things more personal.\n",
  "page 108": "As you continue to piece together your life, you don’t remember ever interacting with Chloe again.\n\nOh sure there was a promise that she would write letters to you and even visit, but that never really happened. Such promises were more of a result of Chloe’s gratitude for being the only person nice to her in the orphanage even if she did become a little afraid of you in later years. Maybe even fear played a role in her promises; she certainly didn’t want to get on your bad side.\n\nStill, you don’t think she intentionally lied to you. People drift apart all the time and it’s just as well she left when she did. You were already becoming much more.\n\nYou do remember getting ONE letter from her however. It wasn’t that long after she left the orphanage.\n\n“Catalina, I have something for you.” Miss Olga says, waving you over.\n\nYou stop washing dishes, dry your hands and go over to Miss Olga who hands you a letter. You look at it and in poor hand writing you see Chloe’s name on it.\n\n“You can take a break, I’ll finish up. You read your letter.” Miss Olga says.\n\nYou nod and go to your bed to read it, fortunately everyone seems to be out of the sleeping area giving you a little privacy.\n\nIt’s sometimes hard to make out Chloe’s handwriting since she never did have the best and her spelling was pretty bad as well, but it’s decipherable.\n\nCatalina,\n\nI hope your doing well. i just wanted to say im sorry for not visiting or riting sooner but things have been crazy round here. My new mom and dad are very nice to me, but she sick a lot so i do a lot of stuff like helping my new dad with his business. He sells lots of things like clothes, furniture and stuff.\n\nThis is why we are leaving Nuro and going to some city called Edat. Not sure where that is, but i guess its far away. He said bizness will be better there.\n\nI wanted to come to the orfanage to say goodbye in person but dad said we would not have time. i just wanted to say again im glad that you were my freind when nobody else wuz.\n\nStill you started getting scary. i still have never told anyone about your gift and i hope you tell miss olga or someone who can help you one day becuz im scared you might acidently hert yourself or sumone else. Maybe miss olga could find magical parents for you.\n\nAnyway i have to leeve soon. I miss you and yull always be my freind.\n\nChloe\n\np.s. I will rite again to you when i can. I think my riting has gotten better!\n\n\nYou scan over the letter a couple times and don’t feel much of anything. There is a part of you that is a little sad, but not enough to really have an emotional outburst like crying. It’s a loss, but not one that can’t be overcome.\n\nIn fact after you finish looking over for the fifth time, you crumple up the letter and throw it in a trashcan.\n\nYou then head to the park since Miss Olga did say she was giving you a break. You practice you magic which you haven’t been doing as frequently due to all the busy work Miss Olga’s given you.\n\nThe memory begins to get fuzzy again as you drift back into your “present”, but you do remember that Chloe never wrote you again. You never saw her again. You don’t know what happened to her.\n\nWell that isn’t true. You do know what happened. She died.\n\nJust like everyone else did on that world.\n",
  "page 57": "There is no way in hell you’re making any sort of deal with a fucking demon. As smart as you believe yourself to be, they are always one step ahead with some sort of trick. Especially if they’re proposing the deal in the first place.\n\nAnd this Big Red seems particularly crafty, he’s proposing something he knows is impossible so you’ll eventually have to submit to him.\n\nYou’d rather take your chances with the dero. At least you can warn Marzost about the situation and maybe you can come up with something.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t think I’ll be taking any sort of deal with you. I’ll figure something out, I always do.” You say.\n“I see. Well I am disappointed to not get first dibs on your soul. In any case I suppose I’ll take my leave of you for now. Perhaps you’ll be in a more accommodating mood at that time.” Big Red replies.\n“Don’t count on it.”\n“I suppose we’ll see. Oh I suppose I should tell you that imprisoning my fellow infernals will have to cease. The Infernal Realm takes a dim view of mortals chaining its citizens up like slaves.”\n“You’re joking. Don’t you lot enslave each other all the fucking time?”\n“And that’s just it, YOU my dear are NOT an infernal. To be enslaved by a mortal is so undignified, especially when you aren’t even giving them a sporting chance to get out of it. You’re just intending them to use them as an energy source. No, I’m afraid your actions must stop as of right now…unless…”\n“Unless what? I give you my soul?”\n“Well that would be nice, but I already know your answer to that. What I was going to suggest is an act of goodwill on your part. You see, I know a few of those infernals you currently have locked up in those crystals. I’d like to take them back with me.”\n“Oh. Okay…well the crystals are over in that chest over there. Check through them to find your friends I guess.”\n“I didn’t say they were my friends. Just said I knew them. Also there are so many crystals to search through, so I’ll just be taking ALL of them. I assume that’s fine with you as you can just capture more.”\n\nBig Red looks at you, though now he seems a little more menacing with his stare. Something about it causes a slight shiver in your body. There’s definitely more to him than meets your eyes. You feel like it’s better to just let him have the crystals as his bribe.\n\n“Okay, they’re yours.” You say.\n“That’s a good compliant girl.” Big Red replies.\n\nBig Red walks over and grabs the chest full of crystals under one arm then walks over to you. You defensively move back, though he puts up a hand as if to imply he means you no harm.\n\n“Don’t worry. I’m not going to attack you. Just going to say that I might be lingering around so if you change your mind just call.”\n\nBig Red then closes his eyes and sniffs the air near you before addressing you again.\n“Hmmm…damn your soul is almost making me forget that I’m a gentleman. I shall take my leave.” He says and then disappears before your eyes.\n\nWhile it’s very difficult to make you feel uncomfortable, Big Red certainly managed to accomplish it. You’re just glad he was one of those demons that seemed to like toying with his potential victims because you got the impression he would have been a tougher fight than he let on.\n\nYou’re also certain that not making any sort of deal with him was the correct choice. Unfortunately he set you back quite a bit. You’ll have to not only get more crystals from the dero, but you’ll have recapture demons all over again.\n\nAt this point, you’re probably going to have to do this demon summoning business in the dero lair. It’ll be more taxing and generally unpleasant, but it should cut down on the potential for a demon like Big Red to manage to sneak in.\n\nMarzost will probably be happy to accommodate you so that aspect shouldn’t be a problem. Hopefully he keeps his drooling to a minimum and doesn’t try to touch you again though.\n\nIn a few days you go to meet with the dero and speak with Marzost about the situation. He’s of course disappointed to hear that you lost progress, but as predicted he’s more than willing to let you proceed with doing the demon capturing with dero supervision.\n\n“Don’t worry Mistress, I will have some of our best warriors to standby when you perform your work.” Marzost says.\n“Glad to hear it, but I’ll want to have some of my own people here as well.”\n“Of course. I’m sure we’ll get back on track fairly quickly. I would like to propose something though.”\n“Oh? And before you do Marzost, I want you to think very carefully about if this proposal would involve something unseemly.”\n“Heh, no nothing like that. I was merely going to suggest that you stay here rather than going back to your fortress.”\n“So it IS something unseemly.”\n“No, not at all. I know this is going to be more taxing on you, but we have even less time than we did before. You’re going to need to take intervals to rest and then get back to it immediately. I just meant it would all go quicker if you stayed here. You obviously don’t need to stay in the actual Dero settlement; you could stay in the svelk outpost above us.”\n“Hm, something to consider I suppose. Since you’re so full of ideas, I might as well ask your opinion on Big Red’s statement that when we open this portal, we won’t be able to close it and we’ll just be prolonging the inevitable.”\n“Oh that. Well, he’s a demon, so I would guess he was just lying in order to try to get you to agree to sign a contract for your soul.”\n“Yeah, that was my guess too, still though he could be telling the truth so is there something we can potentially do to prevent it?”\n“I mean you’re the powerful sorceress, I would imagine if you wouldn’t be able to do it, nothing we could do would help either.”\n“Don’t you lot have sort of weird technology or something that could do something? You lot are supposed to be great inventors and all.”\n“Heh, well I suppose it couldn’t hurt to try to look into something like that, but it’s not like we’ve got a lot of the big brains here to research shit like that anymore or even the time. I can’t promise we’ll solve that potential issue before we open up the portal. I suppose that if this Big Red is telling the truth, we’ll just have to resolve it later. At the very least, getting off this world will buy us more time.”\n“True. One problem at a time I guess.”\n“So what about the other thing I mentioned?”\n“What thing?”\n“You staying here.”\n“Oh right. Your proposal.”\n\nMarzost looks at you expectantly.\n",
  "page 56": "Big Red is obviously one of those demons that prefers the art of the deal rather than doing something obvious like ripping your head off. So he’s probably got the idea to set you up for a major fall so it’ll ultimately be YOUR fault if you fuck up.\n\nMaking deals with demons is always dangerous, however it is known that they always honor them and if you happen to be clever enough (Or the demon isn’t particularly bright) you can be assured to come out ahead.\n\nAnd since you’ve never been one to play it safe, you choose to make the deal, but you’re not going in half assed about this.\n\n“Okay Big Red, I’m open to your deal, but I’m not committing to anything right now at all. You understand?”\n“Well at least you’re keeping an open mind. Very well I suppose I’ll check up on you at a later time and see how far along you are and we can better solidify our agreement. As I said, I’ll also investigate these dero you mentioned. Perhaps if their souls are as inviting as your people’s then I will accept them as well. I leave you to it.”\n\nBig Red seems as if he’s about to leave, but then lifts a hand with his index finger pointed up and addresses you.\n\n“One more thing. While I understand we have no commitment on this potential deal, I am going to have to ask that you to hand over my fellow trapped infernals as an act of goodwill, just so I at least know that you’re seriously considering my offer.”\n“Are you believing that I may change my mind and go with the original plan?”\n“As I said, just a measure of goodwill that you’re dedicated.”\n“You do realize I can just get more crystals and trap more of them again right?”\n“Yes, but that will take time and obviously cut into what time you need for OUR plan. That’s time you don’t really have as death draws closer. You also don’t have the energy to waste on all the magic you’d be performing, on top of attempting to wrangle my infernal fellows.”\n\nYou’re not convincing him out of this one. You’re tempted to cancel this whole agreement, but you’ve already come this far. You’re going to have to be very careful when the time comes to actually make a deal.\n\n“Very well, the demon trapped crystals are actually in a chest over there.” You say.\n“Hm, yes I sensed they were close by, very brave to have them so close by where you sleep.” Big Red says walking over to the chest and opening it.\n“Better that I’m close by to handle a situation.”\n“Well no need for that concern anymore. Yes, these will definitely come in handy. Nothing like having someone indebted to you completely and now I have twenty more of them. Oh, I can already hear how much they don’t like their new situation. Heh, I even know a few of these infernals. This arrangement of ours is already starting out well. See you soon.”\n\nBig Red takes the entire chest and then disappears.\n\nWell no time to lose, you’ve got preparations to make and you’re going to need all the help you can in rounding up folks. You’ve got to spin this one a bit. You figure approaching Gikil about this first is the better approach. The fool’s military mind is easier to manipulate and he genuinely has an amount of respect and obedience in those under his command.\n\nYou have Gikil summoned and in a couple days he arrives. He approaches and kneels in respect before you.\n\n“You may rise general.” You say.\n“Mistress, I trust you called me for an update on the battle front?” he asks after standing up.\n“Hm, yes I will be needing that too, but the main reason I called you was for a matter of more importance and one I need your assistance on.”\n“You have it of course Mistress.”\n“Good, now give me a report on Dokkrus’ current status. Don’t hold back the truth.”\n\nGikil immediately goes into his report and predictably explains that the situation continues to get worse. Already sections of Dokkrus are starting to wither as the land itself is dying. He says the undead are starting to appear in the incorporeal variety a lot more frequently which is concerning since the average person doesn’t at least have the right type of weaponry to hurt them. He says orders have been given to melt silver valuables down and have them forged into weapons.\n\nSeveral small communities have fallen completely and refugees have been seeking protection within the few strongholds and fortresses that exist. He mentions that order is still being maintained, just barely though and that’s only because the undead wandering the land are so much worse.\n\n“Of course this fortress as you know has been stable. No doubt due to your influence.”\n“No doubt. Thank you for the report, I’ll have some detailed questions about some of the struggling hubs of svelk civilization in a moment. Right now, let me get to the point of why I want to speak to you.\n\nYou explain that you have recently learned that the dero plan has been discovered will fail and that Marzost is just resting everything on a delusional hope since he’s now said it’s going to require at least two hundred trapped demons to power the archway and you’re not risking or wasting anymore time given how dire the situation grows.\n\nYou say you’ve been seeking other potential avenues of escape and mention your discussion with Big Red though you change some of the facts of course.\n\nYour mention of the arrangement to sacrifice a thousand svelk though does make Gikil’s eyes widen a bit. You don’t even mention the “lesser” deal that was offered as you don’t want Gikil to get any ideas and you want him to be focused on the task that doesn’t involve losing your own soul.\n\nHe doesn’t say anything and just stands there as if to take all this in.\n\n“Well? Can I count on your assistance?” you ask.\n\nYou figure it won’t hurt to resort to the old tried and true bait by getting a little physically closer and touching Gikil on the shoulder as if to imply potential deeper intimacy. Your actions cause him to look, but he doesn’t touch you in return. He obviously understands to not overstep despite your actions.\n\nGood.\n\n“You can Mistress. Obviously in a dire time like this, extreme measures must be taken. I do have some questions though.” Gikil answers.\n“I figured as much, we can hammer out a plan together. I want us to work closely on this task to ensure a successful outcome. You’re about the only competent person I can rely on anymore.”\n“I’m honored you believe so, I must ask though what is to be done with Drunni? You know he may argue against this plan.”\n“He’d probably bitch and moan, but ultimately if his own survival is ensured, then he’d go along with it. However, you’re right, he could be too much of a problem. He’ll be the first. Honestly probably should have gotten rid of him a long time ago.”\n\nGikil’s face displays a brief smile when you say that.\n\nYou and Gikil eventually sit down to plan the initial stages of this grim business. He mentions that the strongholds rather than the fortresses would be better to select for these mass sacrifices since there are less valuable svelk in those areas and are most likely going to fall to the undead first anyway. Their deaths might as well be useful.\n\nHe mentions that he can gather up a sizable company of loyal and capable soldiers to carry out this task without explaining too much. The problem of course is it will take away from the fight against the undead which will no doubt result it more death (which in turn will result in more undead) but that’s just how it’s going to have to be because escaping this place is a lot more important.\n\nGikil also asks you about trapping the svelk souls. You explain that trapping mortal souls (Even those of svelk) shouldn’t need a whole crystal and you can probably shove several into one. You mention the time when you had to obliterate gnome souls for the Emperor and you had many of them stuffed into containers.\n\n“Are your remaining thirty going to be enough for a thousand souls though?” Gikil asks.\n“Probably not. I should be able to fit quite a few souls into them though. I suppose I could make some soul jars like I did for the Emperor and shove the rest in them, but that was time consuming on its own. Would probably be easier to get more crystals from the dero, but that would undoubtedly raise suspicion and tip our hand on what we’re actually doing.” You say.\n“And what of our arrangement with them? They’re probably going to start asking for progress on the demon trapping and I doubt if they’ll just hand over more crystals. If it would save time in the long run, I propose wiping them out once and for all and taking what crystals they have for our purposes.”\n“Certainly an option, though given the task you have of rounding up a thousand sacrifices, I’d rather not have to waste more manpower than necessary on yet another faction to fight.\n“We can easily wipe them out.”\n“And that sort of over confidence is why the dero still wouldn’t be pushovers despite their reduced numbers. We’re not wasting valuable troops on the dero for crystals at this time. The dero haven’t even kept up with progress on the original plan so it’s probably best to just keep them in the dark for now so we still get their assistance with the undead.”\n“But what if they discover what we’re really doing?”\n“Even if the dero find out what we’re really doing, they won’t launch an assault and will probably just shut down all contact. At worst their volunteers above ground will attack, but they’re so few in number that won’t matter.\n\nYou tell Gikil to go fetch Drunni from whatever he’s currently doing and anyone of importance that may be allied with him and have them all imprisoned. You then tell him after he’s done with that task, to make preparations to clear out one of the smaller svelk communities. You also remind him to that you need living sacrifices so to keep the killing to a minimum.\n\nIn the meantime you prepare the summoning chamber for an entrapment of a completely different kind. This sacrificial business is going to take awhile, but then Francis managed a similar task when he brought death into the world within only days. Of course what he did was different, he had an utterly loyal army and he had the advantage of already having his sacrifices lined up. You’re going to have to wait to get yours at intervals from a group who’s loyalty is suspect.\n\nStill, you’re actually looking forward to your first sacrifices…\n",
  "page 59": "As much of a pain in the ass it’ll be to travel back and forth, you’re reluctant to actually stay close to the dero, especially with Marzost around probably gawking at you the whole time.\n\nYou need to stay on top of the day-to-day operation of things too, since you can’t trust Gikil or especially Drunni to actually be competent enough.\n\nYou turn down Marzost’s proposal. He looks disappointed, but says that you should still keep it in mind.\n\nIn the meantime, you’re here now so you get started with the long process of summoning and capturing demons.\n\nTwo months pass…\n\nYou’re exhausted.\n\nThe process has been going a lot slower than you hoped. You’ve only managed to capture three of the damn things and summoned a lot more that had to be put down.\n\nOne of the main problems besides the magic nullifying rocks all over the place making this process harder is apparently you’re actively getting “pull back” from the other side. Several of the demons you’ve summoned have mentioned about how they all know what you’ve been doing and steps have been made to prevent it.\n\nWhile none have mentioned his name specifically, you can guess that Big Red has had something to do with all this.\n\nYou’re also wasting a lot of time with travel. Granted you’ve teleporting yourself makes it quicker, but it just drains you even more from your task. Not to mention you can’t just teleport in and out of the dero community. The magic nullifying rocks prevent that, so you still partly have to travel the traditional way. By the time you’re even there, you’re already tired and when you’re attempting to go home, you barely have the energy.\n\nThe dero have been giving you shit. Well specifically the dero females. Almost anytime you stumble into one of those mini-shebeasts they are full of insults and disrespect. More than a few times, Marzost has had to step in to prevent something more violent from happening.\n\nThe only bright spot is that your own people have been behaving themselves for the most part. Undead are of course always a problem and the continent turning more to shit, but order has at least been maintained.\n\nUnfortunately that doesn’t ensure complete safety, especially when you’re running yourself ragged.\n\nOne night after a long grueling day of summoning, you’re making your way back to your fortress. You don’t have the standard escort with you since a particularly vicious demon that ran amok killed them all. Even the dero struggled to bring it down and you were mildly wounded in the struggle.\n\nMarzost insisted that you stay if only long enough to get some rest and heal up, but you were in such a foul mood that you immediately snapped at him and left without even gathering up other svelk at the outpost to accompany you.\n\nAs you travel alone angry, tired and wounded, you mind doesn’t focus on your surroundings like it should and you soon find yourself ambushed by a group of wraiths roaming around. Reports of more powerful undead becoming more frequent wasn’t unknown, but tonight was definitely not the night you wanted to stumble on them.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you probably could have handled the group by yourself. Or even if you were in your present fatigued condition, if you had others with you, you probably could at least sacrifice them as a distraction while you got away.\n\nBut there will be no such tactic this time.\n\nYou do fairly well against the horrors, but all it takes is one to sneak up and lay those ghostly hands upon you and you instantly feel your life drain. If you felt weak before, you really feel that way as you see your hands age before your eyes and it doesn’t take long before another wraith is on you and you soon become a withered corpse with everything drained out of it.\n\nIf you could, you’d go back in time and kick your own ass.\n\nWasn’t so much the how you died that was undignified, but why you did because of your own bad planning.\n\nOf course the how or even the why you died doesn’t matter at all anymore because you’re dead. And the afterlife you went to was even more unforgiving of your poor life choices.\n",
  "page 58": "Making a trek back and forth from your fortress to here day in day out is going to be a pain in the ass especially if you have to face the occasional undead attack along the way.\n\nYou could just have a retinue of soldiers transferred here and have your personal belongings moved as well. Honestly you’re just as “safe” here as you are anywhere else and can still run things from here.\n\n“Very well, the proposal makes sense, I’ll make preparations.” You reply.\n“Glad to hear it. We look forward to a closer relationship with our svelk allies in this endeavor.” Marzost says with a minor upbeat tone in his voice.\n\nYou laugh a bit at Marzost’s response.\n\n“We? I think you might be the only dero that’s looking forward to it and that’s only because you’ll get to see me more often. It’s okay, I know you can’t help staring at perfection, but I’m going to say this now since we will be seeing each other more often. Stare, look, imagine, fantasize all you want, don’t touch though. And I mean don’t attempt to touch my hand or especially anything else of mine. You’ve done it twice already in the time we’ve known each other. There will not be a third.”\n\nSome of Marzost’s enthusiasm seems slightly deflated by your words.\n\n“Very well, I meant no offense and apologize for my transgressions and promise I will behave in more fitting manner in the future.”\n“Hm, we shall see.”\n\nYou immediately get preparations underway. You give Gikil command over your fortress and tell him to remain focused on keeping the remainder of the svelk population from being overrun by undead.\n\nGikil has always been fairly uncomplicated and agrees to this task. You’re not exactly concerned with him plotting anything that will directly undermine you; at worst he’s going to abuse his power in petty ways, like fucking someone’s wife because he can. He’s never shown any real signs of actually wanting anything more than his current position though.\n\nDrunni on the other hand has always been a problem. He’s outright disagreed with you on several occasions and you just don’t feel comfortable with him skulking about if you don’t have the time to keep up on him on a regular basis.\n\n“What the fuck? I haven’t done anything!” Drunni exclaims as he’s being held by two guards.\n“You’ve been repeatedly obstinate and combative which is enough. I just don’t find those traits very appealing in a male.” You respond.\n“My apologies that I couldn’t plunge the world into a death spiral by opening a portal to the realm of the dead like your dead monkey boyfriend.”\n\nYou smile.\n\n“And that right there, is why your life choices have lead you to the situation you’re in right now.”\n“And YOUR life choices have lead us all to this shit situation we’re ALL in right now. Fuck it, we’ve been through all this before, just get it over with. I deserve to die for being such a damn fool to follow you in the first fucking place.”\n“Ah Drunni, if only you had been this agreeable before.”\n\nYou nod to your soldiers who immediately force him to his knees and shove their swords downward between his neck and shoulders, he makes the usual sounds of pain but attempts to keep them to a minimum while he never takes his eyes off you.\n\nBlood coming from his mouth and giving off a stare of absolutely hatred, you step forward and jam a dagger into one of his eyes and kick him in the chest causing his body to slump awkwardly backwards.\n\n“Should have done that a long time ago. Well? Get that body out of here before it rises up. Oh and don’t burn that one, just chop off its limbs and toss it in a field somewhere. Drunni can spend his undead life crawling about like the pathetic worm he was.”\n\nAfter taking care of that bit of business, you return to your new temporary home and take Kessla’s old room as you own. You then restart the long process of summoning and trapping demons once again.\n\nThree months later…\n\nYou’re exhausted.\n\nThe process has been going a lot slower than you hoped. You’ve only managed to capture eleven of the damn things and summoned a lot more that had to be put down.\n\nOne of the main problems besides the magic nullifying rocks all over the place making this process harder is apparently you’re actively getting “pull back” from the other side. Several of the demons you’ve summoned have mentioned about how they all know what you’ve been doing and steps have been made to prevent it.\n\nWhile none have mentioned his name specifically, you can guess that Big Red has had something to do with all this.\n\nOn top of everything else, the dero have been giving you shit. Well specifically the dero females. Almost anytime you stumble into one of those mini-shebeasts they are full of insults and disrespect. More than a few times, Marzost has had to step in to prevent something more violent from happening.\n\nIt’s all very tiresome.\n\nThe only good thing that’s come about is the reports from Gikil have stated that most of the remaining svelk communities are still holding out fairly well against the undead. Even rebellious behavior has been kept to a minimum. Still, the dead don’t rest and your continent is starting to show the same signs of spontaneous dying vegetation and ruin.\n\nThe fact is, if you don’t figure out a way to speed up your process of capturing these demons, you’re going to run out of time.\n\nIn any case it’s another day. You get ready to perform this necessary thing and make your way down to the dero lair.\n\nWhen you arrive, you see the usual dero warriors along with your own standing by. Fortunately no dero females, unfortunately Marzost has decided to pay another one of his visits.\n\n“Greetings Mistress, everything as usual has been prepared.”\n“Great. You lot make any progress on being able to close the portal after I open it?”\n“No, I’m afraid. However, I have come up with something that might make your summoning process easier.”\n“Oh?”\n“Yes, this!”\n\nMarzost pulls out a large metal syringe with glowing purple liquid inside.\n\n“And… what is that exactly?” you ask.\n“It’s a stimulant! You won’t feel as tired and you’ll be able to focus a lot better. Basically you should be able to get more accomplished, I mean I know this is all very taxing on you and every time I see you, you’re looking more fatigued.”\n“Yeah well I’m summoning demons under a lot of forces working against me, of course I’m going to be a little tired.”\n\nMarzost approaches closer, which causes you to instinctively move back. He then motions you to an area away from everyone else at which point you roll your eyes and follow.\n\n“What?” you say exasperated.\n“Mistress you’re not just tired, you’re not just exhausted, you’re DRAINED. Seriously, and I wouldn’t dare say this in front of anyone or even you normally, but have you looked in a mirror?”\n“Excuse me?”\n“You’re aging. I mean…look I know your kind are known for their long lasting youthful appearance, and I imagine you being a powerful sorceress you’ve extended it even more, but…you’re starting to show signs of age and granted it’s only a few wrinkles here and there, however…”\n“Marzost, I’m gonna stop you right there, because if this was ANY other situation, I’d kill you where you stand for talking to me in such a manner.”\n“You know I’m right. This concoction will give you that boost you need, that we ALL need because this isn’t even just about you, we’re ALL trying to get off this world before time runs out. At the rate you’re going I don’t see us achieving that.”\n\nYou stare at Marzost in anger because he is right. You are starting to show signs of aging, but that doesn’t mean you want it pointed out. He’s also right about potentially running out of time.\n\nYou don’t know about this drug though. Marzost assures you that it will work and he’d never offer it if he thought it would harm you. That last part is probably true, but it’s still a risk.\n\n“Fine, you’re right. So what then? I’m supposed to just let you inject me with this drug to make everything better? How the hell do I know what this is really going to do? For all I know I’m going to pass out and wake up covered in your dero seed.”\n“Mistress I would never!”\n“Yeah, and you aren’t getting the chance either. Have you even tested this on anyone else?”\n“Well no, but wait I’ll test it on myself first!”\n\nMarzost is about to inject himself, but you interrupt.\n\n“And what good will that do? It could very well have a different effect or not affect you at all. You little ugly buggers are known to be extremely resilient.”\n“Yeah you make a good point.”\n“You’d need a svelk to test it on, specifically a female one just to be sure. Even then one test subject isn’t very promising, but at least it might convince me better than you’re doing right now.”\n\nYou turn to call over a couple of your soldiers.\n\n“You two, go upstairs and grab a female. I don’t care which one, just get her and bring her down here.”\n\nDoesn’t take them long to bring a female svelk down, at which point there’s the predictable realization at what’s going on and the ensuing resistance. She’s subdued fairly quickly at which point you tell Marzost to inject her and then keep her locked up for observation.\n\n“Assuming she doesn’t die or show signs of being all fucked up after a month, THEN I might consider taking this so called enhancement.” You say.\n\nWith that bit of distraction over with, you get on with the business of summoning and capturing demons.\n\nOne month passes…\n\nSixteen.\n\nSixteen demons total is all you’ve managed and you feel like you can hardly get out of bed some days.\n\nEverything is working against you, the environment, time, demons, and now even your own body.\n\nYou don’t even want to look in the mirror nowadays, you’re not quite an old crone yet, but at this rate you’ll certainly be one with little to show for it.\n\nGikil’s reports say that a several of the major svelk strongholds have been having an increase in undead activity along with the landscape of the continent showing more signs of decay. More than a few of the smaller svelk communities have been overrun completely.\n\nGeneral order is still being maintained and the fight against the dead continues, but the population is starting to completely lose hope in the plan, at least those that know or even believe in it.\n\nYou’re going to have to start getting results, if only to save yourself.\n\nMarzost’s experiment seems to have worked as he claimed. The test subject has shown an increase in endurance and speed. And as far as focus is concerned, she’s tried to escape at least eight times with varying success despite new precautions put in place to prevent it. On top of all this, she was only given the one injection.\n\nThere haven’t been any negative side effects that have been noticed except an increase in aggression, but that might be just because she’s pissed about her situation. She has threatened to kill you personally in at least half of her escape attempts.\n\nThere’s also the increase in lack of sleep and appetite, but you could get A LOT accomplished if you didn’t need to stop to sleep or eat.\n\nIt might be worth using the drug.\n",
  "page 50": "You’ve had enough of this lovesick fool’s overfamiliarity with you especially when you have not given nor desired any from him. You can barely contain your disgust.\n\nWhile his plan has merit, you hardly see any reason to keep involving the dero in it. The gate has already been prepared, it just needs a power source which Marzost has already told you what is required. You’re fairly certain you and even the likes of Drunni can figure out the rest.\n\nNo, you’ll go through with the original plan you had. You already have the undead to deal with, there’s no reason to have another element that’s been draining your resources for years (in the form of your females) Besides, they’re a lot weaker now, you’re within their walls and even the forces they do have are currently divided, some are on the surface, some are still fighting undead in tunnels. There’s never been a better time to strike.\n\nYou slowly move your hand away and address Marzost.\n\n“Yes, your plan has much merit Marzost. I suppose we can continue our alliance, but I need to go talk to my two advisors first. Let them know what’s going on and smooth out their potential whining. You understand.” You say.\n“Of course Mistress. I shall wait right here.” Marzost says.\n\nYou turn to walk back to your army, making a mental note of what to strike first and how much energy is going to be required to cast a protective barrier over your army. It’s going to take a lot due to all the magic nullifying rock everywhere.\n\nYour thoughts are suddenly interrupted when portion of your head is blown off. You actually see out of your remaining eye that wasn’t destroyed by the gunshot part of your brain splatter a short distance in front of you before you collapse to the ground.\n\nMarzost might have been a lovesick fool, but he wasn’t stupid.\n\nYou’re “Mistress”, you make important decisions all yourself, you don’t need to smooth anything over or discuss anything with so-called advisors. Marzost knew that and correctly assumed you were going to order an attack. Your back was turned, there was never a better time to strike.\n\nThe sounds of shouting are distant in your dying ears, and while there’s a very good chance the svelk will win even without magic assistance, you won’t be around to see the victory.\n\nYou also don’t get to see any peace in the afterlife either because where you go is not a pleasant place.\n",
  "page 53": "Yes. You see it all so clearly. Dying IS the only way to reunite with Francis at this point. You’ll find him again in the afterlife.\n\nIt’s a long shot, but it’s worth it. Worth more than continuing to struggle here at least.\n\nYou lower your defenses and look at Belina’s corpse which is still in a position ready to strike.\n\n“Well? You going to stand there and rot or are you going to kill me?” you say.\n\nBelina’s arm comes down and stabs you in the chest. It hurts like hell, but it isn’t enough to kill you. You instead fall to the floor in pain and Belina is soon on top of you and stabbing you repeatedly.\n\n“Fu..ck…taki..ng too long…” you utter while coughing up blood.\n\nTakes all the energy you have left, but you manage to immolate yourself along with Belina, killing both of you and ensuring your body won’t be coming back either.\n\nOf course it’s a pretty excruciating death and you definitely scream out as you burn alive. The unsurprising bit, is none of your underlings even get to you in time to check what all the screaming is until you’re well cooked and dead.\n\nWhich is just as well since you wanted to die in the first place, though you probably would have gone about it differently if you had to do it all over again.\n\nAnd it isn’t just about how you died.\n\nYou don’t go to the same place as Francis like you thought. You figured he’d be in hell. He still could be, but if he is, you aren’t there.\n\nWherever you are is worse. Much worse. It’s reserved mainly for the most terrible of souls, namely those that have directly pissed off the gods.\n\nYou don’t know what gods you pissed off or how, but that hardly matters given the shit you’ve put yourself in.\n\nWhat does matter is you’re being perpetually tortured and subjected to pain on a level that doesn’t even compare to what hell could do. Your mind is broken and you go insane, but the pain lasts for all eternity.\n",
  "page 52": "Six months later…\n\nYou can’t believe it.\n\nOr maybe you just didn’t want to when you originally lost contact six months ago.\n\n“Mistress?”\n\nIt was inevitable, especially with what’s going on. All humans eventually die early. That’s what happens to them.\n\nStill, he wasn’t really human. He wasn’t like the rest. He was…unique.\n\n“Mistress!”\n\nYou temporarily stop staring into the distance and re-direct your attention to Belina\n\n“Yes, what?” you say.\n“I asked what are your new orders? I’ve given you my report.” Belina asks.\n“Report…report…are you sure he’s dead? I mean are you absolutely certain? I know you aren’t the most competent in these matters providing accurate information.”\n\nBelina tries to stop herself from visibly getting annoyed by your insult, but she fails. Though she’s probably more annoyed that she’s already repeated herself on this particular information at least three times the first time she mentioned it in her report.\n\n“Again… Mistress, the Emperor of the Empire is DEAD. Several of my agents died bringing me this information AND double-checking it because I KNEW such information would be of major importance to you.” Belina replies.\n“How? How did he die?” you ask.\n“I wasn’t there Mistress, but I was relayed information that a cloaked figure of immense power that has been sighted in various locations of Evigrus wiped out the Emperor’s palace including the Emperor. According to the agent who I was told looked like he was already a walking corpse from the high amount of death magic he was exposed to when reporting to another, the Emperor even put up no struggle before he was struck down. He just allowed himself to die.”\n“I don’t believe it! Not struggle?! That wasn’t him! That was never him! He always was a fighter! From the first day of class he defied me! He never listened! Never realized that only I knew what was best for him!”\n“Be that as it may, several of my agents have more or less confirmed his demise. The Empire is completely gone and Evigrus is lost. Undead are everywhere and just standing on the continent feels like the very life is being drained from you. It’s starting to resemble the Isle of Mortos, though from my return it doesn’t look like Dokkrus is doing much better. Drunni mentioned you’re trying to open a portal to another world?”\n“What? I’m asking the questions here and these reports of his death are imprecise. You weren’t there and you’re going by not just second hand, but third or even fourth hand information? I knew you were incompetent in these matters.”\n\nBelina, who looks much the worse for wear since you last saw her years ago can’t contain herself any more.\n\n“Fuck you Semra! Fuck you and your delusional obsessive crush you had on your pet monkey! Drunni was right, YOU brought all this shit on us! And I heard you were giving female svelk over to the fucking dero? What the fuck? You trying to kill off our race before the undead can? Shit, YOU have led not just our people, but the entire world to ruin because YOU didn’t do what should have been done long ago! He’s NOT coming back. You had a mental connection with him correct? You stopped having it didn’t you? You know why? BECAUSE HE’S FUCKING DEAD AND YOU KNOW IT! “\n\nYour eyes narrow.\n\n“Yes. I do.”\n\nAt that moment Belina’s anger goes from one of a worry as she realizes her outburst has turned your mood even worse than it already was.\n\n“Shi…” is all she gets out before you raise both of your hands and lighting shoots out from them. Belina’s body is enveloped by your blast as every part of her is fried instantly. She was already weakened from her time on Evigrus, it doesn’t time much to kill her.\n\nHer body drops to the floor still sizzling which you walk over to and stare at.\n\n“There was no need to insult my intelligence and point out the obvious though Belina. I’m well aware he’s been dead for months now. Still, I suppose someone else saying it out loud was helpful in giving that last push for me to put it into perspective.”\n\nYou crouch down near Belina’s corpse.\n\n“I suppose my anger was more about how you told me he died, rather than that he died at all. The idea that he just gave up…it’s just… “\n\nTears fall from your eyes.\n\n“…I always thought…he’d finally see that I was the only one…who ever…really loved… him and we’d start over, perhaps even in that new world…”\n\nYour voice cracks and you start to break down as whimpers of anguish of your loss begins to sink in.\n\n“…we’d be happy…and then…and then…I’d be the one to kill him…”\n\nYou let it all out and cry like you did when your father died. The pain of this loss is just as great as that one was.\n\nYour emotional release is interrupted when you notice Belina’s body twitch. You see her burned hand rise from the floor and a desiccated groan emanate from her. You stop your crying, step away from her and begin to chuckle\n\n“You’re right again Belina, I need to stop this pathetic display, stop hanging on to the past and decide what the fuck I’m going to do for the future. Feh. The Future. What remains of it on this world anyway.”\n\nYou see Belina slowly crawl towards you and attempt to push herself up off the floor.\n\n“I’ve only been able to bind twelve demons out of the thirty or so I’ve conjured. Had to kill more of them and lost svelk in the process of doing so most of the time. Who knows if this plan to open a portal to a new world is even going to work. All I have are the assurances of some dero that’s sickeningly infatuated with me and a few of the demonic tomes I’ve been browsing through.”\n\nBelina’s corpse is now standing upright a few feet away; she grabs a blackened dagger from her side. She then makes groaning noises as she lurches towards you.\n\n“Even if going to a new world works, do I really want to fucking start ALL over again with the fucking dero and a bunch of svelk that would all cut my damn throat if they could, despite the fact I’m saving all their worthless lives? I definitely know I’m already not popular with the female population of our race at this point…but then I never could get along with any of them. Maybe Drunni was right when he once suggested that I’d be happy if I was the only svelk female in existence and only had the males as servants and warriors. I suppose it would explain why never got along with my daughter. Maybe it had something to do with my mother dying in childbirth…bah I’m fucking babbling…”\n\nBelina’s corpse is now almost upon you with her dagger raised high ready to strike.\n\n“The funny thing is I’m tempted to just say fuck it and let your corpse kill me Belina. There’s a strong part of me that really sees no reason to go on. Francis is dead and this world soon will be as well it seems. Maybe Francis had the right idea and just throw it in.”\n",
  "page 110": "What are you even thinking about? Running away? You don’t seriously want to be living on the streets. You’re going back.\n\nYour concerns about your magic practices have subsided a bit anyway. As least as far as being in immediate trouble over them. You’re certain that nobody at the park noticed you and certainly nobody saw you bring the rabbit back to life.\n\nThough you believe you’ll have to give the park a rest for a while, especially since you figure Miss Olga is going to be angry with you with you get back so late. You’ll probably be restricted to indoors until you’re old enough to leave by law.\n\nAs strange as it is, there is a bit of comfort in that idea. Granted you were just thinking about how confining the orphanage can be, but it is home you suppose. You guess maybe that’s why you don’t really want to leave. It’s the only home you’ve ever known and despite everything, you don’t want that to change.\n\nYou eventually see the orphanage and prepare yourself for the scolding and potentially worse you’re going to get when you enter.\n\nYou get a few steps in and you already hear Miss Olga call you from the kitchen. No point in avoiding the inevitable.\n\nYou enter the kitchen and see Miss Olga cleaning her pots, plates and other cutlery. She’s not even bothering to look at you.\n\n“So, you have a nice time in the park today? You must have, if you’re coming in this late.” Miss Olga says.\n“Sorry Miss Olga I lost track of time.” You say.\n“You can’t tell when the sun is setting?”\n\nYou don’t answer. Miss Olga looks over at you and shakes her head.\n\n“I swear I don’t know what to do with you. It’s bad enough you left in the middle of adoption day as usual, but now you’re just coming and going whenever you feel like it.”\n“I’m sorry, I just…”\n“Just what Catalina? Just decide that you’re going to do whatever now? Fine. I’m done with trying to guide you.”\n\nYour eyes widen and back up when you hear this, thinking you’re on a one way trip to where Patty went. Miss Olga once again shakes her and sighs before speaking.\n\n“No, not that. Though I’m surprised you’re even worried about it given how little you care about getting adopted and how little you seem to respect me.”\n“I…do.”\n“Do what?”\n“Respect you.”\n“Huh. You have a funny way of showing it then child. In any case, it’s obvious I’ve failed to get through to you. I have several other children I have to worry about and I can’t constantly worry about you. So if you want to remain a parentless orphan drifting through and stay here until you have to leave, then fine. But if that’s the case, you WILL be pulling your weight more around here starting tomorrow. Go to the park all you want on your free time, but you’ll find you will have less of that soon, because you’ll be helping me with everything I have to keep up around here.”\n\nWell you sort of knew there would be repercussions, so you’re not exactly surprised. You’re just glad Miss Olga isn’t sending you away. As far as having more to do around here, well you were going to give the park a break for a while anyway.\n\n“Yes, Miss Olga.” You say.\n“Hm. Now head on up to bed and I’m sure Chloe is going to speak to you about her news as soon as you get there, but keep it brief. You’re going to have a lot of work tomorrow and you’ll need the rest.”\n“News?”\n“Well if you’d been here, you would have found out she got adopted today. In fact she would have probably left today, but I won’t just give her away to some man without proof of him having a wife. So he’s coming back tomorrow with her and if everything checks out, Chloe will be going to her new home.”\n\nYou’re a bit in shock. Miss Olga sees this immediately.\n\n“Yeah, she got adopted before you. Surprised me too. But then, it’s what she always wanted.”\n\nMiss Olga returns to her cleaning and you go to the sleeping area. You don’t know how to feel right now. There’s a part of you that feels hurt.\n\nYou know it isn’t Chloe’s fault, but you just thought she’d always be here with you and now she won’t be.\n\nFrom the description of the man, it sounds like the one you spoke to about his wife being sick. You guess he got over those assumptions he made about orcs.\n\nYou crawl into bed and immediately Chloe get out of bed and goes over to you.\n\n“Catalina! Where were you? The park?” Chloe whispers.\n“Where else would I be?” you answer.\n“True. Practicing magic I guess too. Well I wanted to tell you that something impossible happened today! I got adopted!”\n“Yeah, Miss Olga told me. Congratulations. It’s what you’ve always wanted.”\n\nChloe senses you’re not exactly in a good mood about this news.\n\n“Are you mad? Please don’t be mad! I…I could stay! Or…wait, he could adopt you too! He said you were talking to him earlier!” Chloe says.\n\nYou give a brief smile.\n\n“No. This is what’s best for you. You always wanted this and it was bound to happen that we were going to part ways eventually.”\n“Yeah, but I figured it would be you getting adopted, not me.”\n“Life is full of surprises. Look Chloe, it’s fine. I’m really happy for you. I mean it. Now I have to get some rest because Miss Olga is going to start putting me to hard work for all my park trips.”\n“Okay. Well I suppose it’s not final yet. Maybe he’ll change his mind or something and I’ll get to stay.”\n\nChloe’s words are followed by a pat on your shoulder before she returns to her own bed. You are left with your thoughts of the future, then sleep, then dreams of darkness…\n\nThe next day, you’re awakened from your sleep earlier and put to work by Miss Olga. She has you helping preparing breakfast for everyone. Since you’re not exactly knowledgeable on cooking, she still takes care of most of it, while you’re mostly doing preparation of the table and such.\n\nMost of the day passes with you doing a lot of cleaning. While Miss Olga has children pitching in to do chores, you’ve never had to do them like this. In fact, you realize all the times you snuck away to the park probably resulted in you doing less chores than the other children.\n\nNo sneaking off to the park today though.\n\nLater on, you see the man who spoke to you yesterday come in with a woman. You’re guessing this is his wife. She’s pale looking and walking slowly, you’re guessing he wasn’t joking about her being sick.\n\nHe sees you and smiles as you sweep the floor. You see Miss Olga greet him and his wife and they disappear into another room where she can presumably make the final judgment.\n\n“This is it.” You hear Chloe say, causing you to turn around. She looks very nervous.\n“I’m sure everything will go fine.” You reply.\n\nWhile Chloe offered to stay at the orphanage with you last night, now its very apparent what her desires really are. Even in all the mischief she’s been involved in with you, this is the most nervous you’ve ever seen her. You stop working for a moment to try to keep her from completely freaking out.\n\nYou start talking about all the new stuff she’ll soon be able to see and do. She says how much she’ll miss stuff here, which then leads to a series of “Remember when…” discussions, which takes her mind of things.\n\nTime passes and before you both know it, Miss Olga and Chloe’s perspective parents exit the room they were talking in.\n\n“Chloe, there you are. Good. Go gather whatever clothes and such you want to take with you, because today you’re going home with your new parents, Mr. and Mrs. Moznik or in your case Mom and Dad.”\n\nChloe upon hearing the news nearly collapses into tears of joy. You help her back up and her new parents come over to assist. You step aside and they both hug her and tell her to hurry up so they can show her her new room.\n\nChloe quickly nods and runs to get her stuff, which honestly isn’t a lot. Just a small bag of clothes.\n\nChloe says goodbye to Miss Olga who smiles and wishes her well. Chloe then goes to you.\n\n“I’m going to miss you so much.” Chloe says and hugs you tightly.\n“I’ll miss you too…okay that’s too tight.” You say.\n“Oh sorry. Hey I won’t forget about you! I mean I could still write to you or maybe even visit!”\n“Sure.”\n\nChloe turns to her new parents who take her hand and walk out with her. You stand at the entranceway with the broom still in hand watching her leave and get farther away until she’s out of sight.\n\n“That could have been you, you know.” Miss Olga says, walking to doorway to stand near you.\n“I know.” You reply.\n“You really don’t care do you?”\n“No, I guess not. Chloe needed it more than me anyway.”\n“Well I suppose she did at that.”\n“I hope it works out for her.”\n“I was a little concerned with Mrs. Moznik’s health, but they seem to be good people. I’m sure they’ll be fine.”\n\nYou look down and nod.\n\n“Catalina, I think you’ve done enough work for awhile, why don’t you go to the park for awhile. You can come back to help set up for dinner.” Miss Olga says.\n“No, I think I’ll stay here.” You answer\n“Very well then. You know what time dinner is.”\n\nYou nod and go back to your sweeping.\n",
  "page 66": "You’ve got more important shit to do than to fuck about with the dero. In fact you don’t even want to see another one of those stunted freaks again even it’s only to kill them.\n\nBesides, if Gikil wants to be your “Plan B” he’s going to have to prove himself. You figure he can take care of this bit of business first.\n\n“Gikil, I want you to go get those crystals from the dero, I don’t care if you have to eliminate what remains of their pathetic settlement.” You order.\n“Yes Mistress.” Gikil responds.\n\nYou grab his arm before he leaves.\n\n“And Gikil? Maybe just MAYBE I’ll be in the mood for that other plan you mentioned when you return.” You say.\n\nGikil barely manages to keep his composure, but his face says it all and he starts running as quickly as her can shouting for his soldiers to follow him immediately.\n\nGlad to see he’s motivated for a change.\n\nLater that day you ponder the potential plan Gikil proposed and decide you’ll go through with it when he gets back since you suppose it doesn’t hurt to have a back up plan and you can’t imagine the act itself willl last very long.\n\nYou prepare a fertility potion. You haven’t prepared a potion like this in centuries, but you want to make sure this goes right the first time.\n\nIn a couple days it’s done and you chug it down. Tastes every bit as awful as you remember. No sign of Gikil yet though and you begin to get slightly annoyed that the idiot might have gotten himself killed since he should have been back by now.\n\nThe next day and the raiding party returns confirming your annoyance. Idiot probably was so distracted thinking about fucking you that he wasn’t focused on battle.\n\n“Typical male, always coming up short when it counts. No matter, were you lot able to at least get the crystals?” you ask.\n“Yes Mistress, we gathered as much as we could carry. As for the dero, several of them were killed in the ensuing battle, but the remainder retreated into a building. Since General Gikil was dead and the crystals were secured which were the main objective anyway, further attack on the dero seemed like it would be a waste of manpower so I ordered us to return.” A younger svelk reports and then motions for two battle worn soldiers with two large bags which they open up to show you filled with crystals. More than enough for your purposes.\n\n“Hmm, smart move on your part, or perhaps just cowardice but whatever the reason, you made the right decision because I would have really been pissed if I hadn’t received the crystals.”\n“I am glad I could please you Mistress.”\n\nYou walk over to the male addressing you and study him closely. He’s nothing remarkable, but he’s not unattractive. You wonder if you shouldn’t just fuck this male instead. One is just as good as another for what you’re planning. And he at least got back home alive.\n\nHe remains looking straight ahead until you grab his crotch and shove your tongue in his mouth. He looks mildly surprised when you stop to address him.\n\n“Name?” you ask.\n“Arrak, Mistress.”\n“Well Arrak, you haven’t pleased me yet and I doubt you will, but this is your lucky day for a chance at it. You two, take those crystals to the appropriate location. You, come with me.”\n\nYou leave the other two soldiers and lead the young commander into your bedroom.\n\nThe act itself is rather mundane as expected though not completely without enjoyment. After it’s over you tell Arrak to get out.\n\nFive days pass…\n\nYou cast the spell again, just to make sure. You wait and there’s no doubt about it, you’re with child for good or ill.\n\nNow you just have to hold out for nine months of undead attacks while being burdened with child and an ever-smaller group of “loyalists.” No small feat, but you figure you should be able to weather it as long as you don’t over do it.\n\nOf course now you’re wondering if you shouldn’t continue to gather up souls and still try to reach that quota anyway. Just because Plan B is more or less secure, doesn’t mean continuing with Plan A isn’t still an option.\n",
  "page 65": "Days later…\n\nDrunni stares up at you with absolute hatred in his eyes. He hasn’t spoken once since he was stripped naked and marched out of his cell to be strapped to this table before you. You look down at him with a knife in your hand knowing that this is how it should be.\n\n“Oh come on Drunni, you knew eventually it had to end this way. Well perhaps not in this exact manner, but given the tension between us, it was going to either be me or you and that was no contest at all.” You say.\n\nDrunni just continues to stare.\n\n“No snippy response? No pithy come back? No final insult?”\n“Suck my dick bitch.” Drunni says.\n\nYou look over at his unimpressive display of manhood and then back to his face.\n\n“Oh if only we had the time.” You say with a smirk and then shove the knife into his chest.\n\nDrunni gasps and struggles a moment as his body goes into its final death throes. You then make a few chants and soon see a wisp rise from his body and enter the crystal nearby. Drunni stops moving completely.\n\nYou then motion to your nearby lackeys to quickly remove the body and throw it into the nearby fire before it starts reanimating.\n\n“Well that’s one. Bring in the next.” You say.\n\nTwo months later…\n\nYou’re fucking exhausted.\n\nTrapping the souls is more tiring than it should be. You’re guessing the increase in necromantic magic in the “air” is making it more difficult for you as you’re literally fighting against the natural order of them being collected for their proper place.\n\nUndead of all types have been popping up all over Dokkrus and the rate is increasing. You don’t know if it’s because of what you’re doing or if it’s just getting closer to the end. Probably both.\n\nSvelk civilization (such as it was) has broken down completely. After Gikil “collected” the first few settlements it didn’t take long before a few escapees from these purges managed to spread the word to other svelk communities. Almost ALL of them declared themselves independent and hostile towards you.\n\nA couple of the smaller communities in an effort to hedge their bets and at least save some of their lives have remained “loyal” and offered some of their people as sacrifices while the rest pledged to join Gikil’s band of marauders (While he might like to still think of himself as a general head of a glorious army, you’re realistic enough to see it as it really is).\n\nGikil’s efforts while generally successful are resulting in more dead than captured. He of course makes excuses for this, and he may even be doing the best he can under the circumstances, but it doesn’t really help you.\n\nIn at least one instance, an entire community committed mass suicide as a final “fuck you” and rising as undead horrors, along with depriving you of souls.\n\nAny remaining dero allies you had on the surface have died in battle with undead. You haven’t had any contact with the dero community since going with your current plan but then you haven’t really bothered. You might have to soon however given that you’re nearly out of crystals.\n\nAnd the worst thing about it is you’ve only managed nearly three hundred souls so far and more than half of your crystals are already gone. You really thought you’d be able to shove more souls into them, but it looks like you’re going to meet with the dero or have to start making soul jars and all the time consuming process that entails.\n\nWhile you didn’t think this plan was going to go smoothly, you didn’t expect it to be the cluster fuck it’s become.\n\nYou collapse on your bed wishing that Francis was beside you.\n\n“That could be arranged you know.” You hear a voice say.\n\nYou look over and once again see Big Red in the form of Francis.\n\n“While the illusion might be a fun diversion, I’m hesitant to allow one of your kind’s seed anywhere near me. Last thing I need is demonic spawn ripping its way out of the source of all my power.”\n\nYour remark causes a laugh from Big Red who instantly transforms back into his true form (Or at least the one closer to his true origins).\n\n“Is there any reason for your clumsy attempts at trying to seduce me?” you ask.\n“Oh trust me, if that was my intent, I would have taken your father’s form. No, I’m just here to check up on your progress as it were. Nearly three hundred so far. Part of me is impressed that you’ve managed so many under the circumstances and within such a short time. However, time really isn’t on your side. This world’s death is growing very close.” Big Red says.\n“Ah, so you haven’t come to check on my progress so much as you’ve come to gloat and try to convince me to take the lesser deal.”\n“I mean I’d LOVE for you to just hand me a thousand souls, but I don’t see you making that quota in time. You’ve got more than enough for the other deal though. If you were concerned about your soul, I wouldn’t even get you until you died anyway and you’ve been clever enough to avoid that for centuries. You’re doing it right now. And trust me, it’s better off with me than anyone else given your history.”\n“I find that difficult to believe.”\n“Believe it. In fact, I’ll even sweeten the deal and throw in the promise that I wouldn’t trade your soul to anyone else, your soul would only belong to me for all eternity.”\n“That’s a really piss poor attempt at trying to convince me. However since you’re in a helpful mood, will dero souls be acceptable in place of svelk? I get that they’re going to be of lower quality, but compared to humans surely…”\n“The dero…ugh.” Big Red remarks interrupting you.\n\nBig Red gets off the bed and nearly looks a bit revolted.\n\n“I have observed these dero and they aren’t suitable. Those stunted little freaks are barely alive. They have no souls.”\n“What?”\n“I can detect no soul within them. I can’t even detect their blood or life force. It’s almost as if their entire race is already dead and it’s not due to the necromantic energy in the air or anything like that. Whatever was done to them or whatever they’ve done to themselves has rendered them soulless and totally useless to me.”\n“Hm. That’s interesting. I suppose that explains a lot of their race’s certain views on life and death.”\n“In any case the deal is still on when you decide. I’ve left the contract for the hundred soul deal on a table nearby. Just sign it when you want me to arrive to get your out of this mess.”\n\nBig Red disappears and you just lay in bed trying to figure out a way you can survive all this body AND soul intact.\n\nThree days later…\n\n“A good haul this time Mistress.” Gikil remarks.\n“Hm, I suppose. One hundred and twenty seven captives is better than you usually do. How did you manage it?”\n“Oddly this community had largely been spared undead attacks, but were suffering from famine due the land dying nearby. All we had to do was offer food, the fools let us in and we easily overpowered them due to a lack of strength. Some of them had obviously been resorting to cannibalism by eating the dead though. Those were the ones that put up the most resistance and had to be killed.”\n“Hm. Community was probably on its way to becoming ghouls at that point, good thing you got to them when you did.”\n“Mistress I have another matter to discuss with you…it’s about the deal with the souls.”\n“Oh?”\n\nGikil looks a bit hesitant. Even scared.\n\n“Out with it! I’m not likely to kill you whatever you tell me considering you’re the only useful person I have right now.”\n“Well, um… the demon you said you had the deal with Big Red. He came to me.”\n\nYour eyebrow raises. Obviously Big Red is trying to create some dissension in the ranks to get your soul.\n\n“This should be interesting.”\n“He said there was another deal he offered you which didn’t require as many souls.”\n“I see. And even as a male of your lesser intelligence, you do realize that selling my soul is not an option?”\n“Yes, I understand that Mistress.”\n“Then why are we even discussing it? If Big Red thought you could convince me, he’s even worse at this than I thought. I will die before that happens. And if YOU are thinking about rebelling unless I capitulate, you’re sadly mistaken as well. I’ll throw YOU on that table and add another soul to the total.”\n“Mistress, no! I would never betray you! I’ve followed you this far, believe in your goals and if I may be so bold, I have come to…feel a greater affection for you.”\n\nNot completely unexpected, though you’re wondering where he’s going to go with this sudden courageous burst of feelings for you.\n\n“Yeah I already know you want to fuck me Gikil, most people do, no surprise there.” You say dismissively.\n“No! It’s more than that!” Gikil exclaims and boldly wraps his arms around you. He looks into your eyes and before he can continue, you speak.\n\n“Okay. That’s ONE. Better make this REALLY good Gikil and you will release me NOW.”\n\nGikil obeys and backs off. He paces a bit and rubs his hands over his face and hair.\n\n“Stupid. I shouldn’t have done that. I beg forgiveness for my…”\n“Gikil you are wasting time. Calm yourself and say what you fucking mean and stop being a cowering male.” You demand.\n“You’re right. I don’t care if you kill me afterwards for my forwardness, I should speak. I’ve grown not just in awe of your handling of this situation we’re in, but attraction to you. Your confidence, your dedication, your leadership, all of it, is just so magnetic that I can’t contain it any longer, but I also mention this because I have a proposal.”\n“Proposal? Are you seriously asking that we be joined?”\n“Well I would hope so one day, but no, nothing so formal. I was going to suggest that we have a child.”\n\nNow you don’t know whether to laugh or kill him. Or laugh while you’re killing him.\n\n“And WHY the fuck would I want to do that? Let alone with you?”\n“To trick Big Red out of the lesser deal! He said he needed your blood as a confirmation of the deal right? A baby from your loins would qualify! We just drain the baby of its blood after it’s born, and sign whatever contract with its blood. By the time Big Red figures it out, he won’t be able to do shit!”\n\nNow that is an interesting plan you hadn’t considered. In fact you’re surprised it even came from Gikil. You suppose even the mundane have a moment of brilliance.\n\nOf course there’s a few hiccups with this potential plan.\n\nFirst, you’re wondering if this “loophole” would even work. You imagine Big Red has probably taken something like into consideration, then again given his recent bad attempts to trying to convince you to give up your soul, he might not be as competent as he tries to appear and it’s escaped his attention.\n\nSecond, you’d have to be pregnant. Getting pregnant wouldn’t be an issue; you can always mix up a fertility potion for such a thing to increase the odds. It’s the actual being pregnant bit that isn’t exactly desirable. You didn’t care for it the last two times you were and it makes you much more vulnerable. Not to mention you’d have to endure at least nine more months of this undead onslaught before you could even kill the spawn. Who knows if you’d have nine months.\n\nThird, well you’ll ask Gikil again.\n\n“If I were to carry out this cunning plan, I repeat, WHY would I do it with you?” you ask.\n“I have no answer Mistress. Indeed you could have your way with any lucky man. I can only say that with all confidence I am currently the most desirable mate that while not equal to you, is at least as you pointed out, the most useful and will continue to be while in your service. And as I have somewhat already said in so many bumbling words, I have genuine feelings for you and can only hope that even after all this is behind us, our relationship can grow even deeper.” Gikil replies.\n\nWell it’s enough reverence for you to hold off on killing him and he does make a strong case. There’s still a part of you though that isn’t quite ready to jump on Gikil’s dick just yet though even if he’s eager for it. After all, you’re the one taking the risk of carrying a child even if it’s to ultimately save your soul.\n\nSpeaking of souls, the logistics of making even one soul jar to shove further souls into is already giving you a headache on top of everything else you’re thinking about.\n\nYou think back to Gikil’s suggestion awhile back of raiding the dero for their crystals, and believe that now might the time to do such a thing. It isn’t like you’re exactly following the dero plan anymore and they might be a little weaker now since you know they were suffering from undead attacks as well the last time you were there.\n\nThe question is if you’re going to send Gikil to do it or just do it yourself. You’re confident victory is assured either way, though it’s a question of personal risk versus getting the job done efficiently.\n",
  "page 68": "Might as well increase your chances for survival. Besides, it isn’t like being with spawn is going to slow you down in performing what you need to do to kill captives and capture their souls.\n\nIn any case, you’ve wasted enough time. You need to get started on all those recent captives and send your soldiers to go get more because you’ve still got a long way to go. Since he’s effectively taken Gikil’s place, you put Arrak in charge of his duties.\n\nAfter a week, you’ve finished off all the current captives and are still awaiting more. Arrak eventually returns with only twenty-four. Much like Gikil, he explains that picking are very difficult now, since most of what remains of the svelk are behind heavily fortified towns or outright fortresses. (The actual cities are mostly just ruins now filled with ghouls and walking corpses at this point).\n\nUnfortunately with your lack of manpower, you can’t really afford to launch full on sieges of such places even if you had the time to do so. Arrak however believes that he and a few others can potentially sneak into the towns and create enough havoc inside and ultimately lower the defensive gates to let more in. From there it’s just a matter of subduing enough and then getting out of there.\n\nYou honestly don’t care how he does it, as long as it gets done.\n\nTwo months pass and Arrak is more or less making good on his promises and you’re getting a slight increase in captives, but it’s still a paltry amount compared to what you really need.\n\nWhat’s worse is the situation on your continent is getting even more dire. The process of decay and death has accelerated greatly and it’s harder for what remains of your soldiers to even hunt for animals.\n\nAt least one attempt on your life was made by a group of female soldiers, fortunately besides being slightly weak from malnourishment; they weren’t a match for you, given your magic capabilities and naturally suspicious nature. You were on to them before they even attempted it.\n\nStill, the exertion of just fending off the attack took it out of you a lot more than it should have. You’re tired quite a bit nowadays and it isn’t just your pregnancy on top of your usual activity. The very environment around you is becoming infused with death and you’re starting to feel the effects directly.\n\nThere’s nothing that can be done though except hope you can get through this.\n\n1 month later\n\nYour time’s up.\n\nEverything is dead or soon will be and you’re so drained right now you can’t even stand up. You don’t even have the energy to sign Big Red’s damn contract on the table not that far away from you to get out of this.\n\nYou lie on your bedroom floor in a puddle of blood. The paltry remnants of the fetus from your miscarriage lie not too far away from you. It was almost as if it never was given the size and what was left.\n\nThe last time you looked in a mirror, you were beginning to show signs of age, even now your hands shake and look like that of a withered crone’s.\n\nYou cling to life still, though you don’t really know why given the amount of pain your body is currently feeling.\n\nPart of it is the will to be a survivor as you always have been, but there’s another reason. These last few days you’ve been to ponder what will actually become of you when you die. Given your deeds, you don’t think it will be any place good.\n\nBig Red heavily implied you’d go to the Infernal Realm like most of your people and given what you know of demons, you’re going to have a rough time of it.\n\nHowever, you’ve been trying to mentally prepare yourself for those horrors. You don’t know how you’re going to do it, but some how, some way; you’re going to find a way to thrive there.\n\nYou may very well end up as a lowly fuck slave plaything for some demon to torture, but you’re not going to stay that way. You’ll find a way to rise. You always do.\n\nEverything is starting to go dark, death is coming soon.\n\nThough you weren’t expecting it to come personally.\n\nYou suddenly see a faceless hooded figure hovering over you. This is it. This is the Death God. You don’t feel fear though.\n\n“So you’ve come.” You say.\n“Well I probably wouldn’t have gotten here as soon directly if you hadn’t been stealing souls away in crystals. What were you thinking?” the Death God replies.\n“Escape.”\n“Hm. Pity you didn’t destroy them like you did with those gnome souls. Depriving the infernals of even a few is always amusing.”\n\nYour eyes widen when the Death God mentions the gnomes.\n\n“What? You think I didn’t know about that? I know everything about you. In fact I probably know more about you than I really needed to thanks to Francis. He wasn’t very fond of you, you know.”\n“Yeah, well at least he’s where I’m going. He’s not going to be rid of me. Not even in death.”\n“And where is it exactly that you believe that you’re going?”\n\nYou struggle to get out the words as you feel it getting harder to breathe.\n\n“H…hell.”\n\nYour statement is followed by a short dark chuckle by the Death God. It’s unnerving to the point where fear finally takes hold of your body\n\n“Oh I’m afraid you’re quite mistaken. Francis is not in the infernal realm. He actually was going to some place much worse, but he didn’t since he willingly surrendered after I offered a deal to him. I can truly say, he’s in a much better place now. Well at least for the time being.” The Death God says.\n“W…what?! What deal? What did you propose to him?” you ask.\n“It is of no importance and before you continue with that idea in your head right now, no I’m not offering the same one to you.”\n“Wh…why not? I can assure you, I’d be more useful than whatever it is you proposed to Francis. ”\n“I don’t doubt that you’d be adequate for the task, but it really was sort of a one time offer to a suitable mortal. First come first serve and all that. Also, Francis despite being a ruthless bastard, he wasn’t really unnecessarily cruel or got off on torture. You on the other hand…well you’re just mean and I don’t like you.”\n“Fuck…you.”\n“Yes, I’m sure you would if it got you out of where you’re going. Speaking of which, I got more bad news for you. Certain gods are REALLY pissed about you completely obliterating those gnome souls and someone has to pay. So you’re not going to the infernal realm either.”\n“Wh…where am I…going?”\n\nThe Death God says nothing and just hovers closer to you. You see a skeletal hand reach out to your head and the brief sight of a grinning skull before it disappears into the darkness of the hood again. Terror fills your body, you scream out as the hand touches your forehead. Your heart doesn’t stop beating but instead rapidly pulsates to the point where it explodes in your chest.\n\nEverything goes black for a split moment and then when you become aware again, you find that your surroundings have changed severely.\n\nEverything around you is wrong. Your mind cannot comprehend the utterly bizarre things about you. In fact you’re not even standing on the ground, you’re floating throughout some sort of fluid space.\n\nYou see grisly parodies of various people you’ve known. They all taunt and hurt you in ways that you never thought possible. These mimics then will melt into disgusting things like hordes of oversized worms and maggots which will proceed to crawl all over you. As you float helplessly you can feel vileness, enter every orifice of your body. All of your senses are assaulted at the same time and the smell, the taste, the feeling, the sight and the sounds are all indescribably awful.\n\nEvery once in a while strange tentacle creatures float nearby and assault your body and your mind even worse than the mimics. Other times the very plane seems to do the same thing. Sometimes you are completely ripped apart only to be reformed again and not always in the correct way. You go completely insane, but never to a point where you no longer care or are bothered by the horrific experiences you are enduring.\n\nThere is no defense, no hope, and no escape from this living nightmare. Your mind shattered, your body broken, and your spirit crushed, you continue screaming having no other choice but to suffer as you made so many suffer in your former life.\n",
  "page 67": "If you do it, you won’t need as many soldiers to help you thus cutting down the potential loss of manpower. Gikil’s skills are better suited to what he’s already doing.\n\nGikil seems disappointed that you’re not giving the garden of eternal delights to him, but is also concerned about your safety.\n\n“Mistress, I really believe I should wipe out the dero. There is no reason to put yourself at more risk than you need to.” Gikil remarks.\n“Gikil, I don’t doubt you wouldn’t be successful, but let’s just say I’m better than you. Even with their magic nullifying rocks I’ll manage just fine. Stop worrying, I’ll come back in one piece and you can continue fantasizing over my perfect form as usual.” You reply.\n\nGikil knows it’ll be pointless to talk you out of anything, so he just nods at your other orders to continue gathering sacrifices and takes his leave. As for you, you gather your own forces and make your way to the dero enclave.\n\nWhen you get within sight of the gates, you find them predictably closed. Though apparently you were expected.\n\n“So you’ve finally come to finish us off then? I suppose I’m glad you decided to at least do it in person.” You hear a voice shout from the battlements. It’s Marzost.\n“I’m actually only here for your crystals, but if you don’t want to put up resistance for them, I’m more than willing to spare your rock eater lives.” You say.\n“You’ve already killed us, with your new deal, but we can discuss that when you get inside if you wish. Hold on I’ll open the gate.”\n\nYou’re a little surprised at how this is going. Some of your men say it could be a trap, and you’ve already taken that into consideration, but you’re not getting the impression it is. Marzost has always been fairly straightforward with you.\n\nThe gates open and your forces march in. When you step inside you’re only greeted by Marzost who is now wearing traditional dero armor minus the helmet. The community looks desolate.\n\n“Hello Mistress. Even with death draining all the life out of this world, your beauty is not tarnished. I consider it a blessing that your image will be one of the last things I see before I die.”\n\nWell Marzost hasn’t changed. You clearly won’t have to fight at all, but now you’re curious of what’s going on here.\n\n“Things have changed here Marzost.”\n“Indeed they have, I can explain if you’re interested. But you said you needed our crystals did you not? You can gather as many as you need over by the archway. We don’t need them anymore after all.”\n\nYou tell your people to go fill up their bags with the crystals. You mention you’ll be fine and soon it’s just you and Marzost. He stands silently admiring you.\n\n“So Marzost, where is everyone?” you ask.\n“Mostly dead. A large group of wraiths attacked us last month and did significant damage before we were able to destroy them. A lot harder to fight the incorporeal undead rather than the walking corpses. Some of us still live, but they’re all mostly guarding the nursery and spending what little time remains with the last children of our race. I suppose it would all just be easier for us to do what most of the dero did and just surrender to death, but the last of us have decided to not make it easy.”\n\nYou nod.\n\n“I can respect that I suppose.” You say.\n“I am glad to have earned some of your respect.” Marzost replies.\n“So when did you figure out that our deal was no longer in effect? One of your fellows from the surface find out to tell you somehow?”\n“Not at all. The demon Big Red, the one you made a new deal with, told me.”\n\nPart of you is slightly surprised, but given that Gikil told you Big Red approached him as well, you suppose it isn’t too shocking.\n\n“He actually appeared to you? When he said he was going to observe you, I figured he meant from a distance.”\n“He did a little more than that. He offered us a deal too, well he tried anyway.”\n“He offered a way to escape, I’m guessing.”\n“Something like that, though apparently our mere existence offended him so much he didn’t stick around too long. I know we’re not most aesthetically pleasing of races, but come on. We managed to disgust a demon? Our race really must be cursed by the gods.”\n“Given what Big Red said about you lot, he practically claimed you were. Mentioned you lot didn’t have souls. He said he couldn’t even detect your blood or life force.”\n“Hm. Interesting, I what that means when we die, do we truly just go to oblivion rather than an afterlife?”\n“Probably.”\n“Well I suppose rotting in the ground isn’t as bad as whatever eternal tortures await in a hellish realm or wherever the morally lacking go. Good thing for the dero too, our race has not been a kind one. Still, I’m wondering…”\n“Wondering what?”\n“We can’t ALL be soulless. During Big Red’s visit, he pointed to one of our buildings and said he’d make a deal for all the people he detected in it. He said he could give us safe passage through his realm.”\n“What was the building?”\n“The nursery. Though we’d never mentioned that to him.”\n“You had svelk breeders though in it didn’t you? Maybe that’s what he was detecting.”\n“Couldn’t be. They were all dead by the time Big Red showed up. The only ones in there were our young and the dero nursemaids.\n“Hmm, must be because they had svelk blood. You did tell me that mixing with our race was having an unexpected affect on yours.”\n“Perhaps. In any case we have a lot of faults, but not protecting our children isn’t one of them. We declined and he was about to propose another deal, but stopped mid sentence, turned up his nose and soon left. Guess he realized it was useless to try to bargain.”\n“So how many babies do you have?”\n“Why do you want to know?”\n“Because that red bastard told me I need to hand over a thousand svelk souls to him and mentioned yours weren’t suitable since you didn’t have any. Apparently he’s lied to give me more work than necessary.”\n“So… you were planning on wiping us out eventually.”\n“It was always a possibility.”\n“Well I guarantee we don’t have nearly that many young to supply you with, though I hope it won’t be necessary to defend them against you.”\n“You’re going to have to defend them against the undead eventually.”\n“True, but…and this is foolish idealism I suppose, I was at least hoping our last encounter with each other wasn’t going to end in bloodshed.”\n“And what were you hoping for Marzost? That I’d profess my undying love for you and we’d skip off happily into the sunset together like in some sickening human children’s story?”\n\nMarzost chuckles.\n\n“No Mistress, nothing so optimistic. I’m well aware of how you think of me. However, despite my obvious feelings for you, I have to say I’m a little disappointed in your recent actions.”\n“Oh? By what exactly? That wiping your community out was always on the table? Taking your crystals by force?”\n“That? No. I’m not disappointed by your ruthlessness. Indeed its one of your attractive traits. I’m not even disappointed that you broke the deal you had with us, your people and you in particular have a certain reputation. I’m just a little more disappointed by who you broke our deal with. I mean to throw away our plan on a demon’s offer? I would have thought you to be more savvy than to trust what Big Red told you.”\n\nYou believe this is one of the rare times Marzost has displayed a negative view of you. In fact it may even be the first.\n\n“What deal I made or didn’t make with Big Red is of no concern to you. I’m not here to fit whatever odd pedestal you’ve put me on.”\n“Well you’re correct about the second part. But not about the first. While I know you haven’t exactly done any binding agreement yet, I am aware that he’s set you up to fail. There is no way you’re going to make the quota for a thousand souls before death takes this world. He’s betting you’ll get desperate enough to give him the hundred plus yours. He wants yours soul very much, he told me himself about how yours is one of the darkest he’s encountered in awhile and getting yours would be quite the prize and worth the time to linger on this world a bit longer. This does concern me since I know that YOU are determined to not fall into such a trap which means being desperate for souls. The dero children by the svelk have souls and they will NOT be sacrificed to a demon for any reason.”\n\nMarzost steps forward while looking up at you.\n\n“Mistress, we’ve had minimal contact and you loathe me, but know that my love for you is genuine. I’d explain it, but you wouldn’t understand and wouldn’t care anyway. Just know this though; I will defend the last dero children from damnation, no matter how much I love you. If there is ANY part of you that feels compassion or even just mercy. Do not carry out what you’re pondering. The number of children wouldn’t noticeably help your soul count anyway. You have the crystals, just leave us to die on our own terms.”\n\nMarzost then touches your hand.\n\n“That’s three.” You say, while moving it away.\n",
  "page 69": "You’re not going to make the quota in time. Big Red gave a task he knew you’d fail so you’d get desperate and end up signing the contract for the other deal.\n\nYour better plan is to wait for the baby and shore up what remains of your defenses against undead attacks so you can survive to be rid of the spawn and use its blood as a loophole for the contract.\n\nYou don’t have too many other options.\n\nTR 12\n\nYou look out the window and see the land barely clinging to life. You think there might be a patch of grass that’s still green and a small tree in your immediate area, but that’s about it. It’s a good thing you’ll be getting out of here soon. Reports of some robed wraith like figure have recently been sighted on the continent. The being just kills anything living that’s near it. It doesn’t even have to do anything.\n\nYou can only guess it ‘s the same being that killed Francis based on what Belina told you last year. Seems like a lifetime ago though.\n\nHonestly it probably was a good thing you stopped sacrificing svelk and trapping their souls when you did since it seemed to slow down the undead incursions at least in the short term. Maybe you were indirectly pissing off the Death God trapping souls like you were.\n\nAs you move away from the window, you hold your baby close to you, which is grabbing at your tits to suck on.\n\n“Don’t worry little one, mommy will make your death quick. And your death will be helpful mommy too, which already makes you more useful than my pathetic daughter ever was. I suppose you deserve one last meal though. Drink deeply.” You say clutching the child and allowing him to feed.\n\nAs the baby drinks his last, you grab your dagger from your bed table. When he seems to be finished his eyes are closed looking completely content. If he hasn’t gone to sleep immediately, he’s well on his way.\n\n“Oh you males. You get what you want, and then fall right to sleep don’t you?” you say bringing the dagger up closer to the child.\n\nBefore you strike, you’d be lying if things were different, there’s a part of you that would be curious to actually try to raise this one. Maybe you’d get a competent one this time. Then you shake your head smiling.\n\n“No, he wouldn’t even exist in any other situation and even if he did, he’d just grow up to be another disappointment, like all children I raise. Goodbye son.” You whisper and slash open the baby’s throat. It makes nothing but a gurgling noise and just bleeds out like a stuck pig.\n\nYou quickly gather the blood (which is now all over the top part of you) in a nearby bottle that was also on your bed table.\n\nYou fill it up and then wrap up the baby’s bloody body in more blankets. You then call for Arrak who comes in soon after.\n\n“Yes Mistress?” he asks, not batting an eye at the bloody bundle in your arms.\n“Take this and dispose of it how you see fit.” You say and hand off the corpse to him.\n\nArrak takes the dead baby and leaves without saying another word.\n\nYou never did bother to tell Arrak he was the father, you aren’t sure if he ever suspected, but he never addressed you about it. Either he didn’t want anything to do with it anyway, or more correctly believed that if you really wanted him to be involved, you would have told him.\n\nWasting no more time you immediately go to the table where Big Red’s contract still lays. You look it over again and see it’s changed slightly from the first time you looked over it last year. Typical infernal contract, always with the loopholes.\n\nBig Red probably didn’t think you could read infernal and granted you don’t understand all the words which could be enough to doom you. However, you’ve made your play and just hope you don’t damn yourself.\n\nYou take a quill, dip it in your baby’s blood and write your signature. No sign of Big Red yet, but you imagine it won’t be long. You start to become very nervous, as you’ve made this final gambit a reality.\n\nBig Red suddenly appears.\n\n“Ah, so you have made your decision. Good thing too, I can already tell this world is nearly at its end. Or at least this continent. In any case, I trust you have the hundred souls?” Big Red says.\n“A few more than a hundred actually, but I imagine you already KNEW I wasn’t going to make a thousand in time.” You say.\n“Well I wouldn’t be good at my job if I couldn’t judge these things. I do thank you for the extra souls though.”\n“The souls are in the chests over there.” You say pointing to a couple of them against the wall.\n“Excellent, I’ll just take a look and we’ll soon be on our way.”\n\nBig Red goes over to the chests and opens them. He then turns to you.\n\n“Looks good, now I need to just look over the contract just as a formality. I have to say Semra, I’m looking very forward to all the time we’re going to soon be spending together.”\n\nYou wait as Big Red reads over the contract. He this looks up and smiles causing your heart to sink. You knew it was a long shot, but somehow you thought you’d still win.\n\nYou maintain your composure, but you actually feel mildly sick at the reality of the situation.\n\n“Nice try, but while the blood of your baby makes the contract valid, it doesn’t make you exempt from our deal. I see Gikil talked you into my plan.” Big Red says.\n“Ah, of course. Your plan. I knew he couldn’t have come up with that idea himself.” You reply.\n“Honestly, I’m surprised it worked since I’m equally surprised you were foolish enough to listen him. Where is Gikil anyway, I would have thought he’d want to be here to gloat about how he saved his worthless hide by selling you out.”\n“He’s been dead for months.”\n“I see. Did you kill him after you mated with him?”\n“No, he died in battle. The baby wasn’t even his.”\n“Interesting. Well I suppose this has gone even better than expected. Now I don’t have to honor my agreement with him. So I suppose there’s nothing left now then to get on with honoring the rest of this contract, though I have another question which is do you really want to go through with it?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well I mean you know I already have a claim on your lovely soul and I could just kill you now if you wish to get the waiting over with for the both of us. It’s a win-win really, you don’t have to wait with the doom of going to hell forever looming over your head and I will be in a much more generous mood about your…situation.”\n“How generous exactly?”\n“Let’s just say, you wouldn’t be just a form a prized piece of currency to be used up or even a personal source of enjoyment, I’d actually consider you something a lesser advisor on certain plans I have. I would be most interested in hearing your insight on some matters.”\n“That is a very generous offer, but considering you’re a demon, well I’m sure you understand if I don’t quite believe you.”\n“What is there to gain by lying? Granted I could be, but I see no reason to as I already have your soul. Whether I wait for you to die or you agree for me to kill you right now makes little difference in the scheme of things. Just remember though, I may not be as generous later.”\n\nYou gambled and lost; now you’re getting the chance to gamble again. Big Red is probably getting a big kick out of playing this game with you especially now that he’s all but won, but there really isn’t anything you can do now except keep playing it or surrender to him completely and hope he’s telling the truth.\n",
  "page 62": "You’ll be a withered looking crone before you let Marzost inject you with whatever his drug is. Maybe it works now, but who knows in another few months? She could be melted into a pile of goo or something.\n\nOf course in a few months, you ALL might be dead, so you still need to get your shit together. Maybe you can mix up your own enhancement potions. You generally have always hated doing alchemy, but at least you know what you’re putting into your body and that it’ll work as intended.\n\nThat’ll have to wait though; you’ve got another day of demon capturing ahead of you. Joy.\n\nYou head down to the dero community and see Marzost already there paying visit. He’s really got it bad given that you’re not even looking your best anymore, then again you’re still more of a prize than any of the squat creatures the dero call females.\n\n“Greetings Mistress, even under all this duress you still manage to retain your elegance.” Marzost says.\n“Hrm. Actually I’m glad to see you, well glad might be stretching it, but I did need to discuss something.” You say.\n“What’s that?”\n“Just that I won’t ever be taking that drug even with your test subject showing no negative effects.”\n“But…I mean I could test another….”\n“No. Not sparing yet another svelk female. I’m already hated enough by that half of the population. We also don’t have the time and I’m just not going to risk it. My mind is made up. I’m well aware of my condition though and I plan on making my own potions to boost my endurance.”\n\nMarzost exhales and nods.\n\n“Very well Mistress. I trust that you know your body best.”\n“Indeed. And I request that you to put down the test subject since she isn’t needed anymore and all she keeps doing is escaping and apparently threatening to kill me.”\n“I suppose so, seems like a waste of scientific study though.”\n“You want to focus on something to research? How about figuring out how to close the portal after we’re on the other side of it. Now leave me, I got important shit to do.”\n\nMarzost takes his leave and you get on with the business at hand.\n\nSeveral days pass and you’ve managed to capture one more demon in that time, though you still haven’t had time to get around to making those potions. For one thing, you’re too exhausted to set everything up, for another; a lot of the ingredients are back at your fortress. You sent some of your people to fetch them, but things have been held up due to a large number of undead gathering in the area. Gikil predictably failing to keep up on things as usual.\n\nYou get prepared for another day as usual, but as you’re doing so, something feels slightly amiss.\n\nAt first you just believe it to be you being exhausted as usual. But then out the corner of your eye you see something in your room and almost dodge the attack in time.\n\nAlmost.\n\nYou fall to the floor with a knife in your neck looking up at the one who did it. It’s the damn test subject Marzost was SUPPOSED to kill. Looks like he never got around to it.\n\nThe fool was probably hoping you’d change your mind and was keeping her for ongoing observation just in case. One thing is for sure, that drug really worked on the test subject since you didn’t see or hear her until it was too late.\n\nYou can’t even form an insult since you’re too busy choking on your own blood and gurgling.\n\nThe test subject doesn’t take chances that you might be able to save yourself somehow or call for help and stomps on your face repeatedly until its caved into mush and your brains are leaking out your ears.\n\nNot a pleasant death, but what awaits you in the afterlife is even less pleasant.\n",
  "page 61": "Fuck it; you don’t have much to lose at this point.\n\nYou head down to the dero community and are glad to see Marzost is already at the summoning place for a change.\n\n“Marzost, just the dero I wanted to talk to. Get that concoction of yours, I’m ready to take the risk.” You say.\n“I have one right here!” Marzost says pulling out metal syringe from his one of his deep pockets.\n“Hm, Of course you do. Well let’s get this over with.”\n\nMarzost looks a bit hesitant at first. You then realize why.\n\n“For fuck’s sake, yes you have permission to touch me THIS time. Just make sure your hands don’t wander where they don’t need to.” You exclaim.\n“Very well Mistress.” Marzost says and walks over to you.\n\nMarzost pats your arm a couple times and runs his hand over it. You’d be more revolted, but you’re honestly too tired. You’d probably be more nervous about all this, but again, you’re just too damn tired to give a fuck anymore.\n\nHopefully, that’s all about to change.\n\nMarzost injects the purple liquid into your arm, which feels like hot oil going into your veins.\n\n“SHIT! FUCK!” you shout and pulling back barely allowing time for Marzost to pull the syringe out.\n“Easy Mistress. It had that effect on the other girl too at first, but it goes away once the drug settles.\n“Shit! I feel like my insides are burning!”\n\nYou feel your heart racing faster and you actually crumple to your knees. Your warriors try to assist you, but you tell them to just get back. Marzost stands by continuing to tell you, it’ll only last a little bit longer.\n\nJust when you think the pain is going to get worse, it completely stops and you feel more energetic. Like a lot more.\n\nYou exhale and stand back up without much effort.\n\n“Feeling better Mistress?” Marzost asks.\n\nBefore you can answer your head explodes.\n\nThen the rest of your body follows.\n\nMarzost and the others just stand there in shock for a few minutes covered in your bloody remains, which are all over the place. Such are the risks of only using one test subject as a example of the effects of an experimental drug.\n\nDoesn’t take long before the svelk start blaming Marzost, which in turn causes the dero to become defensive, and violence ensues between the groups.\n\nAll of this doesn’t really matter to you though because you’re dead. The only good thing is it was quick.\n\nWhat awaits you in the afterlife isn’t quick however.\n"
