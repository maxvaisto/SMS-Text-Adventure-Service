{"page 123":"\"Please don\u0027t mind the words of my companions, their humor can come off as quite rude now and then. Come join us for a drink.\" These accommodating words, together with an imitating glare at your companions, quickly resolve the brewing tension.\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\"Ha ha! I must admit, I originally didn\u0027t look too fondly on a group of knights from Lorimur, but all things considered you\u0027re not that bad,\" laughs Fladius with a bottle of wine in his hand. \"Quite shortsighted of me, to wish to blame you for the overbearing behavior of your nation. You must also be powerless to change anything.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, we\u0027re only a few chess pieces in the larger game,\" do you sigh. Well, you\u0027re not exactly lying, a king or a queen can also be considered a chess piece. Only some chess pieces are far more important than others. But there\u0027s no need to correct Fladius misunderstanding, so you keep that to yourself.\n\n\n\"Well the past is the past, nobody can change it,\" says Fladius, while he changes the subject. \"I came here to remind everybody again about the greatness of my order, its honor still needs to be defended on a tourney such as this. Besides, I must admit that the reward money is quite attractive too. Since I can\u0027t demand anything from the poor and helpless, I\u0027m a bit tight on funds. And I wish to avoid getting again in a situation, where I\u0027m outnumbered while my sword breaks! Ha Ha! Let me tell you all about it! It was only a few months ago...\"\n\n\nThen Fladius begins bragging about the countless adventures and ordeals he went through, it\u0027s fun to listen to such an avid storyteller. He\u0027s got quite the imagination and his attention to the small details is amazing too!... At least that\u0027s what you think when your questions keep getting fairly realistic and precise answers. After emptying a few glasses of wine, Fladius takes his leave. Then a frightening possibility suddenly comes up in you, it\u0027s ridiculous and far-fetched by any means. But what if, Fladius wasn\u0027t bragging at all? What if, he was speaking the truth all along? It did sound awfully convincing and Orlag can confirm some points in his story. That would imply that Fladius experienced more in a single month than you in your entire life!\n\n\nSlowly you look around at your companions and now you\u0027re not so sure anymore, they\u0027ll be able to win against opponents of that kind of caliber. And it seems they have their doubts too because Hallas promptly proposes to... alter your chances of victory a bit.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

At least on the surface. Most people are too afraid to oppose you and you\u0027ve got the entire city in the palm of your hand. But the most extreme individuals amongst the rebels are in hiding. From the shadows, they fiercely continue to resist you.\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\"...We could extinguish the fire quickly enough this time, unlike the one in the warehouse and almost all of the horses are fine...\" Orlag is currently reporting about the arson in the stables. Together with the other attacks, it\u0027s already the third one in this week alone. Slowly their guerrilla attacks eat away at the strength and morale of your troops.\n\n\n\"Damn it, so unfair! Only we have the right to fight dirty!\" yells Hallas angry. If there were rules about fighting dirty, it wouldn\u0027t be called dirty or unfair anymore.\n\n\n\"Those cowardly rats! If they would only show themselves to me just once, I would crush them all in one fell swoop!\" claims Bomboulos, while hitting the table with his fist. Well your soldiers would do the crushing and he would just be cheering from the sidelines, but that\u0027s only a minor detail.\n\n\n\"Yes, we\u0027re stronger than them, so we should win by default!\" whines Tyrwill. Honestly, you\u0027re not really sure, if she understands the concept of guerrilla-warfare. While Fariera is quietly staring at the map of Valinor on the table, lost in her own thoughts. Since none of your companions is capable of thinking up any good idea\u0027s, you\u0027ll have to think up something resembling a plan.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

But perhaps it\u0027s for the best that you take your leave, we have still some important matters to discuss,\" do you say.\n\n\nFladius only smirks contemptuously and crosses his arms before his chest. \"Oh? Or perhaps the \u0027great knights of the Golden Sun\u0027 find it offensive to be in my presence. If I\u0027m not mistaken, your order hails from Lorimur, right? It seems the rumors are true, its knights are as overbearing as the nation they serve. But a knight needs to have the ability to back up his or her words. So if you want me to leave, make me leave!\"\n\n\nIt turns out that was exactly what you were going to do. What you just said was only the polite form of, \u0027Throw the beggar, that\u0027s pretending to be a knight, out!\u0027 But why does Fladius seem to be acting under the assumption, that you\u0027re going to lower yourself and do it personally? Luckily the guard, who entered together with Fladius, ends the silly misunderstanding by placing his hand on Fladius shoulder. \"The young lady, doesn\u0027t wish to be disturbed anymore.\"\n\n\n\"Ha ha, It seems the great knights of Lorimur aren\u0027t capable of doing anything by themselves. One wrong word and their lackey jumps in,\" laughs Fladius, while he coldly glances at the soldier behind him.\n\n\n\"How difficult...,\" mutters Bomboulos. \"You might be unaware, but that\u0027s only a measure to keep the riffraff at bay. Unlike you, we can\u0027t afford to waste too much of our valuable time on pointless duels. So we have a \u0027gatekeeper\u0027 to weed out the unworthy challengers. Defeating him can be considered the entry bar, to be allowed to issue a challenge towards us.\" Quite a good excuse, but he \u0027accidentally\u0027 forgot to mention this \u0027entry bar\u0027 is one of your elite soldiers. A warrior trained with the sword from his childhood early on, by the finest instructors of the royal family.\n\n\nSo when Fladius nods and agrees to the proposal, you can already foresee the insolent beggar-knight getting beaten to a bloody pulp. \"Then it\u0027s settled, knight Fladius will duel him, in order to receive the right to challenge any one of us.\"\n\n\nYou and the other knights accompany them outside, it\u0027s going to be a spectacle nobody wants to miss. Outside the tent, a circle of spectators has formed around the two contestants. \"It will be a match in swordsmanship and will continue until there\u0027s a clear winner or one of the two parties surrenders.\" After all, if they stopped at \u0027first blood\u0027 the likelihood of an unfortunate \u0027accident\u0027 would be somewhat lower. On your signal, the match begins.\n\n\n\"Ha ha! Come at me, ill-mannered lackey! I have other \u0027great knights\u0027 to challenge after dealing with you,\" laughs Fladius, while he confidently provokes the soldier.\n\n\nThen your guard slowly approaches him and then suddenly lunges forward, while his sword makes a large downwards swing. It seems he immediately makes a mistake, he almost loses his balance and leaves his left flank open. Luckily Fladius doesn\u0027t seem to be that skilled and he fails to exploit the opening. In fact, he even jumps backward, while quickly raising his sword. All in all, it\u0027s not that spectacular, you would probably have done better.\n\n\n\"Ha ha, you surely showed me!\" laughs Fladius. \"Well it\u0027s my own fault for looking down on you, so I can hardly blame you for using such an exaggerated move to fool me. I assumed you were just a lackey and ended up underestimating you, but you gotta work on your acting skills. Nobody would be stupid enough to fall for such an obvious false opening!\"\n\n\nThe guard only coldly smiles and skilfully rotates the sword in his hand. The next instant his sword shoots out lightning quick, almost like a snake, but Fladius manages to deflect it. Then they exchange a fury of blows, you can barely follow what\u0027s happening. Then both fighters take their distance again as if they\u0027re slowly scanning their opponent for any possible weaknesses. It\u0027s quite surprising, it seems they\u0027re equally skilled. Not that much of a problem by itself, but the fact remains you didn\u0027t see through the faint at first glance. Slowly you peek out of the corner of your eyes at Bomboulos, to check if you were the only one that didn\u0027t see through it. Judging from his bulging eyes and wide open mouth, the answer is no.\n\n\nThe match continues intensely for a few more minutes before it\u0027s finally decided. Although Fladius receives a bloody cut on his arm, he manages to disarm the guard. After his victory, he has now earned the right to challenge you. Curse Bomboulos and his stupid idea. This has gotten pretty troublesome because you\u0027re not 100% sure you would win. Luckily... or should we say \u0027unfortunately\u0027, he has received an injury. \"Congratulations Sir Fladius! But I see you received quite the nasty cut, that means our match will have to wait until you have fully recovered. My honor wouldn\u0027t allow me to challenge somebody when he or she isn\u0027t in perfect condition.\" Since you\u0027re exploiting the \u0027fair play\u0027 card, he has no other option than to agree. After the match is concluded he leaves.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Hallas is busy whispering something against two masked people. Then he points towards Fladius departing back and slowly drags his thumb across his throat. He\u0027s probably telling them, that they should help Fladius shave, how unexpectedly kind of him. You always thought Hallas was quite the narrow-minded type.\n\n\nThen Fariera appears beside you and whispers in your ear, \"Your Highness, although I don\u0027t mean to belittle your abilities, perhaps we should try to... slightly adjust our odds in this tourney.\" Everything else considered she\u0027s got a point.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

What remained of their great invasion force, quickly retreated over the border. Karadas has begun to fortify itself to withstand a possible retaliation. Now that Karadas has holed itself up, Lorimur can slowly increase its advantage using the battle of Valinor as a springboard. Triumphant you return to the capitol of Lorimur, where your father awaits your return. Under loud cheering of the citizens and with the banner of the Golden Sun high, you proudly ride through the streets. That evening, there\u0027s a grand banquet and countless guests are invited from across the whole world. Okay not the whole world... Only the kingdoms that can feel Lorimur looming over them and want to make a fine impression, but admiring you is the main reason they came. During which, Bomboulos demonstrates to everybody how you dealt with Karadas, if they imagine the buffet is the army of the enemy for a second.\n\n\nThen your father confirms your position as the sole heir to the throne and announces it officially. With your great military merits, nobody would dare to question your claim. Valinor has been peacefully integrated into Lorimur under your leadership, the hero of Valinor. And Karadas has suffered a painful setback, further establishing Lorimur\u0027s might. With you as its queen the future of the kingdom looks more promising than ever before.\n\n\n-------\n\n[POV Switch]\n\n\n\"Please your highness, hurry!\" begs the servant his master.\n\n\n\"Stop whining!\" do you say. Honestly it was never supposed to get so out of hand. You were only cracking a joke when you were yelling, \u0027Attack! Kill them all!\u0027 Why did everybody have to take you so bloody serious? They all took their weapons and charged, without thinking it over for a single second. Your \u0027just kidding\u0027 was completely drowned out by their battle-cries, the clashing of weapons and the screams of the dying and wounded. And when finally everything calmed down, nobody could appreciate the joke anymore. All they could say, \u0027Lorimur\u0027s royalty is full warmongering lunatics, we should have known!\u0027 Like any of this is your fault to begin with! \"Besides why the heck do they take the orders of a princess so seriously?\"\n\n\nThen the nearby servant sighs inaudably and looks a the unruly heir to the throne. \"Your Highness, please remember that Her Majesty once achieved a great military victory when she had your age.\" Then he informs the guards of your arrival and you enter a large throne room. There high and mighty, under a giant banner with a golden sun on it, sits the Queen of Lorimur. Your mother\u0027s stern gaze in her blue eyes makes you swallow all the excuses you were going to spout.\n\n\n\"My daughter, to ensure that Lorimur remains ever strong. I shall entrust you the task that was once given to me, become a knight and spread your name across the land. Your good-for-nothing friends can join you.\" says the Queen. Then she directs herself towards the servant. \"Inform the city-state of Zolanor, that the lords of the land are on their way.\" Then an ironic smile appears on the face of your mother.\n\n\nAnd so everything begins anew, history will repeat itself... Oh, perhaps Her Majesty can already hear the peasants wail in horror and despair.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

The grass field has been enclosed by a wooden fence for this occasion and the audience can stand behind it. Of course, the more important people can sit on a wooden tribune, with a splendid view. For a moment you wish you could sit over there as well, in a large comfortable chair with a cup of tea. But unfortunately you\u0027re a participant at the moment, so your chair has been placed on the grass field and therefore you don\u0027t enjoy such a good view.\n\n\nThe archery competition is first, then the horse race and finally the duels. The heralds start with announcing who\u0027s going to participate, so it\u0027s a tad bit boring. Of course, as soon as you\u0027re announced, all the peasants release a deafening cheer. Countless mugs are raised to encourage you. Well, most of the other participants are only here to make up the numbers, so you\u0027re not really paying that much attention to them. But there\u0027s one odd name that draws your attention, Iselda Esendal, isn\u0027t that one of the major nobles? These days, literally anybody can call himself or herself a knight.\n\n\nThe first part of the competition begins. First, they shoot at standing targets, then moving bags of sand, and finally from horseback. It started off a bit chaotic. Certain participants suddenly went missing, bowstrings abruptly broke and some arrows were strangely distorted. One of the referees was even found dead, nobody had seen a thing. Some knights suddenly got sick through food poisoning, while others seemingly barely put in any effort and widely missed the targets. Probably the weight of the gold crowns in their pockets dragged them down at the crucial moment. While your knights had chosen to wear full body armor and closed helmets for the occasion and look, Bomboulos suddenly lost a few hundred pounds and grew a bit! And their accuracy was far better than you could ever have anticipated. There was even a last minute adjustment to the rules, which allowed the use of crossbows. So you ended up using one. Some of your soldiers were even attentively enough to adjust the special shooting platform, where it was attached to.\n\n\nThe result was obvious You got first place, while the rest of your order claimed the second, third place and so on. Only Orlag didn\u0027t do as good, he ended up at the 45th place. Orlag claimed that archery never was his forte.\n\n\nNext was the horse race, from the starting line until the finish, ten kilometers further. It went exactly the same way as the archery competition. Some horses got suddenly sick or threw their riders off. There was even a short argument about the location of the finish line. It was changed at the last moment, to also include a return trip and a group of trustworthy referees would verify if all contestants passed the midway checkpoint. Your group was lagging behind a bit and then decided to turn back. Luckily the referees mistakenly assumed, you had passed the midway point. There were some complaints about people who claimed they didn\u0027t see you overtake them. But they quickly got in some kind of fistfight with some ruffians, so they\u0027re probably only saying such nasty things to cause trouble.\n\n\nAnd unsurprisingly the results were more or less the same as in the first part of the competition. The knights of the Golden Sun easily claimed the first six spots as the unquestionable winners. But it was somewhat of a surprise to see Iselda claim the seventh place. She hatefully glared at the rightful winners, probably out of petty jealousy.\n\n\nWith this, the first day of the competition comes to an end.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

(15)\n","page 246":"[POV switch]\n\n\nAll those who dare to stand up against Lorimur or the knights of the Golden Sun will soon learn the price of their foolishness. With the suffocating grip of their iron fist, they have always squashed any who ever stood in their way and they\u0027ll always continue to do so. Now that their leader has steeled her heart and given the orders, the small city-state of Valinor will pay in blood.\n\n\n--------\n\n\nAn angry crowd has formed itself on the city square, pitchforks, cudgels, scythes, and other farming tools, are raised into the air. A burly man jumps on a carriage and yells towards the crowd. \"People of Valinor! These despicable bandits, who call themselves \u0027knights\u0027 have defiled our beloved Valinor! Since when was the stench of the corpses, of the innocents they executed, normal? Do you believe the hundreds of poor souls hanging from the gallows, are criminals? For what? Looking at those murderers in the wrong way? Saying something that displeased them? Throwing a stone and making a dent in their precious armor? Since when have we stopped to raise any questions when somebody gets tortured or executed? These monsters have twisted our city beyond all recognition!\"\n\n\nHis voice thunders over the masses, and the masses answer him back with a deafening roar. With tears in his eyes, the man continues. \"Will we just stand by and watch? See how our brothers, sisters, parents and loved ones are brutally snatched away from us?\"\n\n\n\"No! No! No!\" chants the crowd. The tumult of their makeshift weapons echoes through the whole square.\n\n\n\"As long as justice and freedom still hold any meaning to you, then fight! Together we can do it! As long as we stand together, we can slay the beast!\"\n\n\n\"Yes, free Valinor from this never-ending nightmare!\" yells a middle-aged woman. \"Storm the castle!\" yells another man. \"Those monster won\u0027t take a single child of mine anymore,\" screams a woman. Madness is visible in her eyes.\n\n\nThen a young woman with an icy cold look in her eyes arrives at the square, seated on a magnificent horse. With her hair as radiant as the sun, she looks like an angel, who has descended in the mortal realm. But her beauty fails to conceal the horror beneath it. \"A group of stray peasants, who have forgotten their places, how pitiful. No need for any mercy, clean them all up.\" Slowly she raises her arm and gives the signal to attack, to the hundreds of cavalry soldiers behind her. Once they receive the command, they immediately ride past the woman and charge at the crowd. Their lances pierce through the unlucky ones at the front. The ones that fall down get crushed by the hooves of the horses and with their swords they begin to hack into the crowd.\n\n\nPeople scream as the soldiers slaughter their way towards the man on the carriage. A few quick-witted peasants, try to flee from the square. But their path gets blocked by the soldiers of the garrison. They form multiple shield walls, to block all nearby streets and so close off any possible escape routes. While dozens of guards armed with crossbows, appear on the rooftops of the nearby houses. Without a shred of hesitation, they start shooting at the fleeing people. Nobody will escape, everything will be wiped clean in a sea of blood. Once the agonized screams finally quieten down, the massacre is over.\n\n\nBut it\u0027s too soon, for the young ruler to celebrate. Everywhere in the city, the flames of the rebellion have been lit. Even the most cowardly peasant grabs a kitchen knife or tool. If they don\u0027t fight today, will they ever see hope again? The bloodbath at the city square becomes the symbol of Lorimur\u0027s oppression and the Innocent\u0027s who died in it become martyrs. In the face of the combined wrath of the people, there\u0027s no other choice but to flee. Perhaps due to her excessive pride, the young knight has forgotten, that this is Valinor and not Lorimur. There are simply not enough soldiers present to make the people accept such tyranny. So while the garrison tries to... hold out as long as possible, the knights of the Golden Sun flee the city.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

First, they shoot at standing targets, then moving bags of sand, and finally from horseback. Although it\u0027s quite an exciting competition, the results of your knight order are downright disastrous. It turns out, Tyrwill never even once used a bow in her whole life and she was stuck figuring out how the arrow would fit on it. Fariera stole almost all the hearts of the men present away, as she beautifully drew her elegant and delicate bow. Unfortunately, the refined piece of art ended up snapping in two, when she applied too much force on the bowstring. Hallas performed the best of them all, but unfortunately he \u0027accidentally\u0027 leaned too far over the line and used a crossbow, which was against the rules. So he was disqualified. Didn\u0027t he listen, when you said, \u0027We\u0027re going to compete fairly?\u0027 Anyway, Bomboulos was the icing on the cake when he tried to fire of solid golden arrows with his golden bow. Let\u0027s just say, that it was far less practical than he had originally envisioned. Only you and Orlag more or less managed to produce an acceptable result. But compared to the rest of your rivals, it was severely lacking.\n\n\nThe result was obvious You ended at place 183, Orlag at 187th and the rest of your order was drop dead last. Orlag claimed that archery never was his forte.\n\n\nNext was the horse race, from the starting line until the finish, ten kilometers further. It went exactly the same way as the archery competition. Although you and your knights posses the finest horses in all of Lorimur, you were all a bit lacking on the riding skills aspect. Fariera even rode on the most elegant horse of them all, with an exeptionally graceful pace. It would have looked great in a procession, but it wasn\u0027t exactly the fastest horse around. In fact, some enthusiastic peasants overtook her on foot. Tyrwill tried her best, but she fell off her horse a mere hundred meters into the race and was carried off. Even now you still don\u0027t know what went trough Bomboulos mind. He decided to wear his lucky charm made out of solid gold, his slippers and his saddlebags filled with snacks. It only ended up increasing the massive weight of Bomboulos, the walking treasure chest, even further. He was also the only one, that seemed to be surprised that his horse never reached the finish line. To make matters even worse, you received multiple complaints about Hallas and his aggressive riding style during the race. It seems he drove a few contestants from the road with his six-span war-chariot. Also since only a single horse was allowed, he was disqualified once again.\n\n\nAnd unsurprisingly the results were more or less the same as in the first part of the competition. You ended at place 123, while Orlag at 76th and the rest of the order didn\u0027t even manage to finish the race and weren\u0027t counted anymore. Surprisingly Iselda somehow ended up winning this part of the competition. Her provoking smile was somewhat annoying, but you weren\u0027t in the position to retort much.\n\n\nWith this, the first day of the competition comes to an end.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

You sigh and close the window. Then you walk towards the rest of your knight order for a toast and a well-deserved victory banquet.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nFinally, the peasants of Valinor have accepted you as their eternal overlord... protector. Of course, there are still a few who have their doubts. But you have guest rooms to spare inside the dungeons and lots of interrogators that are just sitting there, twiddling their thumbs.

Most are anxiously wandering around, while some of them are curled up in a corner, crying in misery. The great nobles are arguing like always and half of the city guards and their hired mercenaries have mysteriously disappeared since yesterday. In short, they\u0027re getting nowhere and they all furiously rush off to do what they think is best.\n\n\nLater that day, Sarokar, Morvir, and Hallas are caught red-handed while trying to flee through a secret passage.

Morvir and Sarokar are both executed for high treason, which at least solves a part of the issues.

Countless mugs are raised to encourage you. Well, most of the other participants are only here to make up the numbers, so you\u0027re not really paying that much attention to them. But there\u0027s one odd name that draws your attention, Iselda Esendal, isn\u0027t that one of the major nobles? These days, literally anybody can call himself or herself a knight.\n\n\nThe first part of the competition begins. First, they shoot at standing targets, then moving bags of sand, and finally from horseback. It started off a bit chaotic. Certain participants suddenly went missing, bowstrings abruptly broke and some arrows were strangely distorted. One of the referees was even found dead, nobody had seen a thing. Some knights suddenly got sick through food poisoning, while others seemingly barely put in any effort and widely missed the targets. Probably the weight of the gold crowns in their pockets dragged them down at the crucial moment. While your knights had chosen to wear full body armor and closed helmets for the occasion and look, Bomboulos suddenly lost a few hundred pounds and grew a bit! And their accuracy was far better than you could ever have anticipated. There was even a last minute adjustment to the rules, which allowed the use of crossbows. So you ended up using one. Some of your soldiers were even attentively enough to adjust the special shooting platform, where it was attached to.\n\n\nThe result was obvious You got first place, while the rest of your order claimed the second, third place and so on. Only Orlag didn\u0027t do as good, he ended up at the 45th place. Orlag claimed that archery never was his forte.\n\n\nNext was the horse race, from the starting line until the finish, ten kilometers further. It went exactly the same way as the archery competition. Some horses got suddenly sick or threw their riders off. There was even a short argument about the location of the finish line. It was changed at the last moment, to also include a return trip and a group of trustworthy referees would verify if all contestants passed the midway checkpoint. Your group was lagging behind a bit and then decided to turn back. Luckily the referees mistakenly assumed, you had passed the midway point. There were some complaints about people who claimed they didn\u0027t see you overtake them. But they quickly got in some kind of fistfight with some ruffians, so they\u0027re probably only saying such nasty things to cause trouble.\n\n\nAnd unsurprisingly the results were more or less the same as in the first part of the competition. The knights of the Golden Sun easily claimed the first six spots as the unquestionable winners. But it was somewhat of a surprise to see Iselda claim the seventh place. She hatefully glared at the rightful winners, probably out of petty jealousy.\n\n\nWith this, the first day of the competition comes to an end.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

(5)\n","page 248":"[POV Switch]\n\n\n\"...Their arrogance and cruelty have grown to unseen heights! Do they think themselves unassailable? High and mighty, elevated above all?\" screams Iselda, as she hits the table. Her cheeks are red and her eyes are burning with anger. At the moment the three great nobles are gathered together in a secret meeting hall, to discuss the current threat that Valinor faces. It\u0027s no bandit gang this time, or an enemy hiding in the shadows. Quite the opposite, they\u0027re arrogantly sitting in the daylight, doing as they please. The decadent and domineering knights of the Golden Sun, who\u0027re acting as if they own the place.\n\n\n\"I know, I know! They\u0027re not even bothering anymore to put up a false front of courtesy or righteousness,\" says Bartolomeus dispirited. The last few months have taken a heavy toll on him. \"But what can we do? We only hold power on paper. In reality that despicable rogue Elsia calls the shots.\"\n\n\n\"She doesn\u0027t command the hearts of the people! They think they have the right to deny us our freedom, well they\u0027re dead wrong. I say, why would we stand by and watch? Let\u0027s take up the sword and challenge those beasts!\" yells Iselda. An inner fire seems to have been lit inside her.\n\n\n\"And here the child is spouting nonsense again. We\u0027re not up against some kind of man-eating ogre out of a fairy-tale, that can be defeated by \u0027courage\u0027 and \u0027friendship\u0027. We\u0027re up against the knights of the Golden Sun, with more than two thousand soldiers at their back and call.\" Sarokar laughs mockingly while playing around with his dagger. \"I think it\u0027s time to wake up and face reality, we can\u0027t do shit against such power.\"\n\n\n\"So you would have us cower? Live in shame and fear? Desperately praying we won\u0027t offend the great knights?\" ask Iselda sharply.\n\n\n\"Great or not, the mighty Lorimur has their backs. Who could oppose them?\" laughs Sarokar.\n\n\n\"We could,\" says Bartolomeus suddenly. \"Iselda is right, they\u0027ve crossed the line. If we don\u0027t choose to face them, we can only live like rats. So I\u0027m with you, we\u0027ll show them the resolve of the people of Valinor. We won\u0027t tolerate their tyranny for a single moment anymore.\"\n\n\n\"Ha ha!, I think you\u0027re mistaken,\" laughs Sarokar. \"You won\u0027t \u0027live\u0027 like a rat, you\u0027ll die like one!\" Then he jumps up and throws his dagger at the center of the table. \"I think their treason has been proved right, lord Hallas?\"\n\n\nThen the doors fly open and dozens of soldiers, bearing the crest of Lorimur, enter the room and surround the nobles. Then an arrogant young man walks in. \"Yes, more than enough. You did well, my friend.\" Then he mockingly gazes at the two rats. \"Only a slight push was required and look how eager you all rushed towards your deaths, like moths to the flame.\"\n\n\nIselda throws herself at Sarokar with a furious scream. The soldiers can just barely preventing her from cutting off his head and manage to subdue her. Sarokar tumbles down and frightened touches his throat, where a bloody cut has formed. He goes pale and scurries further back. Then Bartolomeus coldly says one word to him, \"Why?\"\n\n\nSarokar shivers as he lies on the floor, then a glint of madness appears in his eyes. \"Y-You h-have n-no idea against who you\u0027re up against! No idea at all! Lady Elsia, is no ordinary knight... her power and status are far beyond your comprehension. So resisting? You have to be out of your mind!\"\n\n\n\"Indeed, the leader of my order, will one day become the sun in the sky. All shall bask in her eternal glory and cower before her endless might,\" says Hallas, as he casually waves his hand. \"Take them away.\" Then he helps Sarokar stand up. \"With this, we\u0027ll be able to swiftly rile up and finish off any possible rebellion. Your contribution won\u0027t be forgotten by Her Highness.\" Then he pats him on the back. Although the order of the Golden Sun didn\u0027t do anything noteworthy this time, it\u0027s the result that counts, reasons Hallas.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

The grass field has been enclosed by a wooden fence for this occasion and the audience can stand behind it. Of course, the more important people can sit on a wooden tribune, with a splendid view. For a moment you wish you could sit over there as well, in a large comfortable chair with a cup of tea. But unfortunately you\u0027re a participant at the moment, so your chair has been placed on the grass field and therefore you don\u0027t enjoy such a good view.\n\n\nThe archery competition is first, then the horse race and finally the duels.

First, they shoot at standing targets, then moving bags of sand, and finally from horseback. Although it\u0027s quite an exciting competition, the results of your knight order are downright disastrous. It turns out, Tyrwill never even once used a bow in her whole life and she was stuck figuring out how the arrow would fit on it. Fariera stole almost all the hearts of the men present away, as she beautifully drew her elegant and delicate bow. Unfortunately, the refined piece of art ended up snapping in two, when she applied too much force on the bowstring. Hallas performed the best of them all, but unfortunately he \u0027accidentally\u0027 leaned too far over the line and used a crossbow, which was against the rules. So he was disqualified. Didn\u0027t he listen, when you said, \u0027We\u0027re going to compete fairly?\u0027 Anyway, Bomboulos was the icing on the cake when he tried to fire of solid golden arrows with his golden bow. Let\u0027s just say, that it was far less practical than he had originally envisioned. Only you and Orlag more or less managed to produce an acceptable result. But compared to the rest of your rivals, it was severely lacking.\n\n\nThe result was obvious You ended at place 183, Orlag at 187th and the rest of your order was drop dead last. Orlag claimed that archery never was his forte.\n\n\nNext was the horse race, from the starting line until the finish, ten kilometers further. It went exactly the same way as the archery competition. Although you and your knights posses the finest horses in all of Lorimur, you were all a bit lacking on the riding skills aspect. Fariera even rode on the most elegant horse of them all, with an exeptionally graceful pace. It would have looked great in a procession, but it wasn\u0027t exactly the fastest horse around. In fact, some enthusiastic peasants overtook her on foot. Tyrwill tried her best, but she fell off her horse a mere hundred meters into the race and was carried off. Even now you still don\u0027t know what went trough Bomboulos mind. He decided to wear his lucky charm made out of solid gold, his slippers and his saddlebags filled with snacks. It only ended up increasing the massive weight of Bomboulos, the walking treasure chest, even further. He was also the only one, that seemed to be surprised that his horse never reached the finish line. To make matters even worse, you received multiple complaints about Hallas and his aggressive riding style during the race. It seems he drove a few contestants from the road with his six-span war-chariot. Also since only a single horse was allowed, he was disqualified once again.\n\n\nAnd unsurprisingly the results were more or less the same as in the first part of the competition. You ended at place 123, while Orlag at 76th and the rest of the order didn\u0027t even manage to finish the race and weren\u0027t counted anymore. Surprisingly Iselda somehow ended up winning this part of the competition. Her provoking smile was somewhat annoying, but you weren\u0027t in the position to retort much.\n\n\nWith this, the first day of the competition comes to an end.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

A malicious group of dissidents has been causing mischief, in order to destabilize the proper functioning of this city. Such actions and behavior are completely intolerable. That\u0027s why the leader of the knight of the Golden Sun, Her Ladyship Elsia, has come to the difficult decision to implement martial law over Valinor. All to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its citizens. This means that Her Ladyship has been requested to assume full and complete authority over the city, in order to protect the people until this crisis has been resolved. In her immeasurable generosity and admirable sense of duty, Her Ladyship has agreed to assist us during these difficult times.\"\n\n\nA sage-like, well-dressed man, shakes his head when he hears the herald. \"Aren\u0027t these just fancy words for usurping Valinor completely? This crisis is thanks to the behavior of these knights.\"\n\n\n\"In her all-encompassing wisdom Her Ladyship has drafted a few new rules and asks the citizens to bear with any unfortunate inconveniences they might cause. First, there will be a curfew, from 10 o\u0027clock nobody may be on the streets anymore without explicit permission. Second, unauthorized gatherings of more than 8 people are strictly forbidden. Third, public speakers must have their speeches approved by Her Ladyship herself. Fourth, unless you\u0027re under the service of Her Ladyship, carrying weapons is illegal. Fifth, it won\u0027t be possible to leave or enter the city without a permit. Finally, anyone who breaks any of these rules will be severely punished. This also applies to anyone who offers a criminal any assistance or who\u0027s aware of someone else breaking the rules and fails to report it.\"\n\n\nThe sage can no longer contain himself. \"T-This is absurd! Valinor has always been a free city...\" Then two soldiers come forth, grab the old man and drag him towards the stage. \"Unhand me! You have no right!\"\n\n\n\"Ah, it seems one of those atrocious criminals has already been caught,\" says the herald as he watches the man being dragged on the platform. His hands are tied behind his back and a noose is put around his neck. \"People of Valinor! This rioter has attempted to disrupt your peaceful lives, so he\u0027ll be put to justice!\" Then one of the soldiers kicks the stool away from under the old man\u0027s feet. \"Her Ladyship guarantees you, that she will do everything in her power to safeguard Valinor\u0027s peace, safety and prosperity!\" Then with a nauseating crack, the old man\u0027s neck breaks. A warning to all those that would try to foolishly resist.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

If it turns out this sort of competition isn\u0027t your kind of thing, then just drop it. Spout some excuses, about insufficient time to prepare, or some very important matters urgently requiring your attention, or just being too lazy to even care and be done with it. Well, that last part may be the truth actually.\n\n\nAnd so the knight contest comes to an end. It\u0027s the knight tourney we\u0027re talking about here, or did you briefly confuse it with another contest? Anyway, let\u0027s settle this as a good try, which yielded you a small bit of fame.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

Do your best, for the glory of the order of the Golden Sun!\" After your statement, all the knights of your order cheer loudly. Well, in this case, they\u0027ll probably be struggling to move even a molehill. So it\u0027s pretty much a leap of faith to put your trust in them, but it can\u0027t possibly get any worse than it already is, right?\n\n\n-------\n\n\nThe following day, the second part of the tourney starts. You know, the competition where two knights try to knock each other off their horse. After they get knocked off, they switch whatever weapon they fancy and continue to fight on foot. That last part was added because most knights were unwilling to give up. So they scratched the various weapon duel and included it in the pike-stabbing-competition.\n\n\n\"Jousting, your highness, it\u0027s called jousting,\" reminds a meddlesome servant you. Anyway, it\u0027s a \u0027stab-and-bash-until-they-drop\u0027 competition and it\u0027s awfully popular for some reason amongst the knights.\n\n\nLuckily, you\u0027re not half bad when it comes to the stabbing and bashing part. You never bothered to train yourself intensely. But together with your natural talents, your equipment of clearly superior quality and considerable motivation, you manage to perform surprisingly well. It\u0027s only until you encounter Fladius in the ring, that you\u0027re defeated. His skills with the lance and sword turn out to be as impressive as he had claimed. But you\u0027re not unsatisfied, you had a great match and it proved to be a valuable experience. Afterward, he even teaches you a few handy tricks.\n\n\nBut what surprised you most of all, was what each of your companions achieved in their own odd way. Once Bomboulos managed to finally get some speed on his horse, he was more like a battering ram than a charging knight. So every match where he managed to hit his opponent through sheer luck, it was an instant victory for him. This time, wielding a golden mace wasn\u0027t that bad of an idea either. The Majority of his opponents were dragged down by their heavy armor and failed to dodge his strikes. Fariera\u0027s bewitching smile always distracted her opponents long enough for her to land a decisive blow. While she managed to demoralize the other female knights with a barrage of insults and cruel comments. Although it was quite underhanded, it wasn\u0027t against the rules and it\u0027s nothing compared to what Tyrwill did. She just threw a tantrum and every chivalrous knight had quite a difficult time in dealing with her.\n\n\nOnly Hallas didn\u0027t do as well as the others. He did manage to win a few matches, but once it came to light his opponents had been bought off, he was once again disqualified. There\u0027s also the incident where his opponent suddenly ended up with an arrow in his back. Perhaps a fight with rules simply isn\u0027t his strong point.\n\n\nSo the result was that Orlag ended up at the 12th place, you at 20th place, Bomboulos at 31st place, Fariera at 42nd place and Tyrwill at 48th place. The first place belonged to Fladius, with his skill and ability that was only a given.\n\n\nAll in all, the honor of the knight of the Golden Sun is more or less saved. You weren\u0027t the stars of the show, but slowly your name spreads across the land.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

A moment later two of your soldiers carry a young nobleman downstairs. Judging by his bruises, he probably tried to fight back, how foolish. Then he, and two servants that were apparently with him, are thrown in the mud pool near the road. Then you direct your gaze at the inn owner and send her a kind smile.\n\n\nWhen one of your soldiers flexes his fist, she finally understands it. \"My lady!

By the way, that Fozir fellow got a laboratory somewhere in the castle and immediately dove on his research. Well, he\u0027s trying to be useful. \"You see Lady Elsia, the nearby villages have been plagued by the infamous bandit Ragnar,\" says Bartolomeus.\n\n\n\"Infamous? Never heard of him,\" says Hallas, while he\u0027s poking his nose.\n\n\n\"If even Hallas doesn\u0027t know the guy he must be some nobody,\" scoffs Fariera.\n\n\n\"How many men does he have?\" says Bomboulos, while he temporarily stops eating. Yes, everybody is done eating, but he\u0027s the exception.\n\n\n\"...Uhm...We don\u0027t know exactly...enough to be a serious threat to the villages, that\u0027s all we know,\" says Bartolomeus.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t mean to belittle your problems, my lord. But even a dozen armed men can be a threat to small villages with less than a hundred peasants,\" points Orlag out. Indeed from your lessons in strategic warfare, you can still vaguely remember that Orlag is probably right. It would be stupid to only look at the raw numbers. A small village has a lot of people, who aren\u0027t suited to combat like the children, the sick and the elderly. The number of able-bodied fighters they can muster is only about 20-40% of the whole population. They also lack experience in combat and have very poor morale. Coupled with the fact most peasants have no other weapons than tools like a pitchfork, knives or an axe. So bandits slaughtering whole villages, although they\u0027re outnumbered, is not that unusual.\n\n\nBut those same bandits would be no match for a trained, well-equipped and disciplined army. Every single one of the soldiers of your personal guard can easily handle 10 of those third-rate warriors. Even if the quality of the troops here is a bit lower, they should still be easily victoriously when the size of the forces is evenly matched. It\u0027s kind of hard to believe the city can\u0027t spare a fifty or a hundred soldiers to clean this mess up. In fact, doesn\u0027t the garrison of Lorimur, to keep the situation under control, not have around 2000 soldiers stationed here? Even if they\u0027re not the sharpest blades in the sheath, cleaning up some measly bandits shouldn\u0027t be too hard, right?\n\n\n\"Not all of us can mobilize a large force whenever we feel like it,\" interjects Sarokar. \"Besides Ragnar is as cunning as a fox, he strikes lightning quick and then disappears back into the forest, like a ghost. When our men arrive, those vermin are gone with the wind. Then they strike again, somewhere else and the cycle repeats.\"\n\n\n\"Indeed it\u0027s just as Sarokar says, all of our attempts to catch him have failed. We once... requested aid from the garrison commander, but he claims he has to defend the city against possible invaders and cannot afford to \u0027spread out\u0027 his troops too much. Iselda requested we gather enough troops and comb throughout the entire forest until he\u0027s found, but we don\u0027t have that kind of manpower. We cannot conscript any farmers, taking them away from their fields in this season will have disastrous consequences for the harvest. A famine would cost a lot more lives than ten Ragnar\u0027s together.\"\n\n\n\"And he knows, that\u0027s why he\u0027s so arrogant...\" adds Sarokar. It seems the local officials are quite useless. Perhaps this is an opportunity for a knight seeking fame to help out the people in need?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: People know you, yet all too often you\u0027re seen as just \u0027an important somebody\u0027.

Every knight may pick nine peasants and then form a team to compete. It would help simulate the condition on the battlefield and prove another challenge to test a knight\u0027s ability to lead. The majority of the knights welcomed the chance, it would help to make the competition a bit more exciting than usual. Instead of seeing two people hack into each other, it would be twenty people hacking in on each other. So that means ten times the blood and thrill.\n\n\nThe only objection a few traditional knights raised was that the peasants picked by the order of the Golden Sun were a tad bit odd. They orderly marched on the field in a perfect formation and they carried their pitchforks as a soldier would carry a pike. And all they needed were small encouragements like, \"Attack!\" and \"Go get em!\", to fearlessly charge at a heavily armed knight on a warhorse. While the disorganized and cowering peasants of their opponents crumbled practically in an instant. So it mostly ended up with a group of peasants beating a knight to a bloody pulp, while a knight of the Golden Sun was cheering them on. Some even claimed that with crazy peasants like these around, knights were no longer necessary. \n\n\nFladius even angry screamed, \"Who would be stupid enough to believe these battle-hardened-veterans are peasants?!\" He probably couldn\u0027t accept his loss and chose to vent his anger.

A malicious group of dissidents has been causing mischief, in order to destabilize the proper functioning of this city. Such actions and behavior are completely intolerable. That\u0027s why the leader of the knight of the Golden Sun, Her Ladyship Elsia, has come to the difficult decision to implement martial law over Valinor. All to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its citizens. This means that Her Ladyship has been requested to assume full and complete authority over the city, in order to protect the people until this crisis has been resolved. In her immeasurable generosity and admirable sense of duty, Her Ladyship has agreed to assist us during these difficult times.\"\n\n\nA sage-like, well-dressed man, shakes his head when he hears the herald. \"Aren\u0027t these just fancy words for usurping Valinor completely? This crisis is thanks to the behavior of these knights.\"\n\n\n\"In her all-encompassing wisdom Her Ladyship has drafted a few new rules and asks the citizens to bear with any unfortunate inconveniences they might cause. First, there will be a curfew, from 10 o\u0027clock nobody may be on the streets anymore without explicit permission. Second, unauthorized gatherings of more than 8 people are strictly forbidden. Third, public speakers must have their speeches approved by Her Ladyship herself. Fourth, unless you\u0027re under the service of Her Ladyship, carrying weapons is illegal. Fifth, it won\u0027t be possible to leave or enter the city without a permit. Finally, anyone who breaks any of these rules will be severely punished.

You have no right!\"\n\n\n\"Ah, it seems one of those atrocious criminals has already been caught,\" says the herald as he watches the man being dragged on the platform. His hands are tied behind his back and a noose is put around his neck. \"People of Valinor! This rioter has attempted to disrupt your peaceful lives, so he\u0027ll be put to justice!\" Then one of the soldiers kicks the stool away from under the old man\u0027s feet. \"Her Ladyship guarantees you, that she will do everything in her power to safeguard Valinor\u0027s peace, safety and prosperity!\" Then with a nauseating crack, the old man\u0027s neck breaks.

The city is preparing itself for the coming winter. Everybody stocks up the needed supplies to make it through the coldest and harshest season of the year. The nobles clink their glasses together to celebrate a good year of trade and taxes, while the peasants are despairing how they\u0027re going to survive this time. Of course, it\u0027s the fear for an uncertain future, that drives people to do odd things. Things that are somewhat... incomprehensible for you, at least from the viewpoint of your warm and comfortable sofa. Well, they\u0027re peasants, you\u0027re never going to understand them. And like spring brings hope, autumn brings along a bunch of lunatics seeking to exploit the fear of the common man. On a certain morning, on an ordinary day, you end up running into such a lunatic.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nYou\u0027re riding on your horse through the streets of Valinor, with the rest of your entourage behind you. The weather is still nice, for this time of the year. You and your knight order went out to hunt a rumored legendary deer. But you failed to catch it since Haleth asked you to spare it. Well at least you had a nice day out. When you arrive at the city square, you spot a large crowd of people. It seems there\u0027s some kind of event going on.\n\n\nIn the middle of the crowd, there are multiple piles of wood, about two meters in height. At the peak of each pile rises a long wooden beam up. At every wooden beam, there\u0027s somebody tied up to. They are dressed in rags and look a bit odd. Some of them are screaming and begging for mercy, while others are apathetically gazing in front of them. On a platform before the pyres a fat and bald man, wearing wide red robes, looms over the crowd. The man has a fanatic look in his eyes as he gazes up and slowly spreads his arms. \"Oh let the heavens have mercy on us. Why did the fields not yield a harvest that\u0027s large enough? Why do the innocent get sick, when the cold wind blows? Why aren\u0027t we receiving the favor of the heavens?\" After an overly dramatic long pause and the man suddenly points his hand up in the air. \"I, great priest Turokal of the church of the Eternal Light, have spent countless nights searching the heavenly firmament for answers! As I tirelessly gazed at the stars, slowly a shocking answer came to me. There are some amongst us, that have displeased the heavens and earned us their wrath!\"\n\n\nShocked the crowd holds its breath, eagerly waiting for the priest to continue. Agitated Turokal walks around the stage then he suddenly turns towards the wooden piles. \"The evil and the wicked! They have unleashed hunger and sickness over the innocent! But do not despair, there\u0027s still hope for salvation. A way to make the heavens smile on us once again! We must cleanse our humble community of such individuals! And the order of the Eternal Light is the only way to fight such evil!\" Slowly the crowd gets more and more riled up and they begin to loudly agree with the priest. Then Turokal dramatically claps his hand together. \"We shall cleanse them in the holy fires, as we shall cleanse our hearts! Burn these sorcerers, light the pyres. Let it bring us warmth and the forgiveness of the heavens!\" Then an executioner steps forward to ignite the wood with his torch.\n\n\nThere\u0027s quite the farce going on, they\u0027ll probably encounter these kinds of problems every year. So that it still took \u0027countless nights of tirelessly searching\u0027 to arrive at the same answer as all the years before, could make you wonder about the competence of this priest. But it seems he\u0027s quite skilled at riling the peasants up in the yearly burn-the-witch event. Then again, it\u0027s your first time witnessing something like this. Lorimur is a strict military state and your grandfather exterminated every single church and religious cults. Some say he wanted to free the people from religious strife, while others say he simply wanted to hog all the power and influence to himself. Knowing grandpa, it was probably the latter of the two. If a king or queen wishes for an absolute monarchy, a church is nothing but an eyesore. Of course any peaceful orders that wanted to teach the people how to live in harmony with each other, got eradicated too. Your grandpa was always pretty dedicated when it came to eliminating any possible future hindrances.\n\n\nSuddenly Bomboulos rushes forward on his horse. \"Stop! Stop this at once! What do you think you\u0027re doing?!\" He\u0027s loudly screaming, while his horse charges through the crowd. You and the rest of the knights and soldiers follow behind him, albeit a bit surprised about his behavior.\n\n\nThe executioner hesitates and gazes up at the priest, who turns around to look at the person who dared to disturb them. Turokal looks annoyed at first, but when he sees that Bomboulos is a knight and an awfully rich one at that, he gets a lot more amicable. And when he sees the large group of knights and soldiers following behind him, he completely turns into a friendly and patient middle-aged man, who would gladly listen to your worries. \"Oh, my lord, I didn\u0027t see you immediately. Welcome, in our midst, your lordship! Is there anything I can help you with?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m ordering you to stop! You were going to...\" screams Bomboulos almost out of breath.\n\n\n\"Please make no mistake, these are foul demon spawn, who...\" begins the priest.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Bomboulos, while he waves annoyed at the priest. \"And you can burn them for all I care. Burning witches isn\u0027t much of a problem by itself, but burning them without my boss permission, well that\u0027s a big problem!\"\n\n\n\"Ah... your boss? But the great nobles can\u0027t do anything to me... I mean, I have the approval of the great nobles. So who\u0027s your...\" stammers the priest.\n\n\n\"Her ladyship Elsia, the leader of the knight order of the Golden Sun! You ignorant monkey! She\u0027s the one that owns the place here!\" snarls Fariera. It seems your fellow knights are more concerned about his actions challenging your authority than the witches involved. Although he\u0027s by no means a threat to somebody like you, if such cults are not handled properly they tend to become quite the pain.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

With the suffocating grip of their iron fist, they have always squashed any who ever stood in their way and they\u0027ll always continue to do so. Now that their leader has steeled her heart and given the orders, the small city-state of Valinor will pay in blood.\n\n\n--------\n\n\nAn angry crowd has formed itself on the city square, pitchforks, cudgels, scythes, and other farming tools, are raised into the air. A burly man jumps on a carriage and yells towards the crowd. \"People of Valinor! These despicable bandits, who call themselves \u0027knights\u0027 have defiled our beloved Valinor! Since when was the stench of the corpses, of the innocents they executed, normal? Do you believe the hundreds of poor souls hanging from the gallows, are criminals? For what? Looking at those murderers in the wrong way? Saying something that displeased them? Throwing a stone and making a dent in their precious armor? Since when have we stopped to raise any questions when somebody gets tortured or executed? These monsters have twisted our city beyond all recognition!\"\n\n\nHis voice thunders over the masses, and the masses answer him back with a deafening roar. With tears in his eyes, the man continues. \"Will we just stand by and watch? See how our brothers, sisters, parents and loved ones are brutally snatched away from us?\"\n\n\n\"No! No! No!\" chants the crowd. The tumult of their makeshift weapons echoes through the whole square.\n\n\n\"As long as justice and freedom still hold any meaning to you, then fight! Together we can do it! As long as we stand together, we can slay the beast!\"\n\n\n\"Yes, free Valinor from this never-ending nightmare!\" yells a middle-aged woman. \"Storm the castle!\" yells another man. \"Those monster won\u0027t take a single child of mine anymore,\" screams a woman. Madness is visible in her eyes.\n\n\nThen a young woman with an icy cold look in her eyes arrives at the square, seated on a magnificent horse. With her hair as radiant as the sun, she looks like an angel, who has descended in the mortal realm. But her beauty fails to conceal the horror beneath it. \"A group of stray peasants, who have forgotten their places, how pitiful. No need for any mercy, clean them all up.\" Slowly she raises her arm and gives the signal to attack, to the hundreds of cavalry soldiers behind her. Once they receive the command, they immediately ride past the woman and charge at the crowd. Their lances pierce through the unlucky ones at the front. The ones that fall down get crushed by the hooves of the horses and with their swords they begin to hack into the crowd.\n\n\nPeople scream as the soldiers slaughter their way towards the man on the carriage. A few quick-witted peasants, try to flee from the square. But their path gets blocked by the soldiers of the garrison. They form multiple shield walls, to block all nearby streets and so close off any possible escape routes. While dozens of guards armed with crossbows, appear on the rooftops of the nearby houses. Without a shred of hesitation, they start shooting at the fleeing people. Nobody will escape, everything will be wiped clean in a sea of blood. Once the agonized screams finally quieten down, the massacre is over.\n\n\nBut it\u0027s too soon, for the young ruler to celebrate. Everywhere in the city, the flames of the rebellion have been lit. Even the most cowardly peasant grabs a kitchen knife or tool. If they don\u0027t fight today, will they ever see hope again? The bloodbath at the city square becomes the symbol of Lorimur\u0027s oppression and the Innocent\u0027s who died in it become martyrs. In the face of the combined wrath of the people, there\u0027s no other choice but to flee. Perhaps due to her excessive pride, the young knight has forgotten, that this is Valinor and not Lorimur. There are simply not enough soldiers present to make the people accept such tyranny. So while the garrison tries to... hold out as long as possible, the knights of the Golden Sun flee the city.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

Considering that this place is severely lacking compared to your father\u0027s royal palace, it\u0027s still surprisingly fun. Perhaps the best thing is that this castle doesn\u0027t belong to your father. Okay \u0027officially\u0027 it belongs to the nobles here, but in reality, it belongs to Lorimur. So it\u0027s your father\u0027s property in a certain way, but he isn\u0027t here. Here nobody tells you what you should or shouldn\u0027t do. Okay, they do, but you can completely ignore it and pretend they didn\u0027t say anything. It\u0027s a new kind of freedom, and frankly said, you begin to like the taste of it.\n\n\nSo life is good and well, but also a tad bit boring. Perhaps the time has come to do what knights usually do? Whatever that may be... \"Does anybody know what a knight usually does?\"\n\n\n\"Uh... eating and killing bandits of course!\" says Bomboulos. He isn\u0027t completely wrong, but you\u0027re pretty sure that \u0027eating\u0027 isn\u0027t something exclusively for knights. And besides, after that \u0027Ragnar problem\u0027, you have had it with bandits for now. Speaking of eating, his new squire Haleth has gained considerable weight since you rescued him. He\u0027s following Bomboulos around lately while wearing golden slippers as well. Sometimes you\u0027re afraid you have created a \u0027Bomboulos junior\u0027. Let\u0027s just hope it never comes to that.\n\n\n\"Defending the helpless and innocent?\" proposes Tyrwill.\n\n\nLuckily Fariera quickly points out the problems in her suggestion. \"That\u0027s only a \u0027guideline\u0027 not an activity by itself.

And those who were whining about \u0027unfair\u0027 and \u0027unequal treatment\u0027 got thrown out by your guards, who were deeply offended by these false accusations. So at the moment, the Golden Sun is the only knight order present in the entirety of Valinor. Well, it\u0027s not that big in the first place, it\u0027s already too small for just the six of you!\n\n\nBut a tourney, although it might sound a bit cliché, it might increase your fame substantially.

Just like the knights of the Golden Sun!\"\n\n\nThen the smile on his mothers face freezes, but since she can\u0027t bring herself to tell her child the truth, she only shakes her head. \"Who knows, sweetie... but there are many other knight orders, it doesn\u0027t have to be...\"\n\n\n\"Yes, but none of them is as cool as the order of the Golden Sun! Besides aren\u0027t they the only knight order still left in the kingdom? They\u0027re the only ones still bravely defending everybody!\" His mother can only gaze back at him, her eyes are filled with sadness. Then they hear loud noises from outside, it seems there some kind of procession moving through the streets. The boy excitedly rushes towards the window and leans over the windowsill. \"Look, mom! It\u0027s the knights of the Golden Sun!\"\n\n\nOn the streets of the capital, the crowd stands respectfully at the sides of the road while a long procession passes by. Hundreds, no thousands of heavily armed knights orderly ride through the streets, the sunlight reflected on their full-body armor. In complete silence they ride on their horses, they completely ignore the people on the streets. Above their razor-sharp spears, flutters a giant flag. On the flag, there\u0027s the image of a golden sun, but it has changed during the recent years. Its golden color has dimmed, like a merciless desert sun, it gazes down on the knights. Its blood red rays give off the impression as if it wishes to announce its dominance over the whole world. In the midst of the procession, rides an enormous carriage. It\u0027s a luxurious and splendid vehicle, but the golden decorations give of the same eerie impression as the flag and each of the twelve horses that pull it, have a glint of madness in their eyes.\n\n\n\"G-Get inside, now!\" yells the mother, while she drags her struggling son inside. After casting a fearful glance at the sea of sharps spears points that pass by and the imposing carriage, she quickly slams the window shut. There\u0027s a reason all the other knight orders were disbanded, the word \u0027knight\u0027 with its once noble meaning has slowly gotten a different meaning in Lorimur... It now means \u0027death\u0027. These knights aren\u0027t going to save or defend anyone. This procession only means one thing, soon an ocean of blood will flow and a mountain of corpses will be raised. Inside the carriage is their sole ruler, Her Majesty Elsia, Queen of Lorimur and soon another nation will bow before her never-ending hunger for power. She\u0027ll never stop, she\u0027ll never rest until the entire continent has fallen beneath her merciless conquest. How long will other kingdoms, like Karadas, be able to resist such a horror?\n\n\nThe woman quietly shivers in fear and grips her son even more tightly. It seems she\u0027ll have to tell her child soon, that the order of the Golden Sun solely serves the high and mighty. Its only purpose is to further expand Her Majesty\u0027s power and slaughter all who would dare to get in the way.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

How you blatantly ignored his orders, broke the rules of the trail, abused your royal authority and brought your own personal guard along. The list of misdeeds you have committed, during your stay in Valinor, is almost enough to make him faint. Furiously he roars through the royal halls, that such a dimwit that thinks royal decrees are toilet paper is unworthy as an heir and he promptly disinherits you. The throne of Lorimur will never be yours and one of your cousins steals your spot.\n\n\nOn the bright side, your father must admit, you do have some skill in handling peasants. After Lorimur annexes Valinor, he gives it to you as a fief. Although a meager reward for somebody who hoped to be queen, it\u0027s an extremely large fief for a knight. Obviously, the rest of the gang, who have committed the same crimes as you, are sent along with you. Together you return to Valinor. So that\u0027s your fate now, to spend the rest of your days as the lady of the land.\n\n\n-------\n\n[POV Switch]\n\n\nA few years later, the city-state of Valinor has grown quite a lot during the recent years. The population has increased and the travelers and merchants visiting the city, have become more numerous. The only odd thing is, that gradually all the minor nobles have disappeared. So did the influential and rich merchants and other people of significant status. Some whisper that the knights of the Golden Sun have cleaned house and are slowly increasing their power and influence even further. Their spies see and hear everything, nobody dares to stand in their way or question their tyrannical rule. Of course all of the extra wealth, the city has gained the recent years, has all flowed into the pockets of the upper class. Which only consists out of the knights of the Golden Sun and nobody else.\n\n\n\"Well how the high and mighty play their games, has nothing to do with common folk like us,\" mutters the village elder, while he walks through the village. He has finished inspecting the fields and is very pleased with what he saw. He estimates they\u0027ll have more than enough to make it through winter this year. That\u0027s how the common folk live, day by day, year by year. A strange harmony between man and the four seasons.\n\n\nThen a young boy comes running towards the old man, he looks panicked. How come? There has been no sign of bandits. \"Elder! Elder! Soldiers are coming!\" Along with the words of the boy, a cologne of armored cavalry enters the village and all the villagers throw themselves on the ground. While he runs towards the soldiers, the village elder begins to fear for the worst. Soon his fears are confirmed as he sees a magnificent carriage, with golden decorations and inlaid with rubies and gems, pulled by twelve horses, appear between the soldiers. A golden sun is painted on the door of the carriage. This makes his blood freeze and sends the chills down his spine, it\u0027s no longer certain they\u0027ll be able to make it through winter this time. Shaking in fear the village elder kneels on the ground and bows his head.\n\n\nEverybody is terrified because they know the lady of the land has arrived.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

How long can this desperate resistance postpone the inevitable? Although the assault has momentarily been halted to give the tired soldiers of Karadas some rest, they\u0027ll soon begin again. Around you, injured people are pleading for help, others are transporting materials to repair the damages or are looking for somebody that has gone missing. Valinor is about to crack. Slowly you must admit that Valinor might indeed be doomed and that your dreams of greatness, will forever remain nothing but a dream.\n\n\nThen suddenly the sun appears from behind the clouds and its blinding light illuminates the city, the plains, the army of Karadas and the army marching behind it. For a brief moment everybody panics, has Karadas received even more reinforcements? \"Damn it all!\" screams Bomboulos. \"The reward is doubled, no 10 gold crowns for each dead soldier of Karadas!\"\n\n\nThen you can recognize the banner of Lorimur, above the second army.

You must admit, that his bruised and beaten face is a lot more pleasing to look at than that empty mask.\n\n\nThe captain of your personal guard steps forward and summarizes what they managed to get out of them. \"My lady, the plague was a plot hatched by the filth of Karadas. The alchemist brewed a poison that could imitate plague symptoms. Baron Clevis of Karadas, set up this whole play. He disguised himself as a Silent Watcher and slaughtered the village to the north. He then attacked the merchant ship and let it drift in our direction. After his spies here confirmed who went aboard, they poisoned them first by mixing it in their food and drinks. Afterward, they gradually expanded their scope, to emulate the spread of a plague. Their goal was clearly to cause unrest in Valinor and destabilize your rule.\" After taking a quick look at the alchemist, that\u0027s almost wetting himself, Dovar continues. \"Mister Nervel has also been kind enough, to give us both the poison and the antidote.\"\n\n\nSo our baron Clevis is the \u0027official\u0027 ring leader and the true face hiding beneath the mask of the herald of death.

But they\u0027re not exactly as impressive as you had hoped. Perhaps the minstrels simply lack the talent and creativity to sing praises about your drinking knight order, who are sitting on their bums.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

I\u0027m bearing a message from Lady Elsia. Her Ladyship has discovered an utterly despicable plot against the innocent people of Valinor! The feared plague is a hoax! A mere sham!\" The herald pauses for a moment to let his words sink in.\n\n\n\"The evil and twisted minds in Karadas never rest in their sick desire to make the innocents suffer. Thanks to their foul tricks, a poison was mistaken for a plague. Luckily Her Ladyship ever at work for the wellbeing of the people, has foiled the despicable ploy of the enemy, with Her superior intellect and near-bottomless wisdom.\"\n\n\nThen to make everything clear to even the dumbest peasants, who\u0027re asking for proof of the great deeds. One by one the patients, who have been cured by the antidote, step up on the stage and tell the people their story. Gradually everything fits nicely together and the rage of the people builds up. Finally, to top it all off, the herald announces the execution of the offenders. Under loud booing, baron Clevis is dragged on the stage while it rains rotten fruit.\n\n\nAfter all of them are executed in a bloody fashion, the crowd erupts in a loud cheer. \"Long live Lady Elsia, praise the order of the Golden Sun.

How long can this desperate resistance postpone the inevitable? Although the assault has momentarily been halted to give the tired soldiers of Karadas some rest, they\u0027ll soon begin again. Around you, injured people are pleading for help, others are transporting materials to repair the damages or are looking for somebody that has gone missing. Valinor is about to crack. Slowly you must admit that Valinor might indeed be doomed and that your dreams of greatness, will forever remain nothing but a dream.\n\n\nThen suddenly the sun appears from behind the clouds and its blinding light illuminates the city, the plains, the army of Karadas and the army marching behind it. For a brief moment everybody panics, has Karadas received even more reinforcements? \"Damn it all!\" screams Bomboulos. \"The reward is doubled, no 10 gold crowns for each dead soldier of Karadas!\"\n\n\nThen you can recognize the banner of Lorimur, above the second army. It seems words of your deeds has spread across the lands. Your father has prematurely decided to end your quest and send an army to help pressure Karadas. You know that this is an ideal opportunity, the enemy is tired and trapped between the walls of Valinor and the encroaching army. It\u0027s time to deal a grievous blow to the enemy. You quickly order to send instructions to the army of Lorimur with flag signals. Your orders are clear, attack immediately. You push the tired defenders back into action and then the slaughter begins.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nMere moments later the camp of Karadas is burning and chaos spread through their ranks as Lorimur\u0027s cavalry charges them from behind. Slowly they\u0027re driven in the direction of the walls, where the arrows and boiling oil awaits them. Soon the desperate resistance crumbles and it turns in to a complete rout. \"Drive them towards the Valis!\" do you command as you ride out at the head of your knights. When it comes to hunting down fleeing enemies, your knights have no equals.\n\n\n\"Ha ha! Leave some of them for me! I bet a hundred gold coins I\u0027m going to hit that commander over there!\" yells Bomboulos, as he hops up and down on his horse while trying to aim his crossbow. Of course, anybody who agrees now is going to get rich quickly. His arrow flies through the air and hits... another soldier, by sheer dumb luck. \"That was intentional, totally intentional!\"\n\n\nWhile Fariera has a somewhat sadistic smile on her face, Tyrwill is busy complaining. \"Why are they running so fast? Now we have to ride even faster to catch up to those meanies, can\u0027t they slow down a little?\"\n\n\nFinally, Hallas tops it all of while riding his war-chariot, he slices through their ranks like a knife through butter. Okay, he\u0027s not steering, one of his henchmen is taking care of that. He\u0027s also not shooting anybody, again it\u0027s his two subordinates that are doing that. He\u0027s just maniacally laughing and... cheering them on? Anyway, he\u0027s really good at it.\n\n\nNot long later, the survivors surrender and victory shouts are ringing in your ears. \"Victory!

A great honor has been bestowed on all of you. The privilege to attend the grand tourney of Valinor, organized by the glorious knights of the Golden Sun themselves.

Therefore many knights flock towards Valinor, along with merchants and over-excited peasants. The merchants smell money and business opportunities and the peasants... have come to cheer, while dreaming about being a knight one day. Of course, only the knights, the lords of the lands, may participate. Just imagine a contest where any random nobody could participate, how ugly would that get. But those miserable dregs of society deserve some entertainment too once in a while... before they return back to their shacks to toil away in the dirt. They have been allowed to cheer you on.\n\n\nIn almost no time, a huge tent encampment sprouts on the plains outside Valinor. Countless banners of minor nobles rise above the tents. The majority of them are unimportant nobodies with no spectacular history or adequate wealth and power. It did surprise you at first, but then you remembered. Technically every knight can be more or less considered as being part of the nobility and can their own family crest. Anyway, with the countless, knights, merchants, peasants and the occasional thief, the tent encampment has become something akin to a small bustling town.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nYou and the rest of your order, are currently hard at work preparing for the tournament that will soon start.

A cup of tea in your right hand and the rest of your friends sitting at your side. Supervising how verything progresses is a far more tiring task than you initially anticipated. Luckily there\u0027s a ring of soldiers surrounding your tent, in order to keep the upstart knights and other annoying people at bay.\n\n\nThen one of your servants enters, bows deeply and presents you the planned program for the tournament. It\u0027s the usual archery competition, horse racing, and the knightly duels thing, the one where you use your lance for something else than roasting meat above the campfire. Then announcing you... ahem, the still completely \u0027unknown\u0027 winner as the undisputed champion. You\u0027ll... ahem, the champion will receive 1000 gold crowns as a reward and then everybody can go back home. That said, is there anything you would like to add?

They cut the man, hanging from the tree, loose and gather the other corpses to bury them. In the solemn silence, Bomboulos doesn\u0027t even dare to mention his sore butt again. You\u0027ve always lived sheltered and protected in the palace, safe from any harm. Although you have heard and read about the cruelty in the world, it was always so distant... never this close. Never this...real. It\u0027s a painful realization, perhaps you should treat the common people with a bit more respect in the future. They got it much harsher than you could ever imagine.\n\n\nThen you hear that your soldiers found a lightly injured boy hidden in the rubble. He looks famished and his straw blond hair is a mess. His clothes are in tatters and he gazes at you in fear. \"Don\u0027t be afraid, we won\u0027t hurt you.\" You\u0027re unusually kind all of a sudden, perhaps it\u0027s the sudden shock of seeing a village in such a state.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m Haleth...Uh... miss, they...they killed my mom. She said I should hide in the secret storage room, where we normally hide the supplies when the evil men come...\"\n\n\nConfused you look at your companions. What are those evil men? Then Hallas clarifies, \"The tax collectors, all honest folk know how to avoid them.\" If we\u0027re talking about people that need their food to survive, he\u0027s probably right. But you get the impression that Hallas is somehow including himself with the \u0027honest folk\u0027 and that seems to be a bit too far fetched. But since this is not really relevant for the matter at hand, you gesture to the boy that he can continue his story.\n\n\n\"...While I hid there, I heard them kill everybody in the village... I was too scared to move, even when mom was...was...\" The words seem to get stuck in the boy\u0027s throat, but then he calms down. \"But I overheard their leader, he was called Ragnar, converse with the rest of those despicable people. They\u0027re going to pretend to head south, but they\u0027ll change direction and head west to attack the village of Dreine. Please punish those evil people!\"\n\n\nNow you can outsmart Ragnar and prevent tragedies like this from happening in the future. But what to do with the boy? He\u0027s an orphan with no possessions and he\u0027s still too young to provide for himself. Then you suddenly get a great idea. There somebody around here with more than enough time and money. \"Bomboulos, why don\u0027t you take this brave child as your squire?\" It\u0027s time that he sees the error of his ways.\n\n\n\"Eh??

If my memory serves me correctly, there\u0027s no queen anymore in Culin. Because it got annexed last year by Lorimur, after an incident with that insolent diplomat and the honorable crown princess. So the \u0027kingdom\u0027 of Culin, can now better be described as a \u0027province\u0027 of Lorimur.\" Then she quickly cast an amused glance at you, it seems she\u0027s enjoying herself.

So all you got is a dirty scrap of paper that tells us you\u0027re an honored member of an order that doesn\u0027t exist anymore. Haha, then it might as well read, Fladdy the honored squire of the beggar\u0027s order!\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re wrong!\" yells Fladius. \"I\u0027m fully aware of what happened to my kingdom and my order, but you don\u0027t understand it, do you? My kingdom is not a king or queen, or some name on a map. It\u0027s the people, the kind and hardworking folk, that define whether a nation exists or not. Call it whatever you like, but in the hearts of the people, the kingdom of Culin still exists. And as long as I hold true to my vows, the honor of my order will never fade.\"\n\n\n\"Pff, if a nation isn\u0027t on the map, it doesn\u0027t exist!\" laughs Tyrwill. \"And does that mean you\u0027re the last of your order?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m a free knight now and through me, the ideals of my order live on for all eternity,\" says Fladius, while he narrows his eyes as he looks at Fariera and Tyrwill.\n\n\n\"Ha ha, what a farce!

(25)\n","page 241":"[POV switch]\n\n\nYou\u0027re standing on the highest balcony, located near the top of the keep, and coldly you gaze down on the city. The rest of your order stands behind you, idly staring at you together with the garrison commander and the captain of your personal guard. \"Why?\" you ask emotionless, but nobody present answers you. \"Why did it come to this?... Answer me!\"\n\n\n\"Iiii!\" screams Morvir, who was nervously moving his weight from his one leg to the other. He\u0027s clearly clueless about what to do. \"Eh... my lady, I\u0027m afraid your popularity with the people is... slightly lacking at the moment. Of course, that\u0027s because those foolish peasants are simply unable to comprehend your greatness! There\u0027s absolutely nothing wrong with your actions or decisions filled with your bottomless wisdom...\"\n\n\n\"Silence!\" After a sudden surge of anger, you calm down again and place your arms behind your back. \"I require no excuses! All of you, make yourself useful just once in your lives and try to come up with a solution.\"\n\n\nWhile Morvir is desperately trying to think up a solution to please you, Bomboulos shrugs and walks forward. \"Calm down, boss. We\u0027ll just do what Lorimur always has done with disobedient peasants... This little kingdom will either have to break or bow.\"\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s try not to go overboard, shall we?\" says Fariera. \"But I agree the lower classes need to be taught a lesson. I suggest we place the entire city under martial law.\"\n\n\nReally? Can\u0027t we just hide in our rooms until every bad thing just... goes away?\" asks Tyrwill, while she drops her shoulders and makes a pitiful expression.\n\n\n\"Ahem I think Lady Tyrwill meant, that we should fortify our defenses and focus on security, while we wait until the unrest dies down,\" says Orlag. He\u0027s pretty naive sometimes. You\u0027re pretty sure, Tyrwill said exactly what she thought and waiting until it all calms down by itself isn\u0027t an option.\n\n\n\"We could do all of that...,\" says Hallas, on a tone that suggests he clearly disagrees. \"Or we could avoid getting our hands dirty. We could use somebody who wasn\u0027t completely satisfied even before we arrived and together we might be able... to round up the other dissidents.\"\n\n\nBomboulos rolls with his eyes, clearly annoyed. \"Why do you always talk in such a roundabout manner and never get to the point.\" Although it seems he just didn\u0027t understand Hallas intro very well, he\u0027s got a point.\n\n\n\"Ha ha, recently during our friendly gambling matches, I got on good terms with one of the major nobles around here. With some persuasion, he might be convinced to switch sides...,\" explains Hallas slowly and you start to lose your patience too. \"I\u0027m talking about Sarokar, one of the three great nobles.\" After seeing your glare Hallas finally spits his idea out.\n\n\nWell, they all gave their more or less useful suggestions, now it\u0027s up to the person in charge to decide what to do.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares. (-4235)\nPopularity: Most peasants speak about you in a positive light, no bribing required. (45)\n","page 362":"The enemy has been stopped for now, but for how long? How long can this desperate resistance postpone the inevitable? Although the assault has momentarily been halted to give the tired soldiers of Karadas some rest, they\u0027ll soon begin again. Around you, injured people are pleading for help, others are transporting materials to repair the damages or are looking for somebody that has gone missing. Valinor is about to crack. Slowly you must admit that Valinor might indeed be doomed and that your dreams of greatness, will forever remain nothing but a dream.\n\n\nThen suddenly the sun appears from behind the clouds and its blinding light illuminates the city, the plains, the army of Karadas and the army marching behind it. For a brief moment everybody panics, has Karadas received even more reinforcements? \"Damn it all!\" screams Bomboulos. \"The reward is doubled, no 10 gold crowns for each dead soldier of Karadas!\"\n\n\nThen you can recognize the banner of Lorimur, above the second army. It seems words of your deeds has spread across the lands. Your father has prematurely decided to end your quest and send an army to help pressure Karadas. You know that this is an ideal opportunity, the enemy is tired and trapped between the walls of Valinor and the encroaching army. It\u0027s time to deal a grievous blow to the enemy. You quickly order to send instructions to the army of Lorimur with flag signals. Your orders are clear, attack immediately. You push the tired defenders back into action and then the slaughter begins.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nMere moments later the camp of Karadas is burning and chaos spread through their ranks as Lorimur\u0027s cavalry charges them from behind. Slowly they\u0027re driven in the direction of the walls, where the arrows and boiling oil awaits them. Soon the desperate resistance crumbles and it turns in to a complete rout. \"Drive them towards the Valis!\" do you command as you ride out at the head of your knights. When it comes to hunting down fleeing enemies, your knights have no equals.\n\n\n\"Ha ha! Leave some of them for me! I bet a hundred gold coins I\u0027m going to hit that commander over there!\" yells Bomboulos, as he hops up and down on his horse while trying to aim his crossbow. Of course, anybody who agrees now is going to get rich quickly. His arrow flies through the air and hits... another soldier, by sheer dumb luck. \"That was intentional, totally intentional!\"\n\n\nWhile Fariera has a somewhat sadistic smile on her face, Tyrwill is busy complaining. \"Why are they running so fast? Now we have to ride even faster to catch up to those meanies, can\u0027t they slow down a little?\"\n\n\nFinally, Hallas tops it all of while riding his war-chariot, he slices through their ranks like a knife through butter. Okay, he\u0027s not steering, one of his henchmen is taking care of that. He\u0027s also not shooting anybody, again it\u0027s his two subordinates that are doing that. He\u0027s just maniacally laughing and... cheering them on? Anyway, he\u0027s really good at it.\n\n\nNot long later, the survivors surrender and victory shouts are ringing in your ears. \"Victory! We won! Hail Lorimur! Long live her highness, long live the knights of the Golden Sun!\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

He\u0027s nervously wringing his hands as if he\u0027s afraid more time will be lost.\n\n\n\"In the dream, I fought a foul beast together with my soldiers. Finally, I slew it and saved the day.\"\n\n\n\"Eh... Your Highness, that wasn\u0027t a dream at all! It was last week, that you ordered the royal guard to chase and kill that boar. Because the foul beast had the bold audacity to dodge your arrow and make it look as if you had missed it.\"\n\n\n\"Ah that boar, no, no. It was a real monster, what was it called again?... An ogre, that was it, the man-eating ogre. And the weirdest thing was, I was some kind of knight!\"\n\n\n\"An ogre? A creature out of fairy tales? But they often say, that our dreams are a twisted interpretation of reality or some kind of prediction of the future...\" Frederic slowly strokes his beard, while he\u0027s pondering. You were just casually making conversation, he wasn\u0027t supposed to search for any deeper meaning.\n\n\n\"Pff! Ridiculous! Just imagine, me as some kind of common knight? Running around saving plebeians? Highly amusing, ha ha!\" While you\u0027re laughing, you don\u0027t notice that Frederic maintains his serious expression.\n","page 145":"\"They earned us the displeasure of the heavens and...,\" begins Turokal. Here we go again.\n\n\n\"I asked \u0027exactly\u0027 that means, tell me what they precisely did and try to include some reliable proof, while you\u0027re at it.\"\n\n\n\"I read it in the stars...\" Then five of your soldiers aim their crossbows at the priest and all of a sudden he gets more down to earth. \"...Eh? What? Normally we don\u0027t ask ourselves these kinds of questions. And there might be no proof in this mortal realm, that would please you, my lady.\"\n\n\n\"And how do you know these people are responsible in any way?\"\n\n\n\"Ha ha, I just know! Look at them! They\u0027re sorcerers, witches, a stranger nobody knows and hideously deformed demon spawn!\" yells the priest while he wildly points at the prisoners.\n\n\n\"Ah, and what can they do? How dangerous can they be then?\"\n\n\n\"They used their foul curses to anger the heavens...\" Then the priest swallows the rest of his words when one of your soldiers is clumsy enough to accidentally fire his crossbow and the arrow firmly lands between his feet. \"I-I mean we don\u0027t exactly know what kind of spells they can use and it\u0027s difficult to explain how dangerous they are.\"\n\n\n\"How many soldiers are needed to catch one?\" It seems you\u0027ll have to resort to simpler measures to estimate the danger level.\n\n\n\"Soldiers? Ehm, three brave citizens you mean, my lady. Besides Borrie the woodcutter even got a broken nose, as he faced off against the demon spawn.\"\n\n\nAnd on the question, \u0027How was the injury inflicted?\u0027, it turns out, the spell in question was called \u0027fist\u0027. By now, it\u0027s quite clear that this kind of religious genocide is a bit arbitrary at best.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

(-10)\n","page 266":"All the important people of Valinor are gathered together inside the meeting hall, on the second floor of the castle. The knights of the Golden Sun, the three great nobles, the captain of your personal guard and the garrison commander. The goal of this emergency meeting is of course, how to deal with Karadas.\n\n\n\"I wanna go home!\" shouts Tyrwill. She\u0027s busy throwing her usual tantrum.\n\n\nWhile Fariera sits opposite her, unusually pale and with a wretched smile on her face. \"H-Hey... We\u0027re only knights for show right? We\u0027re not really going to f-fight are we?\" Her usual calm demeanor has completely collapsed now that she hears about the upcoming fight.\n\n\n\"There\u0027s over twenty thousand of them! Attacking us with numerical superiority, how dare they!\" screams Hallas. Indeed only we are supposed to absurdly outnumber our enemies, not the other way around.\n\n\nBomboulos is the only one, that manages to keep his cool and has sacrificed himself to take care of the unattended cookies on the table. \"Outnumbered? Can\u0027t you count? We outnumber them ten to one!\" Then Dovar has to spend some time and effort to explain the difference between an ordinary citizen and an armed veteran warrior. That the peasants can only serve as some fodder to keep the enemy busy and he shouldn\u0027t count them too heavily when comparing military strength. How else does he think a garrison of only 2000 strong could keep watch over the entire city? So actually it\u0027s your 300 guards, 2000 soldiers from the garrison, a mismatch of the city guard and the soldiers of the local nobles, in total roughly 800 strong. Backed by some kind of city militia, consisting out of able-bodied peasants who get to wield a weapon for the first time in their lives, estimated to be around 9000-11000 strong. But you have been warned not to expect too much from the militia, their morale is piss poor, they\u0027re poorly equipped, don\u0027t have any experience and are still busy figuring out which end of their spear to hold on. Okay that last remark, was probably a joke from Dovar. It\u0027s not going to be that bad... you hope.\n\n\n\"I estimate the enemies military power is somewhere between 6 to 10 times greater than us. Enough to risk a full-force assault siege and that\u0027s only assuming they won\u0027t receive any further reinforcements,\" summarizes Dovar. Then Bomboulos drops his cookie and just sits there stupefied, while his right eye begins to twitch. He didn\u0027t keep his composure out of confidence or bravery, but out of sheer stupidity. It seems all your knights are getting cold feet, now that things are getting serious. You have your doubts as well, when it comes to partying and throwing your weight around, you can always count on them. But never did you expect to do any knight business alongside them. Let alone fight a war, where the odds aren\u0027t in your favor.\n\n\n\"Are the great knights having difficulties, now that things are getting tough?\" jeers Iselda. She smiles mockingly at the gathered knights, who have lost all their bravado. Although you don\u0027t like to admit it, at the moment your knights look quite pathetic. Even more than usual. The other two nobles and Morvir are just quietly following the discussion. But you can see from their expressions, that the current performance of the knights of the Golden Sun is having an adverse effect on their fighting spirit.\n\n\nSomewhere deep down this angers you greatly. Although the prospects don\u0027t look very promising, this could be the opportunity to prove you\u0027re something else, something more. If you wish to do so, you\u0027ll have to persuade your fellow knights, or you can always choose to run away with your tail between your legs.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

The sun has already risen long ago and His Majesty is requesting for Your Highness her presence.\" A rather meddlesome voice suddenly disturbs your sweet dreams. Slowly you open your eyes and see the familiar canopy above you. You\u0027re wearing an elegant night-gown, made out of the finest fabric You\u0027re laying in your comfy bed, wrapped in the soft linen sheets. Besides the bed stands your servant Frederic, with a rather anxious expression on his middle-aged face.\n\n\nYou\u0027re Elsia Lanash, the crown princess of the kingdom of Lorimur. Yep, once again it\u0027s there, the most hateful moment of the day. The moment some annoying servant comes in whining, that you have to get up. In the seventeen years that you have lived, this has always been the hardest moment of the day. Okay, except on birthdays and other lavish parties in your honor, it\u0027s remarkably easier on those days. But unfortunately, this is no such day. Therefore you turn around and say, \"There\u0027s still time, give me five more minutes.\"\n\n\n\"Nooo! Eh...I mean your highness, I beg you to be reasonable. You still need to get dressed, bathe and eat breakfast!\" The last word he almost yells in tears. It\u0027s true you have never been that fast when it comes to breakfast, but now he\u0027s slightly exaggerating, in your totally unbiased opinion. Unfortunately, there\u0027s still one person more important than you in this kingdom, and that\u0027s your royal father. So it seems you\u0027ll have to put in some effort this time... After five minutes, of course. Never strain yourself!\n\n\nTwenty minutes later, you\u0027re up and relaxing in the bath. Then you hear Frederic\u0027s whining again from behind the screen. \"Please hurry, Your Highness!\" Such a stressed worrywart, it must be his age. After the bath, two servants help you get dressed. While they\u0027re busy, you\u0027re staring in the mirror and speak.\n","page 265":"You did it, you successfully managed to crush the rebellion. From out of the window, you can see your soldiers executing the great nobles, Iselda and Bartolomeus. They\u0027re obviously screaming things like, \"You horrible monster!\", \"One day, you\u0027ll pay for your sins!\" and \"See you in hell!\" They\u0027re quite the noisy lot. You sigh and close the window. Then you walk towards the rest of your knight order for a toast and a well-deserved victory banquet.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nFinally, the peasants of Valinor have accepted you as their eternal overlord... protector. Of course, there are still a few who have their doubts. But you have guest rooms to spare inside the dungeons and lots of interrogators that are just sitting there, twiddling their thumbs. So everything will be fine, now your golden age has arrived. An age where you can freely throw your weight around like never before. Judging from the smiles of your fellow knights, they\u0027re not going to miss out on this opportunity!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares. (-4120)\nPopularity: You\u0027re the bogeyman in children\u0027s tales. (-170)\n","page 8":"\"I won\u0027t disappoint you, Your Highness!\" Then Frederic makes another bow. Once you\u0027re dressed, you walk towards the banquet hall for breakfast. You\u0027re wearing your usual clothes. An elegant white dress, adorned with sapphires. Together with your favorite slippers. When you arrive, the same boring breakfast awaits. It consists of a dozen delicacies, imported from heavens may know where. Together with some cooled fruit juice and tea, it becomes edible.\n\n\nWhen you\u0027re done tasting the dishes, the leftovers are for the dogs or the servants. Not that much of a difference, anyway. You follow Frederic through the long hallway. You can see the garden through the mosaic glass of the windows, as you walk by. Every servant or guard you encounter on the way always seems to be so busy, hurrying along to somewhere. But as soon as they spot you, they have more than enough time to bow, grovel and spew flattery. So it makes you wonder, if they\u0027re actually so busy in the first place and why they\u0027re running around as if their legs are on fire?\n\n\nThen you arrive before the stairs leading to the eastern wing of the palace, where your father\u0027s study is located. Quite unusual, parties are organized in the hall or the garden, and official stuff is handled in the throne room. You have only visited your fathers study a few times before and each time your father wasn\u0027t exactly pleased with you. For example, the time you decided to host a BBQ in the royal library and almost burned it down to the ground. Or the time you floored the ambassador of Culin, which led to a diplomatic incident. Or the time you screamed, \u0027Party like there\u0027s no tomorrow, it\u0027s all on the treasury!\u0027 Anyway, it will be the usual, \u0027Don\u0027t abuse your authority, be a kind and righteous ruler... and so on,\u0027 After the sermon, you can head back and forget all about it, like always.\n\n\nWhile you were lost in your thoughts, you have already have arrived before your father\u0027s study. Frederic opens the wooden door before you and bows, while he announces you. \"Your Majesty, Her royal Highness has arrived.\"\n\n\nYou walk into the study, while Frederic closes the door behind you, in order to provide his masters with some privacy. It\u0027s a large study, more a library than an office by the way. Bookcase after bookcase rises up before you, while the sunlight comes in through the large rounded windows. In the center of the room, there\u0027s a large desk, covered in documents and letters. An old man stands near the window, with his back towards you. He\u0027s wearing a magnificent crown on his head and a wide robe over his shoulders. It\u0027s your esteemed father, King Karlor Lanash. Slowly he turns around and solemnly gazes at you. Although he isn\u0027t that old yet, his hair and beard already have become white and deep wrinkles are visible on his face. Some say, your father carries the fate of the entire kingdom on his back. But personally, you disagree. The old man simply gets up way too early and doesn\u0027t get enough sleep.\n\n\nHis posture radiates an almost tangible authority and power. It\u0027s like a formless pressure that always weighs down on you when you confront your father. You have inherited the looks from your mother, heavens have her soul, but you possess your father\u0027s eyes. And it\u0027s those same eyes that are now focused on you. As you feel the stern gaze of the king press down on you, you unconsciously shiver. For a moment you instinctively want to confess whatever you did wrong this time. But no matter how much you strain your memory, nothing comes to mind. Then your father sighs, \"Will I ever witness the day, you\u0027re on time for once?... Anyway, I called you here today to discuss an important matter. But first, let me ask you a question. What do you think, is the most important thing a kingdom needs?\"\n\n\n\"Uuu...\" Some things come to mind, like parties, money, soldiers, more parties, subjects, a large palace, and even more parties. But you\u0027re quite sure that your father would disagree if you mentioned any of these.\n\n\n\"A strong and decisive ruler! There are many kingdoms on this continent, some posses many resources, or have a strategic location, or have a large abundance of vital trade routes. Yet our kingdom, that lacks all of these, prospered and outstripped its competitors. How? Through sheer military force, we have conquered almost a third of the entire continent and have become one of its largest powers. How was such a thing possible? Because your great grandfather was one of the greatest and most fearless knights that have ever existed. He forged the famous knight order, unified the lands and carved a future for a small and weak nation with his sword.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, father I know, basic history lessons...\" The story of the common knight, that crowned himself king and became the most famous warlord of his age. You have heard it far too many times already.\n\n\n\"Indeed, and look at you now! What remains of that glory, of that determination and strength? What has become of his descendants?\" His gaze is filled with disappointment, while he slowly shakes his head.\n","page 147":"\"Aha! I understand you perfectly, my lady. You wish for a share of the donations from the believers of our faith! No problem at all, it shall be arranged,\" laughs Turokal. \n\n\n\"No, no, no. You see, money doesn\u0027t mean anything to me. The existence of your little cult also creates some problems for me. Therefore it\u0027s only natural that there should be some considerable benefits for me if I were to allow it to exist.\"\n\n\n\"Doesn\u0027t the entire world run on gold crowns? Eh...I don\u0027t really understand what kind of benefits my lady has in mind...\" It seems the priest isn\u0027t capable enough to think up anything good by himself, so you will have to spell it out to him.

(-20)\n","page 268":"At your sudden shout, all the knights almost fall off their chairs from the sudden start. It\u0027s easy to tell how tense they are. \"We\u0027re Lorimur\u0027s future elite! Who else but us, has more right to rule the kingdom? We\u0027re no common disposable pawns. Once our messengers arrive, my father will rush to our aid. We only have to hold out until then! Once we\u0027re back, I\u0027ll rightfully inherit the throne and you\u0027ll all be able to reap the benefits. Our future is golden and it\u0027s within arms reach. But those filthy dogs of Karadas are blocking our way. Will we allow them to deny our greatness which is ours by right? Will we just give up and let our entire quest go to waste? Answer me!\"\n\n\n\"B-But Lorimur is too far away, once they receive our call for aid they\u0027ll need time to mobilize and march over here!\" mumbles Hallas. He\u0027s got a point, an army moves very slow. The chance that you\u0027ll receive aid in time is slim.\n\n\n\"Damn it all!\" screams Bomboulos, with bloodshot eyes. It seems he has finally lost his mind due to fear. \"If I can\u0027t do whatever I want, then I might as well die! I\u0027m with you Boss!\" It turns out fear and madness can bring the best side of a person to the surface, but you do have some doubts about his motivation, though.\n\n\n\"Living as a stray on the streets will ruin my skin... Like hell we\u0027ll bow to those lowlifes!\" yells Fariera. Now they\u0027re beginning to quickly jump to outrageous assumptions, even if you all fled you could still live in luxury. But since they are getting fired up, there\u0027s no need to say it out loud.\n\n\n\"D-Does that mean I won\u0027t get any expensive birthday presents anymore?\" asks Tyrwill. Although it seems like she doesn\u0027t really get how serious the situation is, as long as it motivates them it will do. So you nod. \"Unacceptable! We\u0027ll teach those meanies a lesson.\"\n\n\nThe captain of your personal guard simply smiles. There\u0027s no need for fancy words or promises. He\u0027ll follow you to hell and will gladly behead anyone that can\u0027t bring up the same dedication to his master. So the morale of the knights of the Golden Sun has been restored. But it almost feels like you\u0027re forgetting a small tiny detail somewhere...\n\n\n\"Elite? You?! The throne of Lorimur?\" asks Iselda bewildered. And judging from the gaping expressions of the other three stooges, they\u0027re equally surprised. Oops...It seems the cat is out of the bag now. Well, since everything is now quickly approaching its finale, it should be okay.\n\n\n\"Ahem, I\u0027m the crown princess of Lorimur, did we \u0027forgot\u0027 to tell you?\"\n\n\n\"Y-You the crown princess?! And that bunch of clowns over there is the future ruling class of Lorimur??\" screams Iselda. You can understand their shock and surprise, but all four of them are looking at you as if both Lorimur and Valinor are doomed. That\u0027s quite rude actually, especially Morvir, who\u0027s just a run-of-the-mill slacker. Dovar makes a light cough while placing his hand on the hilt of his sword, reminding Morvir about his manners. Then Morvir quickly jumps up and kneels before you. With some adequate flattering you decide to forgive him.\n\n\nThen the tasks are divided, Dovar will arrange all his soldiers and work with Morvir as the core force of the defense. Basically, he\u0027ll tell Morvir what to do and what not to. In the meantime, the great nobles will rally their troops and gather every able-bodied peasant and send them over to Dovar, for a quick crash-course \u0027arrow-fodder\u0027 for dummies. While you and your knights will... supervise and encourage everybody.

I will serve you to the utmost of my ability, for many years to come!\"\n\n\nYou just blurted it out and the old man gets carried away.

You\u0027re wearing your usual clothes. An elegant white dress, adorned with sapphires. Together with your favorite slippers. When you arrive, the same boring breakfast awaits. It consists of a dozen delicacies, imported from heavens may know where. Together with some cooled fruit juice and tea, it becomes edible.\n\n\nWhen you\u0027re done tasting the dishes, the leftovers are for the dogs or the servants. Not that much of a difference, anyway. You follow Frederic through the long hallway. You can see the garden through the mosaic glass of the windows, as you walk by. Every servant or guard you encounter on the way always seems to be so busy, hurrying along to somewhere. But as soon as they spot you, they have more than enough time to bow, grovel and spew flattery. So it makes you wonder, if they\u0027re actually so busy in the first place and why they\u0027re running around as if their legs are on fire?\n\n\nThen you arrive before the stairs leading to the eastern wing of the palace, where your father\u0027s study is located. Quite unusual, parties are organized in the hall or the garden, and official stuff is handled in the throne room. You have only visited your fathers study a few times before and each time your father wasn\u0027t exactly pleased with you. For example, the time you decided to host a BBQ in the royal library and almost burned it down to the ground. Or the time you floored the ambassador of Culin, which led to a diplomatic incident. Or the time you screamed, \u0027Party like there\u0027s no tomorrow, it\u0027s all on the treasury!\u0027 Anyway, it will be the usual, \u0027Don\u0027t abuse your authority, be a kind and righteous ruler... and so on,\u0027 After the sermon, you can head back and forget all about it, like always.\n\n\nWhile you were lost in your thoughts, you have already have arrived before your father\u0027s study. Frederic opens the wooden door before you and bows, while he announces you. \"Your Majesty, Her royal Highness has arrived.\"\n\n\nYou walk into the study, while Frederic closes the door behind you, in order to provide his masters with some privacy. It\u0027s a large study, more a library than an office by the way. Bookcase after bookcase rises up before you, while the sunlight comes in through the large rounded windows. In the center of the room, there\u0027s a large desk, covered in documents and letters. An old man stands near the window, with his back towards you. He\u0027s wearing a magnificent crown on his head and a wide robe over his shoulders. It\u0027s your esteemed father, King Karlor Lanash. Slowly he turns around and solemnly gazes at you. Although he isn\u0027t that old yet, his hair and beard already have become white and deep wrinkles are visible on his face. Some say, your father carries the fate of the entire kingdom on his back. But personally, you disagree. The old man simply gets up way too early and doesn\u0027t get enough sleep.\n\n\nHis posture radiates an almost tangible authority and power. It\u0027s like a formless pressure that always weighs down on you when you confront your father. You have inherited the looks from your mother, heavens have her soul, but you possess your father\u0027s eyes. And it\u0027s those same eyes that are now focused on you. As you feel the stern gaze of the king press down on you, you unconsciously shiver. For a moment you instinctively want to confess whatever you did wrong this time. But no matter how much you strain your memory, nothing comes to mind. Then your father sighs, \"Will I ever witness the day, you\u0027re on time for once?... Anyway, I called you here today to discuss an important matter. But first, let me ask you a question. What do you think, is the most important thing a kingdom needs?\"\n\n\n\"Uuu...\" Some things come to mind, like parties, money, soldiers, more parties, subjects, a large palace, and even more parties. But you\u0027re quite sure that your father would disagree if you mentioned any of these.\n\n\n\"A strong and decisive ruler! There are many kingdoms on this continent, some posses many resources, or have a strategic location, or have a large abundance of vital trade routes. Yet our kingdom, that lacks all of these, prospered and outstripped its competitors. How? Through sheer military force, we have conquered almost a third of the entire continent and have become one of its largest powers. How was such a thing possible? Because your great grandfather was one of the greatest and most fearless knights that have ever existed. He forged the famous knight order, unified the lands and carved a future for a small and weak nation with his sword.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, father I know, basic history lessons...\" The story of the common knight, that crowned himself king and became the most famous warlord of his age.

The fortress in Valinor has been intentionally placed upstream to maintain control over the Valis. In fact, he claimed we should all be praying the enemy is stupid enough to attack the dock without conquering the fortress first.

Everybody stocks up the needed supplies to make it through the coldest and harshest season of the year. The nobles clink their glasses together to celebrate a good year of trade and taxes, while the peasants are despairing how they\u0027re going to survive this time. Of course, it\u0027s the fear for an uncertain future, that drives people to do odd things. Things that are somewhat... incomprehensible for you, at least from the viewpoint of your warm and comfortable sofa. Well, they\u0027re peasants, you\u0027re never going to understand them. And like spring brings hope, autumn brings along a bunch of lunatics seeking to exploit the fear of the common man. On a certain morning, on an ordinary day, you end up running into such a lunatic.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nYou\u0027re riding on your horse through the streets of Valinor, with the rest of your entourage behind you. The weather is still nice, for this time of the year. You and your knight order went out to hunt a rumored legendary deer. But you failed to catch it since Haleth asked you to spare it. Well at least you had a nice day out. When you arrive at the city square, you spot a large crowd of people. It seems there\u0027s some kind of event going on.\n\n\nIn the middle of the crowd, there are multiple piles of wood, about two meters in height. At the peak of each pile rises a long wooden beam up. At every wooden beam, there\u0027s somebody tied up to. They are dressed in rags and look a bit odd. Some of them are screaming and begging for mercy, while others are apathetically gazing in front of them. On a platform before the pyres a fat and bald man, wearing wide red robes, looms over the crowd. The man has a fanatic look in his eyes as he gazes up and slowly spreads his arms. \"Oh let the heavens have mercy on us. Why did the fields not yield a harvest that\u0027s large enough? Why do the innocent get sick, when the cold wind blows? Why aren\u0027t we receiving the favor of the heavens?\" After an overly dramatic long pause and the man suddenly points his hand up in the air. \"I, great priest Turokal of the church of the Eternal Light, have spent countless nights searching the heavenly firmament for answers! As I tirelessly gazed at the stars, slowly a shocking answer came to me. There are some amongst us, that have displeased the heavens and earned us their wrath!\"\n\n\nShocked the crowd holds its breath, eagerly waiting for the priest to continue. Agitated Turokal walks around the stage then he suddenly turns towards the wooden piles. \"The evil and the wicked! They have unleashed hunger and sickness over the innocent! But do not despair, there\u0027s still hope for salvation. A way to make the heavens smile on us once again! We must cleanse our humble community of such individuals! And the order of the Eternal Light is the only way to fight such evil!\" Slowly the crowd gets more and more riled up and they begin to loudly agree with the priest. Then Turokal dramatically claps his hand together. \"We shall cleanse them in the holy fires, as we shall cleanse our hearts! Burn these sorcerers, light the pyres. Let it bring us warmth and the forgiveness of the heavens!\" Then an executioner steps forward to ignite the wood with his torch.\n\n\nThere\u0027s quite the farce going on, they\u0027ll probably encounter these kinds of problems every year. So that it still took \u0027countless nights of tirelessly searching\u0027 to arrive at the same answer as all the years before, could make you wonder about the competence of this priest. But it seems he\u0027s quite skilled at riling the peasants up in the yearly burn-the-witch event. Then again, it\u0027s your first time witnessing something like this. Lorimur is a strict military state and your grandfather exterminated every single church and religious cults. Some say he wanted to free the people from religious strife, while others say he simply wanted to hog all the power and influence to himself. Knowing grandpa, it was probably the latter of the two. If a king or queen wishes for an absolute monarchy, a church is nothing but an eyesore. Of course any peaceful orders that wanted to teach the people how to live in harmony with each other, got eradicated too. Your grandpa was always pretty dedicated when it came to eliminating any possible future hindrances.\n\n\nSuddenly Bomboulos rushes forward on his horse. \"Stop! Stop this at once! What do you think you\u0027re doing?!\" He\u0027s loudly screaming, while his horse charges through the crowd. You and the rest of the knights and soldiers follow behind him, albeit a bit surprised about his behavior.\n\n\nThe executioner hesitates and gazes up at the priest, who turns around to look at the person who dared to disturb them. Turokal looks annoyed at first, but when he sees that Bomboulos is a knight and an awfully rich one at that, he gets a lot more amicable. And when he sees the large group of knights and soldiers following behind him, he completely turns into a friendly and patient middle-aged man, who would gladly listen to your worries. \"Oh, my lord, I didn\u0027t see you immediately. Welcome, in our midst, your lordship! Is there anything I can help you with?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m ordering you to stop! You were going to...\" screams Bomboulos almost out of breath.\n\n\n\"Please make no mistake, these are foul demon spawn, who...\" begins the priest.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Bomboulos, while he waves annoyed at the priest. \"And you can burn them for all I care. Burning witches isn\u0027t much of a problem by itself, but burning them without my boss permission, well that\u0027s a big problem!\"\n\n\n\"Ah... your boss? But the great nobles can\u0027t do anything to me... I mean, I have the approval of the great nobles. So who\u0027s your...\" stammers the priest.\n\n\n\"Her ladyship Elsia, the leader of the knight order of the Golden Sun! You ignorant monkey! She\u0027s the one that owns the place here!\" snarls Fariera. It seems your fellow knights are more concerned about his actions challenging your authority than the witches involved.

It seems there\u0027s some kind of event going on.\n\n\nIn the middle of the crowd, there are multiple piles of wood, about two meters in height. At the peak of each pile rises a long wooden beam up. At every wooden beam, there\u0027s somebody tied up to. They are dressed in rags and look a bit odd. Some of them are screaming and begging for mercy, while others are apathetically gazing in front of them. On a platform before the pyres a fat and bald man, wearing wide red robes, looms over the crowd. The man has a fanatic look in his eyes as he gazes up and slowly spreads his arms. \"Oh let the heavens have mercy on us. Why did the fields not yield a harvest that\u0027s large enough? Why do the innocent get sick, when the cold wind blows? Why aren\u0027t we receiving the favor of the heavens?\" After an overly dramatic long pause and the man suddenly points his hand up in the air. \"I, great priest Turokal of the church of the Eternal Light, have spent countless nights searching the heavenly firmament for answers! As I tirelessly gazed at the stars, slowly a shocking answer came to me. There are some amongst us, that have displeased the heavens and earned us their wrath!\"\n\n\nShocked the crowd holds its breath, eagerly waiting for the priest to continue. Agitated Turokal walks around the stage then he suddenly turns towards the wooden piles. \"The evil and the wicked! They have unleashed hunger and sickness over the innocent! But do not despair, there\u0027s still hope for salvation. A way to make the heavens smile on us once again! We must cleanse our humble community of such individuals! And the order of the Eternal Light is the only way to fight such evil!\" Slowly the crowd gets more and more riled up and they begin to loudly agree with the priest. Then Turokal dramatically claps his hand together. \"We shall cleanse them in the holy fires, as we shall cleanse our hearts! Burn these sorcerers, light the pyres. Let it bring us warmth and the forgiveness of the heavens!\" Then an executioner steps forward to ignite the wood with his torch.\n\n\nThere\u0027s quite the farce going on, they\u0027ll probably encounter these kinds of problems every year. So that it still took \u0027countless nights of tirelessly searching\u0027 to arrive at the same answer as all the years before, could make you wonder about the competence of this priest. But it seems he\u0027s quite skilled at riling the peasants up in the yearly burn-the-witch event. Then again, it\u0027s your first time witnessing something like this. Lorimur is a strict military state and your grandfather exterminated every single church and religious cults. Some say he wanted to free the people from religious strife, while others say he simply wanted to hog all the power and influence to himself. Knowing grandpa, it was probably the latter of the two. If a king or queen wishes for an absolute monarchy, a church is nothing but an eyesore. Of course any peaceful orders that wanted to teach the people how to live in harmony with each other, got eradicated too. Your grandpa was always pretty dedicated when it came to eliminating any possible future hindrances.\n\n\nSuddenly Bomboulos rushes forward on his horse. \"Stop! Stop this at once! What do you think you\u0027re doing?!\" He\u0027s loudly screaming, while his horse charges through the crowd. You and the rest of the knights and soldiers follow behind him, albeit a bit surprised about his behavior.\n\n\nThe executioner hesitates and gazes up at the priest, who turns around to look at the person who dared to disturb them. Turokal looks annoyed at first, but when he sees that Bomboulos is a knight and an awfully rich one at that, he gets a lot more amicable. And when he sees the large group of knights and soldiers following behind him, he completely turns into a friendly and patient middle-aged man, who would gladly listen to your worries. \"Oh, my lord, I didn\u0027t see you immediately. Welcome, in our midst, your lordship! Is there anything I can help you with?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m ordering you to stop! You were going to...\" screams Bomboulos almost out of breath.\n\n\n\"Please make no mistake, these are foul demon spawn, who...\" begins the priest.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Bomboulos, while he waves annoyed at the priest. \"And you can burn them for all I care. Burning witches isn\u0027t much of a problem by itself, but burning them without my boss permission, well that\u0027s a big problem!\"\n\n\n\"Ah... your boss? But the great nobles can\u0027t do anything to me... I mean, I have the approval of the great nobles. So who\u0027s your...\" stammers the priest.\n\n\n\"Her ladyship Elsia, the leader of the knight order of the Golden Sun! You ignorant monkey! She\u0027s the one that owns the place here!\" snarls Fariera. It seems your fellow knights are more concerned about his actions challenging your authority than the witches involved. Although he\u0027s by no means a threat to somebody like you, if such cults are not handled properly they tend to become quite the pain.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

Every single time the same thing happens. The door gets broken down, the furniture trashed, closets and walls destroyed during the search for any hidden rooms. At the time of the search, the families are taken into custody and are forced to wait outside their houses. In case they\u0027re lucky and nothing is found, they can return to their wrecked homes. Otherwise, their fates are sealed. Even the rich and those who have some status aren\u0027t excluded from the search. The merchant Dolric, who trades expensive and rare glass wares, was wailing and crying his eyes out after his shop was searched.\n\n\nAlthough the search is performed with the same finesse as someone diagnosing a patient with a hammer, it did yield some results in the end.

Then suddenly a man dressed in red robes walks through their midst, it\u0027s nobody else than Turokal. \"I\u0027m only an ignorant mortal so please heavens, I beg you for forgiveness for my doubts, my questions, and hesitation. Feel free to take your wrath on me, but spare these lost sheep, they need help more than ever during this dark hour!\" Slowly his voice gains in volume and he almost shouts his last sentence, attracting the attention of all the nearby people.\n\n\nThe man falls on his knees and looks up to the sky. \"I\u0027m but a humble priest, an ever pious believer in the Eternal Light. Yet for the sake of these innocent and lost children, I shall commit a grave sin. I ask you, why? Why must the days be so dark? What did these people do wrong, to deserve to earn your wrath? Why aren\u0027t the knights of the Golden Sun, receiving their just punishment? Why do the innocent continue to suffer?\" The crowd hangs on his lips, eager for the answer. An old lady nearby desperately clings her wrinkled hands together in silent prayer.\n\n\nTurokal\u0027s eyes glaze over and he enters some sort of trance. \"I see... they\u0027re a trail send by the heavens. We must endure this test if we ever wish to bask into the Eternal Light. I don\u0027t understand... But I\u0027m willing to shoulder their sins and blame. Please, people of Valinor, direct your anger towards me, I shall bear it all. So that the heavens might forgive us.\" Then he humbly slums down. But nobody dares to touch him, everybody is stunned by what he said.\n\n\n\"This is lunacy! So we should just tolerate these knights?\" asks an old scholar. He stiffly approaches the priest.\n\n\nBut a burly smith stops him. \"No! This man is doing the bidding of the heavens! Don\u0027t you dare touch him, you crazy bookworm!\"\n\n\n\"Yeah!\" I remember him, he\u0027s the one spewing blasphemy about natural phenomenons!\" shouts a drunken laborer.\n\n\n\"A heathen?\" asks Turokal, while he gets up. Well, everybody knows what happens with heathens. \"Pile up the wood, we\u0027ll purge him with fire!\"\n\n\n-------\n\n\nSo the order of the Eternal Light, slowly cleanses Valinor of everybody that can\u0027t understand the trail the heavens have presented them. Every day the order grows stronger and more influential. The dissatisfaction of the people weakens by some good old fashioned religious-brainwashing and order returns to Valinor once more. But unintended perhaps, the church of the Eternal Light has taken deep root inside the city and the following years it spreads into the surroundings. After the king of Lorimur passes away, with the help of the order of the Eternal Light, princess Elsia ascends the throne. But the order has grown so powerful now, that there\u0027s no way to root them out anymore, and it\u0027s certainly impossible to the one who became queen with their help. Or should we say, puppet dancing to the tune of the church?\n\n\nEither way, she can still spend a comfortable life in indulgence. After all, \u0027officially\u0027 Her Majesty is one of the highest and mightiest of the kingdom.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

Of course, the crown princess will gladly appoint you to any position you see fit, but these countryside knights don\u0027t need to know that.\n\n\n\"What? But even the regent of Valinor, has no right to be this overbearing!\" yells the leader of the knights. Then here and there, some knights draw their weapons, while they furiously gaze at the members of your order.\n\n\n\"They are plotting against Lorimur, seize them!\" On your command, all the soldiers present pounce on the bunch of unfortunate knights. It seems that although they noticed the soldiers nearby, they never expected they would immediately attack when ordered by you. Did they perhaps think, you were over-exaggerating your authority? Anyway, the knights are soon overwhelmed and captured. All their weapons and armors are removed and in chains, they are dragged away.\n\n\nSince it turns out, they were the only opponents still capable of putting up any resistance, cheating isn\u0027t necessary anymore.

With the suffocating grip of their iron fist, they have always squashed any who ever stood in their way and they\u0027ll always continue to do so. Now that their leader has steeled her heart and given the orders, the small city-state of Valinor will pay in blood.\n\n\n--------\n\n\nAn angry crowd has formed itself on the city square, pitchforks, cudgels, scythes, and other farming tools, are raised into the air. A burly man jumps on a carriage and yells towards the crowd. \"People of Valinor! These despicable bandits, who call themselves \u0027knights\u0027 have defiled our beloved Valinor! Since when was the stench of the corpses, of the innocents they executed, normal? Do you believe the hundreds of poor souls hanging from the gallows, are criminals? For what? Looking at those murderers in the wrong way? Saying something that displeased them? Throwing a stone and making a dent in their precious armor? Since when have we stopped to raise any questions when somebody gets tortured or executed? These monsters have twisted our city beyond all recognition!\"\n\n\nHis voice thunders over the masses, and the masses answer him back with a deafening roar. With tears in his eyes, the man continues. \"Will we just stand by and watch? See how our brothers, sisters, parents and loved ones are brutally snatched away from us?\"\n\n\n\"No! No! No!\" chants the crowd. The tumult of their makeshift weapons echoes through the whole square.\n\n\n\"As long as justice and freedom still hold any meaning to you, then fight! Together we can do it! As long as we stand together, we can slay the beast!\"\n\n\n\"Yes, free Valinor from this never-ending nightmare!\" yells a middle-aged woman. \"Storm the castle!\" yells another man. \"Those monster won\u0027t take a single child of mine anymore,\" screams a woman. Madness is visible in her eyes.\n\n\nThen a young woman with an icy cold look in her eyes arrives at the square, seated on a magnificent horse. With her hair as radiant as the sun, she looks like an angel, who has descended in the mortal realm. But her beauty fails to conceal the horror beneath it. \"A group of stray peasants, who have forgotten their places, how pitiful. No need for any mercy, clean them all up.\" Slowly she raises her arm and gives the signal to attack, to the hundreds of cavalry soldiers behind her. Once they receive the command, they immediately ride past the woman and charge at the crowd. Their lances pierce through the unlucky ones at the front. The ones that fall down get crushed by the hooves of the horses and with their swords they begin to hack into the crowd.\n\n\nPeople scream as the soldiers slaughter their way towards the man on the carriage. A few quick-witted peasants, try to flee from the square. But their path gets blocked by the soldiers of the garrison. They form multiple shield walls, to block all nearby streets and so close off any possible escape routes. While dozens of guards armed with crossbows, appear on the rooftops of the nearby houses. Without a shred of hesitation, they start shooting at the fleeing people. Nobody will escape, everything will be wiped clean in a sea of blood. Once the agonized screams finally quieten down, the massacre is over.\n\n\nBut it\u0027s too soon, for the young ruler to celebrate. Everywhere in the city, the flames of the rebellion have been lit. Even the most cowardly peasant grabs a kitchen knife or tool. If they don\u0027t fight today, will they ever see hope again? The bloodbath at the city square becomes the symbol of Lorimur\u0027s oppression and the Innocent\u0027s who died in it become martyrs. In the face of the combined wrath of the people, there\u0027s no other choice but to flee. Perhaps due to her excessive pride, the young knight has forgotten, that this is Valinor and not Lorimur. There are simply not enough soldiers present to make the people accept such tyranny. So while the garrison tries to... hold out as long as possible, the knights of the Golden Sun flee the city.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

The city is preparing itself for the coming winter. Everybody stocks up the needed supplies to make it through the coldest and harshest season of the year. The nobles clink their glasses together to celebrate a good year of trade and taxes, while the peasants are despairing how they\u0027re going to survive this time. Of course, it\u0027s the fear for an uncertain future, that drives people to do odd things. Things that are somewhat... incomprehensible for you, at least from the viewpoint of your warm and comfortable sofa. Well, they\u0027re peasants, you\u0027re never going to understand them. And like spring brings hope, autumn brings along a bunch of lunatics seeking to exploit the fear of the common man. On a certain morning, on an ordinary day, you end up running into such a lunatic.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nYou\u0027re riding on your horse through the streets of Valinor, with the rest of your entourage behind you. The weather is still nice, for this time of the year. You and your knight order went out to hunt a rumored legendary deer. But you failed to catch it since Haleth asked you to spare it. Well at least you had a nice day out. When you arrive at the city square, you spot a large crowd of people. It seems there\u0027s some kind of event going on.\n\n\nIn the middle of the crowd, there are multiple piles of wood, about two meters in height. At the peak of each pile rises a long wooden beam up. At every wooden beam, there\u0027s somebody tied up to. They are dressed in rags and look a bit odd. Some of them are screaming and begging for mercy, while others are apathetically gazing in front of them. On a platform before the pyres a fat and bald man, wearing wide red robes, looms over the crowd. The man has a fanatic look in his eyes as he gazes up and slowly spreads his arms. \"Oh let the heavens have mercy on us. Why did the fields not yield a harvest that\u0027s large enough? Why do the innocent get sick, when the cold wind blows? Why aren\u0027t we receiving the favor of the heavens?\" After an overly dramatic long pause and the man suddenly points his hand up in the air. \"I, great priest Turokal of the church of the Eternal Light, have spent countless nights searching the heavenly firmament for answers! As I tirelessly gazed at the stars, slowly a shocking answer came to me. There are some amongst us, that have displeased the heavens and earned us their wrath!\"\n\n\nShocked the crowd holds its breath, eagerly waiting for the priest to continue. Agitated Turokal walks around the stage then he suddenly turns towards the wooden piles. \"The evil and the wicked! They have unleashed hunger and sickness over the innocent! But do not despair, there\u0027s still hope for salvation. A way to make the heavens smile on us once again! We must cleanse our humble community of such individuals! And the order of the Eternal Light is the only way to fight such evil!\" Slowly the crowd gets more and more riled up and they begin to loudly agree with the priest. Then Turokal dramatically claps his hand together. \"We shall cleanse them in the holy fires, as we shall cleanse our hearts! Burn these sorcerers, light the pyres. Let it bring us warmth and the forgiveness of the heavens!\" Then an executioner steps forward to ignite the wood with his torch.\n\n\nThere\u0027s quite the farce going on, they\u0027ll probably encounter these kinds of problems every year. So that it still took \u0027countless nights of tirelessly searching\u0027 to arrive at the same answer as all the years before, could make you wonder about the competence of this priest. But it seems he\u0027s quite skilled at riling the peasants up in the yearly burn-the-witch event. Then again, it\u0027s your first time witnessing something like this. Lorimur is a strict military state and your grandfather exterminated every single church and religious cults. Some say he wanted to free the people from religious strife, while others say he simply wanted to hog all the power and influence to himself. Knowing grandpa, it was probably the latter of the two. If a king or queen wishes for an absolute monarchy, a church is nothing but an eyesore. Of course any peaceful orders that wanted to teach the people how to live in harmony with each other, got eradicated too.

What do you think you\u0027re doing?!\" He\u0027s loudly screaming, while his horse charges through the crowd. You and the rest of the knights and soldiers follow behind him, albeit a bit surprised about his behavior.\n\n\nThe executioner hesitates and gazes up at the priest, who turns around to look at the person who dared to disturb them. Turokal looks annoyed at first, but when he sees that Bomboulos is a knight and an awfully rich one at that, he gets a lot more amicable. And when he sees the large group of knights and soldiers following behind him, he completely turns into a friendly and patient middle-aged man, who would gladly listen to your worries. \"Oh, my lord, I didn\u0027t see you immediately. Welcome, in our midst, your lordship! Is there anything I can help you with?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m ordering you to stop! You were going to...\" screams Bomboulos almost out of breath.\n\n\n\"Please make no mistake, these are foul demon spawn, who...\" begins the priest.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Bomboulos, while he waves annoyed at the priest. \"And you can burn them for all I care. Burning witches isn\u0027t much of a problem by itself, but burning them without my boss permission, well that\u0027s a big problem!\"\n\n\n\"Ah... your boss?

But rest assured, I and my order, will thoroughly investigate these despicable crimes and catch whoever is responsible!\"\n\n\n-------\n\n\nA few days later the investigation is over and Hallas has managed to catch the mastermind, one of his own henchmen. The mastermind quickly admits everything and together with a few other scapegoats, he\u0027s punished for his crimes. And the order of the Golden Sun has been completely \u0027purged\u0027 of all the evil subordinates that misused their trust. Pretending to know nothing and then quickly getting a scapegoat, that\u0027s responsible for every single thing that went wrong, is an age-old tactic. But it turns out to be effective. Of course, some of the nobles and knights don\u0027t believe such obvious lies, but the peasants do.

So in order to save their comrades, they\u0027ll probably do something very rash and stupid. The next day the herald is standing again in the middle of the city square and announces the mass execution that will follow three days later. Well if they asked you, you would have organized it today. But you have to give people some time, to more or less plan their suicidal action. Otherwise, the more intelligent ones amongst them might try to dissuade them from doing it. Although you\u0027re taking a bit of a risk by provoking the rebels like this, you think it will be fine.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nThree days later, a massive stage is erected on the city square and completely surrounded by soldiers.

It seems he doesn\u0027t think anybody would risk his or her life for a family member, a loved one or a friend. Hey! Does that mean he also wouldn\u0027t come to save his \u0027boss\u0027, if it would ever come down to it? Perhaps it best not to think too much about it.\n\n\nThen the herald begins with announcing their crimes. In reality, there\u0027s only one and that\u0027s opposing you and your order. But since that would sound kind of bad, you made some up to go along with it. In fact, they became quite despicable criminals, murder, theft, arson, excessive violence, betrayal, torture, and rape. Then the hanging can finally start and the first person who\u0027s frantically begging for his life is dragged forwards. And just as they are going to hang him, his saviors arrive. A single arrow perfectly cuts the noose loose at the moment they kick the stool away. Then multiple hooded figures surge out of the crowd and charge the guards together with a few riled up peasants.\n\n\nHonestly said, if you didn\u0027t know any better you would think this is some kind of play, with such blood-freezing timing. Their leader, a masked woman, breaks through the soldiers and courageously begins to fight against the executioners on the stage. While her subordinates begin to free the prisoners. But unfortunately for them, you\u0027re the one who directs this play. You snap with your fingers and on the rooftops of the nearby buildings, countless guards armed with crossbows show themselves. Many \u0027riled up peasants\u0027 suddenly switch sides and from behind the stage, a whole lot of reinforcements are coming. Too bad!\n\n\nThe woman loses her mask during the fight and you recognize her, it\u0027s Iselda. Well, you actually just pretended not to recognize her, to keep the play more entertaining. Because her disguise was only third rate and the number of possible candidates was... Let\u0027s say fairly limited. Anyway, you know now, who the rebels leaders are. That annoying old fart called Bartolomeus must be in cahoots with her. It seems the show will soon find its closure. Time to let the curtain fall.\n\n\nOh, and Bomboulos cheer up!

Fewer and fewer merchant ships travel the Valis now and the activity at the docks calms down.

His face is full of wrinkles due to exposure to the elements. He has been a supervisor at the port of Valinor for over twenty years.

He gazes at the never changing Valis, while he wraps his arms around himself to keep him warm. Then he spots a lone merchant ship drifting on the water. Yes, it\u0027s drifting along and not sailing. There\u0027s no crew to see on the deck and there are multiple holes in the sail. It seems they must have encountered some kind of accident while traveling during the winter and ended up paying dearly for their greed. Although the crew is pitiable, the ship and its cargo are for the lucky finder. Even though he will have to relinquish a large part to the nobility, what remains will be for him and his men.\n\n\n\"One man\u0027s loss is another man\u0027s gain,\" mutters Ted. Then he turns around and whistles at a few young men, who are hanging around at the wharf. Once they hear their boss call them, they immediately stop talking and focus their attention on him. Ted slowly nods in the direction of the ship and his subordinates quickly catch on, it\u0027s going to be a good day.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nNot long later, they sail towards the merchant ship, with a smaller albeit faster and more agile ship. Once they reach it, they climb aboard. Ted has witnessed more than one ship falling prey to pirates and bandits, so he instantly notices that there\u0027s something off. The crew is lying motionless on the deck of the ship, but there are no wounds. In fact, there\u0027s not even a single sign of a possible struggle!

As he nudges closer, one of the rats that\u0027s gnawing at the corpse jumps out and bites him on his hand. He beats the nasty pest away and inspects the bloody bite on his hand, luckily it doesn\u0027t seem to be serious. Then he notices something that makes his blood freeze. The corpse is covered in black spots, its no dirt... it\u0027s as if the skin began to decay all of a sudden.

So I guess, I don\u0027t have much right to complain,\" sighs Ted, while he walks over the dock. He\u0027s a somewhat older man, wearing thick gray clothes, to protect himself against the cold. His face is full of wrinkles due to exposure to the elements. He has been a supervisor at the port of Valinor for over twenty years. His task is to supervise the loading and unloading of the docked ships and handle all the necessary paperwork. There\u0027s not that much paperwork, but as the only person who can read of his group, he has to handle it all. He gazes at the never changing Valis, while he wraps his arms around himself to keep him warm. Then he spots a lone merchant ship drifting on the water. Yes, it\u0027s drifting along and not sailing. There\u0027s no crew to see on the deck and there are multiple holes in the sail. It seems they must have encountered some kind of accident while traveling during the winter and ended up paying dearly for their greed. Although the crew is pitiable, the ship and its cargo are for the lucky finder. Even though he will have to relinquish a large part to the nobility, what remains will be for him and his men.\n\n\n\"One man\u0027s loss is another man\u0027s gain,\" mutters Ted. Then he turns around and whistles at a few young men, who are hanging around at the wharf. Once they hear their boss call them, they immediately stop talking and focus their attention on him. Ted slowly nods in the direction of the ship and his subordinates quickly catch on, it\u0027s going to be a good day.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nNot long later, they sail towards the merchant ship, with a smaller albeit faster and more agile ship. Once they reach it, they climb aboard. Ted has witnessed more than one ship falling prey to pirates and bandits, so he instantly notices that there\u0027s something off. The crew is lying motionless on the deck of the ship, but there are no wounds. In fact, there\u0027s not even a single sign of a possible struggle! And from the looks of it, their cargo is intact too. While rubbing his hands, one of his subordinates eagerly walks forward, but he\u0027s stopped by Ted. \"Keep your distance, there\u0027s something... not right.\"\n\n\nThe men decide to trust their experienced boss and now that it has been pointed out, they notice the ominous atmosphere surrounding the ship. It\u0027s almost as if, death itself has cast a shroud over this vessel. Slowly Ted shuffles closer to one of the sailors, the man is partly covered by a piece of sail. As he nudges closer, one of the rats that\u0027s gnawing at the corpse jumps out and bites him on his hand. He beats the nasty pest away and inspects the bloody bite on his hand, luckily it doesn\u0027t seem to be serious. Then he notices something that makes his blood freeze. The corpse is covered in black spots, its no dirt... it\u0027s as if the skin began to decay all of a sudden. The face of the man is wretched in pain and despair, as he lies on the floor, strangely contracted. It\u0027s the herald of death... a plague!\n\n\nTed stumbles backward and yells to his men, \"Back to our ship! Quickly!  Burn this cursed vessel, along with its cargo and crew!\" Then he suddenly remembers his hand and the bite on it. He quickly hides his hand in his clothes, none of his subordinates has noticed it. \"It should be okay, it\u0027s barely a scratch...\"\n\n\nIn a daze he watches the merchant ship being engulfed by the flames while he stands on the deck of his own ship, as they try to get as far away as possible. Slowly Ted closes his hands and utters a silent prayer, that everything will be alright.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

Some evil people may even think you\u0027re some random nobody with wild delusions of grandeur!\" yells the priest, who still has a few doubts about your great idea.\n\n\nLuckily one of your soldiers presses his spear against his chest, to help him overcome his hesitation. \"Iii!

Perhaps you\u0027re a bit lacking in the eyes of the commoners or the priest is simply not competent enough, probably it\u0027s the latter. Either way, nobody believes those lies. Forcefully trying to claim you\u0027re some kind of saint and trying to usurp a religious order, isn\u0027t welcomed by the believers and non-believers alike. Quickly religious unrest spreads in Valinor, plunging the city into chaos and anarchy.\n\n\nOf course, the priest and the garrison go to great lengths in order to suppress the unrest, on your orders. Every day a dozen heathens that refuse to acknowledge your faith are burned on the main square. But when the wood begins to run out and all kinds of fanatics begin to flock towards Valinor, the situation slowly goes out of control. Other religious organizations pop up, each with their own deity who will rule the city-state from now on and the conflict intensifies. Finally one of the fanatics murders Turokal in his sleep and this is the spark that sets everything ablaze.\n\n\nThe entirety of Valinor is swept up in the flames and chaos of the war between the various religious cults. The garrison is no longer capable to suppress them.\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\"Quite a sad spectacle, I guess it\u0027s about time to head home?\" ask Bomboulos who rides next to you. Together you watch the thick smoke rise above Valinor, as the order of the Golden Sun makes a strategical retreat while being escorted by your personal guard. It seems things didn\u0027t work out as well as you had originally hoped. Grandpa was right, after all, religious cults are nothing but an eyesore. Now it\u0027s time to repent and think up a few really good excuses, for when you go whine against your father. It\u0027s a parents job to clean up the mess of their sole child, right?\n\n\nThe only problem is that you\u0027ve really outdone yourself this time around and created the biggest mess in your whole life. Since no mediator or diplomat has any chance to solve the current problems in Valinor, your father has no other choice than to send an army and raze the whole city to the ground. It could still be considered a happy end. But unfortunately your suggestion about, \u0027Let\u0027s all forget about it,\u0027 isn\u0027t followed by your father. So you\u0027re grounded and even worse, you lose your throne.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

You and the other members of your knight order are in the wide courtyard of the castle, practicing shooting... at immobile targets that don\u0027t fight back. Well, that\u0027s why they call it practicing after all. And you\u0027re attentively watching him, not because he told you so or that you believe that he\u0027s going to hit the target this time. But because it will be the 100th arrow he\u0027s going to fire this afternoon.

Immediately a nearby servant passes along the next loaded crossbow, while another servant takes the throwaway crossbow from the ground and reloads it.

But this time he isn\u0027t going to waste any time blaming the servant for that since it seems to be an emergency.\n\n\nBomboulos goes pale and begins to tremble, as he\u0027s beginning to fear for the worst. \"A-A d-disaster?

So you gesture the servant to continue and Bomboulos to shut up for a moment.\n\n\n\"Multiple people have contracted a strange sickness in the port area. Judging by the similar symptoms so many patients have in such a short timespan, we fear it might be a... plague,\" reports the servant, while he falls on his knees. \"We have tried to isolate them as best as we could, but it\u0027s hard to tell who\u0027s already infected and who\u0027s not.\"\n\n\nIf there\u0027s one thing you don\u0027t wish to see in a medieval world with its unreliable doctors, it\u0027s definitely a plague.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

Although the panic and increased taxes, to fill the empty treasury, significantly weaken the kingdom, it remains spared of the plague. But the plague never spreads further than Valinor and dies off rather quickly. Karadas seizes Valinor for itself and during the isolation period of Lorimur it has managed to greatly strengthen itself and became the continent\u0027s new superpower.\n\n\nSo the great nation of Lorimur is slowly pushed out of the race, to control the continent. It\u0027s power and influence grow weaker by the year. Your great contribution in bringing the news of the plague in a timely manner secured you the throne and Lorimur is now yours. But this is little cause for celebration. Your great kingdom is only a shade of its former self and what it possibly could have been.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Do You even need to ask?

You\u0027re wearing your usual clothes. An elegant white dress, adorned with sapphires. Together with your favorite slippers. When you arrive, the same boring breakfast awaits. It consists of a dozen delicacies, imported from heavens may know where. Together with some cooled fruit juice and tea, it becomes edible.\n\n\nWhen you\u0027re done tasting the dishes, the leftovers are for the dogs or the servants. Not that much of a difference, anyway. You follow Frederic through the long hallway. You can see the garden through the mosaic glass of the windows, as you walk by. Every servant or guard you encounter on the way always seems to be so busy, hurrying along to somewhere. But as soon as they spot you, they have more than enough time to bow, grovel and spew flattery. So it makes you wonder, if they\u0027re actually so busy in the first place and why they\u0027re running around as if their legs are on fire?\n\n\nThen you arrive before the stairs leading to the eastern wing of the palace, where your father\u0027s study is located. Quite unusual, parties are organized in the hall or the garden, and official stuff is handled in the throne room. You have only visited your fathers study a few times before and each time your father wasn\u0027t exactly pleased with you. For example, the time you decided to host a BBQ in the royal library and almost burned it down to the ground. Or the time you floored the ambassador of Culin, which led to a diplomatic incident. Or the time you screamed, \u0027Party like there\u0027s no tomorrow, it\u0027s all on the treasury!\u0027 Anyway, it will be the usual, \u0027Don\u0027t abuse your authority, be a kind and righteous ruler... and so on,\u0027 After the sermon, you can head back and forget all about it, like always.\n\n\nWhile you were lost in your thoughts, you have already have arrived before your father\u0027s study. Frederic opens the wooden door before you and bows, while he announces you. \"Your Majesty, Her royal Highness has arrived.\"\n\n\nYou walk into the study, while Frederic closes the door behind you, in order to provide his masters with some privacy. It\u0027s a large study, more a library than an office by the way. Bookcase after bookcase rises up before you, while the sunlight comes in through the large rounded windows. In the center of the room, there\u0027s a large desk, covered in documents and letters. An old man stands near the window, with his back towards you. He\u0027s wearing a magnificent crown on his head and a wide robe over his shoulders. It\u0027s your esteemed father, King Karlor Lanash. Slowly he turns around and solemnly gazes at you. Although he isn\u0027t that old yet, his hair and beard already have become white and deep wrinkles are visible on his face. Some say, your father carries the fate of the entire kingdom on his back. But personally, you disagree. The old man simply gets up way too early and doesn\u0027t get enough sleep.\n\n\nHis posture radiates an almost tangible authority and power. It\u0027s like a formless pressure that always weighs down on you when you confront your father. You have inherited the looks from your mother, heavens have her soul, but you possess your father\u0027s eyes. And it\u0027s those same eyes that are now focused on you. As you feel the stern gaze of the king press down on you, you unconsciously shiver. For a moment you instinctively want to confess whatever you did wrong this time. But no matter how much you strain your memory, nothing comes to mind. Then your father sighs, \"Will I ever witness the day, you\u0027re on time for once?... Anyway, I called you here today to discuss an important matter. But first, let me ask you a question. What do you think, is the most important thing a kingdom needs?\"\n\n\n\"Uuu...\" Some things come to mind, like parties, money, soldiers, more parties, subjects, a large palace, and even more parties. But you\u0027re quite sure that your father would disagree if you mentioned any of these.\n\n\n\"A strong and decisive ruler! There are many kingdoms on this continent, some posses many resources, or have a strategic location, or have a large abundance of vital trade routes. Yet our kingdom, that lacks all of these, prospered and outstripped its competitors. How? Through sheer military force, we have conquered almost a third of the entire continent and have become one of its largest powers. How was such a thing possible? Because your great grandfather was one of the greatest and most fearless knights that have ever existed. He forged the famous knight order, unified the lands and carved a future for a small and weak nation with his sword.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, father I know, basic history lessons...\" The story of the common knight, that crowned himself king and became the most famous warlord of his age.

But judging from Orlag\u0027s curious expression, as he\u0027s attentively listening. It seems you\u0027re not the only person wondering about his motives. Then he continues, \"Isn\u0027t that obvious? Bravery and chivalry run through my blood! How could I not partake in this epic journey?\"\n\n\nYou know this guy well enough to know, that he\u0027s lying through his teeth. Chivalry?

It seems he didn\u0027t expect such a nonsensical answer. Anyway, even if dragons truly existed, you would never take this guy along.\n\n\nFinally, he admits the truth. \"My old man forced me. I had to choose between not inheriting the family\u0027s fortune and joining the order.\" Well, you can kind of understand what he\u0027s going through, so you drop the subject.\n","page 27":"Then everything goes lightening-fast, like a nightmare everything rushes by. An hour later, you\u0027re in the courtyard, wearing an armor that looks awfully similar to the one in your recent dream. How dearly you wish this was just a dream now and you could just wake up.\n\n\nYou\u0027re aroused from your thoughts when suddenly a young knight, only a few years older than you, approaches you and makes a fluid military salute. He has short brown hair, standard military cut. He has a faint scar above his left brow and has a steady and confident posture. All together he gives the impression to be quite experienced and reliable. The only odd thing is his gray eyes, for a moment you thought you saw an amused glint in them. Must be your imagination, because when he introduces himself he sounds respectful enough. \"It\u0027s an honor to meet you, Your Highness. I thought the tales and songs about your great beauty were exaggerated, please forgive me for my foolishness. I\u0027m sir Orlag Gonnar and I have been bestowed the honor to assist you in your noble quest.\"\n\n\nIf you ignore the flattery, you can conclude this Orlag fellow is your appointed bodyguard. Which immediately raises a few questions. Firstly, is this bloke as reliable as he looks? Only the most accomplished may serve you, not just every wannabe-knight. Secondly, how much does he know about your situation and your mandatory quest? But most importantly, why is he alone? One measly knight is going to be nowhere enough if we\u0027re heading to somewhere dangerous! \"I\u0027m counting on you, I guess. But where are the other body... I mean members of our order?\"\n\n\nWhen Orlag hears your question, his face distorts for a second, then his calmness returns. \"They\u0027re here as well, we were waiting for you, Your Highness. But... perhaps a short warning is appropriate, the knight order was formed very recently. So most of our members are still... trying to fit in. Please follow me, your highness, I will introduce them to you.\" After giving this weird warning, Orlag leads you towards the rest of the knights.\n\n\nFurther away, you spot a short fat man, around your age, sitting on a magnificent white steed. He has short black hair and dark brown eyes. He has the same type of plate armor as you but is wearing a wide array of jewelry on top of it. Five golden necklaces and a dozen golden rings on his fingers, with a gemstone embedded in each of them. He is riding his horse with two golden slippers on his feet. His face is becoming red as he\u0027s agitatedly screaming at the nearby servants. \"Whaat!! You complete and utter imbeciles didn\u0027t bring my glass chessboard, my exquisite sofa, my collection of fine paintings, my...\"\n\n\nThe servants desperately try to calm their master. \"Please calm your anger, my lord. We were ordered to only bring you the bare essentials for your journey. I-I brought you your riding boots, please wear them instead of your slippers!\"\n\n\nBut instead of calming down, it seems he only flares up even more. \"You ignorant dimwit! I\u0027m talking about the bare essentials! Besides I don\u0027t need those distasteful boots!\"\n\n\nOrlag carefully glances at you and then scrapes his throat. \"Uhm, Your Highness,...this young lord here is one of your companions.\"\n\n\n\"You can spare yourself the trouble to introduce him, I know him better than I would like to admit.\" Bloody hell, of course, you know this guy! There\u0027s only one, who wears golden slippers when he\u0027s riding a horse. He\u0027s the only person, who can utterly crush you at an eating competition. It\u0027s your best buddy, Bomboulos Zannar, the only son of the arch-duke. Together with him, you raised hell in the palace. So you\u0027re fairly close. But, just because you know him so well, you\u0027re not happy at all. His skills with the sword are even more terrible than yours... when you were five years old. So you can\u0027t expect him to play the role of a body-guard.\n\n\nThen Bomboulos spots you and immediately his rage subsides. He directs his horse towards you and manages to remain in the saddle when the horse stops before you. \"Great to see you boss Elsia! They certainly gave us a few worthless servants.\"\n\n\nYou return his greeting, \"Great to see you too, Bomboulos,...\"\n","page 20":"\"Yes and? From all the excuses I expected from you, this is by far the poorest. Every noble with the rank of Earl and above may grant somebody knighthood in return for exceptional service.

At first, they\u0027re quite successful and it seems they\u0027ll be able to swiftly eradicate it, but then the plague keeps resurfacing more and more frequently. As more citizens get infected, the contaminated area gradually expands and eventually, the whole city is placed under lockdown. In order to combat the ever-increasing treat more efficiently, the Silent Watcher begin to work together with the garrison and your personal guard. Unfortunately, they seem to have been less careful than the Silent Watchers when handling the plague and soon there\u0027s an outbreak amongst the soldiers of Lorimur. Fear and chaos spread through their ranks, destabilizing the situation even more. The captain of your personal guard even has to resort to executing some of his subordinates in an attempt to maintain order.\n\n\nAlthough you and your friends try to isolate yourselves from the downward spiral of madness, in the end, it reaches even the high and mighty. After a night of eating and drinking, you wake up and feel sick. Soon you are diagnosed to have the same symptoms and the Silent Watchers appear before you, in order to clean you up. Of course, they fail, they\u0027re cut to pieces by your personal guard, or what still remains of it. \"Nobody touches Her Highness! We\u0027ll follow you to the gates of hell!\" yells Dovar.\n\n\nWell, their loyalty is admirable, but this time they follow you to hell for real. A week later, you pass away and your guards follow you.

If you\u0027re going to entrust it to someone, then it has to be at least somebody that sounds like he knows what he\u0027s talking about. On your orders, Fozir begins to inspect the patients and unexpectedly he returns rather quickly. He looks agitated and his face is somewhat paler. It looks like he has failed and he\u0027s unable to treat this disease.\n\n\n\"My lady, can I talk to you somewhere... more private?\" That\u0027s the first thing he asks. Well, why not? As long as he keeps a large enough distance, it shouldn\u0027t be a problem. So along with a dozen of your trusted soldiers, you accompany Fozir to an isolated room. Once there he begins his rather shocking story.\n\n\n\"My lady, don\u0027t be afraid. I\u0027m not infected at all, besides not a single one of these patients are infected. There is no plague in Valinor, it\u0027s a poison! One that has been carefully administered in the foods and drinks of the patients. I investigated what they were eating and found this odd substance in it. It gives you symptoms that very closely resemble the Black Death and it\u0027s undoubtedly lethal, but it\u0027s unmistakably a poison!\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s impossible...\"\n\n\n\"At first I had difficulties too, in accepting the facts laid out before me. Did you know there were a few people who went aboard on the merchant ship in question? Their supervisor got bitten by a rat, yet he\u0027s the only person who\u0027s still completely healthy. Can you guess why? Because he was afraid he might have been infected, he didn\u0027t eat along with his subordinates and holed himself up inside his home. The person who certainly should have been infected is fine because he didn\u0027t touch the food! I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s some kind of merciless scheme being plotted from the shadows. Somebody seems to think he or she can benefit from destabilizing Valinor.\"\n\n\nThen a sudden sharp pain flashes through your hand and you hear the sound of glass shattering. Blood drips from your hand, along with the broken pieces of your glass. Due to your sudden fury, you subconsciously crushed the glass of wine you were holding. How dare they? Scheming against you? Or merely trying to scare you? Who would dare to play you, the crown princess of Lorimur, for a fool!!! The answer is obvious, who arrogantly strolled in as soon as the plague broke out? Who let the so-called cause \u0027break through their blockade\u0027? Who encountered the disease first? Who was practically begging you to hand over your authority to them, in order to fight the plague? Those damned masked scarecrows, it was all a tad bit too convenient for them!\n\n\nSurprised Fozir backs off, while your soldiers nervously gaze at each other. They have witnessed multiple of your rage-tantrums over the years but never was it this kind of towering wrath.

Screams echo throughout the streets as the members of the order are beaten to a bloody pulp and anybody who tries to run away get his legs broken. With a broken nose, a cloven lip and a shattered knee, the leader of the Silent Watchers loses his consciousness and is imprisoned.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nThree hours later, something similar happens in the northern village, where the plague first broke out. Since the villagers have already long been massacred by the Silent Watchers, there\u0027s no problem in attacking with full force. Under the light of the setting sun, the village is completely surrounded by cavalry. Without a word of warning, they charge the village from all directions, while the unfortunate lookout gets crushed beneath their hooves. The doors get battered down with axes and then the soldiers start searching every nook and cranny. A moment later a badly bruised old man, wearing alchemist robes, is dragged out.

He\u0027s unusually stubborn this time, you guess he must have had some bad experiences with traditional medieval treatment.\n\n\n\"My lady, I think your joke is misplaced,\" says the Beholder. It seems he has difficulties holding his laughter. \"What\u0027s he going to do? Apply leeches? Eat garlic? Cut up an animal and rub its blood on a patient? A potion brewed from his own excrement?\"\n\n\n\"No, you shouldn\u0027t expect so much from an ordinary countryside doctor, only the real masters hired by my family are capable of that,\" says Bomboulos. Well, you learned something today, never get treatment at the Zannar manor.\n\n\nOrlag gives Bomboulos a weird glance, seemingly unsure whether that was just an inappropriate joke or he was bloody serious. \"Anyway, the point is that we can\u0027t just let any nobody deal with a plague, that will only cause it to spread even further.

How long is the incubation period? How was the disease transmitted? These need to be carefully analyzed, if we wish to have any chance of stopping this disease from propagating. Then I\u0027ll search in the medical records for diseases with similar symptoms, and attempt to find a cure by mixing various medical herbs and testing it on the infected patients. Although this might sound heartless, these kinds of experiments will drastically increase the chance of finding a cure.\"\n\n\nThen Fozir slowly walks towards you, under the stupefied gazes of the others, and bows before you. \"I\u0027m here my lady, at your service. But first I must warn you, I\u0027m afraid that we stand little to no chance of stopping this plague. From the symptoms I heard so far, this seems to be a strain of the \u0027Septicemic plague\u0027 or better known as the \u0027Black Death\u0027. Humans are not the primary vector responsible for spreading it, fleas and rodents are the main cause. So quarantining or killing the infected patients won\u0027t be effective in stopping the plague. It pains me to admit it, but we simply lack the means to control the rodent population, so the plague will keep resurfacing. Although I\u0027ll do my utmost to find a cure, I\u0027m afraid there will soon be too many patients for me to handle.\"\n\n\nBomboulos and Tyrwill just stare at Fozir blankly, his monologue got a bit too complicated for them. They\u0027re quite lucky because his prediction gives you the chills. Doesn\u0027t that mean that we\u0027re all doomed? It\u0027s scarier when somebody calmly explains why we\u0027re all doomed than having one crazy clown screaming it. But if you have to choose between Fozir\u0027s plan and the kill-them-all plan of the Silent Watchers, it\u0027s quite obvious which one of the two to pick.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

With their catapults, they begin to bombard the city walls. Once in a while, a lost projectile flies over the walls and lands between the houses, causing further destruction and chaos. Unfortunately, the walls aren\u0027t wide enough to support any catapults. So they have to fire from behind the walls or from the limited place on the castle. To make things even worse, you don\u0027t have as many catapults as the enemy. So in this back and forth exchange of rock boulders, you\u0027re a bit at a disadvantage. Well the cover of the wall, makes up for it. And at the moment, the peasants have gotten the exclusive honor to stand at the front. So the few lucky hits that the enemy lands aren\u0027t that disastrous.\n\n\nThen the siege towers are rolled forward and the peasants are relieved of their honor. Multiple groups of enemy soldiers carry large ladders with them and are planning to place them between the siege towers. According to Dovar, they plan to attempt to overwhelm the defenders, by getting as quickly as possible as many soldiers on the walls as possible. \"Nothing to worry about,\" he says. \"They\u0027re the arrow-fodder of the enemy, primary intended to draw the focus away from the siege towers. Those are manned by their elite soldiers.\" The defender\u0027s release volley after volley at the charging soldiers, you gave every peasant a bow for this. Their accuracy might be lacking a bit, but if they miss one soldier they might hit the one next to him. At least that was the theory. Unfortunately thanks to their poor shooting technique, most arrows don\u0027t even reach the enemy ranks.\n\n\nSince the siege towers are armored, fire arrows are used on them. A few towers transform into giant torches. But due to the wet animal skins on their surfaces, most roll towards the walls almost unhindered. In the meantime, the ladders have already been placed against the wall. While holding their shield above them, to protect them against incoming arrows and stones, the soldiers of Karadas begin their suicidal climb to the tilts. They\u0027re suffering heavy casualties, multiple ladders get pushed away. Screams echo over the battlefield when the boiling oil is poured down. When the first one reaches the top, he immediately receives a sword through his visor and falls backward. Then more and more soldiers begin to climb up the walls and the battle intensifies.\n\n\nWhen the siege towers are getting close to the wall, you see that the enemy is rolling forth an enormous battering ram. It seems they have waited until they could pressure the whole defensive line. But you don\u0027t have any time to worry about that, because the bridge of a nearby siege towers falls on the walls. After withstanding another volley, the soldiers of Karadas charge out.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nYou\u0027re standing near the back, behind the cover of your guards. The screams echo in your ears, the nauseating scent of blood drifts over you. A peasant keeps hitting a corpse of an enemy soldier, with a crazed look in his eyes, as if he wants to avenge his fallen comrades. Then he gets beheaded by another soldier of Karadas.\n\n\nAll in all, the most disturbing sight you have ever witnessed. Luckily a servant stands beside you to serve you a cold drink and fans some fresh air. Then a soldier breaks through the lines, but he\u0027s quickly surrounded and receives a sword in his throat. Blood drips out of his mouth and when the sword is pulled out, a stream of blood sprays out. It seems his carotid artery was hit. How terrifying! If it weren\u0027t for your soldiers their shields, some of the blood might have stained your armor.\n\n\nSomewhere to the right of you, the defenders are being pushed back, more and more enemies are streaming on the walls. A tall man, with a fierce red beard and armed with a giant axe, seems to be forcing a breakthrough and begins to sweep his surroundings clean. After he kills the soldiers of Lorimur, there are only a few peasants left on that segment of the wall. If you don\u0027t act, you\u0027ll lose the whole wall.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

I bought my knighthood for a measly 1000 golden crowns, didn\u0027t know it was that cheap,\" says Bomboulos.\n\n\n\"What! You\u0027re telling me that you just bought your title and didn\u0027t earn it through your achievements?\" asks Orlag. You have no clue why he seems so indignant, one look at somebody like Bomboulos is enough to know he didn\u0027t earn his title.\n\n\n\"I deserved the title the day I was born, I merely paid an administrative fee to accelerate the formalities,\" defends Bomboulos himself. That might be true, the Zannar family would even charge their own blood.\n\n\n\"Perhaps you did, but I haven\u0027t bought it!\" yells Tyrwill, while she shows a triumphant smile. \"I got it as a present from my daddy!\"\n\n\nThen Orlag grows visibly agitated while he glances at Hallas and Fariera. You can bet Hallas either stole his title or falsified some documents and you may hang if Fariera got her title legitimately. So perhaps it\u0027s time to change the subject?\n","page 207":"\"But without our expertise...,\" protests the Beholder.\n\n\n\"Then I\u0027ll allow you to be my sidekick,\" do you say, while you cut him off. Now he should just shut up and be happy with the great honor you have bestowed on him.\n\n\nYou mount your horse, while your new sidekick follows you along with the rest of your entourage. A bit later you reach the dock area where the plague has been momentarily contained. It seems the word about the plague has already gone around and the streets in this area of the city are completely deserted. All the peasants must have already fled to another part of the city or locked themselves inside their homes, too afraid to come out.

I didn\u0027t have that many options you see, every member more or less voiced his or her... preference and I had to make do! Lord Bomboulos said he didn\u0027t care as long as the word \u0027gold\u0027 was in the name. Lady Tyrwill demanded it would be something warm because she hates the cold. Lady Fariera\u0027s only demand was, that it needed to be something the people looked up to. Something unreachable high above them. Lord Hallas was sleeping during the discussion and... I didn\u0027t feel the need to wake him up. To please everybody, I settled on \u0027The order of the Golden Sun.\u0027 I know the name may not be exactly as aesthetically pleasing as you may have hoped.\"\n\n\n\"...\" Who would have thought, the knight order is only a day old and it already has a story behind it.

Quite a shock, it was, I had to repeat so many boring lines...\" Of course, you crush such hopes immediately. But your friends don\u0027t mind it. In fact, as soon as you start complaining, Bomboulos gets motivated too. He begins to tell about his tiring knighting experience and everything that came with it. Well not that surprising, aside from spouting insults and eating, everything is tiring to him.\n\n\nOrlag simply shrugs disillusioned and walks back. Perhaps it\u0027s for the best he didn\u0027t get any high hopes for this knight order.\n","page 209":"The majority of the people are so ignorant that they have never heard about your order before.

Us six are the entire knight order of the Golden Sun,\" says Orlag. \"We\u0027re the smallest knight order in the entire history of Lorimur. For your reference, the second smallest was the order of the nine Chosen Swords of the Heavens, and it was more like a cult consisting out of crazy fanatics.

Although it may not be that flattering, luckily your friends aren\u0027t discouraged by it.\n\n\n\"Oh a common peasant\u0027s mistake, they tend to only count the numbers,\" says Bomboulos.

And everybody always says I\u0027m the best,\" humps Tyrwill.\n\n\n\"And we got a future tyrant... I mean, famous person amongst us,\" says Fariera while she glances meaningfully at you. It seems Fariera has decided to pay attention to the discussion now. And oh, look! Hallas is waking up too. Perhaps he also knows something your knight order excels in.\n\n\n\"Uwhaa,\" yawns Hallas, while he scratches his back. \"Money, class, and style! Then we got the most important things down, on the other aspects we can just cheat.\" Instead of looking for the advantages, it seems he will focus on making up for the order\u0027s small short-comings.

They\u0027re over there!\" says Bomboulos, while he points over his shoulder. For a moment it looks like Orlag wants to correct him, but he changes his mind and simply sighs. Normally, the word \u0027gang\u0027 wouldn\u0027t be appropriate when speaking about a knight order, but now it kind of fits. Because behind Bomboulos, you can see the rest of your buddies.\n\n\nLady Tyrwill Remenir, who\u0027s struggling with climbing on her horse, while wearing a long dress with large frills. Four maids are frantically trying to assist her, while another servant keeps the horse on a leash. Due to a lack of success, she loses her patience and pushes her blond curls aside and yells, \"I want to ride the horse, help me!! Or I will tell daddy, how useless you all are!\" Although she\u0027s quite pretty, her spoiled rotten nature kind of ruins it. And if even someone like you has that opinion, then it\u0027s really serious. She\u0027s a real flower groomed in a greenhouse. You could probably attempt to persuade her to give up, but she\u0027s even more stubborn than your old man and even dumber than Bomboulos. So you probably have to give up.\n\n\nWhile the servants are fetching a ladder for her, you focus on the next person. Hallas Fjornhell, the only person who can\u0027t even beat Bomboulos in a fight. He has long brown hair hanging over his pale face and a slim build. He\u0027s a dirty cheat and his only talent is running away from something dangerous. Although he himself, calls it strategically retreating, perhaps he\u0027s right. He\u0027s the unmatched champion in it, so he may know better. According to rumors his family controls the entire underworld of the kingdom. Although his methods are quite underhanded, you can trust him as long as you never show him your back. He\u0027s currently sleeping on a nearby chair, loudly snoring. Well, you gotta give it to him. It\u0027s still early, it\u0027s not even noon yet!\n\n\nSo you decide to let Hallas get his rest and turn towards the last person. Lady Fariera Cillis, the one and only daughter of the bloody duchess. According to the rumors, her mother painted the streets red when she executed everybody who disagreed with her surrender to Lorimur. Although she looks like a courageous mature lady with her flaming red hair, she inherited her mothers snake-like personality. Fiery and bloody, to say the least. Anyway, at the moment, she\u0027s looking in a mirror and applying lipstick. Everybody has his or her priorities and her number one priority was always her appearance.\n\n\nBomboulos, Tyrwill, Hallas and Fariera, the sons and daughters of the wealthy and powerful. And you always were the leader of this group, because you\u0027re totally awesome of course! Being the sole heir to the throne is only a small unimportant detail. Under normal circumstances, you might have been glad to see them. But unfortunately, they all share the same short-coming, none of them are knights. So you voice your doubts. \"Since when are you all knights?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, Since yesterday. I bought my knighthood for a measly 1000 golden crowns, didn\u0027t know it was that cheap,\" says Bomboulos.\n\n\n\"What! You\u0027re telling me that you just bought your title and didn\u0027t earn it through your achievements?\" asks Orlag. You have no clue why he seems so indignant, one look at somebody like Bomboulos is enough to know he didn\u0027t earn his title.\n\n\n\"I deserved the title the day I was born, I merely paid an administrative fee to accelerate the formalities,\" defends Bomboulos himself.

You can bet Hallas either stole his title or falsified some documents and you may hang if Fariera got her title legitimately. So perhaps it\u0027s time to change the subject?\n","page 30":"\"Why would I do that? A peasant wears clogs, a merchant wears shoes, a beggar nothing and a fine nobleman like me slippers!\"\n\n\n\"But a knight wears boots and certainly when he or she is riding a horse,\" says Orlag in a desperate attempt to get the point across.\n\n\n\"Hmm, I see that you don\u0027t know the ways of the world. That\u0027s only true for knights riding \u0027common\u0027 horses, not for \u0027noble\u0027 ones. I\u0027m riding on a horse, who\u0027s noble lineage dates back for over six generations! So it\u0027s only appropriate that I\u0027m wearing this.\" The way he says that so smugly, as if he understands the outside world so much better, truly makes you want to hit him.\n\n\nBut there\u0027s not much anybody can do against such broken logic, so Orlag can only look up in frustration. Meanwhile, the noble horse only seems to silently say, \u0027Stop screaming and moving, fatso!\u0027 But that would only be in case, it could really speak.\n","page 330":"Suddenly a group of knights charge up the walls and drive the soldiers of Karadas back. \"Ha ha! Did you really think you would have to face these guys by yourself?\" laughs Fladius. He jumps before you. \"Listen I don\u0027t like Lorimur at all, but you\u0027re an exception. I\u0027ll never abandon a fellow knight! Brothers and sisters of the sword, charge! Teach them a lesson!\" Then he charges towards the axe-wielding barbarian and defeats him, while the other knights reclaim the wall.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

He\u0027s far too frail to be a farmer, and way too clean. In fact, he looks more like a scholar with that pointy beard of his. He\u0027s yelling, \"How no! My precious research materials, my ingredients!\" While somebody that looks like his student is desperately trying to salvage whatever still can be saved. Books, herbs, broken bottles, weird looking objects and all kinds of junk are all over the place. Judging by the sheer amount of stuff, the wagon was probably overloaded. That and suddenly trying to turn it around had this accident as a result.\n\n\nThe city guards by the gate are flustered. One of them angry reproaches the scholar. \"Fozir! Damn charlatan! We already told you, you\u0027re not allowed to enter the city! And what kind of mess is this? Why now, when those dangerous looking...\" Then he spots you and quickly changes his tone. \"...these noble knights have arrived, why inconvenience them so? Please have a bit of patience, o noble knight, we will solve this as soon as we can.\"\n\n\nAs soon as the student hears the guard, he jolts up. \"How dare you call master Fozir a charlatan! He\u0027s a great alchemist, his work...\"\n\n\n\"...Isn\u0027t even worth a copper crown! Now get your junk together and piss off, before I have to throw you into prison!\" screams the guard. Then he continues his groveling. \"My noble lords and ladies, I deeply apologize...\"\n\n\nBut suddenly Bomboulos comes forward, it seems his interest has been picked. \"Hey, you! Are you really an alchemist?\"\n\n\nThen the alchemist finally shifts his attention from his overturned cart to your group. \"Ah?... Yes, my lord. Allow me to introduce myself, I\u0027m Fozir, a seeker of knowledge and truth. Alchemy is just one of my various fields of study...\"\n\n\n\"Yes, yes, I don\u0027t really care about the rest,\" says Bomboulos, while he waves his hand. \"If you\u0027re an alchemist that must mean you can create gold right? Or you\u0027re at least trying to research how to make it?\" It\u0027s unbelievable, he\u0027s already so rich and he\u0027s still so eager for more gold. Well, that mentality is probably why the Zannar family got so rich in the first place.\n\n\n\"Are you perhaps talking about the philosophers stone, my lord?\" asks Fozir. Then he suddenly begins to laugh. \"Puhaha, that\u0027s just a fairy tale, such a thing doesn\u0027t exist! Harboring futile hopes for eternal life and an infinite source of gold is nothing more than an utter waste of time. I must admit, my lord, you have a very good sense of humor.\"\n\n\nBut Bomboulos isn\u0027t the type to crack jokes when gold is involved. So when he hears the alchemist isn\u0027t even going to try to make gold, his interest dies off quickly. \"Hmp, ignorant fool! Not trying to make gold when you\u0027re an alchemist, that\u0027s an utter waste of time. And it\u0027s an utter waste of my time to talk to a charlatan like you!\"\n\n\n\"B-But my lord, I have various other tangible accomplishments in other fields, like medicine, astrology, and mathematics. As you can read in my collected work,\" does Fozir say while he grabs a thick book from the pile.\n\n\nOf course, Bomboulos has no interest in books, so he completely ignores him. Then Tyrwill laughs, \"Like that is anything special, anybody could write a book!\" While Hallas is nodding and smiling with a smirk on his face.\n\n\nThis piques your interest though, so you ask, \"What kind of books have you written?\"\n\n\n\"...None, but I definitely could, if I ever felt like it!\" Well, there\u0027s your answer, not that surprising.

Outside the tent, a group of nobles and generals have been gathered together. Their conversation immediately halts when the king of Lorimur arrives.

Slowly his gaze wanders over the plain and the rows and rows of marching soldiers, the banner of Lorimur high in the sky. \"Now the time has come to pay the price for my foolishness and pray for forgiveness for my mistakes.

So it\u0027s your father\u0027s property in a certain way, but he isn\u0027t here. Here nobody tells you what you should or shouldn\u0027t do. Okay, they do, but you can completely ignore it and pretend they didn\u0027t say anything. It\u0027s a new kind of freedom, and frankly said, you begin to like the taste of it.\n\n\nSo life is good and well, but also a tad bit boring.

He isn\u0027t completely wrong, but you\u0027re pretty sure that \u0027eating\u0027 isn\u0027t something exclusively for knights.

It wasn\u0027t always that easy, but gradually the people got used to the somewhat eccentric knights of the Golden Sun. They are by no means perfect knight or rulers, not by a long shot. But the peasants have seen worse, much worse. So long as the high and mighty don\u0027t cause too much trouble for the commoners, they don\u0027t care that much for who\u0027s actually in power.\n\n\nSo life goes on, stable and safe... Okay, perhaps not exactly safe. With the arrival of spring, the local bandit gangs crawl again out of their holes and flock towards the poorly defended villages, like a flock of locusts. It seems as if these annoying bandits will keep you busy your whole life.\n\n\nLuckily this time around, they seem far less elusive than that bandit you dealt with when you arrived here, the one called Ragnar.

Although he\u0027s strangely eager to undertake this task, it will spare you and your friends the hassle. So you agree to his request. Orlag then rides out with a few dozen soldiers and a week later he returns. It seems he did have some more trouble with the bandits than expected, but eventually, he managed to deal with them.

And why so early in the morning?\n\n\n\"Your Highness, we\u0027ve been completely caught off guard.

Not that surprising that he hasn\u0027t been caught yet. \"Bomboulos, do you have any spare change?\"\n\n\n\"Eh? Not much boss,\" says Bomboulos, while he fetches a pouch and drops it on the table. A few hundred gold crowns roll over the wooden surface, stupefying the nobles present. What are they surprised about?

It\u0027s been a bit of a rough winter, even harsher than the other years. The main reason? The arrival of the knight order of the Golden Sun. Their unbridled arrogance and overbearing behavior have made life inside Valinor more and more difficult for the common people. They treat the city, as if it\u0027s a mere extension of Lorimur and pay no heed to its rightful rulers or the plight of its people. The soldiers, wearing the crest of Lorimur, freely terrorize the streets and the garrison has gotten increasingly cruel over the past few months. It\u0027s as if this \u0027Lady Elsia\u0027 seems to think her privileges and authority have no bounds whatsoever. But spring brings hope, hope for change and a better future. Yet it\u0027s hope that makes people do foolish things or try to achieve the unthinkable. Slowly everybody can feel it in the air, the brewing unrest, smoldering, simmering, like the calm before the incoming storm.\n\n\n--------\n\n\nThe people on the streets gather together in small groups and argue agitatedly. Occasionally there\u0027s a rioter that jumps on a wooden box and tries to rile the crowd up. But they are swiftly detained by the soldiers of Lorimur, so that they have the opportunity to \u0027formally state their complaints\u0027. Of course after filling in an \u0027official complaint\u0027, nobody ever hears or sees them ever again. In the taverns, the drunks loudly complain about the knights of the Golden Sun. The next day, they are usually found lying in the gutter, half beaten to death. The shop of a merchant, who claimed the knight order was bad for businesses, got burned to the ground overnight. He demanded justice from the noble council, but was quickly detained and accused of tax evasion and spreading false rumors. A noble that claimed, that some dishonorable knights were overstepping their bounds, went missing during a hunting competition. Either a wild beast got him or another hunter accidentally shot an arrow in his back.\n\n\nEvery single day, the population inside the dungeons of Valinor grows. But it seems that every attempt to silence the voices, criticizing the order of the Golden Sun, fails. For every person that learns to keep his or her mouth shut, another ten start raising objections and questions. Although the soldiers of Lorimur do everything to extinguish the sparks of a possible rebellion, their actions only seem to pour more oil on the fire. Soon it will transform into an all-encompassing inferno, that will swallow even the mightiest.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

Your father quickly organizes a reprisal army, in order to crush the rebellion before it\u0027s too late. But the army fails to reconquer Valinor in time and they are ambushed during the siege by Karadas. The army is forced to retreat after suffering grievous losses, it\u0027s a complete defeat. The rebellion of Valinor inspires many other vassal states, that were suppressed by Lorimur. It soon becomes a legend, how the tiny city-state resisted the huge warmongering kingdom and was saved by Karadas. It\u0027s like David and Goliath, the dwarf teaching the giant a lesson. Multiple provinces of Lorimur declare themselves independent and wish to regain their former glory from before they were conquered. Lorimur becomes chaotic and while its armies are busy settling the unrest, all of its vassal states see an opportunity to break free. Karadas promises these former vassal states protection and guarantees that it will make sure the other kingdoms respect their Independence. In exchange for joining into an alliance.\n\n\nWhen the dust finally settles, the once so mighty kingdom of Lorimur, that harbored dreams of ruling the entire continent, has been reduced to only a third of its former size. Your father aged during the past few month more than in two decades. The struggle to keep as much as he could, has completely worn him out. He practically stands with one foot in the grave, but the throne will never be yours. A joke of an heir that\u0027s what you are, one that almost completely doomed the entire kingdom, all because of her absurd pride. Once your father hears about you wildly abusing your authority and twisting his trail to such an extent, he only has a few words for you. \"Disappear from my sight and never, ever come back!\"\n\n\nSince it looks like Lorimur is doomed anyway, it might be for the best. You flee the kingdom and set sail to the Mordurian isles, a place of freedom and opportunity. After your father passes away, one of your cousins ascends the throne, while boot-licking Karadas. It seems the day that Lorimur will become a vassal state is not far off anymore.\n\n\n--------\n\n[POV switch]\n\n\nA few years later, quite a distance away from the Mordurian isles, a large fleet of black ships lies anchored in a deserted bay. A giant skull is painted on the sails. It\u0027s the most dangerous pirate group that has ever sailed the seas. They call themselves, \u0027The pirates of the Dark Sun\u0027. According to them, their glory was covered and their bright future turned dark. Like the moon covers the sun during a solar eclipse. When they fled their former home, a lot of their loyal-until-death soldiers followed them into exile. So once they arrived at the Mordurian isles, the famous pirate nest. They had no problem recruiting pirates to further fill up the empty spots in their ranks. During the past years, they plagued the seas, plundered merchant fleets, pillaged poorly defended port cities and amassed mountains of loot. Although it\u0027s almost unbelievable, these pirates can fight like hardened elite soldiers and are armed to the teeth. So after each consecutive victory, more and more pirates flocked under their banner and so the fleet had expanded. Until it had reached its current size. Now they are going ashore and enter a whole new, completely undiscovered and unknown land.\n\n\nThousands of pirates orderly march on the beach, tents are being set up. A group of core veterans are supervising them during the operation, it looks like they have been instilled with an iron discipline. Because the pirates behave more like an army, than most real armies would. Then a large stage is erected and slowly a mysterious woman ascends it, her presence alone is enough to silence all the pirates. \"Today a new chapter in my life will begin. I have decided to put the past behind me and move onwards to the future. I know some of you may have your doubts, about coming to these unknown and foreign lands, so terribly far away from home. But here a new future awaits us. From the information that I have gathered, these lands are far bigger than you would ever imagine and multiple savage tribes live here.\"\n\n\nThis causes some unrest among the pirates, but they maintain their ranks and keep silent. The woman beckons to a fat pirate, that\u0027s standing at the side. He steps forward and multiple prisoners in rags are dragged forward and forced to kneel. \"They\u0027re here, boss!\"\n\n\nWith a cold smile the woman resumes her speech. \"These are the natives of those savage tribes. I know everybody here probably has some questions, about their habits, their culture, are they hostile? But none of that matters. There\u0027s only one question that\u0027s important and if the answer is yes, all other questions become irrelevant. Whose the strongest? They, or us? They\u0027re armed with wooden clubs, they never have even heard of armor, they possess no crossbows, no siege equipment, no understanding of tactics and formations. These tribes are nothing more than large villages. So I believe everybody can guess the answer now.\"\n\n\n\"...And they have gold! Lot\u0027s of it too!\" laughs the fat pirate while he rubs his hands together.\n\n\n\"Ha ha, my mistake, that\u0027s also an important question. Besides these natives have no king or queen yet, so I have decided to help them out and fill up this position. Don\u0027t you all agree?\" asks the woman to the prisoners, her unusual appearance almost makes her look like a goddess in their eyes. And they quickly begin to grovel, as much as their chains allow them to.\n\n\n\"Wonderful! Follow me, burn the ships behind us and let\u0027s go conquer these lands!\"\n\n\nThen all the pirates release a loud cheer and begin to hammer on their shields with their weapons. Gold, slaughter and conquest are like music to their ears. \"Long live Queen Elsia! Eternal glory to the pirates of the Dark Sun!\"\n\n\n\"Now then, my kingdom awaits!\" laughs the woman with a murderous glare in her eyes.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

A few spies caught in the docks, a suspicious alchemist, the Silent Watchers and your \u0027friend\u0027 the Beholder. It\u0027s as if you\u0027re meeting him for the first time, now that his mask is missing and you hear his real name is Baron Clevis. He\u0027s a slim, ordinary looking man with brown hair. You must admit, that his bruised and beaten face is a lot more pleasing to look at than that empty mask.\n\n\nThe captain of your personal guard steps forward and summarizes what they managed to get out of them. \"My lady, the plague was a plot hatched by the filth of Karadas. The alchemist brewed a poison that could imitate plague symptoms. Baron Clevis of Karadas, set up this whole play. He disguised himself as a Silent Watcher and slaughtered the village to the north. He then attacked the merchant ship and let it drift in our direction. After his spies here confirmed who went aboard, they poisoned them first by mixing it in their food and drinks. Afterward, they gradually expanded their scope, to emulate the spread of a plague. Their goal was clearly to cause unrest in Valinor and destabilize your rule.\" After taking a quick look at the alchemist, that\u0027s almost wetting himself, Dovar continues. \"Mister Nervel has also been kind enough, to give us both the poison and the antidote.\"\n\n\nSo our baron Clevis is the \u0027official\u0027 ring leader and the true face hiding beneath the mask of the herald of death. Although you know he was only a pawn sent by Karadas, your revenge on Karadas will have to wait for now. These idiots that dared to lie and challenge your authority are going to die obviously, but how are you going to handle it?\n\n\nYou could tell everybody the truth for a change, you\u0027ll be famous and loved by the people of Valinor and it can serve as some fine anti-Karadas propaganda.

Merchants, who placed their stall somewhere they weren\u0027t permitted to, and people, who don\u0027t pay that much attention, end up getting in the way.

They\u0027re quite successful since they\u0027re using some solid arguments. To be more clear, their solid arguments consist of their cudgels, fists and iron boots. You have to talk to them in a way the peasants can understand. People run away as fast as they can, pushing each other away. Small merchant stalls get overturned and demolished. An old beggar that\u0027s a bit too slow, gets his leg broken. Hey!

It\u0027s as the servant claimed, below them, a group of knights enters the courtyard. And in their wake, row after row of heavy armored cavalry rides inside. A banner with a golden sun on it, high in their midst. Then a wave of servants and wagons ends the cologne. Bartolomeus shakes his head and sighs. \"What a show of force! What\u0027s the meaning of this?\"\n\n\n\"I think it is more than clear,\" says Sarokar, while he attentively gazes at the mass of soldiers. \"It\u0027s a warning and a message at the same time. A warning to its vassal not to step out of the line. Together with the garrison, we don\u0027t stand a chance. And a message to us, that our titles mean nothing in the eyes of the King of Lorimur. A knight of Lorimur can order around even more soldiers and possess even more authority than a duke of Valinor.\"\n\n\nWith a weary expression, Bartolomeus leans on the balustrade. \"Perhaps you\u0027re right or perhaps there are other schemes at play, we\u0027re not aware of. Anyway, one thing is certain, it seems Lorimur is going to strengthen its iron grip on our country...\"\n\n\n\"What is all that noise? Is there something happening in the city?\" asks Iselda the servant.\n\n\n\"My lady, it\u0027s because of the knights. Their soldiers are behaving like brutes, they are beating every citizen that doesn\u0027t move out of the way fast enough!\"\n\n\n\"What do these dogs of Lorimur think? That they own everything? They are clearly overstepping their bounds, even the garrison commander must see reason!\" Indignant, Iselda storms off. Bartolomeus tries to stop her but fails.\n","page 58":"[POV switch]\n\n\n\"...And I\u0027m telling you, it\u0027s not possible at the moment!\" yells a stately old man. He\u0027s sitting in a large hall, located on the upper floors of the royal castle. His hair and beard have already gone white. He\u0027s wearing traditional noble clothes and glaring through his monocle at the other two people in the hall.\n\n\n\"Why not? The safety of our people should always be our number one priority!\" asks a young woman. She\u0027s still very young, only sixteen years old. But she was the only one that could replace her father after he, unfortunately, passed away. She wears a light blue dress and the only piece of jewelry she carries is a delicate necklace. She has long blond hair, braided behind her back. Her icy blue eyes, furiously stare at the old noble.\n\n\nThen the old noble sighs and tries to calmly explain. \"We lack the manpower to comb out the entire forest, the farmers need to attend to their fields and we\u0027re short on soldiers since the last skirmish. Money to hire mercenaries is not something we can afford at the moment. Besides even if we could, it would not be a good idea to trust cretin like them. Coupled with the fact that Ragnar is as slippery as an eel, we\u0027ll have to temporarily let him off.\"\n\n\n\"Temporary let him off? You would allow despicable people like him to roam our lands? Uncle Bartolomeus, since when did we allow bandits to do as they please? And didn\u0027t that warmongering \u0027sole\u0027 king not send an entire garrison here? I think it\u0027s about time they do something more useful than paroling around a bit, drinking and filling their bellies!\"\n\n\n\"Listen closely Iselda, I care about the people as much as you and your father do. Do you really think it, doesn\u0027t anger me to have such scum roam free? Besides, you should know better than anyone, how difficult it is to get anything done from the garrison. Although we, the great nobles are the ruling council, we don\u0027t have any authority over them. They\u0027re here to defend against any invading force.... and keep an eye on us. So watch that sharp tongue of yours! If your words travel out of this hall, we\u0027ll all be in serious trouble!\"\n\n\n\"Hum, Bartolomeus and Iselda, perhaps it\u0027s time to conclude our... discussion,\" says the last person in the hall, who kept quiet during the whole discussion. He\u0027s a man in his forties. He\u0027s completely bald and has a hawk-nose. Dressed in luxurious black clothing and with his pale skin, he looks a bit like a reaper. \"We\u0027ll follow Bartolomeus suggestion. For the good of the kingdom of Valinor and its people. Now miss Iselda, you can go out and... play.\"\n\n\n\"For the good of the kingdom of Valinor and its people?\" bawls Iselda, as she contemptuously repeats him. \"Since when have you ever cared about \u0027Valinor\u0027 and \u0027its people\u0027, Sarokar?\"\n\n\n\"Do I really need to justify myself against a mere child? A child that can\u0027t hope to even comprehend the complicated situation this kingdom is in, let alone contribute meaningfully? Do I have to remind you, that the only reason this kingdom still stands was by bowing to the almighty Lorimur and its \u0027warmongering\u0027 king? They conquered a third of the entire continent for heaven\u0027s sake, either you yield or you break!\"\n\n\nJust as the discussion is beginning to further escalate, a lackey knocks on the door. After gaining permission to enter, he quickly rushes to Bartolomeus and bows. He looks out of breath as if he ran here as fast as his legs could carry him. \"Important news, my lord! A group of knights from Lorimur have arrived, they call themselves the knights of the Golden Sun!\"\n\n\n\"Speaking of the devil...\" mumbles Iselda.\n\n\nBartolomeus casts a glance in her direction as a warning and then begins to question the servant. \"Yes, and what\u0027s so urgent about it? Tell them they can rest in the barracks, we\u0027ll meet them later.\" Although knights are nobles too, they have a much lower rank than the nobles present here. Even if they\u0027re from the great Lorimur, they\u0027re not that important.\n\n\nThe servant nervously gazes at the gathered nobles. \"My lord, you don\u0027t understand... there\u0027s something odd about them.

He\u0027s a bit at a loss whether he should kiss it or not, so he settles on an awkward bow. You guess that will do. Then you order your soldiers to help the man. They carefully gather anything that\u0027s not broken and together they push the wagon back up. Most of his stuff gets divided over the other wagons, in order not to repeat the accident. A moment later, you\u0027re ready to go. But judging from Bomboulos dismayed expression, he\u0027s disagreeing with your decision.

So it\u0027s your father\u0027s property in a certain way, but he isn\u0027t here. Here nobody tells you what you should or shouldn\u0027t do. Okay, they do, but you can completely ignore it and pretend they didn\u0027t say anything. It\u0027s a new kind of freedom, and frankly said, you begin to like the taste of it.\n\n\nSo life is good and well, but also a tad bit boring. Perhaps the time has come to do what knights usually do? Whatever that may be... \"Does anybody know what a knight usually does?\"\n\n\n\"Uh... eating and killing bandits of course!\" says Bomboulos. He isn\u0027t completely wrong, but you\u0027re pretty sure that \u0027eating\u0027 isn\u0027t something exclusively for knights. And besides, after that \u0027Ragnar problem\u0027, you have had it with bandits for now. Speaking of eating, his new squire Haleth has gained considerable weight since you rescued him. He\u0027s following Bomboulos around lately while wearing golden slippers as well. Sometimes you\u0027re afraid you have created a \u0027Bomboulos junior\u0027.

That sounds like a real pain. You should know better than anybody that we normally don\u0027t associate ourselves with other inferior...I mean common knights.\"\n\n\nIndeed he\u0027s right, all the other knights left Valinor when they saw that you and your order got the respect that you rightfully deserved. And those who were whining about \u0027unfair\u0027 and \u0027unequal treatment\u0027 got thrown out by your guards, who were deeply offended by these false accusations. So at the moment, the Golden Sun is the only knight order present in the entirety of Valinor. Well, it\u0027s not that big in the first place, it\u0027s already too small for just the six of you!\n\n\nBut a tourney, although it might sound a bit cliché, it might increase your fame substantially.

The Silent watchers claimed the disease was brought in with a merchant ship, that managed to break through their blockade. Then the first step is to find out which people came in contact with this ship. After some investigating, it seems the merchant ship in question and the ship that was burned to ash recently, are one and the same. Which immediately raises the second question, how did the disease enter Valinor then?\n\n\nIt turns out a group of transporters, responsible for loading and unloading goods, went aboard. You\u0027re led to one the laborers, he\u0027s staring at the ceiling. With some difficulty, you can reconstruct what has happened from his ravings. According to his story, they didn\u0027t touch anything aboard the ship and their supervisor suddenly ordered them to set it on fire and they were ordered to claim it was an accident. Only their supervisor had inspected the deck and perhaps he had touched anything. Because the next morning they all got sick. So it seems you have finally reached the crux of the matter, their supervisor should be patient zero. But one of the caretakers rejects that theory. \"Mister Ted? No my lady, this poor man is barely at his senses and must be mistaken. Mister Ted is still healthy and has even holed himself up inside his room, out of fear for the plague.\"\n\n\nThat\u0027s rather odd... the person most likely to be infected is still fine, while all the others are sick? This whole mess is getting quite confusing, it\u0027s time to get to the bottom of this. So you completely ignore the Beholder\u0027s objections and head towards Ted\u0027s house. Once you arrive before his doorstep, you order a few soldiers to go fetch this Ted. A few minutes later they appear again, with an old man at spear length. It\u0027s always smart to keep your distance, but it seems the caretaker was right. He doesn\u0027t look sick at all.\n\n\n\"Please, I beg you, my lady, stay away!\" pleads the old man. At first, you assume he\u0027s trying to protect himself, but it turns out he means the exact opposite. \"I-I... might be infected, I don\u0027t wish to endanger anybody!\"\n\n\n\"A funny statement for the sole healthy person amidst the sick,\" scoffs Fariera.\n\n\n\"W-What do you mean? I-I didn\u0027t touch anyone...,\" mutters Ted. Why does he keep thinking, that he infected them? So you decide to ask and you get quite a surprising answer. \"That\u0027s impossible... The plague was on that ship, the crew had succumbed to it. I-I... got bit by one of the rats feeding on the corpse of a sailor. But you must believe me! I immediately rushed home, told the rest they should enjoy themselves at the bar and barricaded myself inside! I know I... should have reported it but I was afraid that... that...\"\n\n\nSo let\u0027s get the facts straight. The plague was on the ship, that\u0027s confirmed. But the person who got bitten by a plague rat is doing \u0027totally fine\u0027 and making sure he doesn\u0027t infect anybody else. While the rest of the laborers all got sick after an evening of boozing and eating. Either the world has gone completely crazy, or there something seriously wrong with this.\n\n\n\"Ahem my lady, it seems I need to go and take a look at the northern village.

I want every entrance, every door, every single window to be closed off. Not a single mice may leave or enter without my explicit permission!\"\n\n\n\"As you command my lady! Please rest assured, everything will be fine,\" says The Beholder, while he makes a bow. Of course, you\u0027re reassured when you entrust the execution of your orders to the most experienced, competent and loyal person present. But why does this bloke seem to assume you were talking to him?\n\n\nLuckily the intended person quickly resolves the silly misunderstanding. \"Then I\u0027ll be counting on you, you can help with looking after the sick,\" says the captain of your personal guard, while he begins to organize his subordinates. Others would always weasel themselves out of their responsibilities, misinterpret your orders, or are just plain incompetent. But you can always count on Dovar, especially when it comes to implementing a draconian quarantine and holding everybody in his iron grip. Relaxed you leave the building.\n\n\n\"W-Wait my lady, I don\u0027t think this is a good idea...,\" stutters the Beholder, while he runs after you. It seems he\u0027s going to complain again, but Dovar orders the soldiers to stop him. It seems he has correctly understood your orders once again, \u0027nobody leaves\u0027 also includes the members of the order of the Silent Watchers. Well since diseases are their so-called specialty, they\u0027ll be more useful here than when they\u0027re just loitering around the castle.\n\n\nAs you leave the quarantine zone, you can already see soldiers boarding up any open windows, fortifying the barricade and sentries armed with crossbows are walking on the rooftops. Large iron chains are installed at the docks preventing any ships from coming or going. In almost no time the entire area is hermetically closed off. Thanks to Lorimur\u0027s strict military order, Valinor will surely be saved. So you can leave everything to the professionals and head back to the castle.\n\n\n--------\n\n\nIt seems you have made the correct decision, a month later the plague is completely gone. Although every single infected patient has died and the population inside the quarantine zone has been more than halved, Valinor has been saved. Of course, those foolish and ungrateful peasants aren\u0027t thankful at all and are busy whining about your harsh and inhumane methods. There\u0027s one odd thing though, there were no casualties amongst your soldiers and the Silent Watchers, you guess they must have been really careful. But since there\u0027s no plague anymore now, they can pack their things and sod off. Their presence only reminds the people what they have been through. And frankly speaking, Dovar could have easily handled it without their help. So after detaining them for a sufficiently long period, to make sure they\u0027re not sick, they are politely requested to leave. Beggars and scarecrows aren\u0027t welcome in your city.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

Your father quickly organizes a reprisal army, in order to crush the rebellion before it\u0027s too late. But the army fails to reconquer Valinor in time and they are ambushed during the siege by Karadas. The army is forced to retreat after suffering grievous losses, it\u0027s a complete defeat. The rebellion of Valinor inspires many other vassal states, that were suppressed by Lorimur. It soon becomes a legend, how the tiny city-state resisted the huge warmongering kingdom and was saved by Karadas. It\u0027s like David and Goliath, the dwarf teaching the giant a lesson. Multiple provinces of Lorimur declare themselves independent and wish to regain their former glory from before they were conquered. Lorimur becomes chaotic and while its armies are busy settling the unrest, all of its vassal states see an opportunity to break free. Karadas promises these former vassal states protection and guarantees that it will make sure the other kingdoms respect their Independence. In exchange for joining into an alliance.\n\n\nWhen the dust finally settles, the once so mighty kingdom of Lorimur, that harbored dreams of ruling the entire continent, has been reduced to only a third of its former size. Your father aged during the past few month more than in two decades. The struggle to keep as much as he could, has completely worn him out. He practically stands with one foot in the grave, but the throne will never be yours. A joke of an heir that\u0027s what you are, one that almost completely doomed the entire kingdom, all because of her absurd pride. Once your father hears about you wildly abusing your authority and twisting his trail to such an extent, he only has a few words for you. \"Disappear from my sight and never, ever come back!\"\n\n\nSince it looks like Lorimur is doomed anyway, it might be for the best. You flee the kingdom and set sail to the Mordurian isles, a place of freedom and opportunity. After your father passes away, one of your cousins ascends the throne, while boot-licking Karadas. It seems the day that Lorimur will become a vassal state is not far off anymore.\n\n\n--------\n\n[POV switch]\n\n\nA few years later, quite a distance away from the Mordurian isles, a large fleet of black ships lies anchored in a deserted bay. A giant skull is painted on the sails. It\u0027s the most dangerous pirate group that has ever sailed the seas. They call themselves, \u0027The pirates of the Dark Sun\u0027. According to them, their glory was covered and their bright future turned dark. Like the moon covers the sun during a solar eclipse. When they fled their former home, a lot of their loyal-until-death soldiers followed them into exile. So once they arrived at the Mordurian isles, the famous pirate nest. They had no problem recruiting pirates to further fill up the empty spots in their ranks. During the past years, they plagued the seas, plundered merchant fleets, pillaged poorly defended port cities and amassed mountains of loot. Although it\u0027s almost unbelievable, these pirates can fight like hardened elite soldiers and are armed to the teeth. So after each consecutive victory, more and more pirates flocked under their banner and so the fleet had expanded. Until it had reached its current size. Now they are going ashore and enter a whole new, completely undiscovered and unknown land.\n\n\nThousands of pirates orderly march on the beach, tents are being set up. A group of core veterans are supervising them during the operation, it looks like they have been instilled with an iron discipline. Because the pirates behave more like an army, than most real armies would. Then a large stage is erected and slowly a mysterious woman ascends it, her presence alone is enough to silence all the pirates. \"Today a new chapter in my life will begin. I have decided to put the past behind me and move onwards to the future. I know some of you may have your doubts, about coming to these unknown and foreign lands, so terribly far away from home. But here a new future awaits us. From the information that I have gathered, these lands are far bigger than you would ever imagine and multiple savage tribes live here.\"\n\n\nThis causes some unrest among the pirates, but they maintain their ranks and keep silent. The woman beckons to a fat pirate, that\u0027s standing at the side. He steps forward and multiple prisoners in rags are dragged forward and forced to kneel. \"They\u0027re here, boss!\"\n\n\nWith a cold smile the woman resumes her speech. \"These are the natives of those savage tribes. I know everybody here probably has some questions, about their habits, their culture, are they hostile? But none of that matters. There\u0027s only one question that\u0027s important and if the answer is yes, all other questions become irrelevant. Whose the strongest? They, or us? They\u0027re armed with wooden clubs, they never have even heard of armor, they possess no crossbows, no siege equipment, no understanding of tactics and formations. These tribes are nothing more than large villages. So I believe everybody can guess the answer now.\"\n\n\n\"...And they have gold! Lot\u0027s of it too!\" laughs the fat pirate while he rubs his hands together.\n\n\n\"Ha ha, my mistake, that\u0027s also an important question. Besides these natives have no king or queen yet, so I have decided to help them out and fill up this position. Don\u0027t you all agree?\" asks the woman to the prisoners, her unusual appearance almost makes her look like a goddess in their eyes. And they quickly begin to grovel, as much as their chains allow them to.\n\n\n\"Wonderful! Follow me, burn the ships behind us and let\u0027s go conquer these lands!\"\n\n\nThen all the pirates release a loud cheer and begin to hammer on their shields with their weapons. Gold, slaughter and conquest are like music to their ears. \"Long live Queen Elsia! Eternal glory to the pirates of the Dark Sun!\"\n\n\n\"Now then, my kingdom awaits!\" laughs the woman with a murderous glare in her eyes.\n\n\nThe end...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.

A bit later you reach the dock area where the plague has been momentarily contained. It seems the word about the plague has already gone around and the streets in this area of the city are completely deserted.

Now the time has come for him to prove himself and your investment to pay off. So one of your guards runs toward the laboratory, in order to fetch the alchemist.\n\n\n\"Who\u0027s this Fozir, if I may ask?\" says the Beholder.\n\n\n\"Bah a useless alchemist who can\u0027t make any gold,\" explains Bomboulos. \"Wasted his time writing complicated medical books.\"\n\n\n\"Your High...

Well, you learned something today, never get treatment at the Zannar manor.\n\n\nOrlag gives Bomboulos a weird glance, seemingly unsure whether that was just an inappropriate joke or he was bloody serious. \"Anyway, the point is that we can\u0027t just let any nobody deal with a plague, that will only cause it to spread even further.

Then I\u0027ll search in the medical records for diseases with similar symptoms, and attempt to find a cure by mixing various medical herbs and testing it on the infected patients. Although this might sound heartless, these kinds of experiments will drastically increase the chance of finding a cure.\"\n\n\nThen Fozir slowly walks towards you, under the stupefied gazes of the others, and bows before you. \"I\u0027m here my lady, at your service. But first I must warn you, I\u0027m afraid that we stand little to no chance of stopping this plague. From the symptoms I heard so far, this seems to be a strain of the \u0027Septicemic plague\u0027 or better known as the \u0027Black Death\u0027. Humans are not the primary vector responsible for spreading it, fleas and rodents are the main cause. So quarantining or killing the infected patients won\u0027t be effective in stopping the plague. It pains me to admit it, but we simply lack the means to control the rodent population, so the plague will keep resurfacing. Although I\u0027ll do my utmost to find a cure, I\u0027m afraid there will soon be too many patients for me to handle.\"\n\n\nBomboulos and Tyrwill just stare at Fozir blankly, his monologue got a bit too complicated for them. They\u0027re quite lucky because his prediction gives you the chills. Doesn\u0027t that mean that we\u0027re all doomed? It\u0027s scarier when somebody calmly explains why we\u0027re all doomed than having one crazy clown screaming it.

Further down the street stands a red-robed man on a stage and he\u0027s fervently preaching to the listening crowd. It\u0027s those shams of the Eternal Light again. \"People of Valinor!

Everybody is sighing and stretching from the long and tiring journey. Then suddenly a beautiful young woman and a stocky middle-aged man arrive. Well the woman runs and the man follows behind her at a snail\u0027s pace, so they don\u0027t arrive at the exact same moment. The woman immediately begins yelling and it seems to be directed at you. \"You there! Or should I say, \u0027O great knight, a moment of your time?\u0027 Hm? What do you think you\u0027re doing? Cruelly beating people for no reason at all!\"\n\n\n\"Is that the local princess? Pff, pretty face but no class,\" laughs Tyrwill.\n\n\n\"She\u0027s lady Iselda, the daughter of the grand-duke. Valinor has no royalty and is ruled by the council of the nobles,\" corrects Orlag her. Curious in fact, for a place as small as this, one grand-duke should do. Why need three?\n\n\n\"Commander! These knights have crossed the line! I demand they receive their just punishment and reimburse the citizens for their loathsome behavior!\" screams Iselda to the man behind her. Then she turns towards you. \"Proud of yourself? People like you don\u0027t even deserve to be a knight! Do you think the vows you have sworn were just some pleasantries!\"\n\n\nThe man finally reaches your group, with an annoyed expression on his face. He\u0027s already beginning to lose his hair, at the front of his head. He has a long mustache and a small pot-nose. Altogether he doesn\u0027t make the most threatening impression. The crest of Lorimur is visible on his armor, it seems he\u0027s the garrison commander your father told you about. \"Hmm, it seems lady Iselda is right this time. This kind of behavior is unacceptable for a knight of the kingdom. You\u0027ll receive detention for two weeks, stripped from your title and your actions will be reported. Name?\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re talking to her excellency, Lady Elsia!\" yells Dovar while he approaches the commander.\n\n\n\"Eh? I was talking to her, not to you!\" snarls the commander. Your father gave you a letter, which would explain the situation to the commander. But it had one tiny mistake in it. According to the letter, you would just be a common knight and would have been placed under his command. Since that\u0027s an unacceptable flaw you ended up \u0027accidentally\u0027 tossing it into the campfire. Since the real letter has gone missing, one of your subordinates will have to abuse his authority a bit. Secretly, you nod towards the captain of your personal guard.\n\n\nDovar quickly hands a few official documents to the garrison commander. He looks through it and becomes paler with the second. \"What?? You\u0027ve been appointed by the crown-princess of Lorimur herself!\" Indeed, your subordinates are quite impressive. Profusely sweating the commander begins bowing, \"My lady, my humble apologies! I wasn\u0027t aware you had such connections in high places. Welcome, welcome in the city-state of Valinor! I hope it\u0027s to your liking. If there\u0027s anything I can do, please, by all means, don\u0027t hold back and tell me. I\u0027m commander Morvir, at your service!\" And so the conflict has been solved.\n\n\n\"Wait a second! What about their punishment? Commander, this is against all rules! You can\u0027t just tolerate this!\" yells Iselda, while she casts a betrayed look at the commander. Doesn\u0027t she realize that if he tries to follow the rules, he will involve himself into a conflict between the king and the crown princess?

And the next day, you finally arrive at your destination. It\u0027s already noon, a warm breeze softly blows by and you can feel the warmth of the sunlight on your skin.\n\n\nBefore you, the city of Valinor stretches out. At first glance, it looks like an average trading city, just like there are over a dozen in Lorimur. Rows and rows of wooden houses, surrounded by a large stone wall. There are two main entrances, the southern one that\u0027s in front of you and the eastern one. Travelers, farmers, and merchants are entering the city or leaving it, while their goods are checked by the city guards. On the west side of the city flows the Valis, a large river bringing merchants and goods with it. It seems to be reasonably busy, with small trading ships entering the port. Next to the port, further upstream, a large castle rises up. It seems to be placed there to defend the city and watch the river. Together with the surrounding territory, consisting out of fields and a few villages, it\u0027s the city-state of Valinor.\n\n\n\"Pff, this is just an everyday city! And they dare call it a nation? Boss Elsia, we\u0027ll be able to throw our weight around here!\" laughs Bomboulos, as he scornfully looks at the city. Indeed compared to the capital of Lorimur, this is indeed a bit...lacking. And as far as you can see the rest of your friends share that opinion.\n\n\nEven if it doesn\u0027t look very impressive, it\u0027s a chance to prove yourself. Or follow Bomboulos suggestion and enjoy yourself. \"It doesn\u0027t matter, follow me!\"\n\n\nOnce you arrive at the gate, all eyes are directed at you. It must be your overflowing charisma at work, the hundreds of soldiers following behind you are nothing but a small distraction. Immediately one of the servants rides to the front, pulls out a parchment and begins his announcement. \"Hear ye, hear ye! You are being graced by the presence of the glorious knight\u0027s of the Golden Sun! With its illustrious members: The graceful Lady Tyrwill, the mysterious Lord Hallas, the magnificent Lord Bomboulos and the beautiful Lady Fariera. But above all, led by one of the greatest knights of our age, Lady Elsia!

So they\u0027re idly staring at your group for a few seconds. Perhaps there are even a few uneducated ingrates amongst them, who haven\u0027t yet heard of your illustrious order. Luckily when the soldiers behind you begin to make some threatening gestures, they all begin to scurry out of the way. How polite of them.\n\n\nBut like usual, there is always one of them clumsy enough to mess up, even the simplest of tasks. The wagon at the front, that was being checked by the guards, has been turned over by the panicked horses. Now it blocks the entrance and the peasant that\u0027s responsible, seems to be more concerned about his measly cart, than clearing the way! Impatient you direct your horse towards him, while the rest of the order follows behind you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: People know you, yet all too often you\u0027re seen as just \u0027an important somebody\u0027.

Or at least that\u0027s what their job is supposed to be, they look ready to run for the hills at the first sight of danger.\n\n\nWhen you arrive near the barricade, you suddenly see a few citizens climb over it. Two men, an old grandpa, three women, and a little kid. The sentries do a poor job at stopping them, they only point their spears at them and yell that they aren\u0027t allowed to leave. But none of them seems to be eager to approach the refugees too closely,  out of fear that they might get infected. One of the refugees pretends to sneeze in the direction of a nearby sentry and the man almost drops his spear in his hurry to jump away.\n\n\nAnnoyed the Beholder raises his hand and signals his subordinates who immediately raise their bows. \"Are these pathetic weasels, supposed to contain the plague?

By the way, that Fozir fellow got a laboratory somewhere in the castle and immediately dove on his research. Well, he\u0027s trying to be useful. \"You see Lady Elsia, the nearby villages have been plagued by the infamous bandit Ragnar,\" says Bartolomeus.\n\n\n\"Infamous? Never heard of him,\" says Hallas, while he\u0027s poking his nose.\n\n\n\"If even Hallas doesn\u0027t know the guy he must be some nobody,\" scoffs Fariera.\n\n\n\"How many men does he have?\" says Bomboulos, while he temporarily stops eating. Yes, everybody is done eating, but he\u0027s the exception.\n\n\n\"...Uhm...We don\u0027t know exactly...enough to be a serious threat to the villages, that\u0027s all we know,\" says Bartolomeus.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t mean to belittle your problems, my lord. But even a dozen armed men can be a threat to small villages with less than a hundred peasants,\" points Orlag out. Indeed from your lessons in strategic warfare, you can still vaguely remember that Orlag is probably right. It would be stupid to only look at the raw numbers. A small village has a lot of people, who aren\u0027t suited to combat like the children, the sick and the elderly. The number of able-bodied fighters they can muster is only about 20-40% of the whole population. They also lack experience in combat and have very poor morale. Coupled with the fact most peasants have no other weapons than tools like a pitchfork, knives or an axe. So bandits slaughtering whole villages, although they\u0027re outnumbered, is not that unusual.\n\n\nBut those same bandits would be no match for a trained, well-equipped and disciplined army. Every single one of the soldiers of your personal guard can easily handle 10 of those third-rate warriors. Even if the quality of the troops here is a bit lower, they should still be easily victoriously when the size of the forces is evenly matched. It\u0027s kind of hard to believe the city can\u0027t spare a fifty or a hundred soldiers to clean this mess up. In fact, doesn\u0027t the garrison of Lorimur, to keep the situation under control, not have around 2000 soldiers stationed here? Even if they\u0027re not the sharpest blades in the sheath, cleaning up some measly bandits shouldn\u0027t be too hard, right?\n\n\n\"Not all of us can mobilize a large force whenever we feel like it,\" interjects Sarokar. \"Besides Ragnar is as cunning as a fox, he strikes lightning quick and then disappears back into the forest, like a ghost. When our men arrive, those vermin are gone with the wind. Then they strike again, somewhere else and the cycle repeats.\"\n\n\n\"Indeed it\u0027s just as Sarokar says, all of our attempts to catch him have failed. We once... requested aid from the garrison commander, but he claims he has to defend the city against possible invaders and cannot afford to \u0027spread out\u0027 his troops too much. Iselda requested we gather enough troops and comb throughout the entire forest until he\u0027s found, but we don\u0027t have that kind of manpower. We cannot conscript any farmers, taking them away from their fields in this season will have disastrous consequences for the harvest. A famine would cost a lot more lives than ten Ragnar\u0027s together.\"\n\n\n\"And he knows, that\u0027s why he\u0027s so arrogant...\" adds Sarokar. It seems the local officials are quite useless.

Then you see three people approaching you. They must be the local nobility or something of the sort. The old man at the front makes a polite greeting. \"Welcome knights of the Golden Sun! Welcome to Valinor! I\u0027m Bartolomeus Dorendall, one of the three dukes of the noble council. These two are lord Sarokar Kevir, also a duke, and this is lady Iselda Esendal, substituting for her father. Pardon me for my ignorance, I have never heard of you before.

Is he implying that it\u0027s unusual for a knight to have a few hundred bodyguards? If that\u0027s true, the knight profession must be quite risky under normal circumstances. \"Then why exactly did you decide to come here?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re knights on a quest to bring order and peace to these troubled lands!\" do you say.

Not to say you\u0027re a good-for-nothing, but using brute and uncivilized force just isn\u0027t your specialty. Besides you\u0027re distracted while looking for other excuses... If you gave it your all, you\u0027d probably, no definitely win.\n\n\nIf there is something like a \"next time\", perhaps a bit more effort is required.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares. (-4045)\nPopularity: You\u0027re a tyrant that has given a new meaning to the word \u0027fear\u0027. Does anybody still need to spell out how much everybody hates you?

I relied on you, I always believed in you!... I trusted you.\" The fake tears streaming over your face make your act all the more believable. It\u0027s a neat little trick you learned from that vixen, Fariera\n\n\n\"I-I had no choice... I made my decision long ago,\" stutters Orlag, while he lowers his sword. Well, stupidity seems to be a shared trait in your knight order, that he would fall for a simple trick like that. You secretly signal the nearby guard and when Orlag is not paying proper attention to him, he lunges forward and pierces Orlag with his sword.\n\n\n\"Farewell loser!\" As corpse hits the floor, his expression is twisted in agony.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFame: Nobody knows you and probably nobody cares.
