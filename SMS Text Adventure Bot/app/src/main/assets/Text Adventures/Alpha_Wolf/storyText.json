  "page 123": "“So I see you’ve hooked up with Glenn, how’s that working out?” you ask.\n“Oh its great…” she says. Her demeanor didn’t change.\n“So is Glenn treating you any better?” you ask\n“Well…uh…yeah! Yes he is…”\n“That didn’t sound very convincing Nancy.”\n“Okay, so he’s a dickhead too, but at least with him he goes home and I don’t have to slave over him on a regular basis.”\n“Oh no, you just get treated like a cum bucket whenever he wants some pussy.”\n“EXCUSE ME?!”\n“Hey look, I’m just tellin’ it like it is. From what I can tell he isn’t exactly Mr. Right. Sheesh don’t you know the guy’s past? He’s fucking crazy.”\n“Yeah, but I can change him…”\n”This again? Look honey, your track record isn’t good as far as that goes. Besides you can’t change the insane.”\n”(Sob!) I know! Why the hell do I keep doing this to myself! (Sob!)”\n\nOh shit, you just got yourself into some drama you didn’t want to; you try to change the subject back to Kong.\n\n“Look, obviously Kong can’t be as bad as Colossal Asshole.”\n“(Sniff) Oh no? He doesn’t do shit around the house and this is MY house! MY money paid for everything in here! If it wasn’t for me picking him up all those years ago he wouldn’t have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out! Fuck him! I’m sick of him taking me for granted. I just jumped from one abusive marriage to another!”\n“Erm…Kong doesn’t beat you does he? Because if that’s the case then…”\n“Oh no, he’s never done that. If that ever had happened, I would’ve kicked him out a long time ago.”\n“Well, maybe I was wrong and you did change him a little then. I mean if you knew Kong back in the day, he had real temper problems. It seems like you did have some effect on him.”\n“Maybe…”\n“Look how about I go back and talk to…”\n\nSuddenly the doorbell rings.\n\n“Hold on Wolf let me get that.”\n\nWhile you wait for Nancy to come back, you think you’re on the right track to convincing her to take back Kong. Then she arrives in the kitchen with some big ass roses and happily reading a card.\n\n“Where the hell did you get those things? Hey are those from Kong?” you say hopefully.\n“No.”\n“They aren’t from Glenn are they?” you ask a little more worried.\n“Pfft, yeah right.”\n“So who are they from?”\n“Oh they’re from Ymir, he probably had Joe specially grow them for me…he’s so sweet and sensitive.”\n”You’re fucking Ymir too?!” you exclaim.\n“No, he just leaves me presents with cards on my doorstep. He’s so shy, I wish he wasn’t though, because I wouldn’t mind seeing him. He writes the most romantic things…”\n\nNancy begins to day dream about Ymir and now you’re back at square one again. Still, you do wonder if she shouldn’t be with Ymir. Nancy does seem like a nice girl and she probably deserves better than Kong, and certainly deserves better than Glenn.\n",
  "page 122": "The Sensitive Ape: Mighty Joe Young\n\nAfter Kong destroyed his own career, some of the humans that exploited him still wanted to go with the giant monkey theme so they had to find a substitute. Someone suggested Kong’s cousin Joe. He seemed like the perfect candidate, maybe he wasn’t as big as Kong, but he was certainly a lot more manageable and calm. He’d do, they were sure of it.\n\nThis plan was doomed from the start. First of all Joe wasn’t really interested in acting, he’d rather just live his life in the wilderness. This wasn’t too much of a problem, after all they’d convinced Kong to “embrace” civilization, they could do it with Joe. However, it was apparent that Joe didn’t really want to play a brute similar to Kong. He felt he should be portrayed as a more sensitive being. As a compromise the humans told him that the movie would be made in such a way that the audience would feel sympathy like they did with Kong, but Joe wasn’t buying it. Rewrites and recasts plagued the productions. Joe was also a lot smarter than Kong, they couldn’t exploit him like they could with Kong, he over looked everything they ever tried to make him sign and if he didn’t like it then he’d tell them as much.\n\nThe third thing was it was apparent that Joe was erm…a bit light on his feet and it was coming through on the screen. They quite correctly though the public wouldn’t accept this, so they tried to “toughen” up his image by putting the word “Mighty” in front of his name. It didn’t really help since Joe made no effort to hide who he was in public and didn’t really understand why he should. Though nobody was going to say anything, since he was still an incredibly strong 12ft ape, the public wasn’t ready for a “sensitive” monkey. His movies bombed, but he didn’t mind, he made his money and invested it well. The joke was on the humans that tried to take advantage of him.\n\nLast you heard he bought himself a nice home and spends most of time in his private garden tending to his exotic flowers which he grows for his own florist business.\n",
  "page 125": "The Amazing Colossal Man: Glenn Manning\n\nGlenn was just another normal human who got “monsterized” through technology. A common theme during the 1950s. In this case it was a good old nuclear explosion and radiation that steadily caused him to grow into a giant.\n\nGiven that he was soldier, the army was hoping to use him as some kind of weapon, but that was quickly dismissed due to his growing mental instability. Glenn, hadn’t been known to be stable anyway, he’d come close to a Section 8 a couple times before becoming a giant. It was only due to his coming from a proud military family that he’d avoided such a dismissal. Now that he was a 50ft freak, he just went crazier than a shithouse rat sitting in the hot sun. He wreaked havoc and again, it was only because of his influential family that he wasn’t killed and merely captured and heavily drugged instead.\n\nHe was ultimately institutionalized and kept heavily doped up for a majority of his life, and let out for periods of time. A few agents wanted to use him in a series of movies, but most attempts were failures. He was either too doped up to act properly, or not doped up enough to act civilized.\n\nIn his later years he became a little more subdued and was released permanently, but still had to take medication.\n",
  "page 124": "“Look he says he’s really sorry. Why don’t you just give him a second chance?” you continue to press the issue.\n“I said NO and if he sent you here to convince me then you can go right back and tell him you fuckin’ failed!”\n“Oh so Glenn’s such a better choice huh? I though you were supposed to be a feminist. Usually those types are smart, you’re about as bright as a fucking busted nightlight!”\n“Get the fuck outta my house, you fuckin’ males are all alike! Trying to boss us around and tell us what to do!”\n“Yeah, yeah fine I’m outta here, enjoy bein’ Glenn’s fuck toy. I swear you bitches never know what the fuck you want…”\n\nThat last remark gets you a hard slap from Nancy. You go flying from the table and through the window and continue flying until you hit a tree. You then fall to the ground in a heap. You attempt to stand back up, but you’re very woozy. You see Kong sitting nearby watching you try to regain your balance. She must’ve knocked you back to where you started!\n\n“Well let me guess, she’s not taking me back.” He says\n“Got it in one Kong.” You say and then fall unconscious.\n",
  "page 127": "Here’s your good deed for…well you can’t remember the last time you did one, but you’re doing one now.\n\n“Nancy, you want me to find Ymir and talk to him?”\n“You’d do that? Why yes! But how are you going to find him?”\n“Please, I got an excellent sense of smell. I could find him if he was 20 miles from this house.”\n“Well okay then, tell him I’m interested and he needn’t be shy.”\n\nNancy puts you down on the floor and opens the door for you. You know where the hell he’s at, Venusian isn’t a common smell on this planet and you aren’t going to have to go too far to find him. You walk around the corner of the house and see him hiding in the overgrown bushes looking into one of the windows. Big enough to hide him from Nancy, but not you since you can walk right in the things.\n\n“So Ymir, are you actually ever going to talk to Nancy, or are you going to stalk her forever?”\n“Argh! Wolf! I thought you were in the house! Um…did she get my roses?” Ymir asks surprised.\n“Yeah she got them and she likes them, so why don’t you just talk to her already?”\n“I dunno, she’s taller than me and…”\n“Don’t mean shit! I went out with Mary and she was taller than me, and that wasn’t even including that ridiculous beehive hairstyle she had! Look I know for a fact she likes you, she told me to tell you as much. Now I was originally here to hook her back up with Kong…so are you gonna let me do that? Or are you gonna fuckin’ man up and go talk to the girl, because she’s got that Colossal asshole coming by later too.”\n“Well, I guess I’ll try.”\n“Dammit! Don’t try! Do! There is no try! You gotta go in there with all the confidence that you say in your love poems or whatever the hell you’ve been writing to her. Obviously you’ve got the words, now just say the shit to her in person.”\n\nYmir puffs up with pride.\n\n“I’ll do it!”\n“That’s the spirit. Now go in there and get your woman.”\n“Hey wait, you think I’ll be big enough to um…”\n”What? To fuck her? Shit I dunno, just lick her pussy a lot, she’ll be happy trust me.”\n\nAs you leave Ymir knocks on the door and Nancy opens it and gives him a big hug immediately. Looks like your work is done here. You drive back home.\n\nYou get back and walk to where Kong is. He’s sleeping again.\n\n“Hey Kong wake up!”\n“Hmm? Yeah, I’m up. So did you do it?”\n“Nope, sorry. Couldn’t convince her.”\n“Ah well it was a long shot. Guess we’re neighbors.”\n“Guess so, see ya.”\n\nKong rolls over back to sleep and you go back to your cabin. A few days pass and just as you thought, a new “aroma” invades the area. You’re happy to take the damn comic convention job just to get away from the stink.\n\nJust goes to show what you’ve always known:\n\n“No good deed goes unpunished.”\n",
  "page 129": "The Beast From Space: Ymir\n\nYou don’t know too much about Ymir, all you mainly know is he’s originally from Venus. He never really fit in with the rest of the monsters mainly due to his height, he wasn’t small enough to hang out with the likes of you and Fagula, but he wasn’t big enough to hang out with the giants like Kong.\n\nIt was because of this, he tried a little harder to prove he could be just as destructive as the bigger giants in movies, but as far as his private life was concerned he didn’t cause any mayhem at all.\n\nMost directors loved working with him.\n",
  "page 128": "Nope you were here to help Kong and that’s what you’re going to do, for good or bad.\n\n“See? See what I’m saying Nancy? You’re doing it again! You’re falling for the romantic bit. Ymir’s just saying all that shit to get on your good side.”\n“You think so?”\n“Hell yeah! A lot of guys do it; you should know that by now! Look, I’ve used the same damn routine on several occasions until I just got too fucking lazy and decided it was too much trouble!”\n“I suppose you’re right, but why would he be too shy to show up? Surely it can’t all be an act.”\n“Hey, guy can do anything to get the pussy. Of course maybe it isn’t an act, and he’s just a creepy stalker type. You ever think of that? Maybe hiding and secretly spying on you! He is smaller than you, you know.”\n\nNancy looks a bit worried by that revelation.\n\n“Eek! I never even thought of that!”\n”See? That’s why you shouldn’t even consider getting with Ymir and should go back with Kong, at least you know where you stand with him.”\n“Maybe…but what about Glenn?”\n“What?! Hell no! You don’t want him, he’s a fucking nutball! Maybe Kong’s not the most sensitive, but at least you can reason with him. He can’t be all bad; you have stayed married all these years.”\n“I guess you’re right. Maybe I overreacted…okay you can tell Kong he can come back, but he’s going to have to stop saying some of the shit he says to me!”\n“I’ll tell him.”\n\nNancy puts you back on the floor and opens the door for you to leave. You get back on your bike and ride back home to where Kong is munching on some leaves in a bored fashion.\n\n“Hey Kong…what the fuck man? You eat every leaf in the fucking forest?”\n“Just the ones in the immediate area…what? I was hungry!”\n”Well, you can get yourself a home cooked meal now, Nancy’s willing to take you back, BUT you need to at least act a little less like an asshole. Tell her you love her and all that shit every now and then.”\n“Aw man…”\n”Jesus fuckin’ Christ Kong it ain’t that hard! Hell she’s doing everything for your broke ass. I wish I was that fuckin’ lucky! You oughta be a little bit appreciative! She’s got other giants after her already.”\n“What?! Oh shit! I guess I better watch myself.”\n“Guess you better, okay then off you go.”\n“Hey thanks Wolf, I won’t forget this, when Nancy gives me my weekly allowance I’ll make sure to have a check sent to you.”\n\nHe takes his leave and you head back home, not really expecting anything from Kong, a few days later when you’re dreading having to take that comic convention job, you get a check in the mail, its from Kong just like he promised.\n\nHooray, you can avoid being a guest speaker for a bunch of nerds for at least another year!\n",
  "page 79": "You shake your head and go back to Moreau’s house. Moreau is fiddling with some large old looking radio that contains a small black and white screen in it.\n\n“This is not going to work.” You tell him.\n“You’re giving up already?!”\n“Well I don’t know what to do, maybe if I had more time I could do something, but shit Moreau, you bred all the damn fight out of them.”\n\nJust then a voice comes on the radio and an image appears on the screen, it looks like some deepsea diver…oh geez it’s Ro-Man. The bureaucratic joke of the galaxy. Its fitting that he should be working for a bunch of idiotic Martians.\n\n“Dr. Moreau, the Martian colonist will be here soon! I hope you have made your evacuations of your island, or we shall WIPE you from it!” Ro-man says mechanically.\n“Ro-Man, please can’t we talk about this? I mean we’re peaceful, we won’t cause you any trouble!” Moreau says into his microphone.\n“No! My orders are clear! We will WIPE you from the island!”\n\nYou snatch the mic from Moreau and address Ro-Man.\n\n“Hey Ro-Man, you must be really scraping the bottom of the barrel if you’re working for Martians now. What happened, all the other aliens realize what a fucking joke you are?”\n“What!? Wolf?! What’re you doing there? We’re about to WIPE the island clean of all Earthlings and that includes you if you insist on staying there!” Ro-Man retorts.\n“I know Martians were stupid, but fuck, didn’t they realize what a goddamn joke you were when YOU attempted to take over the Earth?”\n“Shut up Wolf! Hey isn’t that island full of a bunch of pacifists? What’s a self-proclaimed badass Alpha Wolf doing there? You turn pussy too or are YOU scraping the bottom of the barrel by working for them?”\n“Fuck off Ro-Man! I got an idea, how about we settle this hand to hand combat? If I win you all go home, and if you win…well you won’t win, because you’re fucking moron.”\n“I don’t think so; we’re intent on colonizing this island in accordance with the new Earth-Mars cooperation treaty. Your pitiful attempts to stall for time are useless.”\n“Who says I’m stalling for time? I’m just saying I could kick your ass! You think I give a shit about this island? I’m just here to see if I got one more fight left in me, I was hoping for more of a challenge, but you’ll have to do. Of course if you’re too scared…”\n”Aaargh! Alright! I’ll play your little game you mangy Earth mammal! We’ll do battle when we arrive and I’ll take great pleasure in crushing your skull!”\n\nRo-man breaks communication, and Moreau is more than a little disturbed by your recent conversation.\n\n“Wolf! You promised to help us! I knew you were a lot of things, but I thought you at least weren’t a liar!”\n“Calm the hell down Moreau! Despite what Ro-Man thinks, I have bough you guys some time. While me and Ro-Man are bashing each others heads in, the Martians will be gathered around watching and probably taking bets. Besides unsuccessful invasions and fucking human women, there’s nothing they like better than watching a fight.”\n“Okay, but what good does that do us? I mean even if you win, the Martians will still kill all of us.”\n“Ah that’s where you and the hippy freak coalition come in. I know you guys are fond of your drugs here, so when the Martians are watching I want you guys to act like hosts and serve drinks laced with LSD or whatever hallucinogenics you keep stashed here. By the time I finish kicking Ro-Man’s ass, the Martians will be tripping so hard you can make quick work of them.”\n“That’s not a bad plan, but I think we’ll dispense with killing them as you’re suggesting. We can just destroy their weapons.”\n“(Sigh) Alright suit yourselves. But unarmed Martians are still hostile, even if they aren’t typically threatening.”\n“If I can make my citizens civilized, I can do the same with Martians, now let’s get prepared. What do I serve them to drink though? Its not like we have whatever it is Martians like to drink here.”\n“Sure you do. You’ve got water. Mars isn’t known for having a lot of it, so they can’t get enough of the stuff. Its one of the reasons why they wanted Earth so damn bad.”\n\nA few days pass and Moreau prepares his citizens for the plan, while they build some risers and bleachers for the fight, meanwhile you get in some last minute training. Ro-Man might be an idiot, but you’ve got a pretty good idea that he’s very strong, you’ll have to be on the top of your game.\n\nYou watch the skies and finally the Martians arrive. They land and all come pouring out of their saucers firing their lasers in the air, and yelling about how they’re going to see a good fight. Ro-Man appears and looks as goofy as he always has. A large crowd gathers and soon it’s just you and Ro-Man in the center.\n\n“This is going to be your biggest mistake since your infamous Plan 9 invasion attempt.” You tell Ro-Man.\n",
  "page 78": "“Aw hell, if the past is any indication Martians ain’t shit. I don’t have anything better to do. Let’s get going.” You remark.\n\nYou and Moreau leave the next day to his island by private plane. When you arrive you can see why the place is considered a paradise, its basically untamed wilderness with some agricultural improvements and basic structures to house the citizens.\n\nSpeaking of citizens, you see them in person. They’re a motley looking bunch. You see boar boys, goat girls, manatee men, and wombat women and those are some of the regular ones. Some look like they’ve been mixed with several species of animals, so you can’t even be sure what the hell they are.\n\nMoreau’s citizens are equally interested in you.\n\n“Are you another citizen?” one of them asks as they all attempt to crowd you.\n“What? Hell no! I’m a fucking werewolf! Not a freak of nature!” you snarl, not wanting them to touch you. Moreau take the opportunity to make sure you don’t kill anyone.\n“This is Wolf. He’s different than you…in several ways. But he’s here to help us with our current problem, just like our aquatic friend who volunteered to help a few days ago.”\n\nYou stop Moreau.\n\n“Aquatic friend? You got someone else to help you?” you ask.\n“Well yes, I wasn’t sure if you’d help, so I tried to get others as well. You and he were the only takers it seems though. I’m pretty sure you and he are familiar with each other. I can’t pronounce his real name, but he goes by Gil.”\n\n“Gil?! You got GIL?! He was almost as reclusive as you! How’d you get him to help?”\n“I don’t know. It was really just a gamble. I made the same deal, but I had little hope of him accepting it since he’s not exactly fond of land dwellers. He accepted though since he’s tired of having humans intrude on his home every five minute. He already has a place set aside for himself on the island. I just hope the island is still ours after all this.”\n“Where is he?”\n“He keeps to himself in a nearby swamp. He likes his privacy and I respect it. You and he can talk later. I’d like you to get to the training. The Martians will be coming soon, I’m predicting in a matter of days.”\n“DAYS!? You didn’t say that before! How am I supposed to train these freaks in days?”\n“Please Wolf you must try! Gil tried and didn’t get very far; he may have even given up. I was hoping you might have more luck since you’re a bit closer to my citizens.”\n“I’m nothing like your citizens…but I’ll see what I can do.”\n",
  "page 71": "You don’t even care about the money or anything at this point, you just need to get off this island and Moreau’s the only one who can fly the plane.\n\n“Alright look, forget the money, just take me home, I just don’t want to be on this island any longer the whole place sickens my sensibilities.”\n\nMoreau looks annoyed by your comment.\n\n“Hmm, well if you hate my Utopia so much, I certainly won’t keep you any longer. I’ll fly you home immediately. I didn’t want your kind really living here anyway. At least Gil is civilized enough to appreciate this place.”\n“Uh actually I’d like to go back to the mainland as well. I don’t care about any money either, I’m not going to be living anywhere that requires rent anyway.” Gil says nervously.\n“What? I thought you wanted to stay?”\n“I changed my mind! Can we just leave?!”\n“Alright fine, I’ll fly you both back. I’ll get the plane ready. I’m a little puzzled by all this, you’ve helped me, but now you don’t want any reward. All I can say is thanks I guess.”\n\nAfter Moreau leaves to start up the plane, you ask Gil what’s up with him.\n\n“So why are you leaving?” you ask.\n“Duh! The same reason you are, because my cousin will destroy this fucking place, even though Moreau seems to be oblivious of that fact. Not to mention he still sounded pissed at me on the phone, so I don’t want to be here when he arrives! (Sigh) And I did so want to live here too.”\n“Well if it wasn’t your cousin, it would’ve been the Martians so you would’ve had to leave anyway. I’m not getting anything out of this either; I gotta go back to my cabin in the woods and figure out how to raise some money again. I hope Erik’s got something lined up.”\n“At least you have a home to return to, I gotta find a new one all over again.”\n“Hm, well there’s a small lake in the woods I live in, you might try that for awhile. Not too many people go into the woods, especially since I tend to discourage it.”\n“I might just do that since I don’t have any better ideas right now, I guess you’re not a bad sort for a land dweller. Sounds like Moreau got the plane working, let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nYou and Gil proceed to talk about a great many of things while on the plane and become quite friendly with each other. Probably a first for the both of you. After Moreau drops you both off, you continue to discuss the old days while Gil checks out the lake you were talking about. He mentions it’s a good place as long as nobody bothers him. Gil becomes your new neighbor and you both part ways since you both still want your solitude. You do get together to watch TV when a news story comes on a couple days after you left Moreau’s island...\n\nThe Martians arrived just like they said, and so did Godzilla. A massive fight broke out, but of course the only winner could ever be Godzilla. Their flying saucers were incinerated by his radioactive breath and their troops were crushed underfoot with ease.\n\nThe entire island was also incinerated and crushed underfoot with ease! Most of Moreau’s citizens were killed in the cross fire of this battle. Dr. Moreau was found dead from a self-inflicted beam blast to the head (A weapon he picked up from a dead Martian no doubt) Some of the survivors claim his last words were “Such destruction… Why? Why? Why didn’t they tell me?!”\n\nThis massive devastation continued even after Godzilla killed all the Martians, apparently from some of the other survivor reports, he was tearing the place apart searching the entire island for something or someone. When he didn’t find it, he gave a roar and went back to Japan.\n\nAfter watching the news report, you turn to Gil.\n\n“Alright Gil what the hell did you do to your cousin? I mean what possibly could you’ve done to piss him off so bad? It’s not like you’re Rodan or Mothra.”\n“Eh, it’s not something I like to talk about Wolf. I’m not too proud of doing it, but…”\n“But what Gil? Out with it!”\n“Well…I kind of…impregnated his wife…I know what your next question is, and it’s a bit complicated so I won’t try to explain, but we aquatics mate a little differently than…”\n“Alright Gil! I don’t need to hear anymore!” you say, and then sudden you have to ask…\n“So wait a minute. You mean to say Minya was…”\n“Yep, he was my son. Why else would he blow smoke rings instead of radioactive fire and be so small?”\n“Well I thought it was because he was young.”\n“You probably haven’t kept up with Minya, but he’s STILL that size and still can’t breathe radioactive fire. My cousin knew something was rotten around Minya’s 10th birthday, since he should’ve grown a lot bigger by then as well as the fire stuff. His wife confessed everything. It’s another reason why I’m so reclusive.”\n\nYou just stare in disbelief at all this. Even with all the dirty secrets you’ve known about in this business, this one is definitely a new one for you. You don’t think you’ll be able to look at Godzilla OR Gil in the same light ever again.\n\nGodzilla might be King of the Monsters, but you have to give some sort of props to someone who fucked his wife and got away with it.\n",
  "page 70": "You begin to get angry at Moreau’s unwillingness to pay up.\n\n“Moreau I’m going to ask you ONE last time, I want my money!” you snarl.\n“You’re not getting anything from me! And you can stop threatening me, because it won’t work! I had to face angry tigermen and worse while attempting to turn this place into a Utopia! So you can just…”\n\nYou don’t let Moreau finish that sentence; you take a swipe at him with your claws, knocking him down. He slams his head into his desk and looks very still. Gil goes over to check on him.\n\n“He’s dead.” Gil says.\n“Damn, I didn’t mean to hit him so hard, I was just trying to scare him a bit.”\n“You dickhead! NOW what are we supposed to do?!”\n“Will you relax, I’m sure he’s got a safe or some place where he keeps the money, all we have to do is find it, it can’t be far.”\n”I’m not talking about that! I’m talking about he was the only one who could fly the plane of the island! How the hell are we supposed to leave now that he’s dead?! And do I need to remind you that my cousin is coming here? I didn’t want to be here anymore than you did when he arrived especially since he’s pissed at me!”\n“Oh shit, I didn’t think about that. FUCK! Wait a minute! What the hell are you worried about? All you gotta do is start swimming!”\n”Hey asshole, it’s the fucking ocean! SALTWATER! I can’t survive in that shit. Not for that long anyway. I might as well be swimming in vinegar.”\n“Hold on you better just calm the fuck down, and watch your tone Fishboy.”\n“Fuck you mangy land dwelling dog! I should’ve never listened to you!”\n\nGil is just as pissed at you as you are with him right now and you both act on your anger. A fight between you both occurs in the office, and eventually out in the middle of the town. Moreau’s freaks stand in disbelief, they’re unaccustomed to seeing such violence in a long time, and the younger ones have never seen it at all. Most of them just stand out of the way as you and Gil attempt to kill one another.\n\nYou fight for a couple days, and then the Martians arrive. When they see that the island is still inhabited they go into their kill all Earthlings routine and start killing the citizens of the island with ease, until they’re all dead. Meanwhile you and Gil are still beating each others brains out. The Martians decide not to interrupt and start placing bets; you’re the odds on favorite since Gil is starting to dehydrate at this point.\n\nAnother day passes and Godzilla finally arrives. The Martians attempt to fight back, but this is fucking Godzilla. He merely sneezes at their beam weapons and their saucers. Then he crushes the remaining ones under foot, destroying most of the island in the process.\n\nThen he notices Gil, and remembering whatever he did to piss him off, he decides to get some payback. Unfortunately you’re in the way of his “payback” and you’re both incinerated with one bellow of radioactive fire.\n",
  "page 75": "Gil and Moreau can shit themselves with fear, but you’re not going to sit around worrying about all this. You decide to get yourself a prime seat on that rocky plateau.\n\nAs you leave Moreau and Gil to their own devices, you walk through the town while the freaks all stare at you. That’s when you notice they have do have some livestock here after all. It looks like they just sheep for the wool purposes though. (Probably part of their economy) What a waste. You boldly go into the little grazing field and pick yourself up a couple of big fat sheep. A shepherd who looks like his origins lie with some sort of rodent, attempts to stop you from killing them.\n\n“Hey, those are my sheep, I’m afraid you can’t just…”\n\nYou punch out the ratboy and continue to kill your dinner while all the other freaks whisper amongst themselves about your behavior.\n\n“Fuck all of you pussy ass bitches, y’all oughta be glad I’m not eating any of YOU!” you say and continue to your destination.\n\nYou get to the plateau, and it really is a nice view. You can see the entire island from it. Not long after you get there you see Moreau’s plane leave.\n\n“Hmm, so much for sticking around to defend his Utopia.” You say.\n\nA day passes and you see the saucers come from the sky. A few of them land in the distance, while others are blasting the hell out of the towns scattered around the island. They’re too busy invading the populated areas though, so you’re safe. That’s when you also see Godzilla’s giant form looming in the distance.\n\n“Aw shit! This is going to be good!” you say preparing to watch the master in action.\n\nAs soon as Godzilla steps foot on the island he starts wrecking the place. The Martians attempt to fight back, but it’s useless. They can’t even beat humans; they stand even less of a chance against Godzilla. Their technology is like the equivalent of someone throwing a rock at a fully armored tank; a tank that can breathe radioactive fire.\n\nThe Martians are completely destroyed along with most of the island. Godzilla seems to stick around smashing the place, like he’s looking for someone, that’s when he notices you. Even from your high location, you’re still staring up at him from his belly.\n\n“RRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAGH! RAAAAAAAAAGH!”\n“Oh Gil? Yeah, he was here.” You shout holding your ears.\n“RRRRRRAAAAAAAGH! RRRRAAAAAGGGGGH!”\n“Yeah, I think he left with Dr. Moreau though. You just missed him a couple days ago.”\n”RRRRRAAAAGGGGHHH! RRRAAAAAGGGH!”\n“Okay I’ll let him know that, assuming I ever see him again.”\n“RRAAAAAAAAAGHHH! RRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAGGH!”\n“Okay bye then. And it was great to see you in action first hand!”\n\nGodzilla leaves and you’re now standing on a wrecked island. You’ll probably be stuck here for awhile, until the humans deploy ships to find out what the hell happened. This will all probably lead to another war between Earth and Mars again. Oh well.\n\nIn the meantime, the island isn’t complete wasteland, in fact parts of it are still intact and there are plenty of animals around and even some freak survivors are still alive. You’ll have plenty of food, lots of solitude as well. Hell, it’s like a vacation. You just realized you’ve never been on vacation ever in your life, but you’re taking the opportunity now. You even got to see a “big show”.\n\nAnd why not, you’ve deserved it.\n",
  "page 74": "“Hey look I got an idea…”\n“SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP WOLF!” Moreau screams.\n“I can’t believe I let you talk me into calling my cousin!” Gil says and then attacks you!\n\nYou and Gil start wailing on each other pretty good, eventually your fighting brings you both in the middle of the town where Moreau’s freaks look on in wide eyed wonder. They’re even more surprised when Moreau comes out with a silver fork and stabs you in the back with it.\n\n“Agh! What the fuck? Fuckin’ silverware? You’re gonna have to do better than that Freakmaker!” you say turning around, and slashing Moreau a couple times across the throat, killing him. Unfortunately you turned your back on Gil, who takes advantage of the fork in your back and drives it in deeper, puncturing vital organs.\n\nYou fall to the ground in extreme pain attempting to catch your breath, as Gil smashes your face into some rocks and reenacting a psycho killer tactic by repeatedly stabbing the shit out of you with the silver fork, until he’s sure you’re dead.\n\nGil’s revenge is short lived though. He’s killed in the big battle between the Martians and his cousin a few days later. In fact nothing on the island survives the battle except Godzilla.\n",
  "page 112": "“Alright I’ll take the job, just tell me where its at.” You say.\n\nAfter Erik gives you the information, you ride your Harley to the studio.\n\nWhen you arrive on the set, you see a bunch of snot nosed wolflings hanging around trying to look “tough”. Some of them are in human form, but you can smell them for who they truly are though. These cubs today, you swear they would’ve never lasted back in the old days. All flash and nothing to back it up. (Though you don’t mind looking at the young females that are there) That’s why they hang out in packs. You never did that even when you were young. You were always a lone wolf.\n\n“Hey who’s the fossil?” one of them asks.\n“Hey Grandpa, the remake of Old Yellow is next door!”\n\nThis causes a howl of laughter from all of them, until you confront the one who said it. Probably the leader no doubt. Not even in wolf form. Pathetic.\n\n“I’m going to give you time to transform into a more adequate fighting form before I neuter you.” You calmly explain.\n“You? You’re like 300 years old! I could take…”\n\nCan’t say you didn’t give him a chance.\n\nYou immediately pounce on him, knocking him down while clamping your jaws on his face and digging your fangs in.\n\n“HOLY SHIT DUDE!” one of them shouts.\n“Oh my god he’s killing him!” a female screams.\n“Get him off of him, get him off of him!”\n\nWhile them all attempt to pull you off of their leader you hear a familiar voice that gets your attention.\n\n“Well, I see Erik passed my script over to you, good. I’m also glad to see you’re still as anti-social as usual Wolf.” Mary says as you finally get off of your misguided heckler and approach her. She still looks the same, though she looks a lot better now that she got rid of that hair style she used to have and dyed it blonde.\n“Just re-establishing the proper hierarchy, nothing more.”\n“Hmm, always the Alpha Male, that was what I always loved about you. So primal. Maybe later I can dress in a little red cloak and we can reenact a fairy tale.”\n“Some fairy tale, as I remember you loved a lot of beings.”\n“Hey I can’t help who I am. I was created this way.”\n“Just like Frankie eh?”\n“Don’t you compare me to that sicko! Yes we are controlled by our genetics to a certain degree, but as you damn well know I rose above them! I made my own identity. I’m a successful director and writer now, so what if I have a healthy sexual appetite? There’s nothing wrong with that, I’m sure you’d agree given all the beings you had your way with before, after and DURING your marriage!”\n“Look never mind all that. I got a real problem with this film.” You say side stepping her correct accusation.\n“What’s wrong with it?”\n“What’s wrong with it? Are you kidding me? It sucks! It makes a mockery of werewolves! You even named one of them fucking Benji!”\n“Well comedy is popular now. Plus children like monsters just as long as they aren’t too scary, so I was hoping to make it a family film.”\n“ARRGH! I don’t DO family films! This is insulting and demeaning!”\n“How? Come on Wolf. In most horror movies you’ve made you always got killed in the end by a human, how was that any less demeaning?”\n“Because at least I was portrayed as feared monster that killed a bunch of people! I can play ball with the humans and their idealistic notion of good always having to overcome evil and all that…but THIS! This makes me into a fucking joke! I can’t even believe you of all people wrote this…no wait I can. You fucking undead don’t have any consideration for anyone, but yourselves.”\n“You know I’m technically not even undead, I’m created from several dead bodies. I’m more of a golem.” Mary attempts to correct you.\n“Who gives a shit, you’re still basically a walking corpse, and your flesh is dead. You’re Undead in my book.”\n“You know for someone who hasn’t been able to find a job in months and is basically just rotting away in his little cabin, you’d think that you’d be a little more appreciative. I wrote this with you in mind you hairy bigoted asshole!”\n\nYou don’t know whether to take that as an insult or as an attempt for her to try to make amends for the past.\n",
  "page 199": "You briefly entertain the idea of rushing Igor, he wouldn’t be able to get all of you, but you’re not ready to risk death at the hands of some deformed assistant after you already killed Victor and Frankie. You need to buy some time.\n\n“Alright Igor, just calm down. It’s over Vic and Frankie are dead. You don’t have to get pushed around by either one anymore and you got this whole castle as inheritance! I just did you a favor.”\n“A favor? A favor? You killed my younger brother you ASSHOLE!”\n\nYou quickly put two and two together.\n\n“Vic? Victor was your brother? Your younger brother?”\n“He damn well better have been, after all the abuse I took from him! You know what it’s like being abused by your younger brother on a daily basis for YEARS?”\n“Not really, I killed all my brothers soon after we were born. I wasn’t sharing. Survival of the fittest and all.” You say dryly.\n“Really? Well I envy you. I wish I had that option. But nooo. Mom liked Vic best. Vic was handsome. Vic wasn’t deformed, Vic this. Vic that! Look after Vic, Igor. Make sure he doesn’t get into trouble Igor. He’s your younger brother and you have to protect him Igor. I was the first born! Why didn’t Igor get any love?! I was the smart one!”\n“Yes you were. I mean if it hadn’t been for you Vic wouldn’t have even created Frankie.” You say.\n“Damn straight! I was the one who kept his ass alive! I’m the one that corrected all his idiot ideas when it came to updating Frankie! I’m not stupid like everyone says! I’m smart! And I demand respect! And I never fucking got it! I just got a fucking whip to the hump!”\n\nAt this point Igor is ranting so much about hating his brother and his self-pity, he’s not aiming his weapon at you any longer. You take advantage of the situation and rush at him, he’s not quick enough to react and you knock him to the ground before eviscerating him. Oddly after all that ranting, he dies gurgling an apology.\n\n“I’m sorry Vic…I tried…gurgle…”\n\nYou shake your head at Igor’s misguided loyalty, while the Pack surrounds you.\n\n“We won! You rule Wolf! What now?” one of them asks.\n“Dunno, didn’t expect to survive really…so did you get all this on camera Mary?” you ask out loud, startling the wolflings.\n\nMary comes out of hiding, with a camcorder.\n\n“How did you know I was here?” she asks\n“Please, I don’t forget a scent, especially one that I know quite intimately. So let me guess. You’re going to exploit this footage for financial gain right?”\n“Well yeah. When you left the studio I followed you a bit and found out you were heading here. At first I wanted to protect and help my family so I got here before you.”\n“What changed your mind?”\n“I realized what a bunch of miscreants and fuck ups they all were! What was I supposed to do? Be like Igor and stay loyal to a bunch of reprobates that wouldn’t appreciate it anyway? It’s not like they’re REALLY my family. So I just decided to film the epic battle since you ruined my original movie by taking this lot with you.”\n“I take it you didn’t care who won though.”\n“Not really, but if it makes you feel warm and squishy inside I suppose I was rooting for you more. You were the underdog after all…hey! That’s a great title for the movie!” Mary exclaims.\n\nThe Wolflings get a little restless about all this.\n“Hey shouldn’t we do something, I mean she’s part of this fucked up family, and she’s trying to exploit us!”\n“Ah see now this is another lesson I can teach you guys. You don’t need to be an asshole all the time, especially when there’s some benefit for not doing so. A lesson I probably should’ve obeyed more when I was your age. Mary’s little movie is made purely for exploitation, but its GOOD exploitation. It’ll show everyone who we are and that we’re NOT to be fucked with! This isn’t some shitty family movie. This is raw footage of werewolves doing what they do best, kicking ass! We couldn’t ask for better publicity. AND I assume we’ll be getting some money for this right Mary?”\n\nMary looks a little reluctant, but she realizes she has to give you something.\n“Right Wolf.”\n“That’s what I thought. Now the battle is good and all, but you’ll need to pad it out more, I say you start doing interviews with us. We can make this into a documentary! If you need more footage, we can always go bust up a bar…”\n\nAnd so it happens, Mary releases “Underdogs: The Inner Mind of the Wolf” in a bunch of pansy art theatres at first where it’s critically acclaimed. Later it gets released it regular theatres where most people like it mainly due to the brutal violence and your “colorful” interviews. You even win an award.\n\nThe movie makes Werewolves “cool” again and you’re never out of work anymore, which is a good thing since Ginger gave birth to a litter of cubs which YOU have to pay to support! You come home every day to the little nippers biting your ankles for your attention.\n\nStill, life is good and you once again have achieved the fame and fear you deserve.\n",
  "page 114": "The Monster: Frankie\n\nDr. Victor Frankenstein made Frankie out of the parts of dead bodies as everyone knows, but what wasn’t so well known at the time was he was using many of the parts from a graveyard where they buried insane asylum patients. The brain of an unstable sexual psychopath probably wasn’t the best choice. Even Igor tried to tell him it was a bad idea, but of course Victor knew it all so he went ahead with playing God. Victor probably wouldn’t have named his creation after himself if he knew what Frankie was going to do.\n\nFrankie had a… let’s say unhealthy interest in little girls.\n\nHe also was an idiotic bully who would try to push anyone around who was smaller. You’re all for the survival of the fittest ideology and might makes right. Hell you live by it. But you didn’t like the way he acted since he was a real pussy when someone actually stood up to him. You also didn’t like him because when he came on the scene, all of a sudden he was number two. It was bad enough you had to play second fiddle to that fucking bloodsucker, but NOW you were getting pushed out of the spotlight from some child molesting, walking stitch work of corpses. Fortunately he tripped up his popularity somewhat when the public became suspicious of his little “secret”. Yet despite being a sicko, he still somehow managed to draw in the money, you hated even being in the same “rank” as him.\n\nYou’ve never liked the undead as a rule, but Frankie was particularly loathsome to you. He always claimed he was “misunderstood” and couldn’t help the way he was. He couldn’t understand why some people hated him and chased him away with pitchforks and attempted to set him on fire.\n\n“Duh, it’s because you’re a goddamn pedophile you sick fuck.” as you so delicately explained one time.\n",
  "page 113": "No, no, no, no! The movie sounds like it sucks and you’re not going to deal with Mary after all the shit you got yourself into last time with her.\n\n“Fuck that Erik, there’s gotta be something else!”\n“Well there’s a comic convention that needs another guest speaker…”\n\nYou slam the phone down. You need to get out of the house. You decide to go for a walk in the forest.\nYou wander around in the calmness of the forest and nature in general. Sometimes you wonder if you shouldn’t just go back to living in the wild. Things were certainly simpler then. While you’re thinking about the nostalgia of the old days, you see a very large hairy body lying prone in the distance.\n\n“What the fuck…how the hell…” you mumble to yourself while going over to investigate. When you arrive, its exactly who you thought it was, though you don’t understand how you couldn’t have heard him lumbering through the forest given how big he is, let alone seen him.\n\n“Hey Kong! You alive? Wake up!” you shout. Kong stirs a little and then sits up to yawn. He scratches his now silverback and looks over at you.\n“Wolf? What’re you doing here?”\n“Me? I live just a few miles away! What’re you doing here and how is it that I didn’t see or hear you crashing through the forest?”\n“Oh I can be pretty silent when I want to be.”\n“Okay, but what’re you doing here?”\n“Back to nature my friend. Nancy kicked me out of the house. For good this time, she said she can’t put up with my chauvinism any more. All I told her was to get her ass back in the kitchen and make me a banana split and serve it to me naked.”\n“Sounds like a reasonable request, so what happened?”\n“She went into the kitchen, came back out with a frying pan of hot grease, threw the shit on me and kicked me in the balls, before shoving me out the door and calling me a fucking backward primate.”\n\nYou hold back some laughter, before speaking again.\n\n“Tough break there Kong, but I guess you could look on the bright side, you’re back to your roots with no more cares anymore. Living free in the wild and all.”\n“Are you on fucking crack Wolf? It sucks! You know when I lived on Skull Island I didn’t know any better, but in the last few days I’ve come to realize living in a warm HOUSE and sleeping in a bed is way better than living in the cold wild and sleeping on the ground where bugs crawl all over you!”\n\nKong’s remarks certainly have made you reconsider your previous nostalgia of the old days.\n\n“Well, can’t you just make up with Nancy? Surely if she’s put up with you this long and if you apologized and did all that romantic crap she’d let you back in.”\n“Don’t think so Wolf, I never was good at that, besides she’s got a restraining order on me too.”\n”What else did you do to her?”\n“Nothing! She’s just being a crazy bitch, that’s unwilling to listen to reason. Well unwilling to listen to me anyway. Hey Wolf, you’ve always been a smooth talker with ladies. Maybe you could talk some sense into her for me.”\n“Uh, I dunno Kong I don’t really like getting into the middle of shit like this, don’t you have someplace else to stay, hey what about your cousin Joe?”\n“I’m not staying with him! He’s a fucking fag!”\n“Well, beggars can’t be chooser Kong, besides he’s your cousin it’s not like you have worry about him trying any ass pirate shit on you. I’m sure he’s got a nice house too.”\n“Yeah, I guess…but I’d still prefer to go back to my own home, and I’m not sure if Joe would let me stay anyway. You gotta help me out Wolf, Nancy kicked me out with nothing, and I don’t even have any money in the bank. I don’t want to be living in the fucking wilderness again!”\n\nYou normally aren’t one to help someone for no reason, but there’s the fact that you don’t want him living that close to you, you don’t relish the idea of him taking big healthy dumps in a forest you live near, so to avoid wearing a clothespin on your nose for the rest of your time living here, you decide to help Kong.\n",

  "page 115": "The Bride: Mary\n\nThat entire wedding was an abomination.\n\nAfter the supposed “accidental” death of a little girl, Victor attempted to correct the problem by creating Mary. He figured if Frankie had a bride he could fuck her instead. Of course she was better made since Victor learned from the mistakes he made in Frankie. (This time he had Igor raid a regular graveyard)\n\nThe marriage was brief and embarrassing. Mary hadn’t been alive that long and it was obvious that she didn’t want anything to do with Frankie even though Victor created her with an increased sex drive. And since Victor could be considered the “father” of them both, and he married them to each other…well that just a bit twisted.\n\nMary didn’t have an identity. She didn’t even have the name “Mary” at that time. She was created solely as a sex toy for Frankie, an unused one to boot, since Frankie still had his sick fetish and didn’t take any interest in her at all. She was very unhappy in her role and pursued intellectual hobbies in her vast spare time. Eventually she took the name Mary after one of her favorite authors.\n\nHowever, she still had that BIG sex drive. She fucked everyone she could get her hands on behind Frankie’s back. It was only a matter of time before she got to you. And well, despite your prejudice against the undead, and the fact that you were married, and the fact she had a really bad hair-do, she was hot and you’re a big dog…\n\nYou and her had very long and passionate affair. You even looked past the fact that she was Undead.\nOf course it just happened to be your bad luck to be the one that actually got caught in the act, by Frankie himself one day. Now while Frankie didn’t have any interest in her, he didn’t want anyone else to have her either and since he didn’t like you too much anyway all hell broke loose.\n\nLong story short. You beat the shit out of Frankie, depriving him of some of his vital parts. Victor sued you for vandalizing his “property”. Your bitch divorced you and took everything. And Mary left Frankie for good for that damn bloodsucking bastard until they broke up later as well.\n\nYou really don’t like the undead.\n",

You always had a better way with words than I did, more diplomatic.”\n“That’s gotta be the first time I’ve ever heard someone call me diplomatic, but I’ll see what I can do, I’m not guaranteeing anything though.”\n\nKong gives you the address and you head back to your cabin where you get on you Harley and drive off. You have no plan whatsoever. You’re just going to fumble your way through and try to turn on the charm.\n\nEventually you get to the house which is huge, but then it would have to be to accommodate a couple of giants. You can’t even reach the doorbell, so you just kick the door and howl as loud as you can. A few minutes pass and you think you haven’t been heard, but eventually a colossal bald man with a towel wrapped around his waist opens the door, its Glenn. Well this was certainly unexpected. He looks down with a perturbed stare.\n\n“Yeah, whadda you want?” he booms.\n“Is Nancy home?”\n“Whadda ya want with Nancy, hairball?”\n“I have to talk to her, its important.”\n“Yeah, well I say it isn’t, now get the fuck outta here!”\n“Look, I’m not looking for trouble, just let me talk to Nancy it won’t take long.”\n“It won’t take long because you ain’t gonna do it, now get the fuck outta here you fucking mutt!”\n“Do you even know who I am?” you say starting to lose your temper.\n“Yeah I do, and if you don’t get the fuck outta here I’m gonna know who you WERE!”\n\nWhile you study his foot, and deciding which one of those big veins you’re going rip into before running off to hide, Nancy comes to the door in a silk robe. She’s kept herself in pretty good condition, either that, or the alien ray that hit her slowed down her aging process.\n\n“Glenn, what’s going on…oh hello Wolf. What bring you here?”\n“Hello Nancy, I need to talk to you for a moment.”\n“Nancy you want me to get rid of this hairball?”\n“No Glenn that’s not necessary, be nice.”\n“Yeah whatever, look I’m leaving, I’ll be back later tonight so you be ready for another round of the amazing colossal dick! Har har har har!” Glenn at this point slaps Nancy hard on her ass, and walks out the door and down the street with just the towel around him!\n\n“Uh, isn’t he forgetting something?”\n“Yes, but its not the first time. One time he left without even a towel.”\n“Yikes, that must’ve been a sight.”\n“(Sigh) Not really, he’s isn’t nearly as colossal as he thinks…but anyway come on in.”\n\nYou enter the house and follow Nancy into the kitchen who makes herself some coffee. You look up at the table trying to figure out the best way to climb up there; Nancy unexpectedly picks you up and puts on it.\n\n“Ohh your fur is so soft.” She says brushing her finger against your back. “So what did you have to tell me?”\n\n“Its about Kong, he’s taken residence in a forest not too far away from my cabin, he says you kicked him out and he wants to come back home.”\n“You have my sympathies, for getting him as a neighbor, but I’m not taking him back. I’ve put up with his shit for too long. I was an idiot thinking I could change him. Sometimes I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.”\n\nNancy’s pleasant demeanor has changed.

  "page 119": "“Well, I think it’s a lost cause with your wife, and to be quite honest I don’t want to get caught up in the drama, but I can go talk with your cousin Joe if you want.” You say.\n\nKong looks disappointed by your remark, and agonizes over making a decision, but finally gives you the okay.\n\n“Alright Wolf, but I don’t like this.”\n“You’ll like it even less, if you have to live out here, now gimme the address.”\n\nKong gives you the address and you go back to your cabin, start up your Harley and ride off. You don’t really have a plan, you’re just going to fumble through as usual, and you just hope Joe doesn’t hit on you.\n\nWhen you get to the house its very large like you expected, but not overly so. You notice the exterior is kept in very good condition, you have no doubt the inside looks like that as well. You get to the door and ring a doorbell that has been conveniently placed at your height level for normal sized guests.\n\nJoe opens the door and looks down.\n\n“Wolf? Well this IS a pleasant surprise! What brings you here, you perfect specimen of male?”\n\nWell no such luck of him not hitting on you.\n\n“Settle down there Joe, I’m just here to talk about your cousin Kong.”\n“Oh. Well what about him?”\n“He got kicked out by wife Nancy and now he’s living in a forest near my cabin, so can he stay here?”\n“So, Nancy finally threw that scrub to the curb eh? It’s about time girlfriend did that! Even I told her it was a bad idea for her to marry him. Well you have my sympathies Wolf, but I’m not having that homophobe living here! Though if you like YOU can live here!”\n“Uh, no. Besides I’m a homophobe too.”\n“Yes, but you’re a cute one!”\n“So all the GIRLS tell me. Look isn’t there anyway you’d reconsider? I mean he is family and all. I could tell him to behave himself, and he probably would since he really doesn’t want to be living in the wilderness again.”\n“Well…I guess, but surely you’ve noticed this place really isn’t built to accommodate his size. He’s a lot bigger than me you know.”\n\nYou could kick yourself for not realizing that before. You sigh, but ask if there are any arrangements that could be made.\n\n“Isn’t there anywhere here he could stay?”\n“Not unless I had a giant addition built on to my house and I’m not about to do that, I have this house just perfect the way it is.”\n“How about your backyard? Don’t you have a large backyard with a garden?”\n“Yes I do, and I’m not about to have that lug crushing all my flowers! However there is a nearby cave that’s in the backyard that could accommodate him. But I’m having problems with my backyard in general which I’m trying to fix as we speak.”\n“What kind of problems?”\n“My garden has been infested with those awful Triffids! Horrid things, making that noise and killing my workers! It’s really ruining my business at this point. I’d get rid of them, but they’re much too nasty for me! Those stingers hurt!”\n\nYou already know what he’s going to ask you, so you beat him to it.\n\n“If I get rid of these things can Kong stay in the cave?”\n“You’d do that? Oh thank you! And yes, if you saved my garden I’d take my cousin in.”\n\nWell that’s settled, get rid of the Triffids and Kong can stay, now you just have to figure out how to do it.\n",

You head around the side walls, and scale them. The barbwire on top is a bitch though and you end up getting your fur caught in it.\n\nAfter tugging and ripping yourself up, you fall off the wall into the mansion grounds, bleeding and surrounded by ant people.

There were a ton of aquatic sea monsters!”\n“Oh yeah, we ALL know each other. Damn land dweller ignorance. I bet we all look alike to too you right?” Gil says annoyed.\n“And I suppose you don’t think we all look alike?” you retort.\n“Alright nevermind. I don’t know though, most of the beings I know, tolerate land dwellers even less than I do. And most of them can’t even leave the water to begin with.”\n“I guess giant crabs and squids are out of the question then huh?”\n“You guess right.”\n“Damn.”\n“Okay well, I DO have a cousin that might help, but we haven’t spoken in years.”\n“Would he be of much help?”\n“Oh he’d be more than enough help; he doesn’t much care for aliens in general. In fact he doesn’t like anyone and is very violent.”\n“Sounds like a great guy.” You say.\n“Hmm, yes I’m sure you and he have a few things in common. He’s another that pointless picks fights and believes in proving his dominance whenever possible.”\n“Well get his ass over here!”\n“I don’t know if he’ll come, we had a fight about something a long time ago hence the reason we haven’t spoken.”\n“Gil, I know Moreau has at least one phone on this island. USE IT. NOW!”\n“Alright, I’ll try, but like I said I don’t know if he’ll come to help.\n\nYou and Gil make your way back to Moreau’s freak town where the freaks still give you strange looks. You knock on Moreau’s door.\n\n“Hey Moreau! Open up, Gil’s gotta use the phone.”\n\nMoreau looks as haggard as ever when he opens his door.\n\n“Damn Moreau, you look like shit, you really need to take better care of yourself. Eat some fucking meat. Anyway, Gil has a bad ass cousin apparently that can help, he just needs to call him.”\n“Wolf, I don’t know if he’ll come, and now that I’m thinking about it, I don’t know if I WANT him to come. He might still be pissed at me.”\n”Have some faith Gil.”\n\nGil picks up the phone and starts pressing a million numbers.\n\n“Where the hell does your cousin live, Gil?”\n“Japan. Oh I got a tone…here he is. Hello Godzilla?”\n\n“Your cousin is FUCKING GODZILLA?!” you ask.\n“Oh even I’ve heard of him, heard he was giant lizard that routinely defeated other monsters and aliens. Surely he’ll be able to help.” Moreau says hopefully.\n\nYou look at Moreau in disbelief, he apparently has been such a recluse he hasn’t even kept up on who the fuck Godzilla really is and the extent of his power. You know damn well if Godzilla comes here, the Martians will be destroyed, but so will everything else on the island!\n\n“It’s me. No don’t hang up! Look I’m sorry about that! I didn’t mean for that to happen! Come on I really need your help. I’m in a predicament and…”\n\nYou snatch the phone from Gil\n\n“Dammit, no matter what shit happened between you two, you should at least know how your cousin’s mind operates by now, Gil!” you say to Gil.\n\n“Hello, Godzilla? Big fan. My name’s Wolf you might know me, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t. Look there’s a bunch of fucking Martians coming down to Earth thinking they’re tough shit and acting like they’re going to own the place. Yeah I know you’re King of the Monsters here on Earth, but you know how all aliens are, they’re arrogant bastards. Okay. Oh why thank you! That was my favorite role; I got to kill 17 humans in that one! Glad to see you have heard of me. Alright bye.”\n\nYou turn to Moreau and Gil.\n\n“He’s coming.” You say.\n",
  "page 82": "Maybe you’re getting a little soft in your old age, but you can somewhat sympathize with Andre, he’s in an even worse situation than you. He’s been stricken by bad luck more than you have. Helping him could be financially beneficial, plus if Andre had a home, he wouldn’t be constantly bothering you for money every time you walked into town.\n\n“Alright Andre I’ll help, just stand back and get your fucking disease ridden hands off of me! And don’t touch me again!”\n“Okay, I can do that. Thanks Wolf! I swear I won’t forget this!”\n“Yeah, yeah, now what do you want me to do?”\n“I need you to deliver this letter to her; it’s a poem about how I feel about her and how I’ve always felt about her. I know if she just read this she’d give me a chance!”\n\nYou take the crumpled letter which reeks of Andre’s overall foulness, but you still have more questions.\n\n“Andre I know you’ve always wanted to do some buggery on Janice, but I hardly see how this is going to change how she feels and why the hell can’t you do this?”\n“Because every time I even try to get NEAR her mansion she has her guards chase me off! Its like when I try to sneak in anywhere people can somehow sense I’m coming!”\n“Andre, did it ever occur to you to that your fucking ODOR is the reason?”\n“Odor? What odor?” Andre asks like it’s the first time anyone’s ever suggested that to him that before. “Look I know in my heart that if she read my words, she’d fall for me, just like I know you’ll be able to get in and give her that letter!”\n“This is starting to sound like a lot of effort for possibly no reward…”\n“Arrrgh! Look when you get in there, you could always just rip something valuable off! Just please, you gotta give her that letter!”\n\nYou look at the love letter (which has remarkable penmanship) and shake your head. Looks like you’re on a bug hunt.\n\n“Alright Andre you’re lucky her mansion isn’t far and I’m not busy right now. I just turned down an offer to live on an island paradise for the rest of my life in exchange for getting rid some Martians.”\n“What, you mean Moreau’s offer? He offered me a similar deal, but then quickly retracted it for some reason. But Wolf I know you wouldn’t have wanted to help some hippy freaks you don’t even know! But this is different! In this case you’re helping out an old friend gain true love!”\n“Okay listen up, I’m not, nor will I ever be your friend. I’m doing this for my own reasons. When I return, meet me back here at this bar.”\n\nYou turn and eagerly leave Andre to go back to your cabin. You don’t normally like to wash, but in this case you definitely feel the need to! After thoroughly scrubbing down, you take your Harley and drive over to Janice’s mansion which is just a couple of counties away. It doesn’t take you long to get there.\n\nYou haven’t really seen this place except once a long time ago and it looked like a regular mansion, now the place looks like a concentration compound; there is a big metal gate and barbed wire lined walls surrounding the mansion. The mansion itself looks like some half weird insect hive, half man made structure. As soon as you park near the gate you’re approached by some figures marching in unison like soldiers. They’re like big ants or at least they look like THEM. Something weird is going on.\n\n“You! Inferior hairy mammal! What business do you have here at the Hive?!” one of the ant guards asks clicking his mandibles angrily.\n“I’m supposed to deliver a letter to Janice.”\n“Watch you tongue, dog! You mean the Supreme Hive Queen! And she does not see inferiors such as you! Be gone, you impotent mangy mutt!”\n\nWell you’re used to people not liking you, but hearing it from a giant bug is still pretty insulting.\n",
  "page 81": "You have absolutely no patience for this and you begin beating the hell out of Andre, starting by slashing him across his many eyes. Andre surprises you though by fighting back. Due to his diet he’s not exactly the best fighter, but he’s a lot stronger that you thought. You land a few bites on him which immediately cause you to puke since he tastes like a bleeding leper with gangrene. Andre counters with some puke of his own, unfortunately for you, his is acidic. Your arm is horribly burned to the bone.\n\nAfter howling in pain you summon up a reservoir of strength and put your fist through Andre’s chest and proceed to dig around deeply, pulling out all the nasty black stuff inside. Andre twitches and spasms for a good ten minutes before he dies. You stagger back home to nurse your wounds.\n\nAgainst any other opponent you probably would’ve just felt the pain for a couple of days, and regenerated back to your old self, but Andre WAS a fly and as such he was carrying multiple diseases both known and unknown. And during your fight he was spitting and bleeding all over you not to mention you bit him a few times. As a result you’ve been infected by some pretty nasty ones.\n\nOver the course of a few days you begin to get very sick and lethargic, if you were younger, your immune system might’ve been stronger to fight it off, but you don’t have that advantage anymore. You feel deathly ill and your fur is falling out, you refuse to die like this.\n\nYou drag yourself back into town and weakly attack the nearest human you can find. After the cops are called you attempt to attack them as well, but they shoot you full of silver before you can even get near them.\n",
  "page 84": "The Wasp Woman: Janice Starlin\n\nEven before she became another insect hybrid, she was a “WASP” in every sense of the word, though “Nazi” might be even more appropriate.\n\nJanice likes to keep her past a secret, but for those in the know, she was sympathetic to the Germans during WW II. It’s one of the reasons why she wasn’t in “showbiz” for too long. (Showbiz and Anti-Semitism isn’t a good combination)\n\nEven without being a Nazi sympathizer, she was still a stuck up rich human bitch who came from “Old Money”. She was obsessed with her youth and looks and being an actress she was even more fanatical about it. As with all humans they can’t stop the ravages time without a little help, either supernatural or scientific. She attempted supernatural first, and tried to get one of those parasitic bloodsuckers to turn her. It would’ve been perfect for her; the problem was no vampire was willing to do it. The bloodsuckers are monsters, but even they tend to frown upon Nazis. (Of course Werewolves aren’t fond of Nazis either) Indeed, most Vampires have roots in the “Old country” (Not any particular country, just all of them) and as such most originally have Slavic or even Jewish backgrounds. (Which might explain why crosses don’t really work so well in real life as opposed to the crap they show in movies) and since Fagula is the head cocksucker…erm bloodsucker in charge, no vampire was going to defy him, even if they wanted to.\n\nJanice resorted to scientific means, so she hired some mad scientist type who was working on a youth serum based on wasp jelly. You’re not exactly familiar with the technical stuff involved, but what basically happened was a typical mad scientist “accident” and the shit turned her into a half wasp creature. Though while not as spectacularly as bad as Andre’s “accident”, it was horrific for her and ended her career as a “normal” actress.\n\nThis transformation didn’t make her disposition any better, if anything she just got meaner and more condescending. When she “arrived” in the monster world, she constantly would go on about how she was superior to everyone else and why. (Though she didn’t say anything about the bloodsuckers since despite them shunning her she still always wanted to be one)\n\nAfter the show biz career started to dry up for her, she went back to being a typical rich shut in who never left her mansion. It’s not like she had to work, being independently wealthy and all.\n\nNobody’s really had any contact with her since.\n",
  "page 83": "The Fly: Andre Delambre\n\nFor every successful “Mad Scientist” there are several failed ones. Most of them usually get killed by their own fool creations, or in their attempt to rule the world. Others are just inept and can’t create anything worthwhile. Still others just have some very bad luck. Andre falls into that category.\n\nEveryone knows the story, Andre was working on a teleportation device and when he tested it out a fly got in the thing with him and turned him into the big bug he is today. Contrary to what the movies say, there was NOT a fly buzzing around with his head on it after the accident! It was more like “remake” where his DNA combined with the fly’s DNA, just one being, not two separate ones. (Though he did still have a big ol’ grotesque fly head afterwards.) Needless to say his career as any kind of scientist was over, while his intelligence hadn’t been reduced to that of a fly, it certainly lowered it from what it was, and tended to make him more focused on simpler things like eating. His marriage was over as well. (His wife got everything; a repulsive fly isn’t too sympathetic)\n\nWhile he did find a new life of sorts in horror after his accident, it was still limited. It’s not like being a werewolf or vampire, they don’t make multiple movies with rampaging fly people and it’s not like he could “pass” for human for other roles. It wasn’t just that though, the main problem was he was a disgusting disease carrying fly and nobody wanted to be around him! This of course made other jobs somewhat limited as well. His last hope was working in the “Sanitation Engineering” field, which he thought would be perfect, but the problem was he spent too much time eating garbage rather than picking it up. He was fired within the week. Eventually his money ran out and he became a bum which probably wasn’t that bad for him, indeed he was more “free” now; ironic, since he started out from poverty and worked his way up from the gutter when he was a human and stated he’d never want to be poor ever again.\n\nYou always avoided him for the same reasons everyone else did. He was just nasty smelling and looking. Despite your obvious dislike for Andre it hasn’t stopped him from all the times he’s tried to borrow money from you.\n",

  "page 121": "The 50ft Woman: Nancy Archer\n\nIf you were gigantic freak, you certainly would’ve tried to tap that ass, hell if you just had a freakishly gigantic dick, you would’ve tried to tap that ass, but some things just aren’t meant to be.\n\nNancy was just a normal rich human woman who was stuck in a bad marriage with an abusive cheating husband. The intelligent thing for her to have done would’ve been to leave him, but she had incredibly low self esteem due to his verbal abuse as well. So she just took all his abuse with a smile.\n\nThen one day some alien teenagers were fucking around with their toys on humans as usual and she got hit with some “Giant Ray”. She was horrified at first, but yet liberated. Her new size predictably had given her confidence. She didn’t waste any time, she immediately squashed her two timing abusive hubby and started a new life for herself. She did a few movies, but her main thing was modeling, mainly on those big billboards. Cancer sticks were popular back then so she had all kinds of contracts with cigarette companies. She was also a supporter of women’s’ rights and was also a big feminist.\nShe invented the slogan “You’ve come a long way baby”\n\nHowever, despite all her new found freedom and her new life, she was still deep down unfulfilled. For whatever reason, she still wanted someone in her life, she had some suitors, but turned them all down and it was around that time when Kong was down on his luck and they met. It seems strange that Nancy would be interested in him, as he wasn’t the most “enlightened male” (Compared to him, you were considered pretty “forward thinking”) however that might’ve been why she fell for Kong. She felt that she failed at her past marriage by not trying hard enough to change him and just avoided the problem by stomping it into a bloody pulp. Kong was a chauvinist dick, and had problems controlling his anger. This would be her second chance! Apparently Nancy still had some issues.\n\nAll of which goes to confirm what you’ve known all along, they can talk all they want about how they want a sensitive guy that does all that romantic shit 24/7, but more often than not chicks always fall for the dick.\n",
  "page 120": "King of Skull Island: King Kong\n\nNot King of the Monsters (That honor belongs to Godzilla) but Kong certainly ranks close. In some ways he has a similar background to yours, he was living in the wilderness before civilization came calling, but was exploited financially more by humans. (Whereas you just blew all your money on wine, women and divorce) Kong never was the sharpest knife in the drawer and from day one when those humans convinced him he could become a star; they milked the gravy train as much as they could. After all monkeys plus movie always equal big bucks (Okay he was really an ape, but nobody cares about technicalities) so Kong being the biggest means he would bring in even more.\n\nKong did become very popular and famous, but he wasn’t making nearly as much money as he should’ve been. That still wasn’t enough to lead to his ruin, what did that was his self destructive personality. He knew he couldn’t hold his fucking liquor yet he went and did it anyway which would always result in him paying out millions in reconstruction fees and his own hospital bills from multiple biplane wounds. While you’ve never been one to fit into “polite society” your normal size didn’t cause you to commit damage on a massive scale when you got drunk. (Though there was that one time in LA when you were on a two week drinking binge…)\n\nThere was also the fact if he thought some woman was pretty, he’d just grab her, which resulted in more legal trouble. He just had a hard time of grasping the concept of dating.\n\nFinally all this trouble was too much even for his agents and all the other humans exploiting him to put up with and they abandoned him finding out that sticking with normal sized monkeys was much easier, so Kong’s career was pretty much finished. He didn’t even have enough money to go back to Skull Island, not that he would’ve been able to live there, since it got turned into an amusement park.\n\nThings looked bleak for Kong until he struck lucky and Nancy took an interest in him and the two eventually married.\n",

Well I suppose there’s a first time for everything, alright Henry send in the victim.”\n\nNo sooner has the human entered the room, and you’ve already run up and drop kicked him in the face! You don’t allow him to get back up, and end up breaking one of his legs by totally destroying his knee. He’s in extreme pain and expresses it vocally.\n\n“Damn Wolf! What the hell!?” Henry shouts.\n“Hey you said not to kill him, you didn’t say anything about not breaking bones.”\n“Alright, drag him out, and bring in the next one.”\n\nThis goes on for the next five fights. The subjects are getting tougher, but so far you haven’t had too many problems. You’ve notice a severe change in the subjects though, mainly being bigger and more vicious, they’re starting to not even resemble humans anymore, and in fact they resemble “Mr. Hyde” but even more out of control. You look up where Henry is located and you notice he seems to be laughing and joking with Jack. He addresses you again.\n\n“How are you doing Wolf?”\n“I’m a little tired, but I’m okay.”\n“Okay Wolf, you’ve been doing well against one opponent, let’s see how you do against three.”\n“Hey, you’re supposed to be testing their fighting skills not mine.”\n“Well you’re kicking their asses, so I need to see them at least on equal footing.”\n“Who are they supposed to be fighting? If they’re fighting other humans then you’ve succeeded, there’s no way a normal human can beat those steroid freaks I’ve been fighting. I don’t even think most of the alien races, humans have come in contact with could stand up to them. I’d say your formula is a success.”\n“Wolf, I’m the scientist here, just a few more tests.”\n“Fuck that, I’m done. I’m going home and getting some sleep, I’ll be taking my money now.”\n\nWhen you try to go out the way you came in, a solid metal door slides from a hidden panel to block your way.\n\n“Don’t think so Wolf, we’re done when I SAY we are!” Henry then begins to laugh maniacally and when a Mad Scientist does that, well it’s never good. And it’s really not looking good when three lumbering hulks come through the opposite door all intent on doing you massive harm.\n",
  "page 145": "“Well, I think it’s a lost cause with your wife, and to be quite honest I don’t want to get caught up in the drama, but I can go talk with your cousin Joe if you want.” You say.\n\nKong looks disappointed by your remark, and agonizes over making a decision, but finally gives you the okay.\n\n“Alright Wolf, but I don’t like this.”\n“You’ll like it even less, if you have to live out here, now gimme the address.”\n\nKong gives you the address and you go back to your cabin, start up your Harley and ride off. You don’t really have a plan, you’re just going to fumble through as usual, and you just hope Joe doesn’t hit on you.\n\nWhen you get to the house its very large like you expected, but not overly so. You notice the exterior is kept in very good condition, you have no doubt the inside looks like that as well. You get to the door and ring a doorbell that has been conveniently placed at your height level for normal sized guests.\n\nJoe opens the door and looks down.\n\n“Wolf? Well this IS a pleasant surprise! What brings you here, you perfect specimen of male?”\n\nWell no such luck of him not hitting on you.\n\n“Settle down there Joe, I’m just here to talk about your cousin Kong.”\n“Oh. Well what about him?”\n“He got kicked out by wife Nancy and now he’s living in a forest near my cabin, so can he stay here?”\n“So, Nancy finally threw that scrub to the curb eh? It’s about time girlfriend did that! Even I told her it was a bad idea for her to marry him. Well you have my sympathies Wolf, but I’m not having that homophobe living here! Though if you like YOU can live here!”\n“Uh, no. Besides I’m a homophobe too.”\n“Yes, but you’re a cute one!”\n“So all the GIRLS tell me. Look isn’t there anyway you’d reconsider? I mean he is family and all. I could tell him to behave himself, and he probably would since he really doesn’t want to be living in the wilderness again.”\n“Well…I guess, but surely you’ve noticed this place really isn’t built to accommodate his size. He’s a lot bigger than me you know.”\n\nYou could kick yourself for not realizing that before. You sigh, but ask if there are any arrangements that could be made.\n\n“Isn’t there anywhere here he could stay?”\n“Not unless I had a giant addition built on to my house and I’m not about to do that, I have this house just perfect the way it is.”\n“How about your backyard? Don’t you have a large backyard with a garden?”\n“Yes I do, and I’m not about to have that lug crushing all my flowers! However there is a nearby cave that’s in the backyard that could accommodate him. But I’m having problems with my backyard in general which I’m trying to fix as we speak.”\n“What kind of problems?”\n“My garden has been infested with those awful Triffids! Horrid things, making that noise and killing my workers! It’s really ruining my business at this point. I’d get rid of them, but they’re much too nasty for me! Those stingers hurt!”\n\nYou already know what he’s going to ask you, so you beat him to it.\n\n“If I get rid of these things can Kong stay in the cave?”\n“You’d do that? Oh thank you! And yes, if you saved my garden I’d take my cousin in.”\n\nWell that’s settled, get rid of the Triffids and Kong can stay, now you just have to figure out how to do it.\n",
  "page 5": "You wake up in your cabin in the woods. You sit up and scratch some fleas that have infested your body. You also realize its still daylight. You hate waking up early.\n\nYou lope into the bathroom and look in the mirror where you see a canine face covered in gray fur, you remember a time when your fur was completely brown.\n\n“You’re getting old Wolf” you say to yourself like you always do while trying to look on the bright side that at least you don’t have the mange. You think you’d just put a silver bullet in your head if you ever started to go bald.\n\nAfter eating some left over mutton in the fridge and some Gummy Blobs (for the sugar “pick me up”) you ponder how you’re going to pay this month’s rent on your cabin. You call your agent Erik and see if that little pissant has found any work for you. Hopefully it’s an actual job and not just a guest speaker spot at a comic convention.\n\n“Erik! It’s me Wolf! Pick up the fucking phone! I know you’re there!” you say when you get the answering machine.\n\n“Erik! Get on the phone NOW, or I’m gonna go over there and shove a pipe organ up your ass!”\n\nThat got his attention.\n\n“Wolf, I’m sorry, but I fear I’m in a deep depression.”\n“What else is new? Look I need some work, got anything? I don’t even care if it’s straight to video. I just need some of the green stuff!”\n“Sadly, I don’t think I do, but then I haven’t really checked…I’m so depressed. I’ve been wondering if I made the right decisions in my life…and now it’s too late for me to do anything about it, because I’m old…”\n“Join the fucking club Erik! Look do you…”\n“But my art, my music, that is my love and its failing me again. My latest opera isn’t doing well. I wonder if I chose the wrong thing to love and pursue. Just like I did with Christine. Oh Christine WHY couldn’t you have loved me? I loved you…”\n\nWonderful, he’s in full blown tortured artist mode. He can go on like this forever. You can either give up, or persist in getting something out of him.\n",
  "page 18": "As much as you don’t trust him, you have to admit Jack has never really done anything against you in all the time you’ve known him. If anything he’s always attempted to be friendly. Is it possible you’ve just been an asshole to him, for no good reason?\n\nProbably, but it wouldn’t be the first time and that’s all in the past. You take the bottle and down its contents.\n\n“(BURP!) I don’t feel any different.”\n“Oh you will trust me.”\n“I’ve put more than enough trust in you already, better not be trying anything Jack, because I swear I WILL get my revenge on you, if this is a fucking trick!”\n“Not a trick, everything I’ve told you is the truth, you’ll see.”\n“Yeah, we’ll see.”\n\nWhen you enter the arena area, it’s just a big empty white room with another door on the other side of it. High above you can see Henry on an upper floor with a clipboard behind some glass. He waves to you and speaks into a microphone.\n\n“Okay Wolf, we’re going to start off slow, this subject hasn’t been injected with as much of the formula so I’m guessing you shouldn’t have any problems with him. Try not to kill him though, since we DO want some of them to survive!”\n“No killing eh? Well I suppose there’s a first time for everything, alright Henry, send in the victim.”\n\nNo sooner has the human entered the room, and you’ve already run up and drop kicked him in the face! You don’t allow him to get back up, and end up breaking one of his legs by totally destroying his knee. He’s in extreme pain and expresses it vocally.\n\n“Damn Wolf!

All you’ve notice is a severe change in the subjects, mainly being bigger and more vicious, they’re starting to not even resemble humans anymore, and in fact they resemble “Mr. Hyde” but even more out of control. But you haven’t even broken a sweat during all of this, it’s like you’re in your prime again. It must be Jack’s formula. Looks like he didn’t lie. You look up where Henry is located and you notice he seems to be ranting and yelling at Jack. He addresses you again.\n\n“How are you doing Wolf?”\n“Great! I haven’t felt this good in years!”\n“Hmm, well I guess I haven’t been trying hard enough! Wolf, I’m sending three of them in there, try to beat that!”\n“Hey, you’re supposed to be testing their fighting skills not mine.”\n“No Wolf, I’m supposed to be KILLING you, but you’re too fucking stupid to die properly! Well that ends now!”\n\nLooks like Jack was telling the truth about that too, you attempt to leave the way you came in but, a solid metal door slides from a hidden panel to block your way. Even your increased combat abilities can’t make more than a dent in it. Henry then begins to laugh maniacally and three lumbering hulks come through the opposite door all intent on doing you massive harm.\n\nHowever, you don’t have any fear about this situation, you’re confident that you can take them and you do just that! You’re literally a whirlwind of fury and violence. Bones are broken, flesh is ripped, faces are bitten and balls are stomped and happily none of them are yours. As you stand over the three large mutilated corpses you look up at the observation area and see only Jack standing there to address you.\n\n“Hey Jack! Let me outta here, I got a score to settle with that fucking pussy Henry!”\n“Uh, Wolf, you might want to prepare yourself, Henry said he’s coming down to handle you himself.”\n“What as Mr. Hyde? Pfft! Yeah, I’m really worried. He’s nowhere near as vicious as these fucktards were. I had to bail him out of most of the fights he started in the past. Sure he looked scary, still couldn’t fight worth a shit though.”\n\nSuddenly a very large figure smashes through the wall opposite you, its Mr. Hyde and he’s a LOT bigger and uglier than the last time you saw him. He’s easily larger than the last three subjects you just put down.\n\n“WOLF!!!” he bellows.\n\nOkay somebody just overdosed on the “formula”.\n",
  "page 144": "No, no, no, no! The movie sounds like it sucks and you’re not going to deal with Mary after all the shit you got yourself into last time with her.\n\n“Fuck that Erik, there’s gotta be something else!”\n“Well there’s a comic convention that needs another guest speaker…”\n\nYou slam the phone down. You need to get out of the house. You decide to go for a walk in the forest.\nYou wander around in the calmness of the forest and nature in general. Sometimes you wonder if you shouldn’t just go back to living in the wild. Things were certainly simpler then. While you’re thinking about the nostalgia of the old days, you see a very large hairy body lying prone in the distance.\n\n“What the fuck…how the hell…” you mumble to yourself while going over to investigate. When you arrive, its exactly who you thought it was, though you don’t understand how you couldn’t have heard him lumbering through the forest given how big he is, let alone seen him.\n\n“Hey Kong! You alive? Wake up!” you shout. Kong stirs a little and then sits up to yawn. He scratches his now silverback and looks over at you.\n“Wolf? What’re you doing here?”\n“Me? I live just a few miles away! What’re you doing here and how is it that I didn’t see or hear you crashing through the forest?”\n“Oh I can be pretty silent when I want to be.”\n“Okay, but what’re you doing here?”\n“Back to nature my friend. Nancy kicked me out of the house. For good this time, she said she can’t put up with my chauvinism any more. All I told her was to get her ass back in the kitchen and make me a banana split and serve it to me naked.”\n“Sounds like a reasonable request, so what happened?”\n“She went into the kitchen, came back out with a frying pan of hot grease, threw the shit on me and kicked me in the balls, before shoving me out the door and calling me a fucking backward primate.”\n\nYou hold back some laughter, before speaking again.\n\n“Tough break there Kong, but I guess you could look on the bright side, you’re back to your roots with no more cares anymore. Living free in the wild and all.”\n“Are you on fucking crack Wolf? It sucks! You know when I lived on Skull Island I didn’t know any better, but in the last few days I’ve come to realize living in a warm HOUSE and sleeping in a bed is way better than living in the cold wild and sleeping on the ground where bugs crawl all over you!”\n\nKong’s remarks certainly have made you reconsider your previous nostalgia of the old days.\n\n“Well, can’t you just make up with Nancy? Surely if she’s put up with you this long and if you apologized and did all that romantic crap she’d let you back in.”\n“Don’t think so Wolf, I never was good at that, besides she’s got a restraining order on me too.”\n”What else did you do to her?”\n“Nothing! She’s just being a crazy bitch, that’s unwilling to listen to reason. Well unwilling to listen to me anyway. Hey Wolf, you’ve always been a smooth talker with ladies. Maybe you could talk some sense into her for me.”\n“Uh, I dunno Kong I don’t really like getting into the middle of shit like this, don’t you have someplace else to stay, hey what about your cousin Joe?”\n“I’m not staying with him! He’s a fucking fag!”\n“Well, beggars can’t be chooser Kong, besides he’s your cousin it’s not like you have worry about him trying any ass pirate shit on you. I’m sure he’s got a nice house too.”\n“Yeah, I guess…but I’d still prefer to go back to my own home, and I’m not sure if Joe would let me stay anyway. You gotta help me out Wolf, Nancy kicked me out with nothing, and I don’t even have any money in the bank. I don’t want to be living in the fucking wilderness again!”\n\nYou normally aren’t one to help someone for no reason, but there’s the fact that you don’t want him living that close to you, you don’t relish the idea of him taking big healthy dumps in a forest you live near, so to avoid wearing a clothespin on your nose for the rest of your time living here, you decide to help Kong.\n",
  "page 8": "You and Moreau have never had any dealings with each other before, so you’re kind of curious to as why he wanted to see you. You approach Moreau and he’s tripping over himself to thank you for seeing him. You’re a little suspicious of this treatment, especially since you’ve never been welcomed by anyone before.\n\n“Wolf, its Wolf right? Or do you prefer Mr. Wolf?”\n“Wolf is fine…will you tell me why the hell you want to see me so badly for? We’ve never had anything to do with each other before.”\n“Yes. Quite correct. My Vision didn’t lead me to interact socially that much. Maybe I shouldn’t have concentrated so much on my Vision though. Maybe I should’ve been more flexible. If I had, I might not have the problems I have now.”\n“Okay, so will you quit with the fucking mystery already and tell me what’s going on?”\n“As you know I transformed my island into a utopia where no being harms another.”\n“Pfft, some Utopia. I call it fucking with nature.”\n“And you know what? I agree with you. At one time, I would’ve dismissed you as a vicious animal that only pleased his primal instincts.”\n“You say it as if it’s a bad thing.” You utter.\n“I once thought so…but now I’m starting to see reality for the first time. My Utopia wasn’t followed by the world…it was hated. It was despised. Most are jealous of what I’ve done and want to destroy it.”\n“Duh, that’s humanity for you. So are you getting to the point anytime soon?”\n“My Utopia is about to be destroyed, but NOT directly. No human nation wants to look like the bad guys so you know what they’ve done instead? They’re letting Martians do it for them!”\n“What? Martians aren’t even allowed on this planet after all the unsuccessful attacks they’ve attempted on it.” You exclaim.\n“See that’s just it. In exchange of a new Martian-Earthling Peace accord they’re letting the Martians put a colony here provided they don’t kill any humans. The Martians agreed and MY Island was scheduled for designation for the colony! If we stay they’ll be allowed to kill everyone since nobody on there is human except me.”\n“Well that certainly does suck, but why not just move?”\n“WHAT!? That’s our home! Would YOU move from your own home?”\n“Eh…I suppose I can see your point. So what am I supposed to do though?”\n\nMoreau takes another drink and looks at you with dead seriousness.\n\n“I need you to get them all to FIGHT! I need you to get them all in touch with their animal instincts again! I know you’re more than just a werewolf. You’re the self-proclaimed Alpha. I need that viciousness, I need that aggressiveness, I need it ingrained into my people. I can’t do it. I’m not qualified, and I’d only make things worse. I can pay you all the money you want; our economy has always been good. If you like you could even live on the island and spend your remaining years there with nothing to worry about. You could mate with whoever you wanted, we could import whatever meat you wanted, or if you preferred…we could even make special arrangements just for you, to hunt living creatures. Anything…just please help us.”\n\nThis is pretty heavy shit. Moreau must be very desperate to come begging to a practical stranger. There’s no way he’s lying about this, you have heard some stuff lately about Martian-Human relations, though you don’t really pay attention to the news a lot. You can’t say Moreau’s offer isn’t appealing on some level, but as much of a badass you are, you’re not in your prime anymore. Taking on a shit load of Martians and training a bunch of genetic freaks of nature could be just a little out of your scope.\n",
  "page 147": "“Alright Kong I’ll go talk to Nancy.”\n“Cool. You always had a better way with words than I did, more diplomatic.”\n“That’s gotta be the first time I’ve ever heard someone call me diplomatic, but I’ll see what I can do, I’m not guaranteeing anything though.”\n\nKong gives you the address and you head back to your cabin where you get on you Harley and drive off. You have no plan whatsoever. You’re just going to fumble your way through and try to turn on the charm.\n\nEventually you get to the house which is huge, but then it would have to be to accommodate a couple of giants. You can’t even reach the doorbell, so you just kick the door and howl as loud as you can. A few minutes pass and you think you haven’t been heard, but eventually a colossal bald man with a towel wrapped around his waist opens the door, its Glenn. Well this was certainly unexpected. He looks down with a perturbed stare.\n\n“Yeah, whadda you want?” he booms.\n“Is Nancy home?”\n“Whadda ya want with Nancy, hairball?”\n“I have to talk to her, its important.”\n“Yeah, well I say it isn’t, now get the fuck outta here!”\n“Look, I’m not looking for trouble, just let me talk to Nancy it won’t take long.”\n“It won’t take long because you ain’t gonna do it, now get the fuck outta here you fucking mutt!”\n“Do you even know who I am?” you say starting to lose your temper.\n“Yeah I do, and if you don’t get the fuck outta here I’m gonna know who you WERE!”\n\nWhile you study his foot, and deciding which one of those big veins you’re going rip into before running off to hide, Nancy comes to the door in a silk robe. She’s kept herself in pretty good condition, either that, or the alien ray that hit her slowed down her aging process.\n\n“Glenn, what’s going on…oh hello Wolf. What bring you here?”\n“Hello Nancy, I need to talk to you for a moment.”\n“Nancy you want me to get rid of this hairball?”\n“No Glenn that’s not necessary, be nice.”\n“Yeah whatever, look I’m leaving, I’ll be back later tonight so you be ready for another round of the amazing colossal dick! Har har har har!” Glenn at this point slaps Nancy hard on her ass, and walks out the door and down the street with just the towel around him!\n\n“Uh, isn’t he forgetting something?”\n“Yes, but its not the first time. One time he left without even a towel.”\n“Yikes, that must’ve been a sight.”\n“(Sigh) Not really, he’s isn’t nearly as colossal as he thinks…but anyway come on in.”\n\nYou enter the house and follow Nancy into the kitchen who makes herself some coffee. You look up at the table trying to figure out the best way to climb up there; Nancy unexpectedly picks you up and puts on it.\n\n“Ohh your fur is so soft.” She says brushing her finger against your back. “So what did you have to tell me?”\n\n“Its about Kong, he’s taken residence in a forest not too far away from my cabin, he says you kicked him out and he wants to come back home.”\n“You have my sympathies, for getting him as a neighbor, but I’m not taking him back. I’ve put up with his shit for too long. I was an idiot thinking I could change him. Sometimes I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.”\n\nNancy’s pleasant demeanor has changed. This is a delicate situation, say the wrong thing and you could be in real danger.\n",
  "page 7": "Well despite your distrust of Jack, Henry’s always been alright and you could use the easy money. If it doesn’t sound like a good deal to you, you can always decline. You sit down with them both, keeping a constant eye on Jack, well his clothing anyway.\n\n“Hey Wolf, glad to see you, it’s been awhile. I remember when we used to tear up places like this back in the day.” Henry says.\n“Yeah, the good old days.” You say agreeing.\n“When we were young and a lot more active.”\n“Speak for yourself Henry.” You stand up and start punching and kicking. “I’m still active and I’m only as old as I feel which isn’t old at all! I can still… OW!” you get a slight sprain in your back when attempting to demonstrate your “youthful” combat abilities.\n“No, Wolf you’re not old at all.” Jack snickers.\n“Shut the fuck up Jack, I just haven’t been in a proper fight in awhile, I’m a little out of practice. Say, how about I practice on YOU?”\n“Uh, okay calm down Wolf! Jack! We’re not here to antagonize anyone!”\n“You’re right so let’s get all this catch up shit out of the way. Wolf, we got an experiment for you that should be right up your alley. It involves you testing those skills you claim you still have.”\n“Oh yeah? What kind of experiment is this?”\n\nHenry interjects before Jack can continue.\n\n“Well the government hired us to develop something that increased combat ability. We’ve been testing it on humans and the results have been good so far, however we want to see how good it is, so we wanted to test them against non-human opponents, you came to mind since well you ARE the Alpha Wolf and despite your age, you are probably the best the Werewolf race has to offer as far as combat skills. I figure you’re still worth 10 of the cubs nowadays. Plus I know you like to kick ass and get paid for doing it. You know how the government likes to throw money around when it comes to new weapons, so I figure we can spare five thousand for your help.”\n",
  "page 146": "You figure Joe wants his garden still intact hence the reason he never used toxic chemicals, you prepare yourself for battle and enter the backyard which is littered here and there with dead human workers. The Triffids instantly sense you and begin to crawl slowly over towards you.\n\nFighting them isn’t really that hard, Joe probably kept getting stung due to the fact that he’s a larger target and isn’t as fast as you. You easily avoid their stingers and carefully avoid getting surrounded as you turn them into Caesar salad. Soon you’re finished! You knock on the back door and Joe answers.\n\n“All finished Joe.”\n“What already? Wow, you’re efficient! Maybe you should stick around to help me on a regular basis.”\n“Don’t think so, but nice try. So Kong can stay then?”\n“Of course, I keep my word, (Sigh) I’m going to have to hire all new workers though, I’m really going to take a loss this year.”\n\nYou turn briefly around and see someone coming out of the cave.\n\n“Hey Joe, looks like you won’t have to hire all new workers, there’s one coming out of the cave, guess some of them were hiding in there huh?”\n\nJoe looks over and another one comes out, then another.\n\n“That’s weird…I thought he was…now wait I know he’s…I saw!”\n“What? What’s going on?” You ask.\n“I saw those workers die! I saw the damn Triffids kill them right before my eyes! How can they be over there alive!?”\n\nAt first you think zombies, but that can’t be it. Then you notice one of the dead bodies looks very similar to one of the ones coming out of the caves, and that’s when you know what you’re dealing with.\n\n“Uh Joe, you got something worse than just a Triffid infestation, you got fucking Body Snatchers! Fucking Pod People man!” you exclaim.\n\nAt this point a bunch of them have just come out of the cave and they all look in your direction and let out an ear piecing screech while pointing at you.\n\n“Oh no! Wolf can you kill them too?” Joe asks as they advance.\n",
  "page 2": "Fuck it, you don’t feel like putting up with Erik’s whining. You’ll talk to him later when you’re in the mood. You hang up and decide to engage in one of your favorite past time ever since you became part of “society”. Drink. You head down to the bar in town.\n\nWhen you enter you see it nearly empty. Usually there’s someone here that you don’t like which gives you an excuse to get into a fight. You sit down and order a Scotch. The bartender tends to let you just drink and cleans up the mess you make afterwards, but today turns out a little differently.\n\n“Hey Wolf, some people have been wanting to see you.” The bartender says nervously.\n“Oh? Do these people have a name?” you ask downing your drink.\n“Well they’re in the bar right now actually, I think they’re old acquaintances of yours.”\n\nYou scan the bar, which doesn’t take long considering its almost empty. And you’ll be damned you see not one, but THREE people from the old days; you’re surprised you didn’t notice them before.\n\nAt a nearby table you see Dr. Henry Jekyll and Dr. Jack Griffin. Jack normally would be difficult to see in this dark lighting at the best of times, since he’s invisible, but he’s perfectly noticeable enough when he wears clothing. They see you and wave you to come over.\n\nAt a table in the far corner you see Dr. Alphonse Moreau. He looks like a wreck. He’s obviously been chain smoking cigarettes and drinking a lot since he got here. He sees you and desperately signals you over like he needs your help severely.\n\nWhile you’re not surprised to see all these humans still alive (Mad scientists ALWAYS figure out how to extend their life spans past the normal human limit) you’re just surprised that they all want to see you and it makes you suspicious. You’ve always been mistrustful of Mad Scientist types ever since your run in with Dr. Victor Frankenstein.\n\nYou turn to the bartender for more information.\n\n“What the hell, is there a Mad Scientist convention in town or some shit? Why are they all here and why do they want me?”\n“I dunno Wolf. I think its just coincidence. Henry and Jack say they got some sort of experiment going on and want your help on it. They know you’ve been needing some money lately and they’re willing to pay you for your time. I think Henry wants to play catch up with you as well.”\n“Hmm, speaking of catch, there probably is one. So why’s Moreau here? Same thing?”\n“He wouldn’t elaborate too much. He says he REALLY needs help with something, and it’s not an experiment. He says he gave up trying to play God. I dunno what’s wrong though you’ll have to ask him yourself. He just said, he’s willing to do anything for you if you help him.\n\nWell this venture to the bar seems to have become potentially lucrative; the problem is you have to deal with a bunch of humans with God complexes. (You doubt what the bartender told you about Moreau, his type never gets out of the game completely) You decide to throw caution to the wind and take one of their jobs; you feel you’ll be up to the challenge. After all its common knowledge of what you did to Victor when he tried to take advantage of you once.\n\nAll it comes down to is who you want to deal with.\n",

I just…”\n“I see your time with that bloodsucker was well spent. Learning how to exploit and leech right? Look maybe you can pull this shit with those puppies over there, but I ain’t fucking one! I don’t need the money that badly. I’ll go fucking live my twilight years in the forest and DIE there as nature probably intended. I don’t need this shit.”\n\nAs you turn to leave, Mary shouts at you.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right go on leave Mr. Lone Wolf! You’ll fucking die alone, you stubborn bastard! I tried to help you! Erik tried to help you and you don’t appreciate any of it! That’s why none of your children speak to you and…”\n\nYou run back over to her and slam her into the wall. You stare at her face to face as she struggles to get free. She’s strong, but you manage to keep her pinned. She really pissed you off and you were already pissed off to begin with.\n\n“Fuck you, and fuck Erik! You two don’t know shit about me, never did. I’m through with the pair of you! In fact I think I’ll be taking something with me since you’re so worried about me being alone…”\n\nYou release Mary and go over to the wolflings who look a little worried that you’re going to cause harm to them. Many of them cast their eyes downward.\n\n“Hey, you want to be REALLY tough? You want to really raise some hell? Come with me. If you want to stay under the thumb of this patchwork dead bitch and be exploited and mocked, stay here.\n\nYour statement alone convinces all of them. They all follow you, even the one you made an example of. Mary attempts to call everyone back, but it’s useless, you’ve taken control of the pack and they’ll do what you want now.\n\nAnd right now you want to get into a fight. You think about all the people and creatures that wronged you in some way and only two of them keep coming to mind consistently.\n\nOne is that fucking Dr. Victor Frankenstein. If it wasn’t for him, Frankie and Mary wouldn’t have been created in the first place which also means you wouldn’t have gotten yourself into trouble all those years ago. You wouldn’t have had to put up with his “children” taking jobs away from you. Not to mention he sued you once.\n\nBut the one who you REALLY despise, is that bisexual bloodsucker. Fucking Dracula or Vlad, or whatever the hell he’s calling himself these days. The disgust you have for him and the reasons are too numerous to list here.\n",

And at least you’ve got another job to fall back on LIKE BEING AN AGENT THAT’S SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING ME A FUCKING JOB!” you snarl.\n\nThere’s some dead air briefly and then Erik begins talking again.\n\n“You’re right. I shouldn’t be complaining about my problems to you. You of course know all about torment. A war that wages within you, a beast that…”\n“Erik I’ve got no time and I’m in no mood to hear how we’re supposed to be kindred spirits, you just better tell me you found something for me and it better not be another guest speaker spot at a comic convention!”\n“Well let’s see…I dunno. Werewolves aren’t popular anymore you know…there might be something…here it is! It’s called Wolf Pack.”\n“Pack? That implies more than one wolf on the set there Erik. Well I suppose I can share the spotlight with some others. As long as I’m in charge of course.” You say.\n“Er…well according to this, you’d be the old cranky grandpa wolf that makes a bunch of rude remarks.”\n“What?! What kind of stupid shit is that?”\n“Yeah that’s the stuff.” Erik replies not catching on.\n“I mean what the hell kind of movie is this?”\n“Its uh…let’s see…oh here. It’s a horror comedy about a werewolf family and how they\nadjust to human society. Looks like you’ll be playing with a lot of young pups as you’d call them.”\n“WHAT?! NO! What the fuck Erik? I’m a fucking monster not something to be fucking laughed at! And they already did a movie like that a long time ago and it sucked!”\n“Well that’s all I got. Maybe you could talk to the director to make changes since they also wrote it. I’m sure you and her are familiar with each other. You had an affair with her for quite some time.”\n“Uh, you wanna narrow that list down Erik?”\n“It’s Mary. You know, the one who used to be married to Frankie, until your affair broke up both of your marriages?”\n\nErik’s new information didn’t exactly make you any more enthusiastic to want to take the job.\n",

I just jumped from one abusive marriage to another!”\n“Erm…Kong doesn’t beat you does he? Because if that’s the case then…”\n“Oh no, he’s never done that. If that ever had happened, I would’ve kicked him out a long time ago.”\n“Well, maybe I was wrong and you did change him a little then. I mean if you knew Kong back in the day, he had real temper problems. It seems like you did have some effect on him.”\n“Maybe…”\n“Look how about I go back and talk to…”\n\nSuddenly the doorbell rings.\n\n“Hold on Wolf let me get that.”\n\nWhile you wait for Nancy to come back, you think you’re on the right track to convincing her to take back Kong. Then she arrives in the kitchen with some big ass roses and happily reading a card.\n\n“Where the hell did you get those things? Hey are those from Kong?” you say hopefully.\n“No.”\n“They aren’t from Glenn are they?” you ask a little more worried.\n“Pfft, yeah right.”\n“So who are they from?”\n“Oh they’re from Ymir, he probably had Joe specially grow them for me…he’s so sweet and sensitive.”\n”You’re fucking Ymir too?!” you exclaim.\n“No, he just leaves me presents with cards on my doorstep. He’s so shy, I wish he wasn’t though, because I wouldn’t mind seeing him. He writes the most romantic things…”\n\nNancy begins to day dream about Ymir and now you’re back at square one again. Still, you do wonder if she shouldn’t be with Ymir. Nancy does seem like a nice girl and she probably deserves better than Kong, and certainly deserves better than Glenn.\n",
  "page 4": "The Phantom: Erik Claudin\n\nOnce known as the “Phantom”. Erik was always a whiney wannabe monster. All he really was; was an ugly human who couldn’t play the organ worth shit and was obsessed over some dumb French broad by the name of Christine Dubois.\n\nHe always insisted on hanging out with you back in the old days for some reason. He thought you and he had some sort of inner tortured soul connection. It was all you could do to keep from ripping his throat out half the time. Erik eventually got so desperate to write a famous opera he made deal with the Devil, who granted him all his wishes of being a popular musician and composer. (One of his wishes was also an extended lifespan so he could enjoy his success for a long time before going to his eternal damnation)\n\nOf course any deal with the Devil has a catch. The Devil never promised him consistent success. So not all of his operas do all that well. The other thing was the French broad that Erik had the major hard on for never loved him even when he became famous, it turned out she was a lesbian. (One wonders why he just didn’t just add her to the contract he made with the Devil. He says he wanted her to love him for “him” not through other forces. You just say he’s a fucking idiot who forgot to ask) All of this only makes Erik more miserable of course. Still, it got him into the business and he became an agent in showbiz as a second job to make up for his losses on his operas. Your previous tolerance for his whining paid off when he offered to be your agent. He actually is a lot better at that naturally as he’s been able to extend your career past its long over due life expectancy.\n\nLately though he’s been as shitty of an agent as he is a musician, at least as far as you’re concerned.\n",

You started from nothing and pulled yourself up from nothing to become a star.\n\nYou just wish you’d invested your money better, and hadn’t gotten married and…well a whole bunch of things really.\n\nSometimes you think about transforming into a human and living like a normal person, but you were never one to pretend. You’re a monster and you’ll DIE a monster.\n\nBesides you’re more noticeable in your Wolf form even if you aren’t properly feared anymore. If you’re lucky you’ll get some human asking you for your autograph.\n\nAt least it’s something.\n\nIt doesn’t pay the bills on this humble cabin though. You need to make some money or you’ll be scrounging around in the forests like when you were a young pup. Not that you can’t survive, but you’re really accustomed to your “human comforts” now.\n\nDamn civilization has had a domesticating effect on you.\n\nBut you’re still the Alpha Wolf damn it.\n",
  "page 11": "The Visionary: Dr. Alphonse Moreau\n\nFuck Victor Frankenstein. That crackpot couldn’t compare to Moreau, and he knew it. Victor tried to “beat” Moreau in the Mad Scientist department and he failed spectacularly in everyway, and to add insult to injury, Moreau barely even acknowledged Victor’s self-created “feud” with him. Moreau was more interested in his own work more than competition. You never had any contact with Moreau mainly because he didn’t really take an interest in anything except his work.\n\nEveryone knows Moreau was doing a lot of genetic experimentation and crossbreeding with humans and animals. Everyone also knows that Moreau was attempting to create a utopia of sorts on his island. What surprised people, is he actually succeeded to an extent. When he realized initial attempts of inflicting punishment via “The House of Pain” were just making matters worse, he scraped that idea and tried a bunch of other ideas. He wasn’t really successful with any of them until the 60s came rolling on in…\n\nHe adopted some weird hippy/communist philosophy. You’re not really sure what it all entailed really since you never really were interested in such topics like government and philosophy, (Your simple “survival of the fittest” ideology seemed to work well for you) all you know is it entailed a lot of drugs and a lot of sex.\n\nBy the end of the 70s, Moreau’s Island had achieved what no human nation ever has. No violence. No crime. No hate. A Utopia. The “citizens” of the island from what you know just mate, eat, and sleep until they die of natural causes.\n\nWhile most would say that sounds like a paradise, you’d have to disagree. While the mating, eating, and sleeping all sound pretty good. Everyone there is a fucking VEGETARIAN! Even the citizens that were crossbred with carnivores such as lions, bears and (Shudder) wolves are all vegetarians, eating leaves right along side their herbivore counterparts peacefully. The thought of any predator mating with something they should normally be eating makes you ill.\n\nMaybe you’re old fashioned, but it just ain’t natural.\n",

Better to kill her now, than wake up one day and finding your cabin in the middle of another giant insect and human war. Besides you can kill her, rob the place, and make your escape, so this trip won’t be a total loss.\n\nPlus there’s the fact you need to prove to this bitch that you don’t care how big they are, all of them are still a bunch of lowly fucking bugs.\n\nJanice attempts to sting you, but you dodge and grab one of her mirrors. Your next move is throwing it in an attempt to decapitate her, she flies out of the way, but happily it hits a soldier ant in the head who was attempting to come in the doorway.\n\n“Filthy mammal! How dare you come here to try to kill me, don’t you know that you’re…”\n\nWhile she’s giving another speech, you grab her leg and slam her to the floor. Then you proceed to stomp on her back, crushing her wings. While she attempts to crawl away, you grab her stinger and pull it out; this is followed by a dying shriek as you’ve ripped the poison sack out which was attached to the rest of her insides. Your claws are covered with bug guts.\n\nA few more Ant soldiers come inside, but you use the stinger as a weapon and stab THEM in the chest with it squeezing the sac filling their bodies with deadly poison. They die convulsing horribly on the floor.\n\nBefore more can arrive you look through some of her drawers and find some money lying around, you take that and the diamond rings on her fingers. Before escaping out the window, you throw Andre’s letter at her corpse.\n\n“I believe I was supposed to deliver this to you.”\n\nYour escape is fortunately uneventful, but you lost your bike, so you have to walk home which sucks. Eventually you get back to your town where you stop at the bar to have a drink. You’re about to enjoy your drink, when that revolting odor hits you again.\n\n“Wolf! You’re back, so what happened? Did she like my letter?”\n“Eh, let’s just say she didn’t have any reaction to it…Andre I don’t think she’ll ever be interested.”\nAndre looks a bit saddened by the news.\n“Oh. I guess you were right.”\n“Here, here’s a c-note, knock yourself out on sugar.” You say giving him a hundred dollars.\n“Well thanks Wolf, see ya around.” Andre says cheering up almost immediately and running out of the bar.\n\nThe bartender speaks up about your uncharacteristic charity.\n\n“Wow, Wolf that was out of character for you.”\n“Yeah well keep the drinks coming, I’ll get back into character soon enough.”\n",

Just about everyone felt his wrath due to all this rejection and not being accepted as a “real monster”. He pulled a lot of cruel jokes on people as revenge, always got away with it too, since it’s difficult to find someone that’s invisible. (You did think it was funny when he stole some of Fagula’s best baby blood “wine” and mixed it with the blood of a diseased rat from his lab. He was sick for a month after ingesting such filth) He never tried anything on you though.\n\nIt might be because he seemed to take your rejection a little better. You at least acknowledged his existence, by telling him WHY you didn’t like him. Most others just tried to avoid the issue and avoid or ignore him just like…well an invisible man.\n\nBesides, his invisibility wouldn’t have affected you too much anyway; with your sense of smell, you could always sense him coming.\n",

  "page 15": "“I guess you always did know me pretty well Henry. Count me in.” you say.\n“Great! I knew you’d be game.”\n“Let’s get going, I’m ready.”\n\nYou, Henry and Jack enter his car and drive to some nondescript building. The ground floor resembles just a normal abandoned warehouse, but of course you three enter a secret room with an elevator that takes you to a lab area, then you pass through a gym area where you see quite a few ugly overly muscular humans doing some rigorous training while doing a lot of shouting and yelling A lot of them look like they have severe ‘roid rage and that includes the females.\n\n“Huh, sure they all look pretty, but can they fight?” you mockingly ask Henry.\n“Well that’s what we’re going to find out. Now the arena area is through that door, you can just enter and the testing will begin. Jack and I will be watching from an upper room. I’ll see you when you’re ready.”\n\nHenry leaves with the rest of the humans and you’re about to enter the arena, but a hand grabs you causing you pull away in a defensive stance. It’s Jack.\n\n“Don’t fucking touch me Jack!” you growl.\n“Sheesh, calm down there, I just have to tell you something. Something important.”\n“What Jack? I don’t have time for your shit.”\n“Yeah, well you’ll be thanking me later. You need to take this.” Jack takes a bottle out of his jacket and hands it to you.\n“What’s this?”\n“It’s MY invention. Henry hasn’t been telling you the entire truth. He’s setting you up to be killed. He doesn’t have any intention of letting you out that arena until one of his super soldiers kills you, and I guarantee it’ll happen eventually. He’s already got most of them hopped up to the point of being uncontrollable. He’ll probably start increasing the dosage if you start winning against the initial barrage. However if you drink my invention you’ll be able to survive. It’s just like what Henry’s been feeding his Super Soldiers, but without all the side effects. Surely you noticed how ugly and distorted all those subjects were. All he did was make alterations to his original Hyde formula instead creating something new from scratch like I did, yet he claims my invention isn’t good enough.”\n“This all smells like bullshit Jack, but assuming you’re telling the truth, why’s Henry doing it and why in this way?”\n“I dunno, because he’s a Mad Scientist, and prone to be dramatic I suppose, its just one of our endearing qualities. Plus we really are testing this shit for the government, so its still good research even if it’s doubling as murder. If you want deeper reasons the only other explanation I can give is he’s ALWAYS been jealous of you. Yes, it’s true he did admire you, but he was always jealous of your natural abilities which he had to get artificially, and even then it wasn’t entirely successful as you well know. I can personally vouch for having to hear him rag on you over the years.”\n\nThis all sounds pretty suspicious especially coming from Jack who’s known for his double dealing and sneaky ways. The bottle might contain poison for all you know, or maybe he’s just angry at Henry for snubbing his invention and he’s using you as a subject to test it which may or may not be as great as he says. Still, Mad Scientist types have tried to fuck you over before; you can’t help but wonder if Henry is planning what Jack’s claiming.\n",
  "page 9": "The Split Personality: Dr. Henry Jekyll/ Mr. Edward Hyde\n\nHenry Jekyll was a typical bookworm human nerd that couldn’t get a girl. If that all he was, you two wouldn’t have even met. Henry’s experiments though led him to the “Monster world”. Apparently he’d seen you and studied how successful you were with females of all types. He chalked it up to your confidence and overall badassitude.\n\n(Well he wasn’t really wrong in that assumption)\n\nUsing you as a model of what he wanted to be like, he started designing potions to duplicate the lycanthropy effect. Contrary to what most folks believe, Werewolves tend to breed with each other to make more, (as opposed to those unnatural parasitic Fagpires) they very rarely “make someone a werewolf”. It’s typically only by accident that that happens, and its VERY rare that someone survives long enough to escape a werewolf attack. Given all those risks and the very likelihood he would be killed in such a process Henry went ahead with his potions until one of them finally got the desired effect.\n\nThe problem was, it just made him into a big vicious ugly brute. (As opposed to a super smooth handsome Wolf like yourself) He wasn’t any more successful with the ladies as Mr. Hyde, if anything they were repulsed by him even more, which led a lot of…”accidents”. Ultimately he just broke down and paid for hookers. However, you and he hung out a lot back in the old days, mostly partying and fighting with others. He was a good guy to have your back in a fight when he was Mr. Hyde. You rarely talked to him as Henry, but he was usually civilized and respectful when he did address you. He didn’t annoy and piss you off like Erik, because he knew to keep his distance when he wasn’t your “peer”.\n\nYou can respect a (hu)man who knows his limitations.\n",

Henry might be an alright guy, but you really don’t trust Jack and you’ve had problems with Mad Scientists before. Maybe if you were younger you’d take the risk, but you’re a lot wiser now and you’re not about to set yourself up into going into a bad situation that you might not be able to get out of. You’re not scared, you’re just not stupid. You decide to decline and make up an excuse.\n\n“Well it does sound like fun, but unfortunately I’ve got a job from Erik recently that I need to see about tomorrow, so I’ll have to decline.”\n\nHenry looks very surprised at your answer; it was almost as if he thought you’d immediately take his offer. He attempts to convince you further, but you continue to decline which makes his voice and inflections sound more desperate with a hint of anger in them.\n\n“We were fucking friends Wolf! You’re going to leave me hanging like this?! Fucking ingrate! After all the fights I helped you in too!”\n”Henry, you better just fucking mind your tone. And half those fights I distinctly remember you starting and ME having to finish them!”\n“Why you fucking…” Henry stands up, which you do too daring him to do something, but naturally he realizes he isn’t in “Hyde” form, so he backs down. Jack eventually speaks up.\n“Come on Henry let’s go, we can get someone else.”\n\nJack hands Henry his coat who’s still giving you the hard stare. Just before they leave Henry has to get another word in.\n\n“Fucking yellow dog! You oughta be put out of your misery! The Wolf I knew would’ve jumped at this chance, I don’t know what happened, but you ain’t him! Fucking mongrel!”\n“Alright Henry shut the fuck up, before he kicks your ass EEEK!”\n\nJack gets out of the way when he sees you charge at Henry, he doesn’t stand a chance in his human form and you beat the hell of him.\n\nAs he lies on the ground bleeding and pondering his poor choice of words, you relay a question to him.\n\n“Is that more like the Wolf who you USED to know? And Jack get your invisible ass outta here, before I tear you a new one too! I’m not falling for whatever fucked up scheme you had planned for me!”\n\nJack quickly drags Henry out as quickly as possible, while you go back to drinking.\n\nAfter drinking your drink, you head back home and decide to call Erik up tomorrow who’ll hopefully be less annoying and actually have a job for you. Turns out he does and you end up having to show up at a comic convention as a special guest. It’s not exactly exciting for you, but then at least you don’t have to get your head bashed in to get paid.\n\n“Oooo! Ooo! Mr. Wolf! In Lycanthrope Terror #6, were you supposed to be immune to the silver dagger because you had sex with the witch who granted you extra powers in the beginning, or was it because you had been sent directly from Hell and thus had demon blood in your veins giving you extra powers? Because their problems with both of those things, because if…”\n\nThe nerdy human goes on for another 10 minutes pointing out plot holes when in actuality there isn’t one, since the fucking dagger wasn’t silver at all it was just really shiny steel, and if he’d paid as much attention to movie then he did his own whiney voice he’d know that.\n\nCome to think of it, maybe getting your head bashed in might be preferable.\n",
  "page 90": "Giant Ants: THEM!\n\nWell thanks to human ingenuity they probably created more monsters in the 50s with their nuclear tests. Gigantism and mutation were a big problem during that era. Along with giant spiders and mantises, the biggest problem was when an ant colony was struck by massive radiation and went undetected in the desert for a couple of years and wasn’t discovered until giant ants began carrying off small children from nearby towns to their colony.\n\nGranted they were never as big as people saw in the movies (Such a size would cause them to collapse underneath their own weight) but they did grow to be as big as humans. In fact they took on the look of “Ant centaurs”. A torso with two arms and a back end with four legs, still all very antlike though. Initially they weren’t very intelligent, but they grew smarter as time went on. This caused even greater problems for humans later.\n\nNow the “Ant people” weren’t malevolent per say, but they just had a different outlook on life just like any other culture, and they saw humans (And anything else that went near their colony) as a source of food. Naturally humans and insects have never gotten along so it was only a matter of time before all out war was declared. The war might’ve lasted longer if the Ant people were able to adapt a little better, and if humans hadn’t had a severe tech advantage. The humans were determined to wipe THEM out before they could get the numerical advantage. This of course was done by blowing up their queen thus ending any chance of THEM ever conquering the Earth. The remaining Ant people would’ve probably been mopped up, but by this time it was the 60s and civil rights and shit came about. Hippies started saying that they had the right to exist on their own land and such, so the remaining ones were eventually allowed to live, and in time they assimilated into society like everyone else. Nobody was sure of their life span, but the government still perceived THEM as a legitimate potential threat and didn’t really want to take the chance that one of those ants could turn into another queen somehow, so a lot got drafted into the Vietnam War to “thin out” their population. (Plus they made excellent soldiers, and were especially helpful in flushing out Viet Cong tunnels)\n\nNeedless to say there aren’t too many Ant People left anymore, the ones that are still alive tend to keep to themselves and suspicious of everyone and anyone that doesn’t have six limbs.\n\nAny chance of THEM making a “come back” is highly unlikely.\n",
  "page 93": "“I don’t think so; I want to make sure this gets to her, so you can just let me in.”\n“Well then you can shove that letter up your ass and pull it back out and give it to Andre to eat, because you ain’t getting in here mutt. We’ll not let your inferior kind pollute the Hive. Leave, you’re not wanted here.”\n\nIt’s obvious that they don’t know anything about you, because they’d know that anyone telling you that you’re not wanted somewhere is the surest way of causing you to get in on purpose out of sheer spite.\n\n“Well I guess I’ll just…” you stop talking and grab the guard’s big ant head through the bars of the gate and smash it towards you causing green stuff to leak out. You then retreat back to you bike when the rest open up the gate to punish you. The fools now have the gate open! While they attempt to catch you, you maneuver your bike around THEM to avoid their attacks and drive towards the mansion.\n\nA general alarm is raised and soon there are ants all over the estate attempting to catch you. You’d never be able to fight them all. As you get closer to the mansion you notice its several entrances. You can either drive your bike into one of these hive tunnels or just drive your bike through one of the low mansion windows.\n",
  "page 92": "You hand the guard the letter through the gate, who goes scuttling off to the mansion. The previous ant guard you were arguing with keeps watch on you, while the others go about their normal marching drills.\n\nSoon the other guard returns.\n\n“The Queen says while she’s flattered by such words, she has no interest in Andre and never has. She also says she hopes that this will finally put an end to his obsessive stalking. Goodbye mammal, you have no further business here.”\n\nWell that was certainly abrupt. You get back on your bike and return home. You can’t help but think the guard probably just ripped up the letter, but there’s not much you can do about it now. You tell Andre what happened, and he seems crushed, but you don’t really give a damn, since you basically wasted your time and didn’t get anything out of this. You tell Andre to never bother you again or you’ll shove a bug zapper up his ass.\n\nYou return home pissed off and give Erik another call. You end up having to take a job as a special guest at a comic convention where you have to endure the inane rambling of hundreds of nerdy humans, which results in you being arrested after you maul a couple of them due to your short tolerance level.\n",
  "page 94": "Maybe you’re getting a little soft in your old age, but you can somewhat sympathize with Andre, he’s in an even worse situation than you. He’s been stricken by bad luck more than you have. Helping him could be financially beneficial, plus if Andre had a home, he wouldn’t be constantly bothering you for money every time you walked into town.\n\n“Alright Andre I’ll help, just stand back and get your fucking disease ridden hands off of me! And don’t touch me again!”\n“Okay, I can do that. Thanks Wolf! I swear I won’t forget this!”\n“Yeah, yeah, now what do you want me to do?”\n“I need you to deliver this letter to her; it’s a poem about how I feel about her and how I’ve always felt about her. I know if she just read this she’d give me a chance!”\n\nYou take the crumpled letter which reeks of Andre’s overall foulness, but you still have more questions.\n\n“Andre I know you’ve always wanted to do some buggery on Janice, but I hardly see how this is going to change how she feels and why the hell can’t you do this?”\n“Because every time I even try to get NEAR her mansion she has her guards chase me off! Its like when I try to sneak in anywhere people can somehow sense I’m coming!”\n“Andre, did it ever occur to you to that your fucking ODOR is the reason?”\n“Odor? What odor?” Andre asks like it’s the first time anyone’s ever suggested that to him that before. “Look I know in my heart that if she read my words, she’d fall for me, just like I know you’ll be able to get in and give her that letter!”\n“This is starting to sound like a lot of effort for possibly no reward…”\n“Arrrgh! Look when you get in there, you could always just rip something valuable off! Just please, you gotta give her that letter!”\n\nYou look at the love letter (which has remarkable penmanship) and shake your head. Looks like you’re on a bug hunt.\n\n“Alright Andre you’re lucky her mansion isn’t far and I’m not busy right now. I just turned down an offer to live on an island paradise for the rest of my life in exchange for getting rid some Martians.”\n“What, you mean Moreau’s offer? He offered me a similar deal, but then quickly retracted it for some reason. But Wolf I know you wouldn’t have wanted to help some hippy freaks you don’t even know! But this is different! In this case you’re helping out an old friend gain true love!”\n“Okay listen up, I’m not, nor will I ever be your friend. I’m doing this for my own reasons. When I return, meet me back here at this bar.”\n\nYou turn and eagerly leave Andre to go back to your cabin. You don’t normally like to wash, but in this case you definitely feel the need to! After thoroughly scrubbing down, you take your Harley and drive over to Janice’s mansion which is just a couple of counties away. It doesn’t take you long to get there.\n\nYou haven’t really seen this place except once a long time ago and it looked like a regular mansion, now the place looks like a concentration compound; there is a big metal gate and barbed wire lined walls surrounding the mansion. The mansion itself looks like some half weird insect hive, half man made structure. As soon as you park near the gate you’re approached by some figures marching in unison like soldiers. They’re like big ants or at least they look like THEM. Something weird is going on.\n\n“You! Inferior hairy mammal! What business do you have here at the Hive?!” one of the ant guards asks clicking his mandibles angrily.\n“I’m supposed to deliver a letter to Janice.”\n“Watch you tongue, dog! You mean the Supreme Hive Queen! And she does not see inferiors such as you! Be gone, you impotent mangy mutt!”\n\nWell you’re used to people not liking you, but hearing it from a giant bug is still pretty insulting.\n",
  "page 97": "You figure Janice will be in the hive tunnels given that she’s a “queen” now. You’re still wondering what the fuck is exactly going on here.\n\nSadly you won’t be finding out. As you drive deeper through the hive tunnels it gets very apparent that you’re lost due to the fact they all look alike! The ant guards have no such directional difficulties and are all over the place. Soon they manage to knock you off the bike, you make a run for it, but its no use there are too many and you’re completely lost.\n\nThey catch you, overwhelm you, kill you and eat you.\n\nYes, in that exact order. (It would be silly in any other order)\n",
  "page 96": "You’re not about to get yourself lost in some insect tunnels, besides knowing that stuck up wasp bitch, she’d still live in her mansion area. You drive up on a raised part of the ground and jump your bike through one of the first floor windows. The glass breaks and several house ants get out of your way except one who you land on and crush. You fly off your bike “Shit!” you exclaim as you slam into the wall.\n\nYou quickly recover and find yourself surrounded by more ant people. These ants aren’t as big as the ones outside, but that hardly matters. They seem a little more shocked than anything though.\n\n“Eeek! There’s a filthy mammal in the Hive! Protect the queen! Protect the queen! Where are the soldiers?!” one yells and then they all let off an ear piecing sound\n\nSpeaking of the soldiers, they’re heading towards the broken window you just crashed through, you need to get to Janice NOW. You punch your way through the house ants. In the ensuing scuffle you rip off a couple of antennas, this seems to have a desired incapacitating effect on THEM and they begin twitching on the floor.\n\n“Oh yeah, I forgot that they need those things.” You say as you run up an ornate staircase with a fistful of antennas in your hand.\n\nYou go through fancy room through fancy room (Mostly filled with expensive items, lots of sugar and some strange looking symbols) looking for Janice, until you finally reach a large bedroom with several mirrors. A bipedal insect creature stares into one of the mirrors brushing her hair. She turns around and a low angry buzz is sounded when she sees you. She flaps her wings and flies towards you.\n\n“AN INFERIOR MAMMAL IN MY HIVE? YOUR KIND WILL SOON BE ERADICATED FROM THE EARTH! INSECTS SHALL RULE ONCE AGAIN! THE TRUE MASTER RACE!” she shouts.\n\nYou’re not exactly surprised that she doesn’t want to see you.\n",
  "page 150": "Eh, you let it slide this once, Mary can’t really help being so ignorant of a Werewolf’s pride, she’s just a fucking patchwork of corpse parts, besides you need the money from this job, and who knows, maybe you can jump start your career again…\n\nBut there’s still no way you’re going to play in this movie the way it is! Time to turn on that charm.\n\n“Mary, look I know you mean well and all, but come on, you can’t seriously expect me to play this character! It’s insulting! Make it a comedy if you must, but make a dark one at least, not some family shit. Maybe I’m some fucking relic of the past trying to hold on to days gone by, but just about all I got left in this shitty world is my balls and my pride and I’m not losing either of them!”\n\nMary stares at you a bit, then she addresses the wolfings.\n\n“Alright you guys that’s a wrap for today! I’ll call you back when I need you, there’s going to be some script rewrites, and before someone bites my head off, don’t worry nobody’s lost their jobs.”\n\nAfter the set is completely clear, Mary addresses you and strokes your facial fur.\n\n“That was a very passionate little speech you just gave, and almost halfway civilized for you. I especially liked the part about your balls.” At this point she gently caresses the twins with her other hand. “Mmm yes, I don’t think I’d like you to lose those either, or THIS!”\n\nAt this point Mary grabs your big fully erect dick.\n\n“How about you and I discuss those script changes now, Wolfie?”\n“Alright, but its going to be hard for you to talk with your mouth full…”\n\nFour hours later, you and Mary have expended your sexual energy and are in a more talkative mood.\n\n“…and that’s how I think the movie should go.” You finish explaining.\n“Actually that’s not a bad idea; I’ll certainly incorporate some of the changes you suggested. See, and that’s why you’ll always hold a place in my heart, Wolfie.” Mary says lying next to you.\n“Well, the patchwork heart that was given to you anyways Mary.”\n“Damn Wolf, you were doing so well there for awhile and you revert right back to asshole mode.”\n“It’s a gift.”\n“Hmm, it’s also why you’re all alone.”\n“So what? I’ve always been a loner.”\n“And you’re happy living like that?”\n“Its worked pretty well so far, don’t see any reason to change now.”\n“Oh come on, surely you’d like someone around as opposed to the fast ass girls I hear you still bed every now and then.”\n“What? You mean like a wife? Yeah right! Tried that remember, you were part of the reason why I ultimately got divorced…ah fuck it. I was having problems with that bitch and fucking around on her before we started seeing each other. Nobody’s fault except my own for being stupid enough for getting married in the first place.”\n“Well maybe you just made the wrong choice in woman…”\n“No, I didn’t. I made the wrong choice period. I wasn’t meant to be married, and it’s not the idea of just fucking one female forever, I just value my freedom too much.”\n“Well I don’t see how you can be happy without someone special in your life.”\n“Jesus fuckin’ Christ, Mary what is with you getting all into my fucking business? What about you? You ain’t married and you seem to be doing alright! …Or are you trying to tell me something?”\n\nMary looks at you with a solemn expression on her face and touches your hand.\n\n“Wolf, things are different for me now. I spent years searching and while I’ve had lots of exciting and pleasant experiences in my life, but I’ve never felt as close to someone as I have during our time together. I might be made up of parts, but I’ve always felt a piece was missing when I wasn’t with you. No matter where I was, you were always in my mind.”\n“Oh so that’s what this is huh? You’re feeling that something is missing in your existence so you figure you can just waltz back into ol’ Wolf’s life because hey he doesn’t have anything going on and pick back up where we left off? Fuck that, I can say you literally and figuratively screwed the pooch on that one, baby. You ended up running off with that half a fag Dracula while I was getting all my shit taken away from me by my bitch ex-wife and sued by your goddamn no talent father!” you say and move your hand away.\n“It was a confusing time for me Wolf! You know how I was, I had all these hormones injected into me and I was initially created for the sole purpose of being a sex toy! Yes, I managed to overcome, but I couldn’t fight all of my initial feelings, I was also so curious about everything and anything! Dracula was a well traveled person and yes he WAS charming, I learned a lot while I was with him. I saw the world and more. You think I wanted to leave you? I loved you! Yes and I know you find that hard to believe that something Undead is capable of love, but I LOVED you!”\n“Oh yeah, well if you loved me so fucking much, why the fuck did you leave?”\n“Because I had to! You were stuck in your own little world, never wanting to mix with anyone, never wanting to do anything that didn’t interest you, I’m a social being! I need to be around people. I don’t know, maybe its because I was originally made to just stay locked in that fucking castle for that sicko Frankie and I spent so much time alone that I never wanted to be alone again. If stayed with you EVEN after your divorce and mine, I would’ve been trading a neglective mate, for an overly possessive one. Come on Wolf I know you. You would’ve been alienating everyone who looked at me with a hint of attraction. I had to let you go so I could be independent and find myself.”\n“Yeah, yeah, you’re the fucking victim as always right Mary? Tell someone who gives a shit. Fuck this, I’m not working on this movie with you, I don’t care what rewrites you do. I’m out.”\n\nYou storm off, but as always Mary gets the last word.\n\n“I can’t be a victim, because you’ve already taken that job! You carry a chip on your shoulder the size of Gibraltar and act like the goddamn World owes you something, well it doesn’t! You can’t let shit go! It’s why you’re all by yourself! Okay Wolf, fuck me then, I was no good fucking cheating bitch that did you wrong. Fine. You talk to any of your children lately? At least the ones you know about? You got fucking sons and daughters Wolf and you’ve alienated ALL of them with your inflexibility and assholiness! Even Lawrence, who you once were so proud of remember? He was following in your footsteps remember? But what happened? He disappointed you by following his heart instead of YOUR bigotry!”\n\nThe name “Lawrence” is one you haven’t heard in a long time and one you hoped you’d never hear again. You have to stop yourself from seriously damaging Mary for even mentioning him. Instead you just slowly turn around and attempt to calm yourself.\n\n“Mary, you will NOT fucking utter that name again. He’s fucking dead to me. You got that? He’s as fucking dead as your fucking flesh! He’s not a son, he’s not a relative, he’s not a friend!”\n“Yeah, I knew you’d say something like that, I told LAWRENCE that when we talked the last time and it’s so sad because he’s always just wanted your approval.”\n\nWhat the hell? What is Mary doing talking to your fucking no good disappointment of a son who dishonored the family by marrying Irena…one of the Cat People.\n",
  "page 152": "“I warned you about saying that name again!” you say and back hand Mary across the face, if she was human, she’d have a nice red welt there now and be on the floor, but Mary’s made of stronger stuff, in fact she starts hitting you back, which you attempt to deflect.\n\n“YOU BASTARD! How fucking dare you! Get the fuck out, I was an idiot thinking I could get you to change! You can forget about being in the movie too! Go back to your shithole cabin and be fucking alone since that’s what you want so bad!”\n“Yeah, yeah. Fuck you too.” You say turning around to leave while taking a few punches to your back.\n\nYou return to your cabin and brood in the darkness, muttering to yourself.\n\n“I don’t need them; I don’t need any of them. I don’t need anybody. Never did. I’m not a pussy ass whiney weakling. I’m the fucking Alpha Wolf. That’s why I’m still here and everyone else is gone or fallen by the wayside. I got my fuckin’ pride. That’s all I need…that’s all I’ll ever need…” you say falling asleep.\n",
  "page 151": "Your interest is overriding your loathing; you decide to question Mary further.\n\n“What the fuck are you doing talking to Lawrence?”\n“It’s not like he’s a complete stranger to me you know, we did meet several times on the set when you and I were seeing each other. We got along remember?”\n“Yeah, I remember, so what, were you fucking him too at the time?”\n“(Sigh) No Wolf, though I wouldn’t have minded that since he was less of an asshole and a more open minded sort than you! In fact had he not been so in love with Irena, I might’ve tried, but I saw theirs was a true love and I wasn’t going to break that up…”\n“Hold just a goddamn minute! He told YOU about Irena before me?! You were keeping secrets from me?!”\n“No! In fact I was the one who told him to tell you about Irena because I knew you’d find out eventually, though he should’ve picked a better time than in the middle of your divorce to do it. I didn’t tell you because it wasn’t my place and it was between you and him. He wanted to keep it secret since he was so afraid that you’d be disappointed in him…”\n”Hah! Disappointment isn’t a strong enough word!”\n“Yeah, I guess that was a mistake on my part. I figured you’d be able to look past it and I told him you would because he was your son and you were so proud of him…huh. I see your mind hasn’t changed on the subject though.”\n“Never will either, now that was fucking years ago what the hell are you doing still talking to him?”\n“Wolf, just because I wasn’t with you, doesn’t mean I couldn’t talk to Lawrence! Maybe by staying in contact with him, I felt like I was still in contact with you. Goddammit Wolf, I’m a free woman, I can talk to who I want! Besides, you disowned him anyway, what do you care?! I always kept in contact with Lawrence AND Irena. I even see them both every now and then…I bet I know more about Lawrence now than you do…hell I bet you don’t even know they have children! You got MORE grandchildren you don’t even know about!”\n\nYou stand in utter shock; you didn’t even know such a pairing would produce off spring. You didn’t really want to think about it really.\n\n“He’s got children?” you say dumbfounded.\n“Yeah a few of them, they’re a bit funny looking, but they’re very cute! (Sigh) I always wished I was able to have children…” Mary says wistfully. “You know Wolf you really should see Lawrence. It would mean so much to him.”\n\nYou don’t know, maybe all this information has bewildered you a bit, maybe Mary laid down the lovin’ really good, maybe you’re getting soft in your old age or maybe, just MAYBE you do want to see Lawrence.\n\n“…Alright…alright Mary, I’ll go see him, but I’m not promising anything!”\n\nMary smiles and hugs you.\n\n“You will?”\n“Yeah, but if his cat bitch starts anything, I’m outta there!”\n“Oh Irena’s nice! You should get to know her too! She isn’t at all like you think Cat People are! I’ll go get ready!”\n“What?! You’re coming too?”\n“Of course, someone’s gotta keep you on a leash so you don’t end up destroying something, besides I know where they live and you don’t, so I’m going with you.”\n\nSoon you and Mary get on your Harley and are on your way. Mary tells you how to get your son’s house. You didn’t even realize he lived in the same state. You park your bike outside a fairly nice looking house. Your son’s been doing something right.\n\nYou take a deep breath when you get to the door and stand there for a few seconds preparing yourself, and then ring the bell.\n\nThe door opens almost immediately and a feline face stands before you, this must be Irena. It’s obvious she recognizes you, but predictably she doesn’t look happy to see you.\n\n“You? What do you want?” she demands, while Mary looks at you a little concerned about what you’re going to say.\n",
  "page 154": "The Cat People: Irena Reed\n\nTo be quite honest you don’t know a whole hell of a lot about your son’s wife Irena, and you don’t really want to. All you know is she’s a fucking cat person and that’s enough to disown him by association.\n\nWhile you’re openly vocal about your extreme dislike for the undead and vampires in particular, you’d grudgingly admit while under duress and in a hopeless state of drunkenness, you have met a few that you’ve been able to get along with. Hell you’ve been known to fuck the occasional Vamp chick every now and then (Not to mention Mary). Not being natural creatures, you don’t really expect anything better from them, so whatever sneaky arrogant shit they pull doesn’t really surprised you.\n\nHowever, there is ONE group of people you absolutely WILL NOT tolerate on any level, and those are those damn Cat People. You just can’t stand the scent of them. They’re a decadent perverted race that sickens you. The Cat People are lycanthrope predators much like Werewolves, but that’s where the similarities end, and they aren’t even good predators anymore. Werewolves favor a survivalistic mindset. Even the young pups today who you normally frown upon as being spoiled go around trying to hone their skills and maintain that fighting spirit. Cat People do no such thing. They sponge, scam, scavenge and are just outright lazy bastards, even those overgrown leeches you call Vampires are less of a drain on society in your opinion.\n\nIt’s partly why you’re such a hard ass when it comes to the “old ways’ and harass young werewolves about not living up to them like they should. Because you see that Cat People USED to be like Werewolves but then they completely gave into civilization and allowed themselves to become soft, fat and weak, and as long as you draw breathe on this shitty World you will NOT allow the Werewolf race to follow in their paw prints. Cat People are a hated reminder of what “civilization” can do to anyone if they aren’t careful.\n\nAnother unsavory characteristic that they have that repulses you is that they’ve been rumored to indulge in incest; a loathsome practice that only serves to destroy and weaken a gene line, all of which gives further reason why they have fallen so far from what they used to be.\n\nNot to mention fucking lazy. You mean sheesh, they can’t even be bothered to look for a mate outside their goddamn house?\n",
  "page 153": "The Wolfman: Lawrence Talbot\n\nOne of your halfbreed sons by a human woman, however as long as the father is a werewolf then the child is still considered a werewolf. (Yes Werewolf society is patriarchal) Besides any seed of yours can’t be anything else BUT a werewolf!\n\nAt least that’s what you’ve always believed, until Lawrence. Its true some of your other sons and daughters have disappointed you in some way for your strict ideology of how a “True Werewolf” is supposed to act, but Lawrence stepped over a line that can’t be dismissed as simple weakness, if anything its treason at worst and perverted mental illness at best, especially since you had such high hopes for him.\n\nWhen Lawrence was a cub, he did everything he could to emulate you. You weren’t in his life growing up of course since you’d long moved on before you even knew he was born, but he did everything he could to learn about you and eventually seek you out when he grew up. You remember he first arrived on one of the sets he punched out two security guards who tried to escort him off. You knew then he was one of yours. He was very excited to finally meet you and for your part you liked him too. Here he was, wanting to model his life after yours, as opposed to complaining and whining about how you weren’t there for him. Truly the survival instinct mindset was strong in this one. You spent time with him when you could. Indeed you wanted to. He didn’t ask for hand outs either, he wanted to prove he could do everything himself. And when his first movie opened up to glowing reviews, you were bursting with pride.\n\nIt looked like everything was going good; Lawrence might’ve eventually replaced you as the “Alpha Wolf” which you didn’t even mind. He was worthy. You had the idea of him having cubs of his own and how one of them would also replace him when he got too old. It would’ve been a good legacy to be proud of…but then love got in the way.\n\nYou don’t even like thinking about that dark day. The day he met that cat THING! Needless to say everything fell apart; it was also around the time of your divorce so you were really in no mood to hear his pleas for you to “understand”. You disowned him immediately. He wasn’t even a fucking werewolf anymore as far as you were concerned; you didn’t even dirty your hands beating the shit out of him since he disgusted you so much. Eventually he faded out of sight in the movie industry, disheartened by your harsh and brutal decision, but continued his abominable relationship with that cat thing.\n\nYears later you were invited to the wedding, but you returned it to sender with the words “PUSSY WHIPPED” in big red letters on the front.\n",
  "page 134": "You have no idea why the hell Joe hasn’t just gotten some heavy duty weed killer. You tell Joe you’ll be back and zoom off to the nearest hardware store, where you buy a big tank of the stuff with what little money you have.\n\nWhen you come back you head straight to the backyard where the Triffids sense new fertilizer and begin to slowly scuttle towards you. You put on a mask and begin to spray the area. The toxic gas does its work and the Triffids begin to die, along with every other plant in the backyard, you’ve just destroyed Joe’s garden!\n\nJust then, Joe comes out to see why there’s a toxic cloud in his yard and is horrified by what you’ve done.\n\n“MY GARDEN! WHAT DID YOU DO!?!” Joe cries.\n“I killed the Triffids just like you wanted.”\n“YOU KILLED MY GARDEN! You fucking idiot! Why the hell did you use poison?! You were supposed to rip them out by hand!”\n“Oh so it was okay for me to get stung right? Fuck that, you never said how I was supposed to kill them.”\n“It should’ve been obvious not to use poison you goddamn moron!”\n”Well shit, I’m not a botanist, how the fuck was I supposed to know.”\n“Oh God! My business is ruined! I’m finished! (Sob!)”\n“Yeah, um, sorry about that. Look I’m just going to leave now…okay then.”\n\nYou leave Joe to his tears and ride back home. You then walk back to where Kong is.\n\n“Okay I think you can stay at Joe’s, he’s got a cave in his backyard, you can take up residence in, it’s better than nothing.”\n“I suppose so; I just hope he doesn’t pitch a bitch at me if I accidentally step on a couple of his faggot ass flowers.”\n“I don’t think you’ll ever have to be worrying about that Kong.”\n",
  "page 29": "As soon as you open up the panel, you feel a boot to the head. This wouldn’t be able to stop you, but the pistol with silver bullets does. After kicking you in the head, Jack unloads six silvers into your head killing you instantly before your body drops down the elevator shaft, hitting Mr. Hyde and then bouncing off him and continuing to fall until it crashes to the bottom.\n",
  "page 133": "You figure Joe wants his garden still intact hence the reason he never used toxic chemicals, you prepare yourself for battle and enter the backyard which is littered here and there with dead human workers. The Triffids instantly sense you and begin to crawl slowly over towards you.\n\nFighting them isn’t really that hard, Joe probably kept getting stung due to the fact that he’s a larger target and isn’t as fast as you. You easily avoid their stingers and carefully avoid getting surrounded as you turn them into Caesar salad. Soon you’re finished! You knock on the back door and Joe answers.\n\n“All finished Joe.”\n“What already? Wow, you’re efficient! Maybe you should stick around to help me on a regular basis.”\n“Don’t think so, but nice try. So Kong can stay then?”\n“Of course, I keep my word, (Sigh) I’m going to have to hire all new workers though, I’m really going to take a loss this year.”\n\nYou turn briefly around and see someone coming out of the cave.\n\n“Hey Joe, looks like you won’t have to hire all new workers, there’s one coming out of the cave, guess some of them were hiding in there huh?”\n\nJoe looks over and another one comes out, then another.\n\n“That’s weird…I thought he was…now wait I know he’s…I saw!”\n“What? What’s going on?” You ask.\n“I saw those workers die! I saw the damn Triffids kill them right before my eyes! How can they be over there alive!?”\n\nAt first you think zombies, but that can’t be it. Then you notice one of the dead bodies looks very similar to one of the ones coming out of the caves, and that’s when you know what you’re dealing with.\n\n“Uh Joe, you got something worse than just a Triffid infestation, you got fucking Body Snatchers! Fucking Pod People man!” you exclaim.\n\nAt this point a bunch of them have just come out of the cave and they all look in your direction and let out an ear piecing screech while pointing at you.\n\n“Oh no! Wolf can you kill them too?” Joe asks as they advance.\n",
  "page 135": "Killer Plants: Triffids\n\nThere isn’t much to know about Triffids, they’re basically intelligent plants that like to kill people with their stingers and then use them for fertilizer. There have been questions if they came from spores from a crashed meteor or if they were yet another genetic experiment gone wrong. Given your past dealings with Mad Scientist types and humans in general, you’d say the latter.\n\nFucking humans never know when to leave shit alone.\n",
  "page 138": "“Hey look, there’s a lot of them and I just expended energy fighting a bunch of Triffids! This is your business at stake here. Hell you’re two times bigger than me, the least you can do is help!”\n“Erm…well…okay, I guess you’re right. I just don’t like violence, I’m a lover not a fighter.” Joe says.\n\nYou both walk towards them and get into it. You clobber a couple of them, and think this\nis going to be an easy fight, that is until one of them starts talking about the intricacies of insurance forms, then another talks about the topic of button collecting and the details about it. Yet another discusses the fascinating subject of the history of chamber pot making…\n\nYou’ve never been overwhelmed by such mind-numbing matter! Your energy begins to leave you and your lids begin to get heavy. Fortunately Joe is there to help you from falling asleep.\n\n“Wake up Wolf! Don’t listen to them!” he shouts while punches out three of them at the same time.\n“Huh? Yeah!” you say getting yourself back into the fight.\n\nEventually you both pound all the pod people back into mulch.\n\n“Man, what a boring fight.” You say.\n“I’m just glad its over, I think I ruined my manicure, I’ll have to make an appointment to get another one.”\n“Yeah anyway, that should be the end of your plant problems now. You’re not a bad fighter, for someone who claims to be a lover. I’ll just tell Kong he can come over.”\n“Hold on Wolf, you did help a lot, I didn’t even know about the Body Snatcher hiding in the cave. Good thing you were here, before they got too powerful. Here’s some money for your help.”\n“Hey, thanks Joe. Glad this hasn’t been for nothing.”\n\nYou leave Joe to his clean up and ride back home. You then walk back to where Kong is.\n\n“Okay I think you can stay at Joe’s, he’s got a cave in his backyard, you can take up residence in, it’s better than nothing.”\n“I suppose so; I just hope he doesn’t pitch a bitch at me if I accidentally step on a couple of his faggot ass flowers.”\n“Hey, if you know what’s good for you, you won’t be talking like that around him or else you’ll be getting kicked out again.” You remind Kong.\n“Yeah, yeah, I know, well thanks for helping me out. I almost didn’t think you would when I first asked you.”\n“What can I say; it’s been that kind of day for me…and it won’t be again for a long ass time if I have anything to do about it.”\n",
  "page 137": "“What?! Oh for fuck’s sake, alright you big pussy.” You say and walk towards them while Joe hides in his house.\n\nYou clobber a couple of them, and think this is going to be an easy fight, that is until one of them starts talking about the intricacies of tax forms, then another talks about the topic of lint collecting and the details about it. Yet another discusses the fascinating subject of the history of cabinet making…\n\nYou’ve never been overwhelmed by such mind-numbing matter! Your energy begins to leave you and your lids begin to get heavy. You fall into a deep slumber which you never wake up from. Soon a doppelganger of you is hatched.\n\nThe Boring Snatchers have claimed another victim.\n",
  "page 139": "The Pod People: Body Snatchers\n\nOut of all the Alien races you’ve come across, or ANY race you’ve come across for that matter, the Body Snatchers have to be without a doubt the most BORING bunch of beings you’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting. They have no emotions whatsoever and talk in a monotone voice. They are not fun in any sense of the word and worse they want to turn everyone else like them as well. They’re like intergalactic religious missionaries, but even more boring if such a thing was possible. You can’t imagine what their home planet is like; it must be filled with bureaucrats, accountants and insurance agents.\n\nIt’s not even any fun fighting them. They just fall down and die when you kill them. No screams, no yelling, nothing. At most they might say “Ow.” and keel over.\n",
  "page 21": "Even with your renewed “youth”, you know you’re not going to be able to take Mr. Hyde, not head on at least. You still need to get the hell out of here though and he’s blocking the only exit, but you have a plan. Mr. Hyde predictably charges at you, and puts his giant fist through the wall behind you, collapsing most of it when you dodge out of the way.\n\nWell there was your plan! When he unsuccessfully tries to hit you again, you roll out of the way and run out the opening Mr. Hyde just provided for you. You quickly take a few bricks and chuck them at Mr. Hyde’s face when he attempts to squeeze through, of course that doesn’t do anything except causing a few gashes and making him madder.\n\n“YOU DIE TODAY WOLF!” he says collapsing more of the building in an attempt to get you. You just realized you’re underground, if he continues with this destruction he’s going to end up burying the both of you. You make your way to the elevator with Mr. Hyde in pursuit.\n\nWhen you get to where the elevator is in sight, you see Jack with a briefcase, busily fiddling with the buttons, he turns to face you.\n\n“Wolf! Watch out behind you!” he yells pointing in your direction.\n",
  "page 24": "You lower your head and make a sprint to the elevator which opens up just as you leap into it. Jack moves out of your way when you do this and then follows you into the elevator.\n\n“Wow Wolf, you just missed getting nailed in the head.” Jack says pressing the button up. He might be invisible, but you can tell by the movement of his clothing that he’s fidgeting a lot. The building is shaking, not to mention the elevator, from Mr. Hyde’s destructive rampage, you seriously hope it makes it to the top.\n\nAs the elevator ascends upward, you both can hear Mr. Hyde below bashing the elevator door open.\n\n“YOU WON’T ESCAPE ME WOLF!” you can hear him yell. He’s definitely in the shaft at this point, you can hear scraping and the twisting of metal. It sounds like he’s climbing after you through the shaft, not the emergency ladder!\n\nSuddenly the elevator creaks to a halt. Jack frantically presses the buttons, but nothing works.\n\n“NO! Shit! No! This can’t be happening! He must’ve knocked some sort of power out some how! Wolf there’s a service panel up top, open it up and we’ll escape out that way.”\n",
  "page 23": "You don’t think you just act and dive face first in the floor and roll attempting to avoid whatever Mr. Hyde has just thrown at you. The only problem is, he didn’t throw anything; in fact he’s still trying to squeeze through the corridor that’s just a bit too small for him. Meanwhile you were rolling on the floor; Jack nipped inside the elevator and closed the door!\n\n“SONOFABITCH!” You shout and quickly pry the doors open with all your might, but the elevator is already on its way up. Fortunately there is an emergency ladder on the side you can still use, or if you want to risk it the elevator has only just started to ascend, you could grab on to the bottom of it and take it up.\n",
  "page 26": "You start climbing the ladder as quickly as you can, its not quick enough though. Hyde eventually bashes the elevator doors open and squeezes into the shaft, upon seeing you on the ladder he climbs up the shaft by digging his massive fingers into the walls. He climbs high enough to grab you off the ladder and squeeze the life out of you until you explode into a mass of blood like a bloated tick.\n",
  "page 25": "You jump up and grab the bottom as the elevator doors snap shut behind you. You hold on for dear life as you hear the building shake from Hyde destroying yet another load bearing pillar no doubt. The elevator is shaking as well which does concern you since if it suddenly starts to drop, you’re going to be in a BAD position! As you dangle high above, you look down and see the elevator doors you came through being smashed through. Hyde sticks his head in first, then his massive body, and looks up, he sees you.\n\n“DIE WOLF!”\n\nHis single mindedness on your death causes him to start digging his massive fingers in the shaft walls to climb after you! To make matters worse the elevator has just stopped, you hear Jack cursing above you. As you look up you notice a service panel on the bottom of the elevator. You could either open and go through that, or attempt to leap to the emergency ladder.\n",
  "page 28": "You leap for the ladder and just barely make it from your awkward position. Hyde is still in pursuit and closing fast. When you start your ascent, the see the figure of Jack jumping on the ladder just above you, he must’ve used the service panel in the roof of the elevator to escape. He must’ve left the briefcase behind in the elevator too since he’s not carrying it anymore. He looks down and pulls out a pistol. He fires several times, but fortunately only hits you in the arm. Unfortunately those bullets are silver and it fucking hurts like hell!\n\n“Argh! Shit! I should’ve known not to trust you, you goddamned invisible bastard!” you yell.\n\nJack stops firing at you and then starts firing at the main elevator cord hitting it. The elevator is now dangerously dangling by a weakened cord. You quickly climb past the elevator before it falls which it inevitably does. You’re safe, but Mr. Hyde isn’t so lucky. The elevator drops at a good speed that even he can’t stop in his position and knocks him off his shaft climb. Hyde makes a deafening roar as the elevator crushes his body when they both hit the bottom. You don’t know if he’s dead yet, but he soon will be, in any case its one less problem to worry about.\n\nYou continue your ascent after Jack, who is now at the top, trying to open the elevator doors. Too bad for him, he doesn’t have enhanced strength like you and is struggling to open them up, while still balancing on the ladder.\n\n“Ha ha, should’ve used your own formula Jack!” you say and grab his leg, digging your claws deeply in.\n“Arrrgh! Let go you mangy dog!”\n“You shouldn’t have double crossed me Jack!”\n“I can see my formula’s made you stronger than I thought, I’ll have to make a note of that after I put an end to you!”\n\nJack pulls out his pistol again which was a big mistake, as now he’s not holding on to anything and is merely balancing on his legs, one of which you’re holding on to…\n\nYou wrench the leg you’ve dug your claws into and pull hard, causing him to fall off.\n\n“NOOOOOOOOO!” he screams as he falls into the dark shaft to his imminent demise.\n\nYou continue your escape by prying the elevator doors open and crawl through panting heavily. You lie face up on the ground for awhile just resting. You think the effects of the formula are wearing off. Too bad, you liked feeling “young” again. You do realize the folly of going against your instinct though; you knew you weren’t just being an asshole to Jack for all these years for no reason. You knew he was shady. He might’ve been telling the truth about Henry, but he was just using you as a “subject” just to test his invention and to hopefully kill Henry in the process. Oh well you came out alive and they’re both dead, you won. Though one thing pisses you off.\n\n“Fuck. The money’s buried down there.” You say to yourself.\n",
  "page 20": "Yeah, you might be feeling in your “prime” and all, but Mr. Hyde is severely out of your weight class right now. You might be quicker, but all he has to do is hit you once and you’re not that good to completely avoid being hit entirely…\n\nAnd when you inevitably feel that pile driver like fist breaking every bone simultaneously in your body you know you’ve been hit. You don’t feel the next one reducing you into a thin red furry paste.\n",
  "page 0": "You wake up in your cabin in the woods. You sit up and scratch some fleas that have infested your body. You also realize its still daylight. You hate waking up early.\n\nYou lope into the bathroom and look in the mirror where you see a canine face covered in gray fur, you remember a time when your fur was completely brown.\n\n“You’re getting old Wolf” you say to yourself like you always do while trying to look on the bright side that at least you don’t have the mange. You think you’d just put a silver bullet in your head if you ever started to go bald.\n\nAfter eating some left over mutton in the fridge and some Gummy Blobs (for the sugar “pick me up”) you ponder how you’re going to pay this month’s rent on your cabin. You call your agent Erik and see if that little pissant has found any work for you. Hopefully it’s an actual job and not just a guest speaker spot at a comic convention.\n\n“Erik! It’s me Wolf! Pick up the fucking phone! I know you’re there!” you say when you get the answering machine.\n\n“Erik! Get on the phone NOW, or I’m gonna go over there and shove a pipe organ up your ass!”\n\nThat got his attention.\n\n“Wolf, I’m sorry, but I fear I’m in a deep depression.”\n“What else is new? Look I need some work, got anything? I don’t even care if it’s straight to video. I just need some of the green stuff!”\n“Sadly, I don’t think I do, but then I haven’t really checked…I’m so depressed. I’ve been wondering if I made the right decisions in my life…and now it’s too late for me to do anything about it, because I’m old…”\n“Join the fucking club Erik! Look do you…”\n“But my art, my music, that is my love and its failing me again. My latest opera isn’t doing well. I wonder if I chose the wrong thing to love and pursue. Just like I did with Christine. Oh Christine WHY couldn’t you have loved me? I loved you…”\n\nWonderful, he’s in full blown tortured artist mode. He can go on like this forever. You can either give up, or persist in getting something out of him.\n",

When you arrive, its exactly who you thought it was, though you don’t understand how you couldn’t have heard him lumbering through the forest given how big he is, let alone seen him.\n\n“Hey Kong! You alive? Wake up!” you shout. Kong stirs a little and then sits up to yawn. He scratches his now silverback and looks over at you.\n“Wolf? What’re you doing here?”\n“Me?

Nancy kicked me out of the house. For good this time, she said she can’t put up with my chauvinism any more. All I told her was to get her ass back in the kitchen and make me a banana split and serve it to me naked.”\n“Sounds like a reasonable request, so what happened?”\n“She went into the kitchen, came back out with a frying pan of hot grease, threw the shit on me and kicked me in the balls, before shoving me out the door and calling me a fucking backward primate.”\n\nYou hold back some laughter, before speaking again.\n\n“Tough break there Kong, but I guess you could look on the bright side, you’re back to your roots with no more cares anymore. Living free in the wild and all.”\n“Are you on fucking crack Wolf? It sucks! You know when I lived on Skull Island I didn’t know any better, but in the last few days I’ve come to realize living in a warm HOUSE and sleeping in a bed is way better than living in the cold wild and sleeping on the ground where bugs crawl all over you!”\n\nKong’s remarks certainly have made you reconsider your previous nostalgia of the old days.\n\n“Well, can’t you just make up with Nancy? Surely if she’s put up with you this long and if you apologized and did all that romantic crap she’d let you back in.”\n“Don’t think so Wolf, I never was good at that, besides she’s got a restraining order on me too.”\n”What else did you do to her?”\n“Nothing! She’s just being a crazy bitch, that’s unwilling to listen to reason. Well unwilling to listen to me anyway. Hey Wolf, you’ve always been a smooth talker with ladies. Maybe you could talk some sense into her for me.”\n“Uh, I dunno Kong I don’t really like getting into the middle of shit like this, don’t you have someplace else to stay, hey what about your cousin Joe?”\n“I’m not staying with him! He’s a fucking fag!”\n“Well, beggars can’t be chooser Kong, besides he’s your cousin it’s not like you have worry about him trying any ass pirate shit on you.

  "page 167": "Its long over due and its time. You need to go fucking kill that bloodsucker or die trying. You need to prove that you are and always will be the baddest of the monsters. You also need to prove to these wolflings that they need to be proud of their fucking heritage and not play second fiddle to some overgrown leeches.\n\n“All right you cubs! We’re going to go raise some fucking hell. We’re going to Dracula’s Castle. We’re going to rip the place apart brick by brick, and every fucking bloodsucker in the goddamned place and I’M going to rip Fagula apart limb from limb, drive a stake in his heart, cut his head off and then shove his dick in his mouth!”\n\nThe Wolflings look very apprehensive about your suggestion, in fact they outright refuse.\n\n“You’re a fucking crazy old coot; if you think we’re gonna follow you to Dracula’s Castle! Fuck that, he’s got an army of bloodsuckers and ghouls and who knows what the hell else! We can’t win that Wolf! Can’t we just bust up a bar or something?” one of them exclaims\n\nYou can’t believe your ears! These snot nosed pups know nothing of their heritage! Back in the old days they would’ve been killed and eaten for such cowardice!\n\n“Goddammit are you Wolves or fucking Chihuahuas? Vampires have been taking OUR rightful place in the monster hierarchy for centuries! We need to set the fucking record straight on this shit! Now are you going to run with me and be a fucking Wolf or are you going to go back home with your tails tucked between your legs?”\n\nAfter looking at each other for awhile they all begin to leave and head back to the studio.\n\n“Oh fuckin’ fine then, play werewolf in a movie, but I can see I’m the only fuckin’ REAL Werewolf here, the rest of you are just goddamn overgrown dingos! Fuck this, I don’t give a shit, I’ll kill Dracula my own goddamned self. I don’t need anybody’s help!”\n\nYou get on your Harley and ride. You only make a few stops on your way; you’re completely driven to have your final showdown with Vlad. Finally after a few days of riding you reach Dracula’s Castle. The place looks exactly the same. You get off your bike and scale the high iron gate. As you jump down into the courtyard you half expect yourself to be overwhelmed by vampires, or even ghouls, but nothing happens. This is weird, there aren’t even any guards patrolling or even at the door. In fact it sounds like a party is going on inside. You hear lots of laughter and music. Suddenly someone comes outside and sees you. It’s some Vampire chick.\n\n“Ohhh, a Werewolf! Wow, I didn’t know any of you types were invited to the party; I thought Drac hated you guys. Well what’re you doing standing outside? Come on in the party’s just starting!” she says waving you in.\n\nA bit of a different approach than you were preparing for, but you enter. You entrance to the ballroom is immediately a big event. You’re the only Werewolf there. Everyone else is either a Vampire, a ghoul, or even a human “servant”. Everyone is staring at you, some with wonder and interest, most with hatred, a few in awe. Most probably haven’t encountered a Werewolf like you before. The staring would probably continue if another slightly out of place being didn’t come shuffling up to you to talk you in a friendly manner causing the bloodsuckers to go back to partying. It’s Im-Ho-Tep. You’re surprised to see him here.\n\n“Wolf?! YOU got an invitation to this thing? I can’t believe it! What the hell did you and Dracula kiss and make up?” he remarks with his scratchy sounding voice.\n“Not in this life time Teppy. What’re you doing here?”\n”Me? Oh you know Vlad, he’s always gotta put on a show. Likes to play up the whole royalty thing to the other bloodsuckers, so he always invites me to these things to prove he’s got connections or something since I was a Prince. I always keep telling him, it’s a meaningless title since the Egyptian Empire fell thousands of years ago, but he insists on flying me out here, making a big fuss and everything so what the hell, it’s not like I got anything better to do plus I get a kick out of watching the bloodsuckers get drunk and make idiots out of themselves, well that and I like to look at some of these Vamp chicks. Heh, guess that makes me a voyeur, but again what the hell, its one of the few pleasures I get in this world anymore. But enough about this dirty old man, what brings you here if you weren’t invited? Just randomly crashing the party?”\n“Sort of…I didn’t even know there was one…I’m here to kill Fagula.” You whisper quietly.\n\nTep’s eyes widen a bit under his bandages. He isn’t entirely surprised (At his age barely anything surprises him anymore) but he was caught a little off guard by your statement.\n\n“Wow Wolf…I can tell you’re really not joking about this. All I can say is… what took you so long? I thought this day would come long before now. Lost some bets because of it, oh well easy come easy go. Well you know your secret’s safe with me, though I suppose it won’t be a secret for too much longer! You’re still the craziest sonofabitch I know, but then you always did know how to liven up a party! Ha ha! Ol’ Vlad will probably be making his grand entrance soon, so just wait awhile. He threw this party for some kind of special announcement he has to make. I still got a bet with Erik that you would win if you and Drac ever got into a battle to the death. I’ll be hoping to collect that bet from Erik. Good luck!” Tep then shuffles off back to where he sitting.\n\nErik bet against you? Fucking little depressed shit! You’re going to have a little talk with him after all this.\n\nYou put your back against the wall, watching everyone while waiting for Dracula to arrive. An hour passes and you’re fucking sick of waiting, you don’t feel like waiting for him to make “an entrance”. You’re here to commit major mayhem on him, not listen to anything he has to say. While you’re surveying the place, you see a disheveled man peek out from a corner across the room and then slink back. That was Renfield, you’d know Fagula’s sycophantic bitch boy anywhere.\n",
  "page 166": "Your recent dealings with Mary, have made you think about all the shit you’ve had to put up with from that no talent dickhead. No human has ever given you such trouble. You know he’s still alive. (Mad scientists always find ways of prolonging their lives somehow) That won’t be true for long though, if you get your way. You killed him once before. This time you’re going to make sure he stays that way.\n\nHe’s probably got whatever crappy inventions and experiments protecting his castle and from what you know, Frankie’s still living with his “Dad” as well.\n\nYou don’t give a fuck, you’ll kill him too. You figure you’ll be doing the world a favor as well as getting some satisfaction. Besides, you’ve got to show these wolflings what being a werewolf is all about.\n\n“All right you cubs! We’re going to go raise some fucking hell. We’re going to Frankenstein’s Castle. We’re going to rip the place apart brick by brick, and I’M going to rip Victor apart limb from limb.”\n“Erm…Castle Frankenstien? Isn’t that where Frankie lives?” one of the wolflings asks.\n“I heard he’s really powerful, didn’t he fight Dracula and win?”\n‘I dunno if we should mess with him.”\n\nYou can’t believe your ears! These snot nosed pups know nothing of their heritage! Back in the old days they would’ve been killed and eaten for such cowardice!\n\n“Goddammit are you Wolves or fucking Chihuahuas? Frankie’s a fucking pussy! I personally kicked his ass before and I’ll do it again all by myself if I have too! Now are you going to run with me and be a fucking Wolf or are you going to go back home with your tails tucked between your legs?”\n\nAfter looking at each other for awhile they all agree to go with you.\n\n“Good! Now I want all of you to transform into your wolf form too! I’m traveling with fellow wolves not humans!”\n\nJust before one of the females begins to transform, you stop her. She’s dressed in a short leather skirt and a tight white t-shirt that’s tied in the center and has long flowing brown hair. You can smell that she’s in heat. You hate to coin a pun, but she literally is one hot l’il bitch.\n\n“Erm, not you. You stay in your human form; I kind of like the whole teenage slut look you got going on. In fact you come here right now; you’ll be traveling on my bike with me.” You say.\n\nAs she slides in behind you and holds on, you ask her one more question.\n\n“So what’s your name?”\n“Ginger. What’s your name, you never did tell us.”\n“Wolf. Just Wolf baby. Remember it. You’ll be screaming it later.”\n\nDamn you’re so fucking cool, you think as you start up your Harley and ride ahead of the pack.\n\n(You’d probably be even cooler if these pups weren’t all riding those Japanese “crotch rocket” bikes, but that’ll have to be another lesson for another day)\n\nAfter a couple of days of riding, and a few “pit stops” with Ginger, you all eventually reach Castle Frankenstein. You park your bikes at the gate, and size the place up, which now looks a lot different. It looks like a damn Nazi fortress now, there’s guard towers and everything. It seems Victor has been keeping himself very busy in recent years.\n\nAs it begins to rain, a familiar voice calls to you from one of the towers.\n\n“Its you. Vic always knew you’d return one day. I never believed him though. I guess I owe him fifty bucks.”\n\nYou look up and see Igor, he looks different too. He has a lot of clumsy cybernetic implants, one of them being some sort of gun in place of an arm. More of Vic’s “handy work” no doubt. He’s still got that damn hump on his back though.\n\n“Igor? You still alive? I thought your ungrateful master would’ve just let you die of old age and get himself another assistant. I see he did a real good job of improving you though. Tell me, how’s it feel to be the real brains, never getting the credit and continuing to be a doormat?”\n“I’m happy with my lot in life. How’s it feel to be broke ass overgrown dog who’s trying to relive his lost youth?” Igor retorts back.\n“Don’t know yet. I’ll tell you before I shove that metal arm up your ass.”\n\nWell looks like the fight’s starting here.\n",
  "page 169": "The Vampire: Vlad III AKA Vlad the Impaler AKA Dracula AKA…\n\nYou’ve got more interesting names to call him though. “Fagula” comes to mind.\n\nAll those movies nowadays that they make about how vampires and werewolves can’t get along were no doubt inspired by you and the bisexual bloodsucker.\n\nYeah that always pissed you off. He was always considered a “ladies man” and yet he was buttfucking his sycophantic manservant Renfield on a regular basis. Fucking pretty boy got all the best looking women throwing themselves at him, while he was getting some massive man meat in his elitist aristocratic undead ass on the side. Blood wasn’t the only thing he was sucking on.\n\nThat pretty boy also got all the best roles; got all the fame, got everything better and he didn’t deserve any of it. He came from fucking money. He was goddamn royalty. He was all those things that humans admire and strive for, looks, money, power, famous, and eternal youth. You didn’t really stand a chance in terms of popularity. Here you were a dirty ruthless “animal” that ripped people apart, while HE was Mr. suave and sexy that seduced his victims. Making death erotic rather than violent.\n\nIn short, humans saw him and saw what they wanted to be. While they saw you, and saw what they were.\n\nIts one of the reasons why you have a big dislike for the undead. They aren’t natural. They don’t have that primal instinct that all living creatures have on some level. Humans and Werewolves both have it. Even all the Alien creatures you’ve had rare encounters with have a primal instinct due to the evolution that existed on their home worlds. The Undead don’t. They’re without emotion. No matter how much they try to mimic it. Any emotion they have is only due to their remembrance of how they reacted to events in their former lives. They don’t BREED naturally. Vampires are just fucking overgrown parasites and leeches in your superior opinion. All they do is try to exploit, hide and lie. And most idiotic humans fall for it. Now there’s a whole sub-culture of wannabe Vampires out there. Nobody wants to be a werewolf though. (Granted you’d probably hate a wannabe werewolf, but that’s not the point.)\n\nIt’s not “sexy” enough. It’s not “dark and mysterious” enough, basically it’s not GAY enough.\n\nBut being a Vampire sure is gay enough though, so let those stupid ass human wannabes go ahead and pretend and worship Vampires. They always find out just how much their “Masters” truly value them and it’s normally as food and at best a “pet”.\n\nWerewolves don’t lie. If they’re going to kill you, they’ll be up front immediately, they won’t string you along. At least you’ve always been that way.\n\nFagula just represents everything you hate about his kind. All of which makes you wonder:\n\nWhere the hell are the Van Helsings of the world, nowadays?\n",
  "page 202": "You figure he really can’t be that long now, and decide to wait. Soon you see Renfield come back, he tells everyone to quiet down on orders of his master.\n\n“Excuse me everyone, I know you’re all anxious to hear what my master has to say, but I have been informed that he will not step into this room until a certain infestation has been taken care of first. Namely THAT ONE OVER THERE!”\n\nSuddenly all the Vampires, Ghouls and Human servants look at you and advance! You’re beyond out numbered. You put up a good fight for someone in your position, but ultimately you are scratched, bitten and sucked dry. And not in the good way either. You are then skinned where your pelt is hung up over Drac’s fireplace, where he always brags about how he defeated you single handedly.\n",
  "page 168": "The Mad Scientist: Dr. Victor Frankenstein\n\nYou don’t strictly have anything against humans. You’ve even been known to get along with a few of them. Victor doesn’t fall into that category though. His “creations” caused much trouble for you, but you had problems with him even before then.\n\nVictor was the typical mad scientist type looking to shock and take the world by storm through weird experiments. He was always jealous of Dr. Moreau who managed to buy an entire island and create a small colony of “man-animals”. Victor wanted that same status, so he tried to do the same thing, but the problem was, he wasn’t as skilled of a doctor.\n\nVictor’s feud with Moreau and his petty human dreams would’ve gone unnoticed at this point had he not tried to perform an experiment on YOU. He invited you over to his place once for an idea of a new movie. After eating a big dinner of mutton, veal, and beef (No pork though, you don’t dig on swine) you promptly passed out from all those products being heavily drugged.\n\nWhen you woke up he was sticking needles into you and had you strapped to a table. He claimed he wasn’t going to do anything except some tests, but you highly doubted that since he also had scalpels nearby. He figured he could successfully duplicate Moreau’s experiments by using your DNA or something.\n\nYou didn’t let him get that far though. The good doctor forgot how strong you were and you easily broke the straps with minimal effort on your part. Your revenge was quick and terrible. In fact you killed him…that is if his assistant Igor (Who had later come home to find his master lying on the floor with his throat ripped open and his arm ripped off) hadn’t got his heart started again with a major jolt of electricity and sewed him back together.\n\nNeedless to say he wasn’t the really the same after that, but Igor’s “quick thinking” lead Victor to the idea of his first creation Frankie, then later Mary. In fact those two were probably his way of attempting to get back at you for killing him and it probably worked to a certain degree.\n\nOf course you weren’t the one who had to piss and shit into a bag for the rest of his life.\n",
  "page 204": "The Mummy: Im-Ho-Tep\n\nIf there was ONE undead who was consistently alright with you, it was Tep. He’s one of the few exceptions to your dislike of the Undead. Ironic, because even without being Undead, his personality was completely different from yours, however you like him because he at least has a down to earth attitude on life. Which is at least a step up from the arrogance of Vampires and most humans.\n\nTep is very very VERY old. He was a Prince at one time during the height of the Egyptian Empire, but he never likes going by that title. He says it’s pointless to hold on to something that doesn’t exist anymore. As a royal Prince he didn’t have as much freedom as he would’ve liked, he basically had to stay in his palace and carry the responsibilities of an Empire which wasn’t as much fun as one might think. He used to read a lot about all the places his advisors and soldiers all traveled to, but he couldn’t ever go. So he decided that he would extend his life through magic so he could do and see all the things he couldn’t while he was alive. When he died at the ripe old age of 33 (Humans didn’t annoying live as long back then like they do now) the spell took effect and he snuck out of his sarcophagus at night. With no more responsibilities he was now allowed to see, go and do whatever and wherever he wanted. In fact his down to earth, observational habits are mainly due to the fact that he’s literally done it all. There really isn’t anything left for him to do anymore, so he gets a small pleasure from watching “Life” in general now. It’s also why he laughs at bloodsuckers who think they’re old, wise, and “done it all”. Even Dracula would be a mere child when compared to how old Tep is. One time Dracula was bragging about this completely decadent orgy he threw one time back in the 1600s that lasted for 6 days. He claimed it had everything and taunted everyone saying that they would never know about the carnal pleasures that were had that week. Tep just laughed and calmly put Vlad in his place that’s become a well known event in Hollywood History:\n\n“Please Vlad spare us of your fat musings, I was married to my younger sister at 13, I personally knew Cleopatra and lived through the Roman Empire during Caligula AND Nero’s reign, let alone all the other shit I saw long before you were even thinking about shoving little old ladies on iron spikes as a petty human dictator. You don’t know fuck about sexual decadence. Whatever you THINK you’ve done has already been done long ago. You’re an unoriginal amateur at best.”\n\nDracula never “bragged” again when Tep was around.\n",
  "page 203": "You push your way through the crowd and head towards where Renfield was lurking about. He isn’t far, you can smell him. You follow a long corridor and then turn the corner to see Renfield hobbling down another passage, you quickly knock him to the floor, turn him over and kneel on his chest. He attempts to struggle, but you’re still too strong for him.\n\n“Well, well, well, I’m surprised your faggot master still keeps you around. Shit, you smell terrible, I suppose along with your flesh rotting, and lousy hygiene in general, all those ass rammings have taken a toll on you eh? Where the hell is he?”\n”You! You’ve always been jealous of the master! Jealous of his wealth, his style and his beauty! You’re nothing, but a lowly animal!”\n“For someone who gets abused in every possible way, has no self respect, and is a filthy Ghoul, I wouldn’t be calling anyone a lowly animal. And you’re not really in the position to be pissing me off anyway. Now where the fuck is Fagula?”\n“The master is going enjoy killing you, especially tonight! Now he’ll be able to claim victory over TWO of his greatest enemies!”\n“What the hell are you blathering about?”\n“Oh you’ll find out…” Renfield smiles with a set of blacken teeth.\n“Yeah whatever, look last chance to…”\n\nSuddenly you feel a powerful crushing blow to the back of your head. It isn’t enough to knock you out, but you fall off of Renfield and roll over feeling very woozy. In your bleary vision you can make out the form of that cocksucker Dracula standing over you. Another figure stands there as well, you don’t know who they are, but they look somewhat familiar.\n\n“Wolf, I don’t believe I invited you to this party, but it was good of you to come anyway. It only makes festivities more enjoyable! I think you’ll give Jacob a good chance of testing himself. I was going to have him fight Renfield, but I’m sure you’ll provide much more of a challenge. You think you’re up for the challenge Jacob?”\n“Sounds perfect to me.” The other figure says and steps closer, and just before he kicks you in the head, you could swear it looks like Van Helsing, but much younger.\n\n“Sonofa…” you begin to say and then get your face kicked in, knocking you unconscious.\n\nTime passes and you wake up in a cage with silver bars. You see the figure that kicked you in the face on the other side, it is Van Helsing…or someone that looks like him since his name was Abraham, not Jacob. You find out soon enough, when he begins to speak.\n\n“Wolf, you’re up. Good. I’m anxious to test my new skills on you. Renfield certainly wouldn’t have been much of a challenge, but you should prove to be. Even my foolish grandfather couldn’t kill you. He couldn’t kill Dracula either, but then Dracula was always superior in everyway. I have no idea why he pursued such an idiotic quest of trying to kill Vampires, they really are the supreme life form on this planet and certainly the most lovely and sensual. Vladimir has shown me such pleasures since our time together.”\nYou shake your head and snicker. This must’ve been the “other” defeated enemy that Renfield was on about.\n“So, that’s how it is now? The Van Helsing bloodline finally defeated not through violence, but through seduction? Never thought I’d see the day come. I had my problems with your family and especially your father, but I could at least respect their dedication. You’re a fucking disgrace kid.”\n“On the contrary, I’m merely ensuring the survival of my family name. What was I supposed to do, carrying on some pointless family tradition of monster hunting, and get myself killed? Fuck that. I want to live forever.”\n“Yeah? Well you can scratch that plan, because when I get a hold of you, you’re going to be wishing you hadn’t turned into a fucking bloodsucker.”\n“(Sigh) Yes, Vladimir told me you were always one to make unimaginative threats, I’ll be more interested in hearing your howls of pain though, see you soon.”\n\nAs Jacob leaves you to your cage. You hear another voice in the room.\n\n“So…Vlad has now eliminated all his enemies, I guess I always knew he’d succeed.”\n\nYou see another holding cell, but one made of some kind of heavy duty unbreakable see-through plastic. The top of it has a ton of garlic hanging from it. Sitting and looking utterly defeated is an ugly distorted looking humanoid, who is yet another face you’re amazed to see. This revenge trip has just been one surprise after another.\n\n“Orlock? Heard you were dead.” you say.\n“I wish I was, unfortunately Dracula insists on keeping me alive…feeding me rats…tormenting me…reminding me of my shameful defeat by his hands…I’m proud of him.”\n“You’re happy that he’s torturing you? Sheesh, all you Undead are fucking masochists.”\n“I’m not happy that he’s torturing me you ignorant dog, I’m happy that he’s proven to be so ruthless, despite his foppish ways. I must admit I had my doubts about him when I first created him.”\n“Yeah, I see that really worked out well for you.”\n“(Sigh) True. But it’s my own fault for having a soft spot for him I suppose. I should’ve been more watchful of him. You’ll be lucky, he’ll just kill you, or rather have his new conquest Jacob do it.”\n“Nobody’s killing me, I’m getting the fuck outta here right now. These bars aren’t going to hold me.”\n“Won’t that be difficult Wolf? Seeing that the bars are made of silver?”\n“So fucking what? Doesn’t mean I can’t touch them! As long as the things aren’t going into my body they don’t mean shit! Thought you bloodsuckers knew that. See that’s the problem with you Vampires, always underestimating your enemies and being melodramatic. If Fagula and his bitch boys were smart they would’ve killed me when they had the chance. That’s what I would’ve done.”\n“You and I actually have more in common than you think. We both are the last of the old ways. I must admit that I too would’ve killed you immediately, rather than toy with such a dangerous enemy.”\n\nYou ignore Orlock and concentrate on the bars. You easily pry the silver bars open and step out of the cage; you then rip one of the bars out to take with you. Orlock looks at you with interest.\n\n“Why are you taking that?”\n“Because unlike you Vampires, we Werewolves try to learn everything we can about our enemies. I know for a fact that silver hurts you fuckers too, though you guys like to try to keep that shit quiet.”\n“Ah. Tis a shame we never clashed Wolf, you would’ve been a worthy opponent.”\n“Yeah? Well when I kill Drac, I can come back to finish you off too.”\n“Ha ha! Glad to see you have such confidence. However, if in the unlikely event that you do defeat Vlad, by all means come back and finish me off to put me out my misery. I would gladly welcome everlasting death at this point.”\n\nYou leave the room and find yourself in a corridor made of dull stone; you’re guessing you’re probably underground. Nobody’s around, but you can still hear the noise of the party above. You’re about to head back up when you hear a voice close by.\n\n“Psst! Wolf! Over here! Quick!”\n\nYou turn around and at one end of the corridor you see Mary. Now what the fuck is SHE doing here?! You rush over to Mary.\n\n“What the fuck are you doing here?” you ask.\n“Trying to prevent you from getting yourself killed, you stubborn macho asshole! When the Wolflings returned to the studio, I asked them where you went, and they told me, so I went after you. What the hell did you think you were doing coming here to kill Dracula?”\n“Just that! Kill his bloodsucking ass! How’d you sneak in here anyway?”\n”I didn’t, I got an invitation about a month ago to the party, so when I arrived I was expected. Then I heard you were taken down here by some of the guests.”\n“Oh I can see you and Drac are still chummy with each other, figures, all you Undead stick together. You’re probably here to help him not me!”\n”Goddammit Wolf, will you stop being so fucking paranoid! I wasn’t even going to this thing; the only reason why I’m here is because of you! Because maybe you don’t want to believe it, but I do love you, you’ve always only been the one to make me feel complete. After all the searching and traveling and trying to discover myself, it was our time together that I always held dear to me and stayed in my mind. Please, Wolf don’t go through with this, we lost a lot of years already; now that we’ve been reunited I don’t want to lose you permanently. This is isn’t worth it. You don’t have to prove anything. I’m familiar with the secret passages in this place, we could leave right now without any trouble.”\n\nMary’s face does show expression of concern, and her voice does display worry. She may or may not be telling the truth. If she isn’t then she’s done a good job of fooling you. However, even if she is telling you the truth, there’s something else at stake here, namely your principles and pride. You’d really hate to run from Dracula, especially at this point.\n",
  "page 205": "The Manservant: Renfield\n\nDracula has had a wide variety of lovers, and it’s well known he doesn’t limit himself to just women. However NOBODY (Gay or straight) could figure out what the hell he was doing with Renfield.\n\nVampires being the vain, shallow and arrogant types they are, tend to only pick the “beautiful” people to have sex with. Indeed that’s the whole reason to be eternally youthful in the first place.\n\nRenfield didn’t fit into that category…ever. He wasn’t even a beautiful person on the inside. While everyone knows about his bug eating, that’s probably the least disgusting thing he’s ever eaten.\n\nDrac has always been a bit of a perverse individual, so he probably first fucked the dirty asylum patient just for kicks and to have a story to tell. Little did even Drac know that that was the kindest act that had ever been done to Renfield, who broke out of that asylum the very next day to track down Dracula and profess his undying love and loyalty to him. His willingness to completely debase himself in everyway imaginable for Drac, is probably one of the reasons why Drac kept him around. Drac always eventually gets bored of his “long term” lovers and begins to act dismissively and abusively to them and eventually no matter how much they were in love with him, they realize that they were just another notch on his fangs and they bitterly leave. Renfield has NEVER left, he routinely has endured all manner of abuse by Drac for years and he still comes back for more, it’s why he ultimately made Renfield into Ghoul to serve him forever. (Another oddity for Drac, since he never creates Ghouls, he prefers “disposable” humans or fawning fellow vampires. Renfield is the only Ghoul, Drac has ever created)\n\nGhouls are considered low in Vampire society. They have some of a Vampire’s power, but at root they’re basically human servants who weren’t considered good enough to be turned into a Vampire. Also while they gain Vampire longevity, they don’t gain the eternal youth, and eventually rot to the point that they look more like zombies. They’re usually treated worse than human servants, since human servants still have “potential”. They’re typically are a miserable bunch who have a lot of anti-social personal habits while they continue to serve their thankless Vampire masters and resentful of the human servants.\n\nRenfield’s life didn’t really change much at all.\n",
  "page 33": "You remember an old saying, “A liar is still a liar even when he’s telling the truth.” And despite Jack telling you the truth about Henry, you can tell he still had his own agenda. In fact it’s obvious he was trying to leave you here to rot.\n\n“Hey Jack what’s that?” you say pointing in his direction\n“Huh?” Jack replies looking down and around himself.\n\nPOW!\n\nYou clock Jack in his bandaged face, cracking his sunglasses and knocking him to the floor. You quickly rummage through his coat and find a pistol and check the clip.\n\n“Well, well, silver bullets. I always knew you weren’t to be trusted! Hell, you sold out Henry pretty quickly. You were using me as a test subject for your formula and were probably were hoping me and Henry would end up killing each other. I knew I wasn’t being an asshole to you for all these years for no reason! I bet this is the money I was never going to receive either right?” you open the briefcase and close it when you see it contains the money.\n“Alright fine Wolf you got me, but what use is there in really killing me? You can have the money, you can escape. Just let me live, besides you owe me a life! Self serving it may have been; if it wasn’t for my formula, you wouldn’t have survived the arena!”\n\nYou better make up your mind either way; you can hear Mr. Hyde climbing closer to your location.\n",
  "page 208": "You stare deeply into Mary’s eyes, grab her and kiss her long and passionately.\n\n“You’re going anyway aren’t you?” she says.\n“I have to.”\n“But why?! You know he’s going to use every dirty trick in the book, he’s not going to fight you man to man. He’ll throw all his followers at you first.”\n“Good, it’s the only chance he’s got to level the playing field.”\n“But you’re severely outnumbered.”\n“Yeah, and they’re going to be overconfident like all those bloodsuckers are. And that I’m gonna beat ‘em, they keep underestimating me. Now you get out of here…don’t worry, we’ll see each other again. Just remember to make those changes in that movie of yours.”\n\nMary gives a weak smile, she doesn’t look convinced that she’ll see you again, but she realizes you have to go. Actually you’re not even sure you’re getting out of this alive, but this is something that you have to do, win or lose. You leave Mary to head back upstairs, while she goes off through one of those passages she was talking about.\n\nAs you’re heading up the twisting staircase, you run into Renfield, who was coming down to get you no doubt. His eyes widen in shock and he turns to run.\n\n“MAST…” he begins to shout and you smash the back of his skull with one of the silver bars. You then turn him over.\n\n“I’m not exactly sure what’s correct way of killing you Ghouls so I’m not going to take any chances.” You say placing your hands around his head and giving his neck a quick snap. He’s still alive, but now unable to move.\n\n“You’ll never defeat the master!” he says defiantly.\n“Yeah, yeah…” you say and shove your fist in his mouth to rip out his tongue. It takes some doing, but eventually you fish out the long slimy body part.\n“I don’t even want to think about where this has been.” You say and throw it away.\n\nAs Renfield helplessly hisses at you, you plunge one of the silver bars through his chest. He begins to melt, he’d probably shriek if he could. When he quickly becomes nothing but bloody bones, you remove the skull and throw it into the wall where it shatters and take back your silver bar.\n\nRenfield won’t be coming back.\n\nYou finally reach the ground floor again and follow the sounds of the party. The guests have already heard about what you did earlier, and when you run into a few of them in the hallway they give you some problems. Fortunately they’re a lot of flash and no substance. Three vampire guests attack and you quickly use your silver bar to smack them around. After knocking them all to the ground, you disable one by breaking his neck, while you’re doing that, one of them attacks you from behind where upon you grab and flip him into a small table which splinters into pieces. He tries to get back up, but you kick him in the face, grab one of the table legs and shove it into his chest.\n\nYour last would be attacker seeing what you’ve done runs off. You shake your head.\n\n“Sheesh, what happened to the days when you bloodsuckers actually put up a good fight?” you say and shove another table leg into the chest of the vampire whose neck you just broke.\n\nYour little rumble in the hallway has most definitely been heard, but the rest of your journey to the ballroom continues with no other interruptions. Upon your arrival, the rest of the guests just watch you. Dracula lounges on a fancy couch on the far side of the room while his followers to grovel over him, Jacob being the most fawning.\n\n“So is Jacob going to be the next Renfield?” you shout which gets you his attention and a very hostile look from Jacob.\n“Ah Wolf, you’ve arrived. Where is Renfield anyway, I sent him to fetch you. I do hope you didn’t hurt him too badly.” Dracula, says without even looking at you.\n“I regret to inform you that your favorite jizz jar is no longer among the living or the undead. He’s just plain dead.”\n“(Sigh) Ah well, it was bound to happen eventually, but still I will miss his…enthusiasm. But this is no time to morn past losses, tonight is a time of celebration! Jacob, a member of the Van Helsing family. The mortal enemies of vampires everywhere, and the source of the notorious Abraham Van Helsing, who nearly ended my life. A family of murderers, yet Jacob has abandoned his homicidal family tradition and become one of us, proving that even the most implacable of foes can one day become friends…and more.” Dracula says giving Jacob a lecherous stare, but then finally looks over in your direction and his demeanor changes to that of anger as he points at you the whole time.\n“But some foes always remain. These types are the OLD, the JEALOUS, the BITTER, and the HATEFUL that are so miserable with their own pathetic existence that they feel they must ruin other people’s happiness to make themselves feel better. This…this ANIMAL that stands before us is attempting to do just that! He is the pinnacle example of everything that’s wrong with his kind! The animals have always been jealous of us, and that will never change. Every now and then when a dog runs wild, it becomes necessary to slap it down and put it back in its place, but there are other times when it becomes rabid and needs to be destroyed. And that’s what you are Wolf and rabid dog that’s too stupid to know when to bow before your masters. Jacob, prove your love for me, destroy this animal.”\n“With pleasure.” Jacob says to Dracula and steps towards you baring his fangs.\n",
  "page 32": "While you turn around to reach the panel, Jack reaches into his coat pocket for a pistol. One loaded with silver bullets. He fires three into your back, then when you fall to the floor in a heap, he puts the final one into your head.\n\n“Sorry Wolf, but you never were anything more than a test subject for my invention. Glad to see it worked very well, you have my thanks… I suppose you can keep this briefcase of money, I’ll make a fortune with my formula after I dispose of your friend Mr. Hyde of course.”\n\nJack dumps the briefcase on your dead body and climbs through the service panel and hops to the emergency elevator where he fires his pistol at the main elevator cable, hitting it and causing it to dangle a bit and then finally falling. This of course kills Mr. Hyde since even he can’t withstand such a heavy force at such a speed when it knocks him off and then finally crushes him when they both reach the bottom of the shaft.\n\nJack makes his good escape, makes up a story about you and Henry to discredit him and his work, and finally makes millions of dollars from his formula.\n",
  "page 207": "You’re a lot older and not exactly at one hundred percent right now.\nDracula is still in peek condition.\nYou’re on his home turf.\nThere are other hostile Vampires, Ghouls and Humans here, not to mention Dracula’s new boy Van Helsing.\n\nYou’re not going to win this one.\n\nMaybe if you were still alone you’d do it anyway, but Mary’s words have had an effect on you. Your pride in the past is what got you into a lot of trouble, and most of it was unnecessary. With age comes wisdom, and maybe its time you started to act your age. Your past accomplishments have spoken for themselves; you don’t need to prove you still have “one last fight” in you. Why die pointlessly for some feud that nobody else cares about, and throw away a potentially good future with Mary?\n\n“Alright Mary, alright.” You say.\n\nMary looks surprised, as if she thought you wouldn’t listen to her, but she’s pleased never the less. Having been involved with Dracula and been in his castle in the past, she is of course quite familiar with the secret passages of the place and you both leave quietly.\n\nAfter resting up a bit, you get back to work on that movie with Mary. You of course still insist on her making changes to the script, which she does. The movie comes out and its relatively successful, it’s not going to make you a superstar again, but it’s good enough. Eventually you move in with Mary and live out the rest of your life with her.\n\nYou always expect Dracula to attempt to get you somehow for escaping, but he never does. In fact that whole event is never even brought up or made public, since you were also expecting slanderous attacks about how you ran away to show up in magazines or something. Maybe it was because he was too busy having trouble with his new lover Jacob attempting to get palimony, or maybe he didn’t think the feud was that important either.\n\nYou still always will wonder what might’ve happened…\n",
  "page 35": "“Fuck you Jack, I would’ve survived the arena even without your wonder drug, now how about I make myself invisible too?” and with those words you take off Jack’s cracked sun glasses and shove two claws in where his eyes would be located, you know you got the right spot since you can feel the squish of the ocular jelly and his screams of agony.\n\nWhile you’d normally finish the job you don’t have time since you hear Mr. Hyde bounding on the bottom of the elevator, making dents in it. You grab the gun and the briefcase and leap up through the service panel in the roof, leaving Jack to writhe in unbelievable pain. Still hearing Mr. Hyde trying to get in, you leap to the emergency ladder, you’re having difficulty holding on to the ladder, the gun AND the briefcase though, and guess which one you accidently drop?\n\nThe briefcase of course.\n\n“Goddammit!” you shout as it tumbles from you. “Well someone’s paying for that!”\n\nYou point the gun at the main elevator cable and fire, hitting it a couple times. It dangles a bit and then falls onto Mr. Hyde who is in no position to be able to stop it. Eventually the elevator hits the bottom of the shaft with Jack’s dying body inside and crushing Mr. Hyde under it.\n\nYou continue your escape by prying the elevator doors open and crawl through panting heavily. You lie face up on the ground for awhile just resting. You think the effects of the formula are wearing off. Too bad, you liked feeling “young” again. You’re also pissed that you dropped the damn briefcase of money. You’d climb down and get it, but you’re honestly too damn tired and can’t be bothered. You’re starting to really feel the pain from all the physical activity you’ve been doing today.\n\n“Damn, I really am getting too old for this shit.” You say to yourself.\n",
  "page 209": "The Hunters: The Van Helsings\n\nNo group of humans ever actively caused as much trouble for the bloodsuckers than the Van Helsings. You’d actually like them, had they not hunted Werewolves as well.\n\nThe Van Helsing family had a long standing tradition of hunting Vampires, they eventually stretched out to hunt other monsters as well, but Vampires were always their main target. They first got their start sometime during the medieval ages and each generation just continued the tradition.\n\nOddly just as monsters had to adapt to the changing times, so did the Van Helsings. No longer could they just barge into a house and kill someone because they were a Vampire, indeed most of the people who were bitten by Vampires claimed it was consensual and there for the Van Helsings had no right to intrude on what two beings did in private. Subterfuge abounded as Vampires in high political offices or positions of power manipulated laws to encourage more “liberal” policies. This still did not deter the Van Helsing family, but it did cause disillusionment and less of them enthusiastically took up the tradition of monster hunting.\n\nAbraham Van Helsing is probably the best known one for his continual hunt and battles with Dracula. Despite his best efforts he could never defeat him and ultimately lost all his friends and his life in the finally confrontation. (Yes, the movies like to give the “happy ending” to the tale, but reality is always much darker) His son Ishmael Van Helsing took up the mantle next, but fearing to follow in his father’s footsteps he didn’t pursue Dracula. Instead he hunted less powerful Vampires and other monsters, including you. There were a couple times he attempted to assassinate you, but the last time he tried, you managed to catch him and rip him limb from limb.\n\nJacob would be the next one to take up the mantel, but he showed little interest in it, and that would seem to be the end of Van Helsing tradition.\n",
  "page 36": "“Alright, you got me in a generous mood, plus there really isn’t enough time for me to kill you properly, but here!” you throw the briefcase at him which he catches. “You’re making yourself useful, carry that, I’LL keep your pistol.”\n\nYou exit the elevator through the service panel in the top of the elevator with Jack following behind you. Mr. Hyde is attempting to punch his way through the bottom of the elevator.\n\nYou point the gun at the main elevator cable and fire, hitting it a couple times. It dangles a bit and then falls onto Mr. Hyde who is in no position to be able to stop it. Eventually the elevator hits the bottom of the shaft crushing Mr. Hyde under it.\n\nYou continue your escape by prying the elevator doors open and crawl through panting heavily. You then pull Jack up while holding them open. Both of you are very tired.\n\n“Damn, I think that formula of yours is wearing off Jack.” You pant.\n“Hmm, that’s interesting; I’ll have to make a note of that. Well here’s your money. I suppose this is where we part ways, I guess I should thank you for not killing me and being a good subject for my formula. I anticipate the government will be very pleased with it. More than they would’ve been with Henry’s clumsy formula at least. You really do have my eternal gratitude Wolf.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, you better get the hell outta here Jack before I catch my breath and change my mind about letting you live.” You say snatching the briefcase.\n\nJack turns to leave, but you tell him one more thing.\n\n“And Jack…don’t let me catch your scent near me again or you’ll find that invisibility won’t be enough to protect you.”\n",
  "page 39": "They’re already upon you, so there’s nothing else for it, you’ll have to fight, but you still have a plan to escape.\n\nAs soon as the first hulking freak is trying to bash your head in, you dodge and rake him across the eyes. This earns you a flailing backhand to the wall as it roars in pain, but you’ve effectively taken him out of the fight. Now the other two attempt to take advantage of you while you try to recover. You narrowly miss a punch that puts a large crack in the wall.\n\n“Goddamn it, kill the fucking mongrel!” Henry screams.\n\nYou run up to the blind subject who’s still wailing and lumbering around swinging at anything. You jump up on its back and hold on as it tries to grab you. The two other freaks decide to tackle the both of you. As soon as the first one lunges into the blind one with a sickening crunch, you leap from him and on to the back of the second freak and then with all your might leap again through the glass of observation area!\n\n“Sucks to be you Henry!” Jack says and runs off in the corner and takes off his clothing in a vain attempt to hide. Henry doesn’t say anything, he just reaches into his lab pocket for something; it’s a vial which he fully attempts to drink from.\n\nNot wishing to deal with Mr. Hyde, you quickly knock the vial out of his hand and grab him by the throat. Henry looks helplessly over at the vial which falls to the floor and shatters leaking out all its contents.\n\n“Got any last words before I rip your fucking spine out?”\n“Urg. (Choke) Wait! Don’t you want to know why? See it from my point of view?”\n“Fuck no! Besides Jack tried to warn me before all this shit went down, I thought he was lying though. Looks like you turned out to be the treacherous one. Too bad, I thought you were one of the few alright humans I knew.”\n“Hold on, we can still work this out, I mean maybe I…”\n\nYou silence Henry’s pathetic pleas for mercy, with a quick snap to his neck; you don’t bother doing anything else, since you don’t really feel like wasting any more effort on him. You look down into the arena area where the three subjects have now turned on each other in a spectacularly bloody way. You can still sense someone in the room you’re in.\n\n“Jack! I know you’re here! I might not be able to see you, but you know damn well I can smell your scent!”\n”Hey, calm down Wolf, I did try to warn you!”\n”Yeah I know and that’s why I’m not trying to kill you too, well that and the fact that I’m too damn tired, maybe later.”\n\nJack quickly changes the subject away from his possible death.\n\n“Well I suppose you’ll be wanting your payment. You might as well have it, since you did me a favor by killing Henry anyway. Now I can test my own serum, and I won’t have to share the credit with him. There’s a briefcase under the table over there.”\n\nYou go over to pick it up, check it and head home where you collapse on your bed. You’ll be feeling the pain from all of this for days.\n\nStill, it beats being a “guest speaker” at a comic convention.\n",
  "page 170": "In your prime you would’ve been able to scale the gate, climb the tower and rip Igor’s head off all without getting hit.\n\nUnfortunately you aren’t in your prime anymore. Igor’s having trouble aiming his awkward arm-gun, but with as many bullets as it pumps out he doesn’t need to be completely accurate. While you’re attempting to climb over the gate he hits you several times.\n\nNaturally those bullets are silver.\n\nYou crash to the wet ground with a loud CLANK! sound, as the rest of the pack go running away with their tails between their legs.\n",
  "page 172": "The Assistant: Igor\n\nYou’ve never really had much contact with Igor, other than knowing he’s Victor’s assistant. For awhile you thought he and Vic had something ELSE going on, (Much like Vlad and Renfield) but that’s not the case. Igor’s just a loyal henchman.\n\nYou always wondered why he is though. Despite general public perception, he’s not stupid. In fact, he’s been the one that’s given Vic most of his “successful” experiment ideas. Vic wouldn’t even be around if it hadn’t been for Igor. Vic doesn’t seem to appreciate any of his help though and doesn’t treat him very well. He treats his experiments better than he treats Igor. You can only guess Igor is a masochist, or has some severe self-esteem problems.\n\nProbably both.\n",
  "page 171": "You tell everyone to get the hell out of Igor’s range and take cover. Fortunately Igor’s gun-arm isn’t the best design and he’s having problems aiming and standing still due to the recoil, so you all manage to hide behind some nearby rocks\n\nStill, there’s no way you’re going to be able to scale the front gate with Igor on that damn tower.\n\n“See I knew this was a bad idea!” one of the wolflings says.\n“How are we supposed to get past that? I’m pretty sure he’s firing silver bullets at us.”\n“Oh I KNOW he is. Hence the reason why I told everyone to get out of the way. Okay so we’re not going through the front gate, the castle’s a big place right? Igor’s only guarding the front. I say we split up and scale the walls on the sides and around the back. We’ll meet up inside the castle.”\n“Yeah, but won’t there be other defenses?”\n“Probably. So you better be fucking prepared! This ain’t no damn game. You cubs think you’re really tough when in fact you’ve probably never had a real challenge. This is it. Don’t think about backing out now. This is where we truly test the idea of survival of the fittest. Damn, my blood is starting to feel that rush! Don’t you all feel it? I haven’t felt this way since they sent a group of ten “werewolf assassins” to put me down. Shit. They never tried that again! Ha ha ha ha ha!”\n\nWhile you’re reveling in gruesome nostalgia, your pack is looking at you like you’ve completely lost it. And they’re probably right. However, your speech seems to have stirred something in them.\n\n“The crazy old fossil’s right! I remember having to hear about similar stuff my grandfather used to talk about all the damn time. I never really paid any attention to it before. Now I think I understand. We need to prove our skills to truly be proud to call ourselves werewolves!” one of them states.\n“Now that’s the attitude I’m talking about!”\n\nYou all huddle in the rain and make a howling noise in unison to the moon and proceed with your plan. You all split up into a couple of groups and begin to scale the side and back walls, which really isn’t all that difficult. You know Igor’s probably ran off to warn Vic though. All you can think is, he better have something better than just Igor and Frankie defending him.\n\nAs you prowl around in the courtyard, you hear moaning and the clomping of several footsteps. You and your group turn to see some of Vic’s defenses.\n\n“Zombies? Are you fucking kidding me Vic? I thought you’d at least have some robots or something!” you say to yourself. Though upon a second look, you see that the horde of corpses aren’t actually zombies. Zombies are complete corpses brought back to life. These things look more like Frankie, except designed even worse. A lot of them have arms and legs in odd places. Some have a couple of heads or extra limbs. Most aren’t even stitched together neatly, there are just giant rivets and spikes sticking out, holding them together. These are probably some of his “failed” experiments.\n\nDoesn’t matter, they’re close enough to be Undead for you.\n",
  "page 174": "Damn straight! That’s what you’re here for!\n\nYou take out the nearest pile of shit with ease and your pack follows suit. They’re a little tougher than you thought, but limbs are flying everywhere. Needless to say you’re really enjoying yourself, and you can see your pack is too. (Well the ones that haven’t gotten themselves killed)\n\nYou attack one large experiment with four arms, it catches a few heavy hits on you, before you rip them off. It’s relentless and begins smashing its head (Which contains a lot of jagged metal bits) into you, knocking you down. As you shake it off, Ginger (Who’s now in wolf form) and a couple of other wolflings comes to your aid and finish off the large abomination.\n\n“Godammit! I had that! Don’t EVER come to help me! I can handle myself!” you snarl angrily.\n“We were just helping…” Ginger says casting her eyes downward and lowering her ears.\n\n“…yeah…well…just don’t let it happen again…” you say understanding they weren’t really trying to embarrass you. “Come on, we’re done here, let’s get in the castle.”\n\nYou meet up with the ones remaining in your pack at the front door of the castle. You put all your muscle into it and rip the doors of their hinges. When you step inside, you narrowly dodge a laser beam of some sort.\n\n“He’s got the whole place trapped, be careful where you…”\n\nA wolfling steps on some floor stone that releases yet another beam trap, reducing him to ashes.\n\n“Step.” You say completing the sentence. That’s when you hear a loud speaker.\n\n“Wolf! Igor informed me you had arrived with some friends! I’m actually glad you’re here I get to test out my new experiment on you! Assuming you survive long enough to get to me of course!”\n\nAt this point he does his typical Mad Scientist laugh. If he thinks you’re going to waste your time in his castle of death traps he’s sadly mistaken. He seems to have forgotten you have an excellent sense of smell and tracking in general.\n\nOf course the smell of dead bodies seems to be emanating everywhere. You try to sniff out a human scent, but you aren’t getting anything solid. The dead body smell is too overpowering. You’re catching a couple of different ones though. One of them is a very faint sweet smell. The other is a burning type smell.\n",
  "page 175": "You don’t have time to fight some half ass experiments, the wolflings can handle that. You’re after a bigger prize. You leave the pack behind and run to the front door of the castle where upon you rip it off the hinges.\n\nYou’re in such a hurry to kill Victor; you don’t proceed cautiously enough and forget that he’s probably trapped the place. You step on a floor panel and a laser beam suddenly shoots out, incinerating you into ash.\n",
  "page 156": "“Look Irena, I’m not here to fight, I just want to see Lawrence.”\n\nSpeaking of whom, Lawrence arrives at the door; he’s very surprised to see you.\n\n“Dad?! What’re you doing here?”\n“I don’t really know, you can thank Mary here for even convincing me though… look we need to talk in private, I can’t be doing this shit in front of everyone.”\n\nLawrence nods understanding completely and invites everyone in, Mary and Irena go off together while you and your son enter a study of some sort, where you have a fairly long talk. You find out that he runs his own security business, and is his own boss, which is something you can certainly respect. He excitedly tells about everything that’s occurred in his life since you “disowned” him. Its weird, he doesn’t seem to hold any kind of grudge or anything towards you. He’s just so happy you’re here. Must be a trait he picked up from his human mother’s side, because you know damn well he didn’t inherit it from you. If the roles were reversed, you’re certain you would’ve slammed the door in your own face.\n\nFor once you’re glad Lawrence isn’t completely like you. You also realize that you have been unreasonable for all these years. You still don’t approve of your son’s choice in mates, but like Mary said, you need to get over it.\n\nJust then a couple of little furballs come wandering into the room, they look like Wolf cubs, but the unmistakable feline features are there. They look at you with wide eyes.\n\n“Hey, Tom and Isis. Come closer, I want you to meet someone.” Lawrence says.\n“Who’s that Daddy?” Tom asks.\n“That’s your grandfather.” Lawrence says picking one up. “Dad you’ve never even seen your own grandchildren. You want to hold them?”\n“Uh…erm…I don’t think we’re quite there yet Lawrence.” You say\n“Okay, I understand…hey! We’re having dinner soon, you should stay!”\n“I dunno it might be weird.”\n“Nonsense! Look if you think you’re going to get into it with Irena, I can tell you it won’t happen if you don’t say anything to her. She’ll keep quiet if you do. I hope you can be a little civil, I know it sucks when I have to be civilized to clients for my job, but you know how it is.”\n“Yeah I know how it is. Alright I can do it. Hell, I’ve come this far. This is a whole new experience for me. I hope just hope you’ve got some good food.”\n“Of course! We’re not vegetarians here you know!”\n“Well that’s good, or else I would’ve had to disown you again!” you badly joke.\n\nThere’s a period of silence, and you think you might’ve stepped over the line, however Lawrence begins to laugh.\n\n“Disown me? If I become a vegetarian, just put a fucking silver bullet in my head! Ha ha!”\n\nYou laugh too, and breathe a sigh of relief. You remind yourself that you’ll have to do a better job of your words at the dinner table!\n\nDinner is a pleasant affair; Irena certainly is an excellent cook. In fact it looks like she’s an excellent housewife in general. You’ve noticed the house is spotless. She might be a house cat, but she’s certainly not a lazy one. Maybe there are exceptions to Cat People. She doesn’t talk to you, but she doesn’t start anything either. Everyone eats except Mary who doesn’t require it, but she looks happy that you’re here making an effort to get along with everyone. You can’t be sure, but you get the impression that she did this for herself as much as she did for you. Mary’s own “family” is pretty fucked up and she’s unable to have children of her own. Maybe in some ways she hoped to create a “surrogate” family that she could be apart of instead and all that was missing was you.\n\nThe doorbell rings.\n\n“Who could that be?” Lawrence asks Irena.\n“I don’t know, I’ll go check.”\n\nIrena gets up to answer the door and you can hear a loud voice in the next room.\n\n“Sis! It’s so good to see you! How about a hug for your brother?”\n\nYou hear some muttering and whispering, but can’t quite make it out. A few seconds later, another Irena and another Cat Person enters the room. You don’t like him. He’s fat and scruffy. He looks like scum and smells like scum. All your previous good feelings immediately start to dissipate. Mary looks over at you.\n\n“Uncle Oliver!” the furballs say in unison.\n“Hey, kids! It’s been a long time since I’ve seen you! I’ll be staying here for awhile so we’ll have lots of time to play!”\n\nYou don’t like him.\n\n“Hey Lawrence…I hope you’ve been taking good care of my sister.” He says with almost a hint of distain.\n\nYou really don’t like him.\n\n“Who’s this couple?” he asks when noticing you and Mary. He gives you an unmistakable hostile stare.\n\nYou hate him.\n\nYou immediately whisper to Mary. “Who the fuck is this shithead?”\n“Its Irena’s brother, Oliver. I don’t know too much about him, this the first time I’ve met him in person.”\n",
  "page 157": "So much for civility…\n\n“Peeyew! It smells like a fucking litter box emanating from the house!”\n“Wolf! You said you’d be civil!” Mary remarks.\n“Doesn’t sound like something I’d say.”\n“Mary, why’d you bring this dick here?” Irena asks.\n“Because I THOUGHT he wanted to reunite with his son, not be obnoxious!”\n\nJust then your son comes to the door. He’s even more surprised to see you.\n\n“Dad? What, what’re you doing here?”\n“Insulting your wife so far.” Irena answers.\n“I don’t need to insult your feline ass; you people do a good enough job of that yourself by your mere existence.”\n“Now that’s enough Wolf!” Mary says hitting you.\n“Fuck you, you mean old bastard!” Irena says.\n“Dad, come on stop. Look let’s all go inside and…”\n\nNow two little furballs come to the door, they look like Wolf cubs, but the unmistakable feline features are there. They look up at you with wide eyes.\n\n“Who’s that Daddy?”\n“That’s your grandfather.” Lawrence says picking one up. “Dad you’ve never even seen your own grandchildren. You want to hold them?”\n“Don’t let that bastard hold them! He’s never bothered to see ANY of his grandchildren! Fuckin’ deadbeat!” Irena says.\n“Shit, they’d be safer with me than they are with you! You better watch your kids Lawrence, she’ll be trying to molest them soon, if she isn’t already, you know how those fuckin’ cats are!”\n\nOooh boy you really crossed the line that time.\n\n“WOLF!” Mary shouts.\n“How fucking DARE you! Fuck you! I don’t need to be insulted on my own property! Get the fuck out!”\n“Dad, you’re out of line! You can’t just come here and insult my wife and family like this!”\n“Oh so that’s how it is eh? I’ve been hearing about how you want to see me so bad, but now you’re showing your true colors. You’re gonna side with your wife, instead of your blood. Shit, I knew you were whipped. I wasted my fucking time all those years ago trying to groom you to take my place and there’s no point in wasting my time here, I’m fuckin’ done. Enjoy your fuckin’ life with your cat bitch and your halfcat brats.” As you turn around you address Mary. “Yeah, this was a great idea Mary. If you want a ride back home, I’ll be on my bike waiting a few minutes, if not, you can get a ride from either the inbreeder or the traitor.”\n\nYou get on your bike and wait awhile for Mary, but it’s apparent she isn’t following, so you take off and leave. Fuck her too and if she doesn’t want to work on the movie idea with you; then fuck that as well, you’ll survive somehow, you always have. It’s what you do best. You had a temporary moment of weakness, but when it came down to it, you stuck by your principles. You might be an old and broke, but at least you’re not fucking a cat thing.\n",
  "page 159": "There’s a limit to your tolerance and you’ve just reached it. This lowlife is going to piss you off severely. You better just leave now, before you turn this place into a warzone.\n\n“Well, I’d like to stay, but me and Mary have a lot of work to do on a new movie.”\n“We do?”\n“Yes! Remember all those rewrites?” you give her hand a squeeze and look at her while moving your head slightly in the direction of Oliver. She gets the hint.\n“Oh yeah, we have to go.”\n“Oh, well okay. I hope you’ll come by again soon though!” Lawrence says.\n\nAs you and Mary head towards the door, you turn back around and look at the house, look at his wife, look at his children and then look at that other… cat person. You can only change so much. You can’t see yourself being “part of the family” This is your son’s life not yours.\n\n“I’m sure we’ll see each other again someday.” You say.\n\nLawrence looks a little disappointed, but understands.\n\n“Yeah, I’m sure we’ll have a good time then.” He replies.\n“Goodbye and good luck son.”\n\nYou and Mary get on your bike, wave goodbye and zoom off.\n\nDuring the ride you feel like you should say something to Mary, who you think is probably just as disappointed as your son was.\n\n“I’m sorry Mary, I just can’t change that much.”\n“I know. I suppose it was too big of a step. You did really make an effort though, and you at least reconciled with Lawrence.”\n“Hey I reconciled with you too…so are we like moving in together or should we still keep our own places?”\n“Excuse me? What’s all this? Are you suggesting that we should get back together?”\n“Well you were the one who brought it up first, and yeah you were right about a lot of stuff. I probably should have someone special in my life at my age. And since you’re about the only one who’ll put up with me on a long term basis, you’re the best candidate.”\n“Wow, Wolf with words like that, you REALLY make a girl feel special!”\n“You know I like everything else about you. I don’t need to say it.”\n“Hmm, what makes you think I still want to be with you?”\n“Oh please, you know you want this. Besides your hands are supposed to be around my waist, not fondling my crotch every five minutes.”\n\nMary laughs at your remark and kisses you on the cheek. She rests her head on the back of your shoulder and just holds you normally for the rest of the trip, giving you a bit of a hugging squeeze every now and then.\n\nSometimes a little change isn’t always a bad thing.\n",
  "page 44": "You’re not about to go traipsing across the world to save a bunch of hippy freaks from some dumb ass Martians.\n\n“I don’t think so Moreau, see ya around.” You say and get up to leave the bar, before anyone else asks you for any favors. You don’t get two feet outside of the place and suddenly you’re assaulted by a terrible smell. The stench is not unlike that of hot garbage during a heat wave. You turn around holding your nose and see Andre with his big ol’ stupid grotesque fly head.\n\n“Hey Wolf... Can you spare me some money?” he asks\n“Fuck Andre! Stand the hell away from me! What the hell? Did you roll around in a septic tank?”\n“Uh no, I just ate some fresh turds back in the alleyway…”\n“I don’t even know why I asked you that, I already knew the answer. Ugh.” you say continuing to hold your nose.\n“They tasted pretty good to me. Hey, but I could use some of that sweet sugar. You got any spare change so I can get me a box of the stuff?”\n“Fuck no! I barely have enough money for me! Phew! Just get the fuck away!”\n“Aw come on, help a brother out.”\n“Broth… what the…look nevermind, I ain’t got time for this shit Andre, if you want sugar so bad just go into a fast food place and stock up on those little free packets!”\n“I can’t! A lot of those places use that artificial sugar now! Don’t those idiotic humans know that stuff can cause cancer?! Besides whenever they see me coming they start spraying raid on me and hitting me in the head with swatters. I’ve even attempted to sneak in quietly, but they always seem to sense I’m coming, I can never understand how they do that.”\n“Gee, I can’t imagine how they’d be able to do it, Andre.” You say still holding your nose futility trying to block out Andre’s odor.\n“I just wish I could get with Janice, she’s got ALL the sugar! (Buzz) But she won’t have anything to do with me; She thinks I’m just low class trash.”\n“Well if you’re eating shit, I’d say she’s pretty much right.”\n“It’s not just her sugar I’m after though, I think she’s beautiful! She has such heavenly wings, and a nice abdomen! Yep she really kept herself in good condition after all these years. (Buzz)”\n“Yeah that’s real nice Andre, tell someone who cares.”\n\nYou start to leave and then Andre has the nerve to grab you by the arm.\n\n“Wolf, please you gotta help me out! I can’t live like this anymore, I thought I could being part fly and all, but it’s getting too bad! I’m nearly killed everywhere I go and I’m getting too old to defend myself adequately! Humans hate the sight of me and I disgust them! I need to a home! Janice has a home! You gotta help me convince her that we should be together! Look, you know she’s rich too! You said you were in need of money too right? Maybe if we’re successful, something can be worked out.”\n",
  "page 43": "“Aw hell, if the past is any indication Martians ain’t shit. I don’t have anything better to do. Let’s get going.” You remark.\n\nYou and Moreau leave the next day to his island by private plane. When you arrive you can see why the place is considered a paradise, its basically untamed wilderness with some agricultural improvements and basic structures to house the citizens.\n\nSpeaking of citizens, you see them in person. They’re a motley looking bunch. You see boar boys, goat girls, manatee men, and wombat women and those are some of the regular ones. Some look like they’ve been mixed with several species of animals, so you can’t even be sure what the hell they are.\n\nMoreau’s citizens are equally interested in you.\n\n“Are you another citizen?” one of them asks as they all attempt to crowd you.\n“What? Hell no! I’m a fucking werewolf! Not a freak of nature!” you snarl, not wanting them to touch you. Moreau take the opportunity to make sure you don’t kill anyone.\n“This is Wolf. He’s different than you…in several ways. But he’s here to help us with our current problem, just like our aquatic friend who volunteered to help a few days ago.”\n\nYou stop Moreau.\n\n“Aquatic friend? You got someone else to help you?” you ask.\n“Well yes, I wasn’t sure if you’d help, so I tried to get others as well. You and he were the only takers it seems though. I’m pretty sure you and he are familiar with each other. I can’t pronounce his real name, but he goes by Gil.”\n\n“Gil?! You got GIL?! He was almost as reclusive as you! How’d you get him to help?”\n“I don’t know. It was really just a gamble. I made the same deal, but I had little hope of him accepting it since he’s not exactly fond of land dwellers. He accepted though since he’s tired of having humans intrude on his home every five minute. He already has a place set aside for himself on the island. I just hope the island is still ours after all this.”\n“Where is he?”\n“He keeps to himself in a nearby swamp. He likes his privacy and I respect it. You and he can talk later. I’d like you to get to the training. The Martians will be coming soon, I’m predicting in a matter of days.”\n“DAYS!? You didn’t say that before! How am I supposed to train these freaks in days?”\n“Please Wolf you must try! Gil tried and didn’t get very far; he may have even given up. I was hoping you might have more luck since you’re a bit closer to my citizens.”\n“I’m nothing like your citizens…but I’ll see what I can do.”\n",
  "page 46": "You and Moreau have never had any dealings with each other before, so you’re kind of curious to as why he wanted to see you. You approach Moreau and he’s tripping over himself to thank you for seeing him. You’re a little suspicious of this treatment, especially since you’ve never been welcomed by anyone before.\n\n“Wolf, its Wolf right? Or do you prefer Mr. Wolf?”\n“Wolf is fine…will you tell me why the hell you want to see me so badly for? We’ve never had anything to do with each other before.”\n“Yes. Quite correct. My Vision didn’t lead me to interact socially that much. Maybe I shouldn’t have concentrated so much on my Vision though. Maybe I should’ve been more flexible. If I had, I might not have the problems I have now.”\n“Okay, so will you quit with the fucking mystery already and tell me what’s going on?”\n“As you know I transformed my island into a utopia where no being harms another.”\n“Pfft, some Utopia. I call it fucking with nature.”\n“And you know what? I agree with you. At one time, I would’ve dismissed you as a vicious animal that only pleased his primal instincts.”\n“You say it as if it’s a bad thing.” You utter.\n“I once thought so…but now I’m starting to see reality for the first time. My Utopia wasn’t followed by the world…it was hated. It was despised. Most are jealous of what I’ve done and want to destroy it.”\n“Duh, that’s humanity for you. So are you getting to the point anytime soon?”\n“My Utopia is about to be destroyed, but NOT directly. No human nation wants to look like the bad guys so you know what they’ve done instead? They’re letting Martians do it for them!”\n“What? Martians aren’t even allowed on this planet after all the unsuccessful attacks they’ve attempted on it.” You exclaim.\n“See that’s just it. In exchange of a new Martian-Earthling Peace accord they’re letting the Martians put a colony here provided they don’t kill any humans. The Martians agreed and MY Island was scheduled for designation for the colony! If we stay they’ll be allowed to kill everyone since nobody on there is human except me.”\n“Well that certainly does suck, but why not just move?”\n“WHAT!? That’s our home! Would YOU move from your own home?”\n“Eh…I suppose I can see your point. So what am I supposed to do though?”\n\nMoreau takes another drink and looks at you with dead seriousness.\n\n“I need you to get them all to FIGHT! I need you to get them all in touch with their animal instincts again! I know you’re more than just a werewolf. You’re the self-proclaimed Alpha. I need that viciousness, I need that aggressiveness, I need it ingrained into my people. I can’t do it. I’m not qualified, and I’d only make things worse. I can pay you all the money you want; our economy has always been good. If you like you could even live on the island and spend your remaining years there with nothing to worry about. You could mate with whoever you wanted, we could import whatever meat you wanted, or if you preferred…we could even make special arrangements just for you, to hunt living creatures. Anything…just please help us.”\n\nThis is pretty heavy shit. Moreau must be very desperate to come begging to a practical stranger. There’s no way he’s lying about this, you have heard some stuff lately about Martian-Human relations, though you don’t really pay attention to the news a lot. You can’t say Moreau’s offer isn’t appealing on some level, but as much of a badass you are, you’re not in your prime anymore. Taking on a shit load of Martians and training a bunch of genetic freaks of nature could be just a little out of your scope.\n",
  "page 45": "The Invaders: Martians\n\nMartians much like Human comes in many shapes, sizes and colors. They are a technologically advanced race which is amazing considering how stupid they actually are. It makes you wonder if natural selection even occurred on the dismal red planet.\n\nThe first Martian invasion was impressive since humans weren’t prepared for it. Unfortunately for all their advanced weaponry their medical science was probably in the fucking toilet…literally. They have to be the only galactic race of “conquerors” that lost a war because of dysentery. All the “War Machines” in the world couldn’t protect them from all the air born germs that infest humanity (They really are filthy when you think about it). You’d think that they’d take this information and try to combat it with…uh you know inventing fucking vaccinations and penicillin. But did they do that? Nope. They tried to invade again this time they figured if they never got out of their machines at all they’d be safe. Unfortunately in order to invade a planet you HAVE to have ground troops to do it. So while they blasted the shit out of the Earth again they couldn’t properly conquer it. So these geniuses spent the rest of the time arguing about what they should do until all their flying saucers ran out of fucking fuel and started falling out of the sky, crashing into shit.\n\nAt this point you’d think they’d just give up, but they didn’t. The next failed mission involved them stealing human women to breed with them. They figured two things:\n\nOne was that they could replenish all their soldiers again that they’d lost in the last two invasions. The second idea was they figured they could create a hybrid that was more resilient to human germs.\n\nThe plan was doomed to failure in its typical Martian idiocy and this was a particularly spectacular one that nearly wiped them out permanently as well as effectively destroying them as a potential threat.\n\nFirst of all the Martians had to get OUT of their machines in order to kidnap these women. Sure they finally developed protective suits at this point, but they were made of a thin and easily ripped material. Many Martians died attempting to steal away feisty housewives. Second of all they would’ve had to steal a lot more housewives than they did in order to replenish their severely depleted military (And male population in general) to say nothing of the fact they had to put up with the human women for at least 9 LONG months before they got a return on their “investment”. The third problem was for some reason it didn’t occur to them that the germs would still be ON these human women! Many Martians died after mating with these kidnapped housewives, not to mention an “Earth” plague hit the entire planet now. More dead Martians and lots of them. The kicker of all this, was most of the “hybrid” Martians that grew up tended to be very interested in their human heritage and would go back to Earth. (With their moms of course)\n\nThe only good thing that occurred was the survivors were now finally resistant to human germs. Little good it did now since half the planet died, and was in no position to invade anyone. (Luckily for them, humans were too busy fighting each other, or they would’ve surely been defeated had humans invaded Mars).\n\nThe Martians tried a few more stupid invasions later, but they never were really serious and by that time humanity had caught up to them technologically. (Thanks to salvaging the technology from all those immobilized war machines and flying saucers that fell out of the sky) Nowadays Martians are considered the intergalactic equivalent of rude hillbilly neighbors with lots of guns.\n\nThey bring a whole new meaning to term “REDneck”.\n",
  "page 48": "You take one look at Moreau’s citizens and shake your head. There’s no way you can whip these freaks into shape by yourself. Look at them, all peace and love and shit. There’s a damn giraffe man kissing a damn bear woman. It’s not right! You’re too disgusted right now; you have to talk to someone normal!\n\nYou go to the nearby swamp, where you see Gil catching a small lizard and eating it.\n\n“Well its good to see someone here, who’s not a pansy ass herbivore.” You say.\n\nGil looks up, perturbed at first, but surprised when he sees you.\n\n“Wolf? What’re you doing here?”\n“Same thing as you, Moreau offered to set me up for life, if I help him. Though I don’t see how that’s possible with the freaks I just met.”\n“I know, tell me about it. I can’t even get them to argue with me! I was calling them a bunch of ignorant land dwellers who should’ve been killed at birth like the freaks they were and they tried to do was hug me.”\n“Still don’t like surfacer dwellers eh Gil?”\n“Hell no! I wouldn’t even be here, but I was getting really tired of moving every five minutes because humans feel the need to build a factory near my home. At least here, I know that’s not going to happen and the freaks will know to leave me be.”\n“Assuming the freaks will still be here. The Martians will be taking over soon if we don’t do anything.” You remind Gil.\n“I know, I know. They would be even worse neighbors than humans assuming they would still let me live here. (Sigh) Looks like I’ll be moving again soon.”\n“Oh come on Gil, we gotta think up something. The Martians are a bunch of idiots. I can’t give up just yet.”\n“Ah I should’ve suspected. You’re here to prove you still got one fight left in you. The old Alpha Wolf syndrome.”\n“I’m not here just for that, but maybe that is part of it. So what the hell’s wrong with that?”\n“Nothing I suppose. It’s your life. I just think it’s a pointless and silly endeavor that gets you killed for no good reason.”\n“Oh fuck you Gil. We’re natural born killers, we’re designed to establish our dominance and be combative! You of all should understand that. You want to die an old fish in your sleep?”\n“Sounds about right. Look Wolf, I know you’ve always subscribed to natural law, survival of fittest ideology and I do too. But you take it to the fucking extreme that it’s ridiculous. Really I mean don’t you feel that in your elder years that you’d just like peace and quiet? I never picked fights for the hell of it. It didn’t make much sense. I mean shit, I’ve been fighting humans all my damn life, and I’m tired of it. I want to rest. I always just wanted to be left alone but the damn land dwellers wouldn’t leave me alone.”\n“Gil, I learned a long time ago, no matter how much you try, shitheads are going to bother you. You can be a recluse like you and Moreau or be an anti-social asshole like me. It doesn’t matter. Someone is going to fuck with you; someone is going to annoy you. All you can do is deal with it head on and make the best of it. What’re you going to do Gil? Move when the Martians arrive? Then move again when some humans build yet another factory by your new home and just keep going like that until you die? You got a chance here to pretty much live your dream of a relatively peaceful undisturbed life here. It’s not going to get any better Gil. All you gotta do is stand up to the Martians. Yeah, maybe you’ll get killed, but it’s better than constantly being on the run.”\n\nYour words have made sense to Gil. He can’t really argue with your logic. This place probably is the best he’s going to ever have it on this planet. He just needs to help get rid of the Martian threat.\n\n“Well Wolf, I guess either way this is going to be my last fight. Alright what should we do next? Because attempting to train the freaks seems like it’s doomed to failure.”\n",
  "page 47": "If Gil’s already given up, you see little point in involving him. He’s never liked land dwellers anyway. You call everyone to the center of the town.\n\n“Alright I got a lot to teach you and there isn’t much time. As you all know the Martians are coming here and they won’t be interested in peace and love. They’ll be taking bets on who can blast more freaks.” You say frankly.\n“That’s pretty judgmental of you. How do you know that they won’t accept us and live in peace with us?” one of the freaks asks.\n“Because that’s not the Martian way! In fact it’s not ANYONE’S way! Not anyone sane anyway! The only reason why you freaks are all love and peace and shit, is because Moreau played God with your genetics and socially engineered you all to be pussies. It’s not right! But despite my disgust for your way of life, I’m here to get you back in touch with your animalistic sides. Now it’s my idea that you could evacuate the town and your other small settlements, take to the jungles, and wage a guerilla war on the Martians. A lot of you are designed for it already. The Martians are poor tacticians and weak immune systems, so the jungle diseases could have…”\n\nAnd you realize you’re not convincing them.\n",
  "page 49": "The Creature: Gil AKA Gilqtzejeopleziqjadg’helixizrtylewv’rocrzs…\n\nGil’s real name is a mile long and unpronounceable like most members of underwater species. He doesn’t really care for the name “Gil”, but he resigns himself to the fact that you land dwellers can’t pronounce his real one.\n\nHe was pretty private, normally he’d just come to work, do his job and go back to his swamp, or lagoon, or whatever body of water he was living in at the time. (Never anyplace with salt water though, as it reeked havoc on his skin) As far as the “big name monsters” go, he was probably the one who socialized the least, mainly because he didn’t like land dwellers. He didn’t like land dwellers for several reasons, but even if they hadn’t been draining his swamps, pissing into his pools, polluting his lagoons, and over fishing his lakes, he didn’t like them before they did all that. While he didn’t like land dwellers, you didn’t take offense to it like everyone else did. You actually understood it. You don’t have anything in common with the Undead and you don’t like them. Gil was an aquatic being, there’s no real reason for him to like ANY land dwellers, since he didn’t have much in common with them. (Given that you can’t stand most of them half of the time, you couldn’t really blame Gil for his prejudices)\n\nYou and he never interacted much, but you did respect each other for each ones natural predator instinct.\n",

  "page 160": "You’ve just reconciled with your son you’re not leaving now, but you’re still on heightened state of agitation.\n\n“This is my father Wolf, and his…girlfriend Mary.” Lawrence says unsure of if that’s actually the case. You and Mary look at each other, shrug and nod silently in agreement that it is.\n“Wow, Lawrence, your family doesn’t keep to your own kind. Your Dad’s fucking a corpse and you’re fucking my sister. Wait, you’re also part human aren’t you? Sheesh, you Werewolves will fuck anything that isn’t another Werewolf! Can’t say I blame you though! HAR HAR HAR (BURP!) I’m kidding! I’m kidding of course. Relax. Hey Irena bring your pretty little tail over here and bring me some food too!”\n\nOkay you are REALLY close to losing it. Mary senses this and whispers to you to just calm down. It’s very difficult though. Meanwhile you see Irena bring Oliver some food, Lawrence isn’t paying attention as he’s talking to his children, but you notice Oliver is lecherously looking at Irena the whole time. Then he begins stuffing his bloated face when Lawrence turns back around.\n\n“Yeah, I’ll be staying here awhile Lawrence; I had a couple of job set backs. Might be awhile before I can find another one. Irena said it was okay.” Oliver says while food hangs from his mouth.\n\n\nYou knew it. You goddamn well knew it. Typical fucking Cat Person. Fucking sponge.\n\n“Sure Oliver, you’re family after all, your home is my home.”\n“Ah, you have my thanks Lawrence. My sister is so lucky to have such a highly motivated well to do man such as yourself. Don’t know why our family disapproved so much of you, but hey at least I was at the wedding, right Irena? There to give you away, right Irena?”\n“Um, yes Oliver.” Irena says nervously and quickly goes back into the kitchen.\n\nSomething is seriously WRONG here. You’ve hung around with some shady characters and known several creepy ones, and Oliver is just oozing with both traits. Even his sister doesn’t seem to like him; she seems more scared of him than anything. Like an abuse victim. You don’t understand why Lawrence is letting him talk like that. You ask to see Lawrence in the next room privately.\n\n“What’s up Dad?” he asks.\n“What’s up with you? Why are you letting Oliver talk shit like that?”\n“What Oliver? He’s harmless. That’s just how he is. Don’t pay any attention.”\n“Yeah well I’m having a very hard time doing that. Look fuck all my personal feelings about what you think of your relationship with Irena, but if that’s the woman you love, then you need to put Oliver in his place right now. I know damn well you HAD to inherit that trait from me.”\n“Dad I know your answer to everything is to kick everyone’s ass that looks at you sideways, but sometimes you have to let things go. Besides Oliver’s the only family member on EITHER side who supported our wedding you know. He even paid for it. He might make comments every now and then, but I know he’s supportive of us.”\n“Lawrence, I know about letting things go, I’ve been doing it all damn night, but I’m telling you I can sense that he’s up to no fucking good. He’s been staring at his sister’s tits and ass since he got here! It’s like he’s a psychotic stalker ex-boyfriend. I noticed Irena acting nervous around him, I’m telling you something weird went on between them and I don’t think it was consensual.”\n“Dad! You know what the fuck you’re saying?”\n“Hell yes I know what the fuck I’m saying. I’m saying he’s a fucking sicko and a moocher to boot. Doesn’t have a job and it’ll be awhile? You know what that translates into? A permanent squatter.”\n“Geez Dad, not all Cat People are decadent lazy inbreeders.”\n“Maybe not, but I’m saying HE is!”\n“I don’t think he is. Irena’s never told me that he’s ever done anything to her and I’m sure she would’ve, and as for the job thing, he’s just been having a string of bad luck. I mean come on; you should be able to identify with how hard the job market is right now. Look Dad, I hope you can put your bigotry aside, because I wanted you to stay awhile. Even stay here for the night.”\n",
  "page 163": "You’ve come this far, you might as well go a little further.\n\n“Alright…alright…I’ll stay around, but just direct me to your spare bedroom or something because I refuse to be in the same room with Oliver. His mere presence sickens me.”\n“Very well, just go upstairs turn left and straight ahead. It’s a blue room. I hope you’re in better spirits tomorrow, I want to talk with you some more.”\n“Yeah, well I hope you heed my warning Lawrence. See ya tomorrow.”\n\nYou head to the bedroom, which is a fairly large one. You stretch out on the bed thinking about everything that’s happened today. It was going pretty well until fucking Oliver showed up. He just makes you want to rip his guts out and hang him with them until his tongue turns purple and sticks out. You’ve never had to hold in your anger like this before, but you’re trying to change. For the sake of Lawrence you’re trying damn hard to change.\n\nAn hour passes and Mary enters the room.\n\n“So you can’t sleep, or am I correct in assuming you’re just isolating yourself so you don’t kill someone? Lawrence told everyone you were tired, but I knew better. You don’t like Oliver.”\n“Can you fuckin’ blame me? I mean come on Mary, you fuckin’ saw how he acts and how he is! Tell me you don’t find SOMETHING wrong with the fucker.”\n“Yeah, I know what you mean, I’ve been down there talking with everyone, and assessing him as well, and he is creepy. Especially with Irena.”\n“That’s what I tried to tell Lawrence, but he thinks I’m just a bigot.”\n“Well…you are, but that doesn’t mean you’re wrong.”\n“I just want to fucking do massive harm to that fucking cat…”\n”Whoa, easy there. We don’t actually know anything or have any proof of anything, he could just be harmlessly weird.”\n“I don’t need proof when I’ve got instinct! Arrgh! Why the hell isn’t Lawrence using his?!”\n“Calm down, you’re pretty tense, I think you need to work off some of that excess energy. Come on we worry about this tomorrow, for right now let’s continue to discuss those movie rewrites.”\n\nMary seductively hops on your lap and begins to kiss you all over.\n\n“Mmm, I was wondering if you still wanted to be with me after what happened back at the studio.”\n“What you mean that little argument we had? Please, I’ve heard worse from you remember? I know you were just doing a lot of prideful macho posturing, which is kind of sexy actually. Beside I know damn well you want to be with me again, your actions of changing your views on Lawrence have proven that, not to mention your body is telling me right now.”\n\nFour hours later, Mary is fast asleep, but you’re still wide awake. This pleasant diversion still hasn’t calmed you down. You slide out of bed to get a drink and go for a walk. On your way to the bathroom, you hear to whispering and mumbling from another bedroom. You listen closely.\n\n“You know Isis, you’re growing into a pretty young feline, thank God you take after your beautiful mother.”\n“Thank you Uncle Oliver, but why’d you wake me up?”\n“Just to tell you that and to play a game with you. You see me and your mother used to play a game when we were younger, but it was a secret game. We didn’t tell anyone, and you can’t tell anyone either, especially not your Dad.”\n“Um I don’t like the way you’re rubbing my leg Uncle Oliver...”\n“But that’s how the game is played, now let me just…”\n\nYou immediately burst through the door; Oliver’s fat frame is lurching over Isis when he turns his head in your direction. His eyes wide open like a deer caught in the headlights.\n\n“YOU’RE DEAD, YOU SICK PIECE OF SHIT!” you bellow and grab Oliver and throw him against the wall. Isis goes running and screaming from the room while you pound Oliver’s face into a bloody pulp. He tries to bat you with his claws, but they don’t even phase you, you’re too angry and you’ve been wanting to do this all fucking night. You throw him out of the room and into the hallway where you kick the hell out of him as he coughs up puke and blood. Mary arrives wondering what’s going on.\n\n“WOLF! STOP!”\n“NO! He was trying to molest Isis! I caught him right in the fucking act! I knew I was fucking right!” you bend down and speak in his ear. “And I’m gonna make sure you don’t ever try that shit on my granddaughter again, you fuck!”\n\nYou begin shredding his balls and dick into pieces and howl of pain is sounded throughout the house, Tom at this point has woken up, but Mary takes him back to his own room and tells him to stay there.\n\nNow you’re lurching over Oliver’s bloody body ready to deliver the killing strike, when Lawrence and Irena arrive from downstairs. They look at you, they look at Oliver, then Irena says something you don’t expect, but the look in her eye doesn’t entirely surprise you.\n\n“Do it Wolf.”\n\nAnd you do, you drive your claws deep into his throat effectively decapitating him. After the deed is done, you and Lawrence dump the body (and head) in a nearby woods where nature can take care of it. Lawrence then speaks.\n\n“When Isis told us what happened exactly, all I could think about is that I should’ve listened to you. I’m a fucking idiot, and failed you and my children.”\n“Look nevermind all that now son, what’s important is the problem has been dealt with. YOU, just be on guard more in the future. Remember, you’re the protector of this family, you have to suspect everything and everyone. If something doesn’t feel right, trust your fucking instinct, its never wrong. Let’s get back home, I gotta wash this cat blood off of me, I think he pissed on me too, ugh.”\n\nThe following day you decide to leave, Lawrence wants you to stick around, but you tell Lawrence he needs to spend time with his family right now, not you. This time he listens to you. You and Mary get on your Harley, while Lawrence, Irena, Isis and Tom all say their good byes to you.\n\n“Bye Grandpa!” Isis and Tom say in unison.\n“Bye you two. Remember, if someone starts trying to do something you don’t like to you, scratch their eyes out!” you reply patting them both on the head.\n“Thank you Wolf, for what you did…you don’t know how much it means to me…”\n“Think nothing of it, Irena, but you’re welcome.”\n“Bye Dad, I do hope we’ll see you again.”\n“You will.”\n\nYou start up the cycle and you and Mary zoom off.\n\nOn the trip home Mary rests her head on the back of your shoulder while holding you and giving you a bit of a hugging squeeze every now and then.\n\n“So are we going to actually get to those rewrites when we get back home, or are we going to just fuck our brains out again?” you ask Mary jokingly.\n“How about we do the latter, I don’t think the movie needs any rewrites now.”\n”What?! Dammit I told you I’m not playing that cranky old grandpa part!”\n“Why not? You do an excellent job of it in real life.” Mary taunts.\n“Hey don’t joke like that! I got a public image to maintain!”\n“Ha ha! Don’t worry; we’re still making the changes. Your image of being a distrusting combative asshole will be maintained…and don’t ever change that trait.” Mary says while kissing you on the cheek.\n\n“No need to ever worry about that Mary, some things will never change.”\n",

If you ever want to see me, that’s fine, but I can’t deal with this aspect of your life.” You say and go back into the dining room.\n“Mary come on let’s go we gotta work on that movie thing.”\n‘We’re leaving?”\n“Yeah, come on!”\n“Alright calm down!”\n\nWhen Lawrence enters the room, Oliver feels the need to make remarks again.\n\n“Hey Lawrence your Dad here really bosses around his woman, I hope you didn’t inherit that trait from him. When I gave her away I was hoping it would be to a gentleman, not a barking tyrant.”\n“Oliver, why the fuck did you give your sister away anyway? Was it because she was so repulsed by your appearance? Or was it because you were too much of a fucking loser to adequately provide for her?”\n\nYou just set it off in this motherfucker.\n\n“What the fuck did you just say, you fucking mangy dog?”\n“Too complicated for you? Okay. I SAID YOU’RE A FUCKING SICKO INBREEDING DRAIN ON SOCIETY! Just like your whole fucking race! You’ve been ogling your sister all fucking night while shoveling that food in your fat face!”\n“Fucking racist! You’re a narrow minded racist!” Oliver screams.\n“Yeah? Well I’d rather be that, then a sick incestuous piece of worthless shit like you.”\n“Fuck you!” Oliver shouts and throws a fork at you. You dodge it and jump over the table. Oliver’s in poor physical condition and you easily put him in poorer physical condition; that is until Mary, Lawrence and Irena get you off of him. Only Mary is strong enough to hold you back.\n“Get him out of the house!” Irena shouts as the furballs go running off to hide from the mayhem.\n“Yeah, stick up for that fat floor rug! Just shut out the past like it didn’t happen, right?”\n“Dad, stop!”\n“Wolf, calm down!” Mary says.\n“Ignoring the problem ain’t gonna make it go away Lawrence. I thought you were smarter and more perceptive than this. I hope you realize soon, for your kids’ sake.”\n\nYou take your leave, with Mary apologizing quickly to Lawrence and Irena and running after you. Oliver’s fat ass is still unconscious on the floor bleeding profusely. When you get to your bike, Mary is about to say something to you, but you interrupt her before she can start.\n\n“Mary don’t even start, because I’m not fucking wrong on this. You fucking saw him and how he was acting, don’t tell me you didn’t think he was a piece of shit pervert too.”\n\nMary looks at you and nods. She can’t help but agree with you. She’d know the signs; after all she was married to that equally depraved fucker, Frankie.\n\n“But Wolf, shouldn’t we try to do something else? I mean…”\n“What else can we do Mary? I already said what I thought and kicked Oliver’s ass. Lawrence and Irena are going to have to take it from there. If I meddle anymore it’s just going to make things worse, if you meddle, it’ll just look like you’re siding with me. Its Lawrence’s family, it’s his life, it’s his choices, he’s gotta be the one to sort it out. Hopefully he makes the right one. Come on Mary let’s get out of here.”\n\nMary hops on the back of your bike and you zoom off. On the trip home Mary rests her head on the back of your shoulder while holding you and giving you a bit of a hugging squeeze every now and then. It’s not really spoken, but it’s apparent you and Mary are back together again, and hopefully Lawrence listens to your warning so you can someday reunite with him again as well.\n",
  "page 189": "You limp over to Frankie while he’s recovering and land a few well placed strikes, even ripping off some of the back plating. It’s no good though; Frankie’s still got a lot of fight in him. He turns around, grabs you by the throat and begins to squeeze the shit out of it, raising you off the ground. Igor who’s dying makes one last effort to avenge his last blunder.\n\n“For my brother Vic!” he yells and fires his weapon at you one last time. He can’t miss at this range and your death is instantaneous.\n",
  "page 222": "Eh, you let it slide this once, Mary can’t really help being so ignorant of a Werewolf’s pride, she’s just a fucking patchwork of corpse parts, besides you need the money from this job, and who knows, maybe you can jump start your career again…\n\nBut there’s still no way you’re going to play in this movie the way it is! Time to turn on that charm.\n\n“Mary, look I know you mean well and all, but come on, you can’t seriously expect me to play this character! It’s insulting! Make it a comedy if you must, but make a dark one at least, not some family shit. Maybe I’m some fucking relic of the past trying to hold on to days gone by, but just about all I got left in this shitty world is my balls and my pride and I’m not losing either of them!”\n\nMary stares at you a bit, then she addresses the wolfings.\n\n“Alright you guys that’s a wrap for today! I’ll call you back when I need you, there’s going to be some script rewrites, and before someone bites my head off, don’t worry nobody’s lost their jobs.”\n\nAfter the set is completely clear, Mary addresses you and strokes your facial fur.\n\n“That was a very passionate little speech you just gave, and almost halfway civilized for you. I especially liked the part about your balls.” At this point she gently caresses the twins with her other hand. “Mmm yes, I don’t think I’d like you to lose those either, or THIS!”\n\nAt this point Mary grabs your big fully erect dick.\n\n“How about you and I discuss those script changes now, Wolfie?”\n“Alright, but its going to be hard for you to talk with your mouth full…”\n\nFour hours later, you and Mary have expended your sexual energy and are in a more talkative mood.\n\n“…and that’s how I think the movie should go.” You finish explaining.\n“Actually that’s not a bad idea; I’ll certainly incorporate some of the changes you suggested. See, and that’s why you’ll always hold a place in my heart, Wolfie.” Mary says lying next to you.\n“Well, the patchwork heart that was given to you anyways Mary.”\n“Damn Wolf, you were doing so well there for awhile and you revert right back to asshole mode.”\n“It’s a gift.”\n“Hmm, it’s also why you’re all alone.”\n“So what? I’ve always been a loner.”\n“And you’re happy living like that?”\n“Its worked pretty well so far, don’t see any reason to change now.”\n“Oh come on, surely you’d like someone around as opposed to the fast ass girls I hear you still bed every now and then.”\n“What? You mean like a wife? Yeah right! Tried that remember, you were part of the reason why I ultimately got divorced…ah fuck it. I was having problems with that bitch and fucking around on her before we started seeing each other. Nobody’s fault except my own for being stupid enough for getting married in the first place.”\n“Well maybe you just made the wrong choice in woman…”\n“No, I didn’t. I made the wrong choice period. I wasn’t meant to be married, and it’s not the idea of just fucking one female forever, I just value my freedom too much.”\n“Well I don’t see how you can be happy without someone special in your life.”\n“Jesus fuckin’ Christ, Mary what is with you getting all into my fucking business? What about you? You ain’t married and you seem to be doing alright! …Or are you trying to tell me something?”\n\nMary looks at you with a solemn expression on her face and touches your hand.\n\n“Wolf, things are different for me now. I spent years searching and while I’ve had lots of exciting and pleasant experiences in my life, but I’ve never felt as close to someone as I have during our time together. I might be made up of parts, but I’ve always felt a piece was missing when I wasn’t with you. No matter where I was, you were always in my mind.”\n“Oh so that’s what this is huh? You’re feeling that something is missing in your existence so you figure you can just waltz back into ol’ Wolf’s life because hey he doesn’t have anything going on and pick back up where we left off? Fuck that, I can say you literally and figuratively screwed the pooch on that one, baby. You ended up running off with that half a fag Dracula while I was getting all my shit taken away from me by my bitch ex-wife and sued by your goddamn no talent father!” you say and move your hand away.\n“It was a confusing time for me Wolf! You know how I was, I had all these hormones injected into me and I was initially created for the sole purpose of being a sex toy! Yes, I managed to overcome, but I couldn’t fight all of my initial feelings, I was also so curious about everything and anything! Dracula was a well traveled person and yes he WAS charming, I learned a lot while I was with him. I saw the world and more. You think I wanted to leave you? I loved you! Yes and I know you find that hard to believe that something Undead is capable of love, but I LOVED you!”\n“Oh yeah, well if you loved me so fucking much, why the fuck did you leave?”\n“Because I had to! You were stuck in your own little world, never wanting to mix with anyone, never wanting to do anything that didn’t interest you, I’m a social being! I need to be around people. I don’t know, maybe its because I was originally made to just stay locked in that fucking castle for that sicko Frankie and I spent so much time alone that I never wanted to be alone again. If stayed with you EVEN after your divorce and mine, I would’ve been trading a neglective mate, for an overly possessive one. Come on Wolf I know you. You would’ve been alienating everyone who looked at me with a hint of attraction. I had to let you go so I could be independent and find myself.”\n“Yeah, yeah, you’re the fucking victim as always right Mary? Tell someone who gives a shit. Fuck this, I’m not working on this movie with you, I don’t care what rewrites you do. I’m out.”\n\nYou storm off, but as always Mary gets the last word.\n\n“I can’t be a victim, because you’ve already taken that job! You carry a chip on your shoulder the size of Gibraltar and act like the goddamn World owes you something, well it doesn’t! You can’t let shit go! It’s why you’re all by yourself! Okay Wolf, fuck me then, I was no good fucking cheating bitch that did you wrong. Fine. You talk to any of your children lately? At least the ones you know about? You got fucking sons and daughters Wolf and you’ve alienated ALL of them with your inflexibility and assholiness! Even Lawrence, who you once were so proud of remember? He was following in your footsteps remember? But what happened? He disappointed you by following his heart instead of YOUR bigotry!”\n\nThe name “Lawrence” is one you haven’t heard in a long time and one you hoped you’d never hear again. You have to stop yourself from seriously damaging Mary for even mentioning him. Instead you just slowly turn around and attempt to calm yourself.\n\n“Mary, you will NOT fucking utter that name again. He’s fucking dead to me. You got that? He’s as fucking dead as your fucking flesh! He’s not a son, he’s not a relative, he’s not a friend!”\n“Yeah, I knew you’d say something like that, I told LAWRENCE that when we talked the last time and it’s so sad because he’s always just wanted your approval.”\n\nWhat the hell? What is Mary doing talking to your fucking no good disappointment of a son who dishonored the family by marrying Irena…one of the Cat People.\n",
  "page 100": "“Here, I’m supposed to deliver this letter to you.” You say and hold it out to her.\n“What?! You break into MY Hive, kill my guards and face your imminent destruction all to give me a letter?!”\n“First of all, I’m not facing any kind of destruction, and Andre said it was important.”\n“Andre?! You were sent here by Andre?! That lowly fly? What the hell is he paying you with?”\n“Nothing actually, I was planning on getting something out of you, though in retrospect, it probably was a stupid idea given your personality…I can tell by your rhetoric of insects being the master race, it hasn’t changed. Just a WASP in another form eh Janice?”\n\nSeveral Ant guards enter the room, but Janice tells them to halt.\n\n“Hold on, I’m slightly amused by Wolf here. Yes, I remember you. Getting drunk, picking fights with everyone, sleeping with every woman that could stomach you; typical behavior of the lower class. Just proves that I’m right, we insectoids aren’t controlled by our impulses; we’re orderly and superior. Anyway, be that as that may, I might as well read the note…ugh, I’ll have to remember to wash my hands after touching this.”\n\nJanice takes the letter and reads it. She then begins to laugh.\n\n“Does this fool actually believe he EVER had a chance with me?! Oh that IS amusing, in fact I’m in a good mood, guards you can escort Mr. Wolf out alive. This lap dog can run to tell his master Andre that I’ll never ever be interested in such a common creature as him.”\n\nThere’s no way you’re going to just leave without retorting to her insult.\n",
  "page 188": "You’ll never be able to fight Frankie in this condition and in his updated status, you get an idea.\n\nYou go over to Igor who pathetically attempts to point his weapon at you. You easily grab his arm weapon and begin to pull the thing out its weakened socket. Blood spurts all over you and Igor finally dies from the loss of it.\n\n“I’m sorry Vic…my brother… (gurgle)” he sputters.\n“Hm, that explains his loyalty I guess.” You say to yourself.\n\nFrankie’s is attempting to recover from his own wounds, but you’re not going to give him a chance to do it. You point Igor’s arm at Frankie and manipulate the tendons inside.\n\nThe gun fires and you blast half of Frankie’s head off with a rain of silver bullets. The recoil causes you to fall to the ground and the heat from it burns the fur on your hands.\n\n“Holy shit that was fucking cool.” You say impressed.\n\nFrankie’s not dead yet though, he tries to get back up, so you just take the weapon and club him in what remains of his head with it until he stays down for good. You then tear him apart to make sure. You stand over Frankie’s body parts panting heavily. You can’t even give a victory howl. You’re too tired. The rest of the pack comes in, somewhat surprised to see you alive.\n\n“You’re alive!”\n“Of course I’m alive! No thanks to you! Where the hell were you assholes?”\n“Um…well we didn’t know if we should help since you got mad when we did it last time…”\n\nYou can’t even argue with them, you’re too tired to do even that. You only have the strength to do one more thing…\n\nYou head upstairs by yourself, back to the lab Frankie came bursting out of, its empty, but there’s another door in the room and you’ve got the impression that a certain doctor is behind it.\n\nYou open the door to a small room with a bunch of big computers hooked up to a brain in a jar…\n\n“Vic, you really are a shitty Mad Scientist, you couldn’t even come up with a better way to prolong your life.”\n“Frankie! Igor! Get in here! NOW!”\n‘They’re dead just like you’ll be soon and should’ve been before.”\n“Erm…Wolf! Hold on! Come on, I can’t do anything to you! Hasn’t there been enough killing for one day!?\n“Not yet.” you say and take Victor’s brain out of the jar.\n\n“NOOOOOO….” Is the last thing that comes out of the loud speakers as you crush the brain under your foot.\n“NOW there’s been enough killing for one day.” You say.\n\nIts over. You won, and you fucking hurt like hell. You stagger back downstairs. Where the wolflings look at you expectantly.\n\n“Did you kill him?’\n“Yeah, and it was hardly worth the effort.” You reply.\n“What are we going to do now?” another asks.\n“Well I don’t know about you, but I’m going back home to rest.”\n“But aren’t you taking us to raise hell somewhere else? We want to do more werewolf stuff!”\n“Raise hell? You fuckers made ME do all the damn work! I killed every single member of this fucked up family all by my damn self! As far as I’m concerned I’M the only werewolf here! The rest of you are fucking lapdogs at best! I’m not leading any of you anywhere until you go prove otherwise…no fuck that. I don’t want to see ANY of you again! Well except Ginger. You know where I live baby. When you don’t want to hang around with these neutered pups, come see me.”\n\nUnsurprisingly Ginger comes with you immediately.\n\nYou and Ginger get back on your Harley and head home. You’re now convinced that you’re the last of a dying breed. Today’s youth are fucking spoiled. Still, you got to prove that you’re still the baddest ass Alpha Wolf this world is ever going to see, and it’ll be a long time before the world sees an Alpha Wolf like you again.\n\nThat is until Ginger has a litter of cubs…\n",
  "page 103": "“I don’t think you’ll be taking me anywhere.”\n“Oh and why not?”\n“Because…well let’s just say, I’d tell you, but only in private.”\n“Save your veiled threats, I’m not impressed.”\n“It’s not a threat. I suggest you listen to my proposal.” You say all of this calmly with no malice in your voice. Janice gets a little nervous, but attempts to cover.\n“Alright fine, I’ll humor this mammal! Guards leave us, I’m sure I’d be able to handle this dog if he tries anything.”\n\nAfter the guards leave Janice backs away from you, close to the window in case she has to make an escape. She’s obviously intimidated by you, which is good.\n\n“We’re alone, speak.”\n“Well, it’s just occurred to me that you’re talking a lot of rhetoric, but not doing a whole lot about it. A so called Queen would be mating with SOMETHING to produce offspring. Surely you could’ve used Andre for such a purpose, even if he was a so called lower class bum. As long as they’re bugly and indoctrinated to the insect cause you shouldn’t have any problems right? In fact I question this whole insect supremacy thing. While I don’t doubt that YOU think you’re superior, I wonder if you feel that way about THEM. I think you’re just using THEM, to make your life more comfortable, and their dumb enough to believe your lies because they’re a bunch of good little Ants that mindlessly follow a hierarchy because that’s what they know best. However, they have been exploited in the past, namely by humans in their little wars. I don’t think they’d like to be suddenly reminded that something similar is going on here, because after all, when it comes down to it, you’re not really one of THEM, you’re just a half freak insect human who’s taking advantage of the situation. You’ve been lucky to get away with it so long, without any return investment on your part.”\n“…Okay, assuming that’s all true…and I’m not saying it isn’t…what are you proposing?”\n“It’s pretty simple. I delivered the letter to you; I expect a little something for it.”\nJanice buzzes displeasingly, but she realizes she has little choice. She goes over to a wall safe and hands you everything in it.\n\n“Okay, you’ve got your money, now get out of here!”\n“Thanks, now what do you want me to tell Andre?”\n“Andre? Tell him to fuck off! I still don’t want anything to do with that bum!”\n“You know, maybe I’m keeping quiet about your scheme, but that doesn’t mean your Ant slaves won’t catch on eventually. Maybe you should take precautions by considering Andre’s offer, just some free advice.”\n“You’re kidding right?”\n“Not at all. What’s the big deal? You’re both hideous bug freaks. Doesn’t seem like you’d be that picky at this point in your life…”\n“I am NOT hideous, I have a condition! And I’m just waiting for the right man. What about YOU? You’re not exactly Mr. Universe!”\n“Janice…give it up. No bloodsucker is going to EVER want you. Not when there are all those young human girls to seduce and consume. Not to mention the eternally youthful Vamp girls. I think its time you lowered your standards. And as for your comments to me, I’m a guy; the lowering of my standards doesn’t apply to me. Maybe it’s sexist and all that unPC shit, but that’s the way the world works. I could get old as fuck, and still be banging teenagers. All I need to worry about is being able to get it up. And since I’m the Alpha Wolf, that ain’t a problem.”\n“You know Wolf, I’ve always heard about your so called legendary prowess in the bedroom, but I’ve always questioned it. I can’t help wonder if you yourself have done a lot of talking, but not actually doing. Perhaps you’ve spread all those lies yourself eh?” Janice taunts.\n",
  "page 224": "“So you had me in mind eh? Well that proves it. You think I’m a joke because that’s how you wrote the character.”\n“What? No! I just…”\n“I see your time with that bloodsucker was well spent. Learning how to exploit and leech right? Look maybe you can pull this shit with those puppies over there, but I ain’t fucking one! I don’t need the money that badly. I’ll go fucking live my twilight years in the forest and DIE there as nature probably intended. I don’t need this shit.”\n\nAs you turn to leave, Mary shouts at you.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right go on leave Mr. Lone Wolf! You’ll fucking die alone, you stubborn bastard! I tried to help you! Erik tried to help you and you don’t appreciate any of it! That’s why none of your children speak to you and…”\n\nYou run back over to her and slam her into the wall. You stare at her face to face as she struggles to get free. She’s strong, but you manage to keep her pinned. She really pissed you off and you were already pissed off to begin with.\n\n“Fuck you, and fuck Erik! You two don’t know shit about me, never did. I’m through with the pair of you! In fact I think I’ll be taking something with me since you’re so worried about me being alone…”\n\nYou release Mary and go over to the wolflings who look a little worried that you’re going to cause harm to them. Many of them cast their eyes downward.\n\n“Hey, you want to be REALLY tough? You want to really raise some hell? Come with me. If you want to stay under the thumb of this patchwork dead bitch and be exploited and mocked, stay here.\n\nYour statement alone convinces all of them. They all follow you, even the one you made an example of. Mary attempts to call everyone back, but it’s useless, you’ve taken control of the pack and they’ll do what you want now.\n\nAnd right now you want to get into a fight. You think about all the people and creatures that wronged you in some way and only two of them keep coming to mind consistently.\n\nOne is that fucking Dr. Victor Frankenstein. If it wasn’t for him, Frankie and Mary wouldn’t have been created in the first place which also means you wouldn’t have gotten yourself into trouble all those years ago. You wouldn’t have had to put up with his “children” taking jobs away from you. Not to mention he sued you once.\n\nBut the one who you REALLY despise, is that bisexual bloodsucker. Fucking Dracula or Vlad, or whatever the hell he’s calling himself these days. The disgust you have for him and the reasons are too numerous to list here.\n",
  "page 102": "Just as the Ant guards are about to take you away, you speak up.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right take me back to my master. We all got masters right? Just like you Ants have yours. Tell me how’s it feel serving some demanding bitch.”\n“She is our queen, mammal, she has every right to demand from us.” The guard says unemotionally.\n“See? Order! Everyone knows their place! Purity!” Janice adds.\n“Some purity! You’re not even an Ant! Hey, you Ants even think of that?! She’s not even one of your kind, and you serve her?”\n“She understands our plight. She is an insect, like us. Our own Queen was destroyed a long time ago, we were directionless when she died, we were assimilated and exploited by you mammals soon after. The Wasp Queen has made arrangements so that shall never be ever again!”\n“Hey that was the humans, not me.”\n“Doesn’t matter! All you mammals are alike!” the guard snaps.\n“Guard stop arguing with this fool! He’ll never understand! Wolf I suggest you stop barking, or I shall change my mind of letting you go!” Janice says, she sounds a bit nervous about your line of questioning though.\n\n“Yeah, I guess you’re right, all mammals are alike, I mean look at Janice, she’s acting just like the rest of us. Ordering you around, living on your hard work.”\n“Shut up Wolf! Guard, I changed my mind! Kill this furball!”\n“When I said Janice wasn’t your kind, I didn’t mean the fact that she was a Wasp, I meant the fact that she NOT an insect! I mean look at her, she wasn’t born that way! YOU were born an ANT! She became a half Wasp freak due to a failed human experiment!”\n“Well we know that, but still…”\n“Still nothing! She’s just using you for whatever twisted purpose she has and to make life easy for herself, just like she did when she was human! Think about it, who does all the work around here? It looks like you Ants! She only has you around because no human wants to work for her! AND even if she WAS all for making things better for insect people why is she so against Andre? Shouldn’t HE be allowed in too? I mean sure he’s a half freak, but so is Janice! Sounds like a double standard to me!”\n“The mammal has a point…you really aren’t one of us, in any sense of the word. A Queen is supposed to breed to keep the colony alive, in all these years, you haven’t even made that attempt, you’ve just been telling us what to do with promises of a so called glorious future for our kind.”\n“Um, I haven’t found the right guy…erm…Well what the hell do you want me to do mate with a pathetic mammal? All you Ants are female, and it’s not like there’s exactly any Male insects around!” Janice says trying in vain to find excuses.\n“There’s Andre.” You remind everyone.\n“Yes, there’s Andre. Granted he might be part human, but then as Wolf pointed out, so are you. We would look past that though since the children of such a pairing could be indoctrinated to…”\n\n“Silence! I will not fuck Andre! Andre is unfit!! He’s a disgusting insect, who belongs in the trash! Now you Ants know your fucking place and kill this asshole! Your place is to serve your superiors!” Janice says in anger.\n\nThat statement didn’t go over to well. The Ant guards begin to look at Janice and click their mandibles. They then advance on her.\n\n“What’re you doing?! Stop! I command you! OBEY!”\n\nJanice’s orders go unheard, she attempts to escape out the window, but one of the guards grabs her legs before she can take flight. She stings one of them, but is ultimately ripped apart. There’s bug guts and blood all over the place. The Ant guard you were speaking to earlier addresses you.\n\n“You can take whatever you like from this mansion; it was never our style, just more of Janice’s human vanity at work. We prefer the tunnels we’ve built Thank you for opening our eyes to reality. (Sigh) We wish it hadn’t been true though, now we don’t have any purpose once more, as strange as it may seem we prefer to serve in a hierarchy, it’s just our nature.”\n“Hmm, can’t argue with nature. I know I for one, would love to be stalking humans on the foggy moors, but adaptation can be a bitch. I do have an idea though….”\n\nYou gather as much money and valuables you can from the Mansion and head back to the bar where Andre’s been waiting, he buzzes excitedly.\n\n“Wolf! You’re back! So is Janice is interested?!”\n“She’s dead, but that’s not important…”\n“She’s dead?! What!? What happened?! But she was my love and...”\n\nYou smack Andre upside the head and then shove your paw in a nearby patron’s beer to wash it. “Hey!” the patron says and then sees you scowl causing him to retract his statement.\n\n“Andre shut the fuck up and listen, I got you a better deal! You’ll be set for life, with all the sugar and whatever else you want. You know all those Ant guards, Janice had? Well they’re all willing to serve YOU, under a couple of conditions. You’re in charge, but you can’t think yourself inherently superior, you have to understand that you need them. You can’t suddenly start thinking you’re better than THEM just because you’re technically the king.”\n“Really? Well, yeah sure I can do that. Being a fly has made me pretty humble. I’ll be grateful more than anything.”\n“Okay second, TAKE A FUCKING BATH! Stop smelling like a garbage dump!”\n“Take a bath? Gee I dunno, that’s a pretty big step Wolf.”\n“You goddamn well better, if you want to score with all the Ant bitches there.”\n“WHAT?! Are you serious?!”\n“Fucking dead serious. None of them have ever mated, given that in the past only the Queen is supposed to, but now most of them want to feel what its like before they die. Hell, some of them hold out hope that they’ll produce offspring, to make their race thrive again. So, what’s it gonna be? A shit eating bum, or a smooth pimp Superfly that gets to be serviced by a bunch of virgins?”\n\nAndre doesn’t even answer; he just thanks you quickly and runs out the door. You doubt if you’ll ever see him again.\n\n“Lucky bastard.” You say as you sit down and order a drink with your newly gained loot.\n",

I especially liked the part about your balls.” At this point she gently caresses the twins with her other hand. “Mmm yes, I don’t think I’d like you to lose those either, or THIS!”\n\nAt this point Mary grabs your big fully erect dick.\n\n“How about you and I discuss those script changes now, Wolfie?”\n“Alright, but its going to be hard for you to talk with your mouth full…”\n\nFour hours later, you and Mary have expended your sexual energy and are in a more talkative mood.\n\n“…and that’s how I think the movie should go.” You finish explaining.\n“Actually that’s not a bad idea; I’ll certainly incorporate some of the changes you suggested. See, and that’s why you’ll always hold a place in my heart, Wolfie.” Mary says lying next to you.\n“Well, the patchwork heart that was given to you anyways Mary.”\n“Damn Wolf, you were doing so well there for awhile and you revert right back to asshole mode.”\n“It’s a gift.”\n“Hmm, it’s also why you’re all alone.”\n“So what? I’ve always been a loner.”\n“And you’re happy living like that?”\n“Its worked pretty well so far, don’t see any reason to change now.”\n“Oh come on, surely you’d like someone around as opposed to the fast ass girls I hear you still bed every now and then.”\n“What? You mean like a wife? Yeah right! Tried that remember, you were part of the reason why I ultimately got divorced…ah fuck it. I was having problems with that bitch and fucking around on her before we started seeing each other. Nobody’s fault except my own for being stupid enough for getting married in the first place.”\n“Well maybe you just made the wrong choice in woman…”\n“No, I didn’t. I made the wrong choice period. I wasn’t meant to be married, and it’s not the idea of just fucking one female forever, I just value my freedom too much.”\n“Well I don’t see how you can be happy without someone special in your life.”\n“Jesus fuckin’ Christ, Mary what is with you getting all into my fucking business? What about you? You ain’t married and you seem to be doing alright! …Or are you trying to tell me something?”\n\nMary looks at you with a solemn expression on her face and touches your hand.\n\n“Wolf, things are different for me now. I spent years searching and while I’ve had lots of exciting and pleasant experiences in my life, but I’ve never felt as close to someone as I have during our time together. I might be made up of parts, but I’ve always felt a piece was missing when I wasn’t with you. No matter where I was, you were always in my mind.”\n“Oh so that’s what this is huh? You’re feeling that something is missing in your existence so you figure you can just waltz back into ol’ Wolf’s life because hey he doesn’t have anything going on and pick back up where we left off? Fuck that, I can say you literally and figuratively screwed the pooch on that one, baby. You ended up running off with that half a fag Dracula while I was getting all my shit taken away from me by my bitch ex-wife and sued by your goddamn no talent father!” you say and move your hand away.\n“It was a confusing time for me Wolf! You know how I was, I had all these hormones injected into me and I was initially created for the sole purpose of being a sex toy! Yes, I managed to overcome, but I couldn’t fight all of my initial feelings, I was also so curious about everything and anything! Dracula was a well traveled person and yes he WAS charming, I learned a lot while I was with him. I saw the world and more. You think I wanted to leave you? I loved you! Yes and I know you find that hard to believe that something Undead is capable of love, but I LOVED you!”\n“Oh yeah, well if you loved me so fucking much, why the fuck did you leave?”\n“Because I had to! You were stuck in your own little world, never wanting to mix with anyone, never wanting to do anything that didn’t interest you, I’m a social being! I need to be around people. I don’t know, maybe its because I was originally made to just stay locked in that fucking castle for that sicko Frankie and I spent so much time alone that I never wanted to be alone again. If stayed with you EVEN after your divorce and mine, I would’ve been trading a neglective mate, for an overly possessive one. Come on Wolf I know you. You would’ve been alienating everyone who looked at me with a hint of attraction. I had to let you go so I could be independent and find myself.”\n“Yeah, yeah, you’re the fucking victim as always right Mary? Tell someone who gives a shit. Fuck this, I’m not working on this movie with you, I don’t care what rewrites you do. I’m out.”\n\nYou storm off, but as always Mary gets the last word.\n\n“I can’t be a victim, because you’ve already taken that job! You carry a chip on your shoulder the size of Gibraltar and act like the goddamn World owes you something, well it doesn’t! You can’t let shit go! It’s why you’re all by yourself! Okay Wolf, fuck me then, I was no good fucking cheating bitch that did you wrong. Fine. You talk to any of your children lately? At least the ones you know about? You got fucking sons and daughters Wolf and you’ve alienated ALL of them with your inflexibility and assholiness! Even Lawrence, who you once were so proud of remember? He was following in your footsteps remember? But what happened? He disappointed you by following his heart instead of YOUR bigotry!”\n\nThe name “Lawrence” is one you haven’t heard in a long time and one you hoped you’d never hear again. You have to stop yourself from seriously damaging Mary for even mentioning him. Instead you just slowly turn around and attempt to calm yourself.\n\n“Mary, you will NOT fucking utter that name again. He’s fucking dead to me. You got that? He’s as fucking dead as your fucking flesh! He’s not a son, he’s not a relative, he’s not a friend!”\n“Yeah, I knew you’d say something like that, I told LAWRENCE that when we talked the last time and it’s so sad because he’s always just wanted your approval.”\n\nWhat the hell? What is Mary doing talking to your fucking no good disappointment of a son who dishonored the family by marrying Irena…one of the Cat People.\n",
  "page 105": "You’re NOT going to let your cocksmanship come into question here! If this bug bitch wants your dick in her then that’s what you’re going to do! Janice senses it and smiles as she positions herself on the bed.\n\n“So are you gonna show me what you got, or are you just stand there and hold your dog dick.” She buzzes.\n\n“You know, I’ve fucked a lot of women. Humans, aliens, other werewolves, and even the goddamned undead so help me. Yeah, I’ve fucked just about everything that’s walked or crawled at one time or another, and now I’m here to fuck you Janice.”\n\nYou get down to it. It’s an “interesting” experience to say the least. You have to be careful due to her stinger, but its not too bad. Now if anyone asks if you’ve ever fucked a bug, you can honestly answer “Why yes I have!”\n\nAfterwards while she’s praising your abilities, you wonder if you shouldn’t stick around, might be alright to live in a mansion, you can ignore the Ants, since they seem to concentrate on their own business and all you’d have to do is keep her satisfied and just close your eyes. (You’d fuck her from behind, but there’s that damn stinger…)\n",
  "page 226": "Your recent dealings with Mary, have made you think about all the shit you’ve had to put up with from that no talent dickhead. No human has ever given you such trouble. You know he’s still alive. (Mad scientists always find ways of prolonging their lives somehow) That won’t be true for long though, if you get your way. You killed him once before. This time you’re going to make sure he stays that way.\n\nHe’s probably got whatever crappy inventions and experiments protecting his castle and from what you know, Frankie’s still living with his “Dad” as well.\n\nYou don’t give a fuck, you’ll kill him too. You figure you’ll be doing the world a favor as well as getting some satisfaction. Besides, you’ve got to show these wolflings what being a werewolf is all about.\n\n“All right you cubs! We’re going to go raise some fucking hell. We’re going to Frankenstein’s Castle. We’re going to rip the place apart brick by brick, and I’M going to rip Victor apart limb from limb.”\n“Erm…Castle Frankenstien? Isn’t that where Frankie lives?” one of the wolflings asks.\n“I heard he’s really powerful, didn’t he fight Dracula and win?”\n‘I dunno if we should mess with him.”\n\nYou can’t believe your ears! These snot nosed pups know nothing of their heritage! Back in the old days they would’ve been killed and eaten for such cowardice!\n\n“Goddammit are you Wolves or fucking Chihuahuas? Frankie’s a fucking pussy! I personally kicked his ass before and I’ll do it again all by myself if I have too! Now are you going to run with me and be a fucking Wolf or are you going to go back home with your tails tucked between your legs?”\n\nAfter looking at each other for awhile they all agree to go with you.\n\n“Good! Now I want all of you to transform into your wolf form too! I’m traveling with fellow wolves not humans!”\n\nJust before one of the females begins to transform, you stop her. She’s dressed in a short leather skirt and a tight white t-shirt that’s tied in the center and has long flowing brown hair. You can smell that she’s in heat. You hate to coin a pun, but she literally is one hot l’il bitch.\n\n“Erm, not you. You stay in your human form; I kind of like the whole teenage slut look you got going on. In fact you come here right now; you’ll be traveling on my bike with me.” You say.\n\nAs she slides in behind you and holds on, you ask her one more question.\n\n“So what’s your name?”\n“Ginger. What’s your name, you never did tell us.”\n“Wolf. Just Wolf baby. Remember it. You’ll be screaming it later.”\n\nDamn you’re so fucking cool, you think as you start up your Harley and ride ahead of the pack.\n\n(You’d probably be even cooler if these pups weren’t all riding those Japanese “crotch rocket” bikes, but that’ll have to be another lesson for another day)\n\nAfter a couple of days of riding, and a few “pit stops” with Ginger, you all eventually reach Castle Frankenstein. You park your bikes at the gate, and size the place up, which now looks a lot different. It looks like a damn Nazi fortress now, there’s guard towers and everything. It seems Victor has been keeping himself very busy in recent years.\n\nAs it begins to rain, a familiar voice calls to you from one of the towers.\n\n“Its you. Vic always knew you’d return one day. I never believed him though. I guess I owe him fifty bucks.”\n\nYou look up and see Igor, he looks different too. He has a lot of clumsy cybernetic implants, one of them being some sort of gun in place of an arm. More of Vic’s “handy work” no doubt. He’s still got that damn hump on his back though.\n\n“Igor? You still alive? I thought your ungrateful master would’ve just let you die of old age and get himself another assistant. I see he did a real good job of improving you though. Tell me, how’s it feel to be the real brains, never getting the credit and continuing to be a doormat?”\n“I’m happy with my lot in life. How’s it feel to be broke ass overgrown dog who’s trying to relive his lost youth?” Igor retorts back.\n“Don’t know yet. I’ll tell you before I shove that metal arm up your ass.”\n\nWell looks like the fight’s starting here.\n",
  "page 225": "“So you had me in mind eh? Well that proves it. You think I’m a joke because that’s how you wrote the character.”\n“What? No! I just…”\n“I see your time with that bloodsucker was well spent. Learning how to exploit and leech right? Look maybe you can pull this shit with those puppies over there, but I ain’t fucking one! I don’t need the money that badly. I’ll go fucking live my twilight years in the forest and DIE there as nature probably intended. I don’t need this shit.”\n\nAs you turn to leave, Mary shouts at you.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right go on leave Mr. Lone Wolf! You’ll fucking die alone, you stubborn bastard! I tried to help you! Erik tried to help you and you don’t appreciate any of it! That’s why none of your children speak to you and…”\n\nYou run back over to her and slam her into the wall. You stare at her face to face as she struggles to get free. She’s strong, but you manage to keep her pinned. She really pissed you off and you were already pissed off to begin with.\n\n“Fuck you, and fuck Erik! You two don’t know shit about me, never did. I’m through with the pair of you! In fact I think I’ll be taking something with me since you’re so worried about me being alone…”\n\nYou release Mary and go over to the wolflings who look a little worried that you’re going to cause harm to them. Many of them cast their eyes downward.\n\n“Hey, you want to be REALLY tough? You want to really raise some hell? Come with me. If you want to stay under the thumb of this patchwork dead bitch and be exploited and mocked, stay here.\n\nYour statement alone convinces all of them. They all follow you, even the one you made an example of. Mary attempts to call everyone back, but it’s useless, you’ve taken control of the pack and they’ll do what you want now.\n\nAnd right now you want to get into a fight. You think about all the people and creatures that wronged you in some way and only two of them keep coming to mind consistently.\n\nOne is that fucking Dr. Victor Frankenstein. If it wasn’t for him, Frankie and Mary wouldn’t have been created in the first place which also means you wouldn’t have gotten yourself into trouble all those years ago. You wouldn’t have had to put up with his “children” taking jobs away from you. Not to mention he sued you once.\n\nBut the one who you REALLY despise, is that bisexual bloodsucker. Fucking Dracula or Vlad, or whatever the hell he’s calling himself these days. The disgust you have for him and the reasons are too numerous to list here.\n",
  "page 228": "Its long over due and its time. You need to go fucking kill that bloodsucker or die trying. You need to prove that you are and always will be the baddest of the monsters. You also need to prove to these wolflings that they need to be proud of their fucking heritage and not play second fiddle to some overgrown leeches.\n\n“All right you cubs! We’re going to go raise some fucking hell. We’re going to Dracula’s Castle. We’re going to rip the place apart brick by brick, and every fucking bloodsucker in the goddamned place and I’M going to rip Fagula apart limb from limb, drive a stake in his heart, cut his head off and then shove his dick in his mouth!”\n\nThe Wolflings look very apprehensive about your suggestion, in fact they outright refuse.\n\n“You’re a fucking crazy old coot; if you think we’re gonna follow you to Dracula’s Castle! Fuck that, he’s got an army of bloodsuckers and ghouls and who knows what the hell else! We can’t win that Wolf! Can’t we just bust up a bar or something?” one of them exclaims\n\nYou can’t believe your ears! These snot nosed pups know nothing of their heritage! Back in the old days they would’ve been killed and eaten for such cowardice!\n\n“Goddammit are you Wolves or fucking Chihuahuas? Vampires have been taking OUR rightful place in the monster hierarchy for centuries! We need to set the fucking record straight on this shit! Now are you going to run with me and be a fucking Wolf or are you going to go back home with your tails tucked between your legs?”\n\nAfter looking at each other for awhile they all begin to leave and head back to the studio.\n\n“Oh fuckin’ fine then, play werewolf in a movie, but I can see I’m the only fuckin’ REAL Werewolf here, the rest of you are just goddamn overgrown dingos! Fuck this, I don’t give a shit, I’ll kill Dracula my own goddamned self. I don’t need anybody’s help!”\n\nYou get on your Harley and ride. You only make a few stops on your way; you’re completely driven to have your final showdown with Vlad. Finally after a few days of riding you reach Dracula’s Castle. The place looks exactly the same. You get off your bike and scale the high iron gate. As you jump down into the courtyard you half expect yourself to be overwhelmed by vampires, or even ghouls, but nothing happens. This is weird, there aren’t even any guards patrolling or even at the door. In fact it sounds like a party is going on inside. You hear lots of laughter and music. Suddenly someone comes outside and sees you. It’s some Vampire chick.\n\n“Ohhh, a Werewolf! Wow, I didn’t know any of you types were invited to the party; I thought Drac hated you guys. Well what’re you doing standing outside? Come on in the party’s just starting!” she says waving you in.\n\nA bit of a different approach than you were preparing for, but you enter. You entrance to the ballroom is immediately a big event. You’re the only Werewolf there. Everyone else is either a Vampire, a ghoul, or even a human “servant”. Everyone is staring at you, some with wonder and interest, most with hatred, a few in awe. Most probably haven’t encountered a Werewolf like you before. The staring would probably continue if another slightly out of place being didn’t come shuffling up to you to talk you in a friendly manner causing the bloodsuckers to go back to partying. It’s Im-Ho-Tep. You’re surprised to see him here.\n\n“Wolf?! YOU got an invitation to this thing? I can’t believe it! What the hell did you and Dracula kiss and make up?” he remarks with his scratchy sounding voice.\n“Not in this life time Teppy. What’re you doing here?”\n”Me? Oh you know Vlad, he’s always gotta put on a show. Likes to play up the whole royalty thing to the other bloodsuckers, so he always invites me to these things to prove he’s got connections or something since I was a Prince. I always keep telling him, it’s a meaningless title since the Egyptian Empire fell thousands of years ago, but he insists on flying me out here, making a big fuss and everything so what the hell, it’s not like I got anything better to do plus I get a kick out of watching the bloodsuckers get drunk and make idiots out of themselves, well that and I like to look at some of these Vamp chicks. Heh, guess that makes me a voyeur, but again what the hell, its one of the few pleasures I get in this world anymore. But enough about this dirty old man, what brings you here if you weren’t invited? Just randomly crashing the party?”\n“Sort of…I didn’t even know there was one…I’m here to kill Fagula.” You whisper quietly.\n\nTep’s eyes widen a bit under his bandages. He isn’t entirely surprised (At his age barely anything surprises him anymore) but he was caught a little off guard by your statement.\n\n“Wow Wolf…I can tell you’re really not joking about this. All I can say is… what took you so long? I thought this day would come long before now. Lost some bets because of it, oh well easy come easy go. Well you know your secret’s safe with me, though I suppose it won’t be a secret for too much longer! You’re still the craziest sonofabitch I know, but then you always did know how to liven up a party! Ha ha! Ol’ Vlad will probably be making his grand entrance soon, so just wait awhile. He threw this party for some kind of special announcement he has to make. I still got a bet with Erik that you would win if you and Drac ever got into a battle to the death. I’ll be hoping to collect that bet from Erik. Good luck!” Tep then shuffles off back to where he sitting.\n\nErik bet against you? Fucking little depressed shit! You’re going to have a little talk with him after all this.\n\nYou put your back against the wall, watching everyone while waiting for Dracula to arrive. An hour passes and you’re fucking sick of waiting, you don’t feel like waiting for him to make “an entrance”. You’re here to commit major mayhem on him, not listen to anything he has to say. While you’re surveying the place, you see a disheveled man peek out from a corner across the room and then slink back. That was Renfield, you’d know Fagula’s sycophantic bitch boy anywhere.\n",
  "page 106": "“Ha ha, sorry darling, but you’ll just have to wonder about the Legend, because you ain’t getting any of this, I guess I do have my standards too of a sort. I’ll be leaving now, so are you sure you don’t want Andre?”\n“(Sigh) Very well, I supposed his letter and stalking did prove genuine feelings. Tell him he can come by, but under one condition, he needs to take a fucking bath!”\n“Hmm, that’ll be a big step for him, but I’ll see what I can do.”\n“Yeah you do that, now get the hell out and never return!”\n\nYou gather your bike from downstairs where you left and leave with your money. When you get back to the bar Andre is hopping up and down waiting for your news.\n\n“Wolf! My letter! So what about it? Did she like it?”\n“She’s all yours Don Juan. Just take a bath before you approach her, that was her only condition.”\n“For her, anything! Thanks Wolf!” Andre says and runs out the door, leaving you to your drink.\n\nTime passes and you never see Andre lurking around town to bother you ever again, you figure he was living it up with Janice. The truth is much different as you soon find out later. Apparently Janice took your advice of keeping up appearances and she mated with Andre. Unfortunately for him, she killed him afterwards when she confirmed she was pregnant. She ended up giving birth to a bunch of little Wasp Flies. Disgusting little buggers and even more so when they grew up. Rotten attitude and equally rotten smell. No discipline whatsoever. They all eventually just became a gang of thugs calling themselves the “Yellow Jackets” who weren’t really interested in world domination so much as just petty criminal activity. Still, they were enough to keep the Ants from thinking that Janice wasn’t dedicated to the “Queen” role. Her place was secure. Meanwhile you live fairly well on your wealth from Janice. Everyone won.\n\nWell except Andre of course.\n",

  "page 55": "Robot Monster: Ro-Man\n\nIf there’s a bigger laughing stock of the galaxy, they must’ve died of shame, because it would be tough to top Ro-Man.\n\nRo-Man’s appearance is comical enough, but his personality takes him over the edge. For the most part he comes across as a typical unflinching bureaucratic tight ass that does everything his superiors tell him to the letter. However he does have his own ambitions and plans but he’s never competent enough to carry them through, since he can barely carry out plans of his superiors.\n\nThe incident that really destroyed his career was his failed invasion of Earth. After seeing that the Martians were so interested in the planet he convinced his superior called “The Great One” that they should invade it and that he should lead the invasion force. He said he just needed one ship to do it too. The Great One up to that point wasn’t too impressed with Ro-Man, but he indulged the fool and said he’d get a promotion if he pulled it off. Ro-Man had it all planned out, he was going to WIPE out humanity (As he liked to say) and make the way clear for his own people to colonize. He developed a big death ray and everything.\n\nWhat happened next made every failed invasion by the Martians look like military genius in comparison.\n\nAfter he did all his long winded speeches, the governments of Earth pretty much dismissed him for the long winded blowhard he was and ignored him as a potential threat. Ro-Man was incensed and unleashed his “Death Beam” and destroyed every Earthling on the planet…\n\nOr at least that’s what he thought happened, what really happened is when he turned the damn thing on he caused a power outage in his ship due to his bad wiring. After fumbling around in the dark for awhile and putting in a new fuse, his lighting came back on. Unfortunately for him not all the rest of his controls went back on line, but of course this genius didn’t think to make sure. When he checked his scanners they didn’t detect any life on Earth. It never occurred to him that all Earthlings hadn’t been WIPED out and his scanners just weren’t working.\n\nThinking he’d succeeded in his plan he landed on Earth to check things out, but instead of landing some place that would’ve tipped him off right away like a major city, he landed in the boondocks, where he ended up running into some very frightened humans who he figured were the only survivors on Earth. He spent the next few months chasing them around trying to kill them, until he started to get a hard on for some of the young human girls and then he was just trying to commit intergalactic rape at that point.\n\nWhat ultimately happened was some hunter caught sight of him and shot him in the ass with a heavy duty tranquilizer, thinking he was Bigfoot. (He wanted to capture him alive for a reward) When he woke up he was on the first saucer back home and deported in great shame. His planet was humiliated for his spectacularly idiotic failure. He was demoted several ranks after that and eventually just kicked off his planet and his citizenship revoked. Later he would go on to hire himself as a mercenary for other aliens often as an invasion consultant.\n\nNeedless to say he would get hired once and then have to find a new employer.\n",
  "page 109": "Nope, you need your freedom and even if you were going to be “kept” you’d make sure it would be by someone a lot hotter.\n\nAs you get up, you hear a lower buzz tone. Sounds angry. When you turn around you narrowly avoid a sting to your face. Definitely angry! Janice is now hovering in front and slightly above you preparing for another attack.\n\n“Oh ho! Mating then killing afterwards is it? Sorry, but I’m not a drone baby.” You say and grab her legs. You follow this up, by throwing her into the wall. While she attempts to recover and calls for her guards, you leap out the window, with your payment.\n\nIt takes awhile to get back because you left your bike back at the mansion which sucks big time. When you get back to town you immediately head for the bar. You don’t even get to drink your drink before Andre comes in stinks up the place.\n\n“Wolf! You’re back! The letter! Janice! What’s going on? Is she in love with me?”\n“Uh no Andre, she isn’t, but look on bright side, she has a nasty habit of killing after she mates with someone. Surely you didn’t want that, right?”\n“Yikes! No I suppose you’re right, I guess it was a pipe dream anyway.”\n\nAndre gets to the door and then turns back around.\n\n“Hey Wolf, how do you know she kills after she mates?”\n“Um, it’s an insect thing, I would’ve thought you’d known that Andre.”\n“Not all insects do that though, in fact that’s spiders! Now some in some insect species, the males die afterwards, but...”\n“(Sigh) okay I didn’t want tell you this but…”\n\nAndre looks at you expectantly.\n\n“I caught her fucking some other bug guy and when they were done, she stabbed him with her stinger, and ate him.”\n“Oh. Well okay then, thanks for looking out for me.” Andre says and leaves.\n\n“Yep, I am the Samaritan.” You say taking a drink.\n",
  "page 54": "You figure all you need to do is last until the drugs start affecting the Martians, Ro-Man’s not very fast so you can just stay out of his way. You don’t want to tire yourself out.\n\nThe problem with this is the Martians begin to get restless and angry at the “dodge and run” tactic, this is followed by loud booing. They came to see a fight not a dance!\n\nOne of the Martians decides to take matters into his own hands and blasts you with his incineration beam. They proceed to do the same to the rest of the inhabitants on the island.\n",

Poison soon follows, you’re paralyzed! You attempt to speak, but you can’t even do that. Janice hovers above you.\n\n“Well you were everything you claimed, it’s almost a shame that I have to kill you, but you’re right appearances have to be kept up. I can’t have a filthy dog like you dirtying up the house, what WOULD the Ants think?”\n\nAs the poison finally works on completely destroying your nervous system, everything goes dark and the last thing you hear is the buzzing laughter of Janice.\n",
  "page 229": "You push your way through the crowd and head towards where Renfield was lurking about. He isn’t far, you can smell him. You follow a long corridor and then turn the corner to see Renfield hobbling down another passage, you quickly knock him to the floor, turn him over and kneel on his chest. He attempts to struggle, but you’re still too strong for him.\n\n“Well, well, well, I’m surprised your faggot master still keeps you around. Shit, you smell terrible, I suppose along with your flesh rotting, and lousy hygiene in general, all those ass rammings have taken a toll on you eh? Where the hell is he?”\n”You! You’ve always been jealous of the master! Jealous of his wealth, his style and his beauty! You’re nothing, but a lowly animal!”\n“For someone who gets abused in every possible way, has no self respect, and is a filthy Ghoul, I wouldn’t be calling anyone a lowly animal. And you’re not really in the position to be pissing me off anyway. Now where the fuck is Fagula?”\n“The master is going enjoy killing you, especially tonight! Now he’ll be able to claim victory over TWO of his greatest enemies!”\n“What the hell are you blathering about?”\n“Oh you’ll find out…” Renfield smiles with a set of blacken teeth.\n“Yeah whatever, look last chance to…”\n\nSuddenly you feel a powerful crushing blow to the back of your head. It isn’t enough to knock you out, but you fall off of Renfield and roll over feeling very woozy. In your bleary vision you can make out the form of that cocksucker Dracula standing over you. Another figure stands there as well, you don’t know who they are, but they look somewhat familiar.\n\n“Wolf, I don’t believe I invited you to this party, but it was good of you to come anyway. It only makes festivities more enjoyable! I think you’ll give Jacob a good chance of testing himself. I was going to have him fight Renfield, but I’m sure you’ll provide much more of a challenge. You think you’re up for the challenge Jacob?”\n“Sounds perfect to me.” The other figure says and steps closer, and just before he kicks you in the head, you could swear it looks like Van Helsing, but much younger.\n\n“Sonofa…” you begin to say and then get your face kicked in, knocking you unconscious.\n\nTime passes and you wake up in a cage with silver bars. You see the figure that kicked you in the face on the other side, it is Van Helsing…or someone that looks like him since his name was Abraham, not Jacob. You find out soon enough, when he begins to speak.\n\n“Wolf, you’re up. Good. I’m anxious to test my new skills on you. Renfield certainly wouldn’t have been much of a challenge, but you should prove to be. Even my foolish grandfather couldn’t kill you. He couldn’t kill Dracula either, but then Dracula was always superior in everyway. I have no idea why he pursued such an idiotic quest of trying to kill Vampires, they really are the supreme life form on this planet and certainly the most lovely and sensual. Vladimir has shown me such pleasures since our time together.”\nYou shake your head and snicker. This must’ve been the “other” defeated enemy that Renfield was on about.\n“So, that’s how it is now? The Van Helsing bloodline finally defeated not through violence, but through seduction? Never thought I’d see the day come. I had my problems with your family and especially your father, but I could at least respect their dedication. You’re a fucking disgrace kid.”\n“On the contrary, I’m merely ensuring the survival of my family name. What was I supposed to do, carrying on some pointless family tradition of monster hunting, and get myself killed? Fuck that. I want to live forever.”\n“Yeah? Well you can scratch that plan, because when I get a hold of you, you’re going to be wishing you hadn’t turned into a fucking bloodsucker.”\n“(Sigh) Yes, Vladimir told me you were always one to make unimaginative threats, I’ll be more interested in hearing your howls of pain though, see you soon.”\n\nAs Jacob leaves you to your cage. You hear another voice in the room.\n\n“So…Vlad has now eliminated all his enemies, I guess I always knew he’d succeed.”\n\nYou see another holding cell, but one made of some kind of heavy duty unbreakable see-through plastic. The top of it has a ton of garlic hanging from it. Sitting and looking utterly defeated is an ugly distorted looking humanoid, who is yet another face you’re amazed to see. This revenge trip has just been one surprise after another.\n\n“Orlock? Heard you were dead.” you say.\n“I wish I was, unfortunately Dracula insists on keeping me alive…feeding me rats…tormenting me…reminding me of my shameful defeat by his hands…I’m proud of him.”\n“You’re happy that he’s torturing you? Sheesh, all you Undead are fucking masochists.”\n“I’m not happy that he’s torturing me you ignorant dog, I’m happy that he’s proven to be so ruthless, despite his foppish ways. I must admit I had my doubts about him when I first created him.”\n“Yeah, I see that really worked out well for you.”\n“(Sigh) True. But it’s my own fault for having a soft spot for him I suppose. I should’ve been more watchful of him. You’ll be lucky, he’ll just kill you, or rather have his new conquest Jacob do it.”\n“Nobody’s killing me, I’m getting the fuck outta here right now. These bars aren’t going to hold me.”\n“Won’t that be difficult Wolf? Seeing that the bars are made of silver?”\n“So fucking what? Doesn’t mean I can’t touch them! As long as the things aren’t going into my body they don’t mean shit! Thought you bloodsuckers knew that. See that’s the problem with you Vampires, always underestimating your enemies and being melodramatic. If Fagula and his bitch boys were smart they would’ve killed me when they had the chance. That’s what I would’ve done.”\n“You and I actually have more in common than you think. We both are the last of the old ways. I must admit that I too would’ve killed you immediately, rather than toy with such a dangerous enemy.”\n\nYou ignore Orlock and concentrate on the bars. You easily pry the silver bars open and step out of the cage; you then rip one of the bars out to take with you. Orlock looks at you with interest.\n\n“Why are you taking that?”\n“Because unlike you Vampires, we Werewolves try to learn everything we can about our enemies. I know for a fact that silver hurts you fuckers too, though you guys like to try to keep that shit quiet.”\n“Ah. Tis a shame we never clashed Wolf, you would’ve been a worthy opponent.”\n“Yeah? Well when I kill Drac, I can come back to finish you off too.”\n“Ha ha! Glad to see you have such confidence. However, if in the unlikely event that you do defeat Vlad, by all means come back and finish me off to put me out my misery. I would gladly welcome everlasting death at this point.”\n\nYou leave the room and find yourself in a corridor made of dull stone; you’re guessing you’re probably underground. Nobody’s around, but you can still hear the noise of the party above. You’re about to head back up when you hear a voice close by.\n\n“Psst! Wolf! Over here! Quick!”\n\nYou turn around and at one end of the corridor you see Mary. Now what the fuck is SHE doing here?! You rush over to Mary.\n\n“What the fuck are you doing here?” you ask.\n“Trying to prevent you from getting yourself killed, you stubborn macho asshole! When the Wolflings returned to the studio, I asked them where you went, and they told me, so I went after you. What the hell did you think you were doing coming here to kill Dracula?”\n“Just that! Kill his bloodsucking ass! How’d you sneak in here anyway?”\n”I didn’t, I got an invitation about a month ago to the party, so when I arrived I was expected. Then I heard you were taken down here by some of the guests.”\n“Oh I can see you and Drac are still chummy with each other, figures, all you Undead stick together. You’re probably here to help him not me!”\n”Goddammit Wolf, will you stop being so fucking paranoid! I wasn’t even going to this thing; the only reason why I’m here is because of you! Because maybe you don’t want to believe it, but I do love you, you’ve always only been the one to make me feel complete. After all the searching and traveling and trying to discover myself, it was our time together that I always held dear to me and stayed in my mind. Please, Wolf don’t go through with this, we lost a lot of years already; now that we’ve been reunited I don’t want to lose you permanently. This is isn’t worth it. You don’t have to prove anything. I’m familiar with the secret passages in this place, we could leave right now without any trouble.”\n\nMary’s face does show expression of concern, and her voice does display worry. She may or may not be telling the truth. If she isn’t then she’s done a good job of fooling you. However, even if she is telling you the truth, there’s something else at stake here, namely your principles and pride. You’d really hate to run from Dracula, especially at this point.\n",
  "page 57": "On most opponents this would’ve worked, unfortunately you seem to have forgotten that Ro-Man’s head is a fucking deep sea diver’s helmet! When you hear that “KLANG!” all you do is successfully knock yourself out. Ro-Man finishes you off, by breaking your back and keeping his promise of crushing your skull with his foot.\n",
  "page 58": "It’s going to taste like shit, but you bite down on Ro-Man’s arm ripping another chunk out of him, he drops you instantly and begins to feel the effects of his wounds as he bleeds severely from his arm and leg.\n\nAnd it looks like the drugs are taking effect too; you take a quick look in the stands and see them behaving strangely. A lot of them are giggling to themselves and hugging each other; some are just walking around in circles, and others are staring into the distance, pontificating about how they can hear the colors and taste sound. Fortunately none of them seem to have gotten more violent. Moreau’s freaks take their weapons away from them.\n\nMeanwhile Ro-Man is attempting to escape back to one of the saucers, limping and leaving a blood trail behind him. You attempt to finish him off, and tackle him to the ground, but he manages to bash you in the face a few times and gets you off of him. While you’re trying to recover, he escapes in the saucer.\n\nOh well, it’s another loss for him and another win for you. That’s the important thing.\n\nMoreau approaches you while you brush yourself off.\n\n“You did it Wolf! You saved the island and with a minimum of violence!” he says.\n“Unfortunately. Well at least I got to kick someone’s ass, even if it was Ro-Man.”\n“So do you want to stay on this island as part of our agreement? Remember I said we’ll make special arrangements for you.”\n\nYou look at Moreau’s freaks again who are now also tripping on drugs along with the Martians. The freaks and the Martians look like they’ve gotten very close to each other too. It looks like an orgy is about the break out.\n\n“Uh no! Living with your freaks would be bad enough, but adding Martians makes it even less attractive. I’ll be taking my reward in cash and leaving NOW!”\n\nMoreau shrugs his shoulders, goes back to his office and returns with a briefcase of money, which should be enough to support you for a long time. He flies you back to your home, where you head back to your run down cabin in the woods.\n\nIt may not be paradise, but it’s yours and you don’t have to put up with hippy peace freaks or idiotic drug addled Martians.\n",
  "page 51": "You shake your head and go back to Moreau’s house. Moreau is fiddling with some large old looking radio that contains a small black and white screen in it.\n\n“This is not going to work.” You tell him.\n“You’re giving up already?!”\n“Well I don’t know what to do, maybe if I had more time I could do something, but shit Moreau, you bred all the damn fight out of them.”\n\nJust then a voice comes on the radio and an image appears on the screen, it looks like some deepsea diver…oh geez it’s Ro-Man. The bureaucratic joke of the galaxy. Its fitting that he should be working for a bunch of idiotic Martians.\n\n“Dr. Moreau, the Martian colonist will be here soon! I hope you have made your evacuations of your island, or we shall WIPE you from it!” Ro-man says mechanically.\n“Ro-Man, please can’t we talk about this? I mean we’re peaceful, we won’t cause you any trouble!” Moreau says into his microphone.\n“No! My orders are clear! We will WIPE you from the island!”\n\nYou snatch the mic from Moreau and address Ro-Man.\n\n“Hey Ro-Man, you must be really scraping the bottom of the barrel if you’re working for Martians now. What happened, all the other aliens realize what a fucking joke you are?”\n“What!? Wolf?! What’re you doing there? We’re about to WIPE the island clean of all Earthlings and that includes you if you insist on staying there!” Ro-Man retorts.\n“I know Martians were stupid, but fuck, didn’t they realize what a goddamn joke you were when YOU attempted to take over the Earth?”\n“Shut up Wolf! Hey isn’t that island full of a bunch of pacifists? What’s a self-proclaimed badass Alpha Wolf doing there? You turn pussy too or are YOU scraping the bottom of the barrel by working for them?”\n“Fuck off Ro-Man! I got an idea, how about we settle this hand to hand combat? If I win you all go home, and if you win…well you won’t win, because you’re fucking moron.”\n“I don’t think so; we’re intent on colonizing this island in accordance with the new Earth-Mars cooperation treaty. Your pitiful attempts to stall for time are useless.”\n“Who says I’m stalling for time? I’m just saying I could kick your ass! You think I give a shit about this island? I’m just here to see if I got one more fight left in me, I was hoping for more of a challenge, but you’ll have to do. Of course if you’re too scared…”\n”Aaargh! Alright! I’ll play your little game you mangy Earth mammal! We’ll do battle when we arrive and I’ll take great pleasure in crushing your skull!”\n\nRo-man breaks communication, and Moreau is more than a little disturbed by your recent conversation.\n\n“Wolf! You promised to help us! I knew you were a lot of things, but I thought you at least weren’t a liar!”\n“Calm the hell down Moreau! Despite what Ro-Man thinks, I have bough you guys some time. While me and Ro-Man are bashing each others heads in, the Martians will be gathered around watching and probably taking bets. Besides unsuccessful invasions and fucking human women, there’s nothing they like better than watching a fight.”\n“Okay, but what good does that do us? I mean even if you win, the Martians will still kill all of us.”\n“Ah that’s where you and the hippy freak coalition come in. I know you guys are fond of your drugs here, so when the Martians are watching I want you guys to act like hosts and serve drinks laced with LSD or whatever hallucinogenics you keep stashed here. By the time I finish kicking Ro-Man’s ass, the Martians will be tripping so hard you can make quick work of them.”\n“That’s not a bad plan, but I think we’ll dispense with killing them as you’re suggesting. We can just destroy their weapons.”\n“(Sigh) Alright suit yourselves. But unarmed Martians are still hostile, even if they aren’t typically threatening.”\n“If I can make my citizens civilized, I can do the same with Martians, now let’s get prepared. What do I serve them to drink though? Its not like we have whatever it is Martians like to drink here.”\n“Sure you do. You’ve got water. Mars isn’t known for having a lot of it, so they can’t get enough of the stuff. Its one of the reasons why they wanted Earth so damn bad.”\n\nA few days pass and Moreau prepares his citizens for the plan, while they build some risers and bleachers for the fight, meanwhile you get in some last minute training. Ro-Man might be an idiot, but you’ve got a pretty good idea that he’s very strong, you’ll have to be on the top of your game.\n\nYou watch the skies and finally the Martians arrive. They land and all come pouring out of their saucers firing their lasers in the air, and yelling about how they’re going to see a good fight. Ro-Man appears and looks as goofy as he always has. A large crowd gathers and soon it’s just you and Ro-Man in the center.\n\n“This is going to be your biggest mistake since your infamous Plan 9 invasion attempt.” You tell Ro-Man.\n",
  "page 50": "“Look I understand some of you freaks never had that predator instinct, but just because you’ve got herbivore blood doesn’t mean you can’t fight. Those antlers and horns are just for show, they’re for defense! And even if you’re a total sissy, you could at least act as scouts and shit. When the Martians approach you can neigh, whinny, baa, or uh…quack your heads off to warn the rest of us that will fight!”\n\nThey still don’t look convinced, now they’re starting to just leave. You begin to get angry.\n\n“Damn it, don’t you freaks want to live? They’re going to kill all of you stupid bastards when they get here! Grow a fuckin’ pair and stand up for your freak existence!\n\n“Stop calling us freaks, we are not animals!” one shouts.\n“Oh ho! Struck a nerve did I? Look at you fuckin’ freaks! You’re a goddamn embarrassment to mother nature! You know what I’ll be glad when the Martians waste your sorry asses. You don’t deserve to live.”\n“Fuck you! You’re no different than us you fucking hypocrite!”\n“The hell I ain’t! I am a creature of nature! My mother was a werewolf and my father was a werewolf, and guess what? THEIR parents were werewolves! You know who your parents were? The DNA of some dead animals and some stupid humans that Moreau captured! Then you disgustingly mate with each other and create more freaks. Bunch of fucking mongrels!”\n\nThe crowd is beginning to get angry with you now. Good. Your plan is working.\n\n“I can see that you’re all pissed off. You probably want to kick my ass; well that’s a bad idea, because I’m the only one who can properly train you in the short period of time, now save that anger for the Martians…”\n\nSuddenly someone throws a rock at your head, causing you to fall. Before you can get up, you feel a strong kick to the face (Literally a mule kick) this is then followed up by the entire town attacking you. You kill quite a few, but they’re very intent on killing you, and eventually they rip you apart and even devour parts of you to make sure you won’t be regenerating back from the dead. Some of the older freaks kill Dr. Moreau as they remember the cruelty he inflicted in the past.\n\nTheir new found animal side is short lived since when the Martians arrive, they bombard the island with death beams killing most of the inhabitants before invading. The Martians then easily mop up the few survivors.\n",
  "page 53": "You didn’t come here to do the job half assed, so you’re going to give it your all. The only real advantage Ro-Man has is his strength, other than that you’re a better fighter in every way. You start off with a foot smash to his shin, then following it up with a claw to the crotch. Ro-Man attempts to grab you, but you roll out of the way.\n\nYou run around behind him and strike a vicious blow to his kidneys (Or at least where you think they’re located, he isn’t human after all) he swings his big gorilla like arms and back hands you in the face, knocking you a couple of feet to the ground. The Martians are cheering loudly at this point. You see Moreau’s freaks serving the drinks in the stands. You have to at least keep this up until the drugs kick in, and even then you’re not sure what will happen. For all you know it won’t even effect the Martians.\n\nYou dodge another clumsy attack by Ro-Man and bite the fuck out of his leg ripping a good chunk off. Ugh! It tastes terrible! You’ll taste that for days assuming you live through this, which Ro-Man is attempting to make sure doesn’t happen, as he finally gets a good grip on you. He grabs you from the back and places you in a crushing bear hug. You can’t get free, the thing you can do is either use the back of your head and smash his face with it in a reverse head butt, or stretch your neck a bit and attempt to bite one of his massive arms.\n",
  "page 192": "You order everyone to surround Frankie to try to keep him off guard. Frankie watches as the wolfling encircle him, but he’s still slowly moving towards you.\n\nHe charges! A couple of the wolfling dive for his legs in an effort to stop him, but he’s like a juggernaut and keeps charging. Fortunately you’re still nimble and get out of his way as he smashes through the wall. The wolflings that dived for his legs, follow up and begin attack him with tooth and claw. It’s not having that great of an effect though, he’s got metal plating on that dead flesh now. Frankie kills the pair of them by smashing their heads together until there is nothing left except mush.\n\n“Everyone grab a weapon! Don’t fight him head on!” you bark at the survivors while attempting to find something. You find a large metal pole, though you’re reluctant to take it, with all the electricity in the damn room.\n\n“It’s useless! You’ll never defeat my boy Frankie!” Victor says.\n\nFrankie begins to approach you again.\n",
  "page 193": "Um…no.\n\nEven in your prime you would’ve had problems taking on Frankie in his current updated state. At your age it’s just unthinkable.\n\nYou attempt to bite his neck in an effort to tear his head off, but he crushes his strong metallic arms around you squeezing with all his might. Your pack attempts to help, but Frankie is too focused on his revenge. Even when you tear out his eyes, he continues to squash your internal organs until he finally breaks your back and throws you blindly into one of those electric generators.\n\nYour limp corpse fries for a little while, but unlike Frankie, it doesn’t bring you back to life.\n",
  "page 196": "You hold the pole like a medieval pike waiting to skewer Frankie when he comes charging at you. It’s like throwing rocks at a tank.\n\nThe pole certainly impales Frankie, but it barely slows him down, he continues his rush even as the pole breaks off into him and he slams his heavy body into you hard. You go flying into the wall and collapse on to the floor. Frankie follows up with stomping your head into mush. Werewolves do have regenerative powers, but you won’t be regenerating this severe damage since your brains have leaked out of your head.\n",
  "page 195": "Just as Frankie charges you again, you throw the pole as hard as you can at him like a spear. Bullseye! Literally. The pole slams into his left eye and straight through his head. It still doesn’t slow him down though and you just barely get out his way.\n\nFrankie stops his attack for a moment and attempts to remove the pole, but you and another wolfling don’t miss the opportunity. The pole is quite long and you grab it from the front, while the other grabs it from the back and you both run clockwise around Frankie. All the titanium plating in the world isn’t going to protect him from massive head trauma.\n\n“RARRRRGH! BRAIN!” Frankie yells as half of his head comes apart. As he attempts to keep his brains from falling out, and that’s when the rest of the pack begins to beat his head in even more with various blunt objects. He’s still putting up a fight though.\n\n“NO! STOP! FRANKIE! MY SON!” you hear Victor scream over the loudspeaker.\n\nVictor’s voice sounds like its very close. You see another door in the lab, and you’ve got a really good feeling that he’s behind it.\n\nYou leave the wolflings to finish off Frankie, and run to open the door.\n\nAnd there he is, Victor Frankenstein…\n\nOr what’s left of him at least, he’s just a brain in a jar, hooked up to various machines now.\n\n“Wow, Vic. I always knew you were a terrible mad scientist, but I would’ve thought you’d be able to at least create a robot body for yourself, or a youth elixir or something!”\n“Shut up Wolf! You haven’t won! I’ve still got…”\n“What? What’ve you got? Nothing! Unless you’re a giant space brain from Venus or some shit, you can’t do anything to me. And you ain’t, so…”\n”Wait! Wolf! Can’t we talk about this?”\n“Oh like you wanted to talk to me, when you fed me drugged meat?”\n“Oh yeah…you’re not still mad about that are you? I mean you did kill me for it…”\n”Yeah, and I should’ve stuck around to make sure you stayed dead. Well no mistakes this time.”\n\nYou take Victor’s brain out of the jar.\n\n“NOOOOOOOO……” are the last words to come out of the loud speakers before you step back into the lab where Frankie is flailing wildly at the wolflings who are carefully standing out of harms way as they continue to make quick strikes as him. He’s badly damaged and blind. Not deaf though. You call over to Frankie who turns around when he recognizes your voice.\n\n“Hey Frankie, your Dad wants to talk to you, he’s got a lot on his mind.” You say and then throw Victor’s brain into what remains of Frankie’s face. The brain splatters into bloody pieces, while you follow up with a quick and vicious attack.\n\nYou sink your fangs deep into Frankie’s shoulder until it hits the bone, where upon you rip off the arm at the socket. The rest of the pack follows your lead and help you rip Frankie apart, until he’s reduced to the pieces that made him up in the first place.\n\n“Damn, I think I broke a tooth on that fucking metal plating.” You say breathing heavily.\n“We won Wolf! You were right! This was fun! I felt the primal instinct and everything!” one of the wolflings exclaims.\n“Yeah and right now all of you are going to be feeling silver burning through your bodies.” Igor says standing in the lab door exit, pointing that infernal arm weapon at you all.\n",

You eviscerate Igor as the silver begins to take its toll on your system. He dies coughing up blood, apologizing for not being able to defend Victor in his death throws.\n\n“I’m sorry Victor…I’m sorry my brother…gurgle…”\n\nThe rest of the pack attempts to carry you out, but you refuse their help and stagger to the outside of the castle where you finally collapse on the ground. It seems so comfortable you figure you’ll just rest for awhile. You’re not surprised to see Mary standing over you.\n\n“I take it you killed my whole family.” She says unemotionally.\n“Yeah, even Igor. Never knew he was Vic’s brother. That explains a lot.”\n“Why? Why’d you do it? What was the point?! You could’ve just done my movie and still been alive! Or even if you didn’t want anything to do with me, you could’ve just went back to your cabin instead! You could’ve been alive!”\n“You’ll never understand Mary. You don’t get old. I did and I wasn’t meant to. I outlived my place in this world. No point in going on. Just had to get in one last monster fight and damn it felt good.”\nMary shakes her head, you think she might even shed a tear if she was capable.\n“Go on now Mary, there’s nothing for you here. Don’t morn your family. You were always better than the rest of them anyway. Don’t morn me either, I don’t want it. Go. The pack is coming.”\n\nMary gives you one last look and runs off before the rest of the pack arrives. When they do they begin howling loudly.\n\n“Goddammit shut the fuck up! I’m trying to die with a little peace and quiet here!” you snarl.\n“You have to lead us! You can’t die!” one wolfling says\n“The hell I can’t! Look I showed you what it means to truly be a Wolf tonight. It’s up to you to do something with it.”\n\nGinger kneels down and tries to sit you up hoping that you’re not really dying. She’s very upset.\n\n“You can’t die! I want you with me…I…”\n“Stop Ginger. Don’t say it. Don’t give yourself anymore unnecessary pain, especially when I don’t deserve it. It’s just as well as I die now, I probably would’ve only broken your heart later. Just remember me how I was in the short time you knew me and every time you look at your litter.”\n\nYou touch her stomach.\n\n“How do you know? I mean it’s too early, we can’t be sure if…” Ginger exclaims.\n“Please. I’m the Alpha Wolf. I never fucking miss. I got kids everywhere. None of them ever listened to me or talk to me, but I got ‘em.”\n“What do you want me to tell our litter about you?”\n“Whatever you want, you’ll be the one raising them and I’ll be too dead to do anything about it… just teach them what I taught all of you here tonight…hopefully they’ll listen. Damn willful pups…mmm…getting sleepy…one more thing…”\n“What’s that Wolf?”\n“Burn my damn body, I don’t want some fucker trying to bring me back to life! I hate the Undead!”\n\nYou close your eyes and feel the darkness envelop you.\n\nAfter a brief period of howling, the remaining pack members take your body and burn it just like you asked, then they all part ways, each to pursue their own destinies in their own way just like you did. A few months later, Ginger does indeed give birth to a new litter and teaches them about you and how you lived. (This is tempered by some common sense on her part though).\n\nAt last, a legacy worthy of an Alpha Wolf.\n",
  "page 230": "You push your way through the crowd and head towards where Renfield was lurking about. He isn’t far, you can smell him. You follow a long corridor and then turn the corner to see Renfield hobbling down another passage, you quickly knock him to the floor, turn him over and kneel on his chest. He attempts to struggle, but you’re still too strong for him.\n\n“Well, well, well, I’m surprised your faggot master still keeps you around. Shit, you smell terrible, I suppose along with your flesh rotting, and lousy hygiene in general, all those ass rammings have taken a toll on you eh? Where the hell is he?”\n”You! You’ve always been jealous of the master! Jealous of his wealth, his style and his beauty! You’re nothing, but a lowly animal!”\n“For someone who gets abused in every possible way, has no self respect, and is a filthy Ghoul, I wouldn’t be calling anyone a lowly animal. And you’re not really in the position to be pissing me off anyway. Now where the fuck is Fagula?”\n“The master is going enjoy killing you, especially tonight! Now he’ll be able to claim victory over TWO of his greatest enemies!”\n“What the hell are you blathering about?”\n“Oh you’ll find out…” Renfield smiles with a set of blacken teeth.\n“Yeah whatever, look last chance to…”\n\nSuddenly you feel a powerful crushing blow to the back of your head. It isn’t enough to knock you out, but you fall off of Renfield and roll over feeling very woozy. In your bleary vision you can make out the form of that cocksucker Dracula standing over you. Another figure stands there as well, you don’t know who they are, but they look somewhat familiar.\n\n“Wolf, I don’t believe I invited you to this party, but it was good of you to come anyway. It only makes festivities more enjoyable! I think you’ll give Jacob a good chance of testing himself. I was going to have him fight Renfield, but I’m sure you’ll provide much more of a challenge. You think you’re up for the challenge Jacob?”\n“Sounds perfect to me.” The other figure says and steps closer, and just before he kicks you in the head, you could swear it looks like Van Helsing, but much younger.\n\n“Sonofa…” you begin to say and then get your face kicked in, knocking you unconscious.\n\nTime passes and you wake up in a cage with silver bars. You see the figure that kicked you in the face on the other side, it is Van Helsing…or someone that looks like him since his name was Abraham, not Jacob. You find out soon enough, when he begins to speak.\n\n“Wolf, you’re up. Good. I’m anxious to test my new skills on you. Renfield certainly wouldn’t have been much of a challenge, but you should prove to be. Even my foolish grandfather couldn’t kill you. He couldn’t kill Dracula either, but then Dracula was always superior in everyway. I have no idea why he pursued such an idiotic quest of trying to kill Vampires, they really are the supreme life form on this planet and certainly the most lovely and sensual. Vladimir has shown me such pleasures since our time together.”\nYou shake your head and snicker. This must’ve been the “other” defeated enemy that Renfield was on about.\n“So, that’s how it is now? The Van Helsing bloodline finally defeated not through violence, but through seduction? Never thought I’d see the day come. I had my problems with your family and especially your father, but I could at least respect their dedication. You’re a fucking disgrace kid.”\n“On the contrary, I’m merely ensuring the survival of my family name. What was I supposed to do, carrying on some pointless family tradition of monster hunting, and get myself killed? Fuck that. I want to live forever.”\n“Yeah? Well you can scratch that plan, because when I get a hold of you, you’re going to be wishing you hadn’t turned into a fucking bloodsucker.”\n“(Sigh) Yes, Vladimir told me you were always one to make unimaginative threats, I’ll be more interested in hearing your howls of pain though, see you soon.”\n\nAs Jacob leaves you to your cage. You hear another voice in the room.\n\n“So…Vlad has now eliminated all his enemies, I guess I always knew he’d succeed.”\n\nYou see another holding cell, but one made of some kind of heavy duty unbreakable see-through plastic. The top of it has a ton of garlic hanging from it. Sitting and looking utterly defeated is an ugly distorted looking humanoid, who is yet another face you’re amazed to see. This revenge trip has just been one surprise after another.\n\n“Orlock? Heard you were dead.” you say.\n“I wish I was, unfortunately Dracula insists on keeping me alive…feeding me rats…tormenting me…reminding me of my shameful defeat by his hands…I’m proud of him.”\n“You’re happy that he’s torturing you? Sheesh, all you Undead are fucking masochists.”\n“I’m not happy that he’s torturing me you ignorant dog, I’m happy that he’s proven to be so ruthless, despite his foppish ways. I must admit I had my doubts about him when I first created him.”\n“Yeah, I see that really worked out well for you.”\n“(Sigh) True. But it’s my own fault for having a soft spot for him I suppose. I should’ve been more watchful of him. You’ll be lucky, he’ll just kill you, or rather have his new conquest Jacob do it.”\n“Nobody’s killing me, I’m getting the fuck outta here right now. These bars aren’t going to hold me.”\n“Won’t that be difficult Wolf? Seeing that the bars are made of silver?”\n“So fucking what? Doesn’t mean I can’t touch them! As long as the things aren’t going into my body they don’t mean shit! Thought you bloodsuckers knew that. See that’s the problem with you Vampires, always underestimating your enemies and being melodramatic. If Fagula and his bitch boys were smart they would’ve killed me when they had the chance. That’s what I would’ve done.”\n“You and I actually have more in common than you think. We both are the last of the old ways. I must admit that I too would’ve killed you immediately, rather than toy with such a dangerous enemy.”\n\nYou ignore Orlock and concentrate on the bars. You easily pry the silver bars open and step out of the cage; you then rip one of the bars out to take with you. Orlock looks at you with interest.\n\n“Why are you taking that?”\n“Because unlike you Vampires, we Werewolves try to learn everything we can about our enemies. I know for a fact that silver hurts you fuckers too, though you guys like to try to keep that shit quiet.”\n“Ah. Tis a shame we never clashed Wolf, you would’ve been a worthy opponent.”\n“Yeah? Well when I kill Drac, I can come back to finish you off too.”\n“Ha ha! Glad to see you have such confidence. However, if in the unlikely event that you do defeat Vlad, by all means come back and finish me off to put me out my misery. I would gladly welcome everlasting death at this point.”\n\nYou leave the room and find yourself in a corridor made of dull stone; you’re guessing you’re probably underground. Nobody’s around, but you can still hear the noise of the party above. You’re about to head back up when you hear a voice close by.\n\n“Psst! Wolf! Over here! Quick!”\n\nYou turn around and at one end of the corridor you see Mary. Now what the fuck is SHE doing here?! You rush over to Mary.\n\n“What the fuck are you doing here?” you ask.\n“Trying to prevent you from getting yourself killed, you stubborn macho asshole! When the Wolflings returned to the studio, I asked them where you went, and they told me, so I went after you. What the hell did you think you were doing coming here to kill Dracula?”\n“Just that! Kill his bloodsucking ass! How’d you sneak in here anyway?”\n”I didn’t, I got an invitation about a month ago to the party, so when I arrived I was expected. Then I heard you were taken down here by some of the guests.”\n“Oh I can see you and Drac are still chummy with each other, figures, all you Undead stick together. You’re probably here to help him not me!”\n”Goddammit Wolf, will you stop being so fucking paranoid! I wasn’t even going to this thing; the only reason why I’m here is because of you! Because maybe you don’t want to believe it, but I do love you, you’ve always only been the one to make me feel complete. After all the searching and traveling and trying to discover myself, it was our time together that I always held dear to me and stayed in my mind. Please, Wolf don’t go through with this, we lost a lot of years already; now that we’ve been reunited I don’t want to lose you permanently. This is isn’t worth it. You don’t have to prove anything. I’m familiar with the secret passages in this place, we could leave right now without any trouble.”\n\nMary’s face does show expression of concern, and her voice does display worry. She may or may not be telling the truth. If she isn’t then she’s done a good job of fooling you. However, even if she is telling you the truth, there’s something else at stake here, namely your principles and pride. You’d really hate to run from Dracula, especially at this point.\n",
  "page 178": "Even though you’re sure that the burning smell is probably where Vic is at, the sweet smell is so out of place here, you’re compelled to follow it. You tell the wolflings to follow the burning smell while you investigate the other one. They look a little unsure of being without you leading them, but they follow your instructions. Carefully avoiding traps, you travel further to different parts of the castle where the sweet smell starts getting so strong it’s almost sickening, until you finally get to a closed door.\n\nYou open the door to an elegant bedroom. The smell pervades the entire area. Someone soaked this place in perfume and there you see Mary standing there in a see-through nightgown. You’re genuinely surprised to see her here.\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist. I knew you’d follow this scent. it’s the very perfume I used to wear when we had our affair.”\n“Mary? What the hell are you doing here and why the hell did you douse the room in the shit?”\n“I know you don’t like the dead smell, I don’t like it either. I makes me remember that I’m not alive…I never was.”\n“Yeah, well this smell isn’t too pleasant either. Whew!”\n“You know out the many, many…many lovers I had, you know you’re the only one that made me feel alive? Like a real woman, instead of collection of parts as you’ve pointed out so accurately so many times.”\n\nMary begins to get closer to you.\n\n“Look Mary I ain’t got time for this reminiscing bullshit, I’m on a mission of kicking ass right now and you’d do well to stay out of my way. Why are you here anyway?” you ask again.\n“I figured after you left the studio, you’d be in a wicked mood. I thought you’d probably just take your pack and smash up a bar or something. I followed you for a bit and found out you were planning on coming here. Look. I understand that my family has wronged you in many ways. My dad has, Frankie has, and I know I have, but I can’t let you kill them. I know they’re all fucked up and even I don’t like them, but they’re still my family such as they are. Wolf you already got your revenge a long time ago. I mean you beat the hell out of Frankie and ended his career and I heard tales about how you even killed my Dad once before he created either of us. What’s this all going to prove? My dad isn’t any match for you now. He’s barely alive. Frankie has been just lying on a slab for years. Dad took him apart in an effort to fix him. That’s the only experiment he’s talking about and he’s nowhere completed. Dad spends all his time with the insane idea of revitalizing Frankie for a come back. I tell him that it isn’t going to happen, but he continues anyway. There’s no battle here Wolf. Just a lot of empty dreams and delusions.”\n\nAt this point she takes your paw and brushes her other hand against your fur.\n\n“Please Wolf, just let my family live. If you have any lingering feelings for me that I know you once did, just call off your attack.”\n",
  "page 177": "Knowing that Vic works with electricity a lot, you figure he’s in that direction. You and the wolflings that are still with you follow, carefully avoiding traps. You travel further to higher levels of the castle where the burning smell is getting stronger. You KNOW you’re getting closer to him. You can feel it. You just hope his “experiment” is as great as he claims. It would suck if there wasn’t a real battle to fight after all this.\n\nYou burst into the room with strong burning smell and see big globes of energy, conduits, generators and a big ass corpse with cybernetic implants lying on the table. It’s Frankie with some modifications and absorbing more electricity than lightning rod.\n\nYou half expect to see Victor somewhere, but all you hear is the loudspeaker disturbing your ears again.\n\n“You see Wolf! You see! While you’ve been wasting away in that shitty cabin, I’ve been preparing for my son’s come back! You stole his woman! You ended his career! You didn’t just damage him physically, you damaged his mind! Scarred him emotionally! It’s taken me YEARS to undo the damage!”\n“Damaged his mind? He was a psychopathic serial pedophile made of corpses! What the fuck kind of damage could I have done? And Mary never liked him anyway!”\n“She could’ve learned! He could’ve too! They just needed more time! But YOU! You prevented all that! You and your dog dick!”\n“For fuck’s sake, I wasn’t the only one fucking her!”\n“Yes, but you’re the one who did it the longest and destroyed my poor boy’s career! You’re going to pay! Ha ha ha ha! He’s up! HE’S ALIVE! HE’S ALIVE! HE’S ALIVE! Frankie look who we have here! And old friend, why don’t you go and give him a big hug?”\n\nVictor goes into his mad scientist laugh yet again, as Frankie “2.0” gets up from the table. He opens his eyes and looks directly at you.\n\n“FRANKIE BEAT YOUR HEAD IN NOW.” He says with a booming voice.\n\nStill as verbal and articulate as ever.\n",
  "page 210": "Nosferatu: Count Orlock\n\nThe bloodsuckers are big on keeping secrets. Nowadays, all Vampires have a “cool” look about them which fits in with their youthful image. Even the ones that are “old” are still regal and respectable looking. Its part of the whole “Let’s get stupid humans to serve us and be like us” routine that they like to employ. You keep telling the masses something long enough and they believe it and the past becomes forgotten.\n\nHowever even a secret slips out every now and then in movies and the hideous Nosferatu appear, but this is usually quickly dismissed as “creative license” and not based on any kind of fact. Vampires deliberately attempt to destroy any evidence of their ugly pasts. One old movie was actually supposed to be based on Count Orlock, but this movie was quickly ordered to be destroyed through Vampire string pulling.\n\nThe truth is Vampires weren’t always the “cool” MTV movie bullshit propaganda that that’s churned out now. In the past there were the Elders or the first Vampires who looked as repugnant as any rotting corpse, they are also known as the Nosferatu. You rarely had any encounters with them as most of them were dead by then, but you heard many stories from your grandfather about them. They hid in the shadows, striking from the darkness, and returning to isolation, they used no servants. They did not mix and carry on a charade of “humanity”. They were true monsters.\n\nOver time however, things change and so did Vampires, there became an “evolution” of sorts (Though you’re loathed to use a word for such unnatural creatures). In time it became necessary for trickery, to fit in, to blend with humans to prevent mass extinction from vampire hunters. Later generations started to retain their human looks, and the Nosferatu began to die off through various means. Most of them by the hands of their own younger kind. The younger generation saw the Nosferatu as a threat to their own survival, not to mention cramping their style. How were they supposed to get humans to willingly serve them, if these ugly Nosferatu were going around snatching children in the night? No, their time had come and gone, a new era must be ushered in. Eventually the Nostferatu were all hunted down and killed save one.\n\nCount Orlock was the last of the Nosferatu, he was by no means an Elder, but he was still old enough to not retain his humanity. Sensing his time was coming to a close, decided to create a servant to protect him. He sensed Vlad would be able to do this. The instant he made him into a Vampire, he attempted to instill loyalty into him and it worked…for awhile at least. Eventually Dracula realized that Orlock was more of a burden than a teacher, and he turned on him. Defeating him utterly, but contrary to what most know (For those that even know about the Nosferatu in the first place) he didn’t kill him.\n\nOrlock’s implanted loyalty did still exist, but it was to Orlock’s detriment. Dracula could not bring himself to kill his creator, but he could make his unlife a living hell. Keeping him a weaken captive and tormenting him for all time.\n\nHe’s been forgotten and held prisoner ever since.\n",
  "page 213": "Normally you aren’t one to fight defensively, however in this case it’s to your advantage. Jacob is eager to prove himself to Dracula and overconfident in his abilities.\n\nJacob rushes at you and you trip him to the floor. As he attempts get up you impale him through the back with the silver bar. He screams in pain, but it looks like you missed his heart, he back kicks you in the nuts before scrambling to get up.\n\nWhile you recover, Jacob pulls the bar out of his back and throws it at your head which you dodge. With a burst of speed, he leaps next to you and punches you three times in the face, the fourth time however his hand goes into your open mouth. You sink your fangs in, grab his arm and pull back with your head as hard as possible, biting it off at the forearm. Jacob reels back in shock as he stares in horror at his spurting bloody stump. You spit out the gory limb which flops on the floor. You quickly pick up your silver bar from the ground. The crowd looks on in captivated awe.\n\n“Well looks like I get to kill two Van Helsings, that’s already one more than Fagula over there. Though I have to say, your father put up a better fight and he was only human. You sure you weren’t adopted? You put up a poor showing boy, even for an overgrown leech.”\n“You dare call me a leech you fucking animal?! You haven’t won, look at what I found here!” Jacob reaches into vest pocket with his one good arm and pulls out a pistol. You already know what it’s loaded with.\n\nHe fires haphazardly at you, while you roll out of the way. Luckily he’s as bad of a shot as his father was. Guests start running out of the way after a few silver bullets start hitting them. He doesn’t care, who he hits, he’s too busy trying to make sure one of the bullets hits you.\n\n“I won’t fail where my father did, I will kill you! I WILL KILL HIM!” he screams. Of course in the chaos of everyone running around he doesn’t seem to realize you’ve appeared behind him.\n\n“Wrong again junior.” You say, turning him around and shoving the silver bar cruelly through his chest, hearing that satisfying crack of his upper ribs and the squishy sound of the bar hitting his heart.\n\nHe falls to the ground dropping his pistol and clutching the bar which you dig in deeper as he starts to melt.\n\n“When you get to hell, say hello to your dad for me…and I sincerely hope he and the rest of the dead Van Helsing clan kicks your pansy ass for all eternity you fucking traitor.”\n\nAs he releases one last death screech, you rip his head off and throw it at Dracula who hasn’t left his couch. He just looks at the melted skull and shrugs while you take your silver bar and prepare for the final battle.\n\n“Well I see your skills haven’t deteriorated, but there has been a great deal of luck involved here tonight as well. Unfortunately, you’ll find that your luck has run out. Do you actually think I’m going to dirty my hands on an animal such as you? Please. It wouldn’t be a contest anyway. My guests, I now give you the honor of fighting for me! That fool Van Helsing obviously wasn’t worthy of my love, but for any of you that lands the killing blow on this mangy dog, you shall know the pleasures that only I can show you.”\n“You gotta be fuckin’ kidding me Vlad! That’s supposed to be an honor? You’re just trying to get out of this shit because you’re fucking scared.” Im-Ho-Tep pipes up from the back ground.\n“Stay outta this Tep!” Dracula exclaims.\n“Hey, I’m not in this little feud, but I’m calling it like I see it. You’re not willing to fight an old and tired Werewolf who’s supposed to be inferior to you anyway? Now you do whatever, but if you’re seriously going to let your followers do your dirty work, then you really are a big pussy.”\n\nThere’s a moment of silence as Dracula looks at Tep and then back over at you. He stares at you and then…\n\n“KILL HIM MY CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT!” Dracula commands\n“Goddammit I knew it!” you say to yourself.\n\nYou hear Tep shout over the crowd.\n\n“Sorry Wolf I thought he’d go for it!”\n\nAs the crowd of vampires, ghouls and human servants advance on you, you think about how many you can take out before they finally get you. Just then it looks like Drac was wrong, your luck hasn’t run out yet. Werewolves crash through the windows, and attack! They look like the ones from the studio! Then Mary comes rushing into the room smashing a Ghoul in the head, and stands fighting by your side while you fight off an attacking vampire.\n\n“Mary! What’re you still doing here?! And how’d you get them to help?” you shout, twisting the vampire’s head completely around.\n“You didn’t think I came here by myself did you? I figured you’d insist on killing Drac. So I had the Wolflings come with me and told them to stay back until the appointed time.”\n“But how?! I tried to get them to come and they didn’t listen to me! And I’m a fucking Werewolf!”\n“Well, I’m a people person, while you’re mean old bastard, so of course they’d be more willing to listen to me. Plus I told them about how you paved the way for all of them and how they should be grateful.”\n“You told them you were going to replace them with human actors in furry suits didn’t you?”\n“Well…yeah, but that doesn’t mean the other stuff didn’t work either! Ugh! These ghouls aren’t very study are they?” Mary says putting her fist right through the face of one of them.\n\n“Hey Wolf, I hate to interrupt, but Vlad just went running down that corridor when your wolf pack arrived. I think you better go catch him. Oh hey Mary, I haven’t seen you for awhile, how have you been?” Tep says shuffling up to the both of you.\n“Tep! I was just thinking about you the other day! I’ve been alright, how about you?”\n\nWhile Mary and Tep bizarrely exchange pleasantries in the chaos of battle you head down the corridor that Tep pointed out with your silver bar. Eventually it leads into a study of some sort. You cautiously enter, but you’re immediately ambushed and thrown into a bookcase hard which then falls on you.\n\n“It ends here Wolf.” You hear Drac say as you crawl from underneath the bookcase.\n",
  "page 179": "Mary’s plea for you to spare her family has gotten to you. Maybe she’s right. Maybe you did do a lot of damage to them already. Maybe you were just trying to relive your own youth.\n\nMaybe you’re a complete fucking idiot.\n\nAs soon as you embrace Mary, you feel multiple shots to the back and extreme pain. You collapse to the floor, as Mary stands back from you angrily shouting.\n\n“Igor, you humped backed fucker! Those bullets went through him and hit me! Asshole!”\n“Hey, I can’t control the damn power of this thing. So is he dead?”\n“Not quite.”\n\nMary heftily kicks you over as you struggle to breathe.\n\n“Poor Wolf. You of all people forgot the cardinal rule. Blood is always thicker and you abandoned your own kind over silly nostalgic feelings for me. I am touched though. I shall always remember you as your pelt covers my body as a new coat. Time to put this doggie down Igor.”\n“I’m on it.”\n\nIgor raises his weapon once more and blasts your head off in a hail of silver.\n",
  "page 212": "You charge at Jacob with your silver bar, but you miss and he swiftly grabs it from you. You turn around and he smashes you in the face with it, knocking you to the ground. You attempt to get back up, but shoves the bar into your stomach with a great force, knocking the wind and fight completely out of you. You cough up blood as Jacob stands over you.\n\n“Maybe my father failed to kill you, but I won’t. Time to put you to sleep little doggy.” Jacob says and then pulls out a pistol and shoots you in the head with silver bullets.\n",
  "page 215": "You scramble for the silver bar and try to back away, but Dracula won’t allow you the chance to regain your strength. He rips the bar from your hands and hits you with it. You claw him across the face and get him in bear like hug so he can’t get enough momentum to shove the bar into you, but he’s got something different in mind.\n\n“Fucking animals like you need collars!” he says and wraps the bar around your neck! As your airway becomes constricted, you release Drac who then takes complete advantage and gets behind you and tightens the twisted silver even more eventually choking you out.\n\nA few minutes later you wake up before Tep and Mary who’s taken the silver bar from around your neck.\n\n“Wolf?! Are you alive? Speak to me!” Mary says.\n“(Cough! Cough!) Yeah…shit…(Cough!) What the fuck happened?”\n“Well looks like old Drac got the drop on you and tried to strangle you. Guess he didn’t do a very good job though since you’re still alive. He ran off though; don’t know where he went, probably to one of his other homes. Well, I guess this makes it a bit of a tie. I guess nobody collects the bet. Though I still think you would’ve won in a fair fight.” Tep says.\n\n“Ah shit, I gotta (Cough!) track his ass down, gather up the Wolflings…and…”\n”NO! You’ll do no such thing! Most of the Wolflings are dead, and YOU almost died tonight too! I’m not having you risk that again over this foolishness! You’re coming home with me right now!”\n\nMary takes you back to her place where you rest up. You still want to go after Dracula, but Mary is very convincing and eventually you give up on it and work on her movie (Which was rewritten) instead.\n\nAs for Dracula you don’t hear from him ever again, obviously he knows it was a close call and doesn’t want to risk another battle with you.\n\nStill it always pisses you off that it was a “tie”.\n",
  "page 216": "You stagger over to attack Drac, but he dodges and throws you into another wall. You slam to the floor landing behind a desk.\n\n“You think you could come here to defeat me? You’re a fucking loser Wolf! You always will be! You know why? Because you don’t have any style or class! You should be thanking me for putting an end to your miserable existence! I think I’ll take some revenge on Mary too, since she felt the need to help you…”\n\nWhile he’s making dramatic villainous speeches you were searching the drawers in the desk and found a very sharp letter opener. You pop up from behind the desk and throw it at Drac, hitting him directly in the eye!\n\n“ARRRGH! MY EYE!” he bellows while pulling the opener out taking the bloody orb with it. You then lift up the entire desk and throw it at him! It crashes into his body, knocking him onto the floor. You grab your silver bar from the floor and prepare to do some more permanent harm to Drac, but he lifts the desk off of himself, before you can take advantage.\n\n“You’re going to pay for this you lowly dog!” he shouts and kicks the bar from your hand. He then kicks you in the stomach and brings both of his fists down on your head when you hunch over from the stomach kick. You take the opportunity to grab him by the legs and in a fireman carry, you run straight forward with him over your back, out the window!\n\nBoth of your bodies crash and fall to the outside courtyard ground, broken glass embeds itself in both of your bodies, but mostly Drac’s. He pushes you off of him and retreats. You don’t give up your attack and tackle him, and bite deep into his leg. He kicks you with the other foot, but not before you tear off his leg from the bottom of the shin. Blood splatters all over the place.\n\nAt this point Drac is too enraged to run and grabs hold of you and bites you deep in the neck! You feel the energy rapidly leaving you.\n",
  "page 219": "You have to get him off of you NOW! You immediately smash him in the face as hard as you can, and then again, and then again, and then again; finally he releases his grip and falls to the ground while you retreat a bit trying to shake the dizziness from the loss of blood.\n\nDrac having gained a little more strength from his quick meal makes an escape attempt by transforming into a bat.\n\n“Oh fuck no, you’re not getting away that easy!” you grab a nearby stone and throw it, smacking him out of the air. He falls to the ground in a bloody heap and transforms back into humanoid form. You run over and kick him repeatedly in the head and then starts smashing the back of his skull into the pavement until blood and brains come leaking out. Drac begins to beg for mercy.\n\n“Wolf! Stop! I give up! Please! Surely you as a man of honor can see that you’ve defeated me and will show mercy!”\n\nYou nearly shit yourself laughing.\n\n“I’m afraid I can’t do that since as you were so fondly reminding me…I’m a fucking dog and like any good dog when we smell fear, we go in for the kill!” you say amused.\n\nDracula, sensing this truly is the end for him attempts a different approach.\n\n“Very well you fucking animal! Kill me! But know this! You’ll never be as famous as me! People shall always remember me even after my death! My fame and name will still live on long after you’re rotting in a pet cemetery!”\n“…maybe…maybe you’re right…but you won’t be around to enjoy it!” you say and break his back over your knee and clamp your jaws around Drac’s throat ripping it out. He clutches at his new gruesome tracheotomy and then begins to smoke suddenly. The Sun! Its morning! You’ve been here so long you completely forgot about the passage of time.\n\nYou finish ripping off Drac’s head and then hold it up high to the sunlight and howl in victory. Then it burns up and explodes, (Along with the body) injuring you and knocking you to the ground.\n\nYou brush yourself off and remind yourself never to do that again! Meanwhile Mary, Tep and a few of the surviving Wolflings come outside to see what’s going on.\n\n“Wolf are you alright?!” Mary asks.\n“Yeah I’m fine, told you we’d see each other again.” You say and kiss her.\n“Well Wolf, I guess this makes you the winner, looks like Erik owes me a thousand dollars.” Tep replies looking at the ashes blowing all over the courtyard.\n“Yeah and I owe Erik an ass whipping for betting against me in the first place!”\n“Well I’m just glad you’re alive and it’s over.” Mary says.\n“Not quite, there’s still one more loose end I need to take care of, but it shouldn’t take long…”\n\nYou head back down to the basement; Count Orlock is still lying slumped in the corner of his cell. He looks up when he sees you come in with your silver bar.\n\n“You’re back…so I guess this means Vlad is dead?”\n“Got it in one bloodsucker.”\n“(Sigh) Such a shameful defeat. He deserved much better…but then so did I…let’s get this over with. The lever to open this cell is over there.”\n\nYou pull the lever and the cell opens. Count Orlock stand before you completely still as you approach. You expect him to put up some kind of resistance, but he doesn’t. He looks resigned and actually relieved to accept his fate. You plunge the bar into his chest.\n\n“At last my torment is at an end.” He says before you take his head.\n\nIt is done. All loose ends have been taken care of. You go back outside and meet back up with Mary.\n\nAfter resting up (And participating in some less restful “activity” with Mary) you agree to work on the new movie that Mary has decided to do instead. Namely a movie based on your battle with Dracula. Of course most of the true story is changed around and a bunch of young monsters are all cast in the roles. (Mary even got an Aztec mummy to portray Tep) you don’t really mind not getting to play “yourself” though, you understand that youth sells better, besides it’s a lot easier sitting on your ass and just raking in the money from the movie since it turns out to be a big blockbuster hit. Perhaps Dracula’s name will always been more well known, but yours will always be known as the one who killed him and that’s certainly something you don’t mind being remembered best for.\n\nYou live out the rest of your life with Mary, your days of battle finally behind you, but confident in your knowledge that you have made a permanent impact on the world.\n\nYour legacy as the Alpha Wolf is secured in history.\n",
  "page 218": "Pulling someone’s heart out is never as easy as it appears in the movies, but you muster up all your strength and plunge your fist into Drac’s chest. He winces in pain, but continues to drain your blood. You break through the rib cage until you feel that squishy four chambered organ in your clutches.\n\nAs your energy and life begin to ebb you pull it out and crush it into a bloody mess right before his eyes. He then begins to smoke suddenly. The sun! Its morning! You’ve been here so long you completely forgot about the passage of time.\n\n“Looks like it’s the end for both of us bloodsucker, but I’m making sure I live an extra minute longer to see you die first.” You say and collapse.\n\nDrac falls into a weird death spasm, and crawls in a hopeless escape attempt, but there is no escape. If the destruction of his heart didn’t kill him the sun certainly does. He shrieks as his body becomes a flaming torch and spectacularly explodes. At this point Mary, Tep and some of the remaining Wolflings rush outside to see what’s going on. Mary immediately rushes to you.\n\n“Wolf! No!” Mary shouts holding you. She’d probably shed tears if she was capable.\n“Is he dead?” you ask.\n“Yeah, Wolf he’s dead. You killed him. I always knew you’d be able to do it.” Tep says.\n“Good, now I can die happy now.”\n“No! I don’t want you to die! Why couldn’t you have just come with me?!”\n“I’m sorry Mary, but this is the way it had to be. I wasn’t meant to live a regular life. I wasn’t supposed to get old. I was supposed to die in combat…and I have…there’s nothing else for me here now. Its time for me to leave this world that no longer wants me.”\n“I’m here! I want you with me!”\n\nYou smile weakly and grab her hand tightly.\n\n“I would if I could…just remember the good times Mary…and thank you for what you did tonight…I know that you did truly love me…just remember to burn my body, I don’t want to take the chance of coming back as one of these leeches.”\n\nYou feel darkness envelop as Mary holds you close.\n“Tep, one thing before I leave.”\n“What’s that Wolf?”\n“When you collect your money from Erik, kick his fucking ass for betting against me!”\n\nYou close your eyes and then nothing.\n\nAfter a brief period of mourning, Mary follows your last orders and burns your body. A few months later she writes a book about you and ultimately makes a movie about your final battle with Dracula, it’s a blockbuster hit. The movie is also dedicated in loving memory of you.\n\nMary makes sure the legacy of the Alpha Wolf lives on…\n",
  "page 68": "No way are you going to miss a front row seat to watch the master do his work! You just need a good place to be at that’s out of the way of the destruction.\n\n“Okay so now that that’s settled, is there any place on the island that’s relatively uninhabited?” you ask\n“As you can see the island is mostly still in its natural state, but I’m assuming you’re talking about areas that aren’t visited or traveled very often, well there’s a peninsula on the island that’s pretty much avoided since it just consists of a rocky plateau. Nothing grows there and it’s barren.”\n”Good that’s where I’ll be then.” You say.\nMoreau looks at you wondering why you’re acting strangely, then he wonders the same thing about Gil when he starts asking to leave.\n\n“Uh…Moreau can you take me back to the mainland? I don’t care; just drop me off at the nearest swamp.” Gil asks.\n“What?! I can’t leave right now, the Martians will be here soon and so will your cousin, I have to look out for my people! Why do you want to leave anyway? I thought you were going to live here.”\n“I changed my mind! Look it won’t take that long, I just need to leave!”\n“Well I’m not leaving now, you’ll have to wait until this blows over. Or if you really want to leave I’m sure you can swim.”\n”It’s the fucking ocean you dick! I can’t be swimming in saltwater for extended periods of time! I can’t wait either! My cousin still sounded like he was pissed at me! He’ll destroy this whole island and me with it!”\n“What?!” Moreau says startled.\n“Uh, Gil’s exaggerating! Nothing to worry about!” you say attempting to shut Gil up.\n“Wait a minute! What the hell have you two brought to my island!?”\n“Dammit Moreau, if you don’t know who the fuck Godzilla is it’s your own damn fault! Look just keep your freaks out of the way and everything will be fine.” You say.\n\nNow Moreau looks as green as Gil, who’s looking even greener if such a thing was possible. They’re looking very worried.\n",
  "page 67": "You respect and even admire Godzilla for his abilities, but you’re not a damn idiot! When Godzilla comes to kick ass, he goes into overkill. You don’t want to be anywhere on the island when he arrives. You ask Moreau for your money.\n\n“Alright Moreau, you said I could have my reward in cash, I’ll be taking it now seeing as my work here is done.”\n“What?! You haven’t done anything!” Moreau says.\n“The hell I didn’t, I got Godzilla to come here. He’ll solve your Martian problem.”\n“Okay there’s two things wrong with that statement. First of all YOU still aren’t personally doing anything. Second of all Godzilla is Gil’s cousin not yours, if anything he gets credit for this before you!”\n“Yeah!” Gil remarks.\n“That may be, but I’m the one who convinced Godzilla to come here! Gil was too busy stuttering and apologizing.”\n“Godzilla’s not even here yet! I’m not paying you anything; you can wait until after he gets rid of the Martians.”\n\nLooks like Moreau isn’t parting with anything until after the job is completed, but if you wait until after Godzilla does his thing there won’t be anything left on the island to part with and that’s assuming you can find some place to lay low to avoid the sheer destruction that’s sure to come. (Even though Moreau seems to be ignorant of what’s about to occur to his Utopia)\n",
  "page 69": "King of the Monsters: Godzilla\n\nNaturally you never got to hang out with him since he ran in his own circle and did most of his films in Japan, but you have nothing, but respect for Godzilla. He’s beaten the shit out of everything that’s been thrown at him. Humans, Aliens, Robots, other Giant Monsters, all of them decimated. If there was anyone else you had to be, you’d be Godzilla.\n\nThere are no words that you could say that would do him justice. He’s the pinnacle of badassitude.\n\nHe really is the King of the Monsters and will always be a legend.\n",
  "page 62": "“Well we have to work with what we got Gil, nothing else for it.”\n“(Sigh) I don’t know, I tried already, and none of them have any kind of fighter instinct.”\n“You probably were treating them like something you scraped off your scales.”\n“Oh and I suppose you’d treat them better?”\n“Not really, but they might respond better to me, I can be diplomatic.”\n“Ha ha ha ha! YOU!? Diplomatic?! Alright I’ll help because I gotta see this!”\n\nYou and Gil go to back to Moreau’s freak town, where the freaks stare at you again. You call everyone to gather around.\n\n“Alright you freaks come gather around! Now then, it has become quite apparent to me that all of you are a bunch of hippy weaklings who would’ve been killed a long time ago, if you actually lived in reality. Well soon the reality will come to rectify that mistake if you don’t stand up to the Martians that will be coming to annihilate this little so called paradise you all have.”\n“Oh maybe if we’re real nice to them, they’ll let us live!” one says.\n“Not familiar with Martians are you? They’re not the nicest beings in any sense of the word. They’ve attempted to conquer this planet several times and have killed millions of humans. What do you think they’ll do to you freaks?”\n“I’m sure they can be reasonable, if we just ask them nicely to live with us in peace.”\n“Argh! Didn’t you fucking freaks hear what I said?! I said they’ll fucking kill ALL of you! Now if you fight back you might have a chance! All you have to do is evacuate your town and whatever little settlements you have on this island and take to the wilderness. You could easily conduct a successful guerilla war on here. Martians aren’t very good tacticians and have bad immune systems. They’ll probably catch malaria and every other disease under the sun attempting to root you guys out and I of course will be the one leading you to victory!”\n\nYour speech is met with more silence and disapproval.\n\n“No! We shall not give in to hatred and violence! Those are the old ways!”\n“Yes and some of us never followed those ways in the first place!”\n\n“That went over real well, got any other ideas?” Gil asks you.\n",
  "page 61": "If you actually had any friends you’d ask them if they could help, but since you don’t, you ask Gil if he knows anyone.\n\n“Not really.” He says.\n“Come on Gil, I mean you must know someone! There were a ton of aquatic sea monsters!”\n“Oh yeah, we ALL know each other. Damn land dweller ignorance. I bet we all look alike to too you right?” Gil says annoyed.\n“And I suppose you don’t think we all look alike?” you retort.\n“Alright nevermind. I don’t know though, most of the beings I know, tolerate land dwellers even less than I do. And most of them can’t even leave the water to begin with.”\n“I guess giant crabs and squids are out of the question then huh?”\n“You guess right.”\n“Damn.”\n“Okay well, I DO have a cousin that might help, but we haven’t spoken in years.”\n“Would he be of much help?”\n“Oh he’d be more than enough help; he doesn’t much care for aliens in general. In fact he doesn’t like anyone and is very violent.”\n“Sounds like a great guy.” You say.\n“Hmm, yes I’m sure you and he have a few things in common. He’s another that pointless picks fights and believes in proving his dominance whenever possible.”\n“Well get his ass over here!”\n“I don’t know if he’ll come, we had a fight about something a long time ago hence the reason we haven’t spoken.”\n“Gil, I know Moreau has at least one phone on this island. USE IT. NOW!”\n“Alright, I’ll try, but like I said I don’t know if he’ll come to help.\n\nYou and Gil make your way back to Moreau’s freak town where the freaks still give you strange looks. You knock on Moreau’s door.\n\n“Hey Moreau! Open up, Gil’s gotta use the phone.”\n\nMoreau looks as haggard as ever when he opens his door.\n\n“Damn Moreau, you look like shit, you really need to take better care of yourself. Eat some fucking meat. Anyway, Gil has a bad ass cousin apparently that can help, he just needs to call him.”\n“Wolf, I don’t know if he’ll come, and now that I’m thinking about it, I don’t know if I WANT him to come. He might still be pissed at me.”\n”Have some faith Gil.”\n\nGil picks up the phone and starts pressing a million numbers.\n\n“Where the hell does your cousin live, Gil?”\n“Japan. Oh I got a tone…here he is. Hello Godzilla?”\n\n“Your cousin is FUCKING GODZILLA?!” you ask.\n“Oh even I’ve heard of him, heard he was giant lizard that routinely defeated other monsters and aliens. Surely he’ll be able to help.” Moreau says hopefully.\n\nYou look at Moreau in disbelief, he apparently has been such a recluse he hasn’t even kept up on who the fuck Godzilla really is and the extent of his power. You know damn well if Godzilla comes here, the Martians will be destroyed, but so will everything else on the island!\n\n“It’s me. No don’t hang up! Look I’m sorry about that! I didn’t mean for that to happen! Come on I really need your help. I’m in a predicament and…”\n\nYou snatch the phone from Gil\n\n“Dammit, no matter what shit happened between you two, you should at least know how your cousin’s mind operates by now, Gil!” you say to Gil.\n\n“Hello, Godzilla? Big fan. My name’s Wolf you might know me, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t. Look there’s a bunch of fucking Martians coming down to Earth thinking they’re tough shit and acting like they’re going to own the place. Yeah I know you’re King of the Monsters here on Earth, but you know how all aliens are, they’re arrogant bastards. Okay. Oh why thank you! That was my favorite role; I got to kill 17 humans in that one! Glad to see you have heard of me. Alright bye.”\n\nYou turn to Moreau and Gil.\n\n“He’s coming.” You say.\n",
  "page 64": "You’re determined to make these freaks fight, mainly because you’re too stubborn to give up. You start going on about natural law, survival of the fittest an all those other might makes right philosophies you subscribe to. After about a day of this, some of the carnivorous and omnivore freaks begin to find something that still dwells within them. Even the herbivores start tapping into their human side to get that aggressive streak within them.\n\nNow you’ve got something to work with! Unfortunately you don’t have much time. You and Gil only manage to give the bare minimum of training when the Martians arrive. You manage to get most of them to evacuate before they do their initial saucer bombardment. Dr. Moreau stays behind to die after seeing what you’re turning his “citizens” into; he doesn’t want to be any part of it. As far as he’s concerned his Utopia is over.\n\nBut your battle is just beginning! Just like you suggested you, Gil and the freaks take to the jungles which they all know like the back of their paws, hoofs, etc. You get some of the freaks that have burrowing skills to create a system of underground tunnels, where you do your training, planning and where you strike from.\n\nThe Martians meanwhile use their superior technology to combat you, but they aren’t very successful. They can’t just destroy the entire island since they’re attempting to hold it, this all results in a war of attrition that ultimately ends very badly for them as they die of diseases, ambushes and the like. It also doesn’t help when you get a hold of some of their weapons. Eventually they pull out. Gil parts ways with you at this point and goes back to live in his bit of swamp where he originally wanted to spend the remainder of his days. Nobody ever bothers him again. You however take control of the island. The freaks are a lot more to your liking now. No more of that pussy peace shit. No more “No spill blood law” either. The only law now is the law of the jungle. (Well since you’re in charge, you tend to make “rules” that benefit you though)\n\nYou live out the rest of your years in relative luxury mating with a Fox woman on a regular basis. Amazingly she gives birth to some weird crossbreed. You “imaginatively” call him Wox and teach him the same thing you taught everyone else. When Wox grows up he’s so grateful for your ruthless teachings that he decides that you’ve earned you rest and kills you for ruler ship of the island.\n\nYou don’t blame him though it’s the natural order of things.\n",
  "page 63": "This is too frustrating to you and once again you’re sickened with how nature has been perverted like this. You can’t take it any more. You start killing the nearest freaks to you. Naturally this all results in a lot of running and screaming on their part. The blood lust gets to you, so you don’t just stop there, you won’t be happy until you’ve killed them all.\n\nDr. Moreau comes out to see what’s going on, and immediately goes into shock at the sight of his citizens lying on the ground in bloody heaps. He then clutches his heart and falls over dead.\n\nGil sees that you’re busy, so he goes back to his swamp mumbling something about land dwellers.\n\nBy the time the Martians arrive you’ve pretty much done their job for them. They take this as a sign of genuine steps to improve Martian-Earthling relations. They thank you and allow you to live on the island for free. You accept since it beats going back to the run down cabin and having to pay rent.\n\nAs it turns out, Martians aren’t really such bad neighbors. A lot of them are pretty stupid, but then so are most humans. Life doesn’t change too much for you.\n\nJust goes to show wherever you go, there you are.\n",

For a moment she almost displayed real emotions and feelings.\n\nFor a moment you almost were a complete idiot, except you remember the old prejudice that you’ve never forgotten:\n\n“No matter how much the Undead try to mimic feelings, they have none.”\n\nYou hear a click of a wall opening up. You see a metal arm point out and run out of the room, pushing Mary in the way. Igor opens fire and Mary takes king’s ransom in silver to her body, toppling her over with a heavy thud. She’s not dead, but she’ll need some new parts and a major stitch job.\n\n“Igor, you fucking idiot!” she yells from the floor attempting to get up. “Go help Dad! Wolf’s probably on his way there!”\n\nIf Mary knew you were coming back, she probably wouldn’t have dismissed Igor so quickly. She manages to stand up just as you stand in the doorway…with a torch.\n\n“You know what I like about these old castles? They always have torches and candles lighting the corridors.” You say.\n“Even in my present condition, you won’t get close enough to use that thing!” Mary says with defiance.\n“Save your feeble threats, but I don’t need to get close, you doused your room with perfume in your overly elaborate and dramatic attempt to trick me. Bye bye baby.”\n\nMary’s eyes widen as you dump the torch on the floor which lights up the room spectacularly. Mary attempts to get out of flames, but all the silver in her body makes her too heavy and she falls over again.\n\n“Hmm, maybe the undead do have emotions. She certainly looked scared and sounds like she’s in pain.” You say as you leave to catch up with the rest of the pack.\n\nYou don’t get far when you see the wolflings running towards you. Many of them are wounded, some badly.\n\n“What’s going on?” you ask, stopping one of them.\n“It’s too damn big! It’s unstoppable! We really tried! Honest!”\n“What?!”\n“Frankie! He’s been heavily modified. He doesn’t look at all like he did the old pictures I’ve ever seen of him!”\n\nNo sooner have you been informed when you hear that damn loud speaker again, the remaining wolflings run past you.\n\n“You see Wolf! You see! While you’ve been wasting away in that shitty cabin, I’ve been preparing for my son’s come back! You stole his woman! You ended his career! You didn’t just damage him physically, you damaged his mind! Scarred him emotionally! It’s taken me YEARS to undo the damage!”\n“Damaged his mind? He was a psychopathic serial pedophile made of corpses! What the fuck kind of damage could I have done? And Mary never liked him anyway!” you retort.\n“She could’ve learned! He could’ve too! They just needed more time! But YOU! You prevented all that! You and your dog dick!”\n“For fuck’s sake I wasn’t the only one fucking her!”\n“Yes, but you’re the one who did it the longest and destroyed my poor boy’s career! You’re going to pay! Frankie look who we have here! And old friend, why don’t you go and give him a big hug?”\n\nVictor goes into his mad scientist laugh yet again, and Frankie “2.0” comes lumbering down the hallway, he’s definitely got that cybernetic look now.\n\n“FRANKIE BEAT YOUR HEAD IN.” He says with a booming voice.\n\nStill as verbal and articulate as ever.\n",
  "page 183": "You jump out of Frankie’s way as he smashes into the wall behind you. You make your way quickly down the stairs, where you here Frankie getting back up and following you down them like a freight train.\nYou’re still a good ways from the bottom, but you see Igor appear at the bottom. You can’t stop or Frankie will slam into you and probably kill you by breaking every bone in your body and tearing you apart. You can keep going and attempt to jump towards Igor hoping you’ll land on him before he can fire accurately or you could jump over the banister and get out of the way altogether. The only problem with this is you’re still pretty high up. You wouldn’t die from such a fall, but you could break something if you land wrong and you certainly don’t want that disadvantage.\n",
  "page 182": "The problem with this tactic, is you’ve neglected to remember that Frankie has been vastly updated whereas Mary wasn.’t. Titanium plating doesn’t burn very well, as you find this out the hard way when you grab a nearby torch and shove it into Frankie’s body. It doesn’t do any notable damage. Frankie does some notable damage to you though.\n\nHe grabs your arm, breaking it in several places, and then takes the torch and sets YOU on fire, by shoving the flaming torch right through your body.\n\nFur seems to burn very well.\n",
  "page 185": "You jump over the banister. Frankie goes flying past you unable to stop himself. You hear gunfire and some sounds of bullets plinking off of metal and burying themselves into flesh.\n\n“OH SHIT!” you hear Igor shout. This term is followed by your own, when you see that you were a lot higher than you thought. You go crashing through a solid wooden dining table. It hurts...A LOT.\n\nYou don’t get up right away and you half expect Frankie or Igor to come and finish you off, but fortunately that doesn’t happen. You painfully rise and prepare yourself for the final battle, which doesn’t occur.\n\nYou go over to the bottom of the stairs and see the wolflings taking advantage of Frankie’s weakened prone state and getting revenge for the beating he gave them all earlier. As for Igor he’s lying under Frankie crushed and dying. He’s bleeding from his ears, mouth, nose and eyes.\n\n“(Gurgle) (sputter) I’m sorry…Vic…Sorry brother…(Gurgle)” he says before dying.\n“Well I guess that explains his loyalty.” You say to yourself.\n\n“Hey Wolf you want to get in on this?” A wolfling says ripping a hand off of Frankie.\n“Nah, you’ve earned this. I’m just going to go back upstairs and finish off Victor.”\n“Need any of us to come up with you?”\n“No, you just make sure you do a good job of killing Frankie there.”\n\nYou head back up stairs and head to the lab that Frankie came bursting out of, it’s empty, but there’s another door in the room and you’ve got the impression that a certain doctor is behind it.\n\nYou open the door to a small room with a bunch of big computers hooked up to a brain in a jar…\n\n“Dr. Frankenstein I presume?” you say. “Wow Vic, I would’ve thought you would’ve at least made a clone body or something.”\n“Frankie! Igor! Get in here! NOW!”\n‘They’re dead just like you’ll be soon and should’ve been before.”\n“Erm…Wolf! Hold on! Come on, I can’t do anything to you! This isn’t fair! Hold on how about…”\n“How about you shut up and die?” you say and take Victor’s brain out of the jar.\n\n“NOOOOOO….” Is the last thing that comes out of the loud speakers as you crush the brain under your foot.\n\nIts over. You won, and you fucking hurt like hell. You stagger back downstairs where you find Frankie completely in pieces. The wolflings look at you expectantly.\n\n“Did you kill him?’\n“Yeah, and it was hardly worth the effort.” You reply.\n“What are we going to do now?” another asks.\n“Well I don’t know about you, but I’m going back home to rest.”\n“But aren’t you taking us to raise hell somewhere else?”\n“Maybe some other day. Look I’m not here to lead you around by the paw. If you want to raise hell you can certainly do it without me. I showed you the way of the wolf tonight, it’s up to you to do something with it. Just remember you’re fucking werewolves, live up to the name.”\n\nYou get back on your Harley and head home. Hopefully you taught the new generation something so tonight wasn’t a complete bust. You didn’t really get to have the epic battle you were looking for, but you survived and in the end that’s what it’s all about.\n",
  "page 186": "What happens next is so quick it’s amazing you survive it.\n\nYou leap up in the air in an effort to land on Igor before he fires. Frankie is still charging behind you, but that changes when you leap up into the air, because he ends up being underneath you when gains more momentum.\n\nMeanwhile Igor is attempting to lift that heavy arm weapon of his to accurately shoot you. The weight and the recoil makes it difficult and he’s not very accurate and begins firing everywhere randomly in your AND Frankie’s direction.\n\nYou’re still airborn heading towards Igor and now Frankie as well who’s somehow gotten in front of you due to him being unable to stop himself at this point. This is fortunate since this causes Frankie to block most of the randomly fired bullets with his body. You still take a couple in the leg though.\n\n“OH SHIT! Igor yells as Frankie slams into him and the floor at terrific speed. You don’t fair much better since you crash into the back of Frankie which is pretty hard due to the metal plating. It hurts like hell and you crawl off as quickly as possible while Frankie attempts to recover. Igor isn’t recovering as quickly; he’s bleeding from every orifice and whatever cybernetic parts he had can go to the scrap yard.\n\nYou’re in great pain and you got some silver bullets in your leg, but you need to act.\n"
