  "Old monsters never die, they just get meaner.\nAdditional Notes:\nThere are history links for each monster (In the form of your character\u0027s memories) and while not neccessary to understand the story, they do provide deeper background. Ignore whatever you might know about various old movie monsters, you\u0027ll find that most of their histories are much different in this story.\nYou may find that this story has a movie feel to it which is appropriate considering the characters involved. The language (and violence) can get graphic sometimes, so if you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you probably shouldn\u0027t read it.\nFinally this isn\u0027t really a \"win/lose\" type story, however there are definitely good/bad/neutral endings. A few endings are even \"really good\" though they won\u0027t be spelled out as such."
