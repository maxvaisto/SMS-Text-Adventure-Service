  "page 123": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nSouth.\n\n\nGoing by what you learned, all you have to do is head directly south. After all the time you spent wondering where Arboribus could possibly be, finding out that it was just south quite frankly appalled you. You didn\u0027t think it would be so easy. Hell, you probably could have found this place on your own if you wandered in the right direction. \n\n\nWell, you assume you\u0027ll find it south based on the information you have. If it turns out to be wrong, then you\u0027ll  be really upset. \n\n\nFortunately for you, however, four days after you start heading south, and in the middle of the day, you see it.\n\n\nDespite having a wealth of wood ready for use, the city of Arboribus is a city of stone. Low rising walls mark the borders of the city, but the city is so large that you can\u0027t even see the other side of it from where you look. Guards walk the walls without vigilance, Their eyes wander everywhere but where they should be. They\u0027ve grown accustomed to never being attacked, and so only have guards, you guess, as a policing force. \n\n\nYou can\u0027t see much beyond the walls aside from barely peaking roofs of stone structures. Well, those, and the massive tree in the center of the city. It rises well above any wall, and above any castle you\u0027ve seen back in your realm. Stone staircases weave their way in and around the tree, but those aren\u0027t the most notable things about it. It\u0027s the massive hole in the Center of the tree that takes the cake there. Even from where you stand, you can see that the tree was hollowed out, and, guessing from the location of the tree, you can only assume that\u0027s where the acting ruler lives.\n\n\nYour heart pounds in your chest as you take in the magnificent city. Anticipation shakes you to your core, as well as relief that you\u0027ve finally found the city. Deeper than these, however, is the feeling of fear: fear of the unknown, fear for Liliana, fear that she won\u0027t want to come back with you, and, muse forbid, fear that Liliana isn\u0027t even alive. \n\n\nThe last time you felt such emotion was a long time ago in a memory you often choose to forget...\n",
  "page 122": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou are not about to make a deal with some other wordly being. For all you know it could require you to sacrifice your firstborn child to it when you save Liliana. No, you\u0027ll just find Arboribus on your own. \n\n\n\"I refuse.\" \n\n\nThe being\u0027s shadows twist and contort in what you assume to be frustration, but the voice doesn\u0027t change. \"Very well. I am a noble being, so I will not punish you for refusing me.\" \n\n\nIt sounds like it\u0027s trying to convince itself to not punish you. \n\n\n\"In fact. I am feeling very generous today, so I will give you this piece of information. Arboribus lies to the south.\" The being waves an incorporeal hand south. \n\n\nYou smile gratefully. \"Thank you,\" you tell it before you start heading that direction. \n\n\n\"I wonder,\" its voice grows more quiet as you walk. \"is your love strong enough to withstand what comes next?\"\n\n\nYou turn back to face the being, but it is already gone. \n",

She\u0027s a capable person, and you\u0027re sure that she\u0027ll be able to save your wife. \n\n\nYou tell Raynalixa as much, and she accepts your answer. All that is left for you do now is wait.\n\n\nYear 388 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe cavern is cold, and forebodingly so. This is the abode of the Ice King Fraeyrus. His gargantuan body lies in the center of the cavern, and, upon your entering, his eyes open. \n\n\nOver the past ten years, you\u0027ve lost all hope of anyone finding you. You didn\u0027t want to stay imprisoned here forever, so this was your only viable option as an escape.\n\n\nYou greet the king, \"Fraeyrus, I come seeking a fav-\" You\u0027re interrupted when a blast of ice breath freezes you solid.\n",
  "page 245": "Year 422 of the Second Era\n\n\nTime heals all wounds. Well, time, but, a goddess to warm your bed helps too. You don\u0027t know how you managed to stay strong during those ten years without Raynalixa. \n\n\nThose ten years went by agonizingly slow, for the temptation of Raynalixa was always there. She made the fact that you could break the deal off and marry her anytime you wanted to very clear, and that fact nearly drove you crazy. But somehow, somehow, you managed to keep your side of the deal. \n\n\nIt was after that, when you two got married, that things became interesting. As one of the muses, and therefore a powerful being of creation, she was able to bind your life force to hers thereby making you effectively immortal. From that point onward she taught you all manner of spells, fighting techniques, and pretty much anything you could ever want to know. It keeps you occupied, and when the two of you aren\u0027t working on honing your skills or trying to find a way out of the prison, you spend your time in between the bedsheets. You would think that after forty-four years of sex, you might get bored of it, but you don\u0027t. Raynalixa is very creative. \n\n\nTime goes on, and you end up learning to love Raynalixa and your life here. You devote the rest of your immortal life to finding a way out of the prison, and Raynalixa does the same. \n\n\nAnd if, by some chance, you will never be freed, then you think you\u0027d be okay with spending the rest of eternity with her. Your own personal muse.\n",
  "page 127": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n\"Where is Liliana?\" you ask. It is a simple question, but perhaps the most important of all of them. How can you save her if you don\u0027t know where she is?\n\n\n\"Arboribus,\" it answers simply.\n\n\nWhen it doesn\u0027t expound, you continue, \"Where is Arboribus?\"\n\n\n\"A few miles south of here.\" \n\n\n\"How?\" you ask it almost reflexively. Surely it isn\u0027t that easy. Maybe some magical barrier is guarding it, and perhaps that would keep you from getting in. Otherwise Arboribus would\u0027ve been mapped already.\n\n\nYou ask the thing as much. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re right. There is a magical barrier, but you progressed beyond that point a long time ago.\" A look of confusion goes over your face, so it expounds, \"The barrier is meant to keep outsiders out, and allow for insiders to get back in. You need only carry an object that was created in Arboribus in order to get through the barrier. After that, getting to Arboribus is easy.\" \n\n\n\"But I don\u0027t ha-\" you start, but then the being raises a, incorporeal finger and points it at your left hand. \n\n\nYou look down to see Liliana\u0027s ring on your finger. Its emerald color fits right in with the green of the forest. \"Oh,\" is all you say.\n",
  "page 129": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n\"How do I save her?\" You are utterly unexperienced in the ways of Arboribus and Faeries. For all you know, you could have to sacrifice a baby on a shrine to free Liliana from her captors. You shake that morbid thought away as the being answers.\n\n\n\"Just kill the person who captured her. A simple blade will do it.\"\n\n\nYou ponder that for a moment. \"Who captured her?\" This is another question that had been bugging you ever since she was captured.\n\n\n\"In Arboribus, the city of faeries, there is a king. Oops, I meant there was a king. This king was Liliana\u0027s father, but he died recently making Liliana the rightful heir to the throne. The ambitious among the faerie decided to use this as an opportunity to seize control of the city, and to make themselves king. The city split into factions, and a civil war ensued. None of the factions could gain an upper hand, but there was one among the leaders who had a brilliant idea.\"\n\n\nThe being pauses for effect.\n\n\n\"His name is Torinal. One of the best faerie warriors in all of Arboribus, he decided that he and his band of warriors were best suited for leading, and he was doing fine with his pendant, but he lacked numbers. Torinal, in the midst of the city\u0027s strife, remembered that there was one way to legitimize his claim on the throne without fighting. Through marriage. If he could find the lost princess and marry her, then no one could doubt him.\" \n\n\n\"And he found her,\" you whisper. \"How long do I have?\" you ask the question frantically.\n\n\nThe being doesn\u0027t answer.\n\n\n\"Dammit, I don\u0027t know what you are, or why you\u0027re helping me, but you know things that I don\u0027t.\" You try to reach out and put your hand on its shoulder, but your hand phases right through its body. Still, you continue, \"I  need to know how long I have until he forces the marriage.\"\n\n\nThe being hesitates, as if it doesn\u0027t know whether it should share the information with you. Eventually, however, it does. \"One month. That\u0027s the maximum amount of time you have before Torinal forces the wedding through.\" \n\n\nYour heart leaps. You thought you could be days away from it, but a month? This is good. This is safe. You have plenty of time to walk a few miles to the city, plan an escape route, then execute that plan. It wasn\u0027t long now.\n",
  "page 128": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n\"What did you mean when you said I\u0027d be in trouble \u0027from\u0027 Liliana?\" The being said it very confidently, so you don\u0027t think it misspoke. And you don\u0027t think it lied either, or if it did, then it was a filthy liar from the start and you were screwed from the beginning.\n\n\n\"What do you know of magic?\" \n\n\n\"Not much. What does that have to do with an-\" The being raises a shadow of a hand and your mouth is magically closed again. \n\n\n\"Magic cannot be used by everyone. Correct, or incorrect? Nod for the former.\" \n\n\nYou don\u0027t even have to think for that one. Everyone knew magic was only limited to those who were born in the Realm of Magic.You nod, but the being shakes its shadowy head in disappointment. \n\n\n\"This is a common misconception. Anyone can use magic. You just have to have the right tools, and, unluckily for you, the person that captured your beloved has one of these tools. This particular tool can be used to charm people, so you\u0027ll likely be dealing with an uncooperative wife when you get there,\"\n\n\nYou try to respond, but the magic still keeps your mouth shut. With the wave of a hand, the being removes the spell, and you immediately start asking questions.\n\n\n\"Are you saying that Liliana is under a spell?\" You ask the question, but don\u0027t leave any time for it to respond before launching into another one. \"So I could be trying to rescue someone who doesn\u0027t want to be rescued?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m saying that she could be. Charm spells are highly dependent on the target\u0027s willpower, so she could be entirely against you when you get there.\" \n\n\nYou look down, as you brainstorm ways to fix this mess of a situation. \n\n\n\"They say that love gives men power beyond all else. This begs the question. How confident are you in your wife\u0027s love for you?\" \n\n\nThe question pierces the otherwise silent air of the clearing, and you let it go unanswered. You prefer not to dwell on the possibility of failure.\n",
  "page 77": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou pull the palm sized ruby out of the folds of your clothes within your armor, and show it to them.\n\n\nIt is only then that you remember that you got the ruby from looting their dead friends corpse, so their reactions make sense. \n\n\nHenrik moves blindingly fast. He grips the top of your breastplate and shoves you against the edge of the ramparts. Following this, he grips his halberd and shoves the spear point up against your throat. Flavius just stand and watches with a blank expression upon his face. Henrik then leans forward toward you, and whispers angrily in your ear.\n\n\n\"Have you shown that to anyone else?\" Somehow you manage to hold onto the gem throughout all of this.\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\nHenrik eyes you carefully, then presses his spear point into your throat a little bit more. \"Are you sure about that?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, I swear on the Muse,\"  you quickly respond. \n\n\nThat seems to satisfy Henrik, and he pulls is halberd away from your throat, then pulls you fully back onto the wall. \n\n\n\"What was that about?\" you ask them cautiously. \n\n\nThe pair of them exchange a look between them, and Henrik steps forward to you once more. \"You, Meet us at the bottom of that,\u0027 he points to the watchtower closest to your barracks, \"watchtower tonight at midnight. Your life depends on it. And bring the gem.\"\n\n\nSomehow you get the feeling that this isn\u0027t a message of helping you survive some curse imbued on you by the gem. No, that was very distinctly a threat. You take a gulp  of air down your throat. That did not at all go as you intended it to.\n\n\n\"Come on Flavius. our shift is over.\" Henrik motions for Flavius to follow him, and together the pair of them leave the ramparts.\n\n\nWhen they\u0027re out of sight, you take the opportunity and rest your back against the side of the ramparts. Adrenaline courses through your veins, but after a short while your heart stops racing. It is then that you eye the knife in your right hand. Henrik might be fast, and you might even lose against him in a real fight, but if he\u0027d really intended to kill you he\u0027d have been dead. You feel relived, for despite that last encounter with the pair, you rather liked them. \n\n\nWith all that happened the past few minutes, you\u0027re left with very few choices to make. If they were serious about their death threat, then you could be dead before morning, but you did get a lot of the information you needed. You could probably sneak away and finally set after Liliana without them noticing.\n",

  "page 78": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThese guys could be your best hope of finding Liliana, and you\u0027re pretty sure they won\u0027t kill you tonight.\n\n\nAt least, you hope not.\n\n\nThe rest of the day passes without incident. Physically you are calm, normal considering you were just surrounded by the deaths of many people. Mentally, however,  you are a storm. Information, choices, and hopes swirl in your mind as you finish the day off. Evening comes quickly, and you spend the time before the meeting planning potential routes through the Lost Realm. You want to be prepared in the event you have to leave quickly. \n\n\nAs the meeting draws near, your heart starts pumping faster, and you start to have second thoughts. You get over them quickly enough, but you maintain your wariness. Better to be safe than sorry. This is your state of mind when you sneak out past curfew and head to the designated watchtower. You pass a few guards on the way, but none stop you, and none, luckily for you, are posted at the doors of the watchtower. You do find it odd though.\n\n\nInside the tower, it is eerily quiet at night, and the sound of your steel boots hitting the stone stairs reverberates throughout. Several times you think you hear guards shuffling towards, but you guess it\u0027s the nerves, for no guards ambush you. Henrik doesn\u0027t appear either, so you assume he (and likely the rest of the group)  must be at the bottom. When you do reach the bottom a large iron gate-like door greets you. You see no one in front of the door, so you assume they must be under the stairwell. Before you can turn around, however, a gloved hand covers your mouth and its partner presses a dagger to your throat. \n\n\n\"Make a sound or struggle, and leave your sorry ass in a puddle of blood.\" The voice is clearly feminine, so you can only assume its the woman in their group. You immediately become docile. You aren\u0027t about to die from some dagger happy woman with a penchant for killing. \n\n\nShe walks backward with you until the pair of you are completely under the bottom of the stairwell. There it is bright. They have enough torches to light the area comfortably, but not enough to alert guards that happen to be passing by. The area itself is no larger than a seven by seven foot square, but these guys managed to fit a table, chairs, and a barrel of ale in it. You briefly wonder how they were able to pull this off without any guards noticing, but then you remember how you, oddly enough, didn\u0027t run into any guards on the way here. Paid off. \n\n\nThey move quickly, you think as you take stock of the room\u0027s inhabitants. There are four chairs at the table. The one closest to you is empty, but the rest are filled. There\u0027s a chair for each side. Flavius sits in the chair on your left side of the room. Henrik sits on the far side of the room, and their last member, likely the youngest member of their party, sits on your right.\n\n\n\"Have a seat.\" Henrik speaks with a solemn voice, and has an expression on his face that matches it. Flavius, however, is different. A smile, although not the widest, sits upon his face. The smile gives you hope. Maybe you won\u0027t die after all. The other guy\u0027s face is expressionless, but his eyes focus on you, so you at least know he\u0027s paying attention. \n\n\nThe woman holding you shoves you slightly forward, so you take the cue and fall into the empty seat. You glance behind you to the woman, and your eyes meet hers, which are cold and hard. She leans against a wall and twirls a dagger in her hand. She\u0027s their insurance, so you don\u0027t escape.\n\n\n\"Take the gem out.\" Henrik\u0027s instructions are clear, simple even. \n\n\nYou comply. The gem is slightly warm from being on your person, but other than that nothing else is different from the first time you laid your eyes on it. You set it on the middle of the table, and almost before you can pull your hand back Flavius darts his hand forward and grabs it. He has a slightly crazed look in his eyes, which, when compared to his usual demeanor, leaves him looking rather obsessed. \n\n\n\"You may leave now.\" \n\n\nHenrik\u0027s voice startles you. Not so much by the fact that he spoke at all, but by what he said. \n\n\n\"What?\" Astonishment creeps into your voice. Surely, there was more to this moment than simply giving them the gem and leaving. \n\n\n\u0027You heard me. You are free to go. So go.\" There is a slight threat in his voice.\n\n\nYou ignore it. \n\n\n\"I need more information. I don\u0027t care about anything else, but I need to know how to traverse that cursed forest.\" You gaze around the room, and at each person in turn. \"Surely one of you can help me.\"\n\n\nThe room is silent for a moment. Then Flavius speaks, \"I retract my earlier assessment. I think we could use him.\" \n\n\nHenrik responds first. \"We already decided this. We don\u0027t need some greenhorn guard following us around everywhere.\" \n\n\nThe guy on your right speaks up. \"No, I change my vote as well. He has a fire in his eyes. Passion is a weapon as sharp as any blade.\"\n\n\nHenrik groans. \"Not you too Seram.\" \n\n\nSeram shrugs. \n\n\nFlavius\u0027 smile changes into a grin. \"We have a tie then. Will you change your vote as well Borra?\" \n\n\nYou turn your head to hear her response. \"No, mine is the same. The blade of passion has no place in a forest of death. Experience is the better blade. Seram and Borra stare each other down for a second, but Seram eventually looks away. \n\n\n\"I maintain my vote,\" is all Seram says before looking down at the ground. \n\n\n\"We are at an impasse then?\" Flavius asks the others. \n\n\nHenrik shakes his head in disappointment before speaking, \"Fine, let\u0027s put him through the trial. If he fares well there, then we can allow him to be with us. Agreed?\" Everyone nods their agreement. \n\n\nYou must\u0027ve missed something. You hadn\u0027t outright said you wanted to be a part of their group, and you definitely didn\u0027t want to if they weren\u0027t going back into the Lost Realm. Henrik seemed pretty adamant about not going back after all.\n\n\nYou say as much. \"I don\u0027t want to be a part of this group if you aren\u0027t going to go back into the Lost Realm.\"\n\n\nFlavius chuckles. \u0027We are my friend. Don\u0027t you worry about that.\" \n\n\nThen Henrik continues, \"This is the last chance we\u0027ll give you to back out before we put you through the trial. Once we get there, there is no going back.\"\n\n\nThey await your decision.\n",
  "page 71": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThis is that griffin knight. The one you saved in yesterday\u0027s battle. You knew that crazy, reckless plan was the right thing to do, and now it has given you more than just the opportunity to win a battle. It has given you the opportunity to save your beloved.\n\n\n\"Your service will be very much appreciated. Yes, I accept.\" \n\n\nFor the slightest moment you feel that leading this knight into one of the most dangerous places in the four realms for your own personal reasons might be a little...wrong, but then you remember Liliana\u0027s azure eyes, the feeling of her body curled up against yours, and the soft, caring sound of her voice, and you no longer feel guilty. \n\n\nThe female knight raises her head first, and then, with reverence, slowly rises to her feet. \n\n\n\"Very well master. What would you have me do?\" \n\n\nYou mentally grimace at her use of the word master, but it\u0027s a small price to pay in order to use this knight. You then go into an in depth explanation of why you want to venture into the Lost Realm, and what her place would be in such an endeavor, but when you begin to explain that she was to drop you off in the forest once you passed the borderlands, she argues.\n\n\n\"Forgive me, master, but it would go against my oath to leave you in that godforsaken place alone. I will continue with you the whole way, or we shall not use my griffin,\" she states.\n\n\n\"Aren\u0027t I the master here? Doesn\u0027t your oath require that you obey me?\" You hate to have to pull the master card so early, but it seemed necessary. \n\n\nThe knight disagrees again, \"No. My first duty is to protect you. Everything else comes secondary. Thus, me leaving you alone in there,\" she gestures loosely to the other side of the wall, \"would be more of a transgression than it would be to disobey you.\" \n\n\nYou eye her carefully. She has to look up to meet your eyes, and her chin is tilted slightly in obstinacy. A small vertical scar mars the right side of her jaw, and, for a moment, you get distracted by it. Enough, in fact, that on impulse you lift a hand to touch the side of her face. \n\n\n\"What happened here?\" She doesn\u0027t jerk away from your touch, but she doesn\u0027t react to it either. \n\n\n\"I\u0027d prefer not to say, master.\" \n\n\nYou nod, and your hand falls away from her face. \"Fine. You can accompany me the entire way. We leave at the end of the week.\" You think briefly about what Liliana will think of you saving her with a griffin knight, and then about what she\u0027ll think of you wandering through the Lost Realm at the side of some maiden. You dread that conversation. \n\n\n\"Master?\" The knight draws your attention back to her. A dimpled smile stretches across her face. \n\n\n\"Yes?\" \n\n\n\"Forgive me. I\u0027ve forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Emelyne.\" She extends her arm towards you, and you grasp your forearm with hers. \"Might I know yours? Or do you actually prefer me to call you master?\" \n\n\nYou shake your head. \"No I\u0027d prefer it if you call me by my name. Master seems too...laviscious.\" \n\n\nShe nods her agreement, then you tell her your name. After that, you two part ways, and decide to meet on the morrow. You two have a lot of things to get done if you want to leave by the end of the week.\n",

You ask yourself this, but as you do, your thoughts turn back to yesterday\u0027s events. Wherein you leaped from the clutches of a griffin, on top of a passing wyvern, to save one griffin and its rider. Could these really be the very same people?\n\n\nStill kneeling, and still with her head bowed she repeats,\"You, having saved mine and Adroxius\u0027 lives, have proven yourself worthy of our service.

You\u0027ve had your wife taken away, so you are no stranger to sadness either. They could deal with a few questions. \n\n\nYour steel boots clang across the stone wall as you make your way toward them. The overweight man, looks at you as you approach, but halberd guy continues looking at the forest. Despite this, he is the first one to speak.\n\n\n\"Back again?\" Mr. Halberd glances in your direction once before returning his gaze back to the forest. \n\n\n\"Again?\" His companion asks curiously.\n\n\nYou nod. \"Yes we are already acquainted with each other.\" \n\n\nA smile breaks out across the mace wielder\u0027s face. \"A friend then?\" He sticks his arm out toward you, and the pair of you clasp arms. \"The name is Flavius.\"\n\n\n\"My name is-\" You start to introduce yourself, but are quickly cut off by the halberd man. \n\n\n\"He\u0027s no friend.\"\n\n\n\"All the same,\" Flavius says and he winks in your direction. Apparently halberd guy\u0027s demeanor wasn\u0027t just directed toward you. \"What can we do for you?\"\n\n\nYou turn toward the large expanse of forest before you. \"You see that?\" You say the pair of them. \n\n\n\"Naked nymph?\" They both respond at the same time, and with the same phrase. Neither breaks into a bout of laughter, so you can only assume that the reason they were staring at the forest so intently was not because they were into their guard duty.\n\n\nStill, you choke back a laugh. \"No. Not a naked nymph.\" They both visibly and audibly sigh. \"That,\" you point for emphasis, \"right there is a prison.\"\n\n\nNeither of them say anything, so you continue. \"There is someone I need to break out of there, but I have no idea how to get in. Let alone get out with that person.\" \n\n\nThey maintain their silence. \n\n\n\"Could you guys help me?\" After giving it some thought last night, you decided that the best way to approach the adventurers was to ask them for help as a blanket statement. With any luck, they\u0027d be willing to not only give you information, but take you through the edge of the forest without having to kill hordes of kobold. Without luck they still might give you information. You\u0027d take anything at this point. \n\n\nThey respond at the same time again, but this time they say different things. \n\n\n\"Of course,\" Flavius says. \n\n\n\"No,\" halberd guy says simply.\n\n\nFlavius continues, \"Don\u0027t pay Henrik much attention. Of course we\u0027ll help you.\" \n\n\nThe guy with the halberd, Henrik, as it turns out, responds, \"No we will not. We\u0027re not going to risk our lives again for some stranger looking for a mythical city.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, You want to get to Arboribus?\" Flavius asks as he turns to you. \n\n\nYou are very quick to respond. \"Yes. Can you get me there?\"\n\n\nA chortle of laughter escapes Flavius\u0027 lips. \"Of course not. No one knows how to get there-\"\n\n\nHenrik inputs, \"Because it doesn\u0027t exist,\" but Flavius continues.\n\n\n\"-but I do know someone who can.\" Flavius nods a matter of factly. \"Yes there is someone who can get you there. Unfortunately for us, we don\u0027t know where she is, nor how to get into her palace should we find her.\"\n\n\n\"Find who?\"\n\n\nYou ask this innocently, but Henrik gives you a look of loathing. \"Don\u0027t get him st-\"\n\n\nHenrik is promptly interrupted by Flavius. \"Why only the most beautiful, most powerful, and the most knowledgeable person in all of the Lost Realm! The Muse of fire herself, Raynalixa!\"  \n\n\nA muse?  you think in wonder. The muses were powerful beings of creation. They were said to preside over each of the four realms. One in each. Many of the religions of this era are based upon the muses in some way, shape, or form. If this really was a muse, then she\u0027d definitely know the way to Arboribus. This thought gives you hope, and you give Flavius one of your rare smiles. Rare since Liliana went missing, anyhow. \n\n\n\"But you said you don\u0027t know where she is?\" You ask.\n\n\nA frown comes over his face. \"Well, we know the general area, and we could even take you there-\"\n\n\nYour smile turns into a grin...\n\n\n\"-for a price.\"\n\n\n...that fades as Flavius finishes his sentence.\n\n\nHenrik speaks next. \"And there\u0027s the silver lining for you. even if we wanted to help you, which we don\u0027t, I doubt you have anywhere near enough money to purchase our services.\"\n\n\n\"Hold on one second there,\" Flavius interjects. \"If this person really means a lot to him, then I\u0027m sure he could find some way to make up the price.\" \n\n\nThey both look at you expectantly.\n",

What monstrous favor could some incorporeal being of darkness and shadow come up with for you to do? \n\n\n\"Alright. I have all of the information I need. What is it that you want?\" \n\n\nThe being doesn\u0027t say a word. Instead, it waves its hand and tendrils of darkness fall away from its body and into the air in front of you. These tendrils form four hand size figures in the air. \n\n\n\"In the beginning, four muses were created to keep peace all across the land. Each muse was assigned a portion of land to preside over,\" You\u0027d heard this before. This was a standard belief among religious people throughout all of the realms. \n\n\n\"But, as time went on, the muses got greedy. They forgot what their purpose was, and turned against each other in war.\" This, however, you\u0027d never heard before.\n\n\nThe four figures in the air begin fighting with one another, and more shadows join the fray. Shadows that mold into dragons, giants, wizards, and knights in shining armor. \n\n\n\"Eventually the \u0027One.\u0027 The being at the start of all creation, took notice of their antis, and created a new muse. This one was more powerful than the rest, and the One had this muse imprison the rest of the muses inside their realms. I need you to find the prison here, in the Realm of the Lost, and-\"\n\n\n\"Free her.\" You finish its thought for it, but the being shakes its head in disagreement. \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t need you to free her. Were you listening? These muses are corrupt. No, I don\u0027t need you to free her.\" The shadowy figures representing the muses fall apart and return to the being\u0027s body. \"I need you to kill her.\"\n\n\nHis request shakes your soul. Your very being rebels against the idea of killing someone that mankind has considered sacred, yet what choice do you have? You agreed to this things deal. Following through would be the honest thing to do, but could you really kill a deity? The answer is no. You can\u0027t. \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t know who you think I am, but I\u0027m only human. I can\u0027t kill a god,\" you tell the being. \n\n\n\"The muses are no gods. Immortal, and deadly powerful beings, perhaps, but not gods.\" \n\n\nYou shake your head. \"Doesn\u0027t matter. I can barely kill a few kobold without getting killed. What makes you think I could kill a muse?\"\n\n\nThe being doesn\u0027t say anything. Instead, more shadows fall off from its body. These shadows form into a ball in the air, and it plucks that ball from the air and into its hands. From there, it pounds, kneads, and shapes the ball until it forms into the shape of a dagger. When it takes on that shape, the shadows solidify and the dagger floats in the air. Through the use of magic, the being pushes the dagger through the air in front of you.\n\n\n\"Take it, for it is with this dagger that you will kill her. It is fatal to muses, and the wielder is protected from magic. The fire magic of Raynalixa, the muze of this realm, will be useless against you. You have everything you need to do me this favor.\" The dagger drops into your hands.\n\n\nYou try to say something, but the being keeps on speaking. \"Follow this horse one last time, and it will take you to her prison. Kill her, and this horse will take you to Arboribus. Do this and you will have your wife back.\" \n\n\nYou try to speak again, but it says one last thing. \"Do not disappoint me.\"\n\n\nThe tone of its voice is so commanding, and threatening that the question that you were going to ask is left unspoken on your lips. What if I refuse?\n\n\nThe being doesn\u0027t say another word. The shadows forming its body fall apart and return to whence they came. You are left alone in the middle of the clearing. You look at the dagger in your hands. It is completely black, from the start of the hilt to the point of the blade. You put it in your pack and look around. \n\n\nThe dark horse waits for you at the north edge of the clearing, directly opposite of the way you\u0027re supposed to be going. You were supposed to be saving Liliana. Not fulfilling wishes of a deity. \n\n\nYou wonder if you shouldn\u0027t just refuse entirely and just focus on saving Liliana.\n",

Though you don\u0027t know its purpose, you can\u0027t help but feel sympathy for it, so despite the dark horse\u0027s prominent majesty, you walk after the white horse. The dark horse doesn\u0027t follow.\n\n\nThere is no running this time. No fevered attempts to touch the horse or to leap upon its back. You just follow the horse from several feet back. Even when wounded the beast is magnificent, and your eyes are drawn away from the slinking trees that droop menacingly, and vines that try and bar your way after the horse. \n\n\nTime passes, and the horse\u0027s wounds become less and less noticeable until the horse is walking normally again. When it reaches this point, the horse turns around and faces you. For a solid moment you stare into each other\u0027s eyes, and when the moment passes the horse bows itself before you in what you can only assume is an invitation for you to ride it.\n\n\nOne that you do not refuse.\n\n\nYou press your legs into the sides of the bare horse in an attempt to stay on. Its silky mane sifts through your fingers as you grip it, and for one blissful moment you sit atop it without any worry. That feeling disappears when it moves.\n\n\nAt first it walks, but then it starts to canter, and soon enough it\u0027s sprinting at full speed. Your heart drops at the sudden change of pace, and you struggle to stay on the horse without a saddle, but somehow you manage. \n\n\nDespite having already began sprinting, the horse picks up more and more speed until you can\u0027t see anything but blurred darkness around you. Magic. You watch in hopes of being able to glimpse something magical, but your eyes tear up from the rushed wind and you\u0027re forced to close them. You keep them closed, and the horse keeps on riding.\n\n\nYou continue like this for an indeterminate amount of time before the horse starts to slow down. You wait until the horse is at a full stop, and then you open your eyes. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t know how far you\u0027ve traveled, but you definitely don\u0027t recognize anything around you. At some point in the travels, you and the horse entered into mountainous terrain, and the horse itself is stopped in front of the largest mountain you\u0027ve ever seen. Trees still cover a large portion of it, but its peak rises above those trees and gives the world of green a nice change of color. Or at least, you assume it would if it wasn\u0027t so dark. \n\n\nThe horse only stops for a moment before walking again. This time the pace is rather slow, and you have time to gaze into the darkness around you. Not that you see much, but you at least have the chance to make out some of the images blurred by darkness. You don\u0027t make out much, but you do make out the side of the mountain as the horse walks toward it. \n\n\nAt first you are impressed by the sheer size of the mountain, then you are confused at why the horse continues walking toward the mountain even though you are little more than feet away from it. This continues to appall you up until the very moment that the horse touches the wall, or should have touched the wall. instead of walking into the side of the mountain like you supposed you would, you and the horse simply faze through the side of it into a cave. You\u0027d hoped to see something magical, and here it is.\n\n\nTorches line the walls of the cave illuminating it quite well. At the end of the cave is a massive golden double door. It stands about double your height wide, and triple your height high. An engraving of a mighty dragon is emblazoned upon the front of the door, and in the center of the double doors is a hole about the size of your palm. \n\n\nCuriosity overtakes you, so you hop off of the horse and walk up to the door. It is even more magnificent up close than it is farther away, but, as you near, it isn\u0027t what you see that astounds you. rather, it is what you hear.\n\n\nA voice, more pure and perfect than anything you\u0027ve ever heard prior, sounds through the door. It sings a beautiful song. One that you set to memorize even as you hear it.\n\n\n\"Queen of the lost\n\n\nlies in a cave.\n\n\nTrapped by the king of frost\n\n\nshe must be saved.\n\n\nA key of ruby unlocks the way\n\n\nand through golden doors\n\n\nyour muse awaits.\"\n\n\nDesire to hear that voice closer to you consumes you. You pound at the door hoping, praying that the person beyond the door can hear you, but the doors don\u0027t open. You try several different ideas to open the door, but none of them work. Eventually you stop trying and sit with your back against the door. \n",
  "page 111": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe white horse is wounded, weak even, compared to the dark horse. Why follow the weak when you could follow the strong?\n\n\nYou reach out to the horse, and unlike the white horse, it doesn\u0027t shy away from you. Your hands meet the soft, almost glowing, mane of the horse. It is a picture of equestrian perfection, and you find yourself in awe of its majesty. This feeling overtakes you, and you want nothing more than to ride this wonderful thing. \n\n\nSo you do.\n\n\nYou press your legs into the sides of the bare horse in an attempt to stay on. Its silky mane sifts through your fingers as you grip it, and for one blissful moment you sit atop it without any worry.

It is a beautiful setting, and you feel peace as you look around the area. This peace disappears when you see shadows in the middle of the clearing start to change. \n\n\nYour heart drops as you see various shadows from all across the clearing start to gather into the center of the clearing, and, unfortunately for you, this includes the magical horse. You fall a few feet to the grass, as the entirety of the horse is sucked towards the center of the clearing. The horse is torn apart into smaller pieces of shadow, but there is no blood. No guts or anything. It\u0027s as if the horse simply separated and joined the gathering of shadows, and likely the weirdest thing you\u0027ve seen this night.\n\n\nThe shadows and darkness in the center of the clearing gather for just a moment longer before they start to coalesce. When it is all finally done, a humanoid figure stands in the center of the clearing. Darkness is its skin, and shadow its heart. It has no features. Just the basic limbs of a human, but you can see nothing else decipherable through its sheer darkness. The sky at night can\u0027t even compare to the depth of dark this...being represents.\n\n\nIt raises a formless hand and motions for you to come closer. \n",

The voice is surprisingly normal. It\u0027s deep, and quite obviously that of a male, but such a normal voice coming from such an abnormal being makes it even creepier. \n\n\nDespite this, you move closer until you aren\u0027t even a foot away.

The hallway doesn\u0027t change, but you do start hearing humming. It sounds like the perfect sounding voice from before, so you start walking in earnest.\n\n\nEventually, the hallway widens out into a large room. You hear the trickle of water and the soft splashes indicative of someone bathing. Normally you would leave a bathing person alone, but you have no idea where you are, and you are frankly in need of information.\n\n\nSteam filters throughout the air making it hard to see everything, but from what you can tell, the room is a series of large pools.

You can\u0027t help but stare. Now there is gorgeous, and then there is this woman. every aspect of her breathes perfection: her body, her posture, and everything else you can think to look at. It is all there. Her hair is as fire. No halfway orange colors. It is as if fire decided to stop burning and instead become a part of something even hotter than itself. \n\n\nHer very presence astounds you, and you find yourself not being able to do anything but stare. It is only when she sees you, and addresses you, that you find yourself able to speak.\n\n\n\"What noble hero art thou?\" She asks you in an older version of the language you speak. \n",

As soon as you turn, the being appears right in front of you. A few mere feet separate you from it, yet it is still as indescribable as before. Then it speaks.\n\n\n\"I won\u0027t bite.\" The voice is surprisingly normal. It\u0027s deep, and quite obviously that of a male, but such a normal voice coming from an abnormal being makes it even creepier.\n\n\n\"Come closer,\" it prompts you, and extends a hand towards you.\n",
  "page 236": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe owner of the voice is nowhere to be found, and you don\u0027t quite feel like waiting. Left is as good as any other direction, and so you pivot on your feet, and walk down the high ceilinged hallway. \n\n\nThe hallway doesn\u0027t turn or have any doors, so you continue onward in a straight line. The hallway itself doesn\u0027t change, but soon less torches line the walls and you find yourself wandering in darkness. You turn around to go the other direction, but suddenly there are no torches on that end either, and you are submerged in darkness. \n\n\n\"You weren\u0027t supposed to come over here...\" The musical voice from before appears from all directions at once. You whirl around in an attempt to glimpse anything in the darkness, but to no avail. \n\n\nYou hear the disembodied voice start to laugh, and fear enters your mind. You start to run down the darkness filled hallway in an attempt to get away from the voice, but the laughter stays with you. You run harder and faster until you trip over something and are sent sprawling. You search the floor for what you tripped over, and when you find it, you nearly retch your dinner up. It\u0027s a human skull. \n\n\nYou continue to wander in the hallway for what seems like days. The laughing eventually stops, but you aren\u0027t able to find a way out. you are lef to wander in that hallway for the rest of your days.\n",

Not even when you start to swing at it.\n\n\nIt is only moments before the sword hits you that you see anything, and even then you only see a dark blur. Immediately after you see the dark blur, your head goes flying from your shoulders. You die without knowing how, where, or who even killed you.\n",

If there\u0027s anyone with a chance of saving Liliana, it\u0027s you.\" \n\n\n\"But she\u0027s your wife!\" she raises her voice as she does this. \n\n\n\"But I\u0027m not as capable as you are. Besides, you think there\u0027s a even the smallest chance that I\u0027ll abandon you here?\" \n\n\n\"And you think I\u0027ll be fine abandoning you here?\"\n\n\nYou just look at her with a pleadingly. \"Please. Emelyne, I need you to do this for me. I\u0027ll find a way out, and I\u0027ll meet up with you later.\"\n\n\nShe stares coldly at you, but eventually responds, \"I hate that you\u0027re making me do this. Damn it all, fine.\" She thrusts a finger at your chest. \"But you better find a way out of here really quickly.\" \n\n\nYou nod, \"Of course.\" You hand her the ruby, which she takes and walks back through the door and into the cave.\n\n\nThe doors close after her, leaving you alone with the muse of fire. As if the very thought of her brings her to you, she appears by your side with a sympathetic smile. \"If you don\u0027t mind me asking, why is this Liliana person so important to you anyway?\"\n\n\nYou look at her, and are taken aback by her beauty. She seems to be even more perfect now than earlier. \n\n\n\"Well...\" you start before launching into your tale. You don\u0027t have anything else to do anyway.\n\n\nWhen you finish your story, Raynalixa\u0027s eyes are wet with tears, and a pout sits upon her face. \"That\u0027s horrible. That they would take your wife like that.\" She wipes her tears off with a sleeve. \"When i first saw you, I figured you were just another human without desires. Someone whose passions were driven only by greed. I like you, so I\u0027ll let you in on an important piece of information.\" \n\n\nYou nod, and gesture for her to continue. \n\n\n\"A long time ago, I found myself in love as well. When I was imprisoned here, that love was taken away from me. Hundreds of years have passed, and I still haven\u0027t found a way for me to escape by myself. Through that door,\" she points to the other side of the room to the other set of golden doors, \"is the only way for me to escape. Through that door lies an ice dragon by the name of Fraeyrus, and my prison is directly tied to its life force. Unfortunately, I cannot enter into that room, so someone else must kill him for me.\" \n\n\nShe looks you directly in the eyes. \"I\u0027ll be honest here. I don\u0027t know if an army of faeries could manage to kill that beast, let alone you by yourself. So here\u0027s my offer.\" She reaches over and takes one of your hands in hers. \"I want you to stay with me. We can wait for your companion to return, but if she doesn\u0027t return in ten years, then will you be my husband?\" \n\n\nYour heart dips, and you stand there frozen.\n\n\n\"I know my offer is sudden, and you likely think me scum for trying to steal a married man, but of all the people to have come here in the past thousand years, I like you the best.\" She looks away from you. \"You can refuse, but know that if your friend doesn\u0027t come back here to save you, then we\u0027ll be stuck in here until that dragon dies. We might as well warm up to each other.\"\n\n\nThe offer repeats in your head, and you don\u0027t know what to do. Your emotions tell you that you shouldn\u0027t betray Liliana even after ten years, but logically if you weren\u0027t rescued after ten years, then Emelyne was likely dead. If she was dead, then there was no hope for you getting out of this place except by killing that dragon. Who\u0027s to say that life with a muse would be such a bad thing?\n",

You stare into what would be its face, and if something like it could smile, you think it would. \n\n\n\"You are in trouble, my friend.\" It isn\u0027t a question.\n\n\n\"From you?\" you ask confused.\n\n\nIt shakes its head. A very human mannerism. \"No, not from me. From Liliana.\"\n\n\nYour heart drops. What does this...thing know? \"What do you mean \u0027from Liliana?\u0027 That doesn\u0027t make any sens-\" You are interrupted.\n\n\n\"One thing at a time, my friend.

As much as you hate to leave her here, it is necessary if you are going to save Liliana.\n\n\nYou grip Emelyne\u0027s shoulders, and pull her in for a hug. \"Thank you for everything you\u0027ve done for me. I will return for you.\" \n\n\nShe hugs you back. \"I will. Don\u0027t die, okay?\" \n\n\n\"I won\u0027t.\" You release her and turn back to the doors that lead to the cave. With one last look at Emelyne, and Raynalixa, you push through the doors and re-enter the cave. The doors close behind you, and you are left alone. It is still raining something terrible, so you feel quite stupid for leaving so soon. You sigh and settle yourself onto the cave floor. You want to get at least a short nap before you restart your journey.\n\n\nWhen you wake up, the storm is gone and everything outside is damp.

  "page 88": "Year 372 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe stench of alcohol permeates throughout the house. All throughout it are empty kegs, scattered furniture, and soiled clothes. It\u0027s a mess to say the least, Not that you would say anything, for your father would beat you if you did. Even at the age of sixteen, your father claimed the right to beat you senseless whenever he saw fit. He beat you when it was dirty, when it was clean, even when he was sober. You supposed it was a kind of addiction for your father as if he gained some sick sort of joy from beating someone younger than him. \n\n\nLiliana got pissed whenever she saw a new bruise on you. She insisted several times that she would go to your house and beat him herself if you didn\u0027t do something about it. You didn\u0027t, and she tried, she really did, but you would never let her leave. You\u0027d hug her until she relented, then hold her as if you were comforting her. In reality, you  were comforting yourself. \n\n\nYour father and you have a unique relationship. Ever since you mother died, your father entered a state of constant abusiveness, and, out of respect for your mother, you never retaliated. You still never retaliate, for deep down, you still believe he loves you. Even if it\u0027s in a deep and twisted way. You\u0027d hoped that today of all days, he would show that love, but he doesn\u0027t. He just lays on his bed in a drunken stupor refusing to do anything productive. He works in a local bar at night, so he at least has some excuse. That excuse doesn\u0027t really explain how he never cleans his house though, and why he insists upon leaving empty kegs everywhere. \n\n\nYou set to cleaning the house up. Today was a special day, and you didn\u0027t want it to be dirty for your guest. It\u0027s a fairly long process. Your father isn\u0027t good at many things, but he sure knows how to dirty up a house. The process is tedious, and a few minutes in you find your thoughts wandering. They go first to your plan for getting your father out of the house early, then to Liliana, then to your school work, and back to Liliana. Your thoughts always ended up back there. You never thought you could be as close to someone as you are to her, especially when at first they seemed to be kinda weird. \n\n\nShe used to always talk about her supposed home in the Lost Realm, and you indulged her conversations each time, but as you grew older you found yourself starting to doubt her claims. You\u0027d grown out of the fairytales your mother taught you. Liliana noticed this and stopped going on about her home. It was then that she began to entrench herself in your life. She couldn\u0027t go back to her home, wherever that was, so she formed her new home around you. The first few years were great, but then puberty happened and it became awkward. Fast forward to now and it was both great and awkward. The same friendship, but with more romantic tension than you\u0027d thought possible. You keep on hoping that she\u0027ll like you in the same way you like her, but she never gives any signs of it. Thus, you wait. Maybe one day...\n\n\nYou push the thoughts of Liliana from your head as you finish cleaning the house. The kegs are lined up against the wall, the floors are clear, and even the smell isn\u0027t as atrocious as it was an hour ago. Now the hard part. \n\n\nYou walk to your father\u0027s room and open the door. The stench in there is significantly stronger than in the rest of the house, and the room is dirtier as well. A keg, with a mug atop it, sits right beside the bed in the center of the room. Your father, a man your height with a beer belly and graying hair, lays on the bed. He snores loudly, so it\u0027s easy to sneak across the room and open the window. Outside, the sun is going down. That means it\u0027s time for your father to go to work.\n\n\nYou sigh and begin the process by taking his empty mug and refilling it with ale from the barrel. From there you give him a light shake, and when that doesn\u0027t work, a heavy one. He rouses from this one.\n\n\n\"Dammit kid what do you want?\" He lazily slaps at your face, but he\u0027s not quite sober, so his hand misses.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s time for you to go to work, sir.\" He smacks you when you don\u0027t call him sir. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll go to work whenever the hell I want. Gimme that.\" He snatches the mug from your hand and takes a large swig.\n\n\nAnd then another swig, and another until the entire mug is drained. He then throws it at your face. \"Refill it.\" \n\n\nYou comply. \"Father, I have a gift for you.\" \n\n\nHe takes the full mug from you and looks at you like you\u0027re crazy. \"What?\" \n\n\nHe isn\u0027t the brightest of people, so you figure you better show him instead. You pull a sack of coins out of your trouser pockets, and toss it to him. \"I saved up some money for you. I know how hard it is for you to work your job and I figured you could use some help,\" you lie to him. You just know that if he has money to spend then he\u0027ll leave to go to work earlier, and return home even later. \n\n\nHe grunts and gestures for you to leave. \n\n\nNext part of the plan is a success, and you didn\u0027t even get hit while doing it. Discounting the thrown mug of course. Now you just have to wait until he leaves. \n\n\nWhich, as it turns out, happens like you thought it would. He leaves much earlier than he usually does, and he doesn\u0027t even comment on the state of the house. Everything is going according to plan, so now all you have to do is wait.\n\n\nTen minutes go by, and then another, and before you know it, an hour has gone by. Yet, your guest hasn\u0027t shown up. You start pacing back and forth in front of the door, and eventually you hear rapping on your door. You immediately throw the door open, and there she is.\n\n\nHer onyx black hair cascades in black waves around her face which only serves to bring out the vibrant color of her stormy blue eyes. She wears an elegant dark black dress that stretches just past her knees. You look her over mentally checking to see if she\u0027d been in harmed since you last saw her. She hasn\u0027t, and you look back up to her face. A teasing smile stretches across her face, and you return it with a smile of your own. Liliana. \n\n\n\"Were you waiting at the door for me?\" She steps forward and wraps her arms around you in a close hug.\n\n\n\"Of course not,\" you reply. She doesn\u0027t seem convinced, however, so you continue, \"I just happened to be walking by.\" \n\n\nShe shakes her head lightly, stands on her tip toes, then whispers lightly in your ear, \"Happy birthday.\" \n\n\nShe then releases you from her hug and walks past you into the house. You\u0027re left with your heart pounding in your chest, and your cheeks flushed red. \n\n\n\"You already told me that today,\" you say as you follow her in. \n\n\n\"Saying it again won\u0027t hurt you. Besides this day only comes once a year. I should be saying it more often.\" She stands just inside the door and stares around. The house is clean for the most part, but an occasional stain from spilled ale mars the floors. \n\n\nShe walks slowly forward seemingly taking every detail in. She was the one who insisted upon coming to your house. \u0027You know about my home,\u0027 she\u0027d said \u0027so I should know about yours.\u0027\n\n\nThat was two years ago, and only now you finally gave in. \n\n\n\"This is nice,\" Liliana comments. \n\n\nYou scoff. \"You should\u0027ve seen it a couple of hours ago. This place was a dump, and will be again when my dad gets back.\" \n\n\nShe doesn\u0027t respond, and instead slowly makes her way through the house. It isn\u0027t the largest house, but her tour takes much longer than you think is necessary.\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s your room?\" She asks.\n\n\nYou point, \"Down that hallway.\" \n\n\nShe follows your instructions, and heads down the hallway, but when she gets to your door, she turns to the right and opens your father\u0027s door instead. \n\n\n\"No not that-\" you start, but by the time you say it, she\u0027s already walked into the room. \n\n\nShe, almost immediately, yells for you. \"What is that!\" It\u0027s a yell of horror and shock. \n\n\nYou didn\u0027t want her to see how disgusting your father is, and you feel a dreadful sense of embarrassment as you approach her. She stands just inside the doorway and stares at the ground in horror. Soiled clothes, spilled ale, and trash cover it. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry. I told you my father was a pig. I didn\u0027t want you to see this disgusting part of m-\"\n\n\nShe turns to you and interrupts. \"I don\u0027t care about the mess! I don\u0027t give a damn if your father is the most disgusting person in the realm.\" Tears start to form in her eyes. \"Just tell me that isn\u0027t what I think it is.\"\n\n\nShe points to the floor. You don\u0027t see what she\u0027s pointing at at first, but as you examine it further, you see a stain on the floorboards. Clothes cover the majority of it, but Liliana sets to work and starts moving the clothes out of the way. You don\u0027t stop her as she does so.\n\n\nShe spends a few minutes clearing the floor until a sizable portion is visible. She then turns back towards you with tears daring to fall out of her eyes. \"What is that?\"\n\n\nYou already know what the stain is, but you look over it anyway. It\u0027s large with seemingly no pattern to it, though it is largely circular in nature. It\u0027s a dark splotch, and if you weren\u0027t looking closely then you wouldn\u0027t be able to see the hint of red there. Blood, you think but don\u0027t say it. You don\u0027t need to confirm her suspicions.\n\n\nBut she knows you better than that. Refusal to answer is equivalent to answering in this case, so the tears in her eyes start falling. \"Why do you let him do this to you? He shouldn\u0027t be hurting you! You\u0027re his child!\" She practically screams this at you, but you aren\u0027t the one she\u0027s angry at. You don\u0027t blame her. If your mother saw this, then she would likely be screaming as well.\n\n\nYou\u0027d never felt inclined to answer her question before, but you do now. It comes out as a whisper, \"He\u0027s all I have left, Lily. He\u0027s my only family.\" You feel your eyes start to burn as well, but you hold back the tears. You don\u0027t want her to see you crying.\n\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t mean you let him beat you to death!\" She slaps you lightly on your arm. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t say anything, so she continues. \"I\u0027m here for you. I care for you. I ... I,\" She struggles to get this last part out. \"Dammit, I love you!\" \n\n\nHer proclamation resounds throughout the room, and your heart stutters. Her tear stained azure eyes stare into your own, and the room goes silent. The silence lasts only a second before you surge forward and pull her into a tight embrace. \"I love you too,\" You whisper to her. \"I love you too.\"\n\n\nYou pull back and look into her eyes. the evidence of tears is clear, but no longer is her expression sad. A smile sits upon her face, and she gazes back up at you longingly. Her lips part, and she leans up t-\n",

The others might think there\u0027s nothing here, but you don\u0027t want to have to rely on their judgment. You push the memory away.\n\n\nHenrik leads the party at the front, and Borra follows right behind him. Seram is just a few paces behind them, so it ends up being you and Flavius who hold the back.\n\n\nYou turn to him now. Talking is the best way to pass time when traveling anyhow. \"Say, Flavius, why do you want to meet the muse so much anyway?\"\n\n\nThere is an audible groan from everyone else in the party, but Flavius ignores them.\n\n\n\"Why only because she\u0027s the most beautiful, most powerful, and the most knowledgeable person in all of the Lost Realm! The Muse of fire, my friend!\" A jovial laugh follows that. \n\n\nYou tilt your head at Flavius confused. \"But why do you want to meet her?\" \n\n\nHe takes a breath and starts again, \"Because she\u0027s the most beau-\"\n\n\n\"Let me rephrase. Why do you want to meet the most beautiful, most powerful, and the most knowledgeable person in all of the Lost Realm?\" This time when you ask him the question he hesitates. But only a second. After that he starts his rote response to that question. \n\n\nThis time, however, Seram is the one who interrupts him. He slows his horse until you catch up to where you\u0027re right beside him. \"You remember where he\u0027s from?\"\n\n\nYou nod at Seram, and Flavius watches the two of you with sad eyes. \"The Realm of Magic,\" Seram starts, \"is a place full of strife. War is ripe in that land, for that realm has no king. Every mage there constantly grasps for power in hopes of becoming the next mage king. Our friend here,\" Seram nods at Flavius, \"was no different. However, as is what happens when you have many people competing for a single goal, mages starting offing each other. Flavius managed to get away, but not without his power being stripped from him. Well, most of it anyway.\" \n\n\nThere\u0027s a moment of silence as you think this over, but Henrik soon disrupts that. \"Seram, you forgot to mention that the person who took his power was a boy. Not even an experienced man, but a green boy beat Flavius.\" \n\n\nYou watch Flavius as he reacts to Henrik\u0027s claim, and it contorts through several different emotions: Sadness, regret, but the most prominent among them is anger. It is through this emotion that he responds, \"The boy had the help of a muse. How was I supposed to win?\" \n\n\n\"Muses don\u0027t exist Flavius,\" is Henrik\u0027s rote reply. \n\n\n\"Yes they do! And I\u0027ll prove it to you soon. Just you wait. I will do this, and then none of you will be able to doubt me any-\" \n\n\nHis voice is cut off as you hear the twang of a bowstring fill the air. An arrow, of kobold make, sprouts from his chest. Blood flows from his wound, and after just a few seconds his eyes go blank and his body falls from the saddle. \n\n\n\"They\u0027re behind us!\" Seram shouts, so Henrik and Borra quickly wheel their horses around and ride toward you. You wheel your horse around to face the direction that the arrow comes from, but a glimmer of red catches your eye. The ruby must\u0027ve fallen out of Flavius\u0027 robes for it lies on the ground now. The potential key to your finding of Liliana lies daintily on the forest floor, and you are very tempted to take it right there, but then you hear kobold shouting and you know the enemy is here. \n\n\nFive giant lizards, with three kobold atop each, rush you and your party from behind. They outnumber you nearly five to one including the lizards, and you feel a horrible sense of foreboding. Didn\u0027t they all say the kobold wouldn\u0027t follow you here? Because of their mistake, you will be killed by a pack of reptilian beasts. \n\n\nOr will you? You glance back toward the ruby on the ground. If you were cutting your losses here, then it was the rest of the adventuring party that you could do without. Without the gem you didn\u0027t stand a chance of finding Liliana, and if you died here, then you definitely wouldn\u0027t be able to find her.

Let\u0027s do this.\" \n\n\nFor the first time that night, Henrik smiles. \"Borra, dagger.\" Henrik stands and walks around the table until he\u0027s standing beside you. There Borra hands him the very same dagger that was pressed to your throat moments before. \n\n\nAfter this, Henrik sits on the edge of the table, and looks at you with delighted eyes. You find this slightly disturbing, and even more disturbing when he says, \"Give me your hand.\" \n\n\nYet, you comply. You offer him your left hand, but he doesn\u0027t take it. \n\n\n\"Is this your dominant hand?\" \n\n\nYou shake your head. \"No.\" \n\n\n\"Then give me the other one. And hurry up with it. I don\u0027t have all night to be cutting fingers off.\"\n\n\nYou were in the middle of handing him your hand when he said that, so now you hesitate. Was he really about to cut one of your fingers off? That doesn\u0027t seem appealing to you in the slightest, and you begin to have second thoughts.\n",

On the morrow, you will begin your journey, but tonight you prepare. You stop at a watchtower on the way back. \n\n\nThey keep food and water storage in the towers, and if you were to have any hope of deserting and living then you would need supplies. You move quickly, and gather anything that you think might be useful: Food, water, flint and steel, extra arrows, a shield. Everything you could possibly need. After gathering it all, you put it in a pack and place it at the bottom of the tower. From there you head back to your barracks to get one last night of (attempted) rest. \n\n\n~~~\n\n\nMorning comes all too quickly, and you find yourself back at the bottom of the tower in no time. You grab your pack, take your last look around the tower, then face your exit.\n\n\nA large iron gate-like door greets you. It is quite the durable piece, and nothing less than a battering ram would be able to break through it. After you walk through these doors you will be considered a deserter, and there will be no turning back. With your thoughts centered on Liliana, you walk through the iron doors. \n\n\nA slight breeze pushes against your face.The green of the forest greets your eyes, and you can\u0027t help but feel a tinge of sadness at leaving your homeland. You start walking to the edge of the forest, and the active guards call out for you to stop, but you ignore them. They won\u0027t follow you into the forest, and you aren\u0027t going to stay. Your only option is to move forward in your search for Liliana. \n\n\nYou take a deep breath and take one last look at the wall.\n",
  "page 81": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe first few days turn out fine, but as you go farther, you get more and more unsure of where you\u0027re going.

Henrik then grabs your right hand and immediately places the dagger against your thumb. He starts to press the blade into your finger, and that\u0027s when you panic.\n\n\nYou yank your hand from his grasp, further cutting your thumb in the process, then attempt to stand up. Borra places her hands on your shoulders to stop you, but you aren\u0027t as inexperienced as they make you out to be. You pull Borra\u0027s right arm forward and yank it as hard as you can. Borra comes flying over your shoulder and onto the table. \n\n\nSeram and Flavius spring out of their chairs, but they don\u0027t reach you as fast as Henrik does. He lunges toward you with the dagger in hand, and at that moment he looks like he\u0027s out to stab you. your reflexes kick in, and you pull out your own dagger and thrust it into Henrik\u0027s chest as he reaches you. \n\n\nIt is only then that you realize that his arms were outstretched. As if he were going to tackle you not stab you.\n\n\nBy the time you realize this, however, it\u0027s already too late. Flavius is already swinging at your head with his mace. In a fit of guilt and regret, you don\u0027t even try to dodge. The mace connects with your head, and your brains splatter against the wall.\n",

Every instinct in your body tells you to yank your hand away from him, but you resist the temptation. \n\n\nThe blade digs even deeper, and it\u0027s not even a fourth of the way in there, but it hurts like hell.

It\u0027s all you can do to not to scream in pain and horror, but you still press on. Slowly, the blade digs deeper and deeper. \n\n\nIt\u0027s halfway now, and you start to feel light-headed.

You can\u0027t tell for sure.\n\n\nThe blade leaves your thumb, and Henrik drops your hand on the table. You do yelp at that, and you\u0027re beginning to think Henrik is a bit of a sadist. \n\n\nYou look up from your slashed thumb to the people surrounding you. Each one has a grin etched onto their face, and you wonder if you just made the worst mistake of your life.\n\n\n\"Welcome,\" Henrik says, \"To the Bane of Draconia.\"\n",
  "page 86": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nFlavius, as it turns out, is from the Realm of Magic. Not only that, but he even specializes in healing magic. That\u0027s probably why they were even cutting off half of a finger as their trial anyway.  Flavius casts a spell of healing on your wound, and while it doesn\u0027t magically heal your thumb perfectly, it does accelerate the healing process. Henrik gives you some ale as a pain killer, and in just a few minutes you are sitting back in that same chair. \n\n\nThey then tell you that the Bane of Draconia is an organization made for adventurers traveling in the Lost Realm. Since people going to and from the Lost Realm are far and few between, this group was made to help plan and execute raids into kobold territory. This is great and all, but a different question leaves the edge of your tongue.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s so important about the gem?\" \n\n\nFlavius smiles one of his smiles, and pulls the gem back out of his pocket. \"You might recall me talking of Raynalixa.\" When you give him a confused look, he expounds. \"The Muse. Anyway, our goal last raid was to retrieve this gem from a particular nasty kobold nest. It was quite heavily guarded, but sweet Borra found a way in, extracted the stone, then met back up with us. The kobold noticed far quicker than we expected, and chased us all the way here.\"\n\n\nYou aren\u0027t sure how you feel about them causing the deaths of so many guards for this gem, but you are sure about how you feel about him avoiding the question. \n\n\n\"But the gem. Is it really valuable?\"\n\n\nFlavius laughs a hearty laugh. \"Valuable? Valuable doesn\u0027t do it justice my friend. You might also recall me saying that we wouldn\u0027t be able to get to Raynalixa even if we knew where she was-\" \n\n\n\"Actually, it was vice vers-\" Henrik begins.\n\n\nBut Flavius waves his hand dismissively, \"Semantics. This, right here, is the key to opening her castle. Now we need only find it.\" \n\n\n\"Which is the hardest part,\" Seram adds idly. \n\n\n\"I, for one, don\u0027t give a rat\u0027s ass about some muse. I just know that we have it from good sources that,\" Borra points to the gem while she speaks, \"whatever that unlocks will hold loads of treasure.\" A smile touches the corners of her lips as she says this.\n\n\n\"Whatever the reason, we leave in one week\u0027s time. By then we should have everything we need to survive out there.\" Henrik says.\n\n\n\"I thought there was nothing out there but death,\" you respond. \n\n\n\"There are some things, you\u0027ll find, that not even the threat death can keep you from seeking,\" Henrik finishes.\n\n\nYou nod as if you didn\u0027t already know that. As if you didn\u0027t already feel, even breathe that. Death will have many opportunities to take you, but you decided a long time ago that it wouldn\u0027t stop you from seeking your love.\n\n\nA few more idle things are discussed, but the conversation pretty much ends there. Following your meeting, you head back upstairs to get some sleep. You have a big week ahead of you. \n\n\n~~~\n\n\nDespite what you think, the week isn\u0027t all that eventful, and mostly just consists of you gathering supplies. The only thing that takes the slightest amount of real time is you resigning from the wall guard. They\u0027re hesitant to let you do so, but a retinue of new guards come in to fill the gap, so they let you resign without too much trouble. \n\n\nYes, soon enough the week passes, and you and the rest of the group are outside the wall. \n\n\nThere\u0027s evidence of the battle a week ago, but nothing more than broken weapons lie around. \n\n\nYou, Henrik and the others mount up outside the wall, and prepare to leave. You carry the bare necessities on you, your sword and shield, and a bow with a quiver full of arrows. It isn\u0027t much, but it\u0027ll be enough to get you through the forest. \n\n\nHopefully.\n\n\nWith hopes for the future in mind, you and the others enter into the Lost Realm.\n",

After all the time you spent wondering where Arboribus could possibly be, finding out that it was just south quite frankly appalled you. You didn\u0027t think it would be so easy. Hell, you probably could have found this place on your own if you wandered in the right direction. \n\n\nWell, you assume you\u0027ll find it south based on the information you have. If it turns out to be wrong, then you\u0027ll  be really upset. \n\n\nFortunately for you, however, four days after you start heading south, and in the middle of the day, you see it.\n\n\nDespite having a wealth of wood ready for use, the city of Arboribus is a city of stone. Low rising walls mark the borders of the city, but the city is so large that you can\u0027t even see the other side of it from where you look. Guards walk the walls without vigilance, Their eyes wander everywhere but where they should be. They\u0027ve grown accustomed to never being attacked, and so only have guards, you guess, as a policing force. \n\n\nYou can\u0027t see much beyond the walls aside from barely peaking roofs of stone structures. Well, those, and the massive tree in the center of the city. It rises well above any wall, and above any castle you\u0027ve seen back in your realm. Stone staircases weave their way in and around the tree, but those aren\u0027t the most notable things about it. It\u0027s the massive hole in the Center of the tree that takes the cake there. Even from where you stand, you can see that the tree was hollowed out, and, guessing from the location of the tree, you can only assume that\u0027s where the acting ruler lives.\n\n\nYour heart pounds in your chest as you take in the magnificent city. Anticipation shakes you to your core, as well as relief that you\u0027ve finally found the city. Deeper than these, however, is the feeling of fear: fear of the unknown, fear for Liliana, fear that she won\u0027t want to come back with you, and, muse forbid, fear that Liliana isn\u0027t even alive. \n\n\nThe last time you felt such emotion was a long time ago in a memory you often choose to forget...\n",
  "page 5": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou pull yourself from the memory. That was happening way too often since Liliana was captured. And she was captured. There was no doubt in your mind about that. Captured by people who obviously knew what they were doing. Otherwise they wouldn\u0027t be able to make it through the forests of the Lost Realm without being captured, killed, or raped by horny kobold. That means there\u0027s a way to make it through that forest. You just have to find it. \n\n\nThat was the reason you spent your time here on the wall watching, waiting, planning your route through that kobold infested place. Of course you could just leave on your own and hope for the best, but th- \n\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted when the roar of some beast sounds throughout the air. You jerk your head immediately towards the sound. It came from somewhere over the tops of the trees, and still must\u0027ve been miles out. Every guard on the wall peels their eyes to the forest, and it isn\u0027t long before one of your fellow guardsmen spots something. \n\n\n\"There! Above the forest!\" The guard sounds quite panicked.\n\n\nYou look where he indicated and spot several grey blots in the distance. They look like birds at first, but as they get closer you can tell they\u0027re much larger and have several more rows of teeth than a bird. \n\n\n\"Wyverns.\" The guard right beside you breathes out. \n\n\nYou turn back to look at the beasts. They\u0027re still a few miles out, but you can hear the beat of their leathery wings drawing closer every second. The guards in your platoon stand on the wall in stunned silence. Nothing happens here, ever. Why now of all times? \n\n\nYour lieutenant, an older fellow named Byron, calls everyone to order. \"This is what we\u0027re here for men! This is why...\" \n\n\nByron\u0027s voice fades into the depths of your mind. It is replaced by a different voice. One that\u0027s mocking, provoking. The memory of your first fight calls back to you.\n",

Gather your weap-\" Byron is interrupted by another voice. \n\n\n\"Help! There are kobold chasing us on the ground. The rest of my party is coming with the kobold hot on their tail.\" The voice comes from all the way at the bottom of the wall. You can barely make out what he\u0027s saying, but someone does and repeats it to Byron, who then continues speaking.\n\n\n\"I need one person to light the signal light over by the watchtower. Everyone in division two stay here and support us with arrows. Everyone in division one follow me!\" \n\n\nByron leads the way as he and division one head down to the ground to support the rest of the group. Everyone else stays and prepares their bows. \n\n\nYou were assigned to division two upon your transfer here, and so your orders are abundantly clear. \n",

Grass presses against your face, and you even feel some dirt in your mouth. That was fine. You didn\u0027t care very much. These guys could push you around all they wanted. They\u0027d never be able to beat you as bad as your father did. \n\n\n\"Stop it, Daniel!\" Liliana\u0027s voice sounds from behind you. Apparently she didn\u0027t like Daniel pushing you. \n\n\nYou slowly pick yourself up and off of the ground as Daniel replies. \"What? You didn\u0027t like me pushing your bitch around?\" That remark is followed by some laughter. \n\n\n\"He hasn\u0027t done anything to you.\" Liliana replies readily. \"Leave and go hit your mom if you\u0027re looking for a bitch to hit. Don\u0027t touch him.\" There\u0027s a moment of silence before you hear a smack. That sound reverberates around the academy yard, and for a moment you think Liliana finally slapped the guy like she said she\u0027d been wanting to do, but when you turn around you find it\u0027s the complete opposite. Liliana is on the grass now, clutching her face. You see tears start to come to her eyes, but she doesn\u0027t sob. Not anymore.\n\n\nYou\u0027ve never been the most violent person. Your mother instilled that into you, so you let others push you around. You didn\u0027t give a damn either way, but when you see Liliana on the ground you don\u0027t hesitate. \n\n\nYou lunge forward and shove Daniel hard in the chest, and you do it hard enough to send him flying to the ground as well, but unlike you and Liliana he gets back up to his feet quickly. His reaction is also quick. He immediately rushes toward you and raises his fist back. You can tell a punch is coming.\n\n\nYou\u0027ve grown in the past couple years, and are easily one of the tallest guys in class. Aside from Daniel, that is. You might not be taller than Daniel, but you\u0027d bet your mother\u0027s corpse (Muse bless her soul) that you can take more hits than he can.

  "page 2": "Year 366 of the Second Era\n\n\n...charismatic of people, but you were smart enough to know that, when crying, a girl needs a comforting shoulder. Not a questioning voice. \n\n\nYou follow the sound of sobbing through the worn wooden hallways of the school, and outside, until you find the source of the crying. Liliana sits on the steps to the main door of the school. Her well crafted dress is ruffled in places and her body constantly shifts under the pressure of her tears. Her hair comes down in waves around her head, effectively cutting off any view of her face. \n\n\nShe doesn\u0027t notice you there at first, but when the main door closes behind you she jumps and turns towards you. Tears and snot cover her face with her eyes both sad and angry at the same time, and for a moment you find yourself regretting coming here. That moment passes, and the impulse you followed earlier propels you toward her. \n\n\n\"Are you going to laugh at me again?\"\n\n\nHer voice reflects what she is feeling. Sadness, despair, anger, and, you think, a bit of hope color her voice. You decide to concentrate on her hopefulness. \n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t laugh.\" \n\n\n\"Everyone laughed. I saw.\" \n\n\nClearly she hadn\u0027t been paying attention to you when in the classroom. \"Not me.\" \n\n\nYou sit down on the same step as her, and she glares at you. Silence ensues, and you turn away and gaze out in front of you. You want to ask her about the Realm of the Lost, but the question dies in your throat. Wouldn\u0027t it be at least a little insensitive to ask her prying questions now? \n\n\nYour question is answered when you hear her start to sob again. This time it\u0027s less intense, but it\u0027s still crying all the same. Maybe it\u0027s the memory of her excited face when she was in front of the classroom, or maybe you just didn\u0027t like the sound of crying. Whatever the reason, you decide to wrap your arm around her shoulders in a half hug. Liliana turns to stone beneath your touch, and you think she\u0027ll pull away, but she doesn\u0027t. She stays still, but continues her crying. You feel absurdly awkward in this position, but she doesn\u0027t seem to mind. She even leans into your hug after a while.\n\n\nIn between holding her and listening to her crying, you find yourself staring at her wondering how in all the realms this girl was from the Lost Realm. You might be tainted by the knowledge of fairytales, but you were still aware that the Lost Realm was crawling with kobold and others of that ilk. It was a very dangerous place. At the end of the first era was when the Lost Realm was supposedly at the height of its power, but that ended when a dragon led a massive host of kobold and wyverns and sacked the entirety of the realm. Well, that\u0027s how the stories went. So how then, could a delicate being such as this come from such a dangerous place?\n\n\nThen a brilliant idea came over you. There was a story your mother once told you. One about the faerie, a race of beings native to the Lost Realm. When they were in the Lost Realm they were humanoid creatures of a similar height humans, but with pointed ears and a slender build. In the story, a faerie wandered over the border of the Realm of Men and the Realm of the Lost,  (Before the border walls were constructed) but the faerie were tied to their own realm. Whenever they left, they became as humans. This particular faerie panicked when they realized they left their home for another realm, and immediately tried to go back, but every time he tried to re-enter his homeland, he would get lost, turned around. He could never find his way back. Once the faerie willingly left the Realm of the Lost, they weren\u0027t allowed back. He was left in the Realm of Men to fend for himself, but he desired that no their faerie would feel like he did. Alone, confused and afraid. So the faerie came up with a code. If he thought there was another faerie, he would ask them a simple question. \n\n\nYou ask that question now. \"Are you lost?\"\n\n\nLiliana immediately pulls from you and stares at you in disbelief. She suddenly wipes all of the tears from her face with her sleeve before asking you a question. \"Will you help me fit in here?\" \n\n\nKinda shocked that your plan worked you only nod in response. \n\n\nA hint of a smile breaches her face. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \n\n\nYou briefly wonder what you\u0027ve gotten yourself into, but you answer regardless. \"My name is...\"\n",
  "page 149": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nAs much as you might enjoy reminiscing, you have an obligation to be paying attention to the task at hand. Even if it is just you soaring through the air. \n\n\nYou look below in an attempt to see the forest, but as you do so, you lean too far and the sickening feeling of falling enters your body. Fortunately for you, the saddle was made well, so you don\u0027t fall several hundred feet to your death. Emelyne must have felt the sudden shift in the saddle, for she shifts her body to look at you. \n\n\n\"Everything alright?\" She doesn\u0027t say master anymore. A development that you are certainly grateful for. \n\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah, I\u0027m fine.\" \n\n\nShe looks at you for a moment longer reaching an arm behind her and grabbing your arm. She then pulls your arm toward her and places it at her waist. She does the same with your other arm. \"It\u0027s easier for you to stay on this way,\" she calls back to you.\n\n\nYou don\u0027t say a word, and instead try to avoid thinking about the gentle curves of her waist, and the swell of her bodice the farther down you look. Thank the muses she can\u0027t see where I\u0027m looking, you think gratefully. Otherwise, she\u0027d peg me for a lecher and a cheat. \n\n\nTime passes, and your earlier wariness is soon forgotten in your need for comfort. You slide forward and lean your body against hers for stability. She doesn\u0027t comment on this. She is probably more surprised you didn\u0027t do it from the start than anything else. Hours pass like this, and several times, when Emelyne grows tired, you find her leaning back into you. For support. For solidarity. \n\n\nSoon enough night time comes, and Emelyne has Adroxius descend to the ground. Through a hole in the forest\u0027s canopy and onto a clear patch of ground just large enough for you, Emelyne, and Adroxius to sleep. That night you feast on cold bread, cheese, and smoked meat. \n\n\nMorning comes quickly, and soon enough you are back in the air. The same position, the same route. everything the same. Even the trees. You head south in general, but you have no real idea where Arboribus is, so once you have traveled far enough you\u0027ll have to start searching for a city instead of just flying aimlessly. That\u0027s when it\u0027ll get dangerous, but for now, you revel in the peace you have, for you know it won\u0027t last.\n",

No drops of blood from clumsy mothers who pricked themselves on their needle. No lazy patches sewn in to cover up holes. No, her dress was flawless. Her hair was onyx black, and fell down in waves around her face. Her glittering blue eyes were filled with anticipation, and maybe a little fear. She clearly wasn\u0027t used to being in these kinds of situations, and she kept glancing around as if someone else was going to introduce her to the other classmates. \n\n\nYour teacher, a hag of a woman, prompted her to introduce herself. \"Go ahead and introduce yourself to the class, dear.\"\n\n\nShe widened her eyes in surprise, but followed the teacher\u0027s command. \"My name is Liliana, I\u0027m ten years of age, and..,\" she looked to the teacher for instruction. She had an accent, and one that you\u0027d never heard before at that. Not northern, or even like those from the eastern realm. No, this was decidedly different from any other accent you\u0027d heard before.\n\n\n\"Go on,\" the teacher prompted again.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t know what else to say,\" Liliana responded.\n\n\nThe teacher frowned disappointedly. \"Surely you have more things to tell us about yourself than your name?\" When Liliana didn\u0027t respond, the teacher spoke again. \"Where are you from? Or, what do you like to do in your spare time? Tell us things like that.\" \n\n\nLiliana hesitated once more.\n\n\n\"Come now. We don\u0027t judge people here,\" the hag patted her comfortingly on the shoulder, but failed to notice the snickering in the back. \n\n\nLiliana, it seemed, found her words comforting, and finally started to open up. \"I was born in Arboribus. My father is the king there, and it\u0027s an amazing place. There are trees larger than castles there! Oh, and I like to go stag riding with my father if he has the ti-\" \n\n\nThe teacher interrupted. \"Excuse me. Where?\" The teacher sounded somewhat confused, but definitely disappointed. The snickering in the back increased, but Liliana still hadn\u0027t noticed. \n\n\n\"Arboribus,\" she said this clearly, and with an expression of incredulity fixed upon her face. The teacher simply stared at her blankly, until Liliana continued. \"You know, in The Lost Realm...\"  \n\n\nThe boys in the back, try as they might, couldn\u0027t contain themselves any longer. They busted out into raucous laughter that spread to the rest of the students that were typically thought of as nice. Everyone gave into the laughter, and even the teacher hag was chuckling.\n\n\nYou were on the edge of laughter as well, but something kept you there. Stories of The Lost Realm, and rumors of a ancient city of humans therein. Your mother, before she died of disease, would tell you fairy tales of the ancient land, and how it used to be as prosperous as the Realm of Men is now. You\u0027d always harbored the secret thought, hope, that the stories were true, and here was a person who claimed to hail from that very place. This, and the expression on Liliana\u0027s face, caused you to hesitate.  Her expression was that of someone hurt , and a genuine expression at that. \n\n\nYou held the laughter off, and waited for everyone else to do the same. They eventually quieted down, but only after tears started streaming down Liliana\u0027s face. Silence took the place of laughter, and all joy was replaced with the sad sound of sobbing. \n\n\nThe old hag had the decency to attempt to comfort her by giving her a hug, but Liliana jerked away. Apparently she didn\u0027t like the idea of hugging the old hag. Especially since she\u0027d promised no ridicule would come, but then turned around and gloried in it herself. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s true!\" Liliana yelled after she managed to control her sobbing. \"I\u0027m not a liar! And, and ,and...\" She starts crying again, but instead of staying in the classroom for everyone to see, she ran through the door and out of the classroom. \n\n\nThe silence continued for a moment longer, before you made your first life changing decision. You got up from your designated chair and followed after Liliana. \n\n\nYou were no expert at dealing with girls. Let alone crying ones, and you weren\u0027t the most...\n",
  "page 148": "Year 372 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe stench of alcohol permeates throughout the house. All throughout it are empty kegs, scattered furniture, and soiled clothes. It\u0027s a mess to say the least, Not that you would say anything, for your father would beat you if you did. Even at the age of sixteen, your father claimed the right to beat you senseless whenever he saw fit. He beat you when it was dirty, when it was clean, even when he was sober. You supposed it was a kind of addiction for your father as if he gained some sick sort of joy from beating someone younger than him. \n\n\nLiliana got pissed whenever she saw a new bruise on you. She insisted several times that she would go to your house and beat him herself if you didn\u0027t do something about it. You didn\u0027t, and she tried, she really did, but you would never let her leave. You\u0027d hug her until she relented, then hold her as if you were comforting her. In reality, you  were comforting yourself. \n\n\nYour father and you have a unique relationship. Ever since your mother died, your father entered a state of constant abusiveness, and, out of respect for your mother, you never retaliated. You still never retaliate, for deep down, you still believe he loves you. Even if it\u0027s in a deep and twisted way. You\u0027d hoped that today of all days, he would show that love, but he doesn\u0027t. He just lays on his bed in a drunken stupor refusing to do anything productive. He works in a local bar at night, so he at least has some excuse. That excuse doesn\u0027t really explain how he never cleans his house though, and why he insists upon leaving empty kegs everywhere. \n\n\nYou set to cleaning the house up. Today is a special day, and you donn\u0027t want it to be dirty for your guest. It\u0027s a fairly long process. Your father isn\u0027t good at many things, but he sure knows how to dirty up a house. The process is tedious, and a few minutes in you find your thoughts wandering. They go first to your plan for getting your father out of the house early, then to Liliana, then to your school work, and back to Liliana. Your thoughts always ended up back there. You never thought you could be as close to someone as you are to her, especially when at first they seemed to be kinda weird. \n\n\nShe used to always talk about her supposed home in the Lost Realm, and you indulged her conversations each time, but as you grew older you found yourself starting to doubt her claims. You\u0027d grown out of the fairytales your mother taught you. Liliana noticed this and stopped going on about her home. It was then that she began to entrench herself in your life. She couldn\u0027t go back to her home, wherever that was, so she formed her new home around you. The first few years were great, but then puberty happened and it became awkward. Fast forward to now and it was both great and awkward. The same friendship, but with more romantic tension than you\u0027d thought possible. You keep on hoping that she\u0027ll like you in the same way you like her, but she never gives any signs of it. Thus, you wait. Maybe one day...\n\n\nYou push the thoughts of Liliana from your head as you finish cleaning the house. The kegs are lined up against the wall, the floors are clear, and even the smell isn\u0027t as atrocious as it was an hour ago. Now the hard part. \n\n\nYou walk to your father\u0027s room and open the door. The stench in there is significantly stronger than in the rest of the house, and the room is dirtier as well. A keg, with a mug atop it, sits right beside the bed in the center of the room. Your father, a man your height with a beer belly and graying hair, lays on the bed. He snores loudly, so it\u0027s easy to sneak across the room and open the window. Outside, the sun is going down. That means it\u0027s time for your father to go to work.\n\n\nYou sigh and begin the process by taking his empty mug and refilling it with ale from the barrel. From there you give him a light shake, and when that doesn\u0027t work, a heavy one. He rouses from this one.\n\n\n\"Dammit kid what do you want?\" He lazily slaps at your face, but he\u0027s not quite sober, so his hand misses.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s time for you to go to work, sir.\" He smacks you when you don\u0027t call him sir. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll go to work whenever the hell I want. Gimme that.\" He snatches the mug from your hand and takes a large swig.\n\n\nAnd then another swig, and another until the entire mug is drained. He then throws it at your face. \"Refill it.\" \n\n\nYou comply. \"Father, I have a gift for you.\" \n\n\nHe takes the full mug from you and looks at you like you\u0027re crazy. \"What?\" \n\n\nHe isn\u0027t the brightest of people, so you figure you better show him instead. You pull a sack of coins out of your trouser pocket and toss it to him. \"I saved up some money for you. I know how hard it is for you to work your job and I figured you could use some help,\" you lie to him. You just know that if he has money to spend then he\u0027ll leave to go to work earlier, and return home even later. \n\n\nHe grunts and gestures for you to leave. \n\n\nNext part of the plan is a success, and you didn\u0027t even get hit while doing it. Discounting the thrown mug of course. Now you just have to wait until he leaves. \n\n\nWhich, as it turns out, happens like you thought it would. He leaves much earlier than he usually does, and he doesn\u0027t even comment on the state of the house. Everything is going according to plan, so now all you have to do is wait.\n\n\nTen minutes go by, and then another, and before you know it, an hour has gone by. Yet, your guest hasn\u0027t shown up. You start pacing back and forth in front of the door, and eventually you hear rapping on your door. You immediately throw the door open, and there she is.\n\n\nHer onyx black hair cascades in black waves around her face which only serves to bring out the vibrant color of her stormy blue eyes. She wears an elegant dark black dress that stretches just past her knees. You look her over mentally checking to see if she\u0027d been in harmed since you last saw her. She hasn\u0027t, and you look back up to her face. A teasing smile stretches across her face, and you return it with a smile of your own. Liliana. \n\n\n\"Were you waiting at the door for me?\" She steps forward and wraps her arms around you in a close hug.\n\n\n\"Of course not,\" you reply. She doesn\u0027t seem convinced, however, so you continue, \"I just happened to be walking by.\" \n\n\nShe shakes her head lightly, stands on her tip toes, then whispers lightly in your ear, \"Happy birthday.\" \n\n\nShe then releases you from her hug and walks past you into the house. You\u0027re left with your heart pounding in your chest, and your cheeks flushed red. \n\n\n\"You already told me that today,\" you say as you follow her in. \n\n\n\"Saying it again won\u0027t hurt you. Besides this day only comes once a year. I should be saying it more often.\" She stands just inside the door and stares around. The house is clean for the most part, but an occasional stain from spilled ale mars the floors. \n\n\nShe walks slowly forward seemingly taking every detail in. She was the one who insisted upon coming to your house. \u0027You know about my home,\u0027 she\u0027d said \u0027so I should know about yours.\u0027\n\n\nThat was two years ago, and only now you finally gave in. \n\n\n\"This is nice,\" Liliana comments. \n\n\nYou scoff. \"You should\u0027ve seen it a couple of hours ago. This place was a dump, and will be again when my dad gets back.\" \n\n\nShe doesn\u0027t respond, and instead slowly makes her way through the house. It isn\u0027t the largest house, but her tour takes much longer than you think is necessary.\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s your room?\" She asks.\n\n\nYou point, \"Down that hallway.\" \n\n\nShe follows your instructions, and heads down the hallway, but when she gets to your door, she turns to the right and opens your father\u0027s door instead. \n\n\n\"No not that-\" you start, but by the time you say it, she\u0027s already walked into the room. \n\n\nShe, almost immediately, yells for you. \"What is that!\" It\u0027s a yell of horror and shock. \n\n\nYou didn\u0027t want her to see how disgusting your father is, and you feel a dreadful sense of embarrassment as you approach her. She stands just inside the doorway and stares at the ground in horror. Soiled clothes, spilled ale, and trash cover it. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry. I told you my father was a pig. I didn\u0027t want you to see this disgusting part of m-\"\n\n\nShe turns to you and interrupts. \"I don\u0027t care about the mess! I don\u0027t give a damn if your father is the most disgusting person in the realm.\" Tears start to form in her eyes. \"Just tell me that isn\u0027t what I think it is.\"\n\n\nShe points to the floor. You don\u0027t see what she\u0027s pointing at at first, but as you examine it further, you see a stain on the floorboards. Clothes cover the majority of it, but Liliana sets to work and starts moving the clothes out of the way. You don\u0027t stop her as she does so.\n\n\nShe spends a few minutes clearing the floor until a sizable portion is visible. She then turns back towards you with tears daring to fall out of her eyes. \"What is that?\"\n\n\nYou already know what the stain is, but you look over it anyway. It\u0027s large with seemingly no pattern to it, though it is largely circular in nature. It\u0027s a dark splotch, and if you weren\u0027t looking closely then you wouldn\u0027t be able to see the hint of red there. Blood, you think but don\u0027t say it. You don\u0027t need to confirm her suspicions.\n\n\nBut she knows you better than that. Refusal to answer is equivalent to answering in this case, so the tears in her eyes start falling. \"Why do you let him do this to you? He shouldn\u0027t be hurting you! You\u0027re his child!\" She practically screams this at you, but you aren\u0027t the one she\u0027s angry at. You don\u0027t blame her. If your mother saw this, then she would likely be screaming as well.\n\n\nYou\u0027d never felt inclined to answer her question before, but you do now. It comes out as a whisper, \"He\u0027s all I have left, Lily. He\u0027s my only family.\" You feel your eyes start to burn as well, but you hold back the tears. You don\u0027t want her to see you crying.\n\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t mean you let him beat you to death!\" She slaps you lightly on your arm. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t say anything, so she continues. \"I\u0027m here for you. I care for you. I ... I,\" She struggles to get this last part out. \"Dammit, I love you!\" \n\n\nHer proclamation resounds throughout the room, and your heart stutters. Her tear stained azure eyes stare into your own, and the room goes silent. The silence lasts only a second before you surge forward and pull her into a tight embrace. \"I love you too,\" You whisper to her. \"I love you too.\"\n\n\nYou pull back and look into her eyes. the evidence of tears is clear, but no longer is her expression sad. A smile sits upon her face, and she gazes back up at you longingly. Her lips part, and she leans up toward you. It\u0027s plain, even for someone as inexperienced as you, what she wants. \n\n\nYou happily oblige. Her lips are soft, and kind of wet from the tears, but it doesn\u0027t detract from the experience. Your lips mesh against hers softly, but as you both grow more sure of yourselves, the kisses become more heated. Before long, you kiss her hungrily, and she replies in kind. You get into it, and before long another feeling enters the fray of emotion. You are acutely aware of every curve of her body as she presses against you. You can barely help yourself when your hands start wandering, but she doesn\u0027t stop you. This encourages you, and before long the two of you begin taking each others clothes off.\n\n\nTaken over by fevered passion, you pick her up and carry her to your room where you engage in...activities you never had before. Neither her nor you know exactly what you\u0027re doing, but together you figure it out, and you spend that night with her in bliss.\n",
  "page 4": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou pull yourself from the memory. That was happening way too often since Liliana was captured. And she was captured. There was no doubt in your mind about that. Captured by people who obviously knew what they were doing. Otherwise they wouldn\u0027t be able to make it through the forests of the Lost Realm without being captured, killed, or raped by horny kobold. That means there\u0027s a way to make it through that forest. You just have to find it. \n\n\nThat was the reason you spent your time here on the wall watching, waiting, planning your route through that kobold infested place. Of course you could just leave on your own and hope for the best, but th- \n\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted when the roar of some beast sounds throughout the air. You jerk your head immediately towards the sound. It came from somewhere over the tops of the trees, and still must\u0027ve been miles out. Every guard on the wall peels their eyes to the forest, and it isn\u0027t long before one of your fellow guardsmen spots something. \n\n\n\"There! Above the forest!\" The guard sounds quite panicked.\n\n\nYou look where he indicated and spot several grey blots in the distance. They look like birds at first, but as they get closer you can tell they\u0027re much larger and have several more rows of teeth than a bird. \n\n\n\"Wyverns.\" The guard right beside you breathes out. \n\n\nYou turn back to look at the beasts. They\u0027re still a few miles out, but you can hear the beat of their leathery wings drawing closer every second. The guards in your platoon stand on the wall in stunned silence. Nothing happens here, ever. Why now of all times? \n\n\nYour lieutenant, an older fellow named Byron, calls everyone to order. \"This is what we\u0027re here for men! This is why...\" \n\n\nByron\u0027s voice fades into the depths of your mind. It is replaced by a different voice. One that\u0027s mocking, provoking. The memory of your first fight calls back to you.\n",
  "page 3": "Year 366 of the Second Era\n\n\n...intelligent of people, but you were outgoing enough to provide a suitable person for her to talk to.\n\n\nYou follow the sound of sobbing through the worn wooden hallways of the school, and outside, until you find the source of the crying. Liliana sits on the steps to the main door of the school. Her well crafted dress is ruffled in places and her body constantly shifts under the pressure of her tears. Her hair comes down in waves around her head, effectively cutting off any view of her face. \n\n\nShe doesn\u0027t notice you there at first, but when the main door closes behind you she jumps and turns towards you. Tears and snot cover her face with her eyes both sad and angry at the same time, and for a moment you find yourself regretting coming here. That moment passes, and the impulse you followed earlier propels you toward her. \n\n\n\"Are you going to laugh at me again?\"\n\n\nHer voice reflects what she is feeling. Sadness, despair, anger, and, you think, a bit of hope color her voice. You decide to concentrate on her hopefulness. \n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t laugh.\" \n\n\n\"Everyone laughed. I saw.\" \n\n\nClearly she hadn\u0027t been paying attention to you when in the classroom. \"Not me.\" \n\n\nYou sit down on the same step as her, and she glares at you. Silence ensues, and you turn away and gaze out in front of you. You want to ask her about the Realm of the Lost, but the question dies in your throat. Wouldn\u0027t it be at least a little insensitive to ask her prying questions now? \n\n\nYour question is answered when you hear her start to sob again. This time it\u0027s less intense, but it\u0027s still crying all the same. Maybe it\u0027s the memory of her excited face when she was in front of the classroom, or maybe you just didn\u0027t like the sound of crying. Whatever the reason, you decide to wrap your arm around her shoulders in a half hug. Liliana turns to stone beneath your touch, and you think she\u0027ll pull away, but she doesn\u0027t. She stays still, but continues her crying. You feel absurdly awkward in this position, but she doesn\u0027t seem to mind. She even leans into your hug after a while.\n\n\nIn between holding her and listening to her crying, you find yourself staring at her wondering how in all the realms this girl was from the Lost Realm. You might be tainted by the knowledge of fairytales, but you were still aware that the Lost Realm was crawling with kobold and others of that ilk,. It was a very dangerous place. At the end of the first era was when the Lost Realm was supposedly at the height of its power, but that ended when a dragon led a massive host of kobold and wyverns and sacked the entirety of the realm. Well, that\u0027s how the stories went. So how then, could a delicate being such as this come from such a dangerous place?\n\n\nThen a brilliant idea came over you. There was a story your mother once told you. One about the faerie, a race of beings native to the Lost Realm. When they were in the Lost Realm they were humanoid creatures of a similar height humans, but with pointed ears and a slender build. In the story, a faerie wandered over the border of the Realm of Men and the Realm of the Lost,  (Before the border walls were constructed) but the faerie were tied to their own realm. Whenever they left, they became as humans. This particular faerie panicked when they realized they left their home for another realm, and immediately tried to go back, but every time he tried to re-enter his homeland, he would get lost, turned around. He could never find his way back. Once the faerie willingly left the Realm of the Lost, they weren\u0027t allowed back. He was left in the Realm of Men to fend for himself, but he desired that no their faerie would feel like he did. Alone, confused and afraid. So the faerie came up with a code. If he thought there was another faerie, he would ask them a simple question. \n\n\nYou ask that question now. \"Are you lost?\"\n\n\nLiliana immediately pulls from you and stares at you in disbelief. She suddenly wipes all of the tears from her face with her sleeve before asking you a question. \"Will you help me fit in here?\" \n\n\nKinda shocked that your plan worked you only nod in response. \n\n\nA hint of a smile breaches her face. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \n\n\nYou briefly wonder what you\u0027ve gotten yourself into, but you answer regardless. \"My name is...\"\n",
  "page 99": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThey\u0027ll be fine while you go help Seram. At least you hope so. Either way, a healthy combatant should be able to handle themselves better than a wounded one.nbsp;\n\n\nYou sprint to Seram, and charge directly into one of the kobold with your shield. That kobold is sent sprawling, and before it can realize what is happening, you finish it with a quick stab from your sword. the other two kobold were startled by your appearance, and Seram manages to kill one as well. The last kobold attempts to escape, but you are quicker. You slash its leg first, then, when it falls on its knees, you behead the miserable thing. \n\n\nIt is right about then, however, that you hear the scream. You turn toward the sound of the voice, and a gruesome sight greets your eyes. Henrik\u0027s and Borra\u0027s heads stand on crude spears. The kobold by their dead bodies number five. They stand around your allies dead bodies, and gaze hungrily in your direction. Milling about behind them is the last of the five giant lizards.\n\n\nThey don\u0027t charge you. They sit their and wait. Tactics are unheard of among the majority of kobold, but these are not the majority. Their plan is simple. Provoke their enemies by desecrating their corpses. You aren\u0027t fazed by any of it,but the gore. \n\n\nSeram, however, falls right into it. Upon seeing his friends heads on spears, he surges forward with his great sword dragging along the ground beside him. Despite his wound, he charges at breakneck speed. His eyes cry for vengeance, but his body screams for mercy. He cannot fight them all and win. \n\n\nYou start after him, but you aren\u0027t able to catch him before he reaches them. The kobold dodge nimbly out of the reach of his great sword, but never attack. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t until you remember the giant lizard, that you see why. They surround and distract him so he won\u0027t see the beast coming, and their plan works terrifyingly well. When Seram is turned away from the lizard, they make their move. The giant lizard surges forward and tackles Seram\u0027s already weak body to the ground. One of the kobold immediately stabs his throat. Seram\u0027s grip on his sword slackens, and you are left alone surrounded by the enemy. You immediately lunge forward and stab the lizard through its throat. If you were to have any chance of surviving this, then that needed to be killed first. \n\n\nYou then leap atop the lizard\u0027s dying corpse and examine the field around you. Five kobold still remain. All of which stare at you with bloodthirsty eyes. \n\n\nThey rush you. One strikes at your legs, and another stabs at you with his spear. You somehow manage to block each of these attacks, but you deal out none of your own. You can\u0027t win if you can\u0027t attack. Slowly you start to lose energy until the fateful strike pushes against your shield with too much strength, and you are sent tumbling from the high ground. \n\n\nYou life flashes before your eyes, and regrets and doubts fill your mind. Even Henrik couldn\u0027t get up after being knocked down, so how could you? Your back lies against the ground and you close your eyes. You have accepted your fate...\n",
  "page 98": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYour heart and soul clench with guilt as you turn from Seram and follow Henrik. You have to protect your chances of survival. Seram, as bad as it sounds, isn\u0027t worth as much as Henrik right now.\n\n\nYou run after Henrik, but before you catch up he charges directly into the band of kobold standing around Borra\u0027s...body? You didn\u0027t see her when you first started running, but now you see her clearly. Her body is motionless, deadly still whilst it lays upon the ground. You hope that, by some crazy miracle, she lives. Those hopes are dashed when one of the many kobold stabs its sword through her chest. \n\n\nHenrik screams at the top of the lungs when he sees this, and, enraged, he charges the kobold that killed Borra. With nothing left to do but help him, you follow. Henrik kills that kobold, and, back to back, you two face the rest of the band. \n\n\nOut of the corner of your eye you see Seram\u0027s head separate from his shoulders, and the three kobold he was facing head toward you. \n\n\nSorely outnumbered and demoralized, you and Henrik clash against the remaining kobold. The whole fight is a blur, and you react and act off of pure instinct. Two kobold go down by Henrik, and on goes down by you. Five left. Three surround Henrik, and he fends them off really well, but like you, he failes to remember that there is a giant lizard still roaming about. \n\n\nThat giant lizard charges Henrik and sends him crashing to the ground. You realize what\u0027s about to happen, so act blindingly fast. You kill the kobold between you and Henrik and rush toward him, but you are too late.\n\n\nOne of the kobold fighting him has already managed to stick its sword in his throat.

It has a hell of a lot of power. Certainly more than you anticipated, but you don\u0027t allow yourself to stumble. Your head snaps back as it hits, and there\u0027s a lot of pain, but you ignore it. Instead you revel in the shock displayed upon Daniel\u0027s face. He\u0027s thoroughly surprised, and you doubt someone has ever lasted past the first punch against him. Let alone be barely affected by it. \n\n\nYou look him dead in the eyes and smile just before returning his punch with one of your own. He doesn\u0027t get away in time, and is hammered by your punch. He stumbles backward, and you take a step forward and shove him to the ground once more. There\u0027s no time for him to react as you pounce on top of him and lay punch after punch into his face. His \u0027friends\u0027 don\u0027t rise to stop you, and the courtyard is silent save for the sound of your fist pounding his face. \n\n\nAfter several more punches you feel a hand on your shoulder. You nearly jerk away from it, but, despite your frenzied mind, you are able to recognize that it is a distinctly feminine hand. Liliana, you think and stop punching. Daniel doesn\u0027t stop his groaning as you rise to your feet to face her. \n\n\nThere\u0027s less baby fat on her face now than when you first saw her, and is beginning to be quite the knockout. Her eyes are still slightly red and the right side of her face is still red, but she isn\u0027t crying any more. \n\n\n\"Enough,\" she whispers to you. \n\n\nYou only nod in response. You start to walk away from the scene when you realize that you\u0027d gathered quite the crowd. You think about saying something, but instead you reach for Liliana\u0027s hand and glare at everyone in the crowd. Your look says it all. \n\n\nYou leave the scene with Liliana in tow.\n",

An arrow, of kobold make, sprouts from Flavius\u0027 chest. Blood flows from his wound, and after just a few seconds his eyes go blank and his body falls from the saddle. The attack is so sudden that you barely have any time to gather your senses before Seram spurs you into action.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re behind us!\" Seram shouts, so Henrik and Borra quickly wheel their horses around and ride toward you. You wheel your horse around to face the direction that the arrow comes from, but a glimmer of red catches your eye.

They outnumber you nearly five to one including the lizards, and you feel a horrible sense of foreboding. Didn\u0027t they all say the kobold wouldn\u0027t follow you here? Because of their mistake, you\u0027ll be killed by a pack of reptilian beasts. \n\n\nOr will you? You glance back toward the ruby on the ground. If you were cutting your losses here, then it was the rest of the adventuring party that you could do without. Without the gem you didn\u0027t stand a chance of finding Liliana, and if you died here, then you definitely wouldn\u0027t be able to find her. The ruby calls out to you, and you wonder if you shouldn\u0027t just leave these three, take the gem, and continue your journey by yourself. \n",

Likely one you\u0027re the most fond of, for it was the moment you and Liliana really and truly fell in love. \n\n\nYou sigh idly, then yawn. While reminiscing was fine, you think it\u0027s probably not for the best to dwell on the past for to long. Especially when you should be trying to remember the way you came. Sure the clouds covered the majority of your view of the realm, but if you could just lean a little bit you\u0027re sure you can get a good glimpse of the realm.\n\n\nYou look below in an attempt to see the forest, but as you do so, you lean too far and the sickening feeling of falling enters your body. Fortunately for you, the saddle was made well, so you don\u0027t fall several hundred feet to your death. Emelyne must have felt the sudden shift in the saddle, for she shifts her body to look at you. \n\n\n\"Everything alright?\" She doesn\u0027t say master anymore. A development that you are certainly grateful for. \n\n\nYou nod. \"Yeah, I\u0027m fine.\" \n\n\nShe looks at you for a moment longer reaching an arm behind her and grabbing your arm. She then pulls your arm toward her and places it at her waist. She does the same with your other arm. \"It\u0027s easier for you to stay on this way,\" she calls back to you.\n\n\nYou don\u0027t say a word, and instead try to avoid thinking about the gentle curves of her waist, and the swell of her bodice the farther down you look. Thank the muses she can\u0027t see where I\u0027m looking, you think gratefully. Otherwise, she\u0027d peg me for a lecher and a cheat. \n\n\nTime passes, and your earlier wariness is soon forgotten in your need for comfort. You slide forward and lean your body against hers for stability. She doesn\u0027t comment on this. She is probably more surprised you didn\u0027t do it from the start than anything else. Hours pass like this, and several times, when Emelyne grows tired, you find her leaning back into you. For support. For solidarity. \n\n\nSoon enough night time comes, and Emelyne has Adroxius descend to the ground. Through a hole in the forest\u0027s canopy and onto a clear patch of ground just large enough for you, Emelyne, and Adroxius to sleep. That night you feast on cold bread, cheese, and smoked meat. \n\n\nMorning comes quickly, and soon enough you are back in the air. The same position, the same route. everything the same. Even the trees. You head south in general, but you have no real idea where Arboribus is, so once you have traveled far enough you\u0027ll have to start searching for a city instead of just flying aimlessly. That\u0027s when it\u0027ll get dangerous, but for now, you revel in the peace you have, for you know it won\u0027t last.\n",

You\u0027ll do what he asks: Follow the horse, kill the muse. Before you know it you\u0027ll be right back on your way to saving Liliana. You did have a month, and at the speed this horse runs, you\u0027ll be able to complete this task in no time.\n\n\nThus, you ready yourself mentally and approach that dark horse once again. For a solid moment you stare into each other\u0027s eyes, and when the moment passes the horse bows itself before you in what you can only assume is an invitation for you to ride it.\n\n\nOne that you do not refuse.\n\n\nYou press your legs into the sides of the bare horse in an attempt to stay on. Its silky mane sifts through your fingers as you grip it, and for one blissful moment you sit atop it without any worry. That feeling disappears when it moves.\n\n\nAt first it walks, but then it starts to canter, and soon enough it\u0027s sprinting at full speed. Your heart drops at the sudden change of pace, and you struggle to stay on the horse without a saddle, but somehow you manage. It helps that you\u0027ve done this once before.\n\n\nDespite having already began sprinting, the horse picks up more and more speed until you can\u0027t see anything but blurred darkness around you. You watch in hopes of being able to glimpse where you are going, but your eyes tear up from the rushed wind and you\u0027re forced to close them. You keep them closed, and the horse keeps on riding.\n\n\nYou continue like this for an indeterminate amount of time before the horse starts to slow down. You wait until the horse is at a full stop, and then you open your eyes. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t know how far you\u0027ve traveled, but you definitely don\u0027t recognize anything around you. At some point in the travels, you and the horse entered into mountainous terrain, and the horse itself is stopped in front of the largest mountain you\u0027ve ever seen. Trees still cover a large portion of it, but its peak rises above those trees and gives the world of green a nice change of color. Or at least, you assume it would if it wasn\u0027t so dark. \n\n\nThe horse only stops for a moment before walking again. This time the pace is rather slow, and you have time to gaze into the darkness around you. Not that you see much, but you at least have the chance to make out some of the images blurred by darkness. You don\u0027t make out much, but you do make out the side of the mountain as the horse walks toward it. \n\n\nAt first you are impressed by the sheer size of the mountain, then you are confused at why the horse continues walking toward the mountain even though you are little more than feet away from it. This continues to appall you up until the very moment that the horse touches the wall, or should have touched the wall. instead of walking into the side of the mountain like you supposed you would, you and the horse simply faze through the side of it into a cave. You\u0027d hoped to see something magical, and here it is.\n\n\nTorches line the walls of the cave illuminating it quite well. At the end of the cave is a massive golden double door. It stands about double your height wide, and triple your height high. An engraving of a mighty dragon is emblazoned upon the front of the door, and in the center of the double doors is a hole about the size of your palm. \n\n\nCuriosity overtakes you, so you hop off of the horse and walk up to the door. It is even more magnificent up close than it is farther away, but, as you near, it isn\u0027t what you see that astounds you. rather, it is what you hear.\n\n\nA voice, more pure and perfect than anything you\u0027ve ever heard prior, sounds through the door. It sings a beautiful song. One that you set to memorize even as you hear it.\n\n\n\"Queen of the lost\n\n\nlies in a cave.\n\n\nTrapped by the king of frost\n\n\nshe must be saved.\n\n\nA key of ruby unlocks the way\n\n\nand through golden doors\n\n\nyour muse awaits.\"\n\n\nDesire to hear that voice closer to you consumes you. You pound at the door hoping, praying that the person beyond the door can hear you, but the doors don\u0027t open. You try several different ideas to open the door, but none of them work. Eventually you stop trying and sit with your back against the door. \n",

  "page 0": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou were really starting to get tired of the color green. The forests were green, the grass was green, even your damn Realm\u0027s emblem was green. It made already boring guard duty even worse. You would pace back and forth staring at the dreadfully large expanse of forest ahead of you, but nothing would ever happen. You might see the occasional kobold walk along the edge of the forest, but they never did anything. They just watched and waited. If you weren\u0027t on a fifty foot high wall you might actually be worried, but, as it happens, you were. There was no kobold in all of the Lost Realm that could scale these walls, and even if there was it, and its disgusting green skin would get peppered with arrows before it had the chance to. Yes, this was simply the easiest most boring place to guard in all of the Realm of Men. \n\n\nIt was because of this fact that your lieutenant was thoroughly confused when you requested to be transferred here. You were his most reliable soldier, and you knew that. You used his fondness of you to get him to give you this transfer. He\u0027d asked why, and you\u0027d simply replied that you needed time to get over what happened to Liliana. Your wife. She was assumed dead by everyone. The night of your wedding you and her were cornered in an alley by thugs. You were beaten to a pulp, and she was taken, in more than one sense of the word, right before your eyes. Her parting words to you before you blacked out from the pain were, \"I\u0027m lost!\" \n\n\nI\u0027m lost. \n\n\nYou take off your wedding ring and examine it. It\u0027s a beautiful piece. Solid gold encrusted with an emerald gem. It is the only green you find yourself being able to stand, and only then because it was from Liliana. Guard duty wasn\u0027t paying you enough for you to be able to get rings for the both of you, so instead you blew all of your money on her ring. That one was polished iron inlaid with golden patterns, and it wasn\u0027t much, but it represented more than money. Liliana accepted your proposal, and when she found out you hadn\u0027t gotten yourself a ring she gave you her mother\u0027s ring. It was a little too girly for you, but the smile on her face turned you into an emotional sob, so you accepted. She was taken that same night. Presumed dead, and with you chosen as her closest \u0027relative\u0027 it was up to you to bury her coffin. You did so quickly. Many people, including your lieutenant, suggested you take things slower, but you were adamant.\n\n\nYou didn\u0027t tell them why you were in such a hurry, and even if you did, you doubt they would\u0027ve believed you. You were the closest person to Liliana and consequently the only one whom she would trust with her secrets. \n\n\nI\u0027m lost.\n\n\nThose words could only mean one thing. They were a confirmation to a question you asked her years ago, when the two of you first met... \n",

  "page 143": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou and Emelyne meet on the morrow as you planned to, and every day for the rest of that week. Gathering supplies, planning routes, and taking a temporary leave from the wall guard takes up much more time than you thought it would. Eventually, however, you do get it done, and the end of the week comes. \n\n\nThe pair of you stand in the field just inside the wall, and check over your supplies one last time. All the food and water you need to survive for weeks lays in packs upon Adroxius\u0027, back. Adroxius doesn\u0027t wear the silver plate armor from before, and instead is fitted in white leather armor. It\u0027s supposed to help you blend in with the clouds as you fly over the realm. The silver armor would draw way too much attention, and be much too heavy to carry long distances. Especially with two riders already on its back. \n\n\nFor weapons, you carry your sword and shield and a dagger. Emelyne carries a long spear with a short sword strapped to her waist. She no longer wears the impressive and highly intimidating armor from before for the same reasons the griffin won\u0027t be wearing its armor. The less weight, the better. Instead, Emelyne wears form fitting chain armor, that, you can\u0027t help but notice, is much more flattering to her figure. You wear similar armor, and together the pair of you look \u0027meant\u0027 for each other. \n\n\nAt least that\u0027s what Redmond had said.\n\n\nHe was obviously joking since you\u0027d already told him about your wife, but the thought sticks in your mind as you mount Adroxius. Emelyne is quite the woman, and you\u0027re not sure how Liliana would feel about you spending so much time with her, but you excuse it quickly enough. I\u0027m only with her for the mission, you tell yourself.\n\n\nEmelyne mounts Adroxius as well, and after you both are strapped in, Emelyne calls a command and Adroxius takes off. The feeling of air rushing past your face is almost immediate, and the feeling of flying is fantastic. The griffin doesn\u0027t fly over the wall just yet, for it would do no good to fly over the wall and immediately alert the kobold to your presence. No, Emelyne instead guides Adroxius slowly up until you are soaring at the height of clouds. It is only then that she steers Adroxius over the wall and to The Lost Realm. \n\n\nThe pace Adroxius flies at is fast at first, but as you pass the edge of the forest, Emelyne slows the pace until it is nice and steady. The flying is easy, and soon enough you find yourself getting bored. That boredom allows you to notice the smallest of details: The acute bite of frost this high up in the air, the weight of your armor on your back, and the small amount of distance between you and Emelyne. \n\n\nThat last one you noticed from the beginning, and you dreaded having to wrap your arms around her waist like a lovelorn fool. Luckily for you, griffin saddles have straps to keep you firmly entrenched upon its back, so you end up not having to hold onto her at all. \n\n\nStill, you aren\u0027t close to women that often, and this situation triggers a memory from several years ago...\n",
  "page 142": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nNormally you don\u0027t get a lot of sleep, but the battle must have tired you out significantly, for you sleep nearly the entire night without waking up. Nearly. That night still haunts your dreams and your very thoughts shy away from remembering it. It is the one memory that you must push away. \n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of silence. It circles around the men in the barracks, and lingers around the empty beds. You can feel the loss of every man in the battle like a weight on your back, and you\u0027re sure the rest of the men here feel the same. A man can\u0027t simply go through what you did, and not be affected. You pull yourself from your bed and get ready. There are people to talk to and decisions to make, and no time to waste in between. \n\n\nIn the short time you\u0027ve been at this wall, not many important things happened. Yesterday was the exception, and from it you learned three things.\n\n\nFirst: The forests of the Lost Realm, or at least the forest edge near the wall, are kobold infested.\n\n\nSecond: Despite the fact that kobold constantly roam the forest, the adventuring party managed to get and out of the forest. Not unscathed of course, but it is possible to do it. \n\n\nThird: It might seem an unimportant factor to most, but it could prove to be a pivotal factor in your survival. Griffins are faster than wyverns. That means that if you were to somehow manage to convince one of the griffin knights to fly you to the forest, then you could avoid many of the dangers that lurk in the Lost Realm. \n\n\nAfter today you will likely have all of the information you can get. Staying any longer would be pointless. \n\n\nSince this wall is short on soldiers, every guard is working double time to cover all of the shifts. Despite this, you do manage to find some pockets of time to go about your personal business. What do you use that time for?\n",
  "page 167": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nNight comes quickly. Compared to the flying you don\u0027t make an insane amount of progress, but the mountains you saw in the air are now visible from the ground as well. \n\n\nYou and Emelyne find a small copse of trees to make camp for the night, and you immediately set to making your bedrolls. No fire tonight. You don\u0027t want to alert any unfriendly things to your presence here.\n\n\nThus, you and Emelyne feast on stale bread and cheese. Emelyne finishes eating before you, and stands up. \n\n\n\"I think I hear a stream nearby. I\u0027m going to go see if I can get washed up some.\" She holds her dirty hands up to you. \n\n\nYou nod with a mouth full of bread, and she heads off in the direction she heard the sound. \n\n\nYou finish eating, and then set to sharpening your blade. It\u0027s a tedious process, and nearly an hour passes by before you finish. Emelyne still hasn\u0027t returned, and you begin to get wary. What if something happened to her? You want to go look for her, but on the chance that she\u0027s just taking a really long time to bathe, you hesitate. \n",
  "page 166": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nIf the wyvern hasn\u0027t already come after you, then it won\u0027t do so for quite a while. You have time, and why not use that time to allow Emelyne to grieve over her feathered friend?\n\n\nYou find a tree, sit down, and lean your back against it. You pay attention to her at first, but soon the adrenaline leaves your body, and you find yourself asleep. \n\n\nSome time later, you awake to someone pushing your shoulder. You open your eyes to see Emelyne hovering over you. Her eyes are still red-rimmed and her expression still sad, but her eyes have a subtle determination about them. \n\n\n\"Come on. We still have a couple of hours before the sun leaves us, so we might want to get some walking done,\" Emelyne tells you.\n\n\nYou rub your eyes before looking around the area. The wyvern corpse still lies in a heap a little ways away, but when you look for Adroxius\u0027 body, you don\u0027t see it. Instead you see a helmet with wings on it on top of a mound of freshly dug dirt. You give Emelyne a quick once over, and you see her dirt stained hands, so it isn\u0027t hard for you to figure out that she must\u0027ve spent the last hour or so burying Adroxius. \n\n\nYou see the sky starting to turn an orange color, and you wonder how long you were asleep. The ambush did happen in the morning, so seeing the evening sky somewhat astounds you. \n\n\n\"How long was I out?\" you ask her. \n\n\nShe looks at the sky as well, then shrugs. \"Five hours? Somewhere around there.\" \n\n\nFive hours? You hadn\u0027t even meant to fall asleep. Let alone for five hours. Emelyne drinks from a canteen of water by the supplies, and, you now notice, no longer has her armor on. Instead, a brown leather tunic with brown men style trousers adorn her body.\n\n\n\"No armor?\" \n\n\nShe shakes her head. \"If we\u0027re going to walk the rest of the distance, then I suggest you shed yours too. That\u0027s some weight you don\u0027t want to wear all of the time.\" \n\n\nYou hesitate before speaking again. \"About that. Today you saved my life. Without you I would\u0027ve likely died a long time ago. I release you from your oath. You no longer have to continue on with me.\" \n\n\nShe stares at you in shock. \"What?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m saying that you don\u0027t have to follow me the rest of the way. You\u0027ve saved my life, so you shouldn\u0027t have to follow me around in this godforsaken place. Especially since being with me might end with you dying.\" You shed your chain armor as you do this. Similar clothes to hers already adorn you.\n\n\nEmelyne walks toward you, and, with a quick movement, slaps you in the face. The sound echoes through the forest, and you find yourself slightly confused, but then you realize that this is what you get. This is her payment to you for forcing her on this mission, and for you getting her most trusted companion killed. The slap is justice. \n\n\n\"\"What are you talking about! I\u0027m not going to abandon you now. Are you insane?\" You see tears start to form in her eyes once more. \"It was me who offered my service to you. This is on me. Not you. Even if I am free, do you really think I\u0027m going to leave you here alone? I might as well kill you now if that\u0027s the case.\" \n\n\nYou look at her somewhat bewildered as she continues speaking, \"What did you think I was going to do? Walk the rest of the way back through kobold infested forests by myself? I\u0027d get lost, or killed. Is that what you want? For me to die?\" Tears are streaming from her face freely now. \"I\u0027m sorry. Dammit. I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t get you to your wife, and I\u0027m sorry that we\u0027re probably going to die here in this forest!\" \n\n\nShe stops speaking, and she breathes in and out heavily. Why was she apologizing to you? None of this was her fault. You were the one who accepted her service and brought her on this trip. Not her.\n\n\n\"What do you mean you\u0027re sorry? None of this is your fault. I shouldn\u0027t have brought you with me from the start. Because of me Adroxius is dead,\" Emelyne winces at that, \"and we\u0027re stranded in the middle of nowhere! We have no real idea of where we are, and-and-\" For the first time in years you find tears rise to your face. The gravity of the situation hits you like a sword in the stomach. \"And I\u0027ll never find Liliana! She could be dead by now for all I know. I\u0027ve wasted your time, and your life here all for the chance I could find my wife. So I\u0027m sorry.\" \n\n\nTears flow down your face as well, and your breathing becomes hitched. For a single seemingly infinite moment you two stare at each other in anger, sadness, and regret. Then she steps close to you, and you brace yourself for another slap. Instead she wraps her arms around you, and throws her head onto your chest. She starts sobbing there, and you are left stunned, but only for a moment. After that, you wrap your arms around her and pull her closer to you. You press your head down into the side of her neck, and you start sobbing uncontrollably.\n\n\nEver since Liliana was captured, you\u0027d been in a constant state of hiding your feelings. all of the pent up anger and sadness flow out now. At some point you sink to the ground, and for some time you both sit there in each others arms crying for different reasons. After a while, you both cease your crying, and you feel a headache start to come on. Despite that, you oddly feel better. \n\n\nEmelyne frees herself from your grasp. \"We should get going.\" \n\n\nYou nod your agreement, stand up, then start to gather your various supplies. Emelyne does the same, and shortly thereafter you head off further into the forest. \n",
  "page 169": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nEmelyne is punctual. Even if Adroxius died yesterday, she isn\u0027t the kind of person to take an hour to bathe. \n\n\nYou get up from your bedroll, strap your sword to your waist, then set out in the direction Emelyne went. You don\u0027t hear a stream at first, but eventually you do. You follow the sound until you come into a clearing. \n\n\nIn the center of that clearing is a small pond. The stream leads to and out of it from your left to your right, and this is normal. What isn\u0027t normal is that the water glows. It glows a shimmering light blue color in the pond, but the glow fades the farther the stream gets away from the pond. A massive tree stands at the opposite end of the clearing. It\u0027s several feet in diameter, but the majority of it has been hollowed and renovated into a house of sorts. \n\n\nIn your taking stock of the setting, you almost fail to notice Emelyne.

Bathing with a bunch of naked women is fine for a married guy, right? You think of Liliana for a moment, but a deeper more primal feeling pushes the thought away. \n\n\nAs you near the pond you start shrugging off your clothes. Emelyne jumps back into the pond, and you follow. \n\n\nThe water is blindingly cold, and you jump out in surprise. \"It\u0027s cold Emelyne!\" \n\n\nShe just laughs, then reaches for your hand to pull you back in. You jerk away at first, but each time she tries, your will to resist grow weaker and weaker. Eventually she is successful, and pulls you back into the water. \n\n\nYou start smiling and laughing uncontrollably, and your senses cloud over. Who cares if the water is cold? This is fun. You bathe and splash around with Emelyne and her companions for a good while before the other two women approach you seductively. \n\n\nYou let them, and they start bathing you.

You resist Emelyne\u0027s pulling, and then, in one sudden motion, pull her to you and throw her over your shoulder.\n\n\n\"Hey!\" she shouts at you in mock anger, but then descends into a fit of giggles. You hear the two women in the pond giggling uncontrollably as well, as you run back to your campsite. \n\n\nWhen you get there you set Emelyne down, and immediately search through her packs for some spare clothes. \n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Emelyne asks you in a voice that is oddly...seductive. \n\n\nYou turn in her direction in time to see her stalk toward you in that same seductive nature. Her lust-filled eyes center in on you. \"I\u0027m trying to find you some cloth-\" you start, but are promptly interrupted.\n\n\n\"You don\u0027t like me like this?\" she pouts, then pulls at your arm. \n\n\nYou turn to face her in order to tell her off, but before you can get a word out, she is kissing you. Her soft lips press against yours, and her hands trail all over your body. \n\n\nAnd for a single solemn moment, you don\u0027t want her to stop.\n",

You think of Liliana for a moment, but a deeper more primal feeling shoves the thought away. \n\n\nYou let Emelyne pull you towards the pond, and as you near you start shrugging off your clothes. Emelyne jumps back into the pond, and you follow. \n\n\nThe water is blindingly cold, and you jump out in surprise. \"It\u0027s cold Emelyne!\" \n\n\nShe just laughs, then reaches for your hand to pull you back in. You jerk away at first, but each time she tries, your will to resist grow weaker and weaker. Eventually she is successful, and pulls you back into the water. \n\n\nYou start smiling and laughing uncontrollably, and your senses cloud over. Who cares if the water is cold? This is fun. You bathe and splash around with Emelyne and her companions for a good while before the other two women approach you seductively. \n\n\nYou let them, and they start bathing you for you. You enjoy it, and they start encouraging you to sit down in the water. You, still smiling, oblige them. \n\n\nThen, with a suddenness you\u0027ve never seen before, the black haired one grabs your head and forces you underwater. You are surprised, but you don\u0027t resist until you realize what\u0027s happening, and even then you can\u0027t free yourself from their grasp. \n\n\nThe last thing you hear is Emelyne\u0027s joyous laughter as it filters through the air. \n",

You lose sight of your mission, the fact that you\u0027re married, and any thought about your future. \n\n\nInstead, you indulge your primal urges. Your hands grasp at her hair urging, wanting her closer. You envelop yourself in her touch, and give in to every impulse that enters your body. After a short while she starts tearing at your clothes, so you take those off. \n\n\nWith no clothes to stop either of you, you begin to engage in every manner of intercourse. The process is long, heated, and thoroughly satisfying.\n\n\nHours later you lie in your bedroll with a naked Emelyne clinging to your chest asleep.

I don\u0027t know what they did to you, but this is not what you, nor I want.\" \n\n\nShe mumbles against your chest. \"You don\u0027t want me?\" and then proceeds to start crying in your chest.

In a couple of minutes she is dressed, and has calmed both her crying, and her hormones down. Still, instead of going to her own bedroll she walks to yours and sits down beside you. \n\n\n\"Hold me tonight?\" she asks you.\n\n\n\"Sure,\" you tell her hesitantly. \n\n\nShe then immediately curls up next to you and closes her eyes.

It looses an arrow at you, and it pierces your throat sending spurts of blood in every direction. You let go of your sword, and it tumbles through the air.

Carefully, and quite slowly, you stand on top of the griffin\u0027s back. The surface isn\u0027t very flat, and the flight isn\u0027t very steady, so you almost fall several times. Somehow, however, you manage to stand. \n\n\nArrows fly at you and Emelyne, but they are poorly aimed so you don\u0027t get hit. You turn around on top of Adroxius and face the two wyverns. There\u0027s one on either side of the griffin, and both are gaining quickly. If there was ever a time to enact your plan, it was now. \n\n\nYou leap into the air toward the wyvern closest to you. \n\n\nBased on your calculations, the wyvern should be flying fast enough for it to get to you in midair before you started falling. \n\n\nIt doesn\u0027t. \n\n\nYou start falling just before the wyvern gets to your location in the air, and you plummet towards the trees.

The kobold on the wyvern to your right are either dead or maimed, but the ones on the left are alive and kicking. \n\n\nYou raise your bloodied sword and point it at the two kobold left. \"We can catch them now!\" \n\n\nYou see Emelyne nod, and she urges Adroxius to go faster, but it doesn\u0027t. It is only then, that you and Emelyne notice the arrow protruding from Adroxius\u0027 side. Your mouth turns dry as you instead start to slow down. Not because Emelyne had Adroxius slow, but because it is simply losing the energy it needs to fly. \n\n\n\"We need to land!\" Emelyne shouts to you. \n\n\nYou nod. \"I\u0027ll try and cover us!\" \n\n\nEmelyne steers Adroxius around and downward.

Many more arrows get sent your way in the time it takes to get close to the ground, and you only end up blocking the ones that come near you and Emelyne. While you do still try and block the arrows coming at Adroxius, you miss many of them. \n\n\nMoments later, you break through the canopy of the forest. Emelyne attempts to land but you are falling too quickly and, instead of landing softly, Adroxius slams hard into the ground. The broken griffin slides along the ground for several feet before its momentum stops. As soon as that happens, Emelyne leaps from its back and onto the ground beside it. \n\n\n\"Adroxius, no. Please stay here. Please...\" You hear her voice start to quiver, and you turn away. \n\n\nA mighty crash sounds through the area, and you see the wyvern with kobold crash through the canopy. Similar to Adroxius\u0027 landing, it is rough and it is a wonder the kobold manage to stay atop the beast.

You raise your shield to block an arrow, but you hear the sound of blade piercing flesh, so you lower it. The projectile, as it turns out, was none other than Emelyne\u0027s spear. She threw it across the short distance and managed to skewer the kobold archer through the chest.\n\n\nShe then wastes no time in rushing to the downed wyvern and beheading the last kobold. Following this, she brings her sword down onto the wyvern just in case it managed to survive the crash. When she turns back to you, her eyes are no longer ablaze with vengeance and wrath. Instead sadness pervades them.\n\n\nYou turn to look at Adroxius. Arrows pepper its body, and if that wasn\u0027t enough its wings are broken in several places from the fall. You can\u0027t tell too well, because its hide is black, but you think that Adroxius is bleeding all over.\n\n\nYour heart drops. This is your fault. You were the one that wanted to use a griffin to fly out here, but now, as you look at the somber scene of Emelyne crying over her noble creature\u0027s body, you find yourself regretting it. \n\n\nYou feel like you should say something to her, but you don\u0027t know what, so you settle with salvaging supplies from Adroxius\u0027 dead body. Admittedly it isn\u0027t the most sensitive move you could\u0027ve made, but Emelyne doesn\u0027t yell at you, so you consider it fine. \n\n\nYou finish gathering your supplies, and are left waiting for Emelyne to stop mourning. Her tears have stopped, but she still kneels at its body. Her head is bowed, and she mutters something, so you can only assume she is praying. \n\n\nYou let her go at this for a time, but soon you start to get impatient. It isn\u0027t that you don\u0027t want her to mourn, but you don\u0027t know if that other wyvern is going to come back anytime soon. You don\u0027t want to be here if it does.\n",

You pay attention to her at first, but soon the adrenaline leaves your body, and you find yourself asleep. \n\n\nSome time later, you awake to someone pushing your shoulder. You open your eyes to see Emelyne hovering over you. Her eyes are still red-rimmed and her expression still sad, but her eyes have a subtle determination about them. \n\n\n\"Come on. We still have a couple of hours before the sun leaves us, so we might want to get some walking done,\" Emelyne tells you.\n\n\nYou rub your eyes before looking around the area. The wyvern corpse still lies in a heap a little ways away, but when you look for Adroxius\u0027 body, you don\u0027t see it. Instead you see a helmet with wings on it on top of a mound of freshly dug dirt. You give Emelyne a quick once over, and you see her dirt stained hands, so it isn\u0027t hard for you to figure out that she must\u0027ve spent the last hour or so burying Adroxius. \n\n\nYou see the sky starting to turn an orange color, and you wonder how long you were asleep. The ambush did happen in the morning, so seeing the evening sky somewhat astounds you. \n\n\n\"How long was I out?\" you ask her. \n\n\nShe looks at the sky as well, then shrugs. \"Five hours? Somewhere around there.\" \n\n\nFive hours? You hadn\u0027t even meant to fall asleep. Let alone for five hours. Emelyne drinks from a canteen of water by the supplies, and, you now notice, no longer has her armor on. Instead, a brown leather tunic with brown men style trousers adorn her body.\n\n\n\"No armor?\" \n\n\nShe shakes her head. \"If we\u0027re going to walk the rest of the distance, then I suggest you shed yours too. That\u0027s some weight you don\u0027t want to wear all of the time.\" \n\n\nYou hesitate before speaking again. \"About that. Today you saved my life. Without you I would\u0027ve likely died a long time ago. I release you from your oath. You no longer have to continue on with me.\" \n\n\nShe stares at you in shock. \"What?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m saying that you don\u0027t have to follow me the rest of the way. You\u0027ve saved my life, so you shouldn\u0027t have to follow me around in this godforsaken place. Especially since being with me might end with you dying.\" You shed your chain armor as you do this. Similar clothes to hers already adorn you.\n\n\nEmelyne walks toward you, and, with a quick movement, slaps you in the face. The sound echoes through the forest, and you find yourself slightly confused, but then you realize that this is what you get. This is her payment to you for forcing her on this mission, and for you getting her most trusted companion killed. The slap is justice. \n\n\n\"\"What are you talking about! I\u0027m not going to abandon you now. Are you insane?\" You see tears start to form in her eyes once more. \"It was me who offered my service to you. This is on me. Not you. Even if I am free, do you really think I\u0027m going to leave you here alone? I might as well kill you now if that\u0027s the case.\" \n\n\nYou look at her somewhat bewildered as she continues speaking, \"What did you think I was going to do? Walk the rest of the way back through kobold infested forests by myself? I\u0027d get lost, or killed. Is that what you want? For me to die?\" Tears are streaming from her face freely now. \"I\u0027m sorry. Dammit. I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t get you to your wife, and I\u0027m sorry that we\u0027re probably going to die here in this forest!\" \n\n\nShe stops speaking, and she breathes in and out heavily. Why was she apologizing to you? None of this was her fault. You were the one who accepted her service and brought her on this trip. Not her.\n\n\n\"What do you mean you\u0027re sorry? None of this is your fault. I shouldn\u0027t have brought you with me from the start. Because of me Adroxius is dead,\" Emelyne winces at that, \"and we\u0027re stranded in the middle of nowhere! We have no real idea of where we are, and-and-\" For the first time in years you find tears rise to your face. The gravity of the situation hits you like a sword in the stomach. \"And I\u0027ll never find Liliana! She could be dead by now for all I know. I\u0027ve wasted your time, and your life here all for the chance I could find my wife. So I\u0027m sorry.\" \n\n\nTears flow down your face as well, and your breathing becomes hitched. For a single seemingly infinite moment you two stare at each other in anger, sadness, and regret. Then she steps close to you, and you brace yourself for another slap. Instead she wraps her arms around you, and throws her head onto your chest. She starts sobbing there, and you are left stunned, but only for a moment. After that, you wrap your arms around her and pull her closer to you. You press your head down into the side of her neck, and you start sobbing uncontrollably.\n\n\nEver since Liliana was captured, you\u0027d been in a constant state of hiding your feelings. all of the pent up anger and sadness flow out now. At some point you sink to the ground, and for some time you both sit there in each others arms crying for different reasons. After a while, you both cease your crying, and you feel a headache start to come on. Despite that, you oddly feel better. \n\n\nEmelyne frees herself from your grasp. \"We should get going.\" \n\n\nYou nod your agreement, stand up, then start to gather your various supplies. Emelyne does the same, and shortly thereafter you head off further into the forest. \n",

When climbing you find one of these patches and you send loose stone tumbling down the wall. The sound isn\u0027t too loud, so you hope no one will notice, yet your heart stays on edge as you approach the top of the wall. \n\n\nYour hands grasp the edges of the ramparts, and you heave yourself up and onto the wall. You look around the wall for guards first, and when you see none, you turn toward the city, and are immediately taken aback by its beauty. Polished cobblestones make up the roads, and each of the buildings take advantage of the natural art exhibited from stone. The tree in the center looks even more imposing now, and you think that this would be a nice place to visit if your reason for being here was different.\n\n\nAs you admire the city, you hear footsteps on the wall. You react by lowering yourself down onto the inside of the wall, and attempting to get off the wall before the guard comes. You have no such luck, and the guard sees you and immediately raises the alarm. You climb down the wall, and take off down the road. Various guards run after you until nearly ten follow in pursuit. You don\u0027t wear armor, and fairly easily outrun them, but they know the city better than you do. Despite your best efforts, the faerie guards eventually manage to corner and restrain you.\n\n\nYou don\u0027t try to escape, for that would be suicide. Still, you only grudgingly follow as they lead you through the city and into a prison. A few faeries are in there, and even a kobold or two, but no humans. They lead you to an empty cell, throw you in there, and lock the door. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t know how you\u0027re going to get out of this situation. The fact is that you went and gotten yourself stuck in a prison instead of where you should be. You lower your head in despair. You don\u0027t know how long they\u0027ll keep you here.

You retreat farther into the forest to wait for the hours to pass by.\n\n\n~\n\n\nDarkness descends upon you, but you don\u0027t feel tired. Adrenaline pumps through your veins as you make your way back to Arboribus. Lights sit all along the walls, and for the most part nothing has changed about the wall. For the lesser part, there is one thing that has changed, and that is that the guards are even more lax now than during the day. \n\n\nThis plays to your benefit as you make your way to the wall. You approach a side of the wall with almost no attentive guards, and then you immediately set to work. The walls weren\u0027t built by the greatest hand, so you find yourself being able to climb the uneven surface fairly easily. \n\n\nYou place one foot after another until you are three fourths of the way up.

Soon you take to singing the song yourself and with Emelyne, but it\u0027s never as good as that voice. You run out of food and water in your packs after the first few weeks, and you are tempted many times to leave the cave in search of food, but every time you remember the song. The song keeps you strong. It keeps you satisfied. That, and hopelessly pushing at the door for hours on end for the smallest chance that it will magically fall over.

It fits the song\u0027s description perfectly, and, well, you are out of ideas on how to get through the door anyway.\n\n\nYou stand up once more, take the gem out of your pack and place it into the hole in the door. The space between the double doors starts glowing a bright red, then, after a few moments, the doors open. The emblazoned dragon is split in half, and the gem falls from the hole in the center of the door onto the cave floor. You pick it up, and gaze into the room beyond.

It also has the exact same dragon emblazoned in the center of it. You also no longer stand on the rough floor of the cave, and instead you find yourself on polished marble. You look up to see a vaulted ceiling held up by white pillars, then around you to see two hallways to your left and right. \n\n\nA woman with fiery red hair and a perfect body stands before the pair of you. She is clothed in a white gown of the finest make, and her emerald eyes look at the pair of you curiously.\n\n\nFor a single long moment no one speaks, but then Emelyne, bless her courage, breaks the silence. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\n\"Why only the most beautiful, most powerful, and the most knowledgeable person in all of the Lost Realm! I\u0027m the muse of fire, Raynalixa.\" She introduces herself proudly. \"Are you two here to save me?\" she asks hopefully.\n\n\nEmelyne responds again, \"I\u0027m sorry, but we were only seeking shelter from the storm-\"\n\n\nYou pitch in, \"But if you are a muse, and are also so knowledgeable, then surely you know where Arboribus is, right?\" You brace yourself for the worst.\n\n\n\"Of course I know where Arboribus is. It\u0027s not too far south from here. Why do you ask?\" \n\n\nYou and Emelyne exchange an excited look. \"There is someone I need to see there,\" you respond simply. Despite this being a \u0027muse,\u0027 you don\u0027t feel any real desire to stay and chat. The oddly grandiose room reeks of magic, and magic isn\u0027t the safest of things. You\u0027d rather stay in the cold cave. \n\n\n\"Now if you don\u0027t mind, Raynalixa, I think we\u0027ll be on our way.\" You and Emelyne then start to turn around only to here the dreaded words pierce your ears. \n\n\n\"Oh, you can\u0027t leave now,\" the muse calls after you.\n\n\nYou and Emelyne stop in your tracks. \"Why not?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s just the way this place works. For every group of people that enter in, one must remain.\" You eye her incredulously, and she expounds. \"Go right ahead, and try.

If this was true, then only one of you would be able to continue. You look at Emelyne, and she starts to open her mouth to speak. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll st-\" she starts, but you interrupt her. \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t even say it.

  "page 187": "Year 374 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou wake to the unpleasant feeling of being pulled from your bed. The hands that grab you are rough, and you know them very well. Your father tosses you to the worn wooden floor. \n\n\n\"You took my gold!\" His voice is slurred, and you can tell he just finished a drinking session. \n\n\nYou didn\u0027t, in fact, take his gold like he accuses. But it doesn\u0027t matter what you say, for the result will be the same anyway. That result comes in the form of a hard boot in your abdomen.\n\n\nYou grunt slightly in pain. It hurts, but it is bearable. \"Now I can\u0027t pay the rent dammit! What\u0027d you do? Spend it on whores?\" \n\n\nAnother kick greets your stomach. You don\u0027t tell him that the reason the gold was gone was because he spent all of it on ale, and on whores. He was a hypocrite.\n\n\nHe tries to throw more insults your way, but you\u0027ve stopped listening. You focus on the pain, the feeling of his worn boots kicking you over and over again. You feel your ribs bruise, and you curl into a ball on the floor. He can\u0027t get to your stomach, so he starts kicking at your legs until those start bruising too. \n\n\nYou feel tears force their way out of your eyes from the pain. It\u0027s the same pain that causes you to lose focus of everything around you. You lose track of how long the beating goes on, for the monotonous pain of it all leaves your mind muddled. \n\n\nIt is then that you hear the worst possible thing. \n\n\n\"Get off him!\" Her voice would normally be a good thing. Something for you to celebrate, but now it is was something to fear. Your father was a horrible person when sober, but an evil person when drunk. He would hurt Liliana as easily as he hurts you. \n\n\nThe kicks stop, and you feel the unmistakable impression that something bad is about to happen. This impression is confirmed moments later in the form of a slap. You look up to see your beloved Liliana standing before your drunkard of a father with her hand raised in the air. The right side of his face is red, and you even think you see some blood on his cheek.\n\n\nThis is not cause for celebration. You would have rather been kicked than see your father\u0027s face glow with anger. He clenches his fist and returns to Liliana what she gave him. She is sent to the floor, and you struggle hopelessly to stand up. Your ribs are bruised, maybe broken, and your left knee pulses with pain. Still, you struggle. You will not lay by and allow Liliana to get beaten.\n\n\nBut it is not beating that your father wants to do. \"Is this one of those whore bitches you spent my gold on?\" your father shouts at you before kneeling beside Liliana and grasping at her clothes like a possessed beast. Her tunic rips open, and your father immediately sets his grimy alcohol stained hands to grabbing. All the while Liliana slaps, hits and shoves, but try as she might, she can\u0027t get him off her.\n\n\nHer gorgeous azure eyes fill with tears and she looks at you with a pleading look in her eyes. A look that will be etched into your memory for the rest of your life. Just like the look your father gives you when you finally manage to stand up, and slam your hand into the side of his head. You aim right at his temple, and you do this intentionally, for you learned in guard academy the best ways to take out assailants. \n\n\nYour fist crushes into the side of his head, and your father is sent to the side reeling. You immediately check on Liliana. Her clothes are torn, and she has a nasty bruise on her face, but, and thankfully so, her virtue wasn\u0027t compromised. \n\n\nYour dad drunkenly stands back up and looks at you bewildered. Then he immediately sets to swinging a drunken fist at your face.  Hurt as you are, he is drunk, and you are trained in fighting. You take that punch and stop it with one hand. With your other you slam your fist onto the outside of his elbow. You hear a sickening crunch as you break his arm, and your father cries out in pain, but you aren\u0027t done there. No, your father attempted to hurt all you hold dear in this life, and he is not going to get off easy. \n\n\nYou shower kick after kick, and punch after punch into your father\u0027s body. You beat him worse than he ever beat you, and, with tears in her eyes, Liliana watches on. Despite her sweet spirit, she was passionate about her loved ones.

Nor anger or sadness. you feel nothing, but that you did what needed to be done. Your father won\u0027t hurt you any longer, and he definitely won\u0027t touch Liliana. \n\n\nTiredly, you grab Liliana\u0027s hand and walk with her out of the room. The deed was done.

  "page 29": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nBlood seeps through the chain armor you\u0027re wearing. It isn\u0027t your own, but it really makes wearing armor uncomfortable. After your pivotal role in the battle, you\u0027re left among the living to help search the corpses of the fallen. The typical after battle duties: Kill any remaining enemies, help the wounded, and collect the bodies. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t the most glamorous job, but it sure beats fighting to stay alive. More than half of division one was killed, as was most of division two. Lieutenant Byron was included in this number.  Half of the adventuring group that the kobold were chasing in the first place, was killed, and those whom survived stayed behind to help with the gathering of the bodies. They, however, claimed the right to the bodies of their fallen comrades, and you were supposed to notify them should you find any of them. \n\n\nYou remember this when you find one of their fallen comrades. It\u0027s a man in silver plate armor with a massive double bladed battleaxe on the ground by his side. At first it doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s sustained any wounds, but, upon closer inspection, you see that his throat was cut and in a crude manner at that. You\u0027re about to call out for the group, but just as you open your mouth, a glimmer of shining red catches your eye. You close your mouth, and a sense of morbid curiosity overcomes you. The shining red light is coming from inside the folds of the fallen man\u0027s armor, and it isn\u0027t the distinctive crimson color of red. You take a quick glance around to make sure no one is watching, then reach down and stick your hand through the gaps of the man\u0027s armor. Your hand closes around a cold object, and you pull it free. \n\n\nA mesmerizing red object greets your vision. A ruby, about the size of your palm, sits in your hand. This kind of gem is wildly rare, and would likely buy you a fortune if you were to sell it. You see a brief vision of you with Liliana, not living in some rundown house, and instead living with land of your own and plenty of inheritance for your eventual children. You nearly take it then, but a thought stops you. A guy like this wouldn\u0027t just keep something this valuable on his person. No, he would\u0027ve already sold it. This gem was likely the result of his group\u0027s recent excursion into the forest. It might even be, just maybe, the reason the kobold were after these people so ferociously. If you were to take it now, and then enter the Lost Realm, well, you guess kobold would be hunting you to the ends of the realm. \n\n\nStill, it does look quite valuable.\n",
  "page 24": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThis won\u0027t be the first time you\u0027ve done something crazy, though it is likely the one with the most at stake. \n\n\nYou pry yourself from the claws of the griffin and fall into the open air. Your plan...\n",
  "page 23": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou start a light jog to the wyvern infested ramparts, but you stop before you get there and string your bow. What is the point in throwing yourself into the middle of danger for nothing? Chances are that you would die a gruesome death for no reason other than your eagerness for battle. An inexperienced fool\u0027s death. \n\n\nWith your bow stringed and the wyverns attention away from you, you start taking shots at the beasts. You aim your first few shots at the wyverns themselves, but when they bounce harmlessly off of their scaly hides, you shift your focus. There are two kobold atop each of the five wyverns present, and while they are certainly dwarfed by the sheer size of the wyverns they are riding, you don\u0027t let that distract you. Each of the kobold atop the wyvern has a critical purpose. The one in the front is to steer and control the mount while the one in the back holds a bow in its hands. It\u0027s job is to fire at anyone attempting to kill the former type of kobold. Such as you. \n\n\nThe wyvern you\u0027d been concentrating on turns its attention toward you, as does the kobold archer atop it, but it never gets a chance to loose its arrow at you. Instead your own arrow pierces its chest sending it tumbling from its mount and into the open air. Unfortunately, the other kobold still sits atop the wyvern, and after your display of accuracy, you\u0027ve become a prime target. That wyvern and its rider come flying toward you, which is bad, but away from the battle, which is good. You take the last opportunity you\u0027ll get and loose one more arrow at the other kobold. Your aim is off on this, so your arrow only ends up bouncing off of the wyvern\u0027s body. You start to draw another arrow, but as you do, the wyvern takes on a burst of speed and is on you before you know it. Your life flashes before your eyes, and an image of Liliana\u0027s beautiful face plants itself at the forefront of your mind. You simply don\u0027t have enough time to react to the wyvern\u0027s speed, and you just close your eyes in acceptance. \n\n\nThen you feel a large claw grab your waist. Its touch is surprising gentle. Nothing of what you would expect of a wyvern, and you keep waiting for it to hurl you from its grip, but that doesn\u0027t happen. Hesitantly, you open your eyes to find yourself suspended in the air, and not in the grasp of a wyvern. Rather, you find yourself in the grip of a griffin. The relief you feel is instantaneous, but that is quickly replaced by terror. You quickly reach your hands and grip onto the cold claws of the griffin. \n\n\nYou take stock of the situation. Including the griffin carrying you, there are at least seven Griffin Knights combating the wyverns in the air. It\u0027s  an amazing scene, and your breath catches. Griffins are much smaller than the wyverns, but this makes them significantly faster, so the wyverns seeme clumsy by comparison. The griffin knights themselves wear gleaming silver armor and cast a perfect picture of the word \u0027knight.\u0027 On the ground, the fight continues. The kobold outnumber division one, by nearly two to one, and that is discounting the giant lizards they brought with them to the battle. You start wondering why so many kobold came to mount an attack on the wall, but are soon distracted from that with what happens next.\n\n\nYou feel a sudden change in direction as the griffin carrying you heads back to the walls. You realize that it, and the rider, must want to drop you back off at the wall before returning to the melee. You are quite okay with this, but then a scene just below you unfolds in the span of a moment. \n\n\nA wyvern, with just the rider left to guide it, chases a griffin just below you. For that moment it seems the entire world slows down in order for you to see and understand what\u0027s happening. The wyvern is gaining, and it opens its mouth in anticipation for the coming chomp on the griffin\u0027s lower half. It isn\u0027t some beast\u0027s wild hope that it\u0027ll manage to bite the griffin either. No, you can very clearly see that this wyvern will be able to catch the griffin. Thus leading to both the griffin\u0027s and its rider\u0027s death. \n\n\nIn this same moment, an utterly absurd idea crosses your mind. The griffin holding you wasn\u0027t trying to keep you prisoner. It was merely keeping you from falling, and you think you could pry yourself open from its grip if you really tried. If you did, then you should land just as the wyvern\u0027s saddle passes beneath you. Your weight might even be enough to cause the wyvern to lose the edge its gained on the griffin. You left your bow back on the ramparts when the griffin saved you from the wyvern, but you do still have your standard short sword strapped to your waist. If you did go through with such a ridiculous plan, you could maybe even take out the rider and wyvern. \n\n\nMaybe.\n",
  "page 26": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYour heart nearly stops as you fall towards the monstrous beast. You even start panicking when, for a moment, you think you timed it wrong. But your aim was true, and you land solidly on the back of the wyvern. The weight of you and your armor is enough to throw the beast off its course. Out of the corner of your eye you see the griffin and its knight escape, but you ignore both that, and the pain between your legs, and instead focus on the task at hand. \n\n\nHaving pulled your sword out as you fell, you now thrust it through the back of the kobold rider. It shrieks in surprise, and then promptly falls from the saddle and into the melee below, taking your sword with it. Weaponless, you sit on the back of a wyvern that might, at any given moment, toss you from its saddle and to your death. \n\n\nSo you do the only sensible thing left. You grab the reins and attempt to steer it. The wyvern responds, and readily so at that. They might be disgusting, scaly, and  carnal creatures, but they did know how to train a beast. You find that it\u0027s surprisingly like steering a horse, and with this knowledge you enact stage three of your plan. \n\n\nYou immediately steer the beast toward the ground, and toward the back of the kobold host. The wyvern doesn\u0027t hesitate until the very end, but by then it\u0027s too late. The wyvern, with you atop it, crashes head first into the back of the kobold host. This takes out many of the kobold effectively removing the kobold\u0027s only advantage, their superior numbers. \n\n\nYou feel slightly bruised as you get off the incapacitated wyvern, onto the ground beside it. Kobold and giant lizard bodies litter the ground, so you take the time it takes for the dust to settle from your crash landing to search for a sword. Which you do end up finding, but it\u0027s is of kobold make and is therefore much smaller than what you\u0027re used to. It is more of a dagger than a sword when in human hands. \n\n\nThe dust settles, and the kobold stare at you in utter disbelief. It is only then that you realize that you are now behind the enemy host, and with only a dagger for a weapon. The kobold seem to realize this as well, and almost in unison those not fighting on their line stalk towards you with weapons raised. You prepare to die for the second time today, but you are saved once again. \n\n\n\"To me!\" yu hear Byron\u0027s voice shout over the melee, and the kobold who were approaching you moments before turn to their new enemy. \n\n\nYou look as well, and you see a sight to behold. Byron, having managed to gain a foothold in the kobold\u0027s line, gathered his men in a spearhead formation and fought his way towards you. With their line broken, and their numbers dwindling, the kobold start to panic. This makes finishing them off even easier, and you, along with Byron and the rest of division one, proceed to rout the rest of the kobold. Sure a few escape here and there, but the majority of them are slain and lie in piles on the blood soaked battleground.\n",
  "page 25": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nSure you\u0027ve done crazy things in the past, but this is no time to try and accomplish the utterly insane. Especially when the chances of success are so very low. Better to live and keep your chance of saving Liliana alive rather than to throw it away on the unlikely chance that you\u0027ll be able to save some random nobody.\n\n\nDespite this fact, you still wince when you see the wyvern\u0027s mouth snap down on the griffins hindquarters. The scene turns into a bloody mess, and you can\u0027t help but look away as the griffin (or at least what\u0027s left of it) and its rider plummet down to the battle below. \n\n\nYou feel a pang of guilt, but you push it away by telling yourself you couldn\u0027t have done anything anyway. Yet, somewhere in the back of your mind, you don\u0027t believe this. \n\n\nNot too long after that you are dropped off on the ramparts you were originally guarding. Much is different. Several chunks of the wall are missing, and many soldiers lie dead on the ramparts. The wall you once guarded no longer carries that symbol of boredom and ease in your mind. It is readily replaced with the memory of blood spilt, and comrades dying. \n\n\nOver half of division two is either dead or incapacitated. Division on was doing better, but the griffin that was killed only moments before plummeted right into their line. That turned out to be the turning point in the kobold\u0027s favor, and now division one is slowly being pushed back against the wall. The griffins are locked in a very deadly battle with the rest of the wyverns, and don\u0027t seem at all in a position to help the human forces on the ground. \n\n\nYou aren\u0027t sure what you could do to help in this situation, for it looks like your defeat is inevitable. The griffins won\u0027t be able to kill the wyverns fast enough to help division one avoid getting slaughtered, which division one is mere minutes away from. This leaves you with a few honorable choices and one dishonorable choice. \n",
  "page 27": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYour timing was horribly off. You jump much too early and find yourself face to face with the open mouth of a wyvern. It must think you\u0027re the griffin, for as soon as you even near its mouth it snaps its mouth shut on top of you. Your midsection is torn to pieces, and you die instantly. \n\n\nAt least you can die well knowing that you saved that Griffin Knight.\n",
  "page 20": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou know you won\u0027t have enough time to get entirely out of the range of the wyvern\u0027s claws. It\u0027s better to duck and hope for the best than to definitely die. \n\n\nYou follow this thought and duck behind the ramparts. The wyvern makes its pass, and perhaps from sheer luck, you pass between its hind legs. Stones from the ramparts on either side of you crumble and fall away, but you remain fairly unscathed. \n\n\nYou thought you were going to die for sure, and, after finding out you managed to scrape by, you stand up in a fit of pure relief. You celebrate too early, however, for a kobold archer from the battle below takes the opportunity and releases an arrow at you. The arrow pierces through your jugular, and you bleed out in mere moments.\n",
  "page 200": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nHours go by before anyone comes to see you again, and even then it\u0027s only to give you food. A dish of berries and bread which you revel in eating. You never picked berries in this wood for fear they would be poisonous, so this meal is a nice change of pace. Well, at least it is for the first few days. \n\n\nThis is all that happens for the next several days. The faerie guards return with food, but that\u0027s it. No beatings, no trial, or even executions happen, and soon you\u0027re left wondering what will happen to you. What if they just forgot about you, and left you in here for the next couple of decades? \n\n\nThe thought is abhorrent. You start working out daily in order to keep your mind and body fit. Otherwise you would likely just waste away in this cell slowly growing weaker. That\u0027s what they want, you tell yourself. They want prisoners to get weak so they no longer pose a threat anymore. You wonder briefly how long the other prisoners have been stuck in here, but you choose not to dwell on that thought. Better if you didn\u0027t know. \n\n\nThis cycle continues, and the only thing that differs is that every time the guards come, you shout at them. You request to have a fair trial, to have an audience with the king. Otherwise their laws were unjust! Of course, you don\u0027t really know if they cared about justice in the first place, but that isn\u0027t going to stop you from trying to convince them.\n\n\nEventually something changes, for one day a pair of guards walk into your cell, bind you, and lead you back out into the city. It is daytime, and the sun shines brightly overhead. The branches of the great tree in the center block most of the sunlight from breaking through, but not enough to dull its active effect on the city. The city is busy. Faerie people wander about doing their normal business, and when you pass by, they stop and gawk at you. They must not have seen a human before.\n\n\nThe thing that most surprises you, however, is the fact that the guards don\u0027t harass you. Guards back in your home, including you, would occasionally rough up the prisoner as they were escorted places. These guards don\u0027t touch you, and you manage to walk with a little bounce in your step. Despite being bound, you find yourself filled with anticipation and a sense of victory. You managed to get out of the jail cells, and for no reason that you can understand at that. You don\u0027t want to question it, but you can\u0027t help but feel wary as they lead you directly to the great tree. \n\n\nAs you approach you see roots of the tree being incorporated into every day tasks. One has been hollowed out, and is being used as a school room. Another has been meticulously carved until it formed the shape of a low-crouching panther. Faerie children play around the massive structure, and their childish laughter filters throughout the air. Another collection of roots were carved into stairs right in front of the great tree. The guards lead you onto these stairs now, and after an agonizing minute of walking up the stairs, you stand in the entrance to the great tree. \n\n\nYour assessment when you first saw the tree was correct. It was hollowed out, but only after a fashion. Above  you there was a ceiling, yet it was barely more than fifty feet high. The tree itself was much much larger than that. you guess that the tree was hollowed out at intervals, so that every part of it could be used to its max. You turn your eyes away from the ceiling, and to the massive first floor chamber around you.\n\n\nThe chamber is quite the grandiose of places. No castle you\u0027ve ever been in measures up to the level of beauty, time, and effort that you think must\u0027ve gone into this place. It is mostly void of furniture save for the magnificent throne on the other side of the room. The architects must have had the throne in mind when this was created, for the throne isn\u0027t just another piece of furniture. Rather, it is carved from the very beginning from the tree, and is still attached to it. \n\n\nThere are people milling all around, (noble blood you guess) but when you walk into the room everyone goes quiet. The pair of guards walk you directly up to the throne, and, upon arriving before it, they kneel. You don\u0027t, and instead look the figure on the throne in the eyes. You would not be intimidated.\n\n\nA golden crown encrusted with emeralds sits atop the figures silvery blonde hair. A cold, cruel smile sits on his chiseled face. Green, emerald eyes stare at you with a mix of surprise and disdain. Matching his cruel eyes is a pendant of emerald. It circles around his neck and lies upon his chest in a glimmer of dark green. In his left hand is a wooden sword, and despite it being wooden it\u0027s been sharpened to a fine point. He doesn\u0027t hold it like a regular sword, and you get the impression that it is ornamental. For some odd reason, you find yourself thinking you\u0027ve seen him someplace before, but you dismiss the thought quickly. You\u0027re certain the only faerie you\u0027ve ever seen was Liliana.\n\n\nThe, at least you assume so, king stands from his throne of wood and stalks over to you. He stands a couple of inches taller than you, and his chest is a little more broad than your own despite him being faerie. He looks you over. His gaze lingers on your left hand, but ultimately ends on your face. A smirk makes its home on his darkly handsome face. \n\n\n\"I see it\u0027s true then? You do possess the ring,\" he speaks softly. \n\n\nYou look down at your hand, and your heart drops. They knew exactly who you must be, and you don\u0027t know the exact customs of this people, but you\u0027re sure they don\u0027t take kindly to some human wedding and bedding their princess.\n\n\nThe king walks continually closer to you until he stands right beside you. From there he leans in and whispers in your ear. You take notice that he holds his pendant as he speaks. \"You\u0027ve traveled a long way from home human, and to what avail? Liliana is mine now, and she is happy here. You have no place here, and you\u0027re lucky you didn\u0027t get killed on sight.\"\n\n\nYou open your mouth to speak, but he continues. \"I am a benevolent king, however, so I will give you this one opportunity. Just this one opportunity. I will escort you through the forest, and all the way back to your own realm. You need not fear death with faerie escorts. You will be safe, and you should rest well knowing that your beloved,\" he spits the word out at you, \"is happy and safe with me.\" \n\n\nYou\u0027re about to tell him to go screw himself, when you see her. \n\n\nLuscious black hair falls down in waves around her face. Dazzling azure eyes look around the room curiously, and a small smile sits upon her face. A gown of white silk clings to her curves, and your mouth goes dry as she walks toward you. Liliana.\n\n\n\"Hello darling.\" She says as she approaches, and you open your mouth to respond, but the king does so first. \n\n\n\"Hello dearest,\" the king says as he wraps an arm around her waist. He holds her possessively, and your heart breaks.\n\n\n\"Who is this Torinal?\" Liliana, asks the king while pointing at you. \n\n\n\"No one of importance my love,\" Torinal looks at you with a grin on his face. It seems to say, \u0027I told you so.\u0027\n\n\n\"Now,\" he starts, \"have you thought about my offer?\" \n",
  "page 202": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nHis words echo in your mind, and your judgment becomes clouded. You know you should refuse his offer, but for some reason you don\u0027t want to. You find yourself thinking that this was, in fact, the best option. For a moment you think there is magic involved, but Torinal rubs his pendant and that thought disappears from you mind as well.\n\n\nFor the first time in your life, your heart breaks. You managed to maintain hope when your father tried to rape her, when she was captured, all the way up to this point. \n\n\nTears come to your eyes, and with a broken soul you accept his offer. What is the point of everything if Liliana doesn\u0027t want you anymore? You were such an insignificant person in her life that she can\u0027t even remember you, so why bother?\n\n\nTorinal grins, and he has his guards escort you from the tree. \n\n\n~\n\n\nYear 412 of the Second Era\n\n\nYour mind has lost its sharpness, and your body has lost its spring. You no longer work guard duty, but instead teach future guards the fine art of standing on a wall and staring around for hours on end. It isn\u0027t the most enjoyable job, but it is a necessary one. With the Four Realms in a state of war it was necessary for you to pass on your experience to the next generation. \n\n\nOftentimes you wish you were young again. That way you could help fight off the faerie threat to the south, or maybe the threat of mages to the east. Hell, you would even take fighting the giants of the north over teaching greenies the way of the sword.\n\n\nEach time ends with you grimacing and pushing the thought away. You were young once, and you managed to survive the Lost Realm! You\u0027ve had a decent life, and there is no point in throwing it away for some stale bit of glory. \n\n\nThere is one regret that haunts your dreams. The memory of a faerie beauty. One of dark hair, and soft lips, but you push that thought away too. Dwelling on the past isn\u0027t good for your health after all.\n",
  "page 201": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nHours go by before anyone comes to see you again, and even then it\u0027s only to give you food. A dish of berries and bread which you revel in eating. You never picked berries in this wood for fear they would be poisonous, so this meal is a nice change of pace. Well, at least it is for the first few days. \n\n\nThis is all that happens for the next several days. The faerie guards return with food, but that\u0027s it. No beatings, no trial, or even executions happen, and soon you\u0027re left wondering what will happen to you. What if they just forgot about you, and left you in here for the next couple of decades? \n\n\nThe thought is abhorrent. You start working out daily in order to keep your mind and body fit. Otherwise you would likely just waste away in this cell slowly growing weaker. That\u0027s what they want, you tell yourself. They want prisoners to get weak so they no longer pose a threat anymore. You wonder briefly how long the other prisoners have been stuck in here, but you choose not to dwell on that thought. Better if you didn\u0027t know. \n\n\nThis cycle continues, and the only thing that differs is that every time the guards come, you shout at them.

  "page 204": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n\"Torinal, you treasonous bastard, I demand you release me. My place here is not that of a prisoner, but that of your king.\" You say this loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear you, and for a moment everyone is silent. \n\n\nThen a chorus of laughter filters through the air, from everyone except Liliana and Torinal. \n\n\nTorinal\u0027s face is a mask of bewilderment. You see him start to hold his pendant, and you scoff silently to yourself. You posses a dagger that could hold off the fires of a muse. There was no way his petty charms would work on you.\n\n\n\"A human can\u0027t be our king!\" many of the people scoff. \n\n\n\"What do you know of lordship you human cur?\" another shouts at you. \n\n\nTorinal eyes you with wrathful eyes as many throw insults at you, but eventually he smiles. \"Whatever do you mean?\" \n\n\nHe thinks that he has you, but he doesn\u0027t know what you do. You know of his pendant, and exactly how he intended on seizing the throne. By your calculations, you still have at least a week before the marriage is supposed to take place. Liliana only acts the way she does because of that damned pendant. The being told you to kill him, but you don\u0027t think that would go over too well with the crowd, but if yyou could just find some way for him to take it off...\n\n\n\"I am the rightful king is what I mean,  oh traitorous Torinal.\" You hold your bound hands above your head for everyone to see. \"On my left hand is a ring. a ring that I got from Liliana herself when we married in the Realm of Men.\" \n\n\n\"Lies!\"\n\n\n\"Blasphemy!\"\n\n\nTorinal scoffs. \"That isn\u0027t Liliana-\"\n\n\nOne voice rises above them all, however, and this one sounds more confused than anything. \"Why do you have my ring?\" \n\n\nEveryone else goes silent as Liliana approaches you, and looks closely at the ring. She nods thoughtfully. \"Yes, this is my ring.\" She looks closely at your face, and you think you see a flicker of recognition enter her azure eyes. \" Do I know yo-\" she starts, but is interrupted by Torinal. \n\n\n\"Liliana!\" he shouts to get her attention. \"I need you to go to your room. I will be there in a moment.\" \n\n\nWhen she doesn\u0027t go immediately Torinal shouts, \"Now!\" and she obeys. \n\n\nUpon her leaving the room, Torinal addresses the crowd of faeries. \"This human is a fraud! I will not abide him ruining our peaceful land with lies and trickery.\"\n\n\nHe stalks up directly you and grins. \"But I am a benevolent king, am I not?\" The crowd agrees halfheartedly, but he doesn\u0027t notice. \"So I will give this naysayer a chance to prove his word with his blade.\" He walks directly up to you, takes off a gauntlet, and slaps your face with it. \"I challenge you to a duel. May the strong win, and the weak falter.\" \n\n\nYou hold back a smile. He walked right into your trap. \"I accept, you treasonous pig. I accept.\" To punctuate this, you spit directly onto his face. \n\n\nA look of pure rage passes over his face, but he manages to keep himself from striking you then and there. \"Bring out my armor, and bring some for the human cur as well.\" \n\n\nSeveral minutes pass before the armor is brought in, and with it a pair of hilt encrusted silver swords. \n\n\nGuards help fit you into their dueling armor, which consists of varying pieces of colored leather armor. Yours happens to be black , and Torinal\u0027s a deep green color. The same green that you found yourself hating all those weeks ago on the border wall. It\u0027s fitting that your enemy should wear such a color. \n\n\nWhen armored, you and Torinal grab your swords and ready yourselves. A circular area is marked in the center of the massive throne chamber, and the two of you enter into it. You don\u0027t have your shield, so you feel slightly off-balance, but you get over it. This isn\u0027t the time for you to be thinking of anything but the fight.\n\n\nYou take a deep breath and gaze across the ring to Torinal. He is poise incarnate, and you can tell he has a ton of experience fighting. This will be an uphill battle, but it is one that you intend to win.\n",
  "page 205": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThere is no way in all of the Four Realms that you would try to kill a muse. That would be asking to be damned in the hereafter.\n\n\nYou take one last look at the dark horse before heading off in the complete opposite direction. You have all of the information you need, so the only thing left is to act on it. You are this close to Liliana. You can feel it in your bones. \n\n\nAs you reach the edge of the clearing, you hear the tramping of feet behind you, but before you can turn around you feel the distinct feeling of a hoof against your groin. You immediately keel over on the ground in pain. You didn\u0027t even know the horse would turn hostile, let alone be able to kick with such precision. \n\n\nAfter a long moment, you try to get back up, but a hoof slams against your temple. You\u0027re sent back to the ground in pain, and this time the horse doesn\u0027t waste anytime in kicking you again. And again. And again, until you are reduced to a quivering heap on the ground. It is only then that the horse takes mercy on you and ends it all with another well placed kick to the head.\n",
  "page 33": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThere isn\u0027t anything left for you here but death. And you cannot die. Your goal is to save your beloved. Liliana. You don\u0027t have time to be caught up in border battles where death is a likely possibility. Your life is not your own anymore, for if you die, then Liliana will as well. \n\n\nWith most of division two destroyed and with what\u0027s left of division one, there is no one to see you leave. You jog along the ramparts, and away from the battle. You pass the signal fire you lit and head to the next watchtower over. They keep food and water storage in the towers, and if you were to have any hope of deserting and living then you would need supplies. You move quickly, and gather food, water, flint and steel, extra arrows, a shield and everything else you could possibly need. After gathering it all, you head to the very bottom of the stairwell and tower. A large iron gate-like door greets you. It is quite the durable piece, and nothing less than a battering ram would be able to break through it. Or perhaps a wyvern flying at breakneck speed... You push that foreboding thought from your head and walk through the iron doors. \n\n\nA slight breeze pushes against your face. You\u0027re far enough from the battle that you can only barely hear the roar of the wyverns fighting. you take a breath and look at your next destination. The green of the forest is all that will greet your eyes for an indeterminate amount of time in the future. This is the only way to go. The penalty for desertion is death, so there is no way you are going to stay here. Your only option is to move forward in your search for Liliana. \n\n\nYou take a deep breath, ready yourself mentally, then enter into the Lost Realm. You don\u0027t get very far in there, however, before you run into kobold reinforcements. They number over ten, and you are no god though you do manage to take a few out before succumbing to multiple stab wounds.\n",
  "page 208": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nA cool breeze dances in the night. It shuffles through your hair, and causes Liliana to curl up closer to you as you walk. \n\n\nDespite being cold, a smile is etched onto her mesmerizing face, and you can\u0027t help but smile as well. You were just married, so you think that happiness is a suitable emotion to have. \n\n\nYou lean down a plant a feathery kiss on her neck, and you hear her gasp lightly. Still, she slaps you lightly in chastisement. \"Wait until we get back home,\" she tells you with a slightly seductive voice. \n\n\nYou plant another kiss on her neck before responding, \"What if I can\u0027t wait that long?\" \n\n\nShe stops walking, and looks you deep into your eyes. Her lips part, and she leans very closely in to you, but not quite close enough to be kissing. \"Wait anyway,\" she tells you with a smile spread across her face. She then plants a quick kiss on your lips before walking ahead of you. \n\n\nYou stand still for a moment, and wonder how in the Four Realms were you lucky enough to have such an amazing woman as your wife. You watch her as she continues walking, and as she turns around and gives you a coy wink. Your heart skips a beat and you follow after her. \n\n\nThe pair of you walk down a cobblestone street with many alleys, and as Liliana passes one of these alleys you see a person in a dark cloak reach out and pull her into the alley. \n\n\n\"Liliana!\" you shout and immediately set out after her. You get to the alley, and find the dark figure stuffing a piece of cloth in Liliana\u0027s mouth. You charge forward and attempt to tackle the assailant, but he, still holding Liliana, nimbly dodges out of the way. \n\n\nYou barrel past, but change direction soon after. The assailant shoves Liliana to the ground, then turns back to you. You approach slowly this time, and throw a right cross at his face. He dodges nimbly to the side, slams one of his gloved fists into your right arm, then plants a foot in your stomach. You are sent sprawling, but the pain isn\u0027t too great, so you\u0027re easily able to get back up.\n\n\nWhen you do, you see a gagged Liliana trying to hit the assailant in the back, but the assailant notices this and sends a well placed punch into her stomach. Liliana crumples to the floor, and you rush him once more. This time he doesn\u0027t dodge, and instead sends one of his knees flying into your stomach. You crumple to the cobblestone ground as well. \n\n\nYou struggle to get back up, but you do manage to lift your head in time to see the assailant grab Liliana by the hair and lift her to her feet. With a pained grunt and a shout you place your hands on the ground beside you and start to lift yourself up. The assailant kicks you in the side of your head, and you are sent back to the ground. \n\n\nYou lie on the ground dazed, but a voice breaks you out of your reverie. \"I\u0027m lost! I\u0027m lost! I\u0027m-\" she\u0027s interrupted before she can finish shouting it for the third time. You look up to see an unconscious Liliana in the assailant\u0027s arms. He, for the assailant is a man, turns back toward you to make sure you don\u0027t follow after him.\n\n\nIt is in that last look, that you manage to get a glimpse of his face. He has cold, handsome features, with silvery blonde hair, and cruel green eyes. You think this is the first time you started to dislike the color green. You memorize what you can of that face, and you swear a solemn oath to find this man, and make him pay for taking Liliana from you. Then, the pain becomes too great, and you pass out.\n",
  "page 32": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou aren\u0027t going to flatter yourself. You firing a few arrows into the kobold horde below won\u0027t change anything, except perhaps where you die. Fighting on the forefront of the battle won\u0027t change anything either, and will almost definitely lead to your gruesome death. No, you aren\u0027t that powerful of an individual. \n\n\nThere is only one thing left. If you can manage to hit even just one of your shots on one of the kobold riders, then you could very well change the course of this battle. Killing a few kobold on the ground won\u0027t make that much of a difference, but if you can manage to help take down the wyverns, then the griffin knights will be free to help division one on the ground. At this point, victory relies on those knights. You only hope that you can help expedite that process.\n\n\nYou find a bow lying among the dead on the ramparts, along with a few arrows. The only thing left to decide is what you will aim at.  \n",
  "page 207": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou have sorely miscalculated. If you are a bear, then Torinal is a dragon, If you are a prince, then he is a king. You are sorely and severely outclassed.\n\n\nThe duel starts out fine enough. You exchange quick blows in an attempt to grasp at his weaknesses, but you find none. He, however, finds a ton. He starts attacking at your left side, because he\u0027s noticed you can\u0027t block very well there. He also notices that you are slow to dodge thrusts, and therefore does those with increasing frequency. \n\n\nYou try attacking him with a series of ferocious feints, but he predicts every attack. You try to go on the defensive, so that he runs out of energy, but he seems to have infinite reserves of it. Attack after attack comes your way, and soon enough you no longer have time to attack. You are left having to defend, or end up dying. \n\n\nThe sound of metal clashing fills the room, and the spectators cheer and shout with every good move Torinal makes, and laugh and jeer at every bad move you make. \n\n\nYou know it is only a matter of time before Torinal deals a finishing blow, and you only have energy for one last rush. You take a breath between hits, and rush him ferociously. You change the pace of the battle, and soon your positions swap. You on the offensive, and him being pressed back, yet none of your attacks manage to land a single hit on him. Each one is deflected with the skill and deftness of a fledgling god. \n\n\nEventually you tire even more, and you leave an opening for Torinal to act upon. He parries your blade, then plants a foot into your side. You are sent sprawling. You plant a knee on the wooden floor to get back up, and then a foot, but Torinal kicks you back to the floor. He\u0027s toying with you at this point. \n\n\nYour hopes of victory cease to dwell within you, and at one point you don\u0027t even attempt to stand back up. Instead you kneel on both of your knees before him. You are too tired to stand. Too tired to even lift your sword, which promptly drops from your right hand and onto the floor beside you. \n\n\nRegret fills your eyes as Torinal slowly stalks toward you. The crowd around you goes silent as Torinal raises his sword above his head, grips it with two hands, and swings at your head in a deadly arc. \n",

Better to aim at the riders, and have the wyverns panic with their riders dead. This would make the wyverns much easier to kill.\n\n\nIn theory.\n\n\nThe situation casts you into a state of wonderment. You never would have though that you\u0027d be in a battle this large, let alone one with aerial combat, and you don\u0027t want it all to end here. You take your first arrow, notch it, and pull it back. You wouldn\u0027t get many decent shots here, and when the opportunity arises, you don\u0027t want to miss it, so you wait. The kobold riders ride low in their saddles, for some among their numbers (including the one you killed) have felt the sting of mankind\u0027s arrows. This makes finding a decent shot all the more difficult, but you\u0027re patient. After all, you only need one good shot to turn the tide in this battle.\n\n\nYou\u0027re left waiting for nearly a full minute before such an opportunity arises, and what the opportunity it is. One of the griffin riders, having been separated from the rest, rides past the wall only several feet away from you. A wyvern and its pair of riders give chase, and their passing by the wall gives you the perfect chance. You take aim at the kobold rider steering the beast, and release. \n\n\nThe Muses must have seen it fit to bless you this day, for your arrow strikes true. it hits the kobold rider and it goes flying from the saddle. You\u0027re about to leap with joy when an arrow pierces you through the chest, and you immediately fall to the ramparts wounded. It isn\u0027t a shot that kills you immediately, but blood is pouring out of your chest at an alarming rate, so you know you\u0027re about to die. \n\n\nYou only wish you could\u0027ve seen Liliana one last time.\n",

No, if you\u0027re going to attempt to help the griffin knights, then the best way to do so is to take out a wyvern. Even if you only manage to take out one of them, it would help a significant amount. \n\n\nYou cast your thoughts back to your youth. Your mother would tell you stories of the beasts in the Lost Realm, and of the heroes whom bested those beasts. You\u0027re sure you remember something about a wyvern being vulnerable in its underbelly? Or maybe it was its wings? You can\u0027t remember for sure, but you don\u0027t have any other ideas. \n",

They don\u0027t need your \u0027support,\u0027 and they definitely don\u0027t need you shooting stray arrows and accidentally hitting one of them. Division one, however, does need your help, but leaving the wall at this point would be foolish. You\u0027d likely be an easy target for a kobold archer in the back. Instead you decide that your best option is to stay on the ramparts and pick your shots. \n\n\nThus, you act. You find a bow lying beside a dead body, along with a few arrows, and immediately set to work. You focus on the easy targets, the ones away from the forefront of the battle. Those, and the kobold archers. You loose arrow after arrow into the enemy force, and bring many a kobold down, but it simply isn\u0027t enough. Your contribution isn\u0027t enough to turn the tide of battle at all, but, unfortunately for you, it is enough to garner the attention of the kobold archers.

You can\u0027t contend with wyverns on an equal level, and firing a few arrows won\u0027t make any difference in the fight on the ground. No, if you\u0027re going to win this fight, then you need to go right into the thick of it. If you can manage to help division stay alive for even five minutes longer, then the chances of the griffin knights helping out are significantly higher. \n\n\nYou still have your sword strapped to your waist, and you don\u0027t usually carry a shield on you for guard duty, so you pick one up from the dead and strap it to your back. Following this you jog to the closest tower and go down the stairwell. Inside the tower it is eerily quiet compared to the roars and clangs of battle outside, and the sound of your steel boots hitting the stone stairs reverberates throughout. Moments later, you come to the bottom of the stairs. A large iron gate-like door greets you. It is quite the durable piece, and nothing less than a battering ram would be able to break through it. Or perhaps a wyvern flying at breakneck speed... You push that foreboding thought from your head and walk through the iron doors. \n\n\nWhat greets you outside is a scene of bloodshed and death. Division one has been pushed back nearly all the way to the walls, but their line still holds. Currently the division is organized in a semi-circle formation with the flat of the circle pressed against the wall. Everywhere else is a place for fighting, and nearly every soldier fights for their lives. There is one soldier, however, that does not fight, You see him sitting against the wall with the shaft of a crude arrow of kobold make protruding from his stomach. It\u0027s Byron, and it looks like he\u0027s lost a lot of blood. \n\n\nAlmost instinctively, you approach him. As you near, a spurt of blood comes out of his mouth and splatter against your chest-piece. \"Lieutenant Byron?\" You ask this fairly loudly, but he doesn\u0027t respond, so you repeat it. \"Lieutenant Byron?\"\n\n\nThis time he turns his pain and regret filled eyes toward you. He focuses on you and reaches his arm up and grips your forearm in his. A sign of comradery and trust. \"I know not who you are, nor from where you came, but I need you now soldier. We are losing. My men die at every turn, and the kobold do not let up. Even still, there is hope. If we can keep the line, then they,\" he looks up to the sky, \"will save us.\"\n\n\nHe coughs up some more blood, but his grip on your arm stays strong. \"Your name escapes me soldier, and I feel bad for laying this burden upon you, but someone must keep these soldier together. Will you do this for me brother? See to it that some of these men survive this battle.\" \n\n\nWith this last request his grip loosens and falls limp at his side. His breaths cease, and you\u0027re left in the presence of a dead man. Numbly, you stand back up and gaze at the fight. You knew you needed to help in this battle in the first place, but speaking with Byron has strengthened your resolve. The only thing left to decide is where you will help.\n",

The left one. \n\n\nThe fighting over here doesn\u0027t seem nearly as intense as the fighting near the middle. You pull out your sword and shield, and immediately get to work. Most of the people fighting are beginning to get tired, so the addition of a fresh, well equipped soldier vastly improves the line. So much, in fact, that it seems that the entirety of the left flank almost molds around your fighting. Which strikes you as odd, because of the way you\u0027re fighting. You don\u0027t rush in and throw yourself at the enemy in a fit of battlefield rage, or anything of that sort. No, you\u0027re calm in the heat of battle. You have a focused determination, and because of this you don\u0027t make any brash moves. Your goal is to stay alive while keeping everyone else alive as well.

Your line was doing so well, and retreating now would be suicide. The kobold would have a field day with chasing down and killing everyone on the ground. It was a cowardly, foolish mistake. Hopefully no one would listen to the fool\u0027s order, but, to your chagrin, they do. Soldiers from your left and right start disappearing, and, soon enough,  there is no longer even the semblance of a line.

After your pivotal role in the battle, you\u0027re left among the living to help search the corpses of the fallen. The typical after battle duties: Kill any remaining enemies, help the wounded, and collect the bodies. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t the most glamorous job, but it sure beats fighting to stay alive. More than half of division one was killed, as was most of division two. Lieutenant Byron was included in this number.  Half of the adventuring group that the kobold were chasing in the first place, was killed, and those whom survived stayed behind to help with the gathering of the bodies. They, however, claimed the right to the bodies of their fallen comrades, and you were supposed to notify them should you find any of them. \n\n\nYou remember this when you find one of their fallen comrades. It\u0027s a man in silver plate armor with a massive double bladed battleaxe on the ground by his side. At first it doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s sustained any wounds, but, upon closer inspection, you see that his throat was cut and in a crude manner at that. You\u0027re about to call out for the group, but just as you open your mouth, a glimmer of shining red catches your eye. You close your mouth, and a sense of morbid curiosity overcomes you. The shining red light is coming from inside the folds of the fallen man\u0027s armor, and it isn\u0027t the distinctive crimson color of red. You take a quick glance around to make sure no one is watching, then reach down and stick your hand through the gaps of the man\u0027s armor. Your hand closes around a cold object, and you pull it free. \n\n\nA mesmerizing red object greets your vision. A ruby, about the size of your palm, sits in your hand. This kind of gem is wildly rare, and would likely buy you a fortune if you were to sell it. You see a brief vision of you with Liliana, not living in some rundown house, and instead living with land of your own and plenty of inheritance for your eventual children. You nearly take it then, but a thought stops you. A guy like this wouldn\u0027t just keep something this valuable on his person. No, he would\u0027ve already sold it. This gem was likely the result of his group\u0027s recent excursion into the forest. It might even be, just maybe, the reason the kobold were after these people so ferociously. If you were to take it now, and then enter the Lost Realm, well, you guess kobold would be hunting you to the ends of the realm. \n\n\nStill, it does look quite valuable.\n",

  "page 47": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nByron wishes for you to hold the line, and you will do just that. From what you can see, the kobold horde seems to be directing the majority of their forces toward the center and front of division one\u0027s formation. Thus, it should be the portion of division one\u0027s line under the most stress, and if that much is true, then the center is where you\u0027ll go. \n\n\nYou wade your way through division one\u0027s dead and living until you arrive just behind division one\u0027s line. What you see there is a sight to behold. Five humans hold back the kobold line. Sure, there are division one soldiers on either side of them, but the center, the very keystone of the line is centered upon these five people. None of them wear division one uniforms, yet every one fights at least as well, if not, better than any soldier you\u0027ve ever seen. The center of the five is a monster of a man. He stands at least a couple of inches taller than you, and is covered from head to toe in silver plated armor. A double sided battleaxe is all he wields, and he wields the weapon with deadly precision. The other four center around this guy. A man wielding a halberd stands directly to the left of the silver plated male, and a dual dagger wielding woman, at least a few years older than you, stands to his right. To the halberd guy\u0027s left is a, and oddly enough, slightly overweight guy wielding a mace and a small shield. He adorns just brown leather armor, and reminds you slightly of a monk. To the woman\u0027s right stands another guy. He wields a great sword, and is covered in almost as much armor as the man at the center.\n\n\nThese five fight with a ferocity akin to the wyverns flying above you. Every minute they stand is another minute the griffin riders have to kill the wyverns. These five are the crux of this battle, and it is through them that this battle has even lasted this long in the first place. \n\n\nThat\u0027s why it hurts even more when the man at the very center goes down. It happens very quickly. The kobold must\u0027ve realized the pivotal role this man played on the battlefield, for they took desperate measures to kill this man. Most of the giant lizards the kobold rode here on died in the initial clash, but it seems that at least one survived. The kobold cleared a path directly to the man, and sent a giant lizard with a single kobold rider barreling down that path to the plated warrior. When the lizard neared, it leaped into the air and threw itself at the warrior. All who were there watched with despair as the warrior attempted to catch the beast, but failed. The kobold immediately leaped off the lizard and slit the throat of the silver-plated warrior. \n\n\nBoth the lizard and the rider are then promptly killed by the halberd wielding man. A feeling of despair descends upon everyone at the line, and the dagger wielding woman and the man with the halberd exchange a knowing glance. You happen to catch this glance, and moments before they do it, you know exactly what they plan to do. You can tell from the tired and sad look on the halberd man\u0027s face. He\u0027s lost his will to fight, and will likely call for a retreat. \n\n\nIt would be a suicidal move. Only the fastest people would make it back to the line. Everyone else would be slaughtered by these kobold. After the death of their friend, these four intend to abandon everyone else. You have a split second to make a decision before they call a retreat.\n",
  "page 40": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n Maybe you\u0027re certain that wyverns are weak in the stomach, or maybe it\u0027s just a wild guess. Whatever the reason, you decide to try hitting the wyverns\u0027 stomach. \n\n\nSweat forms on your brow as you notch an arrow and take aim. You raise your bow at the wyvern closest to you, whom is being chased by a pair of griffin knights, and loose your arrow. Your aim is true, but the arrow merely glances off the strong hide. Apparently your hunch was wrong. The stomach is not a weak point for a wyvern. This fact, however, doesn\u0027t keep you from trying.\n\n\nYou enter a state of pure focus. Arrow after arrow is loosed from your bow, and when you run out of arrows you search for more. You will kill one of these blasted beasts even if it takes every arrow in this realm, this wyvern will fall. Fortunately for you, you don\u0027t have to wait too long before one of your arrows finds a weak point in the wyverns scales. The wyvern roars in pain, and for a moment you think you\u0027ve succeeded, but the wyvern keeps flying. \n\n\nThere is one thing that changes, however, and that is that the wyvern now targets you. Apparently it didn\u0027t appreciate your lucky shot. The griffin knights are not quick enough to save you this time, and you end up learning how sharp a wyvern\u0027s teeth are firsthand.\n",
  "page 42": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYour heart pounds, and your thoughts are a mix of old memories, new hopes, and an instinctive need to survive. You go through these thoughts at an insane rate searching, hoping to remember how wyverns were slain in the stories. You do remember something about a wyvern\u0027s stomach, and even about its wings, but there was one more thing. One more important detail that you\u0027re missing. It doesn\u0027t magically appear in your head, and you find yourself standing in a single place doing nothing for much longer than you should be. Standing there and hoping you remember won\u0027t achieve anything, so you resolve to take a few shots at the wyvern and hope for the best. \n\n\nYou raise your newly acquired bow, notch an arrow, and loose it at the wyvern closest to you. Your aim is true, and the arrow does hit the wyvern\u0027s stomach, but it bounces off harmlessly. Maybe the rage and frenzy of battle is getting to you, for, and almost involuntarily, you start humming. It is a vaguely familiar tune, but you can\u0027t think of the words that go with the tune, so you resume the task at hand. \n\n\nYou notch, aim, and loose your arrow at your next target. The wings. Despite your great aim, the arrow is merely gusted away by the drafts of wind created by the wyvern\u0027s flapping wings. You continue humming that nameless tune, for the strange familiarity of it clears your mind and helps you focus. \n\n\nYou notch another arrow, but you hesitate when you aim it. You\u0027ve already tried your two best guesses, so what else is there to do? Your first arrow glanced harmlessly off its tough hide, and your other arrow was blown away...\n\n\nArrows glance off\n\n\nLike water on rock.\n\n\nThe wings are soft\n\n\nso arrows flock.\n\n\nTheir hide is as stone\n\n\nbut it can still be smote.\n\n\nTo kill the beast alone\n\n\naim for the throat.\n\n\nSuddenly the words to that nameless tune come rushing back into your head. This was the thought that stayed at the edge of your mind. The song was a tune to help soldiers remember how to kill wyverns. With newfound hope, you take aim once more. You loose an arrow at the wyvern, but it sails just under its throat. If only it were as large as its belly or wings, you think as you ready another shot.\n\n\nYou fire again, and miss. And again, yet still miss. You manage to miss four more times before the wyvern and its rider take notice, and when the rider realizes what you\u0027re doing, it immediately steers its wyvern toward you. The kobold must be aware of their beasts\u0027 weak points to think of you as more of a threat than a griffin knight. \n\n\nSeveral hundred pounds of death soars through the air toward you, and you realize that you only have time for one more shot. After that you would likely be brutally killed by the wyvern and/or its rider. Time seems to slow down as you notch this last arrow, and take aim. You\u0027re able to pick up on the smallest of details. Like how there are two griffin riders giving chase to the wyvern coming at you, and also that they won\u0027t be nearly fast enough to save you from the clutches of the enemy once more.\n\n\nEverything depends on this shot. The lives of both division one and two, and even perhaps the lives of the griffin knights. Your own life as well, and, by proxy, Liliana\u0027s. \n\n\nWith that encouraging thought in mind, you take a deep breath and loose the arrow. You don\u0027t even have enough time to see if you hit your mark before you are forced to leap to the side to avoid the wyvern. A massive crash sounds throughout the battlefield immediately following your successful evasion of death, and you turn to the origin of the crash, which, to your excitement and fear, is right beside you. For a moment you think the creature actually landed on top of the wall, but, upon closer inspection, it actually just crashed into the top of the structure. You aren\u0027t an expert on wyverns, but you suspect that this one is, in fact and in truth, dead. You hit your mark.\n\n\nA breath of relief escapes your lips, and you walk over to the corpse of the beast. Its grey scales no longer look menacing, and its once powerful wings don\u0027t give flight any longer. You leap on top of dead wyvern, and find the kobold rider still strapped into the saddle. It struggles to free itself from its self imposed bonds, and it struggles even more when the scaly fiend sees you, but it has no chance. You unceremoniously draw your sword an decapitate it. Crimson blood spurts from the crater created thereof, and your face is dowsed in the blood of your enemy. \n\n\nIt is then that you hear cheers go up from division one, and the remnants of division two. You turn around slowly to face them, and they see your blood covered body and cheer even louder. The blood is a sign of victory to them, and a sign of terror to the remainder of the kobold horde. Inspiration for your comrades, and fear in the hearts of the enemies. This is what turns the tide of the battle. Not you managing to take down one wyvern ( but that certainly helps), rather, it was the will to win and the desire for survival. \n\n\nThe remnant of division two joins division one on the ground and together the divisions rally. The kobold line breaks and your comrades continue pushing them until the kobold horde shifts into full retreat. The griffin knights, whilst this was happening, took advantage of their superior numbers, and managed to slay two more of the wyverns. The remaining two retreat back over the forest whence they came. \n\n\nThe battle is won.\n",

You raise your bow at the wyvern closest to you, whom is being chased by a pair of griffin knights, and loose your arrow.

You let your arrow go just before the wyvern flaps his wings, and it sails true piercing the softer scales of the wing. The wyvern roars in pain, and for a moment you think you\u0027ve succeeded, but you only hit one arrow, and that wyvern\u0027s wings are quite large.\n\n\nThere is one thing that changes, however, and that is that the wyvern now targets you. Apparently it didn\u0027t appreciate your lucky shot. The griffin knights are not quick enough to save you this time, and you end up learning how sharp a wyvern\u0027s teeth are firsthand.\n",

Your eyes are closed as you await your death. \n\n\nI\u0027m lost. \n\n\nThe thought enters your mind, and, almost forcibly, sends your body into action. You have to save Liliana. There\u0027s simply nothing else. You cannot fail her. You will not fail her.\n\n\nYou open your eyes. The five remaining kobold were just about to fill your body with their cold, sharp iron, but you roll out of the way just in time. Following this, you raise your shield, and shout, \"Liliana!\" \n\n\nYou don\u0027t know why you shout this particularly, but it seems to explain what you are feeling pretty well. That, and it confuses the hell out of the kobold. \n\n\nYou then, channeling all of your determination and willpower, charge the kobold. The lot of them shriek and surge forward as you do this, but they don\u0027t surround you. Rather, they stand in a line as they run at you. This makes it easy for you. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t hesitate and run directly for the middle kobold and thrust your sword through its chest. You don\u0027t stop there, but heave the body of the kobold up and onto your sword. You continue charging past the rest of the kobold as this happens, but they aren\u0027t quick enough to strike you as you pass. \n\n\nYou lower your sword and the kobold\u0027s small body (relative to your human frame) falls limply to the ground. You then turn around and face the four kobold left. \n\n\nThey advance toward you more cautiously now. Their eyes dart to one another as they wonder who will make the first move, but you don\u0027t let them think for long. You won\u0027t allow for them to fight on their terms. That would get you killed. Instead you rush the kobold closest to your left. It immediately goes on edge as it awaits a strike from your sword, but such a strike never comes. You crash into the kobold with your shield sending it sprawling, then immediately turn to face the next kobold. \n\n\nIt holds a spear, and stabs quickly at you. Never aiming for the same spot twice in a row, the kobold is quite effective in using its offense to wait for its allies to stand beside it. However, it lunges with its spear one too many times, and just a moment before its kobold friends would\u0027ve arrived, you grab the haft of its spear and pull it forward. This sets the kobold off balance, and you immediately thrust your sword through its body and into its heart. \n\n\nThe other two kobold are immediately upon you, and hammer you with a quick succession of attacks from their crude kobold swords. you barely block each attack in turn, and the pair of them manage to push you back significantly. The kobold you bashed into the ground stands back up and re-joins the melee. \n\n\nYour body begins to tire, but your determination never wavers. You block attack after attack from the kobold. Never getting hit, but never striking them either. Eventually, however, one of them extends their sword at you just a little too far with just a little less form than they aught to, and you quickly parry the attack with your shield, then slice them from their heart to their waist. The cut is relatively shallow, but it sends to kobold backwards over a dead body. You have about ten seconds left until that kobold gets back up to fight again, so you use them carefully. \n\n\nYou use the first three seconds to create a series of feints at the kobold on your right while blocking a thrust from a sword to your left.\n\n\nIn the next three seconds, you manage to feint the kobold on your right out, slash its throat, and block another attack from the other kobold. \n\n\nYou spend the last four seconds delivering an onslaught of strikes and thrusts at the last standing kobold. It doesn\u0027t last for long, and you finally manage to deliver a devastating strike to its neck freeing its head from its shoulders. \n\n\nThe ten seconds are up  and you turn to face the last kobold, but it isn\u0027t there. Or rather, it isn\u0027t standing. You miscalculated on one thing, and that was how long it would take for it to get back up. It lies on its back struggling to do so when you walk over. Quickly, and without remorse, you thrust downward through the kobold\u0027s chest. \n\n\nBlood spurts out staining your face, but you don\u0027t flinch away. It is a mark of victory. A mark of your strength and ability to stand straight among the likes of adventurers. Or at least it would if the other adventurers were still standing. \n\n\nYou struggle to your feet slowly, and ignore the fresh corpses of humans and kobold alike. You don\u0027t want to be reminded of the lives lost here. Especially of those lost because you wanted them to. No, you ignore those, and instead find the only thing that matters to you. \n\n\nThe ruby lies a few feet away from Flavius\u0027 corpse, and you pick it up and stuff it in your pocket. You look around for a horse to get out of this place, but apparently all of them were killed in the battle. You very dearly want to lay down and rest, but there would be more kobold coming here soon, and you don\u0027t want to be anywhere near here when that happens. \n\n\nWalking, you struggle through the forest the rest of that day and a little into that night.

You lean against one of the pillars, and wait.\n\n\nHours pass with you sitting there, and you doze off.\n\n\nWhen you come to, you hear singing and you are filled with a sudden need to find out where it is.

Either way, a healthy combatant should be able to handle themselves better than a wounded one.nbsp;\n\n\nYou sprint to Seram, and charge directly into one of the kobold with your shield. That kobold is sent sprawling, and before it can realize what is happening, you finish it with a quick stab from your sword. the other two kobold were startled by your appearance, and Seram manages to kill one as well. The last kobold attempts to escape, but you are quicker. You slash its leg first, then, when it falls on its knees, you behead the miserable thing. \n\n\nIt is right about then, however, that you hear the scream. You turn toward the sound of the voice, and a gruesome sight greets your eyes. Henrik\u0027s and Borra\u0027s heads stand on crude spears. The kobold by their dead bodies number five. They stand around your allies dead bodies, and gaze hungrily in your direction. Milling about behind them is the last of the five giant lizards.\n\n\nThey don\u0027t charge you. They sit their and wait. Tactics are unheard of among the majority of kobold, but these are not the majority. Their plan is simple. Provoke their enemies by desecrating their corpses. You aren\u0027t fazed by any of it,but the gore. \n\n\nSeram, however, falls right into it. Upon seeing his friends heads on spears, he surges forward with his great sword dragging along the ground beside him. Despite his wound, he charges at breakneck speed. His eyes cry for vengeance, but his body screams for mercy. He cannot fight them all and win. \n\n\nYou start after him, but you aren\u0027t able to catch him before he reaches them. The kobold dodge nimbly out of the reach of his great sword, but never attack. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t until you remember the giant lizard, that you see why. They surround and distract him so he won\u0027t see the beast coming, and their plan works terrifyingly well. When Seram is turned away from the lizard, they make their move. The giant lizard surges forward and tackles Seram\u0027s already weak body to the ground. One of the kobold immediately stabs his throat. Seram\u0027s grip on his sword slackens, and you are left alone surrounded by the enemy. You immediately lunge forward and stab the lizard through its throat. If you were to have any chance of surviving this, then that needed to be killed first. \n\n\nYou then leap atop the lizard\u0027s dying corpse and examine the field around you. Five kobold still remain. All of which stare at you with bloodthirsty eyes. \n\n\nThey rush you. One strikes at your legs, and another stabs at you with his spear. You somehow manage to block each of these attacks, but you deal out none of your own. You can\u0027t win if you can\u0027t attack. Slowly you start to lose energy until the fateful strike pushes against your shield with too much strength, and you are sent tumbling from the high ground. \n\n\nYou life flashes before your eyes, and regrets and doubts fill your mind. Even Henrik couldn\u0027t get up after being knocked down, so how could you? Your back lies against the ground and you close your eyes. You have accepted your fate...\n",
  "page 224": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n\"I\u0027m a slayer of kobold. The scaly beasts quiver in terror when I near, and plead for mercy when I draw my sword,\" you tell her as you puff out your chest a little bit. \n\n\n\"Kobold?\" the naked vixen asks unimpressed. \n\n\n\"Yes kobold. Have you ever seen one of the creatures before? A feisty lot they are...\" you then leap into an explanation of exactly how they are so deadly.\n\n\nEventually she tires of your speaking, and interrupts, \"If you really want to prove yourself a hero, then I have a worthy foe for you to combat.\" \n\n\nMaybe it\u0027s because you like a good challenge, or maybe the sight of a naked beauty, regardless of your marital status, sends your mind into a frenzy. Whatever the case, you find yourself wanting to please this woman. \n\n\n\"Bring the foe here, and I will slay it where it stands.\" \n\n\nThe flame haired woman grins mischievously. \"Oh, the beast isn\u0027t here. It\u0027s through there.\" She points behind you, and suddenly the massive doors from before stand in front of you. \n\n\nYou hesitate. There must be some serious magic going on here for her to be able to make doors appear out of nowhere like this. Still, if there is something in there that she needs you to kill, then why not oblige her whims?\n\n\n\"Sure. Just through here?\" you ask her as you place a single hand on the door.\n\n\nShe nods, and you take a deep breath before shoving the doors open. Despite their incredible size, they open fairly easily. You pull your sword and shield open, then step into the room. As soon as you pass the threshold of the doors, they close behind you. \n\n\nYou attempt to look around the room, but there are no torches to light it up. Well, at least there were no torches lit when you thought about it, but as soon as you wish for light there it is.\n\n\nSuddenly torches all across the room light up, and you see exactly the kind of situation you got yourself into. You stand in an absurdly large cavern. so large, in fact, that you can barely see the other side. in the middle of this cavern lies a gargantuan white dragon. Upon the room lighting up, the dragon opens it\u0027s eyes to see you. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t even have time to move before it blows a breath of frost toward you, and you are frozen solid.\n",

Seram, as bad as it sounds, isn\u0027t worth as much as an unharmed Borra right now.\n\n\nYou run after Borra, but before you catch up she charges directly into the band of kobold standing around Henrik\u0027s...body? You didn\u0027t see him when you first started running, but now you see him clearly. His body is motionless and deadly still whilst it lays upon the ground. You hope that, by some crazy miracle, he lives. Those hopes are dashed when one of the many kobold stabs its sword through his chest. \n\n\nBorra screams at the top of the lungs when she sees this, and, enraged, she charges the kobold that killed Henrik. With nothing left to do but help her, you follow. Borra kills that kobold, and, back to back, you two face the rest of the band. \n\n\nOut of the corner of your eye you see Seram\u0027s head separate from his shoulders, and the three kobold he was facing head toward you. \n\n\nSorely outnumbered and demoralized, you and Borra clash against the remaining kobold. The whole fight is a blur, and you react and act off of pure instinct. Two kobold go down by Borra, and one goes down by you. Five left. Three surround Borra, and she fends them off really well, but like you, she failes to remember that there is a giant lizard still roaming about. \n\n\nThat giant lizard charges her and sends her crashing to the ground. You realize what\u0027s about to happen, so act blindingly fast. You kill the kobold between you and Borra and rush toward her, but you are too late.\n\n\nOne of the kobold fighting her has already managed to stick its sword in her throat.

Well, those, and the massive tree in the center of the city. It rises well above any wall, and above any castle you\u0027ve seen back in your realm. Stone staircases weave their way in and around the tree, but those aren\u0027t the most notable things about it. It\u0027s the massive hole in the Center of the tree that takes the cake there. Even from where you stand, you can see that the tree was hollowed out, and, guessing from the location of the tree, you can only assume that\u0027s where the acting ruler lives.\n\n\nYour heart pounds in your chest as you take in the magnificent city. Anticipation shakes you to your core, as well as relief that you\u0027ve finally found the city. Deeper than these, however, is the feeling of fear: fear of the unknown, fear for Liliana, fear that she won\u0027t want to come back with you, and, muse forbid, fear that Liliana isn\u0027t even alive. \n\n\nThe last time you felt such emotion was a long time ago in a memory you often choose to forget...\n",
  "page 227": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThis is the reason you were sent here. This has to be, there is no doubt in your mind, Raynalixa. The muse of fire herself. Her beauty is definitely something to behold, but you are no lust filled beast. Your love for Liliana is much stronger than that, so you need to find some way to put your dagger in her.\n\n\n\"I am the greatest hero in all of the Lost Realm.\" A smile goes across her face, and you slowly start taking steps toward her. \"Wyvern, kobold, even faerie bow down to me. Otherworldly beings pay credence to me and come to me for favors.\" Another sentence and you will be right next to her. \"Above all of my other achievements, however, there is one that gives proof of my heroism more than any other.\" \n\n\nYou stop speaking, and the gorgeous muse stands transfixed awaiting your response. \"Oh?\" she prompts you to continue. \n\n\nYou stand directly in front of her, and say with a deadly smile, \"Slayer of muses.\" \n\n\nHer eyes widen, and fire immediately pours from her hand towards you, but the magic of the dagger repels it. You take that same dagger and, with a quick lunge, plunge it into her chest. \n\n\nShe screams, and golden blood pours from the wound. Her body starts convulsing and then disintegrates. The blood and the dust from her body absorb themselves into the dagger, which, curiously enough, turns red in color as if mimicking who it killed. You pick up this dagger, and then your vision goes black. \n\n\nWhen your vision returns you are back in the cave that the dark horse dropped you off at. The magnificent door is no longer at the end of the cave, but torches still line the walls. When you look to the opening of the cave, you see the horse waiting there for you.\n\n\nYou walk to it, and mount it. Your work here, while fairly gruesome, is done. There is know need for you to linger, not even the need for you to think about the atrocious act you just committed. The horse takes off, and at this point you\u0027ve become fairly used to its mind numbing speeds. After a while you reach the clearing where you consorted with the being. \n\n\nFrom there, you dismount the horse and face the direction the being told you that Arboribus was at. You look one last time at the horse, who bows its head to you, then head to your next destination.\n",
  "page 109": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou wake up from your sleeping when you feel something nudge your head. Reflexively, you reach up to push whatever it is away, but when you do, you don\u0027t feel anything. \n\n\nTired and confused, you sit up straight and open your eyes. \n\n\nA being of light greets them. That being takes the form of an alabaster horse. Its hide is blindingly white, and if its color wasn\u0027t enough, it also seems to give off light. It is like some magical being from the stories your mother read you as a kid, but you don\u0027t remember a story about a white horse at all. \n\n\nIt stands just a few feet in front of you, and looks at you expectantly. You reach out toward it, but before you can touch it, it darts away from you. You frown, stand up, and start to approach the white horse. However, when you do, it darts away every time you get close.\n\n\nSoon your fatigue leaves you and is replaced with frustration. You don\u0027t know why, but you very dearly want to catch this horse. You take off at a run towards the horse, and as you approach, it takes off at a run as well. You chase it through the forest, but the being is a horse, so you are soon left behind. You are still able to see the horse, but it is quite a distance away from you. Your run slows to a walk, and slowly you follow the horse. \n\n\nYou begin to get tired again, but whenever you think of stopping, the horse is close to you again, and your desire to catch the horse is strengthened. You sprint after it only for it to outrun you. This process continues for some time before something even stranger happens. \n\n\nWhen you and the white horse are as far apart as possible, another being appears before you. This one also takes the form of the horse, but unlike the other horse, this one is as dark as night itself. It is so dark, in fact, that you wonder how you\u0027re even able to see it at all. It glows darkly with an ethereal glow, and looks every bit as mesmerizing as the first horse. You change your direction, and begin to follow this horse instead. It is way closer than the other one. \n\n\nAs you do so, however, the white horse returns, and with a fury you\u0027ve never seen before from a horse. The white horse rears up and attempts to strike the dark horse with its hooves, but the dark horse darts away from the attack. It quickly returns with an attack of its own, and the battle is underway.\n\n\nYou stand off to the side, transfixed by the magnificent display of battle presented by these two. Eventually, however, that battle comes to a close with the dark horse as the victor. It strides confidently toward you and beckons for you to follow it. \n\n\nThe white horse limps away from the scene wounded. \n\n\nYou are torn. Both horses are very beautiful, but, to your chagrin, you can only follow one of them. \n",
  "page 54": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nBlood seeps through the chain armor you\u0027re wearing. It isn\u0027t your own, but it really makes wearing armor uncomfortable. After your pivotal role in the battle, you\u0027re left among the living to help search the corpses of the fallen. The typical after battle duties: Kill any remaining enemies, help the wounded, and collect the bodies. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t the most glamorous job, but it sure beats fighting to stay alive. More than half of division one was killed, as was most of division two. Lieutenant Byron was included in this number.  Half of the adventuring group that the kobold were chasing in the first place, was killed, and those whom survived stayed behind to help with the gathering of the bodies. They, however, claimed the right to the bodies of their fallen comrades, and you were supposed to notify them should you find any of them. \n\n\nYou remember this when you find one of their fallen comrades. It\u0027s a man in silver plate armor with a massive double bladed battleaxe on the ground by his side. At first it doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s sustained any wounds, but, upon closer inspection, you see that his throat was cut and in a crude manner at that. You\u0027re about to call out for the group, but just as you open your mouth, a glimmer of shining red catches your eye. You close your mouth, and a sense of morbid curiosity overcomes you. The shining red light is coming from inside the folds of the fallen man\u0027s armor, and it isn\u0027t the distinctive crimson color of red. You take a quick glance around to make sure no one is watching, then reach down and stick your hand through the gaps of the man\u0027s armor. Your hand closes around a cold object, and you pull it free. \n\n\nA mesmerizing red object greets your vision. A ruby, about the size of your palm, sits in your hand. This kind of gem is wildly rare, and would likely buy you a fortune if you were to sell it. You see a brief vision of you with Liliana, not living in some rundown house, and instead living with land of your own and plenty of inheritance for your eventual children. You nearly take it then, but a thought stops you. A guy like this wouldn\u0027t just keep something this valuable on his person. No, he would\u0027ve already sold it. This gem was likely the result of his group\u0027s recent excursion into the forest. It might even be, just maybe, the reason the kobold were after these people so ferociously. If you were to take it now, and then enter the Lost Realm, well, you guess kobold would be hunting you to the ends of the realm. \n\n\nStill, it does look quite valuable.\n",
  "page 57": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou take the gem and quickly pocket it. This gem could very well be the key to yours and Liliana\u0027s future after you rescue her. A life of luxury and money, along with your children\u0027s life being better than your own...this opportunity is too valuable to pass up. \n\n\nAfter taking it, you call out to one of the dead man\u0027s comrades and usher him over to the body. The man wields a halberd nearly twice the size of his body, and his demeanor is that of a serious one. the combination makes for quite the imposing figure. \n\n\n\"Thank you soldier.\" He nods once in your direction, then turns away from you. \n\n\nYou stay and watch as he starts to pick up the body of his comrade, and instinctively you move to the opposite side of the body and pick the dead man\u0027s feet up. The halberd guy nods again, and the pair of you pick the armor clad body up and move it away from the sea of corpses. After a short distance you put the body down, and then he walks a few paces over and sits on the grass. You think this a cue for you to leave, yet you also realize this is an opportunity for you to garner some more information about The Lost Realm. \n\n\nYou sit down right beside him, but he doesn\u0027t acknowledge your presence. You take a quick breath, then begin your questioning. \"The Lost Realm, huh?\" \n\n\nHe ignores you.\n\n\n\"I heard it takes an insane amount of skill and kno-\"\n\n\n\"Cut the crap. What do you want from me?\" He says this with the slightest edge of anger, but mostly he just sounds tired.\n\n\nYou nod. \"There\u0027s something I want in the Lost Realm.\" \n\n\nHe turns in your direction. \"There\u0027s nothing for you in that kobold infested forest. Only death.\" His tone is even, but his words speak only truth. \n\n\nYet, you cannot stop there. \"Specifically there\u0027s a place. Have you ever heard of a place called Arboribus?\" \n\n\nThis time he responds immediately. \"It doesn\u0027t exist.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not looking for confirmation of its existence I-\"\n\n\nHe interrupts you again. \"That place is a myth. There are no settlements of faeries in that godforsaken place. Like I said. Only death awaits you there.\" \n\n\n\"But you were just there.\" \n\n\nHe scoffs. \"And guess what awaited me when I got back? Death.\" \n\n\nWell that was depressing, and not very helpful. You stand up to leave, but he says one more thing to you. \"What\u0027s there for you in Arboribus?\" \n\n\nYou ponder his question for half a moment before responding with, \"My future.\" With that said, you leave. You have more bodies to pick up after all. \n\n\n~~~\n\n\nThe rest of the day passes monotonously. Especially when compared to the adrenaline inducing events the morning brought. Since the division was left without a leader and without numbers, the remaining griffin knights (only one was killed in the battle) stay to help guard the wall. You intended to talk to them today, maybe find out if there was some way for one of them to fly you into the forests of the Lost Realm, so you wouldn\u0027t have to deal with the kobold at the edge of the forest, but the chance never came. You also meant to talk to one of the others from that adventuring party, but the chance for that didn\u0027t come either. \n\n\nYou lie in your quarters that night restlessly. You don\u0027t sleep well ever since Liliana was abducted, and worse with every day that goes by that you aren\u0027t spending in pursuit of her. \n\n\nI\u0027ll leave soon. Regardless of everything else. With your resolve to enter the Lost Realm strengthened, you fall asleep.\n",
  "page 59": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nNormally you don\u0027t get a lot of sleep, but the battle must have tired you out significantly, for you sleep nearly the entire night without waking up. Nearly. That night still haunts your dreams and your very thoughts shy away from remembering it. It is the one memory that you must push away. \n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of silence. It circles around the men in the barracks, and lingers around the empty beds. You can feel the loss of every man in the battle like a weight on your back, and you\u0027re sure the rest of the men here feel the same. A man can\u0027t simply go through what you did, and not be affected. You pull yourself from your bed and get ready. There are people to talk to and decisions to make, and no time to waste in between. \n\n\nIn the short time you\u0027ve been at this wall, not many important things happened. Yesterday was the exception, and from it you learned three things.\n\n\nFirst: The forests of the Lost Realm, or at least the forest edge near the wall, are kobold infested.\n\n\nSecond: Despite the fact that kobold constantly roam the forest, the adventuring party managed to get and out of the forest. Not unscathed of course, but it is possible to do it. \n\n\nThird: It might seem an unimportant factor to most, but it could prove to be a pivotal factor in your survival. Griffins are faster than wyverns. That means that if you were to somehow manage to convince one of the griffin knights to fly you to the forest, then you could avoid many of the dangers that lurk in the Lost Realm. \n\n\nAfter today you will likely have all of the information you can get. Staying any longer would be pointless. \n\n\nSince this wall is short on soldiers, every guard is working double time to cover all of the shifts. Despite this, you do manage to find some pockets of time to go about your personal business. What do you use that time for?\n",

His three other companions follow suit, and the line\u0027s gap increases allowing for kobold to rush in and wreak havoc. Soldiers start dying left and right. There\u0027s no way to come back from this. The battle is lost.\n\n\nYou dash away from the line and bolt towards the iron doors at the bottom of the tower. The group of four are significantly ahead of you, and as you struggle to catch, up you trip over a corpse. You hit the ground hard, but immediately start to pick yourself back up. You are determined. You will survive this.\n\n\nUnfortunately for you, every other soldier is thinking the same thing, so as you\u0027re about to rise to your feet you are knocked back down by other retreating soldiers. You try again, but the same thing happens, and before you know it you are left behind. you try to play dead, but it is too late.

You raise your sword, and with a mighty cry shout, \"Forward!\" \n\n\nEveryone is taken aback. No one knows you, yet here you are. A nobody attempting to command this portion of the wall\u0027s forces. You inwardly scoff at yourself. Of course no one would listen to you. Perhaps the Muses really do love you, for mere seconds after you do this a wyvern plummets from the sky and into the back of the kobold horde. It was almost as if you synchronized your cry with the wyvern crashing, but you know that it was simply a stroke of luck. A beautiful stroke of luck. Division one hears your order and sees the wyvern fall from the sky, and a cheer goes up. All of this happens in the span of a few seconds, but after this the battle resumes. It\u0027s even more intense than before, but this time for a different reason. Division one\u0027s morale is boosted significantly and they can feel it. You can feel it as well. Whereas before defeat and death awaited you, now victory and survival is just at the edge of your reach. You need only take it. \n\n\nAnd so you do.\n\n\nLeading the center of the line, you slay kobold after kobold in a fit of masterful rage. The group of four from before is caught up in the feeling, and instead of retreating, they now fight right alongside you. Together you push back the line, and give the griffin knights even more time to finish their job.\n\n\nWhich they use eagerly. After just another minute another wyvern falls from the sky. Not on top of the kobold horde this time, but the effect is nearly the same. Division one sees the wyvern fall, and in return they smell victory. The battle continues, but not for much longer. With two wyverns slain, a griffin was freed up to attack the horde below, and that maneuver seals the deal. The kobold line breaks, and they are chased back to the forests of the Lost Realm. The remaining wyverns retreat as well. \n\n\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. The battle is won. \n",

  "page 67": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nWhat do you have to lose? Redmond already told you no, and what if this guy is of a different opinion? You could be on your way to Liliana at crazy speeds if only you could manage to convince this other knight to give you a lift. \n\n\nThus, with hope and confidence in your walk, you head over to the knight.\n\n\nHaving just landed, the knight is only now dismounting from the black and white griffin. Their back happens to be turned when you do this, so they don\u0027t see you for a solid minute or so as they retrieve their gear from the back of the griffin. It at least gives you time to examine it and its knight. The knight stands just a few inches shorter than you, but you\u0027d expect that. You are rather tall. It\u0027s his build that surprises you. He\u0027s a lot less broad than you would expect of a knight from so legendary an order, but you dismiss your expectations soon enough. If a man like Redmond deemed this knight worthy, then who are you to argue? \n\n\nThe griffin, however, is more than you hoped for. Easily double your height in length, the beast is quite large. It\u0027s wings are even larger, and its wingspan is simply massive. Now this was a majestic creature. Not anything like those wyverns from the fight yesterday. No, this was a beast of power and honor. Based upon its looks, you guess it could easily hold two people, and likely their armor as well. But could it carry any supplies you could possibly need...\n\n\n\"You!\" A shout breaks you from your examining of the griffin.\n\n\nA shout, as it turns out, from the knight himself. You move your gaze to the knight, who is now facing you, and respond, \"Me?\" \n\n\nThe knight, still fully armored, nods and starts speaking to you. His silver helmet muffles up most of what he says, but you do catch some words. Something about Bucky being a son of a bitch...? You can\u0027t make sense of most of what he\u0027s saying, so you decide to cut him off.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t understand what you\u0027re saying. Maybe take your helmet off?\" you suggest, and gesture with your hand with what you hope looks like an imitation of you taking off a helmet. \n\n\nHe must understand you, for he reaches up and takes his helmet off his head. \n\n\nDeep brown eyes greet your own, and long blonde hair cascades in tangles around her face. It is somewhat messed up from being cooped up in a helmet for half the day, but somehow still manages to look good. Her face is dirty as well, but not in an unkept way. In a hard work kind of way. A woman who doesn\u0027t mind getting her hands, and apparently face, dirty when necessary. And it is a woman. You were too caught up in your self created image of a griffin knight, someone like Redmond, to realize that it wasn\u0027t a man before you. \n\n\nNeedless to say, you are taken aback, so much, in fact, that you don\u0027t even hear the next words that she says. \n\n\nShe doesn\u0027t repeat them either. Instead she says, \"Yes I believe you are.\" She looks up and leans slightly closer to you, as if examining your face. She nods once more, then says. \"Mhm. It is you. I knew it.\" \n\n\nShe then, and unceremoniously so, kneels on one knee before you and bows her head. \"You, having saved mine and Adroxius\u0027 lives, have proven yourself worthy of our service. I pledge myself and Adroxius to you. We shall be in your service until I die, you die, or until we fulfill the debt we owe to you.\"  \n\n\nShe used the word we a lot, as if she spoke on behalf of the griffin as well. Speaking of the griffin, it must have been trained very well, for, upon seeing its rider kneel before you, it faces toward you and bows its head as well. \n\n\n\"Will you accept our service?\"\n",
  "page 69": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThis is that griffin knight. The one you saved in yesterday\u0027s battle. You knew that crazy, reckless plan was the right thing to do, and now it has given you more than just the opportunity to win a battle. It has given you the opportunity to save your beloved.\n\n\n\"Your service will be very much appreciated. Yes, I accept.\" \n\n\nFor the slightest moment you feel that leading this knight into one of the most dangerous places in the four realms for your own personal reasons might be a little...wrong, but then you remember Liliana\u0027s azure eyes, the feeling of her body curled up against yours, and the soft, caring sound of her voice, and you no longer feel guilty. \n\n\nThe female knight raises her head first, and then, with reverence, slowly rises to her feet. \n\n\n\"Very well master. What would you have me do?\" \n\n\nYou mentally grimace at her use of the word master, but it\u0027s a small price to pay in order to use this knight. You then go into an in depth explanation of why you want to venture into the Lost Realm, and what her place would be in such an endeavor, but when you begin to explain that she was to drop you off in the forest once you passed the borderlands, she argues.\n\n\n\"Forgive me, master, but it would go against my oath to leave you in that godforsaken place alone. I will continue with you the whole way, or we shall not use my griffin,\" she states.\n\n\n\"Aren\u0027t I the master here? Doesn\u0027t your oath require that you obey me?\" You hate to have to pull the master card so early, but it seemed necessary. \n\n\nThe knight disagrees again, \"No. My first duty is to protect you. Everything else comes secondary. Thus, me leaving you alone in there,\" she gestures loosely to the other side of the wall, \"would be more of a transgression than it would be to disobey you.\" \n\n\nYou eye her carefully. She has to look up to meet your eyes, and her chin is tilted slightly in obstinacy. A small vertical scar mars the right side of her jaw, and, for a moment, you get distracted by it. Enough, in fact, that on impulse you lift a hand to touch the side of her face. \n\n\n\"What happened here?\" She doesn\u0027t jerk away from your touch, but she doesn\u0027t react to it either. \n\n\n\"I\u0027d prefer not to say, master.\" \n\n\nYou nod, and your hand falls away from her face. \"Fine. You can accompany me the entire way. We leave at the end of the week.\" You think briefly about what Liliana will think of you saving her with a griffin knight, and then about what she\u0027ll think of you wandering through the Lost Realm at the side of some maiden. You dread that conversation. \n\n\n\"Master?\" The knight draws your attention back to her. A dimpled smile stretches across her face. \n\n\n\"Yes?\" \n\n\n\"Forgive me. I\u0027ve forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Emelyne.\" She extends her arm towards you, and you grasp your forearm with hers. \"Might I know yours? Or do you actually prefer me to call you master?\" \n\n\nYou shake your head. \"No I\u0027d prefer it if you call me by my name. Master seems too...laviscious.\" \n\n\nShe nods her agreement, then you tell her your name. After that, you two part ways, and decide to meet on the morrow. You two have a lot of things to get done if you want to leave by the end of the week.\n",
  "page 60": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nFor the first time that day your armored feet touch soft green grass. Because your duties as a wall guard you don\u0027t spend much time on the ground unless eating (the dining pavilion is just inside the wall) or fighting, as was the case yesterday. The excursion you\u0027re making right now happens to be an exception to that rule. \n\n\nOne of the griffin knights, a veteran by the name of Redmond, took the place of Byron as acting lieutenant, and has since been swamped planning transfers, promotions, and organizing guard schedules. During the day he works outside by the dining pavilion, and by night he works in Byron\u0027s old office. Rumors were that he used to be an adventurer himself before being offered a better life as a griffin knight. An adventurer that\u0027d traversed some of the expanses of the Lost Realm. \n\n\nYou find him in his typical spot. Under the pavilion tent with a meal of cheese and bread in one hand and papers in the other. A mug of ale sits on the table beside him. You made sure to approach him between meetings, and before the daily rush for luncheon. \n\n\nHis silver plated armor, he wears the set at all times it seemed, glitters from the sunlight, and makes it a chore for you to look at him. You decide to focus on his face. Several old scars mar it, and you guess that if he shaved his black beard you would find even more. He looks up as you approach, and greets you with a warm smile. \"What can I do for you soldier?\" \n\n\nYou settle into the bench seat opposite of him, and give him a muted smile. \"Sir, I come to you with two requests.\" \n\n\nHis eyes focus on yours, but he doesn\u0027t say a word. Instead he gestures for you to continue. \n\n\nYou hesitate for a moment wondering where you should start, but, as you think it over, there was only one real place to start here. You slide your wedding ring off of your finger and show it to him. \"This was my wife\u0027s ring...\"\n\n\nTruth is the best policy when dealing with your superiors, and so you start from the beginning and leave nothing out. How you married your wife, and how that same day she was taken away from you. You gloss some of the more gory details, and you also gloss over how you know she\u0027ll be in the Lost Realm, but you say enough. You\u0027re sure you got your point across to him. \n\n\nThere\u0027s a moment of silence after you finish explaining your situation, and Redmond sits still with a solemn look on his face. When he finally does speak, his voice is sad and full of regret. \"What are your two requests?\"\n\n\n\"I want to know about the Lost Realm, and how to survive in it.\" You see him wince slightly, so you add, \"Should I decide to go there.\"\n\n\n\"And the second?\" \n\n\nYou take a breath. The first request was simple enough, and Redmond seemed like the kind of guy that would give this kind of information away without too much trouble. The second request, on the other hand...\n\n\n\"With your leave, I would like to borrow a griffin.\" He immediately opens his mouth to interject, but you keep on speaking. \"I don\u0027t have to borrow one, but if there\u0027s any way possible for someone to fly me past the kobold infested edge of the forest, then I would be eternally grateful.\"\n\n\nYou look at him hopefully, but he\u0027s already shaking his head. \"Even if I could allow this, access to a griffin might just make you a bigger target. Then I would be sending you, and one of my knights to their grave. I\u0027m afraid I cannot allow it.\" \n\n\nYour heart sinks. You feel like Liliana is growing farther and farther from you with every passing moment. \n\n\n\"However, I can tell you some of what I know about the Lost Realm.\" You meet his eyes and nod gratefully. You\u0027ll take what you can get. \"This Arboribus place. I don\u0027t know where it is, but I do know who might. There is a being, deep in the Lost Realm, who knows everything there is to know about that realm. Or so it is said.\" \n\n\nYou listen curiously. \"Where is this person? If there\u0027s even the smallest chance of me finding my wife again, then I\u0027ll take it.\"\n\n\nRedmond nods and a slight glaze comes over his eyes. As if he isn\u0027t really looking at you anymore. \"Back in my adventuring days, I and my group had just finished scouring a kobold nest. Nasty buggers those are, and usually quite dumb as well, but in this particular nest, there was a shaman. She was a crafty creature, and as we were about to leave she placed a curse on all of us. It was quite the complex one, and I haven\u0027t seen any like it anywhere else in the world. And I\u0027ve been to the Realm of Magic, mind you,\" he says pointedly before continuing. \"The curse caused everyone in our party to disappear from one another\u0027s eyes. I couldn\u0027t see anyone in my party, nor could I hear them It was as if they disappeared. Frantically I searched the area, and eventually I found the shaman. She\u0027d used up all of her power casting the curse, so she was easy to kill.\"\n\n\nHe pauses and takes a quick swig of ale. \n\n\n\"But the curse didn\u0027t end when I killed her. It was an unnatural thing. Wicked in every meaning of the word. Now I wasn\u0027t very well versed in the forests of the realm, and before long I got lost in its vast depths. I do not know how long I wandered, but I slew many a kobold on my way, and managed to stay alive. On one particular night I leaned my back against a tree, and waited for sleep to overtake me. Before this happened, however, a glimmering white horse appeared before me. Not just any old white either. No, this horse was glowing! I was intrigued, as you can imagine I\u0027m sure, and, despite my fatigue, I stood up to pet the beast. Before I could, it trotted away from me. I tried yet again, but every time I drew near it would trot away from me. Several times I tried to quit following it, but every time I stopped the horse would appear again.\" \n\n\nHe pauses and eyes you. \"Are you still listening?\" \n",
  "page 62": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nYou\u0027ve learned all that you can, and with it you\u0027ve made a decision. You will not wait any longer to postpone your venture into the Lost Realm. On the morrow, you will begin your journey, but tonight you prepare. You stop at a watchtower on the way back. \n\n\nThey keep food and water storage in the towers, and if you were to have any hope of deserting and living then you would need supplies. You move quickly, and gather anything that you think might be useful: Food, water, flint and steel, extra arrows, a shield. Everything you could possibly need. After gathering it all, you put it in a pack and place it at the bottom of the tower. From there you head back to your barracks to get one last night of (attempted) rest. \n\n\n~~~\n\n\nMorning comes all too quickly, and you find yourself back at the bottom of the tower in no time. You grab your pack, take your last look around the tower, then face your exit.\n\n\nA large iron gate-like door greets you. It is quite the durable piece, and nothing less than a battering ram would be able to break through it. After you walk through these doors you will be considered a deserter, and there will be no turning back. With your thoughts centered on Liliana, you walk through the iron doors. \n\n\nA slight breeze pushes against your face.The green of the forest greets your eyes, and you can\u0027t help but feel a tinge of sadness at leaving your homeland. You start walking to the edge of the forest, and the active guards call out for you to stop, but you ignore them. They won\u0027t follow you into the forest, and you aren\u0027t going to stay. Your only option is to move forward in your search for Liliana. \n\n\nYou take a deep breath and take one last look at the wall.\n",
  "page 61": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe adventurers were recruited, through monetary means, to help guard the wall until a new transfer group came in. This makes is quite easy to find the adventurers, and two of them, the halberd wielding man you spoke with yesterday, and the slightly overweight guy with the mace, happen to be in the same guard shift as you. They stand beside each other, and gaze solemnly out into the depths of the forest. They are quite the picture of sadness as they stand there, and you start re-thinking your decision to pester them with questions. \n\n\nThey did just lose comrades in yesterday\u0027s battle.\n",
  "page 64": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\n\"Of course sir.\"\n\n\nA ghost of a smile passes over his face, and he continues his tale. \"Anyway, the horse would keep appearing before me, and eventually I decided it must be a dream, so I followed the horse. I thought I had nothing to lose, and, well, I didn\u0027t. Nothing, but time. I followed that horse for days on end. Through days, nights, and everything in between. The strange thing was that I wouldn\u0027t get hungry, nor thirsty. It was as if the horse itself was sustaining me. I don\u0027t know how long I followed it, but when I finally caught up to it we were in a cave. The cave wasn\u0027t the most impressive of places, but it was well hidden. If the horse hadn\u0027t led me there, then I\u0027m not sure I would\u0027ve found it otherwise. The horse continued its walking until we hit the end of the cave, and it was there, at the end of the cave that I saw it.\" \n\n\nHe pauses for a moment, and by this point you find yourself kind of invested in the story, so you say, \"Saw what?\" The curiosity in your voice is clear. \n\n\nRedmond grins. \"A magnificent door was before me. It was at least double my height high, and triple my width wide. It was golden in color, and had engravings of a ferocious beast, a dragon I believe, upon its front. In the very center of the door was a hole about yea large.\" He draws a circle in the air the size of his palm. \"When I was in front of the door, the horse disappeared and I was left alone in the cave. I tried to open the door many, many times, but it wouldn\u0027t budge. As far as I could tell, that hole in the center of the door, was a keyhole, and I didn\u0027t have the key. Thus, I was left alone there, but the cave was nice and it was good shelter , so I decided to wait the night there.\"\n\n\nA faraway look comes over Redmond\u0027s eyes. \"That night I heard the most beautiful sound. A voice singing, and just beyond the golden doors. Her voice was the most perfect thing I\u0027ve ever heard, and I began to be obsessed with the voice. I stayed in the cave for many more nights after that, attempting to find a way through the door, but I never could. Yet, even now, I can hear her voice singing that song.\" \n\n\nHe sighs, and you say, \"Wait, you still remember it?\" \n\n\nHe nods slowly, and he can tell what you\u0027re going to ask next, so he saves you the trouble. \"Now I\u0027m not much of a singer, but I can give it my best shot.\n\n\nHis voice is rather deep as he starts, and you find out he was being modest, for his voice is actually quite good.\n\n\n\"Queen of the lost\n\n\nlies in a cave.\n\n\nTrapped by the king of frost\n\n\nshe must be saved.\n\n\nA key of ruby unlocks the way\n\n\nand through golden doors\n\n\nyour muse awaits.\"\n\n\nHe finishes the short tune, and you quietly memorize it. Who knows? It might come in handy later, but your thoughts stay on the last line and you realize what it\u0027s saying. \n\n\n\"Wait, a muse?\" you nearly shout this question in surprise.\n\n\n\"Not so loud,\" he tells you as he looks around. \n\n\nA muse, you think in wonder. The muses were powerful beings of creation. They were said to preside over each of the four realms. One in each. Many of the religions of this era are based upon the muses in some way, shape, or form. If this really was a muse, then she\u0027d definitely know the way to Arboribus. This thought gives you hope, and you give Redmond one of your rare smiles. Rare since Liliana went missing, anyhow. \n\n\n\"Thank you sir.\" You reach across the table with your arm, and he meets you halfway with by clasping your forearm with his. \n\n\nHe pulls you a little closer and whispers in your ear, \"If you find that place, then you won\u0027t be able to get in. Find that key of ruby first. Otherwise you may never find your wife.\"\n\n\nHe lets go, and the two of you share one last look of understanding before you stand up and leave him. As you do this, however, a griffin mounted by its knight, soars just over the pavilion and lands not too far away. The griffin is a beautiful beast. Black feathers are spread across the majority of its body, with the sole exception of its head, which is alabaster white in color. Silver armor is fitted against its muscular body. (You guess they didn\u0027t wear armor during the battle because they were in such a rush to get here) Its rider is fitted in full silver plate armor. He cuts an imposing figure, and for a moment you feel slightly intimidated, but the feeling passes.\n\n\nYou turn to walk away, but you take one more glance at the rider and beast pairing. You are tempted to talk to them, if only to affirm what Redmond just told you about the freedom of griffin knights, but maybe, just maybe you could convince him to give you a lift right under Redmond\u0027s nose...\n",
  "page 63": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe first few days turn out fine, but as you go farther, you get more and more unsure of where you\u0027re going. During one particularly unlucky day, you accidentally wander into a kobold camp of at least thirty. \n\n\nThey first capture, then torture you, and after that\u0027s done, they feed you to their wyverns.\n",
  "page 220": "Year 378 of the Second Era\n\n\nThe owner of the voice is nowhere to be found, and you don\u0027t quite feel like waiting. Right is as good as any other direction, and so you pivot on your feet, and walk down the high ceilinged hallway. \n\n\nThe hallway doesn\u0027t turn or have any doors, so you continue onward in a straight line. The hallway doesn\u0027t change, but you do start hearing humming. It sounds like the perfect sounding voice from before, so you start walking in earnest.\n\n\nEventually, the hallway widens out into a large room. You hear the trickle of water and the soft splashes indicative of someone bathing. Normally you would leave a bathing person alone, but you have no idea where you are, and you are frankly in need of information.\n\n\nSteam filters throughout the air making it hard to see everything, but from what you can tell, the room is a series of large pools. The room is quite large, so it takes you a little while to get to the end of it, but when you do see it, you find yourself entranced by the scene before you. \n\n\nA woman, likely barely older than you, stands nude in the last pool at the end of the hall. You can\u0027t help but stare. Now there is gorgeous, and then there is this woman. every aspect of her breathes perfection: her body, her posture, and everything else you can think to look at. It is all there. Her hair is as fire. No halfway orange colors. It is as if fire decided to stop burning and instead become a part of something even hotter than itself. \n\n\nHer very presence astounds you, and you find yourself not being able to do anything but stare. It is only when she sees you, and addresses you, that you find yourself able to speak.\n\n\n\"What noble hero art thou?\" She asks you in an older version of the language you speak. \n"
