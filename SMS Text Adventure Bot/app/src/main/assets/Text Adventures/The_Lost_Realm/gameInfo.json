When you come to, your wife is missing, and your once perfect life now in tatters. What else is there to do but to kill those who have wronged you, save your wife, and restore equilibrium to your life? Before you can do this, however, you must venture through The Lost Realm...\nAuthor\u0027s Notes: Your choices matter, so choose carefully. There are 3 epilogues to be found.\nThis will likely be the first story in a series of five that I\u0027m planning, so be sure to leave feedback, and please leave any criticisms you might have. \nSpecial Thanks:\nI\u0027d like to give a huge shout out to Mayana for beta testing for me. This story game would have loads more mistakes without her help. Thanks to Mizal as well for her help with scripting. \nThis is an entry to EndMaster\u0027s 2018 Romance Story contest"]
