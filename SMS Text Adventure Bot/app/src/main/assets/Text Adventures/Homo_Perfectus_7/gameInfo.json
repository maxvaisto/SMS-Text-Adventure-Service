  "The title \"Homo Perfectus\" may not be very accurate for this story, as you do not play as a Homo Perfectus. Instead, you play as the vengeful former Imperfect Baryon, who fights against injustice, wherever he finds it, even if it includes the law.\nThis story is somewhat shorter than other Homo Perfectus stories, but still a vital part of the saga. \nWhether you can achieve the Super-heroic ending or not depends on choices you make in the very beginning, so if you can\u0027t seem to reach it, then it is possible that you simply made the wrong decisions."
