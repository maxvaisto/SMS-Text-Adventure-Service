It’s the only way he can get anyone to ‘sign-up’ for the job.\n\n \nIf you can correctly guess the \u0027odd ball,\u0027 but not whether it’s lighter or heavier than all the others, you get to go free.\n\n \nBut if you can get the right ball AND figure out whether it’s lighter or heavier - you get to keep all twelve spheres of gold. They\u0027re worth a small fortune - enough to buy your own keep - which would raise you up from lowly Surf to rich Landowner in the blink of an eye.\n\n \nWhat do you have to lose - except your dignity…\n\n \n",
