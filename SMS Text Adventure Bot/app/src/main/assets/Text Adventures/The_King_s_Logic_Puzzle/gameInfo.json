Using the scale and only 3 measurements, you must determine which is the \u0027odd ball\u0027 and whether it is lighter or heavier.\n  If you fail, you get to be court jester for a month. The king has a terrible sense of humor - trust me; you don\u0027t want to be court jester (even for just a month). It\u0027s part of the reason he holds this contest. It\u0027s the only way he can get anyone to \u0027sign-up\u0027 for the job.\n  If you can correctly guess the \u0027odd ball,\u0027 but not whether it\u0027s lighter or heavier than all the others, you get to go free.\n  But if you can get the right ball AND figure out whether it\u0027s lighter or heavier - you get to keep all twelve spheres of gold.
