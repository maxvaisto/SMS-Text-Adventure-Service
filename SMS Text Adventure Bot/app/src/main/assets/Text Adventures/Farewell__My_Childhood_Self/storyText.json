It wasn\u0027t her fault that every guy was surrounding her like a piece of meat, but it still made me angry thinking about how they undressed her with their eyes.\n\nEven back then, she was mine.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t something I questioned. Just like she never had to question that I was hers.\n\nThat\u0027s just how it was and how it\u0027d always be.\n\n\"Hey!

Her eyes lit up and I could see her fingers tapping impatiently on her sides.\n\n\"Eat up, it\u0027s delicious.\" I enthusiastically take a bite of mine, but she shakes her head. Her eyes never leaving the bowl of sherbert.\n\nIt was like there were an angel and a devil on her shoulder.

That light, that bright light was shining from within.\n\nSophia...you aren\u0027t really with me?\n\nHer body begins to fade slowly. Her hands are the first to go, then the legs, and then the torso.\n\nThe last time I see before she disappears completely is a smile. Her beautiful smile as she disappeared completely from my side.\n\nLooking down at my hands, I see a well worn tape.\n\nDid I see this tape? \n\nDoes it matter?\n","page 120":"There were flowers lining the pathway.\n\n \"Sophia?\" I ask gingerly, as though everything made sense. It didn\u0027t, it was a convoluted mess. But, somehow I knew that something was wrong. \n\n\"Can I go?\" She asks me softly and for a second, I see a light linger on her chest. So brightly, I can\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t see it in the first place.\n\n\"Go where? Are you holding a flashlight?\" I ask her, but there is no conviction in my words. As though I was a bad actor reading from a silly script.\n\n\"I need to rest. Or do you need me?\"\n\nThe static noise was getting so loud that I could barely hear her soft and silky voice. The familiar scent of cinnamon mint is now overpowering me and I feel so sick that it is a miracle I don\u0027t vomit.\n\n\"What if I was selfish?\" I can\u0027t help but ask her \"What can I do to keep you with me?\"\n\nShe smiled sadly \"Just give me a flower. I need to rewind.\"\n\nThis isn\u0027t a funny joke. If it was a joke. My mind can\u0027t think straight because of that damn static noise. I have to make a choice and I just....\n","page 6":"Of course she\u0027d be standing right behind me when I was saying this. Staring at me with sad eyes that brimmed with tears as I stupidly told the guys that there\u0027s no chance I\u0027d like a girl as childish as Sophia. In her hands was an art book that she read each day, Sophia was an artist ever since she was a child. I would joke that I was her muse, but her brillance never relied upon me really.\n\n\"Ah...\" She smiled softly, her stricken eyes staring straight into mine \"I just wanted to show you...nothing. Never mind me.\" Her hands clenched tightly around the book as she spoke. She had grown up a lot since childhood. Considering how much of a shrimp she was as a kid, she grew up like a bean sprout.  But I was still always taller, thankfully because I had a few years on her.  She was always looking up to me and I was always looking down on her.\n\n\"I\u0027ve got to go.\" She won\u0027t even give me a chance to speak.  Instead, she turns and leaves so quickly that it looks ilke she\u0027s running away from me. Next period is art class, but I could just skip. Skip and figure out what to do next.\n","page 19":"I think I wanted to do this from the very beginning.\n\nThe weather turned from sunny to rainy in what seemed like a few seconds. Or maybe hours...or days.\n\nTIme stood still when I was kissing Sophia.\n\nIt was incredibly addicting.\n\nSoft, her lips and her body was so silky soft.\n\nThat familiar scent of cinnamon mint...all it took was one whiff and I was burying her neck against my face.\n\n\"Why can\u0027t I stop kissing you?\" My words are muffled against her neck, but she laughs as though she could understand every word.\n\n\"You have to stop eventually.\" She teases and as I shook my head fervently, she asks \"Nothing lasts forever.\"\n\nThe way she said those last three words made me pause and for a moment, the chill that went down my spine wasn\u0027t from the rain water.\n","page 5":"Some excuse, right? Yeah, they didn\u0027t buy it either. Maybe it would have worked if she wasn\u0027t only two years older and stunningly beautiful to match.  But, I worked out every day, not just because I wanted to be able to fight back. That was a reason, of course I wanted to cream every guy who looked at Sophia with dirty eyes. But being younger than Sophia automatically made things more difficult. Being shorter and smaller than the girl you like? C\u0027mon.\n\nWaking up with a heavy sigh, I see the same demon face that graced the angel\u0027s body in my dream. Sophia had slipped into my bed without me noticing. The scent of cinnamon mint washing over me and already I feel intoxicated. She was a few inches away and despite crawling into bed in her ratty pjs, she easily took my breath away.\n\n Looking over at the clock, I can tell the alarm is only a few minutes from going off. Even though Sophia sneaks into my bed each morning, it always feels so short.\n","page 18":"It was a silly response.\n\nBut she turned bright red and wouldn\u0027t look my way.\n\n\"I didn\u0027t mean it.\" I say in my most sincere voice.\n\n\"I don\u0027t care.\" She\u0027d pout heavily.\n\nEventually the silence between us grew and she would sigh heavily.\n\n\"Sophia....you make me smile.\" I sing in a silly voice.\n\n\"You\u0027re an awful singer.\" She smiled and I have to admit, my voice probably was off-key the entire time. \n\n\"Better than Kermit the frog?\" I ask hopefully.\n\n\"Worse.\" She laughed.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll keep practicing then.\" I kiss the top of her forehead softly and she blushed gently.\n\n\"Does this mean I have to keep listening?\"\n\n\"I wouldn\u0027t want to sing for anyone else but you.\"\n","page 8":"Before I could memorize everything, every curve of her lips or sigh as she snuggles against the pillow, the alarm rings and it is over. The stupidly loud alarm that jolts her awake and causes her to tumble clumsily out of bed with a loud crash.\n\n\"Ow...\" Sophia sleepily groans, her eyes still shut tightly \"that hurts!\" I can already anticipate her accusing eyes staring straight into mine, so I manage to cover myself with the blanket as though an instant protective barrier would fool her.\n\n\"Hmm, really asleep?\" Sophia\u0027s voice became mischievous and already I feel regret rushing through my system. But, it is too late to give up on the charade and I\u0027m already devoted to shutting my eyes as tight as possible.  But hearing a rustle as she turned off the alarm made me curious and smelling that familiar scent of cinnamon mint became too much. I peeked and saw a beautiful smile form on Sophia\u0027s face as she caught me.\n\n\"Gotcha!\" She poked my cheek with her finger and I feel like this has happened a million times before. The first time was when we were kids. I was determined to help her draw and she was more interested in the new sticker set she got for her birthday.\n\n\"You don\u0027t have a sticker on your finger this time.\" I yawn exaggeratedly and by her expression, I can tell she doesn\u0027t quite fall for it. \"I was dreaming of us as kids.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" A curious light filled her eyes \"Fond memories of yours truly?\"\n\nBack then, I always knew Sophia was beautiful. Even though all my guy friends warned of the deadly cooties that girls carried, I\u0027d get the cootie shot a million times over as long as I could stay near Sophia.\n\n\"Just remembering how you stuck permanent glue on the sticker and how that made the removal the most painful experience of my life.\"\n\n\"Most painful experience of your life so far.\" She shoots back, completely unfazed.\n\nBack at school, it was always like that. I cam remember that day perfectly. After a long separation, I remember walking in and seeing her instantly. The other people just melted into the background.  That tended to happen when Sophia was around.\n","page 147":"\"I can do this.\" Sophia was determinedly chewing away on her spare pencil as she erased her sketching. The deadline was moved up and she was staying up all night.\n\n\"You need to rest. C\u0027mon, the bed is soft and comfy.\"\n\n\"You can go without me.\" She doesn\u0027t even shift her gaze off the paper. \"I\u0027m going to finish this.\"\n\nI already knew what she would say before she said it. Most nights, I would go ahead and impatiently wait for her to slip next to me. But tonight, I wanted to be next to her. I had to do something while I waited.\n\n\"Let me show off.\" I make a big show of getting some pens and markers.\"I\u0027ll draw you just as I see you.\"\n\nA tiny smile appeared on her lips as she answered \"I\u0027ll be looking forward to it.\"\n","page 7":"\"I\u0027m sorry.\" The loud conversations going around us in the school cafeteria somehow muted enough for us to whisper, I tried to lean in close to a very unhappy Sophia. Her hair was in a messy ponytail and her clothes were whatever she could find in the two minutes available to dress before school started.\n\n\"You\u0027re not.\" Sophia wouldn\u0027t even look at me. Her lips in a permanent pout that hadn\u0027t faded from the morning. Still, she looks beautiful. Even in messy jeans and hair that stuck out in all the wrong places.\n\n\"I must have been asleep when I turned the alarm off.\" I insist with earnest eyes. But of course, Sophia can see right through me. \"Let me make it up to you. You can\u0027t stay mad at me forever over this.\"\n\n\"Maybe I can.\" She stuck out her tongue slightly and I can\u0027t help but stare. Stare as her bubblegum tongue slowly darts in between her lips that perfectly formed a slight pout. \"But how would you make it up to me?\"\n\nI lean closer to her, slowly resting my hand on the small of her back. \"Easy. Why don\u0027t we...?\"\n","page 146":"She wasn\u0027t somone you could replace.\n\nI can\u0027t imagine being someone else\u0027s life preserver. Or placing a sticker on some random girl\u0027s cheek and feeling even close to the way I\u0027d feel with Sophia.\n\nSecrets, they were driving me crazy...\n\nBut in the end, she was the one I wanted.\n\nShe was the one I needed.\n\nI shake my head and laugh at the thought that I had any doubts.\n\nAs though I could possibly be happy without my Sophia.\n\nDo you remember her?\n\nThat static and voice, why did it pop up so randomly? As though the tape had skipped suddenly. But now, it was falling into place.\n\nThe tape will be heard.\n\n\"Of course, I remember her.\"\n","page 2":"The angel in front of me disappears and in her place is an alluring devil whose barely clad body beckons me closer.\n\nYet despite the fact that there are only a few layers that separate me from her, I feel a great distance between the two of us. As though that smile was a steel barrier that I had no shot of breaking through.\n\n\"Silly question.\"  She laughs softly, as though the answer should already be known.\n\nBefore I can ask, her hand beckons me closer and I feel the softest kiss brush against my lips. As though she cared about me. As though she knew I cared about her.\n\nThose eyes were still open when she kissed me.\n\nWas she looking at me?\n\nOr beyond?\n","page 149":"\"This is amazing!\" Sophia laughed and her bright smile matched mine as I stared back at her stunning emerald eyes.\n\n \"I aim to please.\" I smile back and feel a wave of relief wash over me as she smiles back. It was a brillant idea, even if my wallet was weeping tears of Jeffersons and Franklins along the entire island.\n\n\"C\u0027mon, we have to see everything.\" She tugged on my arm and for the entire day, we became one with the island. I ate enough pineapple to last me several lifetimes.\n\nFinally when the sun was setting and fatigue kicked in, Sophia turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"I\u0027ve got an idea.\" She laughed \"Let\u0027s draw each other.\"\n","page 1":"She smiled softly and I could see relief in her eyes. Just a flash before she shut those emerald eyes and covered her face bashfully.\n\n\"I\u0027m so relieved.\" She admitted so softly that I couldn\u0027t help but grin back. Because she spoke those words only for me to hear.\n\nBut soon the wings melted off her back and the angel in front of me disappeared. In her place was a girl, a beautiful girl with a coquettish smile and dark garb. In her hands was a barely lit candle and her eyes that had been glinting with happiness now had a knowing resignation.  \n\n\"But is it because I\u0027m gone? Or is it because you don\u0027t like being alone?\" Her voice was growing more distant and all of a sudden the air grows cold.\n\nBut before I could answer, before I could even think of what she could possibly mean, I woke up from that terrible dream.\n","page 148":"How many times did I have to drag her to the swimming pool? Probably a million. I loved being her life preserver, but there were always haunted houses and scary movies to replace the old swimming days. \n\nPlus, what if she was all alone in a pool by herself?\n\n\"I can\u0027t believe you finally know how to swim.\" We both resurface and I smile back at her. She grins back and eagerly dives into the ocean.\n\nWait, how much time has passed?\n\nI quickly dive in and see her watching a group of turtles swim beneath her feeth. Her hair floating in the air softly around her peaceful face.\n\nWhy did she only look peaceful at moments like these?\n\nWe both resurface, gasping for air. After heading off to the beach to dry off, I can hear the hooting and hollering of the local boys. Sophia always got a lot of interest wherever she went, it should have been something I have gotten used to by now. But my face turns a telltale red and Sophia asks teasingly \"What, are you jealous?\"\n","page 4":"It was a bit of a running gag in town how my parents met, how doggedly he pursued her without caring a bit about his pride or her rather formidable boyfriend whose right punch could knock out a giant for days.\n\nHe was the gangly new kid of the block and she was the beautiful princess who already had her Prince Charming.

We were always together and always linked together. Back in the day when I was interrogated by all the big kids whose eyes inevitably fell on Sophia, I gave the same excuse over and over again.

A special area away from all the other boys and girls who were always plotting nefarious schemes to outwit the opposite sex. Back then, it wasn\u0027t cool to admit that you liked a girl even though they were obviously growing up in ways that captivated interest.\n\n We would play games in that hideout. Games that Sophia usually won.  Whenever that would happen, I would hold up my hands and laughingly claim that I had let her win. Sometimes, I would be telling the truth.  But Sophia was always the picture of health in my memories. Back before...that happened.\n\n\"Found him!\" Sophia\u0027s triumphant voice rang out through the swamp as I followed close behind, wheezing slightly.\n\n\"Nice!\" I laugh as I wipe water off my face. Sophia\u0027s covered in watter too, but she doesn\u0027t care. We were both a complete mess of swamp water and mud. \"I bet Freddy is glad to be back in your hands. I swear he was hopping away from mine towards yours the entire time.\"\n\n\"You know Freddy can\u0027t tell whose hands he\u0027s hopping away or towards.\" Sophia laughed, but of course I knew differently, I knew Sophia\u0027s hands just like I knew my own. Sophia\u0027s hands were just like the rest of Sophia, soft and beautiful with just the right curves that fit perfectly in mine.\n\n\"Freddy\u0027s a guy, of course he can tell!\" I laugh, still wiping away at the dripping swamp water on my face.\n\n\"Oh...so any guy can?\" A mischievous smile crossed Sophia\u0027s face \"Does that mean you see me as a girl then?\"\n","page 99":"\"Let me draw around you.\" I stare back at her and she smiled back at me. Her eyes were still cloudy and before I can say anything else, she eagerly stands up and nods her head.\n\n\"Wait a second.\" She runs into the closet and grabs a dress. But before I can say anything, she changes out of her Christmas attire and into the dress she picked out of the closet. It was so quickly, you could blink and miss it.\n\n\"How did...?\" Before I can ask another question, my mind goes to static. It must be the wine, surely I had too much to drink. \"Just sit down there.\"\n\nShe sits down eagerly and I carefully draw clouds behind her.\n\nAfter taking a picture, she turns to me and asks \"why clouds?\n\n \"They fit.\" I can\u0027t think clearly. Not when she was so close to me.  Looking down and breathing that familiar cinnamon mint.\n\nWhat should I do?\n","page 10":"The moment I walked into the room, I could feel her eyes avert to the other side of the room. She wouldn\u0027t look at me, even as I sat right next to her and waited for the slightest opening to speak.\n\n \"Why\u0027d you change your outfit?\" Mentally, I\u0027m already hitting my forehead. As though asking an unhappy girl about her clothes would help the situation.\n\n\"I wanted to change.\"  She won\u0027t even look my way as she speaks. Her eyebrows furrowed in concentration as she draws childish butterflies and puppies.\n\n\"I wish you didn\u0027t.\" Scooting next to her, I draw a crude girl in red whose clothes cover her entire body \"You know all the boys in the class are looking at you, right?\"\n\n\"Who\u0027d look at a child?\" Sophia\u0027s pout deepens and I feel a slightly relieved smile as she responds back. At least getting her to talk was a start.\n\n\"Other children perhaps.\" Drawing in blue this time, I draw a cuddly couple and smile back at her \"You know, we\u0027re still kids Sophia. The guys before were a lot older, they even had scraggly beards and moustaches.\"\n\nA tiny smile crept across her face as she spoke \"You\u0027re growing one already.\"\n\nShe smiled!

Her eyes were wide and a strange fascination lit those beautiful emerald eyes.\n\n\"....so this is how I\u0027d look in the end.\" The words were spoken so softly I could barely hear them. An odd feeling of trepidation filled me and I couldn\u0027t let the silence fill up the space between us.\n\n\"Yeah, undead buddy!\" I lean heavily against her shoulder and for a moment, I feel her crumple against my weight. Luckily, I kept most of my weight on my other leg and manage to regain my balance before we both topple over. \"Sheesh Sophia, you used to be able to carry me on your back!\"\n\n\"We were kids back then! Things...change.\" She bit her lip as she said those last two words. As though they were the beginning words to a torrent of others that would ruin everything.\n\nI hated that. I mean, I was getting used to those odd silences, those secrets that were forming between her and me.  But that night, I wanted it to be over. But that night, Sophia still wouldn\u0027t look away from her reflection.\n\nThat reflection of a girl long dead.\n","page 13":"\"How is this making up for anything?\" Sophia huffed and puffed as she dilligently ran to keep up with my light jogging.\n\n\"Weren\u0027t you always complaining about how out of shape you\u0027ve gotten?\" I try to slow down to seem like I\u0027m helping, but a little bit of me feels happy. Before it was always me desperately chasing her, doing anything to keep up.\n\n\"Okay...so I was a total mess today and I\u0027m fat?\" Sophia laughs incredulously, but a smile still lingers on her face. Like even she knew that her as a total mess was still stunningly beautiful and that any fat on her body would be perfectly placed so you wouldn\u0027t be able to tell that she eaten a few more slices of pie than what was wise.\n\n\"You know I didn\u0027t mean it that way.\" \n\n\"Yeah, but you always say things that people misunderstand. You\u0027re going to get in a lot of trouble with girls if you don\u0027t shape up.\"\n\nApparently I was always being misunderstood by her. My dad always told me that you have to be ridiculously open to failure when it came to girls. Even though it was terrifying to make the first step, you\u0027ll make it if the girl is worth it and Sophia was worth it.\n\n It wasn\u0027t like I didn\u0027t try to give her signs. I always kept looking at her lips. Imagining how it would feel, how amazing it would feel to kiss them the first time...and the second...and the millionth.\n\n\"Hmm? \" Sophia paused in front of me and leaned forward. Her face slightly covered with a sheen of sweat \"Did you fall in love with me?\" She laughed a little at the end, certain that I hadn\u0027t.\n\nIt was kinda suprising how clueless Sophia could be. Or maybe cruel would be a better word.\n","page 15":"\"Coward.\" My little sister wasn\u0027t the type that minced her words, biting as they may be.\n\n\"You have to understand it from a guy\u0027s perspective.\" I shoot back \"What if she pushed me away?\"\n\n\"Sophia?\" Emily laughed, her eyes stil glued to her NDS \"Well, as long as we\u0027re playing the \u0027what if\u0027 scenarios...what if she didn\u0027t?\"\n\n\"This doesn\u0027t help Em...\" Leaning back with a heavy sigh, I ask \"What can I do?\"\n\n\"Run to her house with a boombox and play a song by Peter Gabriel?\" Emily laughed \"Or maybe you could visit her.

It wasn\u0027t something that happened often, thank goodness. I couldn\u0027t stand it if Sophia was upset with me. It was back at an age when girls and boys didn\u0027t really hang out together.  But, Sophia was different. It was just her and me. It was something I never questioned, like the air I breathed.  So when she wasn\u0027t happy....\n\n\"I won\u0027t forgive you next time.\" Sophia would say each time she bit angrily into her favorite toasted bagel.\n\nOddly enough, it was charming. As she tried to appear angry as she bit into her toasted bagel, I\u0027d find myself hiding a smile the entire time. She\u0027d always forgive me, no matter what screw-up I made.\n\nEven though I felt comforted that she had forgiven me in the past, it didn\u0027t make the memory of Sophia\u0027s hurt face feel any better. I had to do something, but what?\n","page 14":"To this day, I don\u0027t know how I had the courage to do it. For anyone thinking movies portray a first kiss correctly, then I\u0027m very sorry to let you all down. Because as I leaned forward to kiss the girl of my dreams, I watch her blank expression only turn to a look of complete surprise. I kept waiting for the moment where her eyes closed and a blush spread across those perfect angular cheeks, but she looked like she had seen a ghost.  All I could do was close my eyes and very quickly kiss her lightly on the lips, a kiss where I\u0027m fairly certain my teeth had been exposed accidently and gave her a slight bite instead of a caress.\n\nFor a girl who smells just like cinnamon mint, she tasted completely different. She must have drank cherry soda at lunch because my first kiss tasted exactly like cherry coke. Sweet with a sparkle of electricity running through my system. There was even a buzzing noise...wait a second, what?\n\n\"I...have to go.\" Before I could open my eyes, I can hear Sophia open her cell phone and feel her entire demeanor change. It was not a friendly everyday text message, not at all.\n\nOpen your eyes you idiot! I want so badly to see her expression, I do. But there is something so terrifyingly vulnerable about this moment, this magical moment when I finally got to kiss Sophia that makes opening my eyes suddenly impossible. By the time I manage to get the strength, she\u0027s gone. Her running figure making me all the more curious as to what could possibly have been sent in that annoying text.\n\nMentally, I had a much different reaction from her. She was smiling back into my eyes with a growing smile, one that was nearly as wide as mine.\n\n\"Hey!\" Before I can fully sink into the ground in my misery, I hear Sophia\u0027s voice. She\u0027s far enough that I can\u0027t quite see her face, but I hear her perfectly. \"Leave your window unlocked!\"\n\nA wave of relief rushes over me and I try not to grin like an idiot.\n\nTried and probably failed miserably.\n\nThat night, I didn\u0027t sleep a wink. Not when I heard the window slowly creak open and feel Sophia slowly slip right next to me.  \n","page 17":"She would always have the same reaction to that statement. First, she\u0027d look away with a feigned haughty air, as though she wanted me to believe that she knew I\u0027d answer that way. But, I would always catch a glimpse of her face before she turned. I would see her smile and it was beautiful.\n\nHow could anyone see her and not see a beautiful girl?\n\n\"Hey, what are you thinking of?\" Sophia was munching on a tasty treat and I couldn\u0027t help but lean my head against hers.\n\n\"You.\"\n\nShe blushed and honestly, I kept thinking how lucky I was. How perfect these days were all the time.\n\nWait, is that possible?\n\nStatic in the background and it feels like my eyes are getting a little blurry. But I shake my head and try to ignore that dizzy feeling.\n\nIt\u0027ll be all right as long as Sophia is with me.\n\n \"Hey stranger.\" I guess I had been silent too long and Sophia poked my cheek gently \"Penny for your thoughts?\"\n\nTo be honest, all I could think of was one thing.\n","page 16":"\"This place is amazing!\" Sophia smiled widely, her eyes dancing with excitement as she stared at the beautiful sea life swimming before our eyes.\n\n\"Well, I aim to please.\" Sticking out my chest, I match her smile perfectly. \"C\u0027mon, let me try to show off my completely useless knowledge of all sea life.\" \n\n\"How are you such an expert on these things?\" Sophia leaned closely near me and I easily wrapped my arm around her waist. It just felt natural, like taking a step forward.\n\n\"My mom and dad met at Sea World, so they went there religiously each year with me in tow.\" I can\u0027t help but suddenly feel awkward. Sophia was so close and my hand was getting sweaty. Sweaty enough that I had to focus a good deal of my attention to make sure it didn\u0027t slip.\n\n\"Well, thanks for taking me here.\" She smiled back at me and for a moment, it felt like the world has paused. The fishes stopped swimming and Sophia was just standing there.\n\nIf there was ever a moment, now would be it.\n","page 91":"\"You look great!\" I can\u0027t speak well with the fake vampire teeth in my mouth, but I manage to at least sound somewhat understandable.\n\nBut Sophia was staring at her reflection in the mirror with an odd expression.

I laughed gently, but could hear her softly grumble as her pillow (me) shifted around and made her spot less comfortable.\n\nWhat if things were different?\n\nLet\u0027s change the story now.\n\nWhat if I could save her?\n","page 34":"I couldn\u0027t help it.\n\nMy arm was already being used by her as a pillow. I kept my eyes closed and hugged her closely. Her body was incredibly soft. She fit perfectly against me and was so close that I could feel every bit of her on top of me. I\u0027ve probably hugged Sophia a million times when I was younger. But tonight was different, everything felt different.\n\n\"Hey...\" Her soft scent of cinnamon mint wafted over me \"You can\u0027t be without me?\" \n\nThe way she asked that question was strange. It was a question she had asked me a million times before. But tonight, it sounded like there was a hitch in her voice, an accidental slip.\n\n\"You know the answer.\" I can\u0027t help but smile goofily at Sophia. Even though I know neither one of us are directly addressing the issue at hand, the kiss or the accidental biting of her lips, if you wanted to get more specific.\n\n\"Would you miss me?\" A slighly lonely expression still lingered on her face \"If I was gone?\"\n","page 37":"\"I can\u0027t believe you ordered the Mega Chocolate Sundae Supreme.\" Sophia\u0027s voice is awed as she surveys what surely is the largest chocolate sundae topped with cherries.\n\n\"Plus chocolate sticks and hot chocolate, just in case of unexpected brain freezes.\" I smile eagerly towards Sophia as I nurse a tiny baby dip of ice cream.\n\n\"You really regret what you said, huh?\" A tiny smile formed on her lips, those perfect lips thatI could stare at all day.\n\n\"My wallet does. But I don\u0027t.\" Smiling back, I lick my ice cream cone \"I get to see you eat the entire Mega Chocolate Sundae Supreme by yourself.\"\n\n\"Hey, I thought we were sharing!\"\n","page 36":"\"You really think she\u0027d follow after you ditched her?\"My little sister wasn\u0027t the type that minced her words, biting as they may be.\n\n\"You have to understand it from a guy\u0027s perspective.\" I shoot back \"What if she pushed me away?\"\n\n\"Sophia?\" Emily laughed, her eyes stil glued to her NDS \"Well, as long as we\u0027re playing the \u0027what if\u0027 scenarios...what if she didn\u0027t?\"\n\n\"This doesn\u0027t help Em...\" Leaning back with a heavy sigh, I ask \"What can I do?\"\n\n\"Run to her house with a boombox and play a song by Peter Gabriel?\" Emily laughed \"Or maybe you could visit her. Sophia texted me that she\u0027s sick and I think you can step it up and maybe change this.\"\n","page 38":"It was fate.\n\nAs I kissed her and she kissed me, it felt like I was sinking into the ground and just feeling everything along the way.\n\nSoft. Silky. Smooth.\n\nA taste of cinnamon mint.\n\nA nibble of vanilla.\n\nIt was intoxicating.\n\nMy brain was turning into mush, even more so because it was so late at night.\n\nThe only question was whether or not I could stop.\n","page 31":"\"Why are you here?\" Sophia\u0027s voice was stuffy and she was completely covered in tissues. I had to wipe away the mound to get to the pretty girl underneath.\n\n\"A little bird told me I had to bring chicken noodle soup and tea.\" I hold out the bag \"It\u0027s your favorite kind.\"\n\n\"What a messed up little bird.\" Sophia grinned back, but her eyes still look miserable. \"I didn\u0027t want you to see me like this.\"\n\nSitting down next to her, I had to smile. She was looking down and blushing as though she was a complete mess. But even as a mess, Sophia could make my heart skip a beat any day.\n\n\"I\u0027ve seen you covered in mud before. Remember when we caught Freddy?\"\n\n\"So you still remember how awful I looked even though it was years ago?\" Sophia\u0027s eyes grew wide with horror. \n\n\"C\u0027mon, let me make up for this constant foot in my mouth.\" I plead with her.\n\nShe looks at me straightforwardly with those brillant emerald eyes. \"How?\"\n\nGood question.\n","page 30":"Sophia had a secret ever since she was a kid. She couldn\u0027t swim. Push her into a pool barely above her head and she\u0027d drown without a life preserver.\n\n\"It\u0027s not like I forgot what you said earlier.\" Sophia\u0027s arms were snugly wrapped around my neck as she tried desperately to keep afloat.\n\n\"I thought girls like being told they were young.\" Keeping my voice as light as possible, I feel a warm blush spread across my cheeks. Sophia was close, really close. Her soft warm body pressed tightly against mine and even though the pool water had a distinct smell of chlorine, her familiar scent of cinnamon mint washed over me.\n\n\"That only applies to women when they\u0027re much older. Not kids.\" Pouting heavily, Sophia couldn\u0027t maintain an angry tone as I served as her swim buddy/life preserver in the school\u0027s swimming pool.\n\nIt would be too much to claim a stroke of luck in having Sophia as my pool buddy. Outright bribery of her fellow classmate and swimming instructor was the only possible way I could be Sophia\u0027s swimming buddy ever since the school year began.  Considering how Sophia hadn\u0027t learned how to swim, or even float...I can\u0027t really claim to be the best kind of swim buddy around.\n\nLike heck I cared about that though. Being Sophia\u0027s life preserver was a right only for me. \n","page 170":"I close my eyes and hear that odd static noise I\u0027ve noticed before and tried to ignore.\n\n\"You don\u0027t want this to be the end?\" A soft and silky voice asks. It\u0027s not Sophia\u0027s voice, but it sounds oddly familiar. Like a younger version that had both her and me mixed in.\n\n\"I don\u0027t, of course I don\u0027t.\" Opening my eyes, I see the carbon copy of Sophia as a young child. The only difference was her eyes were clear. This child wasn\u0027t Sophia.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nShe smiled happily, hugging a familiar teddy bear. \"You can\u0027t recognize your own child? What kind of a daddy do I have?\"\n\nThe surroundings are different and for some reason, I feel older. My bones are creaky and when I reach up to touch my chin, I feel a grizzled beard.\n\n\"What...is going on?\" My head is swirrling and at this point, she could have told me that I was dead and I would have believed her. \n\nInstead, the little child replied \"You can change the past daddy. If you\u0027re willing to lose this future.\"\n\nHer arms were so tightly wrapped around her tiny body, but her voice didn\u0027t waver.\n\nAs though she already knew my answer.\n","page 172":"\"Hey stranger.\" Sophia\u0027s familiar face, that beautiful face that haunted my every dream and memory, finally appeared. \"I guess I have a lot of explaining to do.\"\n\nShe sighed softly and shook her head slightly. \"I wanted to tell you...a million times. Everyday, I wanted to tell you. That day I got diagnosed, all I could think of was how I could tell you.\"\n\nShe paused and for a second, her chin trembles. Her bangs covering her eyes so I can\u0027t possibly see them. But she takes a second to breathe in and looks up with a smile. \"I guess I wanted to be selfish in the end. I\u0027m sorry about that. But, I wanted to be with you. Every day, I wanted to be with you. I knew...that the treatment had such little chance of working and I\u0027d never get to see you and I was so scared and...\"\n\nTears fill her eyes and I can tell she\u0027s widening them as much as possible so not a single tear falls. Before it can possibly fall, she places both her fingers on her cheeks and smiles widely. \"Please, forgive me? I want you to remember me like this. Healthy and always, loving you.\"\n\nThe tape ended and I looked through the box. There were only one piece of notebook paper.\n\nWas it her handwriting? Or was it someone else?\n\nAll it said was a hospital and a room number.\n","page 171":"\"You can\u0027t have everything.\"\n\nThe little girl was melting away, her smile still firmly in place. The ground shakes and all of a sudden, I wake in a beautiful open space. It was as close to heaven as I could picture it, minus the floating angels and clouds.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I shout to the sky, but there is no response. Instead, I can only see two lakes ahead of me. One had a sign labeled \"Save Sophia\" and the other had a sign labeled \"Save your child.\"\n\nIt was a trade.\n\nI had to trade one for the other.\n\n\"You...\" I\u0027m not even sure who I\u0027m speaking to at this moment \"can\u0027t possibly be serious?\"\n","page 174":"Hitting the ground with a thud, I can hear my phone vibrate. Emily was with Sophia at the hospital and for some miraculous reason, she was recovering. Slowly but surely, Sophia was responding to treatment.\n\n\"But...\" Emily\u0027s voice grew sad \"She lost baby.\"\n\nA loud silence engulfed the two of us and all I can say is \"I\u0027ll be there. Tell Sophia, I\u0027ll be there.\"\n\nIt was months before Sophia would speak. She would cry every day, even when she had barely the strength to breathe. All I could do was be with her, hold her whenever she cried, and wonder.\n\nWas it a dream?\n\n\"Hey....\" Sophia looked at me with her deep emerald eyes \"can you believe we\u0027re married?\"\n\nI look at her and feel like I can\u0027t believe anything. Leaning forward to kiss her on her lips, I can only smile as she kisses me back.\n\n\"Hey you two lovebirds, don\u0027t forget about the wedding cake!\" Emily laughed as she happily brought Sophia and I to the table.\n\n\"Why does my figure have such a weird expression?\" I laugh as Sophia gently holds my hand and a knife.\n\n\"Hehe, you always have that expression.\" She laughs and for a moment, a brief moment, my life was perfect.\n\n.\n\n..\n\n...\n\n....\n\nBut don\u0027t tell me you forgot the price you paid for this happiness?\n","page 173":"Hitting the ground with a thud, I can hear my phone vibrate. Emily was with Sophia at her last moments and it turned out there was a baby. \"She\u0027s premature and hanging on by a thread, but a beautiful baby...\"\n\n\"Girl.\"\n\n\"...Did Sophia tell you she was pregnant?\"\n\n\"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" I stand up and start running towards the car. \"I\u0027ve got to see her.\"\n\nIt was months before they let me take her home. Sara was hanging on by a thread for days, but she was strong like her mother. Her body was so small, everyone thought she wasn\u0027t going to make it.\n\nBut, I always knew better.\n\n\"Hey there.\" Gently rocking her back and forth, I felt Sara softly nuzzle against my neck. \"You don\u0027t like sleeping alone?\"\n\nShe gurgles appreciatively and I hold her closely.\n\n\"It\u0027s okay, I\u0027m here.\"\n\nAs I close my eyes, I smell the familiar scent of cinnamon mint. Just a hint in the wind.\n\nAs though maybe, Sophia was here too.\n","page 176":"\"Hey, how are you doing?\" Sophia\u0027s sister hugs her tightly as we slowly make our way to the graveyard.\n\nThe place where our child was buried.\n\nWe first went after the hospital stay, clothed only in the darkest black and funeral attire. The whitest roses adorned her grave. It was there we all made the solemn vow to return there the day...that terrible day...she died.\n\n\"It\u0027s always tough coming here.\" Sophia admitted softly, her voice crackling slightly \"But...it helps.\"\n\nWe now dressed up in bright clothing. Not because we were happy, but...wouldn\u0027t it be a shame? If our only daughter saw us in dark funeral garb each time?\n\n\"Hey, I heard the good news. When are you due? Did you find out whether it\u0027s going to be a boy or a girl?\" Sophia\u0027s sister had a growing smile and finally a smile appeared on Sophia\u0027s face.\n\n\"We\u0027ve got at least a year to go. But, he\u0027s sure for some reason it\u0027s a girl. A beautiful girl who has both of our eyes.\"\n","page 155":"\"This is amazing!\" Sophia laughed and her bright smile matched mine as I stared back at her stunning emerald eyes.\n\n \"I aim to please.\" I smile back and feel a wave of relief wash over me as she smiles back. It was a brillant idea, even if my wallet was weeping tears of Jeffersons and Franklins along the entire island.\n\n\"C\u0027mon, we have to see everything.\" She tugged on my arm and for the entire day, we became one with the island. I ate enough pineapple to last me several lifetimes.\n\nFinally when the sun was setting and fatigue kicked in, Sophia turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"I\u0027ve got an idea.\" She laughed \"Let\u0027s draw each other.\"\n","page 158":"How many times did I have to drag her to the swimming pool? Probably a million. I loved being her life preserver, but there were always haunted houses and scary movies to replace the old swimming days. \n\nPlus, what if she was all alone in a pool by herself?\n\n\"I can\u0027t believe you finally know how to swim.\" We both resurface and I smile back at her. She grins back and eagerly dives into the ocean.\n\nWait, how much time has passed?\n\nI quickly dive in and see her watching a group of turtles swim beneath her feeth. Her hair floating in the air softly around her peaceful face.\n\nWhy did she only look peaceful at moments like these?\n\nWe both resurface, gasping for air. After heading off to the beach to dry off, I can hear the hooting and hollering of the local boys. Sophia always got a lot of interest wherever she went, it should have been something I have gotten used to by now. But my face turns a telltale red and Sophia asks teasingly \"What, are you jealous?\"\n","page 157":"\"I can do this.\" Sophia was determinedly chewing away on her spare pencil as she erased her sketching. The deadline was moved up and she was staying up all night.\n\n\"You need to rest. C\u0027mon, the bed is soft and comfy.\"\n\n\"You can go without me.\" She doesn\u0027t even shift her gaze off the paper. \"I\u0027m going to finish this.\"\n\nI already knew what she would say before she said it. Most nights, I would go ahead and impatiently wait for her to slip next to me. But tonight, I wanted to be next to her. I had to do something while I waited.\n\n\"Let me show off.\" I make a big show of getting some pens and markers.\"I\u0027ll draw you just as I see you.\"\n\nA tiny smile appeared on her lips as she answered \"I\u0027ll be looking forward to it.\"\n","page 159":"\"It\u0027s freezing!\" Sophia\u0027s complaint sounded like music to my ears. It gave me the perfect excuse to sneak up behind her and wrap my arms around hers.\n\n \"You\u0027re cold!\" She yelped and tossed me quickly to the side.\n\n\"Ouch, isn\u0027t body heat supposed to help?\" I exaggeratedly rub my sides, but she\u0027s shivering so badly that I stop.\n\n\"It helps only when the person doesn\u0027t have ice on them as well.\" She pouts sadly, her breath softly floating in the air in a tiny stream.\n\n\"Here.\" Sighing heavily, I hand over my only coat and feel instantly the air freeze around me.\n\n\"Why\u0027d you do that?\" I look over at Sophia, but she\u0027s not moving. All of a sudden, the scene froze around me.\n\n\"Who\u0027s there?\" I yell, but the voice chuckles. \n\nWhy does it sound so familar?\n\n\"Let\u0027s forward this scene. Do you remember how you drew her?\"\n\nA female\u0027s voice...it was a female\u0027s voice. That\u0027s all I can remember as the world fades to black.\n","page 44":"\"You know that this can\u0027t work each time.\" Sophia pouted and I have to admit, that threat would have been more effective had she not been smiling.\n\n\"There\u0027s a lot of cotton candy flavors.\" I tease her but for a moment, she pulls back on my hand and looks back into my eyes. Those brillant emerald eyes could see through me easily.\n\n\"Next time, I mean it.\"\n\n\"I promise.\" I look back and reach out my hand \"I won\u0027t make the same mistake again.\"\n\nShe smiled and for a few minutes, everything was perfect.\n\nThat was until she stopped and asked \"Wait, you still are going to make mistakes in the future, aren\u0027t you?\"\n\nShe knew me too well.\n\n\"Of course not.\" I look at her my most innocent eyes.\n\nShe stuck her tongue out at me \"Next time, I like ice cream.\"\n","page 43":"\"Hey, why do you think they tell the story about the Man in the Moon?\" Sophia was walking just quickly enough to remain out of reach, looking back only now and then to smile back at me.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t a happy smile though. At least, not entirely.\n\n\"To remind us of what we have.\" I smile back, we always had this exchange late at night.\n\nI can\u0027t remember why we started it though. Maybe it made her feel better?\n\n\"How so?\" Sophia asked, her voice filled with curiosity as though I haven\u0027t answered it a million times before.\n\n\"Because the moon is always alone. It only can reflect light, never create it. The moon wouldn\u0027t exist if it wasn\u0027t for the sun. But the sun could exist without the moon.\"\n\n\"What about the stars?\" Sophia slowed down enough for me to catch up \"The stars are alwasy around the moon.\"\n\n\"Those stars don\u0027t matter. You can be alone in a crowd if the person you want by your side isn\u0027t there.\"\n\nShe paused and finally I realized how I messed up the script.\n\n\"You said person.\"\n\n\"A star, a person...whatever.\"\n","page 46":"\"My friend the slacker, huh?\" Sophia sighed exaggeratedly, a slight giggle accompanying her solemn words.\n\n\"A terrible slacker to the end.\" I admit sadly, but the entire time I have to hide a grin.\n\nIt was just like old times.\n\n\"Well, you have to snack regularly. An artist cannot function on an empty stomach.\"\n\n\"You just want an excuse to eat sweets, don\u0027t you?\" I knock my shoulder against hers and she pouted.\n\n\"What, do other girls not eat sweets?\" Sophia sulked.\n\n\"I didn\u0027t mean that.\" I sigh and hold up my hands \"Why don\u0027t we compromise? A fun activity and then study time?\"\n\n\"My friend the slacker, huh?\" Sophia sighed again.\n","page 45":"\"This is amazing!\" Sophia laughed and her bright smile matched mine as I stared back at her stunning emerald eyes.\n\n \"I aim to please.\" I smile back and feel a wave of relief wash over me as she smiles back.

Her eyes looking like they were brimming with tears. \"Please, don\u0027t forget me.\"\n\nHer kisses tasted salty and sweet. But I couldn\u0027t live with myself if I did anything when she was like that. So I just held her close and kissed her until both of us were to exhausted to do anything but fall asleep.\n\nWhy would I need to miss her if she\u0027ll always be with me?\n\nWhy was she crying?\n\nI want so badly to ask her. But for some reason, it feels like she\u0027ll disappear if I ask those words. So all I can do is just pull her closer and hope that maybe, just maybe, Sophia would stay.\n","page 49":"\"Do you like it?\"\n\n I honestly never was a fan of chocolate as a kid.\n\nSophia blushed as she covered up the parts of her body that wasn\u0027t submerged in chocolate.\n\nBut in this case, I think things are about to change.\n\n\"How did you...?\" I can\u0027t even comprehend how she pulled this off.

Any kind of comprehensible thought in my brain stops and all I can do is react.\n\nTo kiss her when she kisses me back.\n\nTo slip off that one-piece off her shoulder.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" I ask her hoarsely.\n\nShe nods softly and I give in.\n","page 41":"She was stunning.\n\n \"They\u0027re all staring.\" Sophia\u0027s arm was wrapped so tightly around my neck that at times, it was a bit hard to breathe.\n\nBut maybe that was because of how close she was and how easily she could take your breath away.\n\n\"They\u0027re jealous.\" I whispered back, trying to keep a silly grin off of my face.

But before I can say anything, she changes out of her Christmas attire and into the dress she picked out of the closet. It was so quickly, you could blink and miss it.\n\n\"How did...?\" Before I can ask another question, my mind goes to static. It must be the wine, surely I had too much to drink. \"Just sit down there.\"\n\nShe sits down eagerly and I carefully draw flowers around her.\n\nAfter taking a picture, she turns to me and asks \"Why flowers?\n\n \"They fit.\" I can\u0027t think clearly.

Everyday, I wanted to tell you. That day I got diagnosed, all I could think of was how I could tell you.\"\n\nShe paused and for a second, her chin trembles.

Or was it someone else?\n\nAll it said was a hospital and a room number.\n","page 109":"I had to listen to her last request.\n\nMy eyelids were so heavy that it felt as though they were glued shut, I was surrounded by darkness that I could see and feel with every inch of my being.   But oddly enough, I wasn’t scared.\n\n“Really, you came here?” A gentle voice wrapped around me and I felt a familiar happiness that I hadn’t felt in the longest time.  The sweetest scent of cinnamon mint entered my mouth and a pair of the softest lips brushed against mine.  So soft at first that I can barely feel it, but she leans in closer and already I’m melting into a happiness that had long disappeared one terrible night long ago.\n\n“I…don’t want to wake up if it’s a dream.” Mumbling, my eyes feel a lot less heavy but I’m too scared to open them.  Too many times I’ve talked with Sophia and open my eyes to see an open space. “If this is a dream, I don’t ever want to wake up.”\n\n“Hmmm….” I can hear a teasing smile in her voice, that soft and gentle voice that ran circles in my head every day since she left “how can I prove to you this isn’t a dream then?”\n\n“Stay with me.” Immediately, the words I could never say before finally fall from my lips. “Don’t ever leave me again.”\n\nSilence.  Then I felt her warmth spread through my arm as she gently nestled her head against my shoulder, leaning her body close to mine as she wrapped her arms around my neck.  I clung to her like a drowning man would cling to the only piece of ship; I clung to her like she was the only existence in this darkness, which to me was the truth.\n\nTrailing my fingers against her soft cheek, that tiny slope on the back of her neck, I felt as though I was falling.  I was falling and I didn’t, no…I couldn’t stop.  If I stopped, if I let her go…at that moment it felt as though some part of me must have known.  Known that this was going to be the last dream, the last kiss, the last time Sophia would ever be able to fulfill my only wish.\n\n\nThe tips of her fingers slowly tracing words on the back of my neck, at first I jumped before slowly closing my eyes. Even though this isn’t real…the cool darkness is feeling less lonely, less unbearably lonely by the second.\n\n“I…love you…” Her fingers slowly traced the words over and over again, but it didn’t take long for the words to fill my back as though the words had taken on an entirely new life of their own. Warm…it was so warm… A sigh danced lightly upon my lips before I quickly swallowed it back, savoring what little warmth that carelessly lingered by.\n\n“Bye...” Before I can open my eyes, I feel a pair of lips that had long lost any semblance of warmth press so gently against my back that when I opened my eyes and softly pressed the tips of my fingers to the exact spot her lips had touched, it was already gone.  The air had already stolen it away, a kiss that never existed to begin with.\n","page 54":"\"Hey.\" Sophia smiled awkwardly.\n\nHow much time has passed?\n\nHer hair was so much longer.

They were so pale, her entire body was so pale that it seemed like all the color was sucked out of her by those infernal tubes.\n\n\"I mean it.\" I gently squeeze her hand and smile back for real this time \"I could never lie to you.\"\n\nShe laughed slightly, but the laugh ends in a coughing fit.

He felt like two of Sophias, even though she easily towered over him.\n\n\"Hey stranger.\" She smiled back and I can\u0027t help but smile. \"Is that my birthday present?\"\n\n\"I wanted to wrap him up but he refused to cooperate.\" I sadly admit as the puppy coughed up a scrap of wrapping paper. \n\n\"Hmm, what\u0027s your name cutie?\" Sophia asked the puppy softly.\n\n\"I think you should give him one. It is your dog after all.\" \n\n\"How about Marley?\" Sophia asks and it was at that moment, the puppy decided to lick her face.\n\n\"I guess he likes it!\" We laugh together and for a moment, a brief moment, I feel like everything is okay.\n\nBut the moments started becoming rare. So rare, that even I realized it. Even during the moments when you acted like everything would be okay.\n\nDid you believe it?\n\nOr were you pretending like that day?\n","page 62":"\"Stay still!\"\n\n It was impossible to stay still when I could feel her eyes on me.\n\nFirst, she would stare at my face. Then, my arms. Then, my neck.\n\nIt was enough to drive me crazy.\n\n\"Hey, you moved!\" Sophia laughed and I snapped back into place.\n\nSeveral hours passed before she was satisified, but that was Sophia. A perfectionist to the end, she could always find the tiniest flaws in her work that people would praise as masterpieces.\n\n\"C\u0027mon, it\u0027s late.\" After she finished sketching, she was busy coloring in the lines. While I was happy to see the painting that caused the horrible crick in my neck to form, I wanted to see her, touch her, feel her.\n\nAll things that were impossible as she sat in that high chair.\n\n\"Hmm...\" She looked back at me with questioning eyes \"What are you going to do now?\"\n","page 64":"I say the words softly, but not because I\u0027m scared of other people hearing it. I say it softly into her ear, pleading with her to listen. To trust me when I tell her something because I\u0027ll always say the truth to her.\n\nShe smiles, but there is a hint of sadness to her smile as she asks just as softly \"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"Not really.\" Leaning my forehead against her head, I whisper back \"Young or old, I\u0027d like you either way.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" A small laugh escaped her lips \"Your dad\u0027s sappy lines are rubbing off on you.\"\n\nWe both looked at each other and laughed. Of course, that moment was broken up by the swimming instructor who had noticed Sophia and I standing still in the middle of the pool while the other students were diligently swimming away.  While other people\u0027s conversations had faded completely to me when Sophia was nearby, the paddleboard to the head knocked me unconscious and Sophia had to get help to drag my floating body to the poolside for safety.\n\n\"You definitely owe me one now.\" Sophia laughed and her smile was so wide that I didn\u0027t mind the inevitable debt that my poor wallet would have to pay for her surprisingly insatiable stomach.\n\n\"Same place, same time.\" I toss back with a matching smile.\n\nSophia was already waiting patiently at our usual place. Her hair tied back neatly and I was struck by her new glasses.\n\n\"They make me look like a dork.\" Sophia sighed \"But I can\u0027t stand wearing contacts after swimming.\"\n\n\"You look smart.\" I gently knock my shoulder against hers.\n\n\"Wait, does that mean I don\u0027t look like smart if I don\u0027t have glasses on?\u0027 Sophia knocked back with her shoulder against mine, a bit harder than I had.\n","page 63":"\"Hmph.\"\n\nApparently, there was nothing else to do on this island.\n\n\"Hmph.\" Sophia sighed heavily again and I could see both Sophia and Angie staring at me from the corner of their eyes.\n\nThe entire time, Marley was blissfully yawning in the sunlight.\n\nLucky dog.\n\n\"C\u0027mon, we can do other things.\" I try to hand out an olive branch.\n\n\"Psh, just go meet other girls.\" Angie pouted and i have to admit, she played the role of Sophia\u0027s sister as though it was her sole purpose in life. Even if it was completely overboard, she mirrored her mood to Sophia\u0027s mood. So no matter what, I couldn\u0027t ignore how Sophia was feeling.\n\nSomehow, this felt like a lose-lose situation.\n","page 181":"She was only wearing adornments in her hair, the rest of Sophia was clad just as she was born. We had actually taken baths together when we were kids. Back then, I couldn\u0027t realize how stunningly beautiful she always was. \n\n\"Always remember..please.\" I can\u0027t quite hear the words she\u0027s whispering though. I can only catch fragments. Her beautiful emerald eyes won\u0027t open though. They won\u0027t look back into mine anymore and for some reason, that terrifies me.\n\nLeaning forward, my fingers barely graze her arm when I shudder. Her skin is cold, ice cold. Even though she has a rosy blush and her body looks perfect, she feels like a corpse. A beautiful talking corpse of the girl of my dreams.\n\n\"Please...forgive me....\" Her lips keep moving and I feel afraid. Like I\u0027m remembering something I don\u0027t want to remember.\n\nLike the moment I remember, she\u0027ll be gone.\n\nGreen eyed girl, why are you crying?\n\nDid the world treat you badly enough to feel like dying?\n\nStop it. I shake my head and look down at my hands. My hands that were empty before are now filled with...\n","page 180":"\"I\u0027m ready.\"\n\n She tried so hard to seem like an adult. Even the lingerie she bought was clearly for someone much older.\n\nMy mouth was dry and I could feel a gallon of sweat begin to pour down my forehead. But she was absolutely perfect.\n\nAbsolutely perfect.\n\nIn my arms, she was so tiny. Was Sophia always this small? Before I can ask, she stops me with a kiss. Any kind of comprehensible thought in my brain stops and all I can do is react.\n\nTo kiss her when she kisses me back.\n\nTo slip off that one-piece off her shoulder.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" I ask her hoarsely.\n\nShe nods softly and I give in.\n\n \n","page 183":"She was only wearing adornments in her hair, the rest of Sophia was clad just as she was born.
