Your side manages to eliminate most of them before the horde reaches you.\n\nUnfortunately this isn’t enough. While your side fights valiantly, you’re outnumbered as usual and don’t really have the raw power to at least fight them off properly. Indeed that’s been the whole problem with the Garwold defense. Gnomes and Halflings have never been the best fighters in a straight up battle.\n\nDoesn’t take long before your dead are rising to join the enemy. You attempt to target the enemy necromancer, but you can’t get a clear shot, and it won’t help with the second dead army that is now heading over the hill now.\n\nYou sound a retreat, but you won’t be joining few survivors left as a Death Knight smashes you in the side of the head with a swing of his fail. You fall to the ground dazed and bloody. As you attempt to get up, your mind begins to fill music. A little tune to take you away from this place…\n\nYou look up just in time to see a blurry outline of the Death Knight who finishes the job and crushes your skull completely.\n","page 32":"Dear Mom,\n\nWell I got my first assignment. I’m heading to the Retlad Kingdom. Unlike most of my fellow cadets I was given the choice to go there instead of the Tulan Border. Thank the gods for my excellent bow skills.\n\nStill it’s not going to be an easy assignment, but I’m probably not as worried about it as I might normally be since I finally got paid and managed to buy myself another lute! I’ve been practicing it again to help me keep my mind off things. I made arrangements for most of my pay to be sent to you. You should be receiving it at the end of each month, I hope it’ll help.\n\nAnyway, tomorrow is the big day, so I better get some early sleep tonight. I have no idea what to expect.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son\n","page 76":"You know that this is most likely a losing battle, but some hope might be gained, if you can somehow draw out the knights and specters and get them by themselves. As powerful as they are, they’re very hard to control even by necromancers and get easily agitated by living creatures.\n\nYou can’t do it alone though. You take your best archers and a couple of your best wizards and mention your plan. You don’t ask for volunteers, you just assign. You’re in charge and you have to make the hard decisions, even if it might mean you’ll die. They don’t look enthused, but you aren’t either.\n\nYou tell everyone else to hold their ground while you and your small platoon ride towards the horde.\n\n“Ready those blessed silvers men, and you robe wearers melt those dead tin cans!”\n\nYou get close enough and you unleash as many blessed silver arrows as you can at the Blood Specters. You kill a few. The wizards don’t do quite as well with the knights. However, both attacks are enough.\n\nYou see the Specters and Knights making whatever unearthly noises they do and begin to advance towards you far ahead of the slower yet steady moving horde. It apparent that the necromancer controlling them is attempting to bring them back under control, because they begin to squirm back and forth which gives you some more time to kill a few more during their confusion. Eventually the necromancer must give up total control because they stop squirming and advance upon you once again.\n\nYou ride back as quickly as possible with the Specters and Knights in full pursuit. You didn’t expect those Specters to be so fast. A few of them manage to catch up to some of your men with grisly results. You yourself almost get smacked upside the head by a Death Knight mace. When you get back in range the rest of your awaiting army deals with your pursuers. More blessed arrows fly into the Blood Specters before they can do anymore harm, and eventually the Death Knights are brought down as well.\n\nThere is no time for a reprieve though, as the main horde is now almost upon you. You order a regrouping as best you can, and face the enemy, telling if possible for someone to aim for the necromancer in all of this rotting mess.\n\nBones and limbs from both sides are broken and hacked off. A zombie skull is smashed, splashing maggots, blood and brains all over you and you’re not even thinking about it. You just have a tune in your head to take yourself away from the massacre. Somehow in all of the chaos, you single out the necromancer leading this army, he stands a far piece away from the main fighting, but he’s arrogant enough to be close enough for you to hit him with an arrow.\n\nAnd you have to hit him now. You see a Grand Alliance soldier who just took a fatal blow to the chest begin to rise…\n\nNot many arrows left and not much time, you just load up and shoot, hoping you hit the bastard.\n\nYour shot is straight and true. It strikes the necromancer in the stomach, causing him to fall back, which in turn causes the undead horde to momentarily stop their vicious attacks, giving your side a chance to turn the tide a bit.\n\nThen you shoot another arrow when you see the necromancer attempt to get back up, which turns the tide completely in your favor. Zombies and skeletons fall. Ghouls flee at the loss of leadership and any remaining undead are quickly dispatched. You don’t take chances though. You walk up to the corpse of the necromancer and shoot your last arrow directly into his head and stab him a few times.\n\nYou then start laughing.\n\n“If this was the Great Lich Lord, I’d be a real hero right now!”\n\nYou quickly sober up from this macabre outburst when you hear shouting from some of your men and you look up.\n\nIt’s another horde. Just as big. You look behind you and see that your own numbers are completely insufficient. The Garwold citizens are either mostly dead or demoralized at this point.\n\nEven when you win…you lose.\n\nHaving no real options, you sound a retreat to fall back to the Zalan border and suggest that the Garwold citizens do likewise as there is nothing more for them here.\n\nThe Garwold Confederacy is now just one more loss for the living. The Zalan Empire won’t be far behind.\n\nThree years pass…\n\nTen years since the Nuro incident and The Grand Alliance is nearly just consisting of the Zalan Empire now, which in turn has had to adapt a siege mentality. There is no “going on the offensive” anymore. You’re purely on defense.\n\nYour brother Mallack died two years ago. Transferred to a location with more fighting due to lack of manpower. Like it matters. Didn’t even get to say goodbye. You can only hope he didn’t become one of those things…but you know he probably did.\n\nYou’ve been urging your family to run where it’s safer, but of course they won’t budge. The undead have been penetrating deeper into Zalan territory, you know it’s only a matter of time before the Great Lich Lord decides to stop toying with you and makes his full scale attack.\n\nSure enough it happens. Town after town is taken; you’re pushed back further and further, and you know there’s nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nAn order is given to everyone to fallback to the capital and help defend it from an upcoming attack, but at this point you’re just wondering if the rest of your family is still alive.\n","page 35":"Despite your fears, you’ve always had a sense of duty and responsibility, something that probably won’t ever completely go away due to how you grew up. You’re not running away, you did join to help provide for your family after all.\n\nBefore your company packs up and leaves Retlad, you write a quick letter to your family and hand it off to a messenger. Many of the Retlad citizens aren’t too pleased to see you leave, but they don’t really have any say in the matter, just like you don’t. There isn’t much talking on the trip, though, everyone is pretty silent. Wessel however is doing enough for everyone.\n\n“I can’t believe something like this happened! Nuro was a beacon of enlightenment and well prepared for situations like this! I…can’t believe this didn’t occur without some sort of demonic influence. I’ll bet that Mr. Demar had something to do with this! I remember taking his class and he was always a creepy bastard. Before I could graduate I had to take his conjuration 101 class and he didn’t like me because I had made several logical arguments to as why that branch of magic should be outlawed altogether. And it’s obvious by what happened recently that I was right! Nevertheless I did all the required work in the class and I still got a B! Way to fuck up my perfect record! I get the same grade as some bumbling idiot who summoned up a Nurk Beast that he lost control over and bit off someone’s hand! Where is the fucking justice?”\n\nOnce again, Wessel has turned the topic to focus on himself. Happily Captain Vahlat tells him to shut the fuck up.\n\nYou’ll be near Nuro soon and your company makes camp for the night. While all of you are on edge from what will come tomorrow, someone finally says something.\n\n“Hey farmboy, play us a song on that thing.”\n“…what did you want to hear?” you ask, not expecting to be called to play under these circumstances. In fact it just occurred to you that you’ve never played for anyone in your company! You assume that they all knew that you did, but they just were never interested enough to stick around and listen to you before.\n\n“I dunno, play whatever it was you used to play for the Retlad citizens…it seemed to make them happy.”\n\nYou pull out your lute and take a deep breath and start playing. At first you’re just concentrating on the strings and making sure you don’t mess anything up, but when you look up, you can see that everyone in the camp is listening intently to your music, even Wessel. Tensions seem to have decreased. It’s like a wave of calmness has struck the camp. You never believed your playing could have that much of an effect on people. Eventually the song ends and the Captain tells everyone who isn’t on watch to get some sleep. He then takes you aside.\n\n“Heard your playing…damn shame that you’re here. You really should be doing that instead.” Valhlat remarks.\n“I know.”\n“Hm. I know you joined mainly to help support your family.”\n“Yeah, I just hope I get to see them again.”\n“Bah, don’t start talking like that. I’ve seen you with a bow, you pluck that thing even better than that lute. You’ve been in battle before and survived, I see you doing it again.”\n“I sure hope so, its just I dunno…the undead…I’ve heard stories.”\n“Yeah, everyone’s heard the stories, but stories tend to be exaggerated. Now I dunno about what happened centuries ago, since I wasn’t there, but I HAVE fought the undead before. One of my first assignments was taking care of some minor undead incursion in a little village. Some asshole stumbled upon an ancient scroll and started reading the goddamn words on it out loud. They look a lot worse than they actually are. Most of the time they’re incredibly slow, and easily dispatched. Its mainly a psychological advantage from all the stories people have told about them that cause this quaking fear in most folks.”\n“Well I suppose, but what about the necromancers?”\n“Feh, they’re wizards and just like all the rest their arrogance is their undoing. Most of these so-called necromancers are half-assed ones that get killed by their own undead troops. Anyway, get to sleep; you want to be fully alert for tomorrow’s battle. It still won’t be a walk in the park, but it’s not going to be a death sentence.”\n\nYou take the Captain’s words into consideration, but in the back of your mind before you go to sleep, you’re thinking “But they can’t be that half-assed, they successfully took over Nuro…”\n\nThe next day arrives and you finish your trip to Nuro and that’s when you see the city for the first time. You always wanted to visit it after hearing about it from Wessel, but even from this distance it doesn’t look like anything he described.\n\n“By the gods…what…” Wessel slowly whispers.\n\nThe stench of death is thick in the air. You see thousands of bodies outside the city gates and they aren’t lying down either. They aren’t advancing either though. There just standing there like…well zombies.\n\nYour company isn’t the only one here though, there are a few others awaiting orders. You see one from the Brot Kingdom and another from the Azi Republic. Thankfully there’s another Zalan one as well to boost your numbers.\n\nThe respective captains acknowledge each other’s presence, a short meeting is made and then the inevitable comes. The attack.\n\nAt first things seem to go well. All ranged troops are ordered to fire upon the enemy who are still just standing there. Arrows pierce zombie brains, gunshots destroy skeleton bones, spells blast at walls and it seems very easy.\n\nThen from the battlements of Nuro a few figures begin casting a few offensive spells of their own. It’s at this point a charge is made towards the city.\n\n“When you get in range aim for the fucking wizards! Don’t fear these rotting meat sacks! We’re the fucking Zalan army! We don’t lose!” Captain Valhlat shouts.\n\nFine words, but they do little to uplift your impending sense of doom. It doesn’t help that the sky goes completely dark while you’re marching towards a bunch of undead and at the same time hoping you don’t get hit by a wizard’s spell. In the distance you briefly see a cleric from the Azi Republic riding a horse by himself. He appears to be calling upon some sort of holy might from whatever god he worships since a blue protective sphere appears around him. The next moment he’s hit by a black ray that goes straight through the sphere and his life is gone. Not even his god could protect him.\n\nAs you get closer, you see that the undead soldiers still haven’t moved, but there are significantly less of them as they continue to fall from ranged attacks. However, now other undead pop up on the walls of Nuro holding bows of their own.\n\n“SHIELDS!” Captain Valhlat shouts.\n\nMore of your side falls and now you’re so close you can smell the death in the air. The undead troops are now finally moving to do battle with your side. You attempt to target the robed figures on the battlements, but of course it’s very difficult in all this chaos and your fear.\n\nYou mostly only get the undead archers. Wessel is a little more successful is downing an enemy wizard.\n\n“Ha ha! Don’t you realize I graduated top of my class?!” you hear him shout.\n\nThe gates of Nuro are being broken down and despite the horror you’ve already seen, this battle still seems hopeful.\n\nThen a black cloaked hooded figure sudden appears on the battlements. You see him merely raise his arms briefly and that’s when you get the very real feeling that hope is lost.\n\nGhostly spirits come through the walls of Nuro making worse shrieks than when you fought the Quillars. At least they were living creatures. These drain lives at but a touch and there isn’t enough magic to fight the incorporeal creatures properly. You see the Brot Kingdom’s company break and run, but unfortunately for them and you, your possible retreat has been blocked. All the soldiers on your side that fell have now suddenly been raised, the undead soldiers that were killed have been raised as well. You’re fighting in the front, from behind and in some cases from within. It’s chaos.\n\n“Shit, I’m going to die today…” you whisper to yourself.\n\nCaptain Valhlat is knee deep in the dead, but this figure who’s apparently changed the tide of battle hasn’t escaped his attention. He points to the figure and barks orders at the top of his lungs.\n\n“KILL HIM! SHOOT THE FUCKER! DO IT! NOW!”\n","page 79":"Dear Mom,\n\nI’m still in Garwold and each day I see more of this once beautiful land die under the hordes of the Great Lich Lord. I wish I could’ve seen this place before all of this. I think I probably could’ve made a living here as a bard under different circumstances. Playing for the downtrodden militias and fleeing refugees during the few free moments is one of the few pleasures I get anymore.\n\nWe’re expecting a big undead push soon, and I don’t see how we can hold on to the remaining territory we have left here.\n\nI know you probably won’t, but if we lose Garwold, I want you and the rest of the family to SERIOUSLY consider abandoning the farm. It’s not even ours anymore. Why stay there in the face of oncoming danger?\n\nBut I know you’ll probably stay regardless. Maybe it doesn’t matter, because at this point where is there to run?\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son\n","page 34":"You don’t want to die and you know if you go, you will. You regret that you won’t be able to help your family out financially anymore, but you really don’t want to die.\n\nYou pack up all your stuff in the middle of the night and sneak away from the town your company is stationed in. You figure their orders are urgent enough that your desertion won’t immediately cause a full scale hunt, at least not by them.\n\nThe first order of business is to change your identity as much as you can. And head to a place where you can play for an audience, but the probability of someone ratting you out is low if you’re recognized.\n\nThe question though is where to go. You can’t linger in the Retlad Kingdom too long, in fact you’ll probably have to move around.\n\nYou decide your first stop will be at the Garwold Confederacy. It’s a relatively peaceful nation made up mostly of Halflings and Gnomes, with lush green fields and flowers. They tend to stay out of wars and they’re also known to appreciate the simpler things in life.\n\nEventually you make a place for yourself there in one of the small villages. You make a living playing at the local tavern there. Most of the patrons sense that you have some sort of past that you’re trying to hide from. But just like you thought, they don’t bring it up or say anything about it and just enjoy your music.\n\nA few months pass and you’re happy. You even meet a pretty Halfling girl to be with, and now you’re even thinking about just settling down here, since nobody’s come looking for you; however there are alarming events occurring in the rest of the world.\n\nThe assault on Nuro was a complete failure. Everyone was killed from your company. It makes you glad you didn’t go, but the fact that there is now an undead city state has everyone worried. It doesn’t help that there was also an outbreak of demons. One particularly nasty one called Velzix has conquered the Tulan Kingdom.\n\nDue to these events a Grand Alliance of nations has been created to stop these threats. The Garwold Confederacy normally stays out of such things, but they have agreed to send a militia as part of the aiding effort.\n\nYou don’t worry too much about it at first, but as a couple more years go on, the war gets worse and more and more Zalan Empire troops are passing through the area. Normally you’d move on, but now you’re married and you can’t bear to abandon yet another one you love. You still haven’t completely forgiven yourself for the first time.\n\nYou attempt to keep a low profile, but one day a Grand Alliance solider passing through, sees you in a tavern and recognizes you. Apparently he’s a citizen of Retlad and remembers you when you were stationed there.\n\n“HEY! I know you! Man, it’s good to see ya! How did you get out of the army? I thought the Zalan Empire had a twenty year requirement plan! You still play that lute really well?” he bellows for all inside to hear. Unfortunately one of the other Grand Alliance members with him is from the Zalan Empire who’s a real stickler for rules and regulations.\n“I know who you are too! You’re wanted for desertion! I’m placing you under arrest!”\n\nYou try to escape, but you don’t get far. You haven’t been keeping up on your physical training since you deserted, and coupled with your Halfling wife’s rich cooking you’re not in great shape anymore. The Zalan soldier on the other hand has been battle hardened in the recent months. He easily catches you and beats you into submission.\n\nYou’re taken back to the Zalan Empire in chains much to the protest of your wife, but its no use, you’re going to trial.\n\nYour family is made aware of your discovery, but none of them come to try to help you. You abandoned them long ago and didn’t even try to contact them; as far as they’re concerned you died years ago. You attempt to explain things in letters to them, but you’re never answered. Eventually you give up.\n\nThe trial is brief and the judgment final. You’re sentenced to death as an example of all those who would attempt to desert their duty during war.\n\nAs you sit in your cell counting the days for your hanging, you find out from sad visits from your wife that things are getting really bad. Dead armies conquering kingdoms, demons running amok. You almost wonder if your execution isn’t a blessing from the horror that seems to be eclipsing the world.\n\nThe day comes when the noose is placed around your neck…\n\n“Any last words?”\n\nYou have none; you just hum a little tune and close your eyes before the trapdoor swings open, and your neck snaps.\n","page 78":"Dear Mom,\n\nWell I’m sure you’ve heard by now that I’m officially part of the Grand Alliance. I don’t know just how to feel about it either.\n\nHow I even got roped into it, is all by chance and luck. That seems to be a staple in my life. I tried to desert the army once and I ended up getting promoted. I do it again, and even get called on it and I get even more responsibility! The world has gone completely mad. I’m sure of it now. Though who knows for how long. The woman responsible for putting me in my new position says we’re going to win, but as each day wears on, I lose faith that we will. I’ve gotten over my fear of death and the undead, but now it’s been replaced by a numbness to it. I don’t know if that’s worse.\n\nI heard about Mallack getting drafted. I sure hope he’ll be okay. And I hope you’ll be able to manage the farm without him, but I guess you’ll be alright now that the government has taken control of the farm. I really wish that hadn’t happened, but what can we do right? At least you won’t need to protect the livestock anymore with all the guard patrolling it though. It would seem the Zalan Empire is everywhere nowadays though. Well, everywhere there isn’t undead of course.\n\nWe’re going to try to retake the Brot Kingdom soon, dunno if it’ll be successful.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son\n","page 37":"Hey Mallack!\n\nI paid the messenger a little extra to give this one to you personally, don’t show it to Mom or anyone else! I’m serious!\n\nI finally did it!\n\nI didn’t even expect it either. I was off duty and taking a break from destroying a Quillar lair, so as usual I went down to the tavern to go play for the locals a bit.\n\nWhile it is true there have been several “offers” from some of tavern girls before due to my lute playing ability, I dunno I just never felt comfortable about going with one of them.\n\nHowever, I didn’t get to the tavern; I bumped into some traveling merchant woman from the Brot Kingdom. I apologized and helped pick up her belongings and she noticed the lute I carried. She began to ask me about it since she said she really liked music and soon the pair of us were deep in conversation and going back to the Inn on the other side of town that she was currently staying at. I learned that her name was Helena.\n\nWe continued to talk in her room and I played for Helena a bit and before I knew it, we were on the bed naked!\n\nI’m still not exactly sure how it started, but it sure felt good! I really liked her too, but I guess it was just a one time thing, because she left a couple days later. Though she did say if I was ever stationed in Brot, I should look her up again.\n\nAnyway, I guess I felt like I just had to tell someone. I suppose I could’ve told the guys in my company, but I didn’t really want to be sweated down for more detailed information constantly.\n\nOkay that’s it, and like I said, don’t show this to Mom or anyone else! In fact you should probably just destroy it.\n\nYour brother\n","page 36":"Dear Mom,\n\nThis assignment is almost coming to a close I believe. We’ve got the Quillars on the run and wiped out most of their lairs. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I’d rather be fighting Kobolds!\n\nLately I’ve been able to play a lot more thanks to our severe lowering of the Quillar population. The people here are pretty nice, they seem to always want me to play for them. Didn’t think I’d actually ever play for a proper audience!\n\nI’m happy to do it though, it sort of keeps my mind off of the nastier things I’ve seen. I know I told you about how my friend Tylir died, a few months ago, but it still seems a little unreal. I mean other than Dad, I’ve never known anyone who I knew personally dying. And certainly not as violently as he did. I’ve seen a lot more violence in general though.\n\nHowever, I guess I should’ve expected stuff like this to happen. I mean I am in the army! Sometimes the people call us heroes and stuff for killing the Quillars. Some guys like that annoying Wessel get a thrill out of it, but I dunno. I don’t really feel like one.

Even Wessel’s spell dissipates before it.\n\nNow you see that all hope is lost and you attempt to escape, but the precious few seconds you spent aiming your bow on a fruitless killing attempt has resulted in you being surrounded and overwhelmed.\n\nYou feel the rusty steel of a sword plunge into your side, followed by extreme pain. You turn to strike down the grinning skeleton warrior who’s just limited your life span. You strike a couple more corpses before you’re brought down by an axe to the skull, splitting your head open and causing your brains to leak out uselessly into the now blood soaked battlefield.\n\nYou fall and die, only to rise again as just another zombie drone for the growing undead army.\n","page 71":"As much as you still want to help out your family, you have to live your own life while there is still time.

Nobody from the Zalan Empire comes looking for you, as it’s assumed you’re dead and everyone’s too busy fighting the undead for the most part. When the Grand Alliance armies pass through, you keep a low profile though. You even meet a pretty Halfling girl to be with.\n\nThe next year isn’t so pretty however. The Great Lich Lord’s armies have been defeating the Grand Alliance’s attempts to stop them and now those armies finally turn their attention to the Garwold Confederacy.\n\nWithin a month half of Garwold has been turned into a graveyard. The Grand Alliance as well as the Garwold militia have been doing their best, but it’s not going to be enough. You help defend the little village that you’ve made your home in and you can’t afford to keep a low profile anymore despite the Grand Alliance presence (Which is now mainly made up of Zalan Empire troops) but it hardly matters at this point. Survival of the living is\n\nYou make plans to leave, and to try to convince your girlfriend and your other new friends that you’ve made here to leave as well. You know they’re all very home bound, but tomorrow you’re going to really try.\n\nUnfortunately a group of Blood Specters attacks the village that night. You awaken to hear blood curling screams ring throughout the village. You look out the window and see the vile red ghosts stalking the streets.\n\nYou’ve become too attached to these people to not help; you immediately grab your weapons and prepare for battle.\n\nYou head to your girlfriend’s home first, but sadly she’s already been killed and completely drained of blood. You don’t have time to morn as you’re immediately attacked by the Blood Specter that was still lingering in the house. You manage to kill it with a couple silver arrows, but its dying shrieks alert others to your area.\n\nYou slay a couple more of them as you try to look for the necromancer who has to be in the area to even control these creatures, but you can’t keep your eye on all the incorporeal creatures and you suddenly feel a slight pain in your back which reaches forward into your heart as one of them thrusts its hand into you to drain your blood.\n\nYou collapse soon after, only to rise later to join the ranks of the ever growing undead armies.\n","page 70":"Now you have to figure out a plan that’s going to prevent you from getting executed. You figure your brother’s plan isn’t exactly a bad one. Your record is good enough that you’d probably be believed. You think up a lie explaining that you were captured by a particularly sadistic vampire who was planning on draining you slowly to keep you as ongoing food. He took you to a cave in the hills where you barely killed him and escaped with your life. You would’ve made your way back sooner, but there were large groups of marauding orc raiders and demons escaping the ruins of the former Tulan kingdom that caused you to be extra cautious and forced you to hide for a few days.\n\nYep, that sounds good. You head out with the plan of meeting up with Captain Eckard’s company which is surely at the Tulan Kingdom now.\n\nEventually you reach the same town you were at when you made your decision to try to leave. You find it occupied right now, it’s not your company, so you’re about to press on, but someone on patrol sees you.\n\n“HALT! Where are you supposed to be soldier?!”\n“Oh…uh…” you say getting caught off guard. You mentally curse yourself for not being more aware.\n“Speak up! Wow, you look a little worse for wear…what company are you with?”\n“I was with Captain Eckard…but…”\n\n“Captain Eckard’s company? Holy shit! We thought they all got killed! The undead reached the Tulan capital first and ambushed them! But why am I telling you? You were there! You must’ve just barely escaped! Don’t worry; you can avenge your friends, we’re gathering strength to attack soon!”\n\nYou don’t believe this…\n\nThe guard begins speaking to you excitedly and asking you how you escaped. You just continue to say you don’t know, it all became a blur when the ambush occurred and how you attempted to fight, but it was just too much. The guard sympathizes and tells you that you can explain more to his captain. You notice he isn’t wearing Zalan armor, he’s wearing Azi Republic armor. You can only assume that perhaps this is a Grand Alliance company.\n\nYour ideas come true when you do indeed notice several kinds of troop types, though the Zalan Empire soldiers seem to be leading, as the captain is wearing the armor. Your heart sinks when you recognize her and she recognizes you. It was years ago, but you both remember.\n\n“…what are you doing here?” the female captain asks. “Last I heard you were in Captain Eckard’s company. A company that was reported to be wiped out completely. Have you managed to avoid death once again? You are the lucky one aren’t you?”\n\nSuddenly surrounding soldiers start to recognize you more closely. The Zalan ones especially.\n\n“Holy shit it’s him! You fuckin’ survived not one but TWO overwhelming undead hordes! We gotta take him captain, he’s obviously good luck!” the guard says a little misguidedly.\n“Good luck? If you haven’t noticed, only HE seems to be getting out alive on these things! I’d say he’s bad luck!” someone else says.\n“Nonsense! I heard how he’s killed countless demons with his bow! We could use someone like that in our next attack.” another says.\n“Isn’t he the guy that plays the lute really well?”\n\nA few people start arguing until the female captain speaks again.\n\n“ENOUGH! I’ll handle this. You in my office now, I’ll speak with you in private. And for the rest of you, get ready to move out. We’re attacking tomorrow.”\n\nShe turns away and enters a building; you slowly follow, while everyone else disperses.\n\nWhen you enter the wrecked “office” she closes the door and tells you to sit down, but she doesn’t. Instead she stares at you hard at you and draws her sword.\n\n“Okay Mr. Survivor. Convince me.”\n“Convince you of what?”\n“Convince me that you aren’t some fucking undead spy!”\n“WHAT?! How? I mean…”\n“Easy! In the two encounters you had with the undead on any major scale, you’ve been the only one to survive. Once, maybe. But twice? Mighty suspicious…”\n“But I mean…I’m not undead! Look I even walk around in the daylight, I’m not even pale!”\n“I didn’t say you were undead, I said you were a spy. There are few of those misguided traitors that think their necromancer overlords will be kind to them, by killing them last. Madness.”\n“But I’m not a spy! I killed…” you begin to stutter under pressure.\n”Yeah, yeah, you killed demons. Big deal. The undead and demons weren’t friends either. What better way to be a spy than to make yourself a hero?”\n“But I’m not…”\n“You’re not what?”\n“I’m not…”\n“What? More lies? Spit out the truth spy!” she demands pointing her sword at your throat.\n","page 73":"You can’t take it anymore.\n\n“I’M NOT A FUCKING HERO! OKAY!? I NEVER WAS AND I NEVER WANTED TO BE! (sob)… I just wanted to go home…(sob)”\n\nYou weep for a few minutes before the captain speaks again.\n\n“Alright then what happened? Tell me the entire truth and maybe you’ll avoid the executioner’s axe.”\n\nAt this point you have little choice. You’re too distraught to say anything else. You give a relatively condensed version of what happened. At Nuro and what happened recently. Your encounter with Warnov seems to surprise her quite a bit. You also go on to explain that it was high ranking Zalan officers that insisted on this hero nonsense. She believes you, like she knows something of it.\n\n“(sigh) Yeah there’s a statue of my dad in the Zalan capitol…but I know better…”\n\nYou don’t question anymore about this quiet outburst from her since you’re still too worried about what’s going to happen to you.\n\n“So why did you come back? You probably could’ve gotten away with it.”\n“The same reason why I joined. My family. I guess I just needed a reminder of that first hand. And if there’s any hope of changing the tide of this war with the undead then I need to stand by my decision of joining the Zalan Army and making the world safer for them.”\n\nOnce again the captain seems to soften. She almost looks like she’s going to tear up as well, but she turns away.\n\n“My family…I…” are all she says before taking a deep breath and turning back towards you, with a serious mindset again.\n\n“Alright, I shall trust your word for now sergeant, but I will be watching you VERY carefully! Consider yourself lucky for evading death once again, perhaps you do have knack for avoiding it. Let us hope that luck rubs off on the rest of us in the upcoming battle. I’m putting you in charge of the Retlad archery platoon. They’ll probably like you. Dismissed.”\n\nBefore you leave she says one last thing.\n\n“And sergeant, don’t listen to what that bizarre vampire said. We’re not going to become extinct. We’re going to win and survive a long time. Besides you still have to play that song for me.”\n\nAs you leave you feel a sigh of relief that you won’t be dying just yet, but given that you’re heading into battle soon with the undead, you’re wondering if you just didn’t postpone the inevitable.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nSeven years since the Nuro Incident changed the world into this living hell.\n\nYour time served in the Grand Alliance has not really changed much. The Grand Alliance and the Zalan Empire are basically one of the same now thanks to the complete embrace of a totalitarian system. Might makes right. Nations like the Azi Republic protested, but there was little that they could, after all Zalan has been practically defending the world by itself for the past few years. You get the impression that if this war is won; the Zalan Empire is going to throw its hat in to be a one world government.\n\nAmazing how power and conspiracy is plotted even when it probably won’t happen. “Probably won’t” because your superiors and political leaders are a lot more “optimistic” about winning than you are, but then they haven’t had to face the horrors you’ve faced.\n\nAnd horrors are a completely accurate word. You’ve gotten over your fear of the undead, but it doesn’t make it any easier. You’re starting to lose ground. Everyday the living lose someone, the Great Lich Lord gains. It’s a question of numbers and quite frankly your side doesn’t have them.\n\nYou sort of wish your old captain was here. She was a very good leader and inspirational, but then again that’s why she was made a general and sent elsewhere. She asked you to play that song before she left though. Somehow it seemed to make her sadder afterwards.\n\n“Captain, undead are on the move, they won’t be long now.” One of your messengers says.\n“Yes, I can sense it. Here. You head back to my home. You know where it is by now, and give this message to my family. If you get back here and see undead, well get the fuck out and run back to Zalan territory.”\n\nBeing a captain hasn’t really turned you into a copy of the captains you served in the past, but then again you didn’t even think you’d ever be promoted to one. Your reign as one has been a little unorthodox as you’ve applied more guerilla tactics than traditional ones, but given your assignment and your background it makes a hell of a lot more sense.\n\nYou’re currently stationed on what remains of the Garwold Confederacy. It was a relatively peaceful nation made up mostly of Halflings and Gnomes, with lush green fields and flowers. Now it’s just slowly becoming another massive graveyard and example of genocide.\n\nYou’ve gotten to know quite a few of them and you’re always amazed of how they can keep their sense of humor in the face of utter destruction. One of them actually gives you an answer.\n\n“To keep from crying.”\n\nIndeed. You’ve been playing quite a bit when you’re not battling the undead. (The Garwold citizens enjoy your playing a lot) It’s gotten to the point where you don’t just play anymore to keep your mind off of things, it’s like it transports you to a different world. A better world.\n\nIf only.\n\nYou often wonder how your brother Mallack is doing. He’s been stationed in a relatively safer location back in Zalan territory. You’re guessing that it lowers the odds of having your mom lose both of her sons at the same time. Like it makes it any better if she lost them within any length on time of each other. You wonder if the war is going to go on long enough that by the time Calwin grows up he’ll be drafted as well.\n\nIf he even gets the chance to grow up.\n\nYou can’t think about it now. A massive undead horde is coming and there’s no where left to hide. There will be open battle and you need to stay focused.\n\nYou go through the whole order thing, and making sure your strategy is sound. You wish you had more wizards, but they seem to be in shorter supply these days. It’s almost like they’re being targeted deliberately sometimes…actually you don’t think it, you KNOW that they are.\n\nYou see the undead horde approach. You look through some new fangled dwarven invention called an eye piece and see something makes your job a hell of a lot worse.\n\nYou don’t just see the usual undead. You see fully armored Death Knights. Harder to kill than even a zombie giant. You see Blood Specters. Dark crimson spirits that can cause their victims to bleed from every orifice with their shrieks. Both of those are at the head of this horde, and this isn’t even counting that you’re severely outnumbered by just the regular zombies, skeletons, ghosts and the like.\n","page 31":"Just because he’s acting reckless doesn’t mean you’re going to, you’re going to play upon your strengths and keep as far away as you can.\n\nYou ride your horse around the outskirts of the village, readying your bow the whole time. When you can, you fire at the Quillar attackers. As quick as they are, they aren’t really paying attention to you and you manage to get in some good shots. A couple of head shots even.\n\nAt first they don’t realize where the all the arrows are coming from, since Wessel is giving them a hard enough time with the chain lightning. You’re sort of glad you decided to stay on the outskirts. Wessel is having such a “good time” blasting the Quillars, he’s probably causing a lot more collateral damage in the process.\n\nEventually the Quillars start to retreat. This is when you get into a little more trouble as you happen to be right in the direction of where they’re running! They still look scary and they get even moreso as they get closer. The worst has to be their shrieks. It’s unpleasant to hear to say the least.\n\nYou ride out of the way, but your horse isn’t fast enough and is peppered by quills. You catch a few in the leg yourself and you’re thrown from the horse as it reels in pain, before collapsing.\n\nFeeling the pain you scramble for cover behind a nearby rock. Fortunately the quills don’t penetrate that. Most of them are content on just running away, but one straggler decides to try to get one more kill before leaving. That kill of course happens to be you.\n\nThe Quillar makes its high pitch shriek as it runs towards the rock. You don’t have time to ready your bow before its high jumped over the rock and on the other side of you. You quickly draw your weapon and swing it blindly as you turn around. Luckily your blade catches the side of its head, killing it. At last you collapse from the pain in your leg.\n\nWhile you’re pulling out quills, Wessel and another Zalan soldier come to meet you. Wessel doesn’t look any worse for wear, but the soldier looks very tired and obviously has wounds of his own.\n\n“There you are, lying down on the job I see.” Wessel mocks.\n“Are you alright?” the other soldier asks.\n“Yeah…Agh. I’ve gotten bitten in the leg by a Kobold before. Feels nearly the same except these quills go in a lot deeper.”\n“Glad you guys came when you did. We were just doing a routine patrol when these quill bastards came out of nowhere! They’re getting bolder and attacking in greater number, we need more reinforcements.”\n“Yeah, well good luck with that. The Tulan border is the primary concern. Besides I’m here now, I predict that this infestation will be over soon now.” Wessel boasts.\n\n“Any…way. My name’s Tylir. I’d introduce you to the rest of my squad, but they’re all dead now. Even though it was the heat of battle, I couldn’t help notice how well you picked off several of those Quillars with one shot. That was pretty impressive.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Hey! What about me? I’m the one who noticed you getting attacked in the first place! I’m also the one who saved your ass!” Wessel interrupts again, he’s starting to get annoying at this point, but Tylir doesn’t seem bothered by him.\n\n“Everyone did their part. Okay, since I’m here I’ll take you to see Captain Vhalat, I’m sure that’s who you were sent to report to, oh and wizard while your skills may be appreciated here, I’d advise you to cut down on the boasting. Captain Vhalat isn’t fond of it, and to be quite honest the other two wizards we had here were more experienced and they still got killed.”\n“Hmm, well perhaps they lacked the natural skill that I of course possess.”\n\nAt this point you and Tylir just roll your eyes and get moving.\n\nYou travel through a couple of other villages and it’s pretty depressing. You see stacks of bodies being buried in mass graves while most of other Retlad citizens look thoroughly defeated. A few look in your direction, but don’t look too much, it’s like they don’t really expect you to succeed. Not exactly inspiring.\n\nSoon you arrive in the town of Glaf. It would appear that the Zalan contingency sent here is staying in one of the bigger Retlad towns rather than the capitol. Ryan also says that the Quillar infestation is worse around here too, so the captain suspects that whatever lair they’re crawling out of is nearby and can hopefully located and cleansed.\n\nThe town itself resembles a small Zalan fort rather than a proper Retlad town, as a sturdy wall has been erected around it. The people seem to look a little more hopeful though. Tylir goes on to say that he thinks that the Retlad citizens are actually starting to prefer Zalan presence especially since their on government has been pretty ineffectual about the whole invasion. The Retlad army has only focused on defending the capitol. The Retlad royals appear to find their lives more important than anyone else’s.\n\nEventually you’re brought before Captain Vahlat himself. He looks up from the map he’s inspecting and addresses you and Wessel.\n\n“Ah, I see the Empire has seen fit to send me reinforcements…wow, twice as many as I thought I’d get. Private Tylir where’s the rest of your squad?”\n“Um…dead sir.”\n“Of course. (sigh) So what’s your problem private? Why is your leg wrapped up?” Vahlat asks you.\n“Got into a fight with the Quillars sir.” You answer.\n“Oh?”\n\nTylir at this point interrupts and tells of what happened. Wessel looks like he wants to expand upon his deeds, but Vahlat’s appearance is a little imposing and he was already warned once, so he keeps his mouth shut. Vahlat soon addresses you again.\n\n“Well it would seem you two have already proven yourselves useful. A lot more useful that what passes for the Retlad army, but of course that isn’t hard. Wizard, I certainly hope you don’t intend to use this place as a chance to show off all the skills you learned in your fancy Nuro college. One of your predecessors did that as well, and as you can see he’s no longer here. As for you, I hope that you can do a better job of keeping out of the way of the quills next time. Most don’t get a second chance. Alright that’s all for now. Our group is being housed for free at the Inn down the street. Free food as well, but don’t go overboard, its being rationed. You want more food or anything else you’ll have to pay like everyone else. I suggest though that you don’t do any heavy carousing. This is a high alert situation and we could be going to battle at anytime. Dismissed.”\n\nYou, Wessel and Tylir all leave at this point. Tylir goes on to show you where the Inn is and a couple of other places, but after today you just want to rest and retire to your room early. You rest your leg and begin practicing your lute. This puts you in better spirits.\n\n6 months pass…\n\nThe Quillar invasion has nearly been eradicated. Most of the major lairs have been located and cleansed and you certainly contributed greatly to this effort. Besides your combat abilities, your tracking skills definitely came in handy a lot.\n\nYou’ve become somewhat recognized among Retlad citizens due to your actions and the lives you’ve saved. The word “hero” has been used a few times though you definitely don’t think of yourself as one. In your free time you spoke with the citizens, a lot more than your fellow soldiers though. A few of them even convinced you to play for them when they noticed your lute. It took a little prodding, but eventually you gave in fully expecting to get booed, but to your surprise, you got applauded instead. Your playing didn’t just boost your spirits it seemed. Whenever you could you played a little bit for people in what little free time you had. Never did you think that you’d be playing for any kind of audience, let alone an appreciative one.\n\nIt definitely hasn’t been all sunshine though; you’ve seen a lot of people die. More than you ever wanted to actually. You’d made friends with Tylir shortly after your first meeting and he died only a couple months later. You’ll be glad when every one of these Quillar creatures are all dead though, all they’ve done is cause misery.\n\nYou’ve got them on the run now though. You’re preparing for an attack on another one of their lairs, when Captain Vahlat calls everyone to see him, he doesn’t look enthusiastic about whatever it is he has to tell you.\n\n“All right I’ll be brief. As much as I hate leaving a mission unfinished, we’re getting pulled out of here effective immediately. Major news is that Nuro has undergone a fucking disaster that needs to be put down like yesterday! All governments friendly to the City State of Nuro that can spare the manpower are to send help. We would be one of those. I hope the Retlad army is just competent enough to finish up what we started in their own country.”\n\nWessel immediately pipes up upon hearing about this revelation.\n\n“What happened in Nuro? What’s going on?!”\n“What’s going on? From what I’ve been told a whole bunch of your kind raised a shitload of undead and unleashed a bunch of hostile demons on the place! The entire city was overrun. Reports are already stating that small packs of demons are running around the nearby countryside. Most likely in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom. Not sure what that means with our border war with them, but I only see it getting bloodier around there. In any case, our job is to head to Nuro, before the undead start following suit. I hope you’re all ready for this, because this is going to be a lot different that fighting Quillars.”\n\nYou look around and see a lot of fear wash over faces and rightly so. Necromancers have a bad history on your world. When you were little you still remember hearing the tales of the Great Lich Lord that existed centuries before you were even born. He almost took over the world. Those stories gave you nightmares as a kid. The possibility of having to face something remotely similar even on much smaller scale doesn’t make you feel too well.\n","page 30":"This reckless idiot is probably going to get himself killed if you don’t stick by his side. You ride quickly to catch up with him in the village, and draw your bow.\n\nSurprisingly for your first battle, you manage to keep calm and focused on the enemy. Hard to do considering the Quillars aren’t the easiest of foes. They’re quick and they’re firing their quills faster than you’re firing your bow.\n\nThe problem though isn’t the Quillars, its Wessel. He’s having such a “good time” blasting the Quillars, that he’s causing a lot more collateral damage in the process. During one of these moments, your own horse gets spooked by the incredibly close fireball blast and rears back causing you to fall off of it.\n\nYou’re still shaking the cobwebs when one of the Quillars unleashes more quills and hits you with several of them. You collapse in pain, as the Quillar charges at you. It doesn’t kill you though. Wessel makes sure of that when he throws a bolt of lightning at it.\n\nUnfortunately the Quillar happens to have grabbed you just as its hit by the lightning. Your current pain is increased severely as the electrical current passes through your body, but not for long and your fried body eventually stops its deaths throes.\n\nWessel has a hard time explaining that the other transfer was hit by “friendly” fire.\n","page 74":"Quickly remembering the lie you thought up on the way, you sputter it out with some stress.\n\n“I…I was captured by a vampire! A really fucking sadistic one! He killed my scouting party and took me to say he was going to drain me slowly for fun! He took me to some cave in the hills and it was only by luck that I managed to kill him and escape! I would’ve made my way back sooner, but their were large groups of marauding orc raiders and demons escaping the ruins of the former Tulan Kingdom, so I was extra cautious and…”\n\nAt this point the Captain bashes you in the head with the hilt of her sword. You fall off the chair and onto the floor.\n\n“LIAR! You expect me to believe this horse shit? I’ve had patrols going all through this area and there aren’t any orcs in the damn area. They all fled further north long ago and the remaining demons mostly ran to the west! Not to mention the closest hills have no caves! You obviously think so low of me that you thought you could fool me OR you’re just a complete idiot as well as a coward! Either way you haven’t convinced me, and you’re fit only for execution! You’re a deserter at best and a spy at worst!”\n\n“No…wait…” are your last words before the Captain severs your head from your body.\n","page 44":"Demons are a lot faster than the undead and you’re wounded, no way are you going to be able to outrun them. You turn around and draw your bow, trying to ignore your pain which is overriding any fear you have at this point. Your weakened state is causing you to have a hard time aiming.\n\n“Uh oh, better be careful, looks like this one is going to put up a fight. I’d say by his uniform that he’s a soldier.”\n“Hur hur. Good. Hey human, better stop wobbling if you’re going to aim that thing properly.”\n\nYou miss the demon completely.\n\n“Hah! You want me to walk slower human?”\n”You sure you should be playing with him like that? Don’t you remember what happened earlier today?”\n“Shut up! I told ya, that bitch musta had some magical powers because…OW!”\n\nYou hit the demon in the chest, but it doesn’t seem much damage. He pulls out the arrow and now begins to quicken his pace. The other demon starts to walk towards you as well.\n\n“See, I told you to pay attention.”\n“Bah! If this is the extent of what his little pig sticker can do, I’m not concerned. Hey human, don’t you know they’re doing great things with gunpower these days? RAAAAGH!”\n\nThe big demon suddenly charges you, and you let your arrow fly. Right in the eye.\n\n“Perfect.” You whisper.\n\nThe demon bellows, but it doesn’t slow him down. You narrowly dodge his charge. You roll on the ground and shoot two more arrows in his back. He turns around snarling and bellowing for your blood. More arrows fly into the creature, but at last the demon has reached you and smacks you to the ground. Your bow flies from your hand, and while crawling on the ground you try to draw your sword, but a crushing blow hits you on the back. This might’ve caused a lot more damage, but miraculously the lute that’s still in your pack “softens” the blow. The crunching of wood signifies that it’s broken though.\n\n“What the fuck, that’s a weird noise…what is this? HA HA HA! Hey! You gotta be shittin’ me! A fuckin’ lute? Check this out! He’s carrying a fuckin’ lute! What’s a fucking soldier doin’ with a lute?” the big demon shouts to his acquaintance while he holds up your broken instrument.\n“Don’t talk you idiot! LOOK OUT!” his acquaintance shouts, just as you recover long enough to shove your sword straight into the demon’s groin. You push the sword upward in an attempt to do more damage and you succeed. Blood is flying everywhere and the demon howls in pain from the grievous wound. You pull your sword out and then proceed to repeatedly stab the demon until it falls backwards on the ground, dead.\n\nYou’re exhausted; you used all your remaining strength killing the thing. Unfortunately the other demon grabs you by the scruff like a helpless kitten and lifts you up off the ground a few inches. He knocks your sword out of your hand and looks at his fallen comrade.\n“Hmm, can’t say I didn’t warn him. Oh well, more meat for me. This may hurt a lot…”\n\nFully expecting the death that you’ve managed to avoid for so long, you once again evade it when a gunshot rings out and part of the demon’s head splatters in your face. You’re dropped immediately. The demon’s body is still standing though.\n\n“Shoot the bastard again!” you hear a gruff voice shout and this time the next shot hits chest and the demon falls.\n\nYou lay motionless on the ground, looking up in the sky when your saviors come up to you. It’s a group of dwarves armed with gun powder weapons.\n\n“By the gods, get doc out here! We need to fix this man up! Hey lad, you’ll be alright, don’t worry…are you a Zalan soldier?” one of the dwarves asks you.\n“…yeah…Nuro…lost…all dead…” is all you utter before fall into unconsciousness.\n\nA few days pass before you’re somewhat back to a coherent state. You find yourself in a military outpost and at this point you don’t care. You’re just happy to be alive.\n\nIt would seem that during your escape from Nuro, you ran in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom, the dwarven scouts that found you were from a small neutral kingdom trying its best to stay out of the dispute between Tulan and Zalan, but the new threat of demons running all over the nearby countryside caused them to increase patrols. They fixed you up, but dropped you off at the closest Zalan Fort. The Zalan fort that you’re in right now is called Virtue and it’s on the Tulan border. It seems relatively calm though. Not at all what you thought it would be.\n\nWhen one of the healers comes in to check on you, you begin to ask questions which she tries to answer to get you up to speed.\n\nThe Tulan Kingdom is currently under attack from the demons now. They’ve been assaulting the place and even gaining help from some of the evil populace there. The demon citizens there have reverted back to their “bad behavior” and thrown their lot in with the invaders as well. That doesn’t surprise you. The Tulan Kingdom pulled back some of their military from the borders so the fighting hasn’t been as bad and Zalan’s made a little more progress during this time, but the military minds are being cautious not to over extend. There is extreme concern over the recent demon invasion, not to mention the incident at Nuro. Word has already spread about the unsuccessful siege there.\n\nThe healer also tells you that a few Zalan “high ups” are eager to speak to you soon, as they want to know what exactly happened at Nuro. You’re somewhat of an important survivor since as far as anyone knows; you were the only one to successfully escape that killing zone. There’s also talk of a “Grand Alliance” being created to counter these new threats.\n\nWhile the healer talks you end up drifting back to sleep wishing you could just escape it all.\n\nOne year passes…\n\nYou’re still at Fort Virtue and it doesn’t look like you’ll be leaving the army anytime soon.\n\nYou couldn’t have been more wrong on your belief that you’d get executed for cowardice. You got promoted to sergeant instead, which in light of the current situation, is nearly the same thing.\n\nYour promotion came after several Zalan officers spoke to you about Nuro. You even got a medal.\n\nStories and rumors creep around about how against all odds you survived an undead onslaught and fought off a bunch of demons as well. Your past “reputation” from your time in Retlad is exaggerated as well. It doesn’t help that the citizens there remember you and are all willing to add to the exaggeration.\n\nAll of these stories have been woven together in such an elaborate way to make you seem like some kind of hero most likely for propaganda purposes. And you know you’re not hero. In fact you try to explain you aren’t a hero to people, but they think you’re just being modest, eventually you give up.\n\nYour assignment at Virtue hasn’t been uneventful. There’s fighting, but now it’s mainly demon commanded enemies rather than Tulan ones. Some demon lord called Velzix killed the royalty there, completely conquered the area and made it his realm. The border war continues under new management except now it’s more than just a border that the enemy is looking to take. Your superior, Captain Eckard reminds you of Valhlat except with a different name. You suppose there is a certain “cookie cutter” that occurs within the Zalan army that causes people to act the same. You’ve briefly wondered if you ever make that rank, you’ll act the same way. You then usually laugh at the very fact that you ever would.\n\nFort Virtue hasn’t suffered a really bad attack yet, and it’s mostly skirmishes, but it’s like waiting for the other shoe to drop. You routinely go on patrols and give orders which you didn’t think you’d be good at, but you think back to how you used to order your brothers and sisters around and perhaps you always had a bit a leadership skill, you just didn’t want it.\n\nYou thought that you’d be able to at least visit your family, but of course due to recent events, you’re ordered to stay put. Your family at least is getting more money from your pay increase. They even send a new lute for you after you told them of the unfortunate event that resulted in the destruction of your last one. This gives you a little pleasure in a relatively joyless assignment.\n\nAll in all, you still prefer it compared to being in the unsuccessful assaults on Nuro. The Grand Alliance that was formed hasn’t been too successful as every one has been a slaughter from what you’ve heard. You already went through that once. You don’t relish the idea of going through it again.\n\nOne day while you’re spending your free time practicing a new song, some new soldiers come into the fort. They look like they’ve just seen a vicious battle and are here to restock. One of them sees you and gives you a disapproving look. It’s a woman with striking good looks, but definitely carrying an air of leadership about her. Her rank signifies her as a captain…yep same cookie cutter, just a little prettier.\n\n“You there! What are you doing playing an instrument? Shouldn’t you be on watch or doing something more constructive with your time soldier? And you’re a sergeant? You should know better!”\n“I’m not on watch duty right now and…”\n\nThe woman doesn’t even let you finish your explanation. Other soldiers that were sitting in your area are now slowly creeping out of the fray. Even her own soldiers are creeping away. They probably know all too well of how she acts.\n\n“So? You think evil is going to wait around for you to be ready for battle? Where is your superior officer? I can’t believe they would allow such a relaxed attitude around here considering the importance of this fort! If you were serving under me, I’d have you flogged for your lack of discipline!”\n","page 88":"This is probably the most satisfied you’ve been in a long time. Why bother running anymore? You’re not going to be any happier elsewhere as you eek out an existence. This is a place where you can play your music and have a regular appreciative audience. Perhaps the pixie illusion will fail, perhaps it won’t, but this is your home now.\n\n“Queet, I’m staying.”\n“That’s wonderful!” she squeaks.\n\nThe pixies go through with their plan of hiding the entire forest. They explain that for everyone else it will look like a rock mass and the magic shield will prevent entry in case someone bumps into the “rock”. Creatures inside will only see more forest outside the barrier and will probably be baffled to as why they can’t go any further, but will probably not make any serious attempt to do so even if they could.\n\nThe pixies also allow you to enter their little village. Naturally you’re much bigger, but a special arrangement is made so that you can stay nearby and they build you a tree-house of sorts and provide meals and drink for you.\n\nLife with the pixies full time is relatively nice. Of course a few are prone to play jokes on you sometimes, you don’t get mad about it and they usually make up for it later. A few years pass and it gets to the point where you almost forget about what’s going on outside the forest since almost everyday is a pixie party filled with merriment and music. There’s one particular time when there was a brief magical disturbance in the illusion, but the pixies managed to correct it. It does cause you to get concerned, but the pixies still insist that you not worry.\n\nAfter fifteen some odd years pass, the forest begins to signs of unnatural decay, and forest creatures seem to be dying way before their time.\n\nSome of the pixies have made comments of not feeling themselves, which is very odd since being fairy creatures they don’t normally get sick. You haven’t been feeling up to your usual standards either. You at first chalked it up to age, but you know that it’s more than that. The Great Lich Lord’s influence has finally penetrated the illusion. Death is creeping in.\n\nThe months pass and the illusion begins to break down despite attempts to keep it up. At last for the first time in years you see the “outside world” again. It’s desolate and bleak. The Great Lich Lord has been thorough in his conquest of the world and with this new found green patch, it won’t be long before it becomes as dead as the rest of the landscape.\n\nPerhaps because they’re magical creatures of nature, the pixies cannot withstand this death aura as well as you can, and they begin dying. Their illusions and happy lush world utterly destroyed.\n\n“Wh…why is this happening?” are Queet’s last delirious words before she expires.\n\nOne by one they all die. You weep as you can do nothing for them. Nobody can. Once again you’ve lost another family. You wish you’d left the damn forest long ago just so you hadn’t deluded yourself and gotten so attached to the pixies only to watch them die.\n\nHowever, you decide that this place will be your last stand as well and you’re too tired to run even if there was anywhere safe to run to anyway. You fight off undead creatures for a couple months as you attempt to survive in this now dying forest, but ultimately you’re overwhelmed and killed.\n\nSadly, unlike your pixie friends, you are not allowed to rest in peace as you wander the landscape in search of the last remnants of life to destroy in the Great Lich Lord’s service.\n","page 43":"Fear griping your heart, you struggle and push yourself to run as fast as you can in your condition.\n\nSoon something else is gripping your heart.\n\nYou look down at your chest and see your bloody still beating heart outside of where it is normally supposed to be. The demon fist holding it squeezes your heart a bit first before crushing it completely before your eyes. You die soon afterwards.\n\n“Hah! I told you I could reach him before he got to the rock!” the demon laughs as he lets his arm slide out of your dead slumping body.\n","page 46":"Shrugging your shoulders you point her in the direction of Captain Eckard to which she immediately marches off to. You don’t think anything will come of it though. You do your job and Eckard’s always been alright with you for the most part. At most you’ll get him yelling at you for getting into a conflict with a superior officer.\n\nYour thoughts are wrong however.\n\nWhen the female captain confronts Eckard, she and he end up getting into a greater argument. Apparently they’ve been minor rivals in the past and this “lack of discipline” displayed by you just fuels her arguments that he isn’t a fit for commanding a fort.\n\nShe eventually leaves in a huff with her men, but still arguing with Eckard and saying that she’ll see that he’s relieved of his command and replaced with someone more competent.\n\nCaptain Eckard is also now pissed at you for bringing this on him, he takes your lute away, breaks it and tells you that you won’t be playing anymore and if he catches you doing it again he’ll have you whipped.\n\nA few months pass as normal, but then the other boot finally drops. Whatever connections the female Captain had she’s used them, and Captain Eckard is demoted and transferred out of the fort along with some of the others who seemed to be “disciplinary problems”. Guess who’s name showed up on that list?\n\nYou’re all transferred to areas where the fighting is a lot worse. You are sent to the Nuro front much to your dismay. Once again you’re fighting hordes of undead on a mass scale. Never having fully gotten over your first conflict at Nuro, your nerves and well being in general is always on the verge of breaking with each skirmish and battle. You don’t even have your music to keep you in a calm state of mind anymore either. It’s actually amazing you survive.\n\nYou soon hear about how the Grand Alliance outsted a necromancer called Trelik from the Brot Kingdom. That makes you feel somewhat better, but that hopefulness is soon brought low when you hear about the successful attack on Brot that happens soon afterwards. A Necromancer from Nuro reportedly conquered the entire Kingdom with undead giants.\n\nYour morale is further lowered when you hear that your company is being sent to help the Grand Alliance take it back again.\n\nWhen you actually see the dead monstrosities, your fragile will shatters completely.\n\nWhen the battle commences, you’re just about useless in battle. Your dumb luck also runs out and you’re unable to fight or even retreat your way out of this one. The undead giants might be big, but they’re also faster than what they appear to be.\n\nOne of them charges into your company line which at this point is trying to get out of the way and swings his club striking several. You being among them.\n\nYou eventually land several feet away from the main part of the fighting, broken and bloody. You’re unable to move and just quietly moan in pain until you bleed out and die from your extensive wounds. You’re not even useful for the Necromancer to raise for his ever growing army.\n","page 89":"The pixies have almost made you forget about what’s really going on in the rest of the world…but you still know it’s going on. Perhaps it’s easier for them, as they have not had to experience the tragedies you’ve faced, but you know the destruction that’s eventually going to come. You don’t see any hope in their plan and if you stayed, and you still would never be able to completely relax. You could possibly be trapped as well.\n\nHowever, you have no wish to bring more despair to these people. Let them live in illusions for as long as they can,\n\nYou wish you could.\n\nIt is with great regret that you tell them that you cannot stay. They attempt to convince you to do otherwise, but you’ve already made up your mind. Finally they accept your decision, but insist on repaying you for all your musical entertainment. They give you a small magical amulet. They tell you it can make you invisible for short periods of time.\n\nYou thank them and assure them that it will most definitely come in handy.\n\nYou leave the forest and head further away from the undead plague.\n\nNine years pass…\n\nTwenty years of surviving this living hell.\n\nLiving in a cave in the mountains isn’t as easy as it was in the Pixie forest, but it’s probably a lot safer as far as undead are concerned. The biggest threats you’ve had to face are a few Cragmaws and Mountain Trolls. Once you ran into a couple of dwarves, so you assume that there may be an underground settlement somewhere in the area. You attempted to speak, but they just shot at you with their crossbows and told you to go away, saying that humans were the cause of the problem going on right now.\n\nYour use your amulet when you can as it seems that the living have been just as willing to kill you as the undead. Then again, that’s nothing new.\n\nEvery now and then you travel and scout around the area taking in the untainted countryside. You figure you should do it now before it’s claimed eventually. The living exist here, which means death can only eventually follow. You just wonder how long it will take.\n\nSometimes you walk along the shore that’s nearby. You look out past the vast blue and begin to wonder if there are any other places out there. You briefly entertain the idea of building a boat. You know that the globe was thoroughly charted centuries ago and that this is the only continent, but still you wonder if something wasn’t missed. Of course you’re probably just holding on to the false hope that you could theoretically go someplace else where death wasn’t everywhere.\n\nBut there isn’t such a place.\n\nLately something very odd has been happening and you have no idea what it is. You could swear that the landscape has been subtlety altering itself from time to time. Not permanently, but it seems to look “wavy” or “warped” briefly.\n\nYou initially chalk it up to your prolonged isolation and seeing things because of it, however you soon find out that it’s more than just your mind playing tricks on you.\n\nOne day after you’ve done some hunting and bringing your catch back to your cave, you start noticing a severe slow down in your actions.\n\n“What the fuck…” you say to yourself, except it comes out a lot slower. You don’t experience for long, but the worst is yet to come.\n\nA portal opens up in the sky and you immediately feel ill. You see a creature that you’ve never seen before and it’s huge but it feels incredibly unnatural and it definitely isn’t of this world. The dead animal that you’re carrying suddenly melts into a black goo like substance. You jump back and nearly fall off the side of the mountain, which now feels like jelly under your feet rather than sturdy rock.\n\nYou don’t know what’s going here and you don’t want to know. All you know is reality is starting to be seriously warped and you’re ready to puke.\n\nThe tentacled creature doesn’t seem to notice you, it’s just surveying and floating in the air as the area around and beneath it changes. That still doesn’t mean it won’t attack eventually when it does notice you.\n\nYou immediately attempt to use your amulet, but nothing is happening. The creature or something else is nullifying your magic item.\n\nRight now you’re caught out in the open, your cave is close, but you’re still not sure if you can get there in time and even if you do, would you be any safer? The other alternative is to make you way back down the mountain and try to escape that way. The problem with that plan is that everything is very wobbly right now and you’re not feeling very steady.\n","page 48":"Dear Mom,\n\nI dunno if they informed you, but I AM still alive! I don’t know how long you may have been worrying, but I’m sure you already heard about the failed siege at Nuro. It was horrible.\n\nI’ve spoken little about it as I’ve been attempting to recuperate in Fort Virtue. I really don’t want to, but I know I have to. Some of the high ranking people in the Zalan military apparently want to talk to me directly about it too. Apparently I was the only survivor. I still can’t believe it. I mean is it possible the god of luck rolled the dice and I was spared that day?\n\nIt’s the only possible explanation. I mean the dead were all around me and I somehow escaped. My troubles didn’t even end there, since I might’ve died of blood loss or marauding demons had I not been found by a Dwarven patrol.\n\nI’ve never seen so much death in my life even during my assignment in Retlad and I wish I didn’t have to again, but I know I will. I just wish I could get my mind on the awful things I saw that day. Normally I’d play my music, but I don’t even have my lute anymore to do that. I miss it.\n\nI can’t believe I’m even obsessing about a stupid instrument when I should really be thankful that I’m still alive! Nobody else is. Captain Valhlat, Wessel, all of them. All those people in my company are dead or worse, probably raised as zombies by now.\n\nI dread what the future holds. Will I be sent back?\n\nI wish I had my lute.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family\n\nYour son\n","page 47":"You’ve served in this army well and always done your job regardless of the shitty situations you’ve been in. You might not like a lot of it, but you’ve never complained. Lately you’ve been on edge about a possible all out assault of some big ass demon army that’s going to attack any day now, and playing is one of the few pleasures you have to put your mind at ease.\n\nPerhaps it’s a combination of this and a combination of this unwanted and unnecessary scolding that causes you to speak out of turn.\n\n“With all due respect ma’am, I am fully prepared to battle at a moment’s notice and so are those under my direct command. But even soldiers need to rest, if only for a minute.”\n\nThe woman looks very surprised you didn’t comply with her demand to see your superior officer.\n\n“…you DARE speak out of turn like that to me? I’ll see you sent to the Nuro Front for that sort of insubordination! Then we’d see just how battle ready you are! How would you like that?”\n“I wouldn’t like it at all. I barely survived the first time.” You say trying not to express any fear.\n“…What? What are you talking about? First time?”\n\nNow you’re a little surprised she doesn’t know who you are considering how some of the high ups exaggerated about how you managed to survive. You explain yourself briefly and she doesn’t quite believe you at first, a couple of your troops hiding nearby at least back up your claims before slinking off.\n\n“That was YOU? What the hell are you doing here? You should be leading from the front not languishing in some fort that barely sees battle!”\n“Doesn’t see battle? We suffered a small demon raid last week! We see plenty of battle!”\n“What I mean is, somebody of your obvious combat and survival skills should be assigned on the front lines where you can do more good. Normally I don’t question Zalan command, but this is really an oversight on their part.”\n“Well maybe they know better than the both of us, besides this assignment isn’t a walk in the fairy fields. I think we’ll be suffering a grand scale attack any day now.”\n“Doubt it. Velzix has been having a hard time keeping his unruly mob together. If it wasn’t for a lot of the sycophantic Tulan citizens, he’d probably be confined to pure defense, though something will have to be done soon, reports say he’s attempting to gate in more demons everyday. Not to mention that supposedly civilized demons from other nations are starting to display their true colors and flock to his banner. Like I always said the only good demon is a dead one!”\n\nThis causes you to smile a bit and she very faintly smiles back when she sees that you feel the same way. This smile disappears quickly though as she continues her rant.\n\n“I wish I wasn’t assigned to the Tulan Border though. I’d rather be taking Nuro back. THAT’S the more dangerous threat. The demons will kill themselves with their own chaotic and violent natures, but the undead…they’ve almost taken over the world before just because of one bastard that lead them. I never thought I’d see a serious threat like this in my lifetime, especially not…”\n\nThe female captain at this point stops. She even looks away from you as if whatever she was going to say was just too much even for her. She seems to be a lot more battle hardened than you and probably ten times braver. You can’t imagine what horror she experienced that would be worse than your own, but you don’t find out since she changes the subject.\n\n“…Bah! Maybe you’re right; a soldier does need to keep their mind occupied on other things every now and then. We aren’t undead after all. So what’s with the lute? You also a bard or something?” she laughs.\n“No, I think those dreams are long gone, but my playing seems to boost spirits around here a little, which can only be a good thing in this situation.”\n“Hm. My mother was elven and she used to sing this song to me and my…brother when we were very young. It was very smooth and calming. Beautiful melody.”\n“Yeah, most elven music is like that. When I was assigned in Retlad I learned a few elven songs from a few of the citizens there, you wouldn’t happen to know the song would you?”\n\nShe tells you the name of the song and you know it immediately. One of the first new songs you learned while stationed in Retlad actually. This seems cause her to momentarily revert to a less stand offish behavior. You’re about to play it for her, but then a messenger comes running up handing her a note. She reads it and she’s all business again.\n\n“Alright men! We’re moving out!” she shouts and leaves without saying another word to you. You didn’t even learn her name.\n\nPerhaps it’s just as well; you’ll most likely never meet again due to one of you dying on the battlefield. You go back to doing what you were doing.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nThree years since the Nuro Incident and this struggle still continues.\n\nYou’re still stationed Fort Virtue and you’ve repelled more demon attacks than you would care to count. Velzix has finally gotten his shit together completely. A unified demonic front is in full swing here and its taking its toll. Once again your skills have come in very handy in defense. You are certainly known as a demon slayer, but you still don’t feel like a hero of any kind. You’re just trying to do your job and survive. You save lives when you can, but you know ultimately it’s a futile task as death seems to be everywhere nowadays.\n\nAs bad as it is on the demon front, its nothing compared to what’ve you’ve heard on the undead front. The Necromancer has finally broken out from Nuro, and successfully attacked the Kingdom of Brot. Several undead giants demolished the area. You’ve never even seen a living giant and they sound intimidating. You can’t even imagine an undead one. The power to raise one, let alone several is sort of scary. The Grand Alliance army didn’t get there in time to stop him and as usual they were repelled when they arrived.\n\nYou worry about the Grand Alliance failing to stop the undead horde. You hope it doesn’t get any closer to the Zalan Empire where your family might be in danger.\n\nSometimes you worry so much that you can’t sleep, not that you do much of that nowadays anyway. Normally you play to keep your mind at ease, but tonight you go to the archery range to keep yourself focused.\n\nFor a long time you’re by yourself, but suddenly you feel a creeping suspicion someone is watching you…\n\nYou turn around with your bow and see a pale man. He holds up his hands.\n\n“Hey now! Don’t shoot! Sorry for creeping around like that. Professional habit.” He says.\n“What? Who are you?” you demand.\n“Warnov. Zalan Intelligence.”\n“You’re a spy?”\n“Well I suppose you could put it that way. I was here to give some info to your Captain Eckard, and I also wanted to take a look around the fort. Didn’t think anyone would be on the range though. Nice shooting, I know who you are and heard about your marksmanship with a bow. You’re certainly doing your part with the demons around here.”\n\nDespite the fact that you’re talking to a spy, you feel the need to vent your feelings.\n\n“Yeah, well I hope the Grand Alliance starts doing its part. I mean what the fuck are they doing? Weren’t they created to put a stop to all this shit? I mean am I supposed to worry every day if that undead horde is going to get closer to the Zalan Empire where it can threaten my family?”\n\nWarnov doesn’t look offended by your words, if anything he looks intrigued.\n\n“Well, I can understand why you’re venting. Trust me I sympathize. But as part of intel, I can tell you its not that easy…there were a lot of surprises that weren’t accounted for. We’re doing our best to rectify this situation by gathering as much info as possible. In fact, you could help us…”\n“Excuse me? How?”\n\nWarnov looks around and gets closer before speaking.\n\n“Look, as I said, I know all about you and your skills, why you joined, all of it. I know you don’t much care for some of the propaganda made about some of your exploits. But it’s important to realize that deeds like yours must be blown up a little to give common people hope that ultimately good will win the day. You may not consider yourself a hero of any kind, but your actions aren’t without some of those qualities. You obviously care very much about your family, and I’ve heard how you try to keep the people under your command alive. Sound like heroic qualities to me. Perhaps they’re on a smaller scale, but they’re there. I’m betting that there’s a BIGGER hero in there somewhere, just itching to get out. You think the Grand Alliance isn’t doing a good job? Perhaps we can arrange something for you to be transferred into it, or maybe you’d like to take an even more direct approach.”\n“What do you mean?”\n\nWarnov suddenly backs away.\n\n“Before we go any further. I need to know are you willing to take up the mantle of being a hero. Because if you aren’t, then we have nothing more to discuss. I shall require an answer now.”\n","page 49":"Dear Mom\n\nThanks for the lute! I received it just a few days ago. It plays very well, its even better than the one I lost. It’s certainly made what little free time I have at least tolerable now.\n\nI really wish I could get a chance to visit you guys though. I thought I would’ve been able to by now, but I suppose given the current situation, nobody’s getting any kind of leave for quite some time.\n\nI’m sure you’ve also heard all about how I’m supposed to be some kind of hero after surviving the failed attack on Nuro, but I don’t see how. I mean I guess praise is better than being insulted, but at this point I feel like a fraud. Like I’m getting too much credit for something that was pure luck in the first place.\n\nI dunno, I know you and the rest of the family are proud of me so that’s all that really matters. I’m just trying to keep all this in perspective. You and Dad always told me not to get a big head about things. At least they raised my pay so I can send you guys more money. That’s why I joined the first place after all.\n\nThis new rank gives me a few more responsibilities, but I can handle it. So far this assignment hasn’t been too bad. Demons aren’t a picnic to fight though and I’m dreading the day when they start attacking in a more organized manner.\n\nUntil then, I’ll just be enjoying your gift when I can.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son\n","page 82":"Really, it’s the only thing that makes any kind of sense anymore. This war is lost there’s not even any doubt about it. Hope is fleeting and if this is truly it, then it’s going to be with the ones you did this for in the first place.\n\nYour small groups of soldiers wonder where you’re going and you flat out tell them, in fact you tell them more than that.\n\n“I’m going home, and I suggest if any of you have any family you go to them as well. This is it folks, there’s no happy ending here. It’s been a pleasure serving with all of you.”\n\nYou then ride home as quickly as possible.\n\nThe farm is scattered with undead. They attack and in some cases eat the livestock, while attempting to get into your house. Dead Zalan soldiers can be seen, except they aren’t properly dead like they should be. The farmhouse is being attacked and you can see your sister firing her pistol at the zombies from one of the broken windows. You trample a couple of the zombies with your horse and kill couple more with your bow, but eventually you dismount and chop up the remaining ones near the farm house, since you want to save your arrows for anything potentially more dangerous.\n\n“Quick get inside through this window, the door is barricaded.” your sister Randi shouts when she sees you.\n“No! It’s a death trap to stay now! This place is lost! You all have to come with me!” you shout back, keeping an eye on the advancing zombies.\n“Can’t Mom’s hurt pretty bad. Got stabbed by one those corpses. We can’t move her. Help’s gotta come soon…”\n“NO, it won’t Randi! The capitol of Zalan is being attacked as we speak! I came home to get your guys! This is the fucking end! We’ve lost! We just gotta…”\n\nYou’re interrupted when you have to cut down an advancing zombie. Your sister fires a shot at another one. Suddenly a scream from the house is heard, followed by another. That has to be Calwin, and Makana. Randi rushes from the window and you cut down another zombie before bashing the door down with relative ease.\n\nMore screaming is heard along with growling this time. You look around and run down the hallway where Randi is standing motionless. She’s dropped her pistol.\n\nYou push her aside and see your other sister Makana dead on the floor and then a quick scan to the left and you see your mother eating Calwin.\n\nShe’s one of those things…\n\nYou act where Randi failed and give a killing blow to the thing that was once your mother.\n\n“I’m sorry.” You whisper and her blood splashes across your face.\n\nNow you’re ready to get the hell out of the house, but Randi is still standing there motionless.\n\n“COME ON! WE GOTTA GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!” you shout.\n“Yeah...okay…” Randi says and begins to move like she’s in slow motion and picks up her flintlock.\n\nYou run past Randi in the hallway who’s still moving slowly.\n\n“Randi get your ass mov…”\n\nYou hear a gunshot behind you. Followed by the slumping of a lifeless body. You don’t even turn around, you don’t want to see.\n\nWhen you get outside, surprisingly the undead haven’t become unmanageable yet, and you cut down another couple with relative ease. Your horse unfortunately has run off, you’re on foot from here.\n\nYou don’t even know where to go. Where is it going to be safe? Nowhere, but you lack any other ideas, so you just head for unclaimed wilderness.\n\nAfter about a day of running, hiding and maneuvering, you’re in a relatively safe location and that’s when you finally allow yourself to grieve for the loss of your family. You weep.\n\nYou’ve lost everything now. Everything you did was basically for them, and now they’re all gone. You don’t know if you can even continue. What would be the point? The world seems to be doomed anyway.\n\nBut then after you think about it, you decide that if death is taking over the world, you’re not going to make it easy. Death has already taken everything away from you except your life, and you’re going to hold on to that as long as possible. You’re going to live for your family and all the others that can’t any longer.\n\nYou’re going to survive, because ultimately that’s what you’ve always done. You’ve cheated death more than once already and you’ll continue to do it. Death itself is going to have to hunt you down if it wants your life.\n\nAfter reaching this conclusion, you try to think of where you should go next. Going to any type of centers of civilization is out of the question now. You’d only have to move again, them being targets now.\n\nSo it’s the life of wanderer now. The question is where would be best? The forests aren’t exactly safe, but you’re more familiar with surviving in them. The mountains might be a little safer, but living in them is going to be a lot harsher.\n","page 81":"Everything tells you that you should go to your family, but you question if they are even still alive. You don’t want to think about it really since it’s starting to upset you. The thought of your remaining family being killed and turned into undead parodies of themselves, makes you not want to know if that’s what happened.\n\nYou wonder if they might’ve even fled already like you’ve been telling them to in your letters. It’s certainly possible, even as stubborn as your Mom is, she might’ve taken your advice at least for the sake of the rest of your brother and sisters.\n\nYou mind suddenly goes elsewhere…\n\n…Yeah…they left already. There’s no point in going to your home. It’s been abandoned. They’re probably all safe in Retlad by now. No need to worry. You’ll see them later. Surely this attack on the capitol won’t be that bad. You’ve survived a lot worse. You’ve got orders and you need to follow them, because if there is any chance at stopping this dead plague, this is going to be a crucial battle. You did join the army to help your family after all, and what better way to help them, then to ensure their future?\n\nAfter having this little delusion, you feel calm again. Oddly so. Even a little hopeful. You head off to the capitol with your troops.\n\nWhen you get there, the general attitude is pessimistic. Most people don’t seem to think they’re going to win. You’re getting that vibe even from the generals of the Grand Alliance. You don’t see why. Surely the Great Lich Lord has finally overextended all his resources now. This attack will be a failure and from here you will be able to make a counter attack! Sure it won’t be easy, but it can be done.\n\nPeople are finding your optimism a little weird, especially those that have served under you since they know how that really isn’t your personality. You don’t think you’ve changed at all though. You just go about following your orders of making sure your troops are prepared in their defense of the south wall, humming little tunes as happy music fills your head.\n\nA few days pass and you’re visited by your old commanding officer who’s constantly making sure everything is in place. She looks very tired; you tell her she needs to think positive. When she asks if you’re feeling alright, you just laugh and ask if she’d like to hear a song.\n\nShe tells you no with a grim look. She also tells you point blank that she wants to get laid one last time before this battle. Being in the somewhat scattered mind frame that you’re in right now, you ask who the candidate is.\n\nA couple hours later, you have your answer. Before you leave her room, she asks you to play a song for her after all. It’s the one she asked to play before. The one her mother sang to her.\n\nAs you play she noticeably begins to weep. She doesn’t attempt to hide it. You stop playing and hold her until she calms down which eventually she does and composes herself.\n\nShe gives no further information and simply tells you to go back to your post and to carry on as if nothing happened. You do so without pressing the issue.\n\nA week passes and the undead horde arrives. It’s much bigger than anyone expected, and even worse, the Great Lich Lord himself is leading this attack.\n\nNow your mind suddenly comes back to grips with reality.\n\nThe undead horde surrounds and storms the city. An attempt is made to kill the Great Lich Lord, but he merely gets back up from the hail of gunfire and arrows that strike him.\n\nSoon the gates are compromised. You order your troops to take to the streets and fight off the invading hordes with the rest of the soldiers. You do likewise, though now you’re really wondering about a way to try to escape. Its no use though, the dead are everywhere butchering anything alive. You kill one walking corpse and five more take its place.\n\nIn one particular brutal sneak attack, a ghoul jumps from a rooftop and tackles you. You feel a paralyzing bite as it sinks its teeth into you. Darkness soon takes you and you begin you new mindless undead life afterwards.\n","page 40":"There’s undead all around you, fear coursing through your body and all you can think of is escape. You see a few others following orders, but their shots do nothing. Apparently the Necromancer has protected himself behind a more powerful magic shield than the cleric you saw die had. Even Wessel’s spell dissipates before it.\n\nYou ignore your orders, you ignore your fellow soldiers, you ignore the attack on Nuro, and you run and you’re not a bit ashamed to put your survival first.\n\nThe chaos of the fighting is bewildering and you don’t really pay attention to what direction you’re heading, you’re just making a beeline to any destination not completely filled with zombies, ghosts, and skeletons. You look back, only to see more death. The hooded figure on top of the battlements calls down some sort of death cloud that begins to envelop the area you were previously in. The screams of the distant victims are horrible.\n\nYou feel like you’re living a nightmare as you constantly bump into corpses, both moving and unmoving. Defensive chops with your sword do nothing to kill the unnatural creatures and only temporarily push them out of your way. It is only by sheer luck that you get away without getting killed.\n\nYou run further, leaving the carnage behind. You look back again to see if anything is in pursuit, but nothing is to your relief. Still, you’re not comfortable and you continue to distance yourself until you can run no further and you must stop to rest.\n\nIt is at this point, you wonder what you’re going to do. You wonder if going back to report to the nearest Zalan commander would be wise. Will they punish you for running away? The situation was hopeless, surely they couldn’t...could they? And even if they don’t, then what? Send you back in? That’s definitely not appealing given what you’ve seen.\n\nAt this point you’re really regretting your decision to join the army. You wish you could just leave. You want to go home.\n\nGoing AWOL back in Retlad wasn’t really an option; you would’ve been hunted down. But now? You probably would be listed as a casualty. You could theoretically disappear and attempt to live anonymously and do what you wanted to do in the first place. Just travel and play. Your family would even be compensated for your death, but still…you’d hate to put them through the grief of it, if it isn’t true.\n\nBefore you ponder your future options any further, you suddenly feel a pain in your side…you look down and see that you’re bleeding. Apparently you were stabbed and didn’t even realize it due to the adrenaline. You’re feeling the pain now though and you attempt to stop the bleeding as much as you can.\n\nRegardless of what you’re going to do in the future, right now you have to find civilization to at least get fixed up. The problem is that you don’t know where the hell you are. You look around for some possible landmarks, but you’re not seeing anything familiar. Lacking any other ideas, you start walking in the general direction of where you think the Zalan Empire is located.\n\nYou walk for a few hours and the pain is getting worse. You start thinking that you might not get the chance to worry anymore about your potential future, but a farm house in the distance gives you a little hope and you press on.\n\nYou get close to the front porch and that’s when you stop. The front door is broken off its hinges and a few windows are also broken. You also notice a leg lying in the grass near you. Worse, whatever did this is apparently still around judging by the loud voices you’re hearing from inside.\n\n“Ha ha! Human women are such squealers! Not as much fun as elven women though!”\n“Oh that’s real original. Why is everyone always got such a fucking hard on for elven women? Too damn fragile if you ask me.”\n“Go fucking rape a troll girl then.”\n“Huh. Easier said than done my unimaginative friend. I tried that once and almost got married.”\n“HAHAHAHA! See I told you this would be more fun than following Velzix…hey you smell that?”\n“Yes, I did sense the smell of fresh human blood in the air. Do you suppose we missed one?”\n“Only one way to find out!”\n\nAt this point you start to back away as quickly as you can. You can’t even run due to the pain, but you try your best. Your best isn’t good enough though, as the dwellers of the farmhouse have exited and seen you.\n\nAnd as with everything that’s been fucked up today, the ones that just exited the farmhouse happen to be demons. One is a bigger brutish looking sort, while the other is smaller yet definitely still more muscular than you.\n\n“Well what do we have here? Wounded meat? I say he gets to that rock before you can catch him and pull out his heart.”\n“Hah! I’ll take that bet!”\n\nThe bigger one starts to walk towards you, but will undoubtedly quicken his pace soon.\n","page 83":"Dear Mom,\n\nWe’re falling back again. No surprise there. I’ve had a lot on my mind lately, but not for any of reasons you’d know, so I’ll tell you.\n\nNormally this would be something I would’ve told Mallack, but since he’s dead, I feel like I should tell you. I really miss Mallack.\n\nI was in contact with a woman by the name of Helena. She was a traveling merchant who I met years ago during my tour in Retlad. We had a relationship of sorts I suppose. We met whenever she was in the area I was stationed in. Dunno why I never told you about her, I guess I just felt weird about telling you. Silly now that I think about it.\n\nAnyway, she was in the city of Edat a few months ago when it was utterly destroyed. I suggested that she should just stay in the Retlad province since the fighting wasn’t as bad there, but she said there was a big deal to be made in Edat, so she went. Reports say there were no survivors. Of course reports have been wrong before and I have used some of my connections to find out for certain but considering the carnage that occurred I hold little hope.\n\nI’ll miss her. I can only hope that like Mallack, she wasn’t turned into one of those things.\n\nThe word “hero” gets thrown around far too much and I should know first hand, but I’ll use it here: Where are the “heroes” to stop this? Shouldn’t some party of adventurers been able to slip through the Great Lich Lord’s defenses and chop his head off by now? Wasn’t that how the first one was stopped? Isn’t that how it’s supposed to go? Where are the gods? Why aren’t the good ones doing something to stop the utter destruction of their worshippers?! Hell, the evil ones would even suffice at this point! I mean just to know that SOMETHING is looking out for us in some fashion!\n\nIf they haven’t abandoned this world, they better do something quick, because I feel like we’re in the last hours here. Actually I think we’re on borrowed time.\n\nWe’re getting a report that we might have to fall back to the heart of the empire soon. At this point I’m not sure if I’m even going to do it. I know I’ve been duty bound this long with only a few falters along the way, but now? In the face of extinction? What’s the point?\n\nSure there may be nowhere to run from death, but perhaps I can evade him for as long as possible.\n\nBut I haven’t forgotten about all of you. I’d never do that. Even if I have to drag you all out of that infernal farmhouse kicking and screaming.\n\nLeave a light on for me, I may be coming home.\n\nI love you all.\n\nYour son\n","page 86":"Better to get accustomed to them now, since you figure you might have to live in them in the future anyway.\n\nYou head further north and traverse the harsh terrain. As far as undead are concerned you’re in no danger, however the mountain trolls and cragmaws living there are just as dangerous. You eventually find a suitable cave to live in. To keep yourself entertained you play your music in between your survival.\n\nIt’s a rough life, but you persevere for a few years. Unfortunately the day comes when a particularly large mountain troll tribe decides to finally get organized enough to eliminate you from being a nuisance.\n\nYou awaken one night to see several large figures enter your cave. You spring to action immediately, which causes the trolls to laugh. This buys you time to kill at least one of them, but only one. You’re outnumbered, trapped and there’s nowhere to hide.\n\nThe trolls savagely butcher you and even smash your mandolin over your head before you head to permanent unconsciousness.\n\nThe only good thing is that trolls do such a thorough job of eating your body that not even your bones are left to be reanimated when the Great Lich Lord’s influence reaches the area.\n","page 41":"Dear Mom,\n\nI’m writing this just before we head off to Nuro. I’m sort of scared. I know I shouldn’t, but I can’t help it. I also know I’ve been in danger several times before, but I have a bad feeling about this mission.\n\nI remember those old stories Dad told about the Dead War that occurred centuries ago. Those used to scare the hell out of me. I was usually thankful when you told him to stop telling me and Mallack about it.\n\nStill he always said that he told those stories so that we could better appreciate the relatively “safe” time we live in now even if it isn’t perfect. I’d hate to think that he was wrong about that, because I certainly wouldn’t want to live during the years of the Great Lich Lord’s reign of terror.\n\nI’ve been told that this “outbreak” is still small enough to be contained and eliminated, but that doesn’t make me feel any better.\n\nNuro is a place of strong magic! If they couldn’t handle this problem, how are we going to be able to? What manner of undead are going to face us? What of the evil wizards that caused this in the first place? As far as my company goes, the only really powerful one we have is Wessel. I hope they aren’t just sending us, or that we’ll at least have much more magical back up by the time we arrive there.\n\nI’ve been trying to not worry about this, but this doesn’t feel right. In my heart it doesn’t feel right. I just hope and pray to all the gods that I survive this.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son\n","page 85":"Running from the undead, only to die of starvation and the cold in the mountains isn’t your idea of survival. You’re sticking to familiar terrain. You travel further away from civilization and ultimately deeper into a large forest. You’re not exactly sure of where you’re at, but you know you’ve left the Zalan borders. You’re probably in the unclaimed area north of the Retlad province. You never patrolled that far when you were stationed there, so you’re unsure of what to expect. You’ll certainly have to be alert though.\n\nA few weeks pass and you’ve got the hang of it. A few close calls with an Eberaw Hunter, but you’ve managed to make somewhat of a home for yourself. You mainly sleep in the trees. You get water from springs and small streams and as for food, well you always were good at hunting.\n\nYou pass the time playing your mandolin and just basically keeping watch. As the days pass by though, you get the impression that someone is watching YOU.\n\nIt’s not any undead though. You haven’t seen any in weeks. You haven’t come across any living creatures of higher intelligence either, but then again that doesn’t mean they aren’t around…\n\n“Hello stranger. Do you like our forest?” you hear a small voice say.\n\nYou look around, but see nothing. You guess who ever it is, is invisible, and you nearly go for your weapon.\n\n“Please, no need for that. You are among friends here, musical one.” The voice says and then you see your unseen host appears before you. She’s very small and probably only comes up to ankle. You’ve heard of fairies before, but you’ve never seen one.\n\n“Are you a fairy?” you ask.\n“We go by many different names. Technically I am a pixie, but if you prefer, fairy will do. We heard you playing over the weeks and I thought it was about time we told you our appreciation for it. We didn’t know you big people had gifts for it. You are human are you not?”\n“Yes, and thanks.”\n“So, what brings you out here? Are you a ranger perhaps? You seem to have skills about you that are useful in this environment.”\n“No, not a ranger. Just trying to escape death like everyone else I suppose.”\n“Hmm, you realize as beautiful as this forest is, it’s not without its dangers. Death is here as well, but I’m sure you know that.”\n“Yes, but its at least reasonable. There aren’t zombies and wraiths terrorizing the place…well at least not yet…”\n“What are you talking about stranger?” the pixie asks quizzically, you look a little surprised yourself.\n\n“The Great Lich Lord of course. He’s destroying everything, and I dunno how he’s going to be stopped. I don’t think he can.”\n\nYour words immediately make the pixie’s cheerful demeanor change immediately.\n\n“…he’s returned?! But he was killed centuries ago! My clan has told the stories for generations!”\n“Well, he’s back, or someone like him…you really didn’t know? I mean this war with him has been going on for years now. Ten to be precise. Don’t you leave this forest?”\n“You must understand stranger, we have everything we want here. There is no need to leave. We also live in illusions, what you see now, is not necessarily what is. We remain hidden in our illusions so nobody may ever harm us and we can live our lives in relative isolation. It is only on rare occasions that we reveal ourselves.”\n“But I’ve heard stories about your kind being elsewhere or even in cities.” You say.\n“Well we are not the only fairy folk you know! Perhaps the others you heard of were sprites, or brownies or even a different clan of pixies. I can only speak for my clan and as far as I know we are the only fairy folk that live in this particular forest. There are other denizens of course, but thanks to our illusions we stay safely hidden. Even the occasional human or goblinoid that has wandered in here has not disturbed us. Quite frankly, you’d be the first person in centuries that we’ve revealed ourselves to.”\n“There aren’t any elves in this forest?” you ask, sort of figuring that some might have retreated or made a home here, forests being their natural homes and all. Your question is met with slight annoyance.\n\n“Most certainly not! This place has been elf free for millennia and hopefully stays that way! I’ll speak no more of this elven nonsense!”\n\nYou don’t press the issue, but up until now you figured fairy folk and elves were all friends, guess not. The pixie changes the subject since she wants to know more about this Great Lich Lord business and says her name is Qweet. Qweet tells you that she will return with the rest of her clan, as she will not reveal their home of course. In a somewhat playful yet firm tone she also warns you not to try to follow her, though as good of a tracker you are you doubt if you could anyway since she turns invisible again.\n\nWhile you wait, you still can’t believe she and the rest of her clan don’t know anything about what’s going on; you almost envy them for living in blissful ignorance for the last ten years. You also feel like you’ve ruined things for them.\n\nEventually more pixies return and you tell them what’s been going on. They are saddened, but maintain a confident demeanor. They are certain that they will survive this plague due to their illusions. They explain that if need be they can hide the entire forest, which with the new grim information you gave them they are very inclined to do. They still have to discuss it.\n\nIn the meantime they say they hope you’ll stick around for awhile as they still enjoy your playing and you aren’t destroying the forest. You’re just glad you’ve met some friendly people that aren’t trying to kill you. It’s a nice change and after what you’ve been through recently, you welcome it.\n\nOne year passes…\n\nYour time in the pixie forest has been relatively safe. Other than the occasional aggressive forest beasts, you haven’t had to do much combat. It’s been a relief. You’ve enjoyed the company of the pixies as well.\n\nHowever, your natural curiosity has gotten the better of you on occasion and you have made a few trips outside of the forest.\n\nYou travel as far as the Retlad province and the first obscure village you stumble across is completely decimated, with undead roaming around. The scary part about it is this is very recent looking, which means they’re starting to head your way.\n\nIt’ll start with the occasional zombie or skeleton wandering in. Then more will come. How long before an army arrives? Again due to your information, Qweet and the rest of her clan have made the final decision to hide their forest entirely. They tell you that they would like you to stay. You would even be allowed to see their true home. The only stipulation is that you would not be able to leave. The illusion wouldn’t just hide the forest, but it would create a barrier preventing entry or exit. You can’t imagine how it would look to those on the outside of the forest.\n\nAppealing to be sure, but as much as you like the company of the pixies, you don’t think it will be safe to dwell in their forest for too much longer, illusions or not. The Gnomes back in the Garwold Confederacy had some excellent illusionists as well, and it didn’t help them.\n","page 6":"Nope, you’re not doing this. This is suicide in your opinion. You have no idea what to expect and it sound a lot more dangerous than anything you’ve ever faced.\n\nInstead of leaving with them the next day, you go back home. You don’t worry about anyone coming after you, but you know you won’t be welcomed back into the company again, and you wouldn’t want to anyway.\n\nWhen you get back home, your family and mom in particular ask what happened, you explain it and say you don’t want any part of that life. You apologize that you couldn’t go through with it, but your mom looks more relieved than anything.\n\n“Well son, I’m just as glad you didn’t go get yourself killed over there anyway. You’ll be helping us out plenty just by working on the farm like always.”\n\nYou’re glad to hear that. Over the next couple days you fall back into routine again. You still wonder about the future though and you briefly consider the army plan again, but given your short lived experience with mercenary “life” you don’t think you’re cut out with battle on a regular basis. Plus the Zalan Empire is currently on heightened alert and battle ready status with this Nuro Incident and all.\n\nYou resign yourself to the farm life. You play your lute to yourself (and family) when you have the time to do so. It’s a simple life.\n\nTwo years pass and things have gotten worse. The Necromancer Lord (as he’s become to be known) has expanded, even to the point of taking over the Brot Kingdom. The Tulan Kingdom has been totally conquered by a demon army. A Grand Alliance of nations has been formed, but so far they don’t seem to be making much progress.\n\nMeanwhile life on the farm is a little harder. Your youngest sister Makana becomes gravely ill during the winter months, but there’s not enough money to pay for a healer and most of the clerics have been summoned to battle with the undead or demon hordes. Sadly she dies making the overall mood of the farm a little more depressing. You don’t even play anymore, your enthusiasm for music died along with the grim realities setting in.\n\nAnother three years pass and things are down right miserable. War is everywhere. The Demons have been taken care of, (You heard your former mercenary captain died in battle with their leader Velzix) but the undead are stronger than ever. Reports even speak of the Necromancer Lord becoming The Great Lich Lord “reborn”.\n\nTo make things worse, the Zalan Empire has been becoming increasingly tyrannical. In order to help with the war effort they’ve started bringing back the draft and the talk of ceasing private property to be used for the good of the government. While they say owners will be able to live and still work on their lands and businesses, it will be owned by the Empire.\n\nYou know it’s only a matter of time when you get a knock on the door by Zalan army troops coming to take you and your brother Mallack away to the army and your family’s farm.\n\nAnother two year pass….\n\nYou’re on the eve of battle in a land known as the Garwold Confederacy although it’s steadily becoming a giant graveyard now. The undead hordes have been sweeping relentlessly across the entire landscape. Your own company has had to fall back several times. Morale is low. Not that yours was high to begin with. You don’t even know how you’ve survived this long. While you had some battle experience during your time with the mercenary company, it still hasn’t prepared you for the horrors you’ve seen. The undead…you’ll never get used to fighting such emotionless creatures that are the embodiment of death and all that’s unnatural.\n\nYou briefly wonder if your brother Mallack is alright where he’s stationed, but it hardly matters at this point.\n\nBattle comes as it always does and you are not so lucky this time. Horrible and powerful creatures known as Blood Specters and Death Knights utterly destroy your side.\n\nYou fall to undead blades and chilling touches only rise up and join them in their goal of global genocide.\n","page 19":"Whatever the Captain is “going through” doesn’t involve you. You’ve got your own concerns. If the world events get so bad that they reach your doorstep, then you deal with it then, but risking your life to the extent of going deep into the heart of demon territory isn’t what you signed up for.\n\nYou head home and tell your family that it’s permanent this time. You explain your reasons and apologize that you won’t be bringing in all the extra money like you used to. They aren’t mad though, your mom is actually relieved.\n\n“Well son, I’m just as glad you didn’t go get yourself killed over there anyway. You’ll be helping us out plenty just by working on the farm like always.”\n\nYou’re glad to hear that. Over the next couple days you fall back into routine again.

You turn around and draw your bow, trying to ignore your pain which is overriding any fear you have at this point. Your weakened state is causing you to have a hard time aiming.\n\n“Uh oh, better be careful, looks like this one is going to put up a fight. I’d say by his uniform that he’s a soldier.”\n“Hur hur. Good. Hey human, better stop wobbling if you’re going to aim that thing properly.”\n\nYou miss the demon completely.\n\n“Hah! You want me to walk slower human?”\n”You sure you should be playing with him like that? Don’t you remember what happened earlier today?”\n“Shut up! I told ya, that bitch musta had some magical powers because…OW!”\n\nYou hit the demon in the chest, but it doesn’t seem much damage. He pulls out the arrow and now begins to quicken his pace. The other demon starts to walk towards you as well.\n\n“See, I told you to pay attention.”\n“Bah! If this is the extent of what his little pig sticker can do, I’m not concerned. Hey human, don’t you know they’re doing great things with gunpower these days? RAAAAGH!”\n\nThe big demon suddenly charges you, and you let your arrow fly. Right in the eye.\n\n“Perfect.” You whisper.\n\nThe demon bellows, but it doesn’t slow him down. You narrowly dodge his charge. You roll on the ground and shoot two more arrows in his back. He turns around snarling and bellowing for your blood. More arrows fly into the creature, but at last the demon has reached you and smacks you to the ground. Your bow flies from your hand, and while crawling on the ground you try to draw your sword, but a crushing blow hits you on the back. This might’ve caused a lot more damage, but miraculously the lute that’s still in your pack “softens” the blow. The crunching of wood signifies that it’s broken though.\n\n“What the fuck, that’s a weird noise…what is this? HA HA HA! Hey! You gotta be shittin’ me! A fuckin’ lute? Check this out! He’s carrying a fuckin’ lute! What’s a fucking soldier doin’ with a lute?” the big demon shouts to his acquaintance while he holds up your broken instrument.\n“Don’t talk you idiot! LOOK OUT!” his acquaintance shouts, just as you recover long enough to shove your sword straight into the demon’s groin. You push the sword upward in an attempt to do more damage and you succeed. Blood is flying everywhere and the demon howls in pain from the grievous wound. You pull your sword out and then proceed to repeatedly stab the demon until it falls backwards on the ground, dead.\n\nYou’re exhausted; you used all your remaining strength killing the thing. Unfortunately the other demon grabs you by the scruff like a helpless kitten and lifts you up off the ground a few inches. He knocks your sword out of your hand and looks at his fallen comrade.\n“Hmm, can’t say I didn’t warn him. Oh well, more meat for me. This may hurt a lot…”\n\nFully expecting the death that you’ve managed to avoid for so long, you once again evade it when a gunshot rings out and part of the demon’s head splatters in your face. You’re dropped immediately. The demon’s body is still standing though.\n\n“Shoot the bastard again!” you hear a gruff voice shout and this time the next shot hits chest and the demon falls.\n\nYou lay motionless on the ground, looking up in the sky when your saviors come up to you. It’s a group of dwarves armed with gun powder weapons.\n\n“By the gods, get doc out here! We need to fix this man up! Hey lad, you’ll be alright, don’t worry…are you a Zalan soldier?” one of the dwarves asks you.\n“…yeah…Nuro…lost…all dead…” is all you utter before fall into unconsciousness.\n\nA few days pass before you’re somewhat back to a coherent state. You find yourself in a military outpost and at this point you don’t care. You’re just happy to be alive.\n\nIt would seem that during your escape from Nuro, you ran in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom, the dwarven scouts that found you were from a small neutral kingdom trying its best to stay out of the dispute between Tulan and Zalan, but the new threat of demons running all over the nearby countryside caused them to increase patrols. They fixed you up, but dropped you off at the closest Zalan Fort. The Zalan fort that you’re in right now is called Virtue and it’s on the Tulan border. It seems relatively calm though. Not at all what you thought it would be.\n\nWhen one of the healers comes in to check on you, you begin to ask questions which she tries to answer to get you up to speed.\n\nThe Tulan Kingdom is currently under attack from the demons now. They’ve been assaulting the place and even gaining help from some of the evil populace there. The demon citizens there have reverted back to their “bad behavior” and thrown their lot in with the invaders as well. That doesn’t surprise you. The Tulan Kingdom pulled back some of their military from the borders so the fighting hasn’t been as bad and Zalan’s made a little more progress during this time, but the military minds are being cautious not to over extend. There is extreme concern over the recent demon invasion, not to mention the incident at Nuro. Word has already spread about the unsuccessful siege there.\n\nThe healer also tells you that a few Zalan “high ups” are eager to speak to you soon, as they want to know what exactly happened at Nuro. You’re somewhat of an important survivor since as far as anyone knows; you were the only one to successfully escape that killing zone. There’s also talk of a “Grand Alliance” being created to counter these new threats.\n\nWhile the healer talks you end up drifting back to sleep wishing you could just escape it all.\n\nOne year passes…\n\nYou’re still at Fort Virtue and it doesn’t look like you’ll be leaving the army anytime soon.\n\nYou couldn’t have been more wrong on your belief that you’d get executed for cowardice. You got promoted to sergeant instead, which in light of the current situation, is nearly the same thing.\n\nYour promotion came after several Zalan officers spoke to you about Nuro. You even got a medal.\n\nStories and rumors creep around about how against all odds you survived an undead onslaught and fought off a bunch of demons as well. Your past “reputation” from your time in Retlad is exaggerated as well. It doesn’t help that the citizens there remember you and are all willing to add to the exaggeration.\n\nAll of these stories have been woven together in such an elaborate way to make you seem like some kind of hero most likely for propaganda purposes. And you know you’re not hero. In fact you try to explain you aren’t a hero to people, but they think you’re just being modest, eventually you give up.\n\nYour assignment at Virtue hasn’t been uneventful. There’s fighting, but now it’s mainly demon commanded enemies rather than Tulan ones. Some demon lord called Velzix killed the royalty there, completely conquered the area and made it his realm. The border war continues under new management except now it’s more than just a border that the enemy is looking to take. Your superior, Captain Eckard reminds you of Valhlat except with a different name. You suppose there is a certain “cookie cutter” that occurs within the Zalan army that causes people to act the same. You’ve briefly wondered if you ever make that rank, you’ll act the same way. You then usually laugh at the very fact that you ever would.\n\nFort Virtue hasn’t suffered a really bad attack yet, and it’s mostly skirmishes, but it’s like waiting for the other shoe to drop. You routinely go on patrols and give orders which you didn’t think you’d be good at, but you think back to how you used to order your brothers and sisters around and perhaps you always had a bit a leadership skill, you just didn’t want it.\n\nYou thought that you’d be able to at least visit your family, but of course due to recent events, you’re ordered to stay put. Your family at least is getting more money from your pay increase. They even send a new lute for you after you told them of the unfortunate event that resulted in the destruction of your last one. This gives you a little pleasure in a relatively joyless assignment.\n\nAll in all, you still prefer it compared to being in the unsuccessful assaults on Nuro. The Grand Alliance that was formed hasn’t been too successful as every one has been a slaughter from what you’ve heard. You already went through that once. You don’t relish the idea of going through it again.\n\nOne day while you’re spending your free time practicing a new song, some new soldiers come into the fort. They look like they’ve just seen a vicious battle and are here to restock. One of them sees you and gives you a disapproving look. It’s a woman with striking good looks, but definitely carrying an air of leadership about her. Her rank signifies her as a captain…yep same cookie cutter, just a little prettier.\n\n“You there! What are you doing playing an instrument? Shouldn’t you be on watch or doing something more constructive with your time soldier? And you’re a sergeant? You should know better!”\n“I’m not on watch duty right now and…”\n\nThe woman doesn’t even let you finish your explanation. Other soldiers that were sitting in your area are now slowly creeping out of the fray. Even her own soldiers are creeping away. They probably know all too well of how she acts.\n\n“So? You think evil is going to wait around for you to be ready for battle? Where is your superior officer? I can’t believe they would allow such a relaxed attitude around here considering the importance of this fort! If you were serving under me, I’d have you flogged for your lack of discipline!”\n","page 18":"You might be a fool, but the possibility that the Captain knows what the fuck he’s talking about can’t be ruled out. If killing demons now is going to make life a little safer for your family in the future, then you probably should be apart of that. Same with the undead if it comes to that, though you’re hoping that you don’t need to. Fighting demons is bad enough, you haven’t even fought any undead and the stories that your dad told you and that you’ve overheard others tell still makes you dread the day that you’ll actually have to.\n\nFor now though you’re going home to spend time with your family and tell them all how much you love them.\n\nOne year passes…\n\nFive years since the Nuro Incident and you’re deep in the heart of Velzix’s Realm. Guerrilla hit and run tactics and sabotage have greatly angered Velzix causing him to divert forces where he might use elsewhere. You’ve even managed to sneak into his fortress a few times to sabotage his goals of creating a permanent open portal to the Infernal Planes. Something nobody wants except the demons.\n\nIt’s odd, but the Chimera Company has been turned from an example of “thugs for hire” to “Heroic warriors” by the Zalan government, but then the Zalan Empire has always been a bit heavy on propaganda. The fact that the company is directly working for it, makes any politician that was remotely involved with the idea of hiring you in the first place to milk it for all its worth.\n\nThe real truth however is what’s currently of the company is made up of the suicidal, desperate or the insane. You’re not sure which one you are at this point, but in the eyes of the public, you’re a hero. (Surprisingly Cal is still there for all his past complaining)\n\nThe Captain has been telling tales of his past life a lot more lately when sitting around the campfire. He talks about the people he’s killed, the women he’s raped, and the treasures he’s plundered. Most of the stories you’ve only heard about in rumor from others in your Company, but hearing them come from the Captain himself makes him sound even more rotten. You’re sure glad you didn’t know him back in the “old days”. He doesn’t seem to show any remorse, though he doesn’t really talk about it gloriously either. He just tells them as a story to pass the time between fighting, much like you do with playing your lute.\n\nEvery now and then he tells you to play something specific. Some elven song that you’ve never heard before, though apparently he really wants you to play it since he gives you a crumpled piece of sheet music containing its notes.\n\nIt’s a not a complex song for an Elven one, but it still takes you a few weeks to learn it completely. It would probably take you less time, but there’s the demon fighting that sort of gets in the way of practice.\n\nThe first time you play it, the Captain, closes his eyes and begins to smile. You think that’s the first time you’ve ever seen him do that. Others in the Company are amazed as well.\n\nWith his eyes still closed he begins to speak of his family and how beautiful his wife is and how when he first met her it was love at first sight.\n\nHe then speaks of his daughter, and how proud he is of her. Her battle skills have gotten her a captain’s position in Grand Alliance army. He hopes that she has many victorious battles and kills all those that stand before her without mercy.\n\nHe is silent for awhile as you play…then he speaks of his son is much harsher tone.\n\n“A disappointment…a fucking disappointment. Fucked up somewhere…wasn’t hard enough on him. Now look at this shit we’re in…demons, undead…fuck it. If I’m bound for the Infernal Plane for bringing destruction to the world then I’m gonna give those bastard demons a good reason for torturing the shit outta me when I get there. Namely by killing a shitload of them and fucking up their plans as much as possible. Just hope my necromancer spawn is eventually there right beside me getting tortured as well.”\n\nYou temporarily stop playing at this outburst by the Captain. Others in the Company are looking and whispering to each other. Did he just allude to what you think he did?\n\n“What he fuck are you doin’? I didn’t say stop playing!”\n\nYou quickly return to playing and nothing more is spoken of it. As it happens the song is one of the last things you play. Your lute is destroyed in a battle a couple days later. You curse as one of the few things that took your mind off this shitty place is gone. You just hope you live long enough to buy a new one.\n\nA few more weeks pass and what wasn’t spoken of, makes an appearance…\n\nTwo of the lookouts run back to the main camp one day and rush into the Captain’s tent. You can hear them babbling something about son, and death and doomed. You then hear him yelling at them to shut the fuck up and speak clearly. The rest of the Company starts to pick up there weapons as if expecting something to go down and you follow suit and that’s when you look in the direction where the sentries ran from and see a lone hooded figure.\n\nNone of you don’t know how to react. Every instinct in everyone is telling them to attack, but the aura of power and fear he’s giving off is very strong. Almost paralyzing.\n\nJust then the Captain comes out of his tent and speaks.\n\n“Boy, you gotta a lot of balls showing up here before me. Didn’t think you had ‘em either. Figured you’d be hiding in some tower somewhere.”\n“Yeah, well sometimes you have to do things yourself.”\n\nWeird. He doesn\u0027t sound at all like you thought he would.\n","page 100":"Despite your fears, you’ve always had a sense of duty and responsibility, something that probably won’t ever completely go away due to how you grew up. You’re not running away, you did join to help provide for your family after all.\n\nBefore your company packs up and leaves Retlad, you write a quick letter to your family and hand it off to a messenger. Many of the Retlad citizens aren’t too pleased to see you leave, but they don’t really have any say in the matter, just like you don’t. There isn’t much talking on the trip, though, everyone is pretty silent. Wessel however is doing enough for everyone.\n\n“I can’t believe something like this happened! Nuro was a beacon of enlightenment and well prepared for situations like this! I…can’t believe this didn’t occur without some sort of demonic influence. I’ll bet that Mr. Demar had something to do with this! I remember taking his class and he was always a creepy bastard. Before I could graduate I had to take his conjuration 101 class and he didn’t like me because I had made several logical arguments to as why that branch of magic should be outlawed altogether. And it’s obvious by what happened recently that I was right! Nevertheless I did all the required work in the class and I still got a B! Way to fuck up my perfect record! I get the same grade as some bumbling idiot who summoned up a Nurk Beast that he lost control over and bit off someone’s hand! Where is the fucking justice?”\n\nOnce again, Wessel has turned the topic to focus on himself. Happily Captain Vahlat tells him to shut the fuck up.\n\nYou’ll be near Nuro soon and your company makes camp for the night. While all of you are on edge from what will come tomorrow, someone finally says something.\n\n“Hey farmboy, play us a song on that thing.”\n“…what did you want to hear?” you ask, not expecting to be called to play under these circumstances. In fact it just occurred to you that you’ve never played for anyone in your company! You assume that they all knew that you did, but they just were never interested enough to stick around and listen to you before.\n\n“I dunno, play whatever it was you used to play for the Retlad citizens…it seemed to make them happy.”\n\nYou pull out your lute and take a deep breath and start playing. At first you’re just concentrating on the strings and making sure you don’t mess anything up, but when you look up, you can see that everyone in the camp is listening intently to your music, even Wessel. Tensions seem to have decreased. It’s like a wave of calmness has struck the camp. You never believed your playing could have that much of an effect on people. Eventually the song ends and the Captain tells everyone who isn’t on watch to get some sleep. He then takes you aside.\n\n“Heard your playing…damn shame that you’re here. You really should be doing that instead.” Valhlat remarks.\n“I know.”\n“Hm. I know you joined mainly to help support your family.”\n“Yeah, I just hope I get to see them again.”\n“Bah, don’t start talking like that. I’ve seen you with a bow, you pluck that thing even better than that lute. You’ve been in battle before and survived, I see you doing it again.”\n“I sure hope so, its just I dunno…the undead…I’ve heard stories.”\n“Yeah, everyone’s heard the stories, but stories tend to be exaggerated. Now I dunno about what happened centuries ago, since I wasn’t there, but I HAVE fought the undead before. One of my first assignments was taking care of some minor undead incursion in a little village. Some asshole stumbled upon an ancient scroll and started reading the goddamn words on it out loud. They look a lot worse than they actually are. Most of the time they’re incredibly slow, and easily dispatched. Its mainly a psychological advantage from all the stories people have told about them that cause this quaking fear in most folks.”\n“Well I suppose, but what about the necromancers?”\n“Feh, they’re wizards and just like all the rest their arrogance is their undoing. Most of these so-called necromancers are half-assed ones that get killed by their own undead troops. Anyway, get to sleep; you want to be fully alert for tomorrow’s battle. It still won’t be a walk in the park, but it’s not going to be a death sentence.”\n\nYou take the Captain’s words into consideration, but in the back of your mind before you go to sleep, you’re thinking “But they can’t be that half-assed, they successfully took over Nuro…”\n\nThe next day arrives and you finish your trip to Nuro and that’s when you see the city for the first time. You always wanted to visit it after hearing about it from Wessel, but even from this distance it doesn’t look like anything he described.\n\n“By the gods…what…” Wessel slowly whispers.\n\nThe stench of death is thick in the air. You see thousands of bodies outside the city gates and they aren’t lying down either. They aren’t advancing either though. There just standing there like…well zombies.\n\nYour company isn’t the only one here though, there are a few others awaiting orders. You see one from the Brot Kingdom and another from the Azi Republic. Thankfully there’s another Zalan one as well to boost your numbers.\n\nThe respective captains acknowledge each other’s presence, a short meeting is made and then the inevitable comes. The attack.\n\nAt first things seem to go well. All ranged troops are ordered to fire upon the enemy who are still just standing there. Arrows pierce zombie brains, gunshots destroy skeleton bones, spells blast at walls and it seems very easy.\n\nThen from the battlements of Nuro a few figures begin casting a few offensive spells of their own. It’s at this point a charge is made towards the city.\n\n“When you get in range aim for the fucking wizards! Don’t fear these rotting meat sacks! We’re the fucking Zalan army! We don’t lose!” Captain Valhlat shouts.\n\nFine words, but they do little to uplift your impending sense of doom. It doesn’t help that the sky goes completely dark while you’re marching towards a bunch of undead and at the same time hoping you don’t get hit by a wizard’s spell. In the distance you briefly see a cleric from the Azi Republic riding a horse by himself. He appears to be calling upon some sort of holy might from whatever god he worships since a blue protective sphere appears around him. The next moment he’s hit by a black ray that goes straight through the sphere and his life is gone. Not even his god could protect him.\n\nAs you get closer, you see that the undead soldiers still haven’t moved, but there are significantly less of them as they continue to fall from ranged attacks. However, now other undead pop up on the walls of Nuro holding bows of their own.\n\n“SHIELDS!” Captain Valhlat shouts.\n\nMore of your side falls and now you’re so close you can smell the death in the air. The undead troops are now finally moving to do battle with your side. You attempt to target the robed figures on the battlements, but of course it’s very difficult in all this chaos and your fear.\n\nYou mostly only get the undead archers. Wessel is a little more successful is downing an enemy wizard.\n\n“Ha ha! Don’t you realize I graduated top of my class?!” you hear him shout.\n\nThe gates of Nuro are being broken down and despite the horror you’ve already seen, this battle still seems hopeful.\n\nThen a black cloaked hooded figure sudden appears on the battlements. You see him merely raise his arms briefly and that’s when you get the very real feeling that hope is lost.\n\nGhostly spirits come through the walls of Nuro making worse shrieks than when you fought the Quillars. At least they were living creatures. These drain lives at but a touch and there isn’t enough magic to fight the incorporeal creatures properly. You see the Brot Kingdom’s company break and run, but unfortunately for them and you, your possible retreat has been blocked. All the soldiers on your side that fell have now suddenly been raised, the undead soldiers that were killed have been raised as well. You’re fighting in the front, from behind and in some cases from within. It’s chaos.\n\n“Shit, I’m going to die today…” you whisper to yourself.\n\nCaptain Valhlat is knee deep in the dead, but this figure who’s apparently changed the tide of battle hasn’t escaped his attention. He points to the figure and barks orders at the top of his lungs.\n\n“KILL HIM! SHOOT THE FUCKER! DO IT! NOW!”\n","page 103":"You’ve served in this army well and always done your job regardless of the shitty situations you’ve been in. You might not like a lot of it, but you’ve never complained. Lately you’ve been on edge about a possible all out assault of some big ass demon army that’s going to attack any day now, and playing is one of the few pleasures you have to put your mind at ease.\n\nPerhaps it’s a combination of this and a combination of this unwanted and unnecessary scolding that causes you to speak out of turn.\n\n“With all due respect ma’am, I am fully prepared to battle at a moment’s notice and so are those under my direct command. But even soldiers need to rest, if only for a minute.”\n\nThe woman looks very surprised you didn’t comply with her demand to see your superior officer.\n\n“…you DARE speak out of turn like that to me? I’ll see you sent to the Nuro Front for that sort of insubordination! Then we’d see just how battle ready you are! How would you like that?”\n“I wouldn’t like it at all. I barely survived the first time.” You say trying not to express any fear.\n“…What? What are you talking about? First time?”\n\nNow you’re a little surprised she doesn’t know who you are considering how some of the high ups exaggerated about how you managed to survive. You explain yourself briefly and she doesn’t quite believe you at first, a couple of your troops hiding nearby at least back up your claims before slinking off.\n\n“That was YOU? What the hell are you doing here? You should be leading from the front not languishing in some fort that barely sees battle!”\n“Doesn’t see battle? We suffered a small demon raid last week! We see plenty of battle!”\n“What I mean is, somebody of your obvious combat and survival skills should be assigned on the front lines where you can do more good. Normally I don’t question Zalan command, but this is really an oversight on their part.”\n“Well maybe they know better than the both of us, besides this assignment isn’t a walk in the fairy fields. I think we’ll be suffering a grand scale attack any day now.”\n“Doubt it. Velzix has been having a hard time keeping his unruly mob together. If it wasn’t for a lot of the sycophantic Tulan citizens, he’d probably be confined to pure defense, though something will have to be done soon, reports say he’s attempting to gate in more demons everyday. Not to mention that supposedly civilized demons from other nations are starting to display their true colors and flock to his banner. Like I always said the only good demon is a dead one!”\n\nThis causes you to smile a bit and she very faintly smiles back when she sees that you feel the same way. This smile disappears quickly though as she continues her rant.\n\n“I wish I wasn’t assigned to the Tulan Border though. I’d rather be taking Nuro back. THAT’S the more dangerous threat. The demons will kill themselves with their own chaotic and violent natures, but the undead…they’ve almost taken over the world before just because of one bastard that lead them. I never thought I’d see a serious threat like this in my lifetime, especially not…”\n\nThe female captain at this point stops. She even looks away from you as if whatever she was going to say was just too much even for her. She seems to be a lot more battle hardened than you and probably ten times braver. You can’t imagine what horror she experienced that would be worse than your own, but you don’t find out since she changes the subject.\n\n“…Bah! Maybe you’re right; a soldier does need to keep their mind occupied on other things every now and then. We aren’t undead after all. So what’s with the lute? You also a bard or something?” she laughs.\n“No, I think those dreams are long gone, but my playing seems to boost spirits around here a little, which can only be a good thing in this situation.”\n“Hm. My mother was elven and she used to sing this song to me and my…brother when we were very young. It was very smooth and calming. Beautiful melody.”\n“Yeah, most elven music is like that. When I was assigned in Retlad I learned a few elven songs from a few of the citizens there, you wouldn’t happen to know the song would you?”\n\nShe tells you the name of the song and you know it immediately. One of the first new songs you learned while stationed in Retlad actually. This seems cause her to momentarily revert to a less stand offish behavior. You’re about to play it for her, but then a messenger comes running up handing her a note. She reads it and she’s all business again.\n\n“Alright men! We’re moving out!” she shouts and leaves without saying another word to you. You didn’t even learn her name.\n\nPerhaps it’s just as well; you’ll most likely never meet again due to one of you dying on the battlefield. You go back to doing what you were doing.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nThree years since the Nuro Incident and this struggle still continues.\n\nYou’re still stationed Fort Virtue and you’ve repelled more demon attacks than you would care to count. Velzix has finally gotten his shit together completely. A unified demonic front is in full swing here and its taking its toll. Once again your skills have come in very handy in defense. You are certainly known as a demon slayer, but you still don’t feel like a hero of any kind. You’re just trying to do your job and survive. You save lives when you can, but you know ultimately it’s a futile task as death seems to be everywhere nowadays.\n\nAs bad as it is on the demon front, its nothing compared to what’ve you’ve heard on the undead front. The Necromancer has finally broken out from Nuro, and successfully attacked the Kingdom of Brot. Several undead giants demolished the area. You’ve never even seen a living giant and they sound intimidating. You can’t even imagine an undead one. The power to raise one, let alone several is sort of scary. The Grand Alliance army didn’t get there in time to stop him and as usual they were repelled when they arrived.\n\nYou worry about the Grand Alliance failing to stop the undead horde. You hope it doesn’t get any closer to the Zalan Empire where your family might be in danger.\n\nSometimes you worry so much that you can’t sleep, not that you do much of that nowadays anyway. Normally you play to keep your mind at ease, but tonight you go to the archery range to keep yourself focused.\n\nFor a long time you’re by yourself, but suddenly you feel a creeping suspicion someone is watching you…\n\nYou turn around with your bow and see a pale man. He holds up his hands.\n\n“Hey now! Don’t shoot! Sorry for creeping around like that. Professional habit.” He says.\n“What? Who are you?” you demand.\n“Warnov. Zalan Intelligence.”\n“You’re a spy?”\n“Well I suppose you could put it that way. I was here to give some info to your Captain Eckard, and I also wanted to take a look around the fort. Didn’t think anyone would be on the range though. Nice shooting, I know who you are and heard about your marksmanship with a bow. You’re certainly doing your part with the demons around here.”\n\nDespite the fact that you’re talking to a spy, you feel the need to vent your feelings.\n\n“Yeah, well I hope the Grand Alliance starts doing its part. I mean what the fuck are they doing? Weren’t they created to put a stop to all this shit? I mean am I supposed to worry every day if that undead horde is going to get closer to the Zalan Empire where it can threaten my family?”\n\nWarnov doesn’t look offended by your words, if anything he looks intrigued.\n\n“Well, I can understand why you’re venting. Trust me I sympathize. But as part of intel, I can tell you its not that easy…there were a lot of surprises that weren’t accounted for. We’re doing our best to rectify this situation by gathering as much info as possible. In fact, you could help us…”\n“Excuse me? How?”\n\nWarnov looks around and gets closer before speaking.\n\n“Look, as I said, I know all about you and your skills, why you joined, all of it. I know you don’t much care for some of the propaganda made about some of your exploits. But it’s important to realize that deeds like yours must be blown up a little to give common people hope that ultimately good will win the day. You may not consider yourself a hero of any kind, but your actions aren’t without some of those qualities. You obviously care very much about your family, and I’ve heard how you try to keep the people under your command alive. Sound like heroic qualities to me. Perhaps they’re on a smaller scale, but they’re there. I’m betting that there’s a BIGGER hero in there somewhere, just itching to get out. You think the Grand Alliance isn’t doing a good job? Perhaps we can arrange something for you to be transferred into it, or maybe you’d like to take an even more direct approach.”\n“What do you mean?”\n\nWarnov suddenly backs away.\n\n“Before we go any further. I need to know are you willing to take up the mantle of being a hero. Because if you aren’t, then we have nothing more to discuss. I shall require an answer now.”\n","page 7":"You’re in this now and you can’t stop just because it’s looking tough. You got your family to think about. You’re staying.\n\nHowever you do, do something slightly out of character, you spend what little money you have on a whore for the night, mainly because you’re a lot less sure if you’re going to come back from this mission.\n\nThe next day you’re on the job. The march to the dwarven lands is mostly uneventful, though the fighting between the Zalan Empire and the Tulan Kingdom is still going on their borders which even skirting around, still manages to find your company. The Boss takes advantage of straggling Tulan soldiers that have fled battle. The butchery isn’t uncommon, after all, nobody will know and the Zalan Empire will just be blamed anyway.\n\nArrival in the Dwarven lands is met with caution, the Dwarves obviously know of the Chimera Company’s reputation and a small group of them motion the Boss to just talk to him directly. A deal seems to be made and the Dwarves leave to go back to their underground home.\n\nThe Captain now addresses all of you.\n\n“Alright, apparently there HAVE been demons running all up and down and through the area. The Dwarves are preparing defenses in case they try to invade underground; apparently they consider their underground city takes precedence so their main force is there. However they still have plenty of mines above ground and not nearly enough dwarves to defend them all. Now its been said the demons have been heading toward the Tulan Kingdom, but a lot of them still have been fucking around here and generally wrecking shit for the fun of it. Collapsing even the sturdy mines of the dwarves on their heads seems to be amusing to them. So our goal is to make things bothersome enough for them that they’ll leave the dwarves alone and go elsewhere.”\n\nThe Captain spits on the ground before continuing.\n\n“We’re going to split up for this assignment and take different mines in the area. Watch your fucking ass. I don’t think any of you eunuchs have fought any demons before, but I have and they’re utterly fucking ruthless. Forget all that shit about some of them being civilized. They’re about as civilized as damn Quillar, but a lot more intelligent. The chaos that is in their hearts is always there and these ones are the complete embodiment of it. And for fuck’s sake DON’T stay near any explosives! The dwarves are always using shit like that in their mines and demons have a tendency to have fire throwing abilities. It’s probably the reason for all the easy mine collapses.”\n\nThe Captain takes out a map.\n\n“One more thing. While I know the common thing to do on our assignments is to take advantage of things. We need to play this one completely fucking straight! Do NOT fucking do anything that’s going to piss off the dwarves! If you do, we don’t get paid. We don’t get paid. I’m going to get pissed, because we’re getting a lot for this one. And assuming the dwarves don’t kill you, I certainly fucking will. Alright now I’m going to assign you according to this map.”\n\nYou and a few others (Including Dimitri) are assigned to the Karzac Mines where you make your way to after some climbing which fortunately isn’t too far off ground level. The dwarves there regard you with suspicion immediately.\n\n“Oh great they’re here. Alright, let’s set the ground rules. I’m head miner Morri and I’m in charge of this place! Don’t even think about trying to steal some loose bars of silver that you might find lying around. You do it, and your skull meets an axe or mining pick! Got me?”\n“Stand up when you speak to me.” Dimitri laughs.\n“Yeah, make yer jokes human, we’ll see if the demons will appreciate that humor when you’re meeting them face to face.”\n“Demon, pah! Just one more thing for me to kill, people make a big deal about them. I’ve seen how they fall in line and become law abiding citizens just like anyone else when beaten down.”\n“Yeah and those same civilized ones will kill you when they get the chance. Didn’t you hear the Captain?” you say.\n“Yeah well he’s got a tendency to be over dramatic; he probably picked that up from that fine ass elven bitch he’s married to. Besides who DOESN’T try to kill you when they get the chance? They aren’t anything special. Their race just has a tendency to have assholiness come natural to them.”\n\nMorri interrupts the pair of you.\n\n“Hey if you two morons are finished, I’m about to tell you the fun part of this job. There are demons already in this mine.”\n“What?!”\n“Oh yeah, bunch of those fuckers as we speak. Seems we got the fortune of one sneaking in here and decided to have her spawn in the deep reaches of this mine. The only good thing is these types don’t seem to be interested in collapsing the mine, however they’re trying to turn this place into some sort of fucking demon hive or something. We’ve been trying to eliminate them, but of course it’s slow going. We need to get them before they start breeding more though. So we’re splitting up…”\n“Here we go again…” Dimitri says.\n\nMorri assigns at least a few dwarves with each mercenary. You, Morri and Dimitri make up the last one.\n\nThe demon hunting in the mines is actually a very “mundane” job. They certainly are horrible looking creatures and very vicious, but after the first few times, you get used to it. These particular demons have an insect like appearance so maybe that’s why these behave the way they do. They aren’t very tough in the scheme of things, but like Morri said there do seem to be a lot. You can’t use your bow like you want to either due to the cramped mine conditions.\n\nDemons aren’t really the problem though, the problem is Dimitri.\n\nAfter one of the harder battles, Morri is attempting to catch his breath. Dimitri notices the very large silver deposit you’re next to and the silver that’s just there for the taking. He quietly whispers to you that you and he should waylay Morri and take some of the silver. Leave his body to be munched on by a wandering demon. Who’s going to know?\n\nYou’re not really for this plan and you say no, but Dimitri begins to argue and Morri notices the both of you.\n\n“I’m not doing it! The Captain said…” you exclaim.\n“Fuckin’ pussy!” Dimitri says pushing you.\n“Hey hey hey! Not doing what? What are you two on abo…”\n\nDimitri takes the opportunity of distraction and hits Morri in the face with silver bar that he lifted off the ground earlier.\n\n“ Ugh! Bastard dog you’ll pay for this treachery!” Morri utters falling to the ground.\n“Come on, this is your last chance to be a man and help me pig farmer!” Dimitri says as he goes to finish off Morri.\n","page 102":"Demons are a lot faster than the undead and you’re wounded, no way are you going to be able to outrun them. You turn around and draw your bow, trying to ignore your pain which is overriding any fear you have at this point. Your weakened state is causing you to have a hard time aiming.\n\n“Uh oh, better be careful, looks like this one is going to put up a fight. I’d say by his uniform that he’s a soldier.”\n“Hur hur. Good. Hey human, better stop wobbling if you’re going to aim that thing properly.”\n\nYou miss the demon completely.\n\n“Hah! You want me to walk slower human?”\n”You sure you should be playing with him like that? Don’t you remember what happened earlier today?”\n“Shut up! I told ya, that bitch musta had some magical powers because…OW!”\n\nYou hit the demon in the chest, but it doesn’t seem much damage. He pulls out the arrow and now begins to quicken his pace. The other demon starts to walk towards you as well.\n\n“See, I told you to pay attention.”\n“Bah! If this is the extent of what his little pig sticker can do, I’m not concerned. Hey human, don’t you know they’re doing great things with gunpower these days? RAAAAGH!”\n\nThe big demon suddenly charges you, and you let your arrow fly. Right in the eye.\n\n“Perfect.” You whisper.\n\nThe demon bellows, but it doesn’t slow him down. You narrowly dodge his charge. You roll on the ground and shoot two more arrows in his back. He turns around snarling and bellowing for your blood. More arrows fly into the creature, but at last the demon has reached you and smacks you to the ground. Your bow flies from your hand, and while crawling on the ground you try to draw your sword, but a crushing blow hits you on the back. This might’ve caused a lot more damage, but miraculously the lute that’s still in your pack “softens” the blow. The crunching of wood signifies that it’s broken though.\n\n“What the fuck, that’s a weird noise…what is this? HA HA HA! Hey! You gotta be shittin’ me! A fuckin’ lute? Check this out! He’s carrying a fuckin’ lute! What’s a fucking soldier doin’ with a lute?” the big demon shouts to his acquaintance while he holds up your broken instrument.\n“Don’t talk you idiot! LOOK OUT!” his acquaintance shouts, just as you recover long enough to shove your sword straight into the demon’s groin. You push the sword upward in an attempt to do more damage and you succeed. Blood is flying everywhere and the demon howls in pain from the grievous wound. You pull your sword out and then proceed to repeatedly stab the demon until it falls backwards on the ground, dead.\n\nYou’re exhausted; you used all your remaining strength killing the thing. Unfortunately the other demon grabs you by the scruff like a helpless kitten and lifts you up off the ground a few inches. He knocks your sword out of your hand and looks at his fallen comrade.\n“Hmm, can’t say I didn’t warn him. Oh well, more meat for me. This may hurt a lot…”\n\nFully expecting the death that you’ve managed to avoid for so long, you once again evade it when a gunshot rings out and part of the demon’s head splatters in your face. You’re dropped immediately. The demon’s body is still standing though.\n\n“Shoot the bastard again!” you hear a gruff voice shout and this time the next shot hits chest and the demon falls.\n\nYou lay motionless on the ground, looking up in the sky when your saviors come up to you. It’s a group of dwarves armed with gun powder weapons.\n\n“By the gods, get doc out here! We need to fix this man up! Hey lad, you’ll be alright, don’t worry…are you a Zalan soldier?” one of the dwarves asks you.\n“…yeah…Nuro…lost…all dead…” is all you utter before fall into unconsciousness.\n\nA few days pass before you’re somewhat back to a coherent state. You find yourself in a military outpost and at this point you don’t care. You’re just happy to be alive.\n\nIt would seem that during your escape from Nuro, you ran in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom, the dwarven scouts that found you were from a small neutral kingdom trying its best to stay out of the dispute between Tulan and Zalan, but the new threat of demons running all over the nearby countryside caused them to increase patrols. They fixed you up, but dropped you off at the closest Zalan Fort. The Zalan fort that you’re in right now is called Virtue and it’s on the Tulan border. It seems relatively calm though. Not at all what you thought it would be.\n\nWhen one of the healers comes in to check on you, you begin to ask questions which she tries to answer to get you up to speed.\n\nThe Tulan Kingdom is currently under attack from the demons now. They’ve been assaulting the place and even gaining help from some of the evil populace there. The demon citizens there have reverted back to their “bad behavior” and thrown their lot in with the invaders as well. That doesn’t surprise you. The Tulan Kingdom pulled back some of their military from the borders so the fighting hasn’t been as bad and Zalan’s made a little more progress during this time, but the military minds are being cautious not to over extend. There is extreme concern over the recent demon invasion, not to mention the incident at Nuro. Word has already spread about the unsuccessful siege there.\n\nThe healer also tells you that a few Zalan “high ups” are eager to speak to you soon, as they want to know what exactly happened at Nuro. You’re somewhat of an important survivor since as far as anyone knows; you were the only one to successfully escape that killing zone. There’s also talk of a “Grand Alliance” being created to counter these new threats.\n\nWhile the healer talks you end up drifting back to sleep wishing you could just escape it all.\n\nOne year passes…\n\nYou’re still at Fort Virtue and it doesn’t look like you’ll be leaving the army anytime soon.\n\nYou couldn’t have been more wrong on your belief that you’d get executed for cowardice. You got promoted to sergeant instead, which in light of the current situation, is nearly the same thing.\n\nYour promotion came after several Zalan officers spoke to you about Nuro. You even got a medal.\n\nStories and rumors creep around about how against all odds you survived an undead onslaught and fought off a bunch of demons as well. Your past “reputation” from your time in Retlad is exaggerated as well. It doesn’t help that the citizens there remember you and are all willing to add to the exaggeration.\n\nAll of these stories have been woven together in such an elaborate way to make you seem like some kind of hero most likely for propaganda purposes. And you know you’re not hero. In fact you try to explain you aren’t a hero to people, but they think you’re just being modest, eventually you give up.\n\nYour assignment at Virtue hasn’t been uneventful. There’s fighting, but now it’s mainly demon commanded enemies rather than Tulan ones. Some demon lord called Velzix killed the royalty there, completely conquered the area and made it his realm. The border war continues under new management except now it’s more than just a border that the enemy is looking to take. Your superior, Captain Eckard reminds you of Valhlat except with a different name. You suppose there is a certain “cookie cutter” that occurs within the Zalan army that causes people to act the same. You’ve briefly wondered if you ever make that rank, you’ll act the same way. You then usually laugh at the very fact that you ever would.\n\nFort Virtue hasn’t suffered a really bad attack yet, and it’s mostly skirmishes, but it’s like waiting for the other shoe to drop. You routinely go on patrols and give orders which you didn’t think you’d be good at, but you think back to how you used to order your brothers and sisters around and perhaps you always had a bit a leadership skill, you just didn’t want it.\n\nYou thought that you’d be able to at least visit your family, but of course due to recent events, you’re ordered to stay put. Your family at least is getting more money from your pay increase. They even send a new lute for you after you told them of the unfortunate event that resulted in the destruction of your last one. This gives you a little pleasure in a relatively joyless assignment.\n\nAll in all, you still prefer it compared to being in the unsuccessful assaults on Nuro. The Grand Alliance that was formed hasn’t been too successful as every one has been a slaughter from what you’ve heard. You already went through that once. You don’t relish the idea of going through it again.\n\nOne day while you’re spending your free time practicing a new song, some new soldiers come into the fort. They look like they’ve just seen a vicious battle and are here to restock. One of them sees you and gives you a disapproving look. It’s a woman with striking good looks, but definitely carrying an air of leadership about her. Her rank signifies her as a captain…yep same cookie cutter, just a little prettier.\n\n“You there! What are you doing playing an instrument? Shouldn’t you be on watch or doing something more constructive with your time soldier? And you’re a sergeant? You should know better!”\n“I’m not on watch duty right now and…”\n\nThe woman doesn’t even let you finish your explanation. Other soldiers that were sitting in your area are now slowly creeping out of the fray. Even her own soldiers are creeping away. They probably know all too well of how she acts.\n\n“So? You think evil is going to wait around for you to be ready for battle? Where is your superior officer? I can’t believe they would allow such a relaxed attitude around here considering the importance of this fort! If you were serving under me, I’d have you flogged for your lack of discipline!”\n","page 2":"You’re not sure if the formal military life is for you. If you joined up you wouldn’t be able to readily leave. You figure if you don’t like life as a mercenary or it isn’t working out for you, you can leave freely.\n\nYou explain your decision to join up with the mercenary company that’s currently passing through. Your revelation comes as a shock. Your smaller brothers and sisters don’t want you to go, your brother Mallack really doesn’t want you to leave since he’ll be next in line to take the brunt of the manual labor!\n\nYour mother is a little apprehensive about your decision. You half expect her to say no, but she understands that you’re doing this for the good of the family. She gives her blessing.\n\nBefore you leave the next day with your packed belongings, your whole family comes to say goodbye to you. You almost hesitate to leave, wondering if it would actually be better for you to stay. Your mother approaches you.\n\n“You don’t have to do this you know. We’re doing just fine.”\n“Yeah, but things would be easier if this family had more money.”\n“Hah. Things are always easier with more money son, but you don’t need to go and get yourself killed for it.”\n“Yeah, I know, but I’ve thought it through.”\n“Very well, you’re old enough to make your own decisions and live your own life, though I’m glad to see that you still want to help the family as opposed to just leaving in the middle of the night.”\n“I’ll visit and return with whatever my pay is whenever I can.”\n“I know…okay, you best get going. I think the mercenary company was leaving today.”\n\nYou make you way to the local tavern and catch them just as they’re getting ready leave. A lot of them look hung over.\n\n“Hey wait up…” you say in a slightly loud tone, causing one mean looking mercenary to snarl at you.\n“Shut the fuck up yokel! Shit, I got a splitting headache and it hurts like a sonofabitch.”\n“Sorry. Are you the leader of this company?”\n“Leader of these dickheads? Naw. The Boss is actually visiting his family in the Zalan capital. We’re going to meet up with him now and I suggest you get the fuck outta our way and not waste anymore of our time!”\n“But I want to join you guys.”\n\nThe mercenary you were speaking to looks at you then looks at a few of his buddies and begins to laugh louder than your voice which previously annoyed him.\n\n“HAHAHA HAHAHA! Y’hear that fellas? This yokel wants to join us! Thanks a lot, I needed a good laugh, now go fuck your pigs or whatever it is you farm types do.”\n“But I’m serious…”\n“Serious? Farmboy, this is a man’s job and not for the fuckin’ weak. You ever even use a damn weapon?”\n“Yeah! I got this bow and this sword! I’m a really good shot!”\n\nThe mercenary still looks unimpressed.\n\n“Uh huh, yeah well you ever kill anyone, hell you ever kill ANYTHING? And I’m not talkin’ about any of your livestock you might’ve slaughtered. I mean something sentient.”\n“Well yeah, I’ve killed Kobolds that were trying to steal chickens from the…”\n\nThe mercenaries begin to laugh again.\n\n“Oh shit, you are priceless boy! My sister can kill fuckin’ Kobolds and her only talent is whoring.”\n“Haha got that one right, Dimitri.” Another one of the mercenaries agrees.\n\nSuddenly the laughing stops.\n\n“What the fuck did you just say Fermeli?”\n“Uh, I was just agreeing with you…c’mon don’t take it like that! I mean you said…”\n“Ain’t about what I said, it’s about what YOU said! You called my fucking sister a whore! You ain’t getting’ away with that shit.”\n\nDimitri draws his sword and stomps over to Fermeli who is trying to get one of his buddies to help him, but everyone else is backing away from the fight. Dimitri takes advantage of Fermeli’s state of panic and slashes him good with his sword.\n\nFermeli cries out in pain and begs for forgiveness. Dimitri looks like he’s going to finish him off, but then turns to you.\n\n“You want to join hayseed? Kill this piece of shit then.”\n“Huh? I mean…” you utter in confusion.\n“Did I stutter pig farmer? Kill this… AARGH FUCK!”\n\nFermeli has now taken advantage of Dimitri by shoving a dagger into his leg and scrambling to get up\n\n“Yeah! Take that! How’s that feel?” Fermeli taunts and draws his own sword in an attempt to kill Dimitri\n\nAt this point you unwisely step into the middle of this fight.\n\n“Hey hold on, the pair of you are even now…”\n“Fuck off pig farmer! You want some of this now? Yeah, let’s see how much of a killer you are!” Fermeli says who doesn’t look frightened of you at all and heads in your direction.\n\n“Hey wait I don’t wanna…”\n\nYou barely dodge his sword swipe to your head. You roll out of the way and quickly grab an arrow and shoot it at Fermeli with your bow, hitting him square in the neck. Some blood spurts out and a surprised look on his face is displayed and then he falls dead. You’ve killed him. You’ve never killed anything before that wasn’t a Kobold or livestock. You feel weird.\n\nIn the meantime Dimitri gets up and pulls the dagger out of his leg and looks over at Formeli’s body.\n\n“Heh, maybe you are a killer after all pig farmer. Well it seems we got an opening now. Take whatever he had as your own. You killed him, you earned it. Welcome to the Chimera Mercenary Company!”\n\nWhile you MAY be in, you’re not necessarily sure if you want in. This may be a bit too much for you.\n","page 105":"You have to admit, the idea has crossed your mind a bit. A small part of you does wonder about embracing the whole hero image and deliberately doing grand deeds that go beyond the call of your duty. You suppose that you’d at least really feel like one if you did that.\n\nHowever, more often than not real heroes don’t live long. You’re wondering what exactly this Mr. Warnov has in mind for you and given his demeanor, his appearance and just your own feelings of uncertainty about him, you decline. You know your limitations even if others don’t see them. So, no you won’t be hunting down some artifact of unlimited power and then single handedly taking out a Demon Lord or Necromancer Lord in their own throne room.\n\n“No, I don’t think so Mr. Warnov. As I’ve often said, I’m no hero. I’m just doing my job and providing for my family.”\n\nMr. Warnov looks disappointed and sighs, but accepts your decision.\n\n“Very well. This is a shame though. Despite your humble birth you seem to have lots of potential. You could’ve made an excellent addition to our…organization. I’ve also heard your lute playing wasn’t bad either, we don’t have any musically talented types anymore…oh well.”\n\nMr. Warnov leaves rather quickly after his last statement. Something about him seemed very odd and you’re sort of glad you didn’t take his offer. You go back to your target practice for awhile when you suddenly hear an alarm cry out loudly through the fort about a small demon army being sighted over the hill.\n\n“Well back to work…” you say and prepare for battle once again.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nIt’s been five years since the Nuro Incident and things have gotten worse.\n\nBoth the Necromancer Lord and Velzix have made progress. Too much. The Grand Alliance hasn’t been able to do anything except fight them to a stalemate. All three sides are looking to gain an advantage and somehow you don’t think it’ll be yours.\n\nThe Zalan Empire has become increasingly totalitarian. It’s been increasing its influence over how the Grand Alliance should be run and its strategies. Some of Zalan’s officers have been transferred to become more prominent in leading and commanding the bulk of the Grand Alliance army. You’re not sure if this isn’t a bad idea. Bullying or not, one final voice in matters would probably help the Grand Alliance at this point. There’s been some grumbling by other nations though.\n\nHowever it’s also begun several repressive internal measures to keep itself safe. Your mom has mentioned in letters back to you of seeing routine patrols now near the farm. Talks of seizing private property for the good of the Empire are being discussed. You don’t really like the sound of that, but it’s not really like you can do anything about it. You can only take solace in the fact that being part of the Zalan army will at least result in your family not becoming homeless. They would probably still be able to live and work on the farm…it just wouldn’t be your family’s anymore. There’s also talk of a draft. You don’t like the sound of that either. Your brother Mallack would certainly be conscripted now. You can’t imagine him dealing with the things you’ve had to face. You hope it doesn’t come to that.\n\nYour position at Virtue is looking worse and worse each day. Parts of the fort are severely damaged, you’re short on man power and you don’t even have any decent wizards or healers. You’ve attempted to talk to Captain Eckard about withdrawing and falling back to a safer position, but he won’t hear of it. This fort is NOT to be abandoned.\n\nThe only good thing is that there’s apparently been a small contingent of mercenaries severely messing up things for Velzix in his own territory. They must be incredibly brave or completely mad for Zalan gold to perform such a task. You can’t help but think that maybe YOU would be there right along side them, if you’d joined up with that mercenary company years ago. A sobering thought.\n\nTime to go on patrol again. You gather up some soldiers and get ready. You look at all of them and wonder which ones won’t be coming back this time. You look at yourself and wonder if you will. A few years ago, everyone coming back alive was at least a possibility, but now it’s not even certain.\n\nYou go out and change up your routine path again. Always have to be different, can’t become predictable.\n\nA couple of imps attack. Nothing to worry about. Easily dispatched. You know you’ll encounter worse before the day is over though.\n\nA group of Tulan “citizens” led by their demon overseer attacks you next. Made up of hapless slaves and misguided idiots who think serving the demons is going to pan out in the long run.\n\nFinally you come across something a little more unusual. A small group of dwarves fighting off a large demon ambush. They look ragged, wounded and in dire need of help. So you help them.\n\nYou unleash five arrows into the head of an Eviscerator before two of your number are fried by a hellfire blast from a Flame Child. The fighting doesn’t get any cleaner from there. You see another one of your members getting shredded, before a path is cleared for the dwarves to follow you back to the fort. One of their own chooses to stay behind to give the rest a chance to escape. As all of you run, a large explosion is heard followed by several yelps, howls and screams. The dwarf has blown himself up with whatever explosives the dwarves are fond of making.\n\nFinally you get back to the fort where it’s relatively safe, and all you’re thinking about is how you’ll have to do this all over again tomorrow. You retire to your private room where you play your lute and hope you aren’t disturbed by another attack on the fort. Happily, that doesn’t happen, but you are disturbed by one of the dwarves you rescued earlier instead. He’s come to thank you.\n\n“Hey lad, I just want to say thanks to your actions at least a few of us survived from our clan. Such as it is now. Something about you looks very familiar. Normally you humans all look the same but…ah hah! You’re that lad who I saved near that farm five years ago! Looks like you returned the favor! Stagir’s the name.”\n\nYou didn’t realize it either, but then with all the fighting and the chaos you’d barely survived during that particular day, you weren’t really paying attention to faces. You were just glad someone came along when they did.\n\n“Yeah…small world I guess. So what happened to your clan?”\n“Wiped out lad.” Stagir says mournfully. “At least when you humans were fighting each other you didn’t mess with us, but getting caught between the undead and demons…well it’s a bit different.”\n“The undead are that far now?” you ask.\n“Aye. They and the demons have been involved in skirmishes here and there. Got no problem with evil fighting evil, but it was just our bad luck that my clan was caught in the middle. The demons are evil incarnate to be sure, but the undead…I dunno. Something worse about them. In the final days, I had to kill clan members who I once called friends and family because of the fucking necromancers raising them from the dead. Some stayed behind to fight since they refused to run. They’d rather die than run from their home. Normally I’d agree, but after seeing that this was a losing battle, some of us decided that it would be better to run. After all we would just be raised again to be used as puppets of the necromancers when we die. Not even free will to choose, or the threat of a demon’s whip. You just become one of them. Can’t let that happen to me. Never.”\n\nYou know something of it, having had to do a little of that five years ago at Nuro, but actually killing undead parodies of family members would be pretty horrific.\n\nStagir attempts to lighten the mood a bit by asking you about what you were playing before he interrupted. When you tell him, he tiches and says something about how elven songs are nothing compared to dwarven ones. You never really thought of dwarves having a musical interest before, but Stagir boasts about how they have quite an extensive musical history.\n\nHe takes the lute from you and shows you a couple of dwarven songs, breaking strings in the process. His insistent singing accompanying the songs isn’t exactly pleasant either. He complains about the human made strings not being strong enough to play the songs properly, but thanks you again for saving his life before leaving.\n\nEvery now and then you play these songs for your new dwarven allies who have taken it upon themselves to strengthen and rebuild the fort the “proper dwarf way”. They seem to appreciate it. You’re a little more careful with the strings and don’t indulge in the singing though. (But unfortunately for the rest of the fort, the dwarves do)\n\nA few months pass and the demon attacks seem to decrease. The strengthened fort certainly helps, but something else is going on. Eventually you’re seeing less and less of them. Eventually some ragged refugees come to the fort and after a bit of babbling and thanking the gods, a few of them explain.\n\nThere are a couple of conflicting stories, but it would seem Velzix is dead! He was killed by something or someone. Consensus seems to be that the mercenary leader died in battle with him though. Without Velzix’s leadership the demons are fighting amongst themselves and the realm is in complete disarray. The Grand Alliance is taking steps to retake the land immediately before the Necromancer Lord gets it. The Zalan Empire in particular is closer though, so naturally YOUR nation is going to get that land first!\n\nWhile things may be looking up somewhat, they aren’t necessarily looking up for you. Captain Eckard has orders to begin an attack immediately. You aren’t looking forward to it mainly because you’ll probably encounter an undead army in the process.\n\nYou don’t have a choice though except for what role you can serve. Thanks to your skills and rank. You can either lead troops as normal, or be part of a scouting party.\n","page 1":"Well, as much as you’re going to hate the whole uniform thing, you’d rather there be some sort of guidelines. The mercenaries look like a rough bunch. You get the impression\nyou’d have to be watching your back as much as your enemies if you signed up with them.\n\nYou explain your decision to join the army to the family one night at dinner. Your revelation comes as a shock. Your smaller brothers and sisters don’t want you to go, your\nbrother Mallack really doesn’t want you to leave since he’ll be next in line to take the brunt of the manual labor!\n\nYour mother surprises you as much as you surprised everyone else. You expected her to be the most vocal about you not leaving, but she sees that this would help out the family. She gives her blessing.\n\nBefore you leave the next day with your packed belongings, your whole family comes to say goodbye to you. You almost hesitate to leave, wondering if it would actually be better for you to stay, but your mother urges you on.\n\n“Don’t worry! Mallack is old enough to take over your responsibilities on the farm. He’s not quite as skilled of a hunter, but he’ll be able to do it. I’ve always known that you’ve had a desire to travel. The army isn’t an ideal life I hope you realize though.” Your mom says.\n“Yeah, I know, but I’ve thought it through.”\n“Very well, you’re old enough to make your own decisions and live your own life, though I’m glad to see that you still want to help the family as opposed to just leaving in the middle of the night.”\n“I’ll start sending money as soon as possible. I’ll also try to write and visit when I can.”\n“I know…okay, you best get going. It’s still quite a walk to the capitol.”\n\nYou begin to leave the farm as your family wave goodbye to you in the distance.\n\nSoon you’re on the road to your nation’s capitol. You’ve been to Zal once before a long time ago with your dad when he was trying to sell some kobold eyes to an alchemist there. You remember being overwhelmed with how many people lived there and how big it was. You always did want to go there again one day; you just didn’t think it would be to enlist in the army.\n\nEventually you arrive at Zal. The place is even bigger than the last time you came here. So much has changed and you’re a little overwhelmed. You don’t have any knowledge of the city so you ask the gate guard who is giving a watchful look to everyone coming in and out.\n\n“Excuse me…”\n”Whadda ya want peasant? I’m busy! Market square is three blocks down as soon as you get inside the gate here!” The guard snaps.\n“No, I was wondering where I could enlist in the army.”\n\nThe guard seems to change his tone to a somewhat more cordial tone.\n\n“Oh I see. Well, as soon as you go through the gate, take a left, and walk two blocks. The recruiting office is on the right hand side across from a general store.”\n\nYou thank him and proceed, but you can’t help overhearing the guard laughing to his buddy as you walk away. You don’t make out all of it, but “Dumb fucking hayseed peasant.” was definitely in there.\n\nAt last you arrive at the recruiting office. The man sitting at the desk looks bored at first, but perks up a bit when he sees you.\n\n“Well now, this is a nice break in the monotony. Have a seat.”\n“I want to enlist in the army.”\n“Well of course you do son, why else would you be here? To join the Zalan Empire’s best right? Okay, but before we start I need to ask you some questions just so we can get a feel of where we think you’ll best serve in the Emperor’s glorious army.”\n“Uh, okay.”\n“Good, so where are you from son? You certainly don’t look like you’re from the city here. You look like a farmer.”\n“Well I sort of am sir. My family owns a farm a couple miles from the city, I decided to enlist to help my family monetarily. Times are hard on the farm.”\n“Mmm, noble of you. Your sense of duty will also serve you well too. Any combat experience?”\n“Some, but nothing major I’m afraid. A few bandits. Kobolds in the chicken coop. That’s about it.”\n“Don’t worry you’ll learn to be a killing machine, but your past experience are more than some we’ve recruited. Any other talents?”\n“Besides farming? Um…I’m a good hunter, I use this bow all the time!” you say and show the recruiter your worn bow.\n“Good. Good. We can always use good marksmen. But you’ll get the chance to use a better bow than that old thing you’ve been carrying around. What’s that other thing on your back?”\n“Oh this? Well this is my uh lute.”\n“Lute? Ha ha! You a bard or something?”\n“Well not really, but…”\n“You planning on charming the enemies with your music?”\n“Uh…” you say begin to get a little anxious.\n“Hah! Settle down son, I’m just messing with you. But I’m afraid whatever your musical hobbies may be you’ll most likely be abandoning them. Can’t be picking your lute while an angry ogre is charging at you or you’re storming a castle. This is the army, not an entertainment company!”\n\nThe recruiter at this point begins to look through some papers and grabs one after looking it over.\n\n“Ah. Here it is…you know how to read and write?”\n“YES!” you say indignantly for the first time.\n“Okay, okay, don’t get testy. Its just most of you peasant farmer types don’t. Anyway just sign here and we’ll get you started on your basic training.”\n\nYou take the paper, and give it a pointless look over like you actually understand all the legal mumbo jumbo and sign. The recruiter takes the paper from you and then shakes your hand.\n\n“Congratulations son! You’re in the Zalan Army now! The best damn one in this world!”\n\nSomehow he’s more enthusiastic than you are…\n","page 104":"You have to admit, the idea has crossed your mind a bit.

You can only take solace in the fact that being part of the Zalan army will at least result in your family not becoming homeless. They would probably still be able to live and work on the farm…it just wouldn’t be your family’s anymore. There’s also talk of a draft. You don’t like the sound of that either. Your brother Mallack would certainly be conscripted now. You can’t imagine him dealing with the things you’ve had to face. You hope it doesn’t come to that.\n\nYour position at Virtue is looking worse and worse each day. Parts of the fort are severely damaged, you’re short on man power and you don’t even have any decent wizards or healers. You’ve attempted to talk to Captain Eckard about withdrawing and falling back to a safer position, but he won’t hear of it. This fort is NOT to be abandoned.\n\nThe only good thing is that there’s apparently been a small contingent of mercenaries severely messing up things for Velzix in his own territory. They must be incredibly brave or completely mad for Zalan gold to perform such a task. You can’t help but think that maybe YOU would be there right along side them, if you’d joined up with that mercenary company years ago. A sobering thought.\n\nTime to go on patrol again. You gather up some soldiers and get ready. You look at all of them and wonder which ones won’t be coming back this time. You look at yourself and wonder if you will. A few years ago, everyone coming back alive was at least a possibility, but now it’s not even certain.\n\nYou go out and change up your routine path again. Always have to be different, can’t become predictable.\n\nA couple of imps attack. Nothing to worry about. Easily dispatched. You know you’ll encounter worse before the day is over though.\n\nA group of Tulan “citizens” led by their demon overseer attacks you next. Made up of hapless slaves and misguided idiots who think serving the demons is going to pan out in the long run.\n\nFinally you come across something a little more unusual. A small group of dwarves fighting off a large demon ambush. They look ragged, wounded and in dire need of help. So you help them.\n\nYou unleash five arrows into the head of an Eviscerator before two of your number are fried by a hellfire blast from a Flame Child. The fighting doesn’t get any cleaner from there. You see another one of your members getting shredded, before a path is cleared for the dwarves to follow you back to the fort. One of their own chooses to stay behind to give the rest a chance to escape. As all of you run, a large explosion is heard followed by several yelps, howls and screams. The dwarf has blown himself up with whatever explosives the dwarves are fond of making.\n\nFinally you get back to the fort where it’s relatively safe, and all you’re thinking about is how you’ll have to do this all over again tomorrow. You retire to your private room where you play your lute and hope you aren’t disturbed by another attack on the fort. Happily, that doesn’t happen, but you are disturbed by one of the dwarves you rescued earlier instead. He’s come to thank you.\n\n“Hey lad, I just want to say thanks to your actions at least a few of us survived from our clan. Such as it is now. Something about you looks very familiar. Normally you humans all look the same but…ah hah! You’re that lad who I saved near that farm five years ago! Looks like you returned the favor! Stagir’s the name.”\n\nYou didn’t realize it either, but then with all the fighting and the chaos you’d barely survived during that particular day, you weren’t really paying attention to faces. You were just glad someone came along when they did.\n\n“Yeah…small world I guess. So what happened to your clan?”\n“Wiped out lad.” Stagir says mournfully. “At least when you humans were fighting each other you didn’t mess with us, but getting caught between the undead and demons…well it’s a bit different.”\n“The undead are that far now?” you ask.\n“Aye. They and the demons have been involved in skirmishes here and there. Got no problem with evil fighting evil, but it was just our bad luck that my clan was caught in the middle. The demons are evil incarnate to be sure, but the undead…I dunno. Something worse about them. In the final days, I had to kill clan members who I once called friends and family because of the fucking necromancers raising them from the dead. Some stayed behind to fight since they refused to run. They’d rather die than run from their home. Normally I’d agree, but after seeing that this was a losing battle, some of us decided that it would be better to run. After all we would just be raised again to be used as puppets of the necromancers when we die. Not even free will to choose, or the threat of a demon’s whip. You just become one of them. Can’t let that happen to me. Never.”\n\nYou know something of it, having had to do a little of that five years ago at Nuro, but actually killing undead parodies of family members would be pretty horrific.\n\nStagir attempts to lighten the mood a bit by asking you about what you were playing before he interrupted. When you tell him, he tiches and says something about how elven songs are nothing compared to dwarven ones. You never really thought of dwarves having a musical interest before, but Stagir boasts about how they have quite an extensive musical history.\n\nHe takes the lute from you and shows you a couple of dwarven songs, breaking strings in the process. His insistent singing accompanying the songs isn’t exactly pleasant either. He complains about the human made strings not being strong enough to play the songs properly, but thanks you again for saving his life before leaving.\n\nEvery now and then you play these songs for your new dwarven allies who have taken it upon themselves to strengthen and rebuild the fort the “proper dwarf way”. They seem to appreciate it. You’re a little more careful with the strings and don’t indulge in the singing though. (But unfortunately for the rest of the fort, the dwarves do)\n\nA few months pass and the demon attacks seem to decrease. The strengthened fort certainly helps, but something else is going on. Eventually you’re seeing less and less of them. Eventually some ragged refugees come to the fort and after a bit of babbling and thanking the gods, a few of them explain.\n\nThere are a couple of conflicting stories, but it would seem Velzix is dead! He was killed by something or someone. Consensus seems to be that the mercenary leader died in battle with him though. Without Velzix’s leadership the demons are fighting amongst themselves and the realm is in complete disarray. The Grand Alliance is taking steps to retake the land immediately before the Necromancer Lord gets it. The Zalan Empire in particular is closer though, so naturally YOUR nation is going to get that land first!\n\nWhile things may be looking up somewhat, they aren’t necessarily looking up for you. Captain Eckard has orders to begin an attack immediately. You aren’t looking forward to it mainly because you’ll probably encounter an undead army in the process.\n\nYou don’t have a choice though except for what role you can serve. Thanks to your skills and rank. You can either lead troops as normal, or be part of a scouting party.\n","page 4":"If this how it was on your first day, you’d hate to think about if you had to deal with this on a regular basis.\n\n“Uh…no, maybe I was wrong. Bye.” You say and quickly take off.\n“Heh, pig farmer don’t have no stomach for it…Dibs on Foremeli’s shit!” you hear Dimitri yell.\n\nWhen you get back home, your family and mom in particular ask what happened, you explain it and say you don’t want any part of that life. You apologize that you couldn’t go through with it, but your mom looks more relieved than anything.\n\n“Well son, I’m just as glad you didn’t join up with that lot anyway. You’ll be helping us out plenty just by working on the farm like always.”\n\nYou’re glad to hear that. Over the next couple days you fall back into routine again. You still wonder about the future though and you briefly consider the army plan again, but given your short lived experience with mercenary “life” you don’t think you’re cut out with battle on a regular basis. Plus the Zalan Empire is currently having really bad border skirmish with the Tulan Kingdom right now.\n\nYou resign yourself to the farm life. You play your lute to yourself (and family) when you have the time to do so. It’s a simple life.\n\nA year passes and a terrible incident occurs at a far away city known as Nuro. A group of rogue wizards summoned an army of the dead to take it over. They also summoned a lot of demons that have broken free and running rampant now in the Tulan Kingdom. It’s all far away from you, but something like this is pretty serious. Necromancy and Demon summoning is strictly forbidden throughout the land.\n\nMeanwhile life on the farm is going the same as it ever did. Hard sometimes, but manageable.\n\nAnother two years pass and things have gotten worse. The Necromancer Lord (as he’s become to be known) has expanded, even to the point of taking over the Brot Kingdom. The Tulan Kingdom has been totally conquered by a demon army. A Grand Alliance of nations has been formed, but so far they don’t seem to be making much progress.\n\nMeanwhile life on the farm is a little harder. Your youngest sister Makana becomes gravely ill during the winter months, but there’s not enough money to pay for a healer and most of the clerics have been summoned to battle with the undead or demon hordes. Sadly she dies making the overall mood of the farm a little more depressing. You don’t even play anymore, your enthusiasm for music died along with the grim realities setting in.\n\nAnother three years pass and things are down right miserable. War is everywhere. The Demons have been taken care of, but the undead are stronger than ever. Reports even speak of the Necromancer Lord becoming The Great Lich Lord “reborn”. You remember hearing tales by your father of such a being that existed centuries ago. They scared the hell out of you then and the fact that you’re living in a time where he’s returned makes you feel doomed.\n\nTo make things worse, the Zalan Empire has been becoming increasingly tyrannical. In order to help with the war effort they’ve started bringing back the draft and the talk of ceasing private property to be used for the good of the government. While they say owners will be able to live and still work on their lands and businesses, it will be owned by the Empire.\n\nYou know it’s only a matter of time when you get a knock on the door by Zalan army troops coming to take you and your brother Mallack away to the army and your family’s farm.\n\nAnother two year pass…\n\nYou’re on the eve of battle in a land known as the Garwold Confederacy although it’s steadily becoming a giant graveyard now. The undead hordes have been sweeping relentlessly across the entire landscape. Your own company has had to fall back several times. Morale is low. Not that yours was high to begin with. You don’t even know how you’ve survived this long. You didn’t even have that much military training when they threw you into you first battle a year ago. It was a terrifying experience and you still have nightmares about it. The undead…you’ll never get used to fighting such emotionless creatures that are the embodiment of death and all that’s unnatural.\n\nYou briefly wonder if your brother Mallack is alright where he’s stationed, but it hardly matters at this point.\n\nBattle comes as it always does and you are not so lucky this time. Horrible and powerful creatures known as Blood Specters and Death Knights utterly destroy your side.\n\nYou fall to undead blades and chilling touches only rise up and join them in their goal of global genocide.\n","page 107":"You can’t take it anymore.\n\n“I’M NOT A FUCKING HERO! OKAY!? I NEVER WAS AND I NEVER WANTED TO BE! (sob)… I just wanted to go home…(sob)”\n\nYou weep for a few minutes before the captain speaks again.\n\n“Alright then what happened? Tell me the entire truth and maybe you’ll avoid the executioner’s axe.”\n\nAt this point you have little choice. You’re too distraught to say anything else. You give a relatively condensed version of what happened. At Nuro and what happened recently. Your encounter with Warnov seems to surprise her quite a bit. You also go on to explain that it was high ranking Zalan officers that insisted on this hero nonsense. She believes you, like she knows something of it.\n\n“(sigh) Yeah there’s a statue of my dad in the Zalan capitol…but I know better…”\n\nYou don’t question anymore about this quiet outburst from her since you’re still too worried about what’s going to happen to you.\n\n“So why did you come back? You probably could’ve gotten away with it.”\n“The same reason why I joined. My family. I guess I just needed a reminder of that first hand. And if there’s any hope of changing the tide of this war with the undead then I need to stand by my decision of joining the Zalan Army and making the world safer for them.”\n\nOnce again the captain seems to soften. She almost looks like she’s going to tear up as well, but she turns away.\n\n“My family…I…” are all she says before taking a deep breath and turning back towards you, with a serious mindset again.\n\n“Alright, I shall trust your word for now sergeant, but I will be watching you VERY carefully! Consider yourself lucky for evading death once again, perhaps you do have knack for avoiding it. Let us hope that luck rubs off on the rest of us in the upcoming battle. I’m putting you in charge of the Retlad archery platoon. They’ll probably like you. Dismissed.”\n\nBefore you leave she says one last thing.\n\n“And sergeant, don’t listen to what that bizarre vampire said. We’re not going to become extinct. We’re going to win and survive a long time. Besides you still have to play that song for me.”\n\nAs you leave you feel a sigh of relief that you won’t be dying just yet, but given that you’re heading into battle soon with the undead, you’re wondering if you just didn’t postpone the inevitable.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nSeven years since the Nuro Incident changed the world into this living hell.\n\nYour time served in the Grand Alliance has not really changed much. The Grand Alliance and the Zalan Empire are basically one of the same now thanks to the complete embrace of a totalitarian system. Might makes right. Nations like the Azi Republic protested, but there was little that they could, after all Zalan has been practically defending the world by itself for the past few years. You get the impression that if this war is won; the Zalan Empire is going to throw its hat in to be a one world government.\n\nAmazing how power and conspiracy is plotted even when it probably won’t happen. “Probably won’t” because your superiors and political leaders are a lot more “optimistic” about winning than you are, but then they haven’t had to face the horrors you’ve faced.\n\nAnd horrors are a completely accurate word. You’ve gotten over your fear of the undead, but it doesn’t make it any easier. You’re starting to lose ground. Everyday the living lose someone, the Great Lich Lord gains. It’s a question of numbers and quite frankly your side doesn’t have them.\n\nYou sort of wish your old captain was here. She was a very good leader and inspirational, but then again that’s why she was made a general and sent elsewhere. She asked you to play that song before she left though. Somehow it seemed to make her sadder afterwards.\n\n“Captain, undead are on the move, they won’t be long now.” One of your messengers says.\n“Yes, I can sense it. Here. You head back to my home. You know where it is by now, and give this message to my family. If you get back here and see undead, well get the fuck out and run back to Zalan territory.”\n\nBeing a captain hasn’t really turned you into a copy of the captains you served in the past, but then again you didn’t even think you’d ever be promoted to one. Your reign as one has been a little unorthodox as you’ve applied more guerilla tactics than traditional ones, but given your assignment and your background it makes a hell of a lot more sense.\n\nYou’re currently stationed on what remains of the Garwold Confederacy. It was a relatively peaceful nation made up mostly of Halflings and Gnomes, with lush green fields and flowers. Now it’s just slowly becoming another massive graveyard and example of genocide.\n\nYou’ve gotten to know quite a few of them and you’re always amazed of how they can keep their sense of humor in the face of utter destruction. One of them actually gives you an answer.\n\n“To keep from crying.”\n\nIndeed. You’ve been playing quite a bit when you’re not battling the undead. (The Garwold citizens enjoy your playing a lot) It’s gotten to the point where you don’t just play anymore to keep your mind off of things, it’s like it transports you to a different world. A better world.\n\nIf only.\n\nYou often wonder how your brother Mallack is doing. He’s been stationed in a relatively safer location back in Zalan territory. You’re guessing that it lowers the odds of having your mom lose both of her sons at the same time. Like it makes it any better if she lost them within any length on time of each other. You wonder if the war is going to go on long enough that by the time Calwin grows up he’ll be drafted as well.\n\nIf he even gets the chance to grow up.\n\nYou can’t think about it now. A massive undead horde is coming and there’s no where left to hide. There will be open battle and you need to stay focused.\n\nYou go through the whole order thing, and making sure your strategy is sound. You wish you had more wizards, but they seem to be in shorter supply these days. It’s almost like they’re being targeted deliberately sometimes…actually you don’t think it, you KNOW that they are.\n\nYou see the undead horde approach. You look through some new fangled dwarven invention called an eye piece and see something makes your job a hell of a lot worse.\n\nYou don’t just see the usual undead. You see fully armored Death Knights. Harder to kill than even a zombie giant. You see Blood Specters. Dark crimson spirits that can cause their victims to bleed from every orifice with their shrieks. Both of those are at the head of this horde, and this isn’t even counting that you’re severely outnumbered by just the regular zombies, skeletons, ghosts and the like.\n","page 3":"You know this isn’t going to be easy and you’re going to have to be tough, but you remember that you’re doing this for your family. You quickly search Formeli’s body, which didn’t have that much to begin with.\n\n“Heh, he always was a broke bastard. Spent all his money on gambling, I’ll miss taking his money that’s for sure. Alright then, you’ll probably be wantin’ to take that sword of his since it looks in way better condition than your rusted hunk of iron. Your bow seems to do the job just fine though. His armor too, and hurry up, we gotta meet the Boss! He’s got another job for us no doubt.”\n\nAs you’re stripping off some of the armor, Dimitri notices something on your back.\n\n“What…what the hell is that boy? Is that a fuckin’ lute? Haw haw! What the fuck are you doin’ with a damn lute? You think that you’re some sort of bard or something? We ain’t got need for such things boy! Get rid of it!”\n“No, it’s mine.” You defiantly say.\nYou wonder if this show of “courage” has gotten you into a whole mess of trouble that you don’t want, but fortunately it doesn’t.\n\n“Heh, he kills one shithead and now he thinks he’s a tough guy! Alright pig farmer keep your sissy lute. But its just more weight for you to carry and you better not be falling behind! Come on men let’s go, the Boss is waiting for us. You too lute boy!” Dimitri exclaims and limps off. You briefly thought about telling him that he better keep up with his wounded leg and all, but you know when to stop.\n\nAnd so your mercenary life begins.\n\nA year passes…\n\nYou’re currently back in the Zalan Empire on a break in between missions. While most of your “buddies” are drinking up their pay and spending it on whores you take this opportunity to visit your family and give them your payment and spoils of battle as usual.\n\nYou think about how much you’ve traveled and experienced. Not all of it good, but then killing is never pretty. Some of the jobs are very straight forward: “There are some orc barbarians on the borders that have been pillaging our lands, kill them.” And you don’t have a problem with it. Other missions start falling into the “gray” area.\n\nYour last job involved some Azi Republic senator hiring the company to take out some secessionists that wanted to form their own country. It wasn’t clean and it definitely wasn’t fun. The secessionists actually had a reasonable complaint about leaving the Republic, saying that it was corrupt and that their representatives didn’t care about them. But being a mercenary means you don’t take sides for moral or ideological reasons, you do it for money.\n\nIt’s not just that though, some of the things that have been done…well you can’t say you’re too proud of it. Granted, you’ve never actively engaged in some of the less moral and outright criminal things that your mercenary comrades have, but you certainly know about them and it almost makes you feel like you’re guilty of it as well.\n\nAs for how you cope with some of this stuff, you tend to keep to yourself and play your lute which has oddly made you a little more accepted. Seems there are more than a few music lovers in the company. Even the Captain doesn’t mind you indulging in your little hobby. The Captain is a huge man who you know gets a pleasure from killing and mayhem. He’s spent a lifetime doing it. In fact you have a hard time believing he even has a family that he goes to visit. Who knows though? Perhaps he is different with them.\n\n(You’ve been working for the Chimera Company for a year and you still don’t know what the hell his real name is, mainly because everyone only seems to address him as “The Boss” or “Chief” or in a more formal tone “Captain”)\n\nYou spend the time with your family and tell them of some of the things you’ve seen and exciting places you’ve been to, of course never going into too much detail about the darker side of things. Your brothers and sisters enjoy the tales as usual. Your Mom senses that there is probably more to them, but she doesn’t ask too many questions. She does always asks if you’re okay and says that you don’t have to keep doing it, but you always reply that you’re fine and that you’re just a little tired that’s all.\n\nWhen your time is done you say goodbye to them and meet with the rest of your company at the Zalan capital this time. Its odd, but things seem to be even more chaotic than usual around here. People are rushing around and an air of concern seems to be pervading the city.\n\nThe guards are telling people to calm down our there will be martial law and you hear something in passing about an attack on a city. You don’t really listen because you’re in a hurry to meet up with your company which you find mostly hanging out in a tavern as usual.\n\nDimitri sees you and speaks.\n\n“Ah, it’s our own fuckin’ bard ! How’s my favorite string plucker? (Hic!) You have trouble getting into the city? Heard the guards have been cracking down on security.”\n“No, but what’s going on? The city seems to be in a state of panic.”\n“Fuck yeah it is! What you didn’t hear?”\n“No. What happened?”\n“Fuckin’ undead happened my pig farming friend! A whole shitload of them took over the the city of Nuro! Can you believe it? Fuckin’ Nuro! That place was supposed to be unconquerable! Heh! (Burp!)” Dimitri says without the slightest bit of worry.\n“UNDEAD?! What the fuck? Nuro!? How?!”\n“Fuck if I know, guess some rogue wizards got hooked up in that necromancy shit hardcore. Musta been some demonologists there too since we heard reports of demons too. Not the supposedly civilized type either, they’re the rip off your head and shit down your neck kind.”\n“…there’s fuckin’ rogue demons in Nuro too?”\n“Of course not, they all escaped and are now running around in the countryside, heard they’re heading for the Tulan Kingdom.” Dimitri says taking another drink.\n\nYou’re having a hard time digesting all this yet the rest of your comrades are still drinking and partying like nothing is wrong. Your Dad had once told you tales of a being called the Great Lich Lord that existed many centuries ago who nearly killed the world. Scared the hell out of you then and it doesn’t make you feel too good now.\n\n“Isn’t this concerning to you?”\n“What? Shit no! Just means more work for us and that also means more loot! Ha ha! You could get more loot to buy a new lute! Ha ha ha! (Hic!)”\n“But this is the fuckin’ undead! I mean…”\n“So? Stop bein a pussy! I’ve fought some undead before, when I was lootin’ a dwarven tomb. You just chop their heads off like everything else, shit ain’t that hard. They just tend to smell worse…well maybe not worse than trolls. Anyway I’m sure the fucking governments will take care of this shit as quick as possible, you know how politicians don’t like dead taxpayers, in the meantime we need to take advantage now while the conflict is hot!”\n\nNo sooner has Dimitri said this little bit of wisdom, when the Boss steps in the doorway. He’s as nasty looking as always, but this time he looks even moreso than usual.\n\n“Alright you useless sacks of goblin shit. We got a new job. This one just came across rather unexpectedly. Ran into a Dwarven representative and we’re now in the employ of a Dwarven Clan, near the southern Tulan Borders. With the occurrence of this Nuro incident, they’re expecting some shit to spill over into their lands and they want some extra help. This is pretty surprising since Dwarves aren’t known to pay for mercenaries, let alone the likes of us.” The Boss tell you all.\n“The Tulan Border? Oh fuck that place is a meat grinder! There’s no profit to be had anywhere near there!” Cal pipes up.\n“Well you can just pick up your panties and get your pansy ass back home and stay there then! The dwarves are paying well and that’s the job. Take it or get the fuck outta my company!”\n“Excuse me Captain, but weren’t there reports of demons running through that area?” you ask.\n“Yeah so? That’s why we’re going over there most likely, but be fucking prepared for any damn thing. Maybe even undead…who knows if my…if those necromancer bastards started spreading their plague yet. We leave tomorrow.”\n\nYou think on this fucked up situation and seriously reconsidering your career choice.\n","page 106":"If you’ve learned one thing, numbers doesn’t necessarily imply safety. With all the years of patrolling you’ve done along with your previous actions in Retlad so long ago, you actually feel more comfortable in smaller groups at this point. Your one and only rank and file battle didn’t go well.\n\nYour choice isn’t surprising, if anything more people feel comfortable with you scouting ahead.\n\nAs you journey further into former Tulan territory, you don’t encounter too much resistance. A few demons and crazed followers here and there, but nothing you can’t take care of. It also occurs to you how “planted” you’ve been for the past five years. While it’s true you did leave the fort a lot, you never ventured far from it. This is first time you’ve actually traveled. Ironic, since one of the reasons why you joined the army was the possibility of traveling to interesting places.\n\nHowever, it seems like you only visit these interesting places after they’re already destroyed. You’re basically seeing the aftermath of the demon occupation. It sort of reminds you of what you’d seen back in Retlad when the Quillars were killing folks except the landscape is in even worse condition. The demons weren’t content on just corrupting their mortal slaves; they were attempting to turn the entire land into their infernal realm. You can only imagine what sort of hell was going on while they were actually here.\n\nYou get to a small town that’s completely wrecked and seemingly deserted. Its night time and normally you’d go back and wait until morning to scout it, but Captain Eckard is insistent on getting to the former Tulan capital as quick as possible. You split up into small groups to scout the town quicker and tell everyone that if they come across anything more then they can handle, to run and alert everyone else.\n\nYou go building to building not really encountering much of anything. Not even survivors. Lots of half eaten dead bodies in various states of torment though. You expect when Velzix was killed the whole realm descended into anarchy pretty quickly and the demons reverted back to their chaotic natures causing as much mayhem as possible without too much repercussion.\n\nYou enter a shop with two of your other team members. You hear a creaking sound, which doesn’t sound good. One of your team members goes a little further in, and it gets louder.\n\n“Step back! The floors is…” you utter and then a large portion of the floor collapses underneath him. You attempt to grab his hand, but fail and the rest of the floor collapses underneath you as well.\n\nYou don’t fall too far, but you definitely feel it. You recover as quick as you can and hear your other subordinate who managed to avoid falling through the floor.\n\n“Sarge! Are you alright?” Private Ramusen shouts.\n“Yeah, yeah private. I’m just a little bruised.”\n“What about Gannon? Is he alright?”\n\nYou take your tinder box and make a small light. You look around and see that you must be in the basement of some sort of music shop from all the instruments you see. You didn’t even notice when you first entered the place, it just looked like any other ransacked shop.\n\nUpon further inspection you see a body lying on the floor. It’s Private Gannon and he’s dead. He didn’t land in the “good way” you did and broke his neck.\n\n“He’s dead.” You call up to Ramusen.\n“Shit! He’s fuckin’ dead?”\n“Yeah private, I just said he was! Now let me get the hell out of here…fuck! The damn stairs are completely destroyed. I can’t climb up, or even attempt a jump. Ramusen, throw down a rope and make sure you really secure it!”\n\nWhile you wait for Ramusen to complete this task, you take a look at some of the instruments. Lots of flutes and other wind instruments that don’t interest you. You grab an old looking mandolin. It’s definitely human design, but it seems very ornate though, must’ve been a specialty piece that wasn’t for sale.\n\nYou pluck at the strings and despite the dirt, grime, and neglect of the instrument; it still manages to produce a fairly pleasing tone. You play for a good five minutes before you realize that Ramusen hasn’t thrown down the rope yet.\n\n“Private?” is all you utter, when you hear the slumping of a lifeless body, followed by a low voice.\n\n“Beautiful…”\n\nYou grab your bow, when you see a dark figure loom above you. You fire, but miss due to the figure dodging quicker than anything you’ve ever encountered before. It doesn’t help that this same figure has jumped down the hole beside you before you can blink.\n\nYou’re standing right before the figure now. He has a pale, but familiar face, though the blood around the mouth is new and not encouraging. He knocks the bow out of your hand, but does nothing else to you. You wouldn’t be quick enough to draw your sword given what you’ve seen. In fact right now, all you’re feeling is fear.\n\n“Almost hit me…you would’ve made a good addition. Maybe you could’ve even…no. Nobody can. This world is lost now and soon my kind won’t even be around to guide your kind to combat the inevitable anymore…” Warnov says.\n“What…what are you talking about?” you ask unsure what’s going to happen next. Warnov looks as if he could tell you more than you’d ever want to know about lots of things, but instead he just shakes his head.\n\n“Nevermind human. Telling you the whole story would not help you anyway. Perhaps it’s best you hadn’t joined us, seeing as I have been marked now. It won’t be long before the rest of my kind are hunted down. He’s really quite pissed at us, and worse, he can sense us you see…(sigh) I can only imagine what he did to poor Count Rostov…”\n“Who’s pissed?”\n“Who do you think human? The Necro…I mean the Great Lich Lord of course. Oh yes. He’s back…and this one isn’t going to lose like the last one did so long ago.”\n\nYou’re not following all of Warnov’s cryptic speak, but if the last bit he’s said is true, he’s scared the hell out of you more than he has with his actions. Warnov grabs your shoulder and looks into your eyes.\n\n“I do not envy your fate human…the extinction of your species will soon follow my own. My advice to you? Live human! Live while you can, for eventually this whole world will be dead and under his complete control.”\n\nSensing that he’s brought enough doom and gloom to you, he relents and steps back.\n\n“Play me a song human.” He says catching you off guard.\n“…what did you want to hear?” you ask shakily.\n“I don’t know…anything. Play what you were playing before.”\n\nYou slowly pick up the dropped mandolin and begin playing the song that you were playing before and you play as if your life depended on it, though you get the impression that Warnov has no intention on killing you.\n\nHe sits quietly listening in the darkness, after finishing the song; he leaps back up through the hole.\n\n“Beautiful…such talent…such a waste…”\n\nA rope is thrown down and the sounds of feet running off are then heard. You wait a minute and then climb up the rope, taking the mandolin with you. You see private Ramusen lying nearby with his throat ripped out and thoroughly drained of blood.\n\nYou’re also just in time to hear other members of your group coming to your position when you exit the shop.\n\nWhat the hell are you supposed to tell them? Death to the world, reborn lich lords…you start thinking, what’s the point of all this? Maybe Warnov was right, maybe you should LIVE while there’s still time. Granted his information is spotty, but you can’t help but thinking he’s probably more informed on the situation than most people.\n\nYou’ve pondered it several times before, and you’ve even attempted it once, but deserting is looking very desirable again. In this day and age, who’s going to know if were killed or not?\n","page 55":"All of this is too much for you to handle. You know you’re dead, but you still feel afraid. You don’t know what to make of any of the shit Warnov just said and you don’t care, all you want to do is run away from all of this.\n\nYou take off running in a random direction with a confused stated of mind, not really knowing what is going to come next. You’re so overwhelmed by confusion and fear that you don’t even notice how much faster you’re actually moving.\n\nYou aren’t paying attention to too much of anything until you feel Warnov tackle you to the ground.\n\nWarnov quickly snaps your neck so you can’t move and looks a little mournful as he crouches near you.\n\n“I’m sorry human. I should’ve known better. Not everyone is meant for the gift. It is with great regret that I must now kill you. Such a loss…for both races.”\n\nWarnov pulls out a silver blade and jams it into your heart before cutting your head off and putting an end to your short undead life.\n","page 99":"Just because he’s acting reckless doesn’t mean you’re going to, you’re going to play upon your strengths and keep as far away as you can.\n\nYou ride your horse around the outskirts of the village, readying your bow the whole time. When you can, you fire at the Quillar attackers. As quick as they are, they aren’t really paying attention to you and you manage to get in some good shots. A couple of head shots even.\n\nAt first they don’t realize where the all the arrows are coming from, since Wessel is giving them a hard enough time with the chain lightning. You’re sort of glad you decided to stay on the outskirts. Wessel is having such a “good time” blasting the Quillars, he’s probably causing a lot more collateral damage in the process.\n\nEventually the Quillars start to retreat. This is when you get into a little more trouble as you happen to be right in the direction of where they’re running! They still look scary and they get even moreso as they get closer. The worst has to be their shrieks. It’s unpleasant to hear to say the least.\n\nYou ride out of the way, but your horse isn’t fast enough and is peppered by quills. You catch a few in the leg yourself and you’re thrown from the horse as it reels in pain, before collapsing.\n\nFeeling the pain you scramble for cover behind a nearby rock. Fortunately the quills don’t penetrate that. Most of them are content on just running away, but one straggler decides to try to get one more kill before leaving. That kill of course happens to be you.\n\nThe Quillar makes its high pitch shriek as it runs towards the rock. You don’t have time to ready your bow before its high jumped over the rock and on the other side of you. You quickly draw your weapon and swing it blindly as you turn around. Luckily your blade catches the side of its head, killing it. At last you collapse from the pain in your leg.\n\nWhile you’re pulling out quills, Wessel and another Zalan soldier come to meet you. Wessel doesn’t look any worse for wear, but the soldier looks very tired and obviously has wounds of his own.\n\n“There you are, lying down on the job I see.” Wessel mocks.\n“Are you alright?” the other soldier asks.\n“Yeah…Agh. I’ve gotten bitten in the leg by a Kobold before. Feels nearly the same except these quills go in a lot deeper.”\n“Glad you guys came when you did. We were just doing a routine patrol when these quill bastards came out of nowhere! They’re getting bolder and attacking in greater number, we need more reinforcements.”\n“Yeah, well good luck with that. The Tulan border is the primary concern. Besides I’m here now, I predict that this infestation will be over soon now.” Wessel boasts.\n\n“Any…way. My name’s Tylir. I’d introduce you to the rest of my squad, but they’re all dead now. Even though it was the heat of battle, I couldn’t help notice how well you picked off several of those Quillars with one shot. That was pretty impressive.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Hey! What about me? I’m the one who noticed you getting attacked in the first place! I’m also the one who saved your ass!” Wessel interrupts again, he’s starting to get annoying at this point, but Tylir doesn’t seem bothered by him.\n\n“Everyone did their part. Okay, since I’m here I’ll take you to see Captain Vhalat, I’m sure that’s who you were sent to report to, oh and wizard while your skills may be appreciated here, I’d advise you to cut down on the boasting. Captain Vhalat isn’t fond of it, and to be quite honest the other two wizards we had here were more experienced and they still got killed.”\n“Hmm, well perhaps they lacked the natural skill that I of course possess.”\n\nAt this point you and Tylir just roll your eyes and get moving.\n\nYou travel through a couple of other villages and it’s pretty depressing. You see stacks of bodies being buried in mass graves while most of other Retlad citizens look thoroughly defeated. A few look in your direction, but don’t look too much, it’s like they don’t really expect you to succeed. Not exactly inspiring.\n\nSoon you arrive in the town of Glaf. It would appear that the Zalan contingency sent here is staying in one of the bigger Retlad towns rather than the capitol. Ryan also says that the Quillar infestation is worse around here too, so the captain suspects that whatever lair they’re crawling out of is nearby and can hopefully located and cleansed.\n\nThe town itself resembles a small Zalan fort rather than a proper Retlad town, as a sturdy wall has been erected around it. The people seem to look a little more hopeful though. Tylir goes on to say that he thinks that the Retlad citizens are actually starting to prefer Zalan presence especially since their on government has been pretty ineffectual about the whole invasion. The Retlad army has only focused on defending the capitol. The Retlad royals appear to find their lives more important than anyone else’s.\n\nEventually you’re brought before Captain Vahlat himself. He looks up from the map he’s inspecting and addresses you and Wessel.\n\n“Ah, I see the Empire has seen fit to send me reinforcements…wow, twice as many as I thought I’d get. Private Tylir where’s the rest of your squad?”\n“Um…dead sir.”\n“Of course. (sigh) So what’s your problem private? Why is your leg wrapped up?” Vahlat asks you.\n“Got into a fight with the Quillars sir.” You answer.\n“Oh?”\n\nTylir at this point interrupts and tells of what happened. Wessel looks like he wants to expand upon his deeds, but Vahlat’s appearance is a little imposing and he was already warned once, so he keeps his mouth shut. Vahlat soon addresses you again.\n\n“Well it would seem you two have already proven yourselves useful. A lot more useful that what passes for the Retlad army, but of course that isn’t hard. Wizard, I certainly hope you don’t intend to use this place as a chance to show off all the skills you learned in your fancy Nuro college. One of your predecessors did that as well, and as you can see he’s no longer here. As for you, I hope that you can do a better job of keeping out of the way of the quills next time. Most don’t get a second chance. Alright that’s all for now. Our group is being housed for free at the Inn down the street. Free food as well, but don’t go overboard, its being rationed. You want more food or anything else you’ll have to pay like everyone else. I suggest though that you don’t do any heavy carousing. This is a high alert situation and we could be going to battle at anytime. Dismissed.”\n\nYou, Wessel and Tylir all leave at this point. Tylir goes on to show you where the Inn is and a couple of other places, but after today you just want to rest and retire to your room early. You rest your leg and begin practicing your lute. This puts you in better spirits.\n\n6 months pass…\n\nThe Quillar invasion has nearly been eradicated. Most of the major lairs have been located and cleansed and you certainly contributed greatly to this effort. Besides your combat abilities, your tracking skills definitely came in handy a lot.\n\nYou’ve become somewhat recognized among Retlad citizens due to your actions and the lives you’ve saved. The word “hero” has been used a few times though you definitely don’t think of yourself as one. In your free time you spoke with the citizens, a lot more than your fellow soldiers though. A few of them even convinced you to play for them when they noticed your lute. It took a little prodding, but eventually you gave in fully expecting to get booed, but to your surprise, you got applauded instead. Your playing didn’t just boost your spirits it seemed. Whenever you could you played a little bit for people in what little free time you had. Never did you think that you’d be playing for any kind of audience, let alone an appreciative one.\n\nIt definitely hasn’t been all sunshine though; you’ve seen a lot of people die. More than you ever wanted to actually. You’d made friends with Tylir shortly after your first meeting and he died only a couple months later. You’ll be glad when every one of these Quillar creatures are all dead though, all they’ve done is cause misery.\n\nYou’ve got them on the run now though. You’re preparing for an attack on another one of their lairs, when Captain Vahlat calls everyone to see him, he doesn’t look enthusiastic about whatever it is he has to tell you.\n\n“All right I’ll be brief. As much as I hate leaving a mission unfinished, we’re getting pulled out of here effective immediately. Major news is that Nuro has undergone a fucking disaster that needs to be put down like yesterday! All governments friendly to the City State of Nuro that can spare the manpower are to send help. We would be one of those. I hope the Retlad army is just competent enough to finish up what we started in their own country.”\n\nWessel immediately pipes up upon hearing about this revelation.\n\n“What happened in Nuro? What’s going on?!”\n“What’s going on? From what I’ve been told a whole bunch of your kind raised a shitload of undead and unleashed a bunch of hostile demons on the place! The entire city was overrun. Reports are already stating that small packs of demons are running around the nearby countryside. Most likely in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom. Not sure what that means with our border war with them, but I only see it getting bloodier around there. In any case, our job is to head to Nuro, before the undead start following suit. I hope you’re all ready for this, because this is going to be a lot different that fighting Quillars.”\n\nYou look around and see a lot of fear wash over faces and rightly so. Necromancers have a bad history on your world. When you were little you still remember hearing the tales of the Great Lich Lord that existed centuries before you were even born. He almost took over the world. Those stories gave you nightmares as a kid. The possibility of having to face something remotely similar even on much smaller scale doesn’t make you feel too well.\n","page 109":"You know that this is most likely a losing battle, but some hope might be gained, if you can somehow draw out the knights and specters and get them by themselves. As powerful as they are, they’re very hard to control even by necromancers and get easily agitated by living creatures.\n\nYou can’t do it alone though. You take your best archers and a couple of your best wizards and mention your plan. You don’t ask for volunteers, you just assign. You’re in charge and you have to make the hard decisions, even if it might mean you’ll die. They don’t look enthused, but you aren’t either.\n\nYou tell everyone else to hold their ground while you and your small platoon ride towards the horde.\n\n“Ready those blessed silvers men, and you robe wearers melt those dead tin cans!”\n\nYou get close enough and you unleash as many blessed silver arrows as you can at the Blood Specters. You kill a few. The wizards don’t do quite as well with the knights. However, both attacks are enough.\n\nYou see the Specters and Knights making whatever unearthly noises they do and begin to advance towards you far ahead of the slower yet steady moving horde. It apparent that the necromancer controlling them is attempting to bring them back under control, because they begin to squirm back and forth which gives you some more time to kill a few more during their confusion. Eventually the necromancer must give up total control because they stop squirming and advance upon you once again.\n\nYou ride back as quickly as possible with the Specters and Knights in full pursuit. You didn’t expect those Specters to be so fast. A few of them manage to catch up to some of your men with grisly results. You yourself almost get smacked upside the head by a Death Knight mace. When you get back in range the rest of your awaiting army deals with your pursuers. More blessed arrows fly into the Blood Specters before they can do anymore harm, and eventually the Death Knights are brought down as well.\n\nThere is no time for a reprieve though, as the main horde is now almost upon you. You order a regrouping as best you can, and face the enemy, telling if possible for someone to aim for the necromancer in all of this rotting mess.\n\nBones and limbs from both sides are broken and hacked off. A zombie skull is smashed, splashing maggots, blood and brains all over you and you’re not even thinking about it. You just have a tune in your head to take yourself away from the massacre. Somehow in all of the chaos, you single out the necromancer leading this army, he stands a far piece away from the main fighting, but he’s arrogant enough to be close enough for you to hit him with an arrow.\n\nAnd you have to hit him now. You see a Grand Alliance soldier who just took a fatal blow to the chest begin to rise…\n\nNot many arrows left and not much time, you just load up and shoot, hoping you hit the bastard.\n\nYour shot is straight and true. It strikes the necromancer in the stomach, causing him to fall back, which in turn causes the undead horde to momentarily stop their vicious attacks, giving your side a chance to turn the tide a bit.\n\nThen you shoot another arrow when you see the necromancer attempt to get back up, which turns the tide completely in your favor. Zombies and skeletons fall. Ghouls flee at the loss of leadership and any remaining undead are quickly dispatched. You don’t take chances though. You walk up to the corpse of the necromancer and shoot your last arrow directly into his head and stab him a few times.\n\nYou then start laughing.\n\n“If this was the Great Lich Lord, I’d be a real hero right now!”\n\nYou quickly sober up from this macabre outburst when you hear shouting from some of your men and you look up.\n\nIt’s another horde. Just as big. You look behind you and see that your own numbers are completely insufficient. The Garwold citizens are either mostly dead or demoralized at this point.\n\nEven when you win…you lose.\n\nHaving no real options, you sound a retreat to fall back to the Zalan border and suggest that the Garwold citizens do likewise as there is nothing more for them here.\n\nThe Garwold Confederacy is now just one more loss for the living. The Zalan Empire won’t be far behind.\n\nThree years pass…\n\nTen years since the Nuro incident and The Grand Alliance is nearly just consisting of the Zalan Empire now, which in turn has had to adapt a siege mentality. There is no “going on the offensive” anymore. You’re purely on defense.\n\nYour brother Mallack died two years ago. Transferred to a location with more fighting due to lack of manpower. Like it matters. Didn’t even get to say goodbye. You can only hope he didn’t become one of those things…but you know he probably did.\n\nYou’ve been urging your family to run where it’s safer, but of course they won’t budge. The undead have been penetrating deeper into Zalan territory, you know it’s only a matter of time before the Great Lich Lord decides to stop toying with you and makes his full scale attack.\n\nSure enough it happens. Town after town is taken; you’re pushed back further and further, and you know there’s nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nAn order is given to everyone to fallback to the capital and help defend it from an upcoming attack, but at this point you’re just wondering if the rest of your family is still alive.\n","page 10":"You’ve had enough. You’re not going to help OR stand by for another immoral act performed by your “co-workers”. It’s bad enough that it goes on, but that doesn’t mean you need to let it, if you can do something about it.\n\nYou run Dimitri through the back with your sword, he yells out in pain, but still manages to swing his armored fist to strike you in the face. You fall to the ground.\n\n“Fuck…lute boy…goin…down…pig fucker…” he wheezes as he attempts to step towards you only to fall to his knees. At this point Morri has recovered and cleaves Dimitri’s skull in with his axe.\n\n“Bastard.” Morri then looks at you. “Heh, I guess you must be one of the few with a conscious in the company eh?”\n“I guess so.” You reply.\n“Or perhaps you knew it would be better if I lived so you could find your way out this maze?”\n“…Actually I hadn’t even thought about that. I just…just couldn’t let him kill and rob you like that. Seen it too many times.”\n“That a fact? Well tell me son, why the hell are you hooked up with these bunch for then?”\n“Money to help the family…besides it’s not that bad.”\n“Okay, if you say so. However, this little incident is going to cost your company. We warned your captain that if any evidence of treachery occurred, we weren’t paying him shit and this deal was off!”\n“But can’t we just keep this secret? I mean…”\n“Secret? Fuck no! Look, you’re not a bad person, but you’re hanging out with bad people. The only reason why we hired you in the first place is because you ARE effective and you’re about the only mercenary company insane enough to do a job like this. But a deal’s a deal. You captain apparently doesn’t have control over his men like he thinks, because I’m sure he warned you all.”\n“Yeah, but everyone will probably blame me and my life will be in danger!”\n“…well…I’m sorry about that, but that’s the price you pay for the company you keep…look I’ll tell you what, because you helped me, I’ll take you back to the entrance and you can leave. Should at least give you a head start. Hell, maybe I’ll even tell them you died before this happened. You could then just hide out and stay out of sight without even anyone looking for you.”\n\nNot knowing what to say next you just agree and ponder your possible future.\n\nThe way back to the entrance is uneventful as far as demon attacks are concerned. You don’t know what you’re going to do. You’ll have to go on the run or at least relocate regardless of what Morri tells everyone. And if he mentions the truth, then your family may well be in danger. You imagine that if the Boss couldn’t get to you, he may very well take it out on your family.\n\nYou feel sick and upset. You wish you hadn’t chosen this path. All you ever really wanted to do was play your lute, not fight demons or anything else really.\n\nYou follow behind Morri in a daze. You’re surprised that he doesn’t insist that you walk in front of him, but then that’s probably because he trusts that you’re not a murderer. You also realize you recognize this part of the mine and could probably find your way back from here…\n\nYou shake your head and take a deep breath.\n\n“Hey Morri.”\n“Wha…glagh!\n\nAn arrow goes right through Morri’s mouth and out the other side of his head. He gurgles obscenities while trying to raise his axe towards you. Another arrow goes through his eye. He ceases his struggle.\n\nWhile you solved the problem of Morri telling anyone, now you have to cover your own tracks, then you hear a sound you never thought you’d be glad to hear. The chittering of those insect demons and a bunch of them are coming right behind you.\n\nYou pull the arrows out and run as quickly as you can to the entrance leaving the demons to feed upon Morri’s body. The thought crosses your mind to just leave anyway. Maybe they’d think all three of you got eaten. However, you run into another group during your dash to the mine entrance.\n\n“Where the hell are you running off to?” a mercenary asks. It’s Cal. You come up with a lie quick.\n\n“(pant) Shit! We got fucking ambushed! (pant) Barely fucking escaped! (pant) Dimitri and Morri are dead! Probably eaten! And the rest of those demon fuckers are heading this way!”\n“What?! You cowardly fucker, you just let Morri die?” one the dwarves says angrily.\n“It wasn’t my idea! I tried to help him and Dimitri, but they just came in force, I don’t even know how I escaped!”\n\nYour story is a little suspicious, but thanks to the demons, you’re covered. They didn’t leave much for the dwarves to find. However, you’re not looked favorably on by the rest of the dwarves for the rest of the mission. Your fellow mercenaries don’t really care one way or another. It’s part of the job and Dimitri wasn’t well liked so they could care less if he died or lived.\n\nYou on the other hand are still not feeling so great about yourself. The longer you’re part of this company the more you’re starting to think or be more like them. You hate it and you’ll be glad when this job is over.\n\nA few months pass and the contract is over. The “problem” isn’t completely gone, in fact there’s reports of some undead wandering in the area now, but the Dwarves are growing more weary of your presence, hand over your payment and tell you to leave. They say they can handle anything else themselves.\n\nIt’s quite a lot this time. Best job you’ve had. Upon your return to the Zalan Empire you buy yourself a new lute. It’s your “reward”. The rest of it goes to your family who of course are eager to hear about your tales as usual. You don’t tell them that many this time. You just try to take your mind off your “job” by asking them more questions this time around. When you’re alone you play your new lute, trying to emulate a couple of the songs you overheard the Dwarves engage in when you were there. You never knew they were musically inclined; it’s a shame you had to kill one to protect your future. You’re still debating on whether or not to give up the mercenary life, but you see how much it’s helping the family out, so you decide to stay and put up with it.\n\nAfter your “break is over” you go back to the job as usual.\n\nThree years pass…\n\nFour years have passed since the “Nuro Incident” and things have gotten much worse in the world. The Necromancer Lord conquered the Brot Kingdom, A demon lord called Velzix conquered the Tulan Kingdom, both are expanding and a so called Grand Alliance of nations doesn’t seem to be doing much good against either of them.\n\nThe Chimera Company was recently hired by the Zalan government. Due to your past battles with demons, they decided you would be good to put on Tulan Border which is still a bloodbath, but instead of fighting the Tulan Kingdom, the Zalan Empire is fighting Velzix’s hordes.\n\nIt’s not an easy assignment or very pleasant, in fact it’s got to be the worst job you’ve been on. You company is assigned to make commando raids and sabotage shit to keep the demons fairly unfocused, while the Zalan Empire’s real armies try to make progress into Velzix’s realm. Currently you’re making your “camp” in small abandoned village in enemy territory where you have to fight the occasional demon patrols.\n\nWhy the Captain took this job on for the company is beyond you. Nobody really knows why. The company in general has been taking more dangerous jobs in recent years. Ever since the Nuro Incident actually. While it’s always been known he’s not a man to shy away from danger and has a love of battle, there’s a lot of talk within ranks that he’s got a death wish.\n\nThe only “good thing” about this assignment, is that the chance for usual Chimera Company wicked acts are much lower. There’s not many “innocents” in a demon realm.\n\nAs you think about things, strumming your lute in an abandoned general store by yourself. You hear someone speak.\n\n“Pretty good playing. Wish my kind appreciated some of the more subtle things in life sometimes.”\n\nYou turn your head and see a demon! He’s not very tall and is “dressed up”. He must be one of the “civilized” demons who realigned themselves with their demonic natures and flocked to Velzix when he took over the Tulan Kingdom. He doesn’t seem hostile, but you drop your lute and draw your weapon, before you can yell a warning, he speaks again.\n\n“Wait! Before you go warning your friends, I should warn you that there is a very large group of my fellow kin surrounding this village. You kill me and they’ll attack and quite frankly I don’t fancy your chances. However I got a deal for you that can be worth your while. What can it hurt to listen to me? You can always kill me afterwards.”\n","page 54":"While this is all a lot to take in, you manage to calm down.\n\n“Okay. Okay. I’m calm, but…man this is a lot of shit.” You reply.\n“Heh, well you did say you might as well go with it! Don’t worry; it’ll all be second nature soon. Okay let’s go see Lord Rostov.”\n\nWarnov pulls out a black cube and teleports you to what seems to be the inside of a castle.\n\n“Alright, YOU stay right here in the foyer! Don’t go wandering around, I’m serious! You’re not quite in the fold yet, I have to go straighten this out and explain all this to Lord Rostov. I’ll be back to come get you later. Everything will be explained in full detail soon.”\n\nNot wishing to piss off anyone and being completely out of your element you stay put. The foyer has enough to keep you occupied though, you begin examining many of the paintings and statues to pass the time.\n\nSoon, Warnov returns with a very regal looking vampire. You can only assume that this is Lord Rostov.\n\n“Welcome, I’m sure you have ask many questions for me as I have for you, so we’ll just get right to it. We’ll walk and talk on the way to the throne room. Don’t worry about anyone listening. There are no secrets here.” Lord Rostov says.\n“Okay…I…”\n“BUT! Remember to address me as Lord Rostov if you are going to address me by name.” Lord Rostov adds with authority.\n\nYou take notice and obey, though Lord Rostov has such a commanding presence that you would be hard pressed not to obey him.\n\nYour questions are typical for someone brought into the fold. Rostov goes on about how his kind have been manipulating the mortal world for centuries just like Warnov said before. Several of the known governments have at least one vamp keeping an eye on things. Apparently many high ranking political types in your own Zalan Empire are vampires! The Grand Alliance is even a tool of the vampires.\n\nWhile Lord Rostov goes on about this fascinating history lesson, you look at some of his “court” as you walk through his castle. Some of them are more “mortal looking” than others. Some look down right hideous. You always thought vampires were supposed to be ultra attractive, but you can see that isn’t necessarily the case. When you get to his throne room Lord Rostov stops and turns to you.\n\n“So I hear you want to be a real hero eh? Well this is the place where they’re made.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Why do you think most heroes are always storming dungeons and doing impossible things? They don’t get those abilities without some help. The supernatural skill comes into play and dungeons aren’t exactly beacons of light!” Lord Rostov laughs.\n\n“Y…you mean ALL the heroes in the world are vampires?!”\n“Hah! I wish that was the case. No, there are many regular mortal heroes that do their part I suppose, but if you want the really legendary ones that have done impossible deeds, well chances are there was a vampire involved. Sadly we haven’t been too much more successful than the mortals in the heroics department lately.”\n“What’s been going on exactly?”\n“That little annoying necromancer lord, or whatever he thinks he is, has been proving to be a lot cleverer than what was previously believed. His armies have been growing in strength and I’m sure you know about the undead giant business and crushing the Brot Kingdom. What isn’t commonly known is how he accomplished it. He had help from one of our kind. A loathsome outcast known as the Ghoul King. (Sigh) Should’ve killed him long ago really, but…bah, it’s a long story. We’ll deal with him when the time comes. What’s more alarming is that we’ve sent assassins…or heroes to kill the necromancer lord and his bitch and he’s somehow managed to kill all of them. I mean I can somewhat understand them being killed by that brutish demon tyrant Velzix, but a fucking necromancer? He’s a fucking mortal! And from what we know of him, he wasn’t even that good of a wizard to begin with!”\n\nSuddenly Lord Rostov flies into a rage, yelling and punches a hole into the solid brick wall. Many of his court, as well as you and Warnov back away. He then stops and composes himself.\n\n“My apologies to you all. It’s been a trying time with upstart mortals and traitors and other annoyances. And to you, the newest member of our fold.”\n“Uh, no need to apologize to me Lord Rostov. It’s your home after all” You say which causes him to smile.\n“Carefully chosen words. Not overly sycophantic, yet still displaying the right subservient mindset. You should fit in very well here.”\n“But I meant it…”\n“Ha ha! And honest too! You’re more interesting than how Warnov described you. I have heard that you were one of those minor mortal heroes I was talking about earlier, but more interesting to me, is apparently you have talent in the musical field?”\n“So I’ve been told.”\n“Well, play something for me! All of us!”\n“What did you want to hear?”\n“Surprise me, if you’re able!”\n\nLord Rostov sits on his throne while his court whispers among themselves and then go quiet waiting for you to play. You pull out your lute and try to think of a song that they might like. You think of an old song that once was very popular among the aristocracy. Seems like a perfect crowd…\n\nYou begin to concentrate on the music and nothing but the music. You play as if your life was in danger, which you’re somewhat certain that it isn’t, but it doesn’t hurt to play your best right now.\n\nYour new supernatural reflexes certainly come in handy as you’re able to hit notes and play faster than you normally would’ve been able to as a mortal.\n\nWhen you’re finished you look around the room which is still silence until Lord Rostov gets off his throne and begins clapping. Everyone else follows suit.\n\n“That was magnificent! I heard the original bard who performed that piece three hundred years ago and even he couldn’t have done a better job! Warnov, this man is too valuable to make into a hero!”\n“Lord Rostov?”\n“While this man may have combat skills as you described, he is obviously a musician! Such talent such not be wasted in battle! Beautiful playing!”\n“While I agree he is a good musician Lord Rostov, I think we should consider the matter of the necromancer…”\n“(Sigh) Warnov, I was feeling good until you mentioned that mortal again! Nevertheless you are right. But still, this shall be HIS choosing. Not ours.”\n\nLord Rostov turns to you.\n\n“The decision shall be yours broodling. You may if you wish under go extensive training to prepare yourself for an encounter with that little necromancer lord. If you succeed, your name will be known, and you will become a legend. However, I can sense that such things are probably not your nature. Music is. I can see that you would be content to just play your music for an appreciative crowd. You could do that here. You could also learn songs that I have possession of, but sadly unable to play with the same spirit that you obviously have.”\n“What about my family? And my job and all that?”\n“Ah, your mortal life. I’m sure Warnov will already be taking steps to explain that you have been transferred from your current assignment. Considering he’s part of intelligence, nobody will ask too many questions, even if they bothered to. As for your family, they will be taken care of as you will still officially be part of the Zalan army. If you wish you may stay in contact with them through letters. Possibly arrangements can be made for you to visit them. During the night of course. But under NO circumstances will you tell them about any of this. Doing so would ruin my generous offer and be extremely bad for you. I don’t think we need to dwell on such depressing things because I know you’re smarter than that right?”\n“Yes Lord Rostov.”\n“Good, now what is it that you would like to do?”\n","page 98":"Just because he’s acting reckless doesn’t mean you’re going to, you’re going to play upon your strengths and keep as far away as you can.\n\nYou ride your horse around the outskirts of the village, readying your bow the whole time. When you can, you fire at the Quillar attackers. As quick as they are, they aren’t really paying attention to you and you manage to get in some good shots. A couple of head shots even.\n\nAt first they don’t realize where the all the arrows are coming from, since Wessel is giving them a hard enough time with the chain lightning. You’re sort of glad you decided to stay on the outskirts. Wessel is having such a “good time” blasting the Quillars, he’s probably causing a lot more collateral damage in the process.\n\nEventually the Quillars start to retreat. This is when you get into a little more trouble as you happen to be right in the direction of where they’re running! They still look scary and they get even moreso as they get closer. The worst has to be their shrieks. It’s unpleasant to hear to say the least.\n\nYou ride out of the way, but your horse isn’t fast enough and is peppered by quills. You catch a few in the leg yourself and you’re thrown from the horse as it reels in pain, before collapsing.\n\nFeeling the pain you scramble for cover behind a nearby rock. Fortunately the quills don’t penetrate that. Most of them are content on just running away, but one straggler decides to try to get one more kill before leaving. That kill of course happens to be you.\n\nThe Quillar makes its high pitch shriek as it runs towards the rock. You don’t have time to ready your bow before its high jumped over the rock and on the other side of you. You quickly draw your weapon and swing it blindly as you turn around. Luckily your blade catches the side of its head, killing it. At last you collapse from the pain in your leg.\n\nWhile you’re pulling out quills, Wessel and another Zalan soldier come to meet you. Wessel doesn’t look any worse for wear, but the soldier looks very tired and obviously has wounds of his own.\n\n“There you are, lying down on the job I see.” Wessel mocks.\n“Are you alright?” the other soldier asks.\n“Yeah…Agh. I’ve gotten bitten in the leg by a Kobold before. Feels nearly the same except these quills go in a lot deeper.”\n“Glad you guys came when you did. We were just doing a routine patrol when these quill bastards came out of nowhere! They’re getting bolder and attacking in greater number, we need more reinforcements.”\n“Yeah, well good luck with that. The Tulan border is the primary concern. Besides I’m here now, I predict that this infestation will be over soon now.” Wessel boasts.\n\n“Any…way. My name’s Tylir. I’d introduce you to the rest of my squad, but they’re all dead now. Even though it was the heat of battle, I couldn’t help notice how well you picked off several of those Quillars with one shot. That was pretty impressive.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Hey! What about me? I’m the one who noticed you getting attacked in the first place! I’m also the one who saved your ass!” Wessel interrupts again, he’s starting to get annoying at this point, but Tylir doesn’t seem bothered by him.\n\n“Everyone did their part. Okay, since I’m here I’ll take you to see Captain Vhalat, I’m sure that’s who you were sent to report to, oh and wizard while your skills may be appreciated here, I’d advise you to cut down on the boasting. Captain Vhalat isn’t fond of it, and to be quite honest the other two wizards we had here were more experienced and they still got killed.”\n“Hmm, well perhaps they lacked the natural skill that I of course possess.”\n\nAt this point you and Tylir just roll your eyes and get moving.\n\nYou travel through a couple of other villages and it’s pretty depressing. You see stacks of bodies being buried in mass graves while most of other Retlad citizens look thoroughly defeated. A few look in your direction, but don’t look too much, it’s like they don’t really expect you to succeed. Not exactly inspiring.\n\nSoon you arrive in the town of Glaf. It would appear that the Zalan contingency sent here is staying in one of the bigger Retlad towns rather than the capitol. Ryan also says that the Quillar infestation is worse around here too, so the captain suspects that whatever lair they’re crawling out of is nearby and can hopefully located and cleansed.\n\nThe town itself resembles a small Zalan fort rather than a proper Retlad town, as a sturdy wall has been erected around it. The people seem to look a little more hopeful though. Tylir goes on to say that he thinks that the Retlad citizens are actually starting to prefer Zalan presence especially since their on government has been pretty ineffectual about the whole invasion. The Retlad army has only focused on defending the capitol. The Retlad royals appear to find their lives more important than anyone else’s.\n\nEventually you’re brought before Captain Vahlat himself. He looks up from the map he’s inspecting and addresses you and Wessel.\n\n“Ah, I see the Empire has seen fit to send me reinforcements…wow, twice as many as I thought I’d get. Private Tylir where’s the rest of your squad?”\n“Um…dead sir.”\n“Of course. (sigh) So what’s your problem private? Why is your leg wrapped up?” Vahlat asks you.\n“Got into a fight with the Quillars sir.” You answer.\n“Oh?”\n\nTylir at this point interrupts and tells of what happened. Wessel looks like he wants to expand upon his deeds, but Vahlat’s appearance is a little imposing and he was already warned once, so he keeps his mouth shut. Vahlat soon addresses you again.\n\n“Well it would seem you two have already proven yourselves useful. A lot more useful that what passes for the Retlad army, but of course that isn’t hard. Wizard, I certainly hope you don’t intend to use this place as a chance to show off all the skills you learned in your fancy Nuro college. One of your predecessors did that as well, and as you can see he’s no longer here. As for you, I hope that you can do a better job of keeping out of the way of the quills next time. Most don’t get a second chance. Alright that’s all for now. Our group is being housed for free at the Inn down the street. Free food as well, but don’t go overboard, its being rationed. You want more food or anything else you’ll have to pay like everyone else. I suggest though that you don’t do any heavy carousing. This is a high alert situation and we could be going to battle at anytime. Dismissed.”\n\nYou, Wessel and Tylir all leave at this point. Tylir goes on to show you where the Inn is and a couple of other places, but after today you just want to rest and retire to your room early. You rest your leg and begin practicing your lute. This puts you in better spirits.\n\n6 months pass…\n\nThe Quillar invasion has nearly been eradicated. Most of the major lairs have been located and cleansed and you certainly contributed greatly to this effort. Besides your combat abilities, your tracking skills definitely came in handy a lot.\n\nYou’ve become somewhat recognized among Retlad citizens due to your actions and the lives you’ve saved. The word “hero” has been used a few times though you definitely don’t think of yourself as one. In your free time you spoke with the citizens, a lot more than your fellow soldiers though. A few of them even convinced you to play for them when they noticed your lute. It took a little prodding, but eventually you gave in fully expecting to get booed, but to your surprise, you got applauded instead. Your playing didn’t just boost your spirits it seemed. Whenever you could you played a little bit for people in what little free time you had. Never did you think that you’d be playing for any kind of audience, let alone an appreciative one.\n\nIt definitely hasn’t been all sunshine though; you’ve seen a lot of people die. More than you ever wanted to actually. You’d made friends with Tylir shortly after your first meeting and he died only a couple months later. You’ll be glad when every one of these Quillar creatures are all dead though, all they’ve done is cause misery.\n\nYou’ve got them on the run now though. You’re preparing for an attack on another one of their lairs, when Captain Vahlat calls everyone to see him, he doesn’t look enthusiastic about whatever it is he has to tell you.\n\n“All right I’ll be brief. As much as I hate leaving a mission unfinished, we’re getting pulled out of here effective immediately. Major news is that Nuro has undergone a fucking disaster that needs to be put down like yesterday! All governments friendly to the City State of Nuro that can spare the manpower are to send help. We would be one of those. I hope the Retlad army is just competent enough to finish up what we started in their own country.”\n\nWessel immediately pipes up upon hearing about this revelation.\n\n“What happened in Nuro? What’s going on?!”\n“What’s going on? From what I’ve been told a whole bunch of your kind raised a shitload of undead and unleashed a bunch of hostile demons on the place! The entire city was overrun. Reports are already stating that small packs of demons are running around the nearby countryside. Most likely in the direction of the Tulan Kingdom. Not sure what that means with our border war with them, but I only see it getting bloodier around there. In any case, our job is to head to Nuro, before the undead start following suit. I hope you’re all ready for this, because this is going to be a lot different that fighting Quillars.”\n\nYou look around and see a lot of fear wash over faces and rightly so. Necromancers have a bad history on your world. When you were little you still remember hearing the tales of the Great Lich Lord that existed centuries before you were even born. He almost took over the world. Those stories gave you nightmares as a kid. The possibility of having to face something remotely similar even on much smaller scale doesn’t make you feel too well.\n","page 108":"You can’t take it anymore.\n\n“I’M NOT A FUCKING HERO! OKAY!? I NEVER WAS AND I NEVER WANTED TO BE! (sob)… I just wanted to go home…(sob)”\n\nYou weep for a few minutes before the captain speaks again.\n\n“Alright then what happened? Tell me the entire truth and maybe you’ll avoid the executioner’s axe.”\n\nAt this point you have little choice. You’re too distraught to say anything else. You give a relatively condensed version of what happened. At Nuro and what happened recently. Your encounter with Warnov seems to surprise her quite a bit. You also go on to explain that it was high ranking Zalan officers that insisted on this hero nonsense. She believes you, like she knows something of it.\n\n“(sigh) Yeah there’s a statue of my dad in the Zalan capitol…but I know better…”\n\nYou don’t question anymore about this quiet outburst from her since you’re still too worried about what’s going to happen to you.\n\n“So why did you come back? You probably could’ve gotten away with it.”\n“The same reason why I joined. My family. I guess I just needed a reminder of that first hand. And if there’s any hope of changing the tide of this war with the undead then I need to stand by my decision of joining the Zalan Army and making the world safer for them.”\n\nOnce again the captain seems to soften. She almost looks like she’s going to tear up as well, but she turns away.\n\n“My family…I…” are all she says before taking a deep breath and turning back towards you, with a serious mindset again.\n\n“Alright, I shall trust your word for now sergeant, but I will be watching you VERY carefully! Consider yourself lucky for evading death once again, perhaps you do have knack for avoiding it. Let us hope that luck rubs off on the rest of us in the upcoming battle. I’m putting you in charge of the Retlad archery platoon. They’ll probably like you. Dismissed.”\n\nBefore you leave she says one last thing.\n\n“And sergeant, don’t listen to what that bizarre vampire said. We’re not going to become extinct. We’re going to win and survive a long time. Besides you still have to play that song for me.”\n\nAs you leave you feel a sigh of relief that you won’t be dying just yet, but given that you’re heading into battle soon with the undead, you’re wondering if you just didn’t postpone the inevitable.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nSeven years since the Nuro Incident changed the world into this living hell.\n\nYour time served in the Grand Alliance has not really changed much. The Grand Alliance and the Zalan Empire are basically one of the same now thanks to the complete embrace of a totalitarian system. Might makes right. Nations like the Azi Republic protested, but there was little that they could, after all Zalan has been practically defending the world by itself for the past few years. You get the impression that if this war is won; the Zalan Empire is going to throw its hat in to be a one world government.\n\nAmazing how power and conspiracy is plotted even when it probably won’t happen. “Probably won’t” because your superiors and political leaders are a lot more “optimistic” about winning than you are, but then they haven’t had to face the horrors you’ve faced.\n\nAnd horrors are a completely accurate word. You’ve gotten over your fear of the undead, but it doesn’t make it any easier. You’re starting to lose ground. Everyday the living lose someone, the Great Lich Lord gains. It’s a question of numbers and quite frankly your side doesn’t have them.\n\nYou sort of wish your old captain was here. She was a very good leader and inspirational, but then again that’s why she was made a general and sent elsewhere. She asked you to play that song before she left though. Somehow it seemed to make her sadder afterwards.\n\n“Captain, undead are on the move, they won’t be long now.” One of your messengers says.\n“Yes, I can sense it. Here. You head back to my home. You know where it is by now, and give this message to my family. If you get back here and see undead, well get the fuck out and run back to Zalan territory.”\n\nBeing a captain hasn’t really turned you into a copy of the captains you served in the past, but then again you didn’t even think you’d ever be promoted to one. Your reign as one has been a little unorthodox as you’ve applied more guerilla tactics than traditional ones, but given your assignment and your background it makes a hell of a lot more sense.\n\nYou’re currently stationed on what remains of the Garwold Confederacy. It was a relatively peaceful nation made up mostly of Halflings and Gnomes, with lush green fields and flowers. Now it’s just slowly becoming another massive graveyard and example of genocide.\n\nYou’ve gotten to know quite a few of them and you’re always amazed of how they can keep their sense of humor in the face of utter destruction. One of them actually gives you an answer.\n\n“To keep from crying.”\n\nIndeed. You’ve been playing quite a bit when you’re not battling the undead. (The Garwold citizens enjoy your playing a lot) It’s gotten to the point where you don’t just play anymore to keep your mind off of things, it’s like it transports you to a different world. A better world.\n\nIf only.\n\nYou often wonder how your brother Mallack is doing. He’s been stationed in a relatively safer location back in Zalan territory. You’re guessing that it lowers the odds of having your mom lose both of her sons at the same time. Like it makes it any better if she lost them within any length on time of each other. You wonder if the war is going to go on long enough that by the time Calwin grows up he’ll be drafted as well.\n\nIf he even gets the chance to grow up.\n\nYou can’t think about it now. A massive undead horde is coming and there’s no where left to hide. There will be open battle and you need to stay focused.\n\nYou go through the whole order thing, and making sure your strategy is sound. You wish you had more wizards, but they seem to be in shorter supply these days. It’s almost like they’re being targeted deliberately sometimes…actually you don’t think it, you KNOW that they are.\n\nYou see the undead horde approach. You look through some new fangled dwarven invention called an eye piece and see something makes your job a hell of a lot worse.\n\nYou don’t just see the usual undead. You see fully armored Death Knights. Harder to kill than even a zombie giant. You see Blood Specters. Dark crimson spirits that can cause their victims to bleed from every orifice with their shrieks. Both of those are at the head of this horde, and this isn’t even counting that you’re severely outnumbered by just the regular zombies, skeletons, ghosts and the like.\n","page 13":"You don’t waste time, you just attack! Unfortunately the demon is more than he appears and easily dodges your attack. You don’t have time to turn and react again when he’s tripped you up and put his fist in your face causing your nose to explode into a mass of blood. You’re dazed.\n\n“(Sigh) And here I thought you were the reasonable one of this bunch. Nevermind.” The demon says.\n\nHe follows up with another fist to your face. This one goes through your head killing you instantly.\n","page 57":"While the offer of playing for what could possibly be eternity is tempting, part of you has been affected by world events and the war going on. You have come to realize that the Necromancer (and the demons) need to be stopped. If you can take an active role in that, then you’ll know for sure that your family will be safe in the near future. You did do all this for your family after all, and while your path has definitely undergone a change, you’re still going to put them first.\n\nBesides, you’re a vampire now, you’re sure that you’ll have tons of time to play later if all goes well. You’re definitely nervous about this decision, but you’re going to make it.\n\n“Lord Rostov, I wish to begin your advanced combat training.” You say.\n“Very well, though I almost hoped that you wouldn’t. Your playing was just divine and you won’t be able to play again for a long time during your extensive training time. Possibly never if you fail…but let us hope that you do not fail! It would be a loss for all of us. Warnov escourt him to the lower dungeons.”\n“Yes, Lord Rostov.”\n\nWarnov takes you into the lower dungeons of the castle just as Lord Rostov commanded. Warnov tells you that this isn’t going to be easy and that you better condition your mind to almost a pure instinctive level because you could very well die in training!\n\nFinally you reach a large barren room with a pair of large doors on the far end.\n\n“This is it. Just keep an eye on the large door over there and well, brace yourself!”\n\nYou half expect to get bitten again after hearing those words, but instead Warnov quickly steps out of the room and locks the door leaving you alone. The large doors on the other side of the room start to open.\n\nAnd you just realized that you don’t have a weapon…\n\nA year passes…\n\nYou survive your rigorous training. You have fought all manner of dangerous beasts with and without weapons. (And feasting on their blood for survival) You have undergone pain you didn’t think possible even in your new undead state. You’re definitely a better killing machine than you were.\n\nYou were allowed to write letters to your family which were overlooked first by Lord Rostov of course to make sure you weren’t saying something you shouldn’t. You barely know what to tell them except keeping your lies to a minimum about your supposed new job with Zalan intelligence. You have dedicated and conditioned yourself to combat so much that you don’t even think about music. You briefly wonder if you’ve “lost” something, but you then dismiss such things as you must focus on battle.\n\nDuring this time you have been informed that the Necromancer Lord as well as Velzix have grown in power. Lord Rostov says though that he believes the demons will pose no serious threat if a concentrated effort can be made on them by the mortals. However, for that to happen, the Necromancer Lord must die and that’s where you come in and what you’ve been training for.\n\nHowever, you won’t be going in by yourself. A band of “heroes” will be necessary for a job like this. You are told you will meet the others in a small abandoned village bordering on the Necromancer’s Domain.\n\nAnother vampire takes you there with the aid of a black teleportation cube. This is a one way trip. You’re not coming back unless you win. That and the fact that the black cubes can’t possibly be allowed to fall into enemy hands.\n\nThere you meet the others. They look unimpressed with you, but you’re a little surprised to see one of them. She’s very well known…a “hero”.\n\n“You’re Deliah the Deathdealer! You fought at the battle of Azark and you also retrieved the Celestial Sword! You’re a hero! I didn’t know you were…”\n“Didn’t they tell you all this shit when you started training? Sheesh, we gotta get paired up with some broodling…” a brutish vampire interrupts.\n“Quiet Gorax! I’m sure he was, but meeting a legend is a lot different from basking in their glory in person.” Deliah replies.\n“Gorax!? Gorax the Mighty? You were a barbarian king that held back the orc hordes over a hundred years ago!” you say in amazement.\n“Huh, fat lot good that did me. I can’t take any credit for of my deeds today and barely anyone remembers my past deeds except some useless tribal shamen that now cower from the undead hordes in the Drozz Plains. Feh! Back in my day such men would not allow mere ghouls run them off their lands! I don’t know why Rostov won’t allow me to go in, seek out, and just chop off that retched Ghoul King’s head! He’s partially to blame for this mess!”\n“Oh you know Rostov, he has his reasons. Besides, if we take out the Necromancer lord, the Ghoul King will probably be our next assignment.” Another vampire says in a bored tone. This one looks like he was once a Halfling. It almost makes you laugh to think of a vampire Halfling, but there he is. You don’t know who he is or was, but given the other two, he was probably important at one time.\n\n“So are you ready to go broodling? Or are you going to stand there with a dumb look on your face?” Delilah asks.\n“Uh sure, let’s go!”\n\nThe trip into the Necromancer’s Domain is surprisingly quick and uneventful. You attempt to make conversation as you can’t help now but be curious about your companions, but all of them are less than talkative and forthcoming. Deliah eventually takes you aside harshly.\n\n“Look broodling, we’ve got a job to do. A fucking dangerous one at that! We all need to be in focus and not concentrating on anything else! So keep your damn questions to yourself and if you happen to survive this encounter THEN perhaps you may get a little more information from us and our fascinating history. Until then, stay in the fucking dark!”\n\nThe rest of the trip is silent.\n\nAt last you reach the city of Nuro and easily scale its walls and onto the battlements while remaining undetected the whole time. This is a lot different from what it was when you arrived here as a mortal. That memory still gives you a bit of pause. You remember how scared you were back then.\n\n“Hurry up broodling! These walking corpses might not be able to detect us, but the Necromancer will soon! We need to get the advantage as soon as possible! Gorax, Wally you go through the front of the main tower. I’m sure you two can handle that. While whatever guards rush to defend their master, me and the broodling will scale the tower and go in through one of the top windows.\n\n“You sure about that Delilah? Would you rather I go with you than some broodling?” Wally asks.\n“Yeah, but if I leave him with Gorax he’ll probably get killed in the fighting and be useless. At least if he’s with me, he can serve as an extra body for the Necromancer Lord to draw his attention to.”\n“HEY! I’m right here y’know!” you exclaim indignantly which causes Deliah to smack you in the face hard. You didn’t even see it coming.\n“Shut the fuck up! You’ll draw attention! Look if we pull this off just maybe you’ll come out of this alive. I need you to take care of the Necromancer’s bitch anyway. She’s probably up there with him. Now let’s do this!”\n\nThe plan is set into action. Gorax and Wally make their presence known immediately jumping off the battlements and into the courtyard while yelling at the top of their lungs.\n\n“Intruder! Protect the master!” you hear a scratchy voice yell in the distance, while you and Delilah sneak around, jumping onto the rooftops and attempting to avoid the main fighting force. A few flying shadows try to stop you, but they’re easily dispatched with your bow and silver arrows. Delilah looks glad that you aren’t entirely useless and you and her proceed to scale the walls.\n\n“I can’t believe this place isn’t more protected.” You say while climbing.\n“Heh, he’s got his troops all spread out and mostly on his borders, plus he’s grown more arrogant and confident. That will be his undoing.” She replies quickly.\n\n“Funny I was about to say the same for you bloodsuckers.” A voice says causing the both of you to look up.\n\nA raven haired female leans over the nearby window above Delilah and blast her directly in the face burning it off with a beam of light. You certainly weren’t expecting a necromancer to cast any sort of spell like that! You then see Delilah fall…and get impaled through the chest by a weathervane. A fucking weathervane. Unbelievable.\n\nYou attempt to scale the wall to the nearest window under you and just barely get out of the way of the lady necromancer’s next spell.\n\nYou have no idea where you are in the tower, but you can hear fighting going on outside and a couple of hearty roars which you can only guess is Gorax.\n\nA quick scan would indicate that you’re in some sort of library. You cautiously proceed and decide that finding stairs that lead up would be the way to go. You just hope you’re ready to take him on and his mistress.\n\nAs you make your way through, you fight all manner of undead sentries: Wraiths, ghosts, skeletal warriors, etc. During one of your moments of hiding a couple of wight guards run by talking in a hoarse tone.\n\n“The big one and little one are dead! We must find the last one! Quick Quick!”\n“Yes Yes! The master must be protected!”\n\nYou come to the very real feeling of having been in the position before…all alone, surrounded by hostile undead, and in Nuro…\n\nYour resolve breaks a little and you wish that you weren’t here. You want to go home.\n\nEventually you push yourself forward, but somehow fear has crept back into your own dead heart. To your credit you do reach the top of the tower, but the Necromancer’s mistress once again surprises you. A ray of light sears your face off and destroys your vision. You fall to the cold stone floor in extreme pain and can only make out blurry images.\n\nYou see a blurred black hooded figure approach. You can’t see his face, but this could only be who you think it is. You attempt to reach for your sword.\n\n“More assassins? I swear something is going to have to be done about these bloodsuckers. The Ghoul King’s kin are really starting to get on my nerves. These ones weren’t even a challenge. What are you doing bloodsucker? Don’t you know that’s futile?”\n\nThe Necromancer Lord unleashes a ball of flame that engulfs your body, putting an end to your undead existence.\n","page 12":"You aren’t sure about this, but you let him speak.\n\n“Speak demon, but make it quick!” you demand.\n“Ah, glad you’re willing to be reasonable. Name’s Big Red by the way.”\n“Get on with it!”\n“Very well. Your company and everyone in it is doomed to the infernal planes when they die I’m afraid. You captain’s deeds alone make him one of the most sought after souls in Hell. He used to be much worse before he got married, but ah well; women often make men weak like that.”\n“Yeah? Well not me.”\n“Heh, yeah you too. I understand that you’re probably the most moral person in it, but this whole company has been targeted by Hell and Hell gets what it wants.”\n“Well Velzix isn’t…”\n“Velzix? I’m not talking about Velzix! Velzix is just another demon with big dick complex. If I trust my judgment he’s not going to last another year in his current status, he’ll probably either be dead by one of you mortals or that little Necromancer. (Sigh) Wish I’d known about him sooner, things could’ve been a lot…different.”\n\nBig Red sees that you’re getting antsy so he gets to the point again.\n\n“Anyway, seeing as you’re all doomed to Hell, I figured it would be nice if I got direct credit for bringing you there. Bringing in evil souls yourself is one of the few things makes Hell all worth it. You get all sorts of perks. However, if I just call in the reinforcements now to have you guys get ripped from limb to limb, I won’t get direct credit. The souls will just be gathered wily nily and then I gotta argue with the fucking collectors and lawyers and all that other shit about who killed who and who gets credit which will probably just result in nobody getting credit and doesn’t help me out at all.”\n“Barring that you’re saying that I’m doomed in any case, I fail to see why I should help you.”\n“Well that’s why I’m coming to you with a deal. I can see you’re not a bad person, you just serve a bad master, and he’s the one I really want direct credit for. The rest of you are just a bonus and you in particular aren’t even worth that much given your tendency towards good.”\n“So what is it you want from me exactly?”\n“I want you to take out the sentries and distract your fellows for as long as possible while my boys sneak up on this village and strike with as little resistance as possible. To sweeten this deal, I’ll try to tell my boys to not target you while you try to escape the mayhem. I’m not making any promises though, killing rampages among my kind encourage indiscriminate killing. You’ll be on your own; however it gives you a small chance for survival and by agreeing to this plan it gives me direct credit as the mastermind of this cunning plan. Getting other demons to kill isn’t any kind of feat, but employing a mortal to help is looked upon as more favorable. So do we have a deal?”\n\nBig Red offers his hand…\n","page 15":"It sounds like your only chance for survival, slim though it may be. In some ways you’d like to be out of this company and who are you really betraying? From what you’ve seen the company is little better than the demons. You’re sick of all of this, the fighting, the demons, the company, all of it.\n\n“It’s a deal, but make a damn good effort for your kin NOT to target me, AND not to go chasing me either!”\n“Okay! Sheesh, you’re mistrustful. You just make sure you do your part.” Big Red says and shakes your hand.\n\nYou both exit the abandoned store and you look for where most of your fellows are located. The village square of course. You know there are look outs in each of “corners” of the village. You sneak about the village like an assassin and ready your bow.\n\nYou take out each sentry in relative silence with your skillful bow shots and drag their bodies into a nearby house. Now nobody will raise an alarm too soon. You then head to the village square and begin interacting with some of them. They find it odd since you’re usually keeping to yourself, but they enjoy your playing so they don’t mind it when you do that.\n\nYour Captain on the other hand comes out from the house he’s set up in and is wondering what all the commotion is. He gets angry.\n\n“What the fuck are you idiots doing? We’re fucking deep in demon territory and you’re all making enough noise to attract a damn army of them.”\n“What difference does it make? They got patrols that have come across our location before, so they know where we’re at.” You remark.”\n“The difference is that I want you fuckers to be alert and focused if we get attacked, not getting drunk and dancing to music like some fucking sissy elf!”\n“Aren’t you married to an elf?” you say still playing and backing away from the Captain’s reach. He’s almost in shock that you’d speak to him in such manner especially since you never usually speak too much in the first place.\n\n“You, pig farmer are really pushing my patience tonight. If I didn’t need all the people I can get for this job, I’d kill you myself!”\n“Shhh! I think you better shut the fuck up lute boy.” One of the other mercenaries whispers.\n“Why? We’re already in fucking Hell, who gives a shit how much noise we make?”\n\nYou defiance gets worse and finally the Captain draws his weapon to shut you up. At this point you call him a pile of orc shit and run. This causes the rest of the mercenaries to get out his way as he charges at you. Some of them also give chase, but most just stay out of it.\n\nFortunately at this point the demons have finally gotten into position and strike. Most of the company is so bewildered by what has occurred between you and the Captain that they’re unprepared. Your Captain immediately stops his pursuit of you when a particularly large demon jumps on top of him from one of the rooftops. He fights it off with the help of some of his men, but you see more coming and continue to make your escape.\n\nAs you run away from the village, a few demons pass you by and don’t attack, looks like Big Red kept his word.\n\nTo a point.\n\nBig Red suddenly appears in front of you.\n\n“Thanks friend, now for your reward!” he says and then puts his fist through your chest which kills you instantly.\n\nYou don’t know how much time has passed, but you eventually hear Big Red speaking to you.\n\n“Get up, I need your word.”\n“Huh?” you say in a daze.\n“Did I not get you to distract the Chimera Company in an effort to collect all their souls?”\n“Huh? Yeah…” you continue to say in a daze.\n\nYou start shaking the cobwebs and see that you’re in a completely different place. A very bad place. Big Red and another much bigger demon are talking. You see the rest of your Company in the distance, naked and in chains. The entire landscape is very barren, has a reddish hue and its uncomfortably hot.\n\n“Okay, you’ll get credit for all these souls.”\n“Hang on, I want to keep this one, he has certain talents and he did allow all this to happen.” Big Red says pointing to you.\n“Very well…that’s your right. Just sign there, and there, okay. Let’s load these sorry souls up!”\n\nBig Red looks pleased with himself as the souls are taken away.\n\n“Come on, I’m going to take a break.”\n\nYou feel compelled to join him, but you still have questions obviously.\n\n“What the fuck man?! I’m in Hell!”\n“Got it in one. Excellent detective work.”\n“But…But the deal! You broke the fucking deal! I don’t belong here!”\n“No I didn’t. I said my fellows wouldn’t harm you, not that I wouldn’t. Besides YOU made a deal with me, which damned you in the first place. You definitely belong here.”\n\nThe reality of this situation has now caused a massive amount of fear within you. You’re in Hell and there’s no escape from it! You can’t even attack Big Red, he’s got a permanent magical hold on you from causing him any sort of harm, though you probably wouldn’t be a match for him anyway. You collapse on the ground and feel defeated. Big Red stops, but he doesn’t get angry.\n\n“Now what is your problem? I just saved YOUR soul from being eternally tormented by my superiors. They’ll probably be eating them and shitting them out only to eat them again for who knows how long. Not a pleasant process.”\n“But…but what are you going to do to me?” you ask.\n“You? You’re going to play for me at my home in the Blood Hills. Trust me, its not nearly as bloody as the name makes out.”\n“Play?”\n“Sure. I said you played pretty well, and I do appreciate such things. Music is one of my hobbies other than the whole soul collection thing of course. I’ve got sheets of music from lots of places; I can’t play worth a shit though. The claws don’t help either. Now come on let’s go.”\n\nYou are finding this very odd, but you don’t feel as bad now. You’re Big Red’s slave, but given where you’re at, things could be a lot worse. You’ll at least get to do something you’ve always wanted to do. Play music without hindrance. You wonder about your family, but there’s little that you can do for them now. You just hope things work out for them in the living world.\n\nBig Red’s home isn’t some giant castle, but a moderate sized house. The inside is decorated with grisly trophies, which you guess can only be considered demonic art.\n\n“Sinthinia! I know you’re here! I can smell your scent!” he calls out.\n\nA sexy female demon comes out of one of the rooms. You can’t help but stare, she barely acknowledges you at all though.\n\n“I’ve been waiting for you Big Red, so did the deal go down well?”\n“Well, it could’ve gone better, but it was still a good haul. So how is it really going with Velzix?”\n“(Sigh) He’s probably going to lose as predicted. I can sense it, anyone with half a brain can. That whole world is going to eventually become a graveyard, I know it. And the undead are no fun. That’s why I’ve come back here.”\n“Well my house is your house. Let’s put some music on shall we?” Big Red points to you. “You, go pick up that mandolin over there and start playing that something on those music sheets I got set up. Sit over there and continue playing until I say stop which won’t be anytime soon.”\n\nOnce again you feel the need to comply. You do exactly as Big Red commands as he and Sinthinia head to a bedroom. He then stops to turn to you.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know if you realized it at the soul market, but your Captain was NOT there. You know why? Because he somehow managed to fucking escape death! Now I could blame the idiots that were working for me for allowing him to escape, but I figured since I got you anyway, it would be more fun to blame you. Enjoy playing music for all eternity!” he says as Sinthinia giggles and they close the door.\n\nYou don’t quite understand that remark until you begin playing the mandolin. You begin to feel excruciating pain all over. Your mind is tormented with negative emotions causing you great distress as well.\n\nBig Red has made it so your greatest love which is music causes you pain.\n\nAnd you can never stop playing.\n\nAll you can do is suffer.\n","page 9":"You hate yourself for this, but you feel you don’t have much choice, if Morri lives he’ll certainly tell everyone and then you won’t get paid which will probably result in your death by the hands of the Boss. You raise your own weapon and help kill Morri. He doesn’t die easy, but Dimitri finishes him off before he can put up any sort of meaningful defense.\n\nBreathing hard and smiling at you with blood on his face, Dimitri laughs a bit.\n\n“Heh heh, knew you’d see the light, lute boy! Now come on, let’s throw his body in that left passage. I think I heard some of those demon roaches chittering down that way. Let’s just make sure we’re not around eh? We got a lot of silver to load up on!”\n\nYou don’t take any of the silver actually, you’re still worrying and not feeling right about this whole situation, of course that just means more for Dimitri.\n\nYou don’t even think this half assed plan of Dimitri’s is going to work. You and Dimitri are going to look mighty suspicious meeting up with the other dwarves without Morri, and trying to conceal a shitload of silver, though Dimitri claims everything will be fine.\n\nEverything goes less fine when you start to realize that Morri was the one who was leading you through this mine maze. Neither you or Dimitri were paying attention to the directions mainly because you were on the look out for demon attacks and fighting them off.\n\nEventually you’re attacked by more of the demons as you proceed to get lost. You and Dimitri get into an argument and begin to blame each other (Though it really is his fault) You both get angry and come to blows, you however get the advantage, not being weighed down by silver. You leave his body for the demons.\n\nYou however don’t get too much further. The demons seem to be coming out in more force and you’re wounded many times. You get scared and confused and you know you’re a dead man when you see Morri’s body being eaten by several of demons. You’ve gone in a complete circle and now you’re hearing that demon chittering from everywhere.\n\nA valiant effort is made by you, but you can’t fight them all. Eventually you are overwhelmed and eaten.\n","page 58":"This is all you’ve ever wanted. Just play music. You’ll be able to do it now for all eternity if possible. You’d be a fool to turn down such a chance.\n\n“Lord Rostov, I wish to play music.”\n\nLord Rostov smiles at your response.\n\n“Ah yes, I was hoping you’d chose the way of the artiste rather than the warrior. Your talents will be better served here. In the meantime you will be shown to your new room. Ladies, I think you two should escort our new bard. Don’t have too much fun, you’ve got a performance tomorrow!”\n\nYou are escorted by a couple of female vampires to your room. They say their names are Glasya and Natasha. They seem to make a fuss over you on your way there which you don’t find completely unwelcome, but you’re still getting used to the whole idea that you’re a vampire just like one of them now, despite also being excited over getting to play music on a steady basis with no hindrances.\n\nThe two vampiresses get even friendlier with you when you get to the room. Natasha begins to take a more aggressive stance and kisses you as the pair of you get on the bed. As the two of you are undressing, Natasha who is on top of you nods to Glasya who leaves the room.\n\nTen minutes later as you’re fully engaged in physical pleasure, Glasya enters the room again with what looks to be a captive human girl. She doesn’t look very old either. Probably a teenager. Her mouth is gagged so she can’t scream out properly.\n\n“Wha…what’s all this?”\n“Shhhh, your passage to true vampirehood…” the Natasha says continuing to grind into you.\n\nThe human girl is dragged over to the bed with fear and tears in her eyes the whole time. Glasya draws out a blade and holds it to her throat.\n\n“Would you like me to cut now or would you prefer I prolong the fear? Perhaps remove her gag first so that you may hear her screams? Or maybe you’d even like to sink your teeth into her yourself?” Glasya asks and licks the side of the young girl’s face.\n“What? Shit! No wait!” you say stopping Natasha, and sitting up. “I thought we were just having some fun here! Not killing young girls!”\n“Why do the two need to be mutually exclusive? Broodling, you have been favored by Lord Rostov, I suggest you count yourself lucky and get with the program…besides you’re one of us now, you will need to feed on blood to survive.” Glasya says with a frown.\n\nYou look at the girl and you shake you head briefly realizing what else it means to be a vampire.\n\n“Alright, alright, I got it. But can’t I like feed on animals first and uh work my way up or something?”\n“Squeamish broodling! You will take the blood of this girl or Lord Rostov will hear of this weakness! While he may be impressed with your music abilities, he will not tolerate weaklings!” Glasya continues to scold.\n“Besides, why do you care whether this…mortal lives or dies now? You do not know her and you are now superior to her in everyway. It’s your right…” Natasha says while kissing on your body.”\n\nYou don’t really have any choice in the matter. You almost curse yourself for getting yourself into this situation. You stay silent for awhile and then speak.\n\n“Very well. Slit her throat, but do it quickly.” You say.\n“(Sigh) Very well.” Glasya replies disappointedly.\n\nThe young girl’s throat is slashed and blood sprays over you and Natasha who greedily opens her mouth to catch it. Glaysa tosses the girl’s dying body onto your chest and begins to undress as well to join you and Natasha in this blood feast.\n\nThe night is definitely long, memorable and decadent. A little piece of you has “died” namely the vestiges of morality.\n\nA few months pass and you don’t even hesitate anymore. You enjoy the blood as well as your playing for Lord Rostov’s court.\n\nA year passes and you’ve become completely oblivious to the worsening of the “outside world”. (Which you don’t even think about since you’re so rapped up in your own pleasures) Each day the Necromancer Lord and Velzix get stronger and you stopped worrying about your family’s future. You don’t even write to them anymore. You’ve become so corrupted in such a short amount of time its actually amazing.\n\nAnother year passes and you’re basically a hedonist. This is what Lord Rostov’s “secret fortress” is all about for the most part. Sure there’s discussion on what should be done about the outside problems, but pleasures of the flesh and blood are mainly the orders of the night. You don’t even realize it, but you ARE literally a “leech” now. All vampires have ever done is leech off of the mortal world. Sure there are the “active ones” but there are far more hedonists. Ironic that the ones who choose to be professional killers, assassins or “heroes” tend to still retain more of their mortalhood.\n\nLord Rostov eventually mentions in passing that he’s finally come up with a perfect plan to kill the Necromancer Lord. He’s managed to come to some sort of deal with that old outcast The Ghoul King to betray him sometime in the near future. The goal is to lure the Necromancer Lord to the fortress itself and kill him directly.\n\nAgain you could really care less, and you’ve become little more than just another hedonist in Lord Rostov’s court. Lord Rostov has it all figured out, you don’t need to worry. You’re safe in this little “world.”\n\nA few months pass and the plan swings into action. One night while you’re playing for the court as usual a loud noise is heard in the foyer and the sounds of shouting and crashing is heard. Lord Rostov takes a few of his concubines and tell everyone else to stay put, though everyone is a little curious. Even you.\n\nYou go back to playing a little bit and things are starting to return to their “original state” since everyone figures Lord Rostov has the matter well in hand.\n\nSoon another noise is heard which sounds like the shrieking and screaming of multiple people.\n\n“AAAAAARRRGH!”\n“LORD ROSTOV! NO!”\n“GET HIM!”\n“KILL THE NECROMANCER!”\n\nEveryone for once goes into a battle mode to rush to Lord Rostov’s aid. A deformed and ugly creature runs into you, while you’re trying to wrap your mind around this chaos.\n\n“Get outta my way broodling! He’s gonna kill us all! I’ve fucked up…heh, but at least the rest of you fuckers are going to die!” he growls at you while desperately looking for a place to hide.\n\nYou don’t know what to do, but suddenly you feel a presence overcome you. Like someone is controlling your mind. This isn’t even like Lord Rostov, its even more powerful and its growing stronger…\n\nYou continue to hear the screams of vampires as you can’t help but approach the way to the slaughter. You see vampires killing each other in the hallway! How is this possible? But you know why, it’s HIM…\n\nThe Necromancer…or whatever he is now has managed to enforce his will even over vampires. You see him in the distance. He’s not even dirtying his hands killing all of you himself. You can feel his loathing for your kind and then you’re completely pulled into his domination.\n\n“And now little blood leech you shall join your brethren…” you hear him whisper in your mind.\n\nAnother vampire suddenly punches you in the back of the head. You attempt to get up, but then feel a foot to the face followed by a sword going through your back. At this point you feel a something you haven’t felt in a long time, fear.\n\nThen your head is ripped off in the ensuing bloodbath. Later after total victory has been achieved, the Great Lich Lord burns your body along with the rest of the truly dead vampires.\n","page 16":"Fuck this. He’s lying and even if he isn’t, making a deal with a demon is never a good idea. You’ve heard the stories and you’ve seen the former Tulan “citizens” that debased themselves just in order to live to serve their demon masters. It never ends well.\n\nIf you are going to the infernal realm when you die, you’re still not going to be helping anyone to take you there!\n\n“Well, let me think about it….HEY THERE’S A FUCKING DEMON ATTACK COMING!” you shout at the top of your lungs. You’re pretty sure at least one person heard you.\n“You asshole!” Big Red growls and lunges at you which you dodge out of the way and just focus on getting back to where most of your company is making camp, yelling the whole time.\n\nUpon hearing your warning, everyone scrambles for battle. You can hear the demons bellowing in the distance. They’ll be here in force soon. You quickly climb on to the village rooftops and ready your bow as the demon hordes advance all around you.\n\nThe battle wasn’t as hopeless as Big Red made it seem like it would be (He must’ve ran off as there was no sign of him) however, the Company does take more than the usual casualties. One of the mercenaries starts to openly complain.\n\n“This is just fucking retarded! Why the hell are we doing this shit?” Cal complains.\n“You know the score; you don’t like it you can leave.” The Captain says calmly cleaning off his sword.\n“Yeah and then I don’t get paid, which is when by the way? We’d all like to know when this contract is over! You never did tell us!”\n“Oh that…indefinitely.”\n“WHAT?!” almost everyone exclaims.\n“Look, would you sissies calm the fuck down? We got a break coming up in a few weeks. We go back to the Zalan Empire to get paid, rest, re-equip and whatever else they got there, but after the break we go right back out here. Possibly even deeper.”\n\nAt this point the whole company is turning against the Captain, he doesn’t look worried though.\n\n“Are you fuckin’ kidding me? You’re expecting us to go deeper into this shit? You’re practically asking us to stand in the middle of Hell!”\n“Dunno why you’re protesting, we’re all going to the real infernal plane anyway when we die, might as well get used to it. Look, take it or leave it, I don’t give a shit. If you want to stay, go ahead. If you want to leave now, go ahead. If you want to leave after you get your pay, go ahead. But I’m sure you know by now, if you leave don’t come back ever.” The Captain says and goes back to the abandoned home he was staying in.\n\nThis comment by the Captain makes you think back to Big Red’s little speech, you start wondering about your future while everyone begins talking amongst themselves about what to do next. A lot of them are saying the Boss has lost his mind and is being suicidal. You can’t say you disagree. In fact you’re not sure you want part of this anymore. Your family might need the money, but what good are you dead to them?\n\nA few weeks pass and your company makes its way back to the Zalan Empire. You get your payment. Almost feels like you’re in the “real army” given the formal nature of it. After you get your pay, you’re on your way home where you intend to stay, much like many others are planning to do. However, you bump into the Captain who speaks to you. There’s a hint of alcohol on his breath.\n\n“So can I expect you to stay on lute boy?” he asks bluntly.\n“Erm…well, no Captain. I’m sorry, but going deeper into demon territory is suicide.” you reply..\n“Probably right, but who wants to live forever?”\n“Well I’d like to at least live past the next year.”\n“Hah! So you wish to die an old man in your bed?”\n“Sounds about right.”\n“Then why did you take on such a dangerous line of work in the first place?”\n“My family needed the money.”\n“Ah yes, you are one of the few in the company that has one. One of the fewer still that actually takes care of them…an honorable pursuit. I can respect that.”\n\nYou’re surprised to hear the Captain praise anything that seems honorable.\n\n“I have a family that I take care of too you know.”\n“Yes, I know you are married.”\n“Yeah…but my daughter is a captain in the Zalan army. She’s stationed on the Tulan border as a matter of fact. She might even get transferred to the Grand Alliance army. Don’t know yet.” He says with a hint of pride in his voice, though he tries his best to conceal it.\n\nThe Captain is just full of surprises. You now know that this isn’t some simple death wish, but that he’s taken the job to help her out in a way. You don’t know, but can only imagine what growing up with a dad like him was like. You unsure of how to reply so you just follow up with something.\n\n“Um, that’s great Captain.”\n“Yeah, it’s great. Got a son too…he’s…a wizard. He’s a fuckin’ disappointment… y’know you look back on your life and you wonder what you’ve accomplished and it doesn’t mean shit in the scheme of things, at least not when the world has one foot in Hell and the other in the grave. But still you struggle and fight right? You still remain true to your nature.”\n“Sure I guess so.” You say wondering where the Captain going with this.\n\nThe Captain sighs heavily.\n\n“I guess I’m lucky…killing and battle are in my nature. I get to do it every fuckin’ day and it never seems to be enough, even after all the years and changes… but I bet you didn’t want this shit right? You probably wanted to just play that fuckin’ lute of yours right? You got a gift and its being wasted due to events out of your control…but you still play that thing when you can. It’s in your nature. It’s also in your nature to help out your family because you care about them.”\n“I suppose it is.”\n“Yeah, nature…it’s a fuckin’ bitch.”\n\nThe Captain now looks directly at you.\n\n“Look I’m not gonna beg ya, but you’re one of the best men I got in the damn company, and I’d rather not lose you, so I’ll appeal to your nature. What’s going on in the world today is some fucked up shit. Quite honestly I don’t think it’s going to end well for any of us, but you struggle and fight anyway. The financial aid that you’re providing for your family pales in comparison to what you’re doing in the long term. You’re making the world safer for them so that they might be able to live. We got the Gates of Hell on one side and Death’s Door on the other and both of them need to be fucking closed. I don’t know if that makes us the so called good guys now, but all I know is if there’s an active way I can protect my wife and even help my daughter then I’m gonna do it. What are you going to do?”\n\nThe Captain then leaves you without saying another word.\n\nSome pretty deep words for a man who you never saw as compassionate in anyway. He does make a point though. Lately what has been going in the world is pretty bad and you wonder if not fighting today will just mean putting off fighting tomorrow.\n","page 91":"The creature is too big to fit in the cave if it tries to attack and you need to hide as soon as possible.\n\nYou make a run for it, gagging and stumbling the whole time. Eventually you do get to the cave. You don’t think the creature even saw you.\n\nYou continue to fumble around in the dark cave that you call home. You can still hear weird noises coming from outside and you’re desperate to drown them out as you feel like its doing something to your mind. In fact, you’re feeling a little deranged.\n\n“WHAT?! WHAT?! UNDEAD WEREN’T ENOUGH?! NOW THIS?! HAHAHAHA! YOU CAN’T KILL ME! I’LL SURVIVE! I SURVIVE EVERYTHING! Who am I here? Who goes there?”\n\nYou look around the cave and start seeing the rocky walls transform into writhing masses of worms. You grab your sword and start hacking away, only to fall to the ground half laughing and half crying.\n\n“You don’t understand…I’ve lost it all…(sob) why? WHERE ARE THE GODS? WHY HAVEN’T YOU STOPPED THIS?! DAMN YOU FUCKING ALL! Ha ha ha ha!”\n\nYou look into the small fire that lights your cave and see it change into a blue color. You begin to think you see faces in it.\n\n“Randi? Is that you? I’m sorry…I could still save…”\n\nYou burn your hand badly when you shove it into the flames in some misguided attempt to save your sister who is not there. It’s at this point; you realize you’re losing your mind. You didn’t survive this long just to lose that. You start trying to block out the sounds, but it’s relentless.\n\nAnd that’s when you see your mandolin on the floor nearby. Music. It always takes you to another place. A better place. You can’t play it right now with your burned hand, but your music is always with you. In your mind.\n\nYou begin to focus on one particular song in your head. You close your eyes think of yourself playing. The tune is nearly drowned out by the noise, but eventually the music gets louder and the creature’s noise is getting quieter, until finally that’s all you can hear.\n\nYou have no idea how long you do this for, but eventually you open your eyes again, and everything is normal. The walls are rock, the fire is red. Your hand still hurts, but it will heal.\n\nYou stay in the cave for days, unsure of what to make of all this. Ultimately you leave to explore cautiously, and everything outside seems normal as well. There is no sign that the creature was ever around. You don’t know if it moved on, disappeared, or what.\n\nDid you go temporarily insane? Did all of this really happen? You do know you burned your hand, so you’re pretty sure it did on some level. In any event, you never want to encounter anything like that ever again. Death almost seems preferable than complete madness.\n\nYou’re still shaken up by the experience for months to come but eventually you get over it. Just like you have with every other hardship you’ve faced.\n\nTwenty years pass…\n\nForty years have passed and you feel death closer than ever. Old age has been taking its toll and while you’re somewhat fit for your age you can’t stop the ravages of time.\n\nStill, it’s not just that. It’s the world in general. The place has slowly become a dead world, quite literally from what you’ve seen during your travels.\n\nEventually you abandoned your cave in the mountain when the dead began to congregate in the area. The dwarven settlement was probably attacked. You don’t know, you didn’t stick around. You continued to stay on the move.\n\nAfter a few years of wandering, you noticed dead trees. Not unusual in the lands of the Great Lich Lord, but you were sticking to places at least on the outskirts of his domain. But it didn’t seem to matter. His influence was obviously extending. The magic in your amulet no longer works, and you briefly thought of the pixies. You know they didn’t survive.\n\nSoon grass was no longer growing. Hunting was becoming scarce. Animals were dying out. It almost reminded you of when the farm was going through a rough patch, but this time there would be no recovery. You walked along another shoreline and saw fish and other sea creatures washed up dead in massive quantities.\n\nYou’ve had to fight undead monsters at almost every turn, always having to stay one step ahead before you’re overwhelmed.\n\nEven the air itself feels like it’s harder to breathe no matter where you go.\n\nRight now you’re very far north, where nothing ever existed save ice and snow. You’re living in yet another cave, but you’re pretty sure this one is going to be your tomb. You haven’t eaten in days, as you haven’t spotted a living creature in days. You haven’t seen another intelligent living creature in years.\n\nIt’s very cold, and all you want to do is sleep now. You think you might have one or two more days left tops.\n\nHowever, you’re not allowed to leave just yet…\n\nWhile you’re drifting in and out of consciousness in your weakened state, you suddenly see a dark hooded figure by the fire. You know who it is.\n\n“So…you’ve come for me personally? I didn’t think I was important enough.” you ask.\n“You aren’t really. Let’s just say that I have a lot of free time and with less and less living now, I take a more personal approach whenever I can. Besides, given how remote this place is, I doubt if any of my necromancers could’ve found you anyway. That is if I hadn’t killed them all.”\n\nThe Great Lich Lord’s voice doesn’t sound anything like you thought it might. It’s actually not very scary at all. Almost calm.\n\n“Heh. I killed a necromancer once…” you say.\n“You have my thanks then, one less treacherous fool that I didn’t have to deal with.”\n“You didn’t really need to come all this way you know, I think I was dying before you got here.”\n\nAt this point the Great Lich Lord begins walking around your cave looking at your meager possessions. He immediately notices your very worn mandolin and picks it up.\n\n“Please feel free to take it. I won’t be needing it anymore.” You say.\n“Not sure what I’d do with it. I’m not musically inclined at all. I’m pretty much only good at killing things as you can tell.”\n“Yeah, you’re great at that.”\n“My mistress Catalina likes music though; perhaps she might find it interesting. This looks very old, where did you get it?”\n“Oh in a town that the demons destroyed when they lost their leader Velzix.”\n“Hah. Demons. I think everyone was glad when I got rid of those assholes.” The Great Lich Lord remarks.\n“That thing probably saved my life when I found it. Some weird ass vampire called Warnov wanted me to play for him. Said you were after him or something…”\n“Yes. Vampires weren’t my favorite people. Arrogant creatures. Well they’re dead now. Excuse me, but did you say Warnov?”\n“That was his name. Yes.”\n\nThe Great Lich Lord is silent for a moment and then speaks again.\n\n“I know who you are. I can’t believe it’s you, but I know who you are. I remember before I tracked down and killed old Warnov, he stated that he was glad he heard you play before he died. He also said that if I ever encountered you that I should insist that you play for me before I killed you. Something about your playing being beautiful or something. You also served in the Zalan Empire army. Weren’t you supposed to be a hero or something?”\n\nYou laugh weakly.\n\n“Mostly or something.” You reply.\n“Hm. I wonder if you ever met…” the Great Lich Lord then pauses for a moment. “…nevermind. It’s the past and that no longer matters. So can you still play this thing?”\n“Well of course, but…”\n“Good. We’re leaving this place then, got a job for you.”\nBefore you can speak another word, you feel yourself teleported.\n","page 92":"You’re having difficulty concentrating, but you decide that it would be better to distance yourself from the creature rather than trapping yourself in a cave.\n\nYou attempt to head down the mountain, but you really are feel very sick and dizzy, in fact you’re beginning to feel worse. The ground underneath you doesn’t even feel like jelly now, you’re actually sinking into it like quicksand!\n\n“What the fu…” you say before a sudden powerful wave of nausea that hits you causes you to vomit immediately.\n\nYou try to stop the sinking, but it’s futile and soon you’ve sank all the way it. Oddly you can still breathe; but the terrain has turned to worms and maggots. You can feel them crawling all over you, in your ears and every other orifice of your body.\n\nYou begin to laugh insanely (while the maggots crawl all in it) since your mind has become severely warped at this point and madness has overtaken you as you sink further through the maggot mountain.\n\nYou’re unsure of how long this goes on for since you’ve lost your mind, but whatever was going on eventually stops and everything returns to normal. Unfortunately that doesn’t really help you since you’re still in the mountain which has returned to solid rock where you are now completely embedded in. You die instantly, putting an end to your madness.\n","page 51":"You have to admit, the idea has crossed your mind a bit. A small part of you does wonder about embracing the whole hero image and deliberately doing grand deeds that go beyond the call of your duty. You suppose that you’d at least really feel like one if you did that.\n\nHowever, more often than not real heroes don’t live long. You’re wondering what exactly this Mr. Warnov has in mind for you and given his demeanor, his appearance and just your own feelings of uncertainty about him, you decline. You know your limitations even if others don’t see them. So, no you won’t be hunting down some artifact of unlimited power and then single handedly taking out a Demon Lord or Necromancer Lord in their own throne room.\n\n“No, I don’t think so Mr. Warnov. As I’ve often said, I’m no hero. I’m just doing my job and providing for my family.”\n\nMr. Warnov looks disappointed and sighs, but accepts your decision.\n\n“Very well. This is a shame though. Despite your humble birth you seem to have lots of potential. You could’ve made an excellent addition to our…organization. I’ve also heard your lute playing wasn’t bad either, we don’t have any musically talented types anymore…oh well.”\n\nMr. Warnov leaves rather quickly after his last statement. Something about him seemed very odd and you’re sort of glad you didn’t take his offer. You go back to your target practice for awhile when you suddenly hear an alarm cry out loudly through the fort about a small demon army being sighted over the hill.\n\n“Well back to work…” you say and prepare for battle once again.\n\nTwo years pass…\n\nIt’s been five years since the Nuro Incident and things have gotten worse.\n\nBoth the Necromancer Lord and Velzix have made progress. Too much. The Grand Alliance hasn’t been able to do anything except fight them to a stalemate. All three sides are looking to gain an advantage and somehow you don’t think it’ll be yours.\n\nThe Zalan Empire has become increasingly totalitarian. It’s been increasing its influence over how the Grand Alliance should be run and its strategies. Some of Zalan’s officers have been transferred to become more prominent in leading and commanding the bulk of the Grand Alliance army. You’re not sure if this isn’t a bad idea. Bullying or not, one final voice in matters would probably help the Grand Alliance at this point. There’s been some grumbling by other nations though.\n\nHowever it’s also begun several repressive internal measures to keep itself safe. Your mom has mentioned in letters back to you of seeing routine patrols now near the farm. Talks of seizing private property for the good of the Empire are being discussed. You don’t really like the sound of that, but it’s not really like you can do anything about it. You can only take solace in the fact that being part of the Zalan army will at least result in your family not becoming homeless. They would probably still be able to live and work on the farm…it just wouldn’t be your family’s anymore. There’s also talk of a draft. You don’t like the sound of that either. Your brother Mallack would certainly be conscripted now. You can’t imagine him dealing with the things you’ve had to face. You hope it doesn’t come to that.\n\nYour position at Virtue is looking worse and worse each day. Parts of the fort are severely damaged, you’re short on man power and you don’t even have any decent wizards or healers. You’ve attempted to talk to Captain Eckard about withdrawing and falling back to a safer position, but he won’t hear of it. This fort is NOT to be abandoned.\n\nThe only good thing is that there’s apparently been a small contingent of mercenaries severely messing up things for Velzix in his own territory. They must be incredibly brave or completely mad for Zalan gold to perform such a task. You can’t help but think that maybe YOU would be there right along side them, if you’d joined up with that mercenary company years ago. A sobering thought.\n\nTime to go on patrol again. You gather up some soldiers and get ready. You look at all of them and wonder which ones won’t be coming back this time. You look at yourself and wonder if you will. A few years ago, everyone coming back alive was at least a possibility, but now it’s not even certain.\n\nYou go out and change up your routine path again. Always have to be different, can’t become predictable.\n\nA couple of imps attack. Nothing to worry about. Easily dispatched. You know you’ll encounter worse before the day is over though.\n\nA group of Tulan “citizens” led by their demon overseer attacks you next. Made up of hapless slaves and misguided idiots who think serving the demons is going to pan out in the long run.\n\nFinally you come across something a little more unusual. A small group of dwarves fighting off a large demon ambush. They look ragged, wounded and in dire need of help. So you help them.\n\nYou unleash five arrows into the head of an Eviscerator before two of your number are fried by a hellfire blast from a Flame Child. The fighting doesn’t get any cleaner from there. You see another one of your members getting shredded, before a path is cleared for the dwarves to follow you back to the fort. One of their own chooses to stay behind to give the rest a chance to escape. As all of you run, a large explosion is heard followed by several yelps, howls and screams. The dwarf has blown himself up with whatever explosives the dwarves are fond of making.\n\nFinally you get back to the fort where it’s relatively safe, and all you’re thinking about is how you’ll have to do this all over again tomorrow. You retire to your private room where you play your lute and hope you aren’t disturbed by another attack on the fort. Happily, that doesn’t happen, but you are disturbed by one of the dwarves you rescued earlier instead. He’s come to thank you.\n\n“Hey lad, I just want to say thanks to your actions at least a few of us survived from our clan. Such as it is now. Something about you looks very familiar. Normally you humans all look the same but…ah hah! You’re that lad who I saved near that farm five years ago! Looks like you returned the favor! Stagir’s the name.”\n\nYou didn’t realize it either, but then with all the fighting and the chaos you’d barely survived during that particular day, you weren’t really paying attention to faces. You were just glad someone came along when they did.\n\n“Yeah…small world I guess. So what happened to your clan?”\n“Wiped out lad.” Stagir says mournfully. “At least when you humans were fighting each other you didn’t mess with us, but getting caught between the undead and demons…well it’s a bit different.”\n“The undead are that far now?” you ask.\n“Aye. They and the demons have been involved in skirmishes here and there. Got no problem with evil fighting evil, but it was just our bad luck that my clan was caught in the middle. The demons are evil incarnate to be sure, but the undead…I dunno. Something worse about them. In the final days, I had to kill clan members who I once called friends and family because of the fucking necromancers raising them from the dead. Some stayed behind to fight since they refused to run. They’d rather die than run from their home. Normally I’d agree, but after seeing that this was a losing battle, some of us decided that it would be better to run. After all we would just be raised again to be used as puppets of the necromancers when we die. Not even free will to choose, or the threat of a demon’s whip. You just become one of them. Can’t let that happen to me. Never.”\n\nYou know something of it, having had to do a little of that five years ago at Nuro, but actually killing undead parodies of family members would be pretty horrific.\n\nStagir attempts to lighten the mood a bit by asking you about what you were playing before he interrupted. When you tell him, he tiches and says something about how elven songs are nothing compared to dwarven ones. You never really thought of dwarves having a musical interest before, but Stagir boasts about how they have quite an extensive musical history.\n\nHe takes the lute from you and shows you a couple of dwarven songs, breaking strings in the process. His insistent singing accompanying the songs isn’t exactly pleasant either. He complains about the human made strings not being strong enough to play the songs properly, but thanks you again for saving his life before leaving.\n\nEvery now and then you play these songs for your new dwarven allies who have taken it upon themselves to strengthen and rebuild the fort the “proper dwarf way”. They seem to appreciate it. You’re a little more careful with the strings and don’t indulge in the singing though. (But unfortunately for the rest of the fort, the dwarves do)\n\nA few months pass and the demon attacks seem to decrease. The strengthened fort certainly helps, but something else is going on. Eventually you’re seeing less and less of them. Eventually some ragged refugees come to the fort and after a bit of babbling and thanking the gods, a few of them explain.\n\nThere are a couple of conflicting stories, but it would seem Velzix is dead! He was killed by something or someone. Consensus seems to be that the mercenary leader died in battle with him though. Without Velzix’s leadership the demons are fighting amongst themselves and the realm is in complete disarray. The Grand Alliance is taking steps to retake the land immediately before the Necromancer Lord gets it. The Zalan Empire in particular is closer though, so naturally YOUR nation is going to get that land first!\n\nWhile things may be looking up somewhat, they aren’t necessarily looking up for you. Captain Eckard has orders to begin an attack immediately. You aren’t looking forward to it mainly because you’ll probably encounter an undead army in the process.\n\nYou don’t have a choice though except for what role you can serve. Thanks to your skills and rank. You can either lead troops as normal, or be part of a scouting party.\n","page 94":"You find yourself in a very ornate yet definitely dark chamber. All manner of symbols related to death exist here. You could only be in the Great Lich Lord’s tower in Nuro. You never thought you’d ever be here. The last time you were anywhere near Nuro was forty years ago and things were much different.\n\n“Welcome to Aftermath, my musical guest. As I said, I’m not much for music, but Catalina is and I’m sure she would love to hear you play. She…” The Great Lich Lord pauses again. “She hasn’t been feeling well lately and I think this would help out. Just take seat in that chair over there. Here’s your mandolin.”\n\nThis almost surreal. You didn’t expect your last moments on this world to be like this. Lacking any other ideas you slowly go over to sit on the chair, while the Great Lich Lord goes to get his mistress Catalina. They better hurry up because you feel like you’ve done more than knocking on death’s door; you’re quite literally in his home. The proximity of being so close to the Great Lich Lord is speeding up your death.\n\nThe Great Lich Lord soon arrives with Catalina and you look upon her. She’s very beautiful. You had heard stories about her before decades ago when you were still serving in the army. She looks young, though she has to be much older. However, you can tell she’s not exactly moving very fast and taking her time. It’s apparent that despite her skill in necromancy that she’s suffering from the effects of the Great Lich Lord’s death aura. She must be powerful indeed to be able to withstand his proximity everyday. She must also love him very much to do it.\n\nYou briefly think of how someone could ever love such a being, or how such a being is even capable of love. But given how you see them interact, there it is.\n\nThis also starts to make you angry. Why are they allowed such a thing? They’re the bad guys here. You never did anything wrong and you lost everyone you ever loved or cared about. You begin to tear up, but it’s in frustration rather than sadness. All the past pain and suffering that you’ve ever experienced has come back to hurt you one last time.\n\n“Okay, start playing.” The Great Lich Lord says.\n“No.” you remark.\n“What?”\n“You heard me. No.”\n“I don’t think you’re in any position to defy me.”\n“Oh I think I’m in every position. What the hell are you going to do to me? I’m fuckin’ dead already! You’ve already taken everything away from me! My friends and acquaintances died because of you! I lost my home because of you! My family and loved ones died because of you! I had to kill my own mother because she became one of your undead minions! My siblings, all fuckin’ dead! All I have left is my music! And now you want me to give that away to you too? NO! I’ll DIE with it!”\n\nAfter this outburst the Great Lich Lord replies in kind.\n\n“Insolent mortal! Do you forget who I am? You think dying will save you? Think again! I will kill you and raise you as a fucking zombie and MAKE you play for us in a pink dress if it so amuses me! Now play and perhaps that won’t be your fate!”\n\nThe Great Lich Lord’s voice now sounds more menacing. More like what you thought, but you don’t care, you’ve got nothing to lose at this juncture. It is at this point Catalina steps in.\n\n“I don’t think that will be necessary dear. You just let me handle this. You go in the next room and cool off or something.”\n\nThe Great Lich Lord agrees to this and hugs Catalina, before walking off. Catalina now walks towards you.\n\n“You’ll have to forgive my beloved’s outburst. He goes a little over the top when it comes to me. Especially now. So much has happened. He’s changed so much and continues to change even now. He doesn’t express it, but I think it’s always gotten to him.”\n“I don’t have to forgive shit. Am I supposed to feel sympathy? He’s caused all this…and you too! How can you stand by him? You’re still alive! You could probably kill him and stop this before the entire world is dead!”\n“Oh I doubt if I could, even if I so desired, which I don’t. My feelings for him and the reasons…well the heart wants, what the heart wants. I sometimes worry about what he will do after I’m gone though. He’s in great denial. He knows I cannot fight off his overwhelming aura forever. I suppose in some ways, bringing you here to play for me was some vain hope of making me feel better. And it will, in its own way…”\n\nYou still can’t believe that she’s trying to make them out to be the victims.\n\n“Look I don’t care about what the hell you two death freaks want, I know what the hell I’ve gone through and it’s all your fault. Fuck the both of you. You haven’t had to deal with the pain I’ve gone through.”\n“Perhaps not. But do you think you are the only one on this world who’s suffered? What makes your life and those close to you so special? Nothing. You and everyone else whoever lived on this dying world are equal. You, your family, even me. The only person who isn’t equal, is in the next room. We’ve all lost those close to us at some point. Yes, even my beloved and he’ll lose another when I’m gone. We’ll all be long dead and he’ll probably still be on this world by himself with nothing to do. And that, I’m convinced will be the greatest suffering of all. Life without end? No thank you. When my time comes, I will embrace it.”\n\nYou’re very surprised to hear a necromancer say that.\n\n“My beloved cannot help what he is. For whatever reason, he was gifted with the art of death. He’s become it. It’s his nature. You can’t be angry with a force of nature. It has to simply be.”\n\nYou want to argue, you want to fight, you want to bring up every moral debate you can think of, but to be quite honest you can’t. Part of it is it wouldn’t make any difference. Part of it is you’re tired of fighting, you can’t do it anymore and you don’t have strength at this point. The other part is that in a way what she’s said makes some sense and is correct.\n\nIt also makes you think about your “nature”. It was to play music. You never got to live the life you wanted, but during your lifetime, music always seeped in somehow. It always found a way.\n\nCatalina continues to speak.\n\n“Now you certainly don’t have to play. That’s your choice. I will make sure that my beloved does not turn you into dress wearing zombie though. It would be a shame though. You are not completely unfamiliar to me. I do have some knowledge of who you are and I have heard stories of your playing. I would like to hear it played while you still had the passion and energy behind it. The living spark that can only invoke such things.”\n“…I’ll play…” you say with a heavy breath that took some effort for you.\n“You will?”\n“Yes…what did you want to hear?”\n\nCatalina smiles.\n\n“I don’t know, whatever you like I suppose. Just as long as it has a nice soothing melody.”\n“Okay then.”\n“Hold on, I must get my beloved before you start. I must ask though, what changed your mind to play?”\n“Nothing. It’s my nature.”\n\nCatalina soon returns with the Great Lich Lord and they both sit in their respective thrones. Catalina tells you to play, which you do so.\n\nYou watch the pair of them look at each other as you play. You would appear that Catalina is pleased with her “gift”. You don’t know about the Great Lich Lord, since you can’t see his face, but you assume that if she’s happy, then he’s happy.\n\nYou see them hold hands and look at each other as you enter the second verse of the song. At this point you begin to close your eyes and just let the music and instinct guide your fingers. You can feel your life slip away, but it doesn’t matter. You’ve been taken to a different place. A better place.\n\nYou smile and wave to your family. You can see them all so clearly. All of them are there. You’re getting closer. They’re ready to accept you with open arms.\n\nLast verse. Not much energy left, but you’re nearly there. You won’t have to worry about anything anymore. Heart slowing down. You’re with them now. Everything will be so good again. Your music has saved you one last time.\n\nOne last note.\nOne last breath.\nYou’re home.\n\n\n\n“Well, he certainly looked happier than he did earlier.”\n“Yes, yes he did. Set his body on fire dear.”\n“You don’t want him around to play for you later?”\n“No, I don’t think that performance could ever be replicated.”\n","page 53":"Dear Mom,\n\nJust another letter from me, letting you know I’m still alive. Though I’m sure with my newest title of “Demon Slayer” you probably knew I was.\n\nMore exaggerations of course. I do my job to be sure, but there are plenty of other men and women my age or even younger that doing just as much as I am and they don’t seem to get any credit. Of course many of them have also been killed. I’ve always tried to keep everyone alive under my command, but I know it’s a futile endeavor.\n\nThe fighting has been getting worse up here, the demons I think have finally gotten more organized. Though what alarms me more is hearing that the Necromancer Lord has finally broken out of Nuro and taken over the Brot Kingdom. I thought the Grand Alliance was supposed to stop this sort of thing.\n\nI’m tired of all this. I feel like playing right now, sorry for the short letter.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family\n\nYour son\n","page 97":"You’ve never even heard of Quillars before, but they still sound less dangerous than the Tulan Border, that place is only going to get worse, you know it.\n\n“I’ll take the Retlad assignment sir.”\n“Hm. Smart. Here’s your first month’s pay, I suggest you live it up here in Zal, for the couple of days you have off before you leave.”\n\nYou take the small bag and look inside. This will certainly help your family. You take a few coins for yourself and then ask if arrangements can be made to have your payment sent to your family from now on. He tells you yes, but asks that surely that you will still want some of it. You agree to just taking 10% of it. You don’t need much.\n\n“Sheesh, living bare minimum huh? Don’t you want to eat anything other than military rations every once in awhile?” Kosser questions again.\n“Nah. If I need extra food, I’ll just hunt.”\n“You know even the booze and brothel girls in Retlad aren’t THAT cheap. You sure you don’t want more?”\n“Nope. I’ll be fine. My family needs that money more than I do.”\n“Alright then, family man.”\n\nYou exit the barracks and wander the city a bit. You find it very interesting. You sort of wish you could stay longer to take in more sights. However one thing catches your eye. A small store and in the window is a lute. Looks almost like the one you had before it was taken away from you in basic training. You haven’t gotten a chance to play in six months and you’d really like to…\n\nHey you’re a soldier now, you’ve proven yourself. You figure you can take one personal belonging with you to Retlad as long as you keep them packed properly. You enter the store and with the little money you have you buy the lute. You spend the most of the day and the next practicing it. You didn’t forget as much as you thought. You also finish up writing a letter to your family and give it to a Zalan messenger carrier.\n\nFinally the third day arrives for you to move out. A couple of officers arrive to take most of your other fellow cadets. Mostly to the Tulan border, however, it would appear you have a different escort. A young man in loose robe approaches you. He looks like a wizard, but you wonder for how long since he seems about your age.\n\n“Hey, are you the one going to the Retlad Kingdom?” he asks\n“Yeah, who are you?”\n“I’m Wessel. And don’t you dare get cute and call me weasel, or I’ll have to blast you with a lightning bolt.”\n“I wasn’t planning on it.” You say which causes Wessel to start laughing.\n“Geez, I was just fucking with you. Don’t be so serious! So you ready to go?”\n“Yeah I guess, are you my superior officer?”\n“Huh? Oh no. Look I got our horses waiting outside; we can do all this getting to know you stuff on the way.”\n\nYou and Wessel get on the horses and ride towards your destination. It would appear that you’re the only one from your group to be going, but of course you were the only expert marksman.\n\nWessel begins to tell you more about why he’s with you. In fact he doesn’t really let you do much talking at all. He says he’s a native citizen of the Zalan Empire, but he just graduated from the esteemed magic university in the city state of Nuro. Wessel goes on to and says that when he heard they needed a few wizard over in Retlad, he decided to volunteer to test his skills and get paid while doing it. He explains that the pair of you will be following the orders of a Captain Vhalat.\n\nEveryone knows about Nuro. It’s very famous, and you always wondered what kind of magical wonders existed there, so you’re eager to hear more and he’s all too happy to tell you. Despite Wessel’s primary focus on himself, it sounds like a place you’d want to visit one day.\n\nEventually you arrive at the border and so far the Retlad Kingdom doesn’t look very well kept. The road begins to show evidence of disrepair and the sign posts are broken. You begin to keep your eye out for a possible attack at any second.\n\n“Look! Over there! It’s a village and it’s under attack! Come on!” Wessel yells and rides towards the village in the distance. You try to tell him to wait, but he’s already well on his way, so you ride after him.\n\nYou’ve never seen a Quillar before, but the closer you get to the village, you start seeing humanoid creatures covered in sharp spikes running around at a fast speed which could only be them. They are indeed fearsome looking. You also see a lot of the people running from them, and even a few people dressed in protective gear similar to yours…not that its doing them much good.\n\n“Alright you prickly bastards here’s something for ya!” Wessle shouts riding into the village with one hand raised in the air for a lightning blast attack. He shows no fear. You have no idea if all wizards are like this, but he’s either got to be brave, stupid or just suicidal. Of course he could be all three. Up until now you always thought wizards were supposed to be meek types that didn’t charge into battle and preferred to kill from afar. You guess you were wrong.\n","page 52":"You have to admit, the idea has crossed your mind a bit. A small part of you does wonder about embracing the whole hero image and deliberately doing grand deeds that go beyond the call of your duty. You suppose that you’d at least really feel like one if you did that.\n\n“Okay Mr. Warnov. I’ll do it.” You exclaim.\n“You sure?”\n“Not really, but if I’m already in the shit, I might as well go all the way with it. What do I do next?”\n\nWarnov looks around again to see if anyone is about before answering.\n\n“Well just take a deep breath, relax and uh… brace yourself!”\n“Huh?”\n\nBefore you can react Warnov moves faster than you’ve ever seen anything move. In fact you don’t really see him move at all before he’s biting your neck! He puts his other hand over your mouth so you can’t yell out and easily knocks your hand away from feebly attempting to draw a weapon.\n\nYou fall into unconsciousness as your blood is drained from you at a rapid rate. Death soon follows…\n\nA few minutes later you wake up outside the fort.\n\n“Ah you’re up. Sorry about surprising you like that, but I had to work quickly. Someone else could’ve popped up and that would’ve gotten complicated…”\n\nYou quickly check your neck which is completely healed now, but you know what’s just occurred! You feel a cold numbness throughout your body and you freak out.\n\n“I’M DEAD! I’M FUCKIN DEAD! And you’re a vampire!”\n“Shhhh! Keep your voice down! Yeah, you figured it out. Nice detective work, now let’s get down to this hero business. Though we should really get to Rostov’s and talk about all this.”\n“I’m…I’m dead! I’m one of you! I don’t want to be an undead thrall for the Necromancer Lord!”\n“What? No, no, no, we’re not… look I’ll explain later, let’s just…”\n\nYou pull away from Warnov when he tries to help you up. You feel your reflexes are much quicker. This temporary curiousity in your new found abilities allows Warnov to calm you down.\n\n“WAIT! Just stop! (Sigh) Okay look I’ll try to give you the condensed version right now. We vampires aren’t on the side of the Necromancer Lord. If anything he’s fucking things up for us. We like to keep a balanced order as it were. The last time we sided with some megalomaniacal necromancer it nearly resulted in our extinction. Never again. In fact we’ve been manipulating shit for centuries just to make sure something like this didn’t happen. Somebody really fucked up in the observation department on this one!”\n\nWarnov goes on to explain that his superior, Lord Rostov will be able to explain better and in more detail, but that you have to come with him now.\n","page 96":"6 months pass…\n\nSix months of the most grueling physical training you’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with! However you fared better than some of your fellow cadets. Guess all that farm living paid off.\n\nYou’ve certainly improved what combat skills you had, but your marksmanship has improved greatly. You know that Drill Sergeant Kosser has been paying special attention to your abilities. You’re not sure if that’s a good thing of not.\n\nIn any event you’re being told where your first assignment is going to be. Most of those in your group are being sent to Tulan border. Not the most pleasant assignment. The fighting is getting worse there.\n\nWhat started as a minor border dispute has turned into a series of battles with neither side making too much progress. Even before you joined the military you’d heard stories of the greedy king who runs the Tulan Kingdom. You heard from traveling merchants about how he allows a few demons to walk around in his lands! Utter madness in your opinion. The Zalan Empire might be a little strict on the rules and regulations, but better that than demons letting walking around, in your opinion they should all be killed on sight regardless on whether they’re obeying the “law” or not, they’re evil.\n\nYou sit anxious on your bed in the barracks as name after name gets called off. Finally Kosser calls off your name, and you fully expect to get sent to the Tulan border.\n\n“I want to talk to you in private.” Is what you hear instead.\n\nThis makes you even more nervous. What’s he going to do? Send you on? A mission to assassinate the Tulan King?\n\nAfter everyone else has gotten there assignments you follow Kosser back to his office. He sits down and speaks direct.\n\n“Alright farmboy, I’m sure you’ve noticed me watching your marksmanship skills. You’re one of the best ones that have come in here for awhile. You have a natural talent and you’ve only improved it through training. It would be a blessing to have someone like you up at the Tulan border. The gods know we could use anything to help break the stalemate there.”\n“…but?” you ask hoping that there is one.\n“But…your skills might be better served in a place that has a better mortality rate, yet still needs taking care of.”\n“Where’s that sir?”\n“Here.” Kosser points to a map to a nearby location. It’s the Retlad Kingdom. You can’t imagine what’s going on there, since as far as you know, you’re Zalan is at peace with them.\n“Retlad? I thought we’re at peace with them?”\n“We are…in fact rumors are saying we’ll probably incorporate them into the empire in the near future. I dunno how much you know about politics out there on the farm, but Retlad is basically a bankrupt kingdom. Their dumb ass royalty spent a shitload of their treasury on building ships in some vain attempt to find more land mass on this world. Hah! Doesn’t exist! We learned than centuries ago! Anyway now they don’t have enough to pay for a proper military and their kingdom is being overrun by hostile Quillar tribes. They want us to help. Begging us practically and we have, but it’s a pain in the ass. Quillars are fast and as their name suggests shoot multiple sharp quills at their enemies. I’ve seen them go through plate armor.”\n“That doesn’t sound good.”\n“No, it’s not good. The Retlad knight orders got decimated within two months of the first invasion wave. We’re taking a better approach. We need to have equally quick troops that can at least match the fire power. We’ve sent a couple of war wizards, but most of them are serving on the Tulan border. Gunpower weapons are a little too slow for this sort of thing, so we’re looking for people good with a bow. Quick enough to at least get a few shots off from a distance and run. Because hit and run tactics are what the Quillars excel at, so you’ll have to do likewise.”\n\nKosser pauses his talking for a moment. You take this opportunity to interject a question.\n\n“And this assignment you say has a lower mortality rate?”\n“Well, we haven’t sent as many people there yet, but so far we’ve made a little more progress there than at the Tulan border. But of course I won’t say it’s a safe assignment. Those Quillar bastards are vicious and merciless. Up to you farmboy. You’re getting a bonus here. You’re actually getting to choose your assignment. Not many that get out of boot camp get that privilege.”\n\nSome “privilege”\n","page 22":"You know who the hell this is, it’s the Necromancer Lord. Even if you are fast enough to get a shot at him, you doubt the arrow is going to connect. He’s probably got all kinds of magical shields to protect him for whatever it is he’s here for. You begin looking for your best route of escape and slowly start backing away.\n\nThe Captain on the other hand speaks directly to his son. He doesn’t even show any fear. They speak for a moment and things get very tense, you’re about ready to run, but things take a sudden turn for the very strange.\n\nThe Necromancer Lord has proposed a temporary alliance to assassinate Velzix. The Captain is hesitant about this at first, but an agreement is made on payment and he accepts.\n\nThe Captain then informs all of you in more detail of what’s going on.\n\n“Alright men, we’re gonna go storm the Gates of Hell and close those fuckers for good. My…son there is going to provide magical support. He’s also going to be providing a shitload of money for this job. The stipulation is we can’t tell ANYBODY about this shit. I’m fucking serious. Word gets out that we were working with the fucking Necromancer Lord, we’ll all be hanged, regardless of so called heroic deeds of killing demons. We’re all in this together and there ain’t no backing out, because this deal is made. And if you think you’re gonna step out on me now, that ain’t in the plan. I’ll just kill you and have my son raise your undead ass to help us anyway!”\n“What?! You just decided this for us?” Cal exclaims.\n“Yeah? What of it? I’ve ALWAYS made all the decisions for your dumb ass! It’s why YOU’RE still working for me, because it’s lucrative! This ain’t gonna be any different. Plus we get to take fucking credit for killing a damn demon lord. Think of all the pussy you’ll get from that fucking fame eh? Now stop bitching and let’s go!”\n\nYou can’t say you’re enthusiastic about this, but it would appear you have little choice in the matter.\n\nAs you travel to Velzix’s fortress you overhear some of the conversations the Captain is having with his son. A strained relationship to be sure. They make a lot of cutting barbs to each other, each criticizing the other for various things. It’s obvious that they can’t stand each other, but are a lot more alike than either one wants to admit.\n\nIt makes you glad when you encounter the occasional demon skirmish on the way, since it at least it decreases the tension and possibility that the Captain’s son is going to finally lose his temper and kill everyone due to his father’s words. Eventually you arrive without any more problems. You enter Velzix’s fortress through the secret way that was discovered long ago.\n\n“Dumb ass demons, we’ve been using this entrance for like a year now and they still haven’t caught on!” the Captain remarks to his son.\n\nYou make good progress in the fortress and then…\n\n“There they are, just like Velzix said they would be!” a demon guard shouts.\n\n“Haven’t caught on yet huh?” the Necromancer Lord says, looking at the Captain.\n“Quit yer bitchin’ and start doin that death magic thing!”\n\nYou proceed to do battle with the demon and mortal guards that attempt to stop you. The Necromancer Lord starts to raise the mortal guards after they’re killed, but it begins to unnerve you though when the Necromancer Lord starts raising your own fallen dead.\n\nPretty soon it’s just the Necromancer Lord, the Captain, you, Cal and a bunch of corpses fighting off what seems to be an endless supply of Hell’s own. You begin to wonder if Velzix already got that portal working.\n\nAs you get closer to Velzix’s inner sanctum even the undead troops are being decimated at an alarming rate. You’ve been wounded several times and extremely tired. You don’t want to think about any of this, even in the heat of battle you start to take your mind elsewhere with a tune inside your head.\n\n“Fuck man! We’re gonna die here!” Cal screams as he attempts to fight a horned demon which has obviously got the advantage over him. You feel a demon blade in your back causing you to fall to the floor. At this point nothing but music fills your mind; bloodshed and battle surround your prone body.\n\n“Fuckers are without end! Come on! Raise these fuckers and let’s go!” you hear the Captain yell followed by “Hah, no lying down on the job anymore Cal!”\n\nYou’re not quite dead yet though, and the Necromancer Lord and his dad aren’t waiting around so they continue on quickly leaving you behind.\n\nAs your life force ebbs and more demon guards run past your body, you don’t know if what you did was worth it or even the right thing. All you know is you did what you could and hope your actions may have made some sort of difference and increased the chances of your family’s future well being.\n\nYou then smile. You’ll see them again someday.\n\n“Yeah…I believe that…” you allow yourself to think as you die.\n\nBig Red was wrong about your fate. There was no Hell, just peace.\n","page 66":"If the information that the vampire said was true, you think it might be better to inform your superiors of it so that something can be done now. It won’t do any good to run off with this vital info and let them find out when it’s too late and your “freedom” won’t mean anything as death takes over the world.\n\nYou meet up with the rest of your men who are calling out your name. They ask if you’re okay and you reply you are, but you need to inform the captain of the new info you learned.\n\nWhen you return, you tell Captain Eckard exactly what happened, but instead of stopping to assess this new info or taking it immediately to his superior, he dismisses it! He said the vampire was probably just fucking around with you.\n\n“That vampire was probably toying with you like a cat would a mouse. He probably has your scent now, so he’ll hunt and attack you later. The stories he’s told you are probably just to keep your mind occupied with nonsense as well as to give us misinformation. Hell, he’s fucking undead! He’s probably WORKING with the Lich Lord!”\n“But…but it was an agent of the Zalan Empire. Agent Warnov. He…”\n“NO! He LOOKED like Warnov. Vampire can change their form you know! And even if it was the real Warnov, he’s undead now and working for the enemy!”\n“Well if that’s the case shouldn’t we still inform head quarters immediately? He probably had lots of vital information that…”\n“Look, the only thing we need to do is take the territory of the former Tulan Kingdom before the undead do! THAT’S our primary concern! So I’ll have no more discussion about it sergeant! Get ready to march tomorrow! We’re heading for the former capitol!”\n\nYou leave Eckard’s tent and shake your head at his stupidity, but there’s not much you can do about it now. You do decide that you’re going to inform another high ranking officer when you can though.\n\nSoon the company is on the move to its destination. It gets more dangerous the closer you get though. You’re getting ambushed by demon bands of them all the time. Not enough to destroy you of course, but certainly enough to whittle your numbers down. Captain Eckard gives you more troops to supply your losses, but by the time you get to the capitol, the whole company has lost at least a third of its original strength.\n\nThings don’t get any better at the capital. Most of the citizens there have been so corrupted or beat down by the demons at this point that they’ve either sold their own souls to Hell or gone completely mad. You’re attacked by them and a few of the demon hold outs.\n\nBy the time you subdue and hold the territory, you’re down to half of the company’s original strength.\n\nThen after a few days the undead arrive.\n\nCaptain Eckard’s rather inept handling of things don’t get any better. Instead of shoring up the defenses of the capital’s gates and walls and waiting for reinforcements which were going to arrive soon, he orders an open attack on the battlefield!\n\nYou are very reluctant to do this, but again you don’t have any choice now. You fight and barely survive long enough to fallback when Captain Eckard calls for a retreat after finally realizing he’s hopelessly outmatched. Unfortunately he’s just provided more troops for the undead army, as the necromancers in charge raise the recent dead. They also start raising the dead citizens IN the city which haven’t been cleared out!\n\nIt’s an ignoble death as you’re eventually surrounded, overwhelmed and cut down by zombies and skeletons. You join their ranks soon afterwards.\n","page 21":"You know who the hell this is, it’s the Necromancer Lord. You’re never going to get a better chance than now to kill him and put an end to some of the madness that’s going on. You muster up all your courage and quickly raise your bow.\n\n“No! Wait you dumbfuck…” the Captain yells trying to stop you.\n\nYou arrow flies straight towards the Necromancer Lord, but it doesn’t even reach him, a magical shield causes it to bounce off harmlessly. However your actions cause the Necromancer Lord to react defensively and he unleashes a ray of pure black energy which drains you of your life force entirely.\n","page 68":"Dear Mom,\n\nThis will be a quick letter, we’re moving out and I can’t say I’m thrilled with it.\n\nLast time I wrote, I was talking about how bad the recent demon attacks were, well I’m sure you already heard about the demon lord Velzix being killed. I suppose this is a good thing, since its one less enemy to worry about, but I’m being sent to retake the lands previously owned by him and reports say the Necromancer is as well.\n\nI still haven’t gotten completely over what happened at Nuro. I need to be strong though since I’m probably going to be doing a lot of combat with the undead in the future.\n\nOddly I’m not even worried about myself so much right now; I’m more concerned about you guys. I know the Zalan Empire has been creating a lot of rules lately. Talks of seizing private property and drafts cause me to worry about you all. Never thought that on the eve of possibly facing undead hordes again, it’s our own government that I have concerns about.\n\nArgh! This is something I’d rather discuss with you in person, of course if I ever got a chance to visit every once in awhile!\n\nOkay, the Captain’s starting to call everyone.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family.\n\nYour son\n","page 67":"Last time you were wounded and had the misfortune of running into demons. Well you aren’t wounded this time and you’re pretty sure you won’t be running into too many more demons. You’ll be able to pull it off this time. You can’t do this army shit anymore, as much as you want to help your family out, you’ve got to live your own life regardless of what the future holds. You aren’t even worried about committing an executionable offense.\n\nYou easily sneak away as you hear your men call out your name looking for you. You’re glad you didn’t leave too much back at the fort, except your lute, but you’ve got your newly acquired mandolin to make up for it. Eventually you’re away from civilization altogether.\n\nWhile you’re out in the wilderness you think about your family again, and you have to at least let them know you’re still alive. Maybe you can still do something about them, after all it doesn’t sound like the Zalan Empire is becoming a great place to live anymore. Perhaps you could convince them to move?\n\nIt takes a week of sneaking around and keeping out of sight, but eventually you make it back home. Zalan looks a lot different; hell home looks a lot different. There was a small wooded area near your farm, but most of the trees have been cut down now. You also remember fewer patrols. Your house looks in better condition however. You guess at least your family seems a lot safer, but for how long?\n\nYou knock on the door in the middle of the night and your sister Randi answers, Not too surprising as she always was a night owl when she was little. At least she used to be little. The passing of the years and she’s now a teenager and grown quite a bit. You’ve been away so long.\n\nWhat does surprise you is the flintlock pistol that she’s currently pointing at you!\n\n“Whoa! Hold on! It’s me, your brother!” you say.\n“…it is? It is you!” she exclaims and puts down the gun before hugging you.\n“What the hell are you doing with a pistol?”\n“The money you sent us allowed to buy new things you know and a traveling merchant was selling this for cheap!”\n“No I mean, what are YOU doing with one? You’ll blow your damn head off with that thing! Those things are unstable.” You scold.\n“What are you doing home? Are you on leave?”\n“Uh…that’s a long story. Wake up the rest of the family; I have to talk to you all.”\n\nRandi complies while you step inside the house and take in its new look. Eventually your Mom enters, followed by your brother Mallack and finally your youngest brother Calwin and sister Makana.\n\nYou all sit down at the dining room table. (You realize you haven’t done that with your family in years) and you tell them everything. You get a lot of worried reactions. More for you than the other world impending doom stuff though. At least you know that they care.\n\n“You gotta get back to the army right now! Say you got captured by something and it took you awhile to escape!” Mallack exclaims.\n“While I’m sure that MAY work, I just don’t want to do it…I can’t take this anymore. The whole time I’ve been in the damn army, my music has kept me sane. I’ve noticed it have an effect on others as well. Never thought it would. I mean I have talent and…”\n“…you feel like you’ve wasted your life?” your mother replies.\n\nYou pause for a moment. You almost want to say yes, but you can’t even if you wanted to. You haven’t wasted it, its just you’ve never really had the chance to do what you’ve ever wanted to do.\n\n“No…I guess I haven’t… it’s just…”\n\nYour mother takes your hand and speaks to you.\n\n“I know. It’s not fair. It’s not right. Life isn’t fair and it’s starting to get a whole lot less fair. I know I’ve mentioned it in letters to you, but the Zalan Empire WILL be taking the farm…and it’s looking like Mallack’s going to be drafted if things are going the way they seem to be.”\n“But…see that’s what I’m saying! We could all move! I mean of course I have to go into hiding, maybe Mallack could come with me. And the rest of you could use what money you have left and move to Retlad! It’s a nice place. It’s away from most of the fighting, and there aren’t anymore Quillars there!”\n\nYour mother shakes her head.\n\n“You must be behind in the news, because Retlad is finally going to become part of the Zalan Empire soon, so going there to live wouldn’t make any difference. The Empire can take this farm, but in spirit this will ALWAYS be ours. The Empire has said they will allow us to continue working it and living on the land and even if they didn’t they’d have have to drag us all out and stick our heads on pikes before we’d leave. Your father and his father build this farm up to what it is. Our family is going to be here until the end.”\n“That’s what I’m afraid of…what about you Mallack? You’re probably going to be drafted. You aren’t worried about that?”\n“Sure I am. But what am I going to do, run? Where? From what you described you practically think the whole world is doomed anyway! I might as well take some of the undead bastards out before I go. I was getting bored of the farm anyway. Let Randi take over! Ha ha!”\n\nYour mother addresses you again.\n\n“Son, you know our family. We’ve always done the right thing, even if it doesn’t coincide with what we want…I think you know what you have to do.”\n\nAnd so you do. So you do.\n\nYou spend one night with your family and make the most of it. You all laugh and joke, trying to put all the problems of the world out of your mind and of course before you leave you play a song for them.\n\nEventually you hug them all goodbye and take your leave. More than a few tears are shed on both sides.\n","page 26":"You don’t like the sound of the Quillars and it doesn’t really sound all that much safer. You decide that at the Tulan border you’ll at least be with a few people you already know from boot camp and you’ll be fighting something less scary. (Or at least human)\n\n“I’ll take the Tulan Border assignment sir.”\n“Hm, I’m surprised. Hope your skills come in of some use there. Here’s your first month’s pay, I suggest you live it up here in Zal, for the couple of days you have off before you leave.”\n\nYou take the small bag and look inside. This will certainly help your family. You take a few coins for yourself and then ask if arrangements can be made to have your payment sent to your family from now on. He tells you yes, but asks that surely that you will still want some of it. You agree to just taking 10% of it. You don’t need much.\n\n“Sheesh, living bare minimum huh? Don’t you want to eat anything other than military rations every once in awhile?” Kosser questions again.\n“Nah. If I need extra food, I’ll just hunt.”\n“You know there aren’t many luxuries on the border, but when a traveling merchant shows up, you might regret not having enough money. You sure you don’t want more?”\n“Nope. I’ll be fine. My family needs that money more than I do.”\n“Alright then, family man.”\n\nYou exit the barracks and wander the city a bit. You find it very interesting. You sort of wish you could stay longer to take in more sights. However one thing catches your eye. A small store and in the window is a lute. Looks almost like the one you had before it was taken away from you in basic training. You haven’t gotten a chance to play in six months and you’d really like to…\n\nHey you’re a soldier now, you’ve proven yourself. You figure you can take one personal belonging with you to Tulan as long as you keep them packed properly. You enter the store and with the little money you have you buy the lute. You spend the most of the day and the next practicing it. You didn’t forget as much as you thought. You also finish up writing a letter to your family and give it to a Zalan messenger carrier.\n\nFinally the third day arrives for you to move out. A couple of officers arrive to take all of you. You’re stopped though as you’re picked out.\n\n“Hold up you. What’s that?”\n“It’s a lute sir.”\n“A lute? What the fuck do you think this is? An acting company? Get rid of that thing, you won’t be needing that where you’re going!”\n“But…”\n“You disobeying me soldier?”\n“No sir!”\n“Alright then, get rid of it!”\n\nYou sadly get rid of your lute which you never got to play and basically wasted your money on. You don’t know what you were thinking anyway. You’re in the damn army. You’re going to be doing a lot of fighting and all of that, not playing some stupid instrument. You should’ve realized that the first time it was taken away from you in boot camp.\n\nYou’ve made this choice; you need to just put these dreams of being a “musician” out of your head right now. You weren’t meant to be one, and all those years of deluding yourself in between real work were just fleeting dreams of a teenager. Time to grow up.\n\nWhile you resign yourself to this mindset, you aren’t particularly happy with it. When you get to the Tulan Border you’re even less happy. Your first battle is filled with all the bad stuff that usually accompanies such things. It’s definitely not a fun assignment and your only consolation is that you know your family is getting more financial aid for you doing this.\n\nAfter a few months, you’re absolutely miserable. You don’t have your music to keep your mind off of the conditions and everything is bad here. The fort you’re currently stationed at supplies only the bare minimum of living, no magical back up, the captain is a real asshole and the rest of those you serve with aren’t too much better. Though so many are killed everyday that you never really grow to dislike (or like) anyone that much in that department. More are sent in and more die, it’s like an ongoing cycle, everyone’s so expendable in this ongoing border war that gets worse with each passing month.\n\nIt doesn’t even come to your surprise when the day comes that you’re mortally wounded while on patrol. One of the new soldiers tells you to hold on and that he’ll get help, but you know he won’t get any in time and it wouldn’t matter anyway.\n\nAs you lay dying, your only regret is that you didn’t get to play music like you always wanted to, and now you never will.\n","page 25":"6 months pass…\n\nSix months of the most grueling physical training you’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with! However you fared better than some of your fellow cadets. Guess all that farm living paid off.\n\nYou’ve certainly improved what combat skills you had, but your marksmanship has improved greatly. You know that Drill Sergeant Kosser has been paying special attention to your abilities. You’re not sure if that’s a good thing of not.\n\nIn any event you’re being told where your first assignment is going to be. Most of those in your group are being sent to Tulan border. Not the most pleasant assignment. The fighting is getting worse there.\n\nWhat started as a minor border dispute has turned into a series of battles with neither side making too much progress. Even before you joined the military you’d heard stories of the greedy king who runs the Tulan Kingdom. You heard from traveling merchants about how he allows a few demons to walk around in his lands! Utter madness in your opinion. The Zalan Empire might be a little strict on the rules and regulations, but better that than demons letting walking around, in your opinion they should all be killed on sight regardless on whether they’re obeying the “law” or not, they’re evil.\n\nYou sit anxious on your bed in the barracks as name after name gets called off. Finally Kosser calls off your name, and you fully expect to get sent to the Tulan border.\n\n“I want to talk to you in private.” Is what you hear instead.\n\nThis makes you even more nervous.

It’s the Retlad Kingdom. You can’t imagine what’s going on there, since as far as you know, you’re Zalan is at peace with them.\n“Retlad? I thought we’re at peace with them?”\n“We are…in fact rumors are saying we’ll probably incorporate them into the empire in the near future. I dunno how much you know about politics out there on the farm, but Retlad is basically a bankrupt kingdom.

Anyway now they don’t have enough to pay for a proper military and their kingdom is being overrun by hostile Quillar tribes. They want us to help. Begging us practically and we have, but it’s a pain in the ass. Quillars are fast and as their name suggests shoot multiple sharp quills at their enemies. I’ve seen them go through plate armor.”\n“That doesn’t sound good.”\n“No, it’s not good. The Retlad knight orders got decimated within two months of the first invasion wave. We’re taking a better approach. We need to have equally quick troops that can at least match the fire power. We’ve sent a couple of war wizards, but most of them are serving on the Tulan border. Gunpower weapons are a little too slow for this sort of thing, so we’re looking for people good with a bow. Quick enough to at least get a few shots off from a distance and run. Because hit and run tactics are what the Quillars excel at, so you’ll have to do likewise.”\n\nKosser pauses his talking for a moment. You take this opportunity to interject a question.\n\n“And this assignment you say has a lower mortality rate?”\n“Well, we haven’t sent as many people there yet, but so far we’ve made a little more progress there than at the Tulan border.

Would you believe that when I first joined up, the recruiter thought I didn’t know how? Sometimes these city folk got a lot of nerve making assumptions about people that grew up on farms, I’ve had to learn that first hand just by the folks I’m currently bunking with. They’re all mostly from the capitol or another Zalan city. I think I’m the only one here from a small village, so I’ve been saddled with the nickname “farmboy”. Ha ha.\n\nDespite this nick, I get along with most of the people here. The drill sergeant is mean, but luckily I haven’t had to suffer the full brunt of his wrath, which is more than can be said for a few of the people here. That’s never pretty.\n\nBoot camp is very tough. Even tougher than working on the farm. I’m just glad its half-way over. They took my lute away as soon as I entered. I really should’ve known better to take it with me…but I dunno I thought I’d be able to practice it on what few breaks I have. Oh well, I guess I wasn’t ever going to be that traveling bard anyway.

You figure you can take one personal belonging with you to Retlad as long as you keep them packed properly. You enter the store and with the little money you have you buy the lute. You spend the most of the day and the next practicing it. You didn’t forget as much as you thought. You also finish up writing a letter to your family and give it to a Zalan messenger carrier.\n\nFinally the third day arrives for you to move out. A couple of officers arrive to take most of your other fellow cadets. Mostly to the Tulan border, however, it would appear you have a different escort. A young man in loose robe approaches you. He looks like a wizard, but you wonder for how long since he seems about your age.\n\n“Hey, are you the one going to the Retlad Kingdom?” he asks\n“Yeah, who are you?”\n“I’m Wessel. And don’t you dare get cute and call me weasel, or I’ll have to blast you with a lightning bolt.”\n“I wasn’t planning on it.” You say which causes Wessel to start laughing.\n“Geez, I was just fucking with you. Don’t be so serious! So you ready to go?”\n“Yeah I guess, are you my superior officer?”\n“Huh? Oh no. Look I got our horses waiting outside; we can do all this getting to know you stuff on the way.”\n\nYou and Wessel get on the horses and ride towards your destination. It would appear that you’re the only one from your group to be going, but of course you were the only expert marksman.\n\nWessel begins to tell you more about why he’s with you. In fact he doesn’t really let you do much talking at all. He says he’s a native citizen of the Zalan Empire, but he just graduated from the esteemed magic university in the city state of Nuro. Wessel goes on to and says that when he heard they needed a few wizard over in Retlad, he decided to volunteer to test his skills and get paid while doing it. He explains that the pair of you will be following the orders of a Captain Vhalat.\n\nEveryone knows about Nuro. It’s very famous, and you always wondered what kind of magical wonders existed there, so you’re eager to hear more and he’s all too happy to tell you. Despite Wessel’s primary focus on himself, it sounds like a place you’d want to visit one day.\n\nEventually you arrive at the border and so far the Retlad Kingdom doesn’t look very well kept. The road begins to show evidence of disrepair and the sign posts are broken. You begin to keep your eye out for a possible attack at any second.\n\n“Look! Over there! It’s a village and it’s under attack! Come on!” Wessel yells and rides towards the village in the distance. You try to tell him to wait, but he’s already well on his way, so you ride after him.\n\nYou’ve never seen a Quillar before, but the closer you get to the village, you start seeing humanoid creatures covered in sharp spikes running around at a fast speed which could only be them. They are indeed fearsome looking. You also see a lot of the people running from them, and even a few people dressed in protective gear similar to yours…not that its doing them much good.\n\n“Alright you prickly bastards here’s something for ya!” Wessle shouts riding into the village with one hand raised in the air for a lightning blast attack. He shows no fear. You have no idea if all wizards are like this, but he’s either got to be brave, stupid or just suicidal. Of course he could be all three. Up until now you always thought wizards were supposed to be meek types that didn’t charge into battle and preferred to kill from afar. You guess you were wrong.\n","page 62":"If you’ve learned one thing, numbers doesn’t necessarily imply safety. With all the years of patrolling you’ve done along with your previous actions in Retlad so long ago, you actually feel more comfortable in smaller groups at this point. Your one and only rank and file battle didn’t go well.\n\nYour choice isn’t surprising, if anything more people feel comfortable with you scouting ahead.\n\nAs you journey further into former Tulan territory, you don’t encounter too much resistance. A few demons and crazed followers here and there, but nothing you can’t take care of. It also occurs to you how “planted” you’ve been for the past five years. While it’s true you did leave the fort a lot, you never ventured far from it. This is first time you’ve actually traveled. Ironic, since one of the reasons why you joined the army was the possibility of traveling to interesting places.\n\nHowever, it seems like you only visit these interesting places after they’re already destroyed. You’re basically seeing the aftermath of the demon occupation. It sort of reminds you of what you’d seen back in Retlad when the Quillars were killing folks except the landscape is in even worse condition. The demons weren’t content on just corrupting their mortal slaves; they were attempting to turn the entire land into their infernal realm. You can only imagine what sort of hell was going on while they were actually here.\n\nYou get to a small town that’s completely wrecked and seemingly deserted. Its night time and normally you’d go back and wait until morning to scout it, but Captain Eckard is insistent on getting to the former Tulan capital as quick as possible. You split up into small groups to scout the town quicker and tell everyone that if they come across anything more then they can handle, to run and alert everyone else.\n\nYou go building to building not really encountering much of anything. Not even survivors. Lots of half eaten dead bodies in various states of torment though. You expect when Velzix was killed the whole realm descended into anarchy pretty quickly and the demons reverted back to their chaotic natures causing as much mayhem as possible without too much repercussion.\n\nYou enter a shop with two of your other team members. You hear a creaking sound, which doesn’t sound good. One of your team members goes a little further in, and it gets louder.\n\n“Step back! The floors is…” you utter and then a large portion of the floor collapses underneath him. You attempt to grab his hand, but fail and the rest of the floor collapses underneath you as well.\n\nYou don’t fall too far, but you definitely feel it. You recover as quick as you can and hear your other subordinate who managed to avoid falling through the floor.\n\n“Sarge! Are you alright?” Private Ramusen shouts.\n“Yeah, yeah private. I’m just a little bruised.”\n“What about Gannon? Is he alright?”\n\nYou take your tinder box and make a small light. You look around and see that you must be in the basement of some sort of music shop from all the instruments you see. You didn’t even notice when you first entered the place, it just looked like any other ransacked shop.\n\nUpon further inspection you see a body lying on the floor. It’s Private Gannon and he’s dead. He didn’t land in the “good way” you did and broke his neck.\n\n“He’s dead.” You call up to Ramusen.\n“Shit! He’s fuckin’ dead?”\n“Yeah private, I just said he was! Now let me get the hell out of here…fuck! The damn stairs are completely destroyed. I can’t climb up, or even attempt a jump. Ramusen, throw down a rope and make sure you really secure it!”\n\nWhile you wait for Ramusen to complete this task, you take a look at some of the instruments. Lots of flutes and other wind instruments that don’t interest you. You grab an old looking mandolin. It’s definitely human design, but it seems very ornate though, must’ve been a specialty piece that wasn’t for sale.\n\nYou pluck at the strings and despite the dirt, grime, and neglect of the instrument; it still manages to produce a fairly pleasing tone. You play for a good five minutes before you realize that Ramusen hasn’t thrown down the rope yet.\n\n“Private?” is all you utter, when you hear the slumping of a lifeless body, followed by a low voice.\n\n“Beautiful…”\n\nYou grab your bow, when you see a dark figure loom above you. You fire, but miss due to the figure dodging quicker than anything you’ve ever encountered before. It doesn’t help that this same figure has jumped down the hole beside you before you can blink.\n\nYou’re standing right before the figure now. He has a pale, but familiar face, though the blood around the mouth is new and not encouraging. He knocks the bow out of your hand, but does nothing else to you. You wouldn’t be quick enough to draw your sword given what you’ve seen. In fact right now, all you’re feeling is fear.\n\n“Almost hit me…you would’ve made a good addition. Maybe you could’ve even…no. Nobody can. This world is lost now and soon my kind won’t even be around to guide your kind to combat the inevitable anymore…” Warnov says.\n“What…what are you talking about?” you ask unsure what’s going to happen next. Warnov looks as if he could tell you more than you’d ever want to know about lots of things, but instead he just shakes his head.\n\n“Nevermind human. Telling you the whole story would not help you anyway. Perhaps it’s best you hadn’t joined us, seeing as I have been marked now. It won’t be long before the rest of my kind are hunted down. He’s really quite pissed at us, and worse, he can sense us you see…(sigh) I can only imagine what he did to poor Count Rostov…”\n“Who’s pissed?”\n“Who do you think human? The Necro…I mean the Great Lich Lord of course. Oh yes. He’s back…and this one isn’t going to lose like the last one did so long ago.”\n\nYou’re not following all of Warnov’s cryptic speak, but if the last bit he’s said is true, he’s scared the hell out of you more than he has with his actions. Warnov grabs your shoulder and looks into your eyes.\n\n“I do not envy your fate human…the extinction of your species will soon follow my own. My advice to you? Live human! Live while you can, for eventually this whole world will be dead and under his complete control.”\n\nSensing that he’s brought enough doom and gloom to you, he relents and steps back.\n\n“Play me a song human.” He says catching you off guard.\n“…what did you want to hear?” you ask shakily.\n“I don’t know…anything. Play what you were playing before.”\n\nYou slowly pick up the dropped mandolin and begin playing the song that you were playing before and you play as if your life depended on it, though you get the impression that Warnov has no intention on killing you.\n\nHe sits quietly listening in the darkness, after finishing the song; he leaps back up through the hole.\n\n“Beautiful…such talent…such a waste…”\n\nA rope is thrown down and the sounds of feet running off are then heard. You wait a minute and then climb up the rope, taking the mandolin with you. You see private Ramusen lying nearby with his throat ripped out and thoroughly drained of blood.\n\nYou’re also just in time to hear other members of your group coming to your position when you exit the shop.\n\nWhat the hell are you supposed to tell them? Death to the world, reborn lich lords…you start thinking, what’s the point of all this? Maybe Warnov was right, maybe you should LIVE while there’s still time. Granted his information is spotty, but you can’t help but thinking he’s probably more informed on the situation than most people.\n\nYou’ve pondered it several times before, and you’ve even attempted it once, but deserting is looking very desirable again. In this day and age, who’s going to know if were killed or not?\n","page 61":"If its undead you’re going to face you decide you don’t want to get caught fighting them with only a few men to help you. Captain Eckard is a little surprised by your decision, but chooses a few others to be the reconnaissance group.\n\nYour replacements aren’t as good as you might’ve been however. Many times they fuck up and miss a few demon bands that were fleeing from the Tulan Kingdom and ambushing whoever passed by. It’s not too bad at first, but the closer you get to the capital, the more powerful these little groups are. The losses get more severe, but Captain Eckard insists on continuing.\n\nBy the time you get to the capital during most of the citizens there have been so corrupted or beat down by the demons at this point that they’ve either sold their own souls to Hell or gone completely mad. You’re attacked by them and a few of the demon hold outs. Your own ranks have been severely weakened by this point.\n\nIt’s during an ambush that you’re suddenly hit by a fireball from a flame demon who was sitting on top of a nearby rooftop. You run around screaming and trying to put out the flames, but a couple of flying imps throw spears into your back ensuring that you lie still as you finish burning to death.\n","page 64":"Dear Mom,\n\nI meant to tell you this weird man from Zalan Intelligence offered me a job, a few months ago. Said I could be a “real” hero and a bunch of other stuff. Part of it sounded appealing, but something about him made me feel really uncomfortable.\n\nI wonder if I’m just avoiding my “potential.” Like perhaps I am supposed to be some great general or warrior, or whatever. But I just don’t feel that desire within me. Now if I had been offered to give up all this army stuff and play at the Emperor’s Palace as a regular job then I might’ve accepted!\n\nOver these years as I’ve played for others and mainly for myself, I truly believe I really was meant to play music in this world. Just events didn’t work out for me I guess, but even within this situation, I’ve still found a way to indulge in my passion and I suppose it’s better than never being able to at all.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps one day all of this will be over and I’ll come out of this alive and manage to pursue music without hindrance.\n\nI know that sounds a little uncharacteristically optimistic from me, but I guess I still have a little hope left after all.\n\nGive my love to the rest of the family\n\nYour son\n","page 63":"Hey Mallack!\n\nThis letter is directly for you again. Glad you’ve been keeping these between us.\n\nAnyway, I know it seemed silly to worry about a girl I just had a brief encounter with years ago for one night. But when I heard about the Brot Kingdom being destroyed by the Necromancer, I did wonder about Helena.\n\nWell, I found out she’s still alive! She stopped off in Fort Virtue not too long ago! She wasn’t in Brot when all that shit went down. She was trading in the Azi Republic at the time.\n\nWhen she arrived in Fort Virtue to trade, I recognized her and she seemed pleased to see me. She mentioned that she was pleased to see a familiar face for once and we spent a lot of time together for as long as she stayed. (And yes, we did THAT several times too.)\n\nI wish things were different, or at least not the way they are right now. I definitely would want to pursue a more permanent relationship with her because we get along really well, but alas that’s not to be. At least not at this time.\n\nShe told me she was heading to the Retlad Kingdom next; I hope she stays there because there’s less fighting going on. Definitely no more Quillars there anymore. I dunno, I know it’s minor and doesn’t really make sense, but this little bit of info sort of put me in a better mood. I guess I’ll be writing Mom a more upbeat letter as well soon.\n\nOkay, well I hope everything’s going good with you too. Keep watching out for the Kobolds and keep ‘em out of that chicken coop!\n\nYour brother\n","page 0":"This is no way to live.\n\nWorking on a barely profitable rundown farm with far too many family members to feed. It’s a damn good thing you’re an excellent hunter. However, lately there’s even been a shortage of game to thwart your efforts.\n\nYou didn’t really want to be working on the farm your whole life in the first place, you wanted to see the world but when dad died, things got a lot harder for the family and you had to take over as “man” of the house and stay put.\n\nSomething is going to have to change.\n\nWhile you’d like nothing more than to go through with your childhood dreams of becoming a traveling bard without any responsibility you don’t have that luxury. Hell, you barely have time to play your lute anymore in the small amount of free time you do have. You doubt if you’d even be good enough to make a living for just yourself doing it.\n\nBut you need to get away, but what can you do that won’t allow you to completely abandon your mom and all your brothers and sisters?\n\nYou suddenly think of the choice that many in your desperate position have thought of many times before.\n\nThe army.\n\nIts not exactly ideal, but you be traveling and seeing the world so to speak. You’d also be making enough money that you could send to your family. Your own living expenses would be provided for by the army.\n\nOf course there’s all that fighting that usually goes along with it that you’re not to keen on. Not that you aren’t a stranger to battle as their have been the occasional bandits or kobold thieves that have attempted to steal from the farm in the past, but you prefer not to fight if possible, especially not up close. The bow has always been your weapon of choice. There’s also the matter of mass combat on a grand scale that usually accompanies army life. A lot different than chasing away some thieves in the chicken coop.\n\nAs you’re thinking about this, you also realize that there is another option. There’s a small mercenary company passing through the area. They’ve been hanging out at the local tavern for a couple days. They don’t seem to be the noblest sort from what you can tell, but fortunately they seem to have kept their revelry confined to the tavern. Who knows how they act away from “civilization” though.\n\nStill, it’s something to consider. There probably is less attention to discipline and a little more relaxed on rules and regulations. You probably wouldn’t be fighting in some mass land war that governments are fond of waging. Mercenaries travel a lot and tend to make more, however they tend to get hired for a lot weirder jobs, usually ones that the employer doesn’t want people to know about or ones that nobody else seems to be able to handle.\n"}
