["76","Repression","EndMaster","4","7","5.87","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/Repression.aspx","Emotions can be wonderful or dangerous...\nAdditional Notes:\nThis story has a few bits that are probably a bit on the disturbing side. Not many, but they are there in places. So if you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you probably shouldn\u0027t read it.\nThis story in general is probably a bit odd and less verbose than most of my other stories. There are also several endings varying in degrees of good/bad/neutral outcomes. While there are some endings better than others, this is basically just the tale of a teenager who definitely has some issues."]
