The natural progression of your relationship with her. You\u0027ve always felt that you had a special connection with her, you\u0027re her balancer, her anchor if you will. That\u0027s why you were so repressed, you felt these emotions were wrong, but now you realize that was just society\u0027s rules being forced on you and its apparent that your sister had felt the same way, why else would she put herself in abusive relationships on purpose?

At home its a living hell. You argue with Mom as much as your sister does now, but nobody gets kicked out.

Its all too much for you. You decline her offer and continue to just observe.\n\nPretty soon, you see your sister stumbling around, she\u0027s not drunk enough to pass out, but she is drunk enough to be acting like an idiot. You notice other guys attempting to take advantage of this fact, you step in, and start escorting her out. When you get outside, you half expect her to start yelling at you for ruining her fun, but she doesn\u0027t. Instead she starts getting all weepy.

She\u0027s pissed and iching for a fight. Normally her tirades would effect you more, but not after what you\u0027ve been through. You\u0027re tired of her ordering everyone around, she has no idea how to REALLY look out for someone. If she did, your sister wouldn\u0027t be the mess she is.\n\nYou put your sister on the sofa, and yell at your Mom telling her she needs to stop acting like a fucking dictator and to start acting like a mother, because she\u0027s going to drive away the both of you if she keeps this up.\n\nYour words seem to have somewhat of an effect. Your Mom still doesn\u0027t want to admit defeat though, she says you\u0027re ALL going to talk about this tomorrow. You\u0027re tired, and don\u0027t want to argue anymore tonight, so you agree.\n\nYou head up to bed, realizing that your actions today have worn you out! Being a defender isn\u0027t easy.

She wakes you up with a kiss. Her loneliness for physical pleasure is too great and her love for you is too strong. This feels so right to you. You realize why the girls at school never \"did it\" for you, it was always Mom you lusted for, you\u0027ve always known, and now its all coming true. She begins to mount you and guides your hands all over her body. She is your teacher, she is your master, she is your life.\n\nYou and Mom spend a night of hot taboo passion as your virgin seed enters the very womb that bore you.

You thought you understood...but it was all just a fantasy that YOU made up in your twisted mind. Your mother never hinted that she had any interest in you in that way! Even her kiss was just a peck on the lips. Nothing more, but you turned it into something else, along with everything else she did.\n\nYou feel betrayed, you did everything she ever said, only to find out she doesn\u0027t love you afterall.

Finally she drags you out of the bed and onto the floor...\n\nYou\u0027re totally catatonic.\n\nYour mom screams for your sister to help her, and some confusion occurs. You are completely still from the time, the ambulance come to pick you up, to the time you\u0027re put in the catatonia ward.\n\nAs you remain in your cell, you feel something. Freedom. Its ironic, in this place of walls and bars, and your catatonic state, you finally feel free.

You\u0027ve always known her to be a hard tough woman, its a little shocking to see this side of her.\n\nShe notices you and quickly wipes her eyes and reverts back to her old self.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here?! Get the fuck to school!!\"\n","page 2":"You don\u0027t get up. Today is different somehow. You don\u0027t know why, but it is.\n\nYour mother is screaming at you to come down.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t even faze you. Her threats meaning nothing anymore.\n\nYou hear her coming up the stairs.\n","page 149":"You wait patiently because you were told to do so. Something about realizing that makes you a lot calmer.\n\nYour sister returns with \"body disposing\" items. She says you could either chop her up in the bathtub and then dispose of her in garbage bags or just wait until night and bury her in the backyard.\n\nIt almost looks as if your sister had thought about doing it herself at one time. You hadn\u0027t even planned it out that far. You tell your sister whatever she thinks is best, but you\u0027ll carry it out whatever she decides.\n\nAfter she makes her decision, you go about performing the duty casually. Its almost as if you feel like yourself again. Later your sister makes up an elaborate story about your Mom\u0027s disappearance, you back her up without any problems and it is believed.\n\nLife continues as normal for the both of you, sis feels complete freedom to do what she wants and you take care of the more mundane matters that she tells you to do when she doesn\u0027t feel like bothering to do them (Which is all the time)\n\nYou now know why you felt fear and panic after you killed your Mom. It was because after so many years of being told what to do you\u0027d destroyed your shackles. Freedom can be frightening and you realized it wasn\u0027t for you. Thank god sis has taken over Mom\u0027s role now. Its not exactly the same, but its calmer and secure.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel safe...\n","page 1":"You head downstairs, like you always do. No point in breaking tradition.\n\nWhen you get downstairs your Mom is arguing with your 17 year old sister as usual. She isn\u0027t like you at all, she\u0027s popular for one thing, but then again being a very pretty and extroverted will do that for a person.\n\nShe\u0027s a bit of a wild child though which your domineering mother can\u0027t stand. You wonder why your sister acts the way she does, Mom\u0027s just trying to look out for her.\n\nThey\u0027re really arguing today.\n","page 148":"You totally lose it! You know your sister went to go get the cops! They\u0027re probably on their way here right now! You run like a mad man down the street until you pass out from hyperventilation.\n\nWhen you wake up, your sister is standing over you, scolding you for running off like that. You were fortunate that she saw you lying face first on the sidewalk. This doesn\u0027t reassure you though and you continue to gibber about being caught. Your sister gets irritated by your behavior and ends up having to dispose of the body herself. Later a story is made up that your Mom just up and left and never came back, unfortunately your constant nevousness give you away and you blab everything.\n\nBoth of you get charged, but since your sister never actually killed anyone, she get a lesser sentence. You feel completely relieved by all this even though you\u0027re going to jail for life. The fear and panic have left you, and have been replaced by a welcomed numbness again.\n\nAnother day arrives in your cell and you feel nothing...\n","page 4":"You know Mom\u0027s just looking out for the best interest of your sister, and you say as much. Your Mom looks a little surprised as does your sister, who then gets really angry.\n\n\"Fuck the both of you! You don\u0027t know me! You\u0027re a fucking cold hearted bitch who\u0027s wallowing in her own loneliness and you\u0027re her fucking lap dog who does everything she says!\" you sister screams.\n\n\"Maybe because he actually cares about my feelings! Unlike you, you little slut!\" your Mom says and then slaps her. Your sister looks like she might attempt to slap your Mom back, but your presence stops her. Instead she runs out the door, with one last comment.\n\n“I’m leaving this fucking house of insanity! The both of you two can go straight to hell!” she says slamming the door.\n\nYour Mom waves her hand in disgust and then turns to you.\n\n“Thanks for taking my side. You’re such a good son.” She says and then hugs you, you return the gesture.\n\n“Okay now head off to school, I have to go to work.”\n","page 3":"You sit and eat your breakfast quietly while the two argue as usual. It doesn\u0027t involve you, so why get into it?\n\n\"You little fucking whore! You keep staying out all night, and you can just forget about living under my roof! Go fucking sleep in the street with the rest of the sluts!\"\n\n\"Oh go fuck yourself Mom! You\u0027re just mad because you\u0027re a fucking bitter old harpy with nobody in your fucking life!\"\n\"Why you fucking little bitch!\" your Mom says and slaps your sister across the face.\n\nYour sister holds her face and shuts up. She picks up her school stuff and heads toward the door, before exiting she says one last thing, before slamming the door.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry Mom, I\u0027m not staying in this fucking house another day!\"\n\nYou finish up your breakfast, your Mom doesn\u0027t even acknowledge you\u0027re there, she leaves the kitchen in a huff rather quickly.\n\nShe must be really pissed.\n","page 11":"Under different circumstances, this might have worked, but your cold emotionless demeanor is still very much a part of you. When you approach Jessica to help her, she declines and gives you a funny look.\n\nYou go back to doing what you were doing. In fact you go about your usual routine for the rest of the day. The fact Jessica turned you down, seems to only make you supress your feelings and retreat into your own world even more. Eventually you go home and go to bed.\n\nAnother day arrives and you still feel nothing...\n","page 99":"You muster up all your inner strength and introduce Jessica to Mom.\n\nMom is surprisingly cordial. You don\u0027t get it, you thought she\u0027d be mad. Maybe she realized that what she wanted to pursue with you was wrong, and is glad you found someone to be with in a healthy relationship. Your nervousness decreases almost completely. Your Mom leaves you and Jessica alone, your previous niceness to her has put her in a good enough mood to let you have some fun, especially since you don\u0027t cause much trouble.\n\nEventually you take Jessica home, and despite having a rather strange first date, she agrees to see you tomorrow and you promise to really take her somewhere.\n\nYou go home thinking about today\u0027s events. You still have a great deal of devotion to your Mom, but are glad it wasn\u0027t taken to THAT level. You wonder though, Jessica looks a lot like your Mom when she was younger. Is that why you were attracted to her?\n\nYou don\u0027t want to dwell on that too much! You go to bed.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel slightly warped...\n","page 10":"She\u0027s never made any effort to talk to you, so you don\u0027t feel the overwhelming need to talk to her. You continue with your work until that class is over.\n\nLunch time comes around, you expect Aaron to come sit next to you, but he\u0027s nowhere to be seen. You wonder if Henry beat him up so bad he had to go home.\n\nAs you sit by yourself eating quietly, you overhear Butch at the next table.\n\n\"Yeah that fucking bitch sucked my dick last night! Haw Haw!\"\n\nButch is your sister\u0027s jock boyfriend, even though they\u0027re constantly breaking up and making up. The break ups are mainly due to him cheating on her all the time, but she always ends up forgiving him. You don\u0027t know why, even you think your sister could do way better.\n\nRight now Butch is bragging to his buddies about his latest conquest, which apparently wasn\u0027t your sister.\n","page 13":"Probably not the best time to act on your feelings...\n\nYou suddenly feel the need to defend your sister\u0027s honor by confronting Butch and his six football playing buddies. Needless to say, you don\u0027t win that confrontation.\n\nFor the most part you\u0027re more humilated than beaten beyond recognition. Still, its enough to deter you from displaying emotion ever again, you go back to your low profile emotionless lifestyle. Things are just easier that way for you.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel nothing...\n","page 12":"Your sister is aware of Butch\u0027s infidelity, its up to her to leave him. What good would it do to confront him? After all it isn\u0027t really your concern.\n\nYou finish eating and head back to class. On your way there, you pass Henry. Normally Henry doesn\u0027t bother with you, save the occasional name calling, but he\u0027s looking for a fight.\n\n\"Hey dickhead! I saw you looking at me kicking that faggot Aaron\u0027s ass! I know you two fucking butt boys hang out, aren\u0027t you pissed off that I kicked your boyfriend\u0027s ass?\" Henry says getting in your face and pushing you.\n","page 15":"When Henry pushes you, you look confused at first, but then your expression turns to anger. Then your emotions soon follow...\n\nYou punch Henry straight in the nose causing it to explode in a gout of blood! Henry screams when he sees all that blood gushing from his nose. You don\u0027t just stop there though, you then take his pinky finger and break it. At this point you are drawing a crowd, while some others go to fetch a teacher.\n\nYou slam Henry\u0027s head into the hard ground until his skull cracks. Henry\u0027s already unconscious at this point, but you continue to kick him in the stomach until a teacher finally pulls you off, at which point to go quietly.\n\nThis act of wild unleashed anger gets you in severe trouble, namely prison for attempted murder. You don\u0027t seem to mind though, Its a structured environment that you\u0027re used to, and you welcome the chance to unleash your endless pent up anger on your fellow inmates.\n\nAnother day arrives in your cell you feel fury...\n","page 9":"Sometimes attempting to do something positive doesn\u0027t work out.\n\nYou attempt to tell Henry to leave Aaron alone, but that doesn\u0027t help you. Henry just gets mad and attacks you instead. His anger for you interfering results in him beating you very badly. In fact you don\u0027t survive.\n\nOne last breath and then you feel nothing...\n","page 14":"You step aside and walk around him. Henry\u0027s a little surprised.\n\n\"Hey faggot, I\u0027m talking to you bitch!\" he shouts as you continue to ignore him. Henry hits you in the back of the head with a thrown pencil which you continue to ignore. Sensing his actions aren\u0027t getting the desired effect, he stops harassing you.\n\"Fuck this creepy faggot.\" Henry mutters to himself and goes in search of different prey.\n\nYou attend the last of your classes and then leave the school. You run into your sister outside. She walks up to talk to you.\n\n\"Hey, I\u0027m gonna stay with Butch tonight, and I think I might just stay over there permanently, his parents all cool enough to let me stay there. I\u0027ll be moving all my stuff out a little bit at a time, but I\u0027ll try to be quick, so you can tell that controlling bitch that she won\u0027t have to deal with me anymore.\"\n\nWow, your sister wasn\u0027t joking about moving out.\n","page 17":"You nod and say okay unemotionally. Your sister looks at you a little worried.\n\n\"You know, you should get out of that house too. I mean look at what Mom has done to you. You\u0027re a fucking emotionless robot! You just do everything Mom tells you. Is that really how you want to go through life?\"\n\nYou don\u0027t say anything.\n\n\"Look, take care of yourself and remember that you don\u0027t need to do everything that Mom says.\"\n\nShe hugs you goodbye and leaves.\n\nYou head back home and when Mom comes back home from work you explain what happened to your sister. Your Mom looks angry, but also relieved, almost as if having her out of the house is a blessing.\n\n\"Good, that little disobedient bitch can stay gone then. Well what are you doing still standing around for? You know you have work to do around the house!\"\n","page 16":"Your detached answer, only causes Henry to believe that you\u0027re smarting off to him. He immediately kicks you in the balls and trust me you DO feel that!\n\nHe then drags you into the bathroom and beats the hell out of you and leaves you for dead. As you struggle to get your head out of the toilet you lose consciousness due to the massive gash in your head that\u0027s bleeding profusely.\n\nLater you\u0027re found by the janitor who manages to get you to a hospital just in time for you to live. Not in time for you to have not suffered brain damage though.\n\nOddly this has an interesting effect on your previous emotional condition. You revert back to a childlike state. Your Mom actually is nicer to you and in general, and sis seems to stop partying as much. Your unfortunate event has inadvertantly brought them closer to each other and to you. Of course you\u0027re unaware of such things, you just know that two pretty ladies take care of you.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel playful...\n","page 91":"As you obey Mom, your budding emotions seem to shrink back again. Maybe it was just a fluke that you acted like you did, because you certainly don\u0027t display any follow up feelings towards Mom or anyone else the entire day.\n\nYour day follows as unemotional as usual until you go home and go to bed.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel nothing...\n","page 92":"Your Mom again looks surprised, but also a little happy.\n\n\"Well okay, its on my way to work. Are you sure you want me too though? Won\u0027t it embarass you in front of your friends?\"\n\nMom sure doesn\u0027t know you very well at all. You don\u0027t really have any. Of course even if you did, you wouldn\u0027t care.\n\nYour Mom drives you to school just like you remember she used to when you were little. She always seemed a lot happier back then. She almost looks that happy again right now.\n\nAs she drops you off, she lets you out, but before she does, she kisses you goodbye...on the lips.\n\nAs she drives off, you\u0027re left feeling a little strange. You\u0027ve never been very emotional, but something in you has changed. You head to your classes a little preoccupied, until Jessica comes up to you in computer class.\n\n\"Hey, can you help me with this?\" she asks.\n","page 95":"You barely acknowledge Jessica\u0027s presence. She\u0027s one of your sister\u0027s friends anyway, which makes you even less inclined to help her. You say something about being really busy and having a lot to do on your own computer right now. As Jessica leaves, you continue to think about Mom, and that kiss.\n\nLunch time comes around and you sit to ponder it even more, fortunately without your idiot \"friend\" Aaron buzzing in your ear. You hear your sister\u0027s boyfriend Butch bragging at the next table about some chick he slept with last night, that apparently wasn\u0027t your sister. This is why your sister SHOULD listen to Mom! She knows what\u0027s best, and knows how to protect you from bad people.\n\nLunch ends and you attend the rest of your classes without incident. Finally after school lets out, you run into your sister. She sees you, but refuses to talk to you.\n","page 94":"You kind of don\u0027t want to think about your Mom kissing you the way she did. It makes you uncomfortable. You take the opportunity to help Jessica to take your mind off of things.\n\nAs you help Jessica, she thanks you and becomes more friendly. She says she\u0027s always wondered about you, since you\u0027re very different than your sister who she\u0027s friends with. You open up a bit more than you normally would probably because you\u0027re still trying to get your mind off of Mom.\n\nIts probably what makes you blurt out asking Jessica for a date after school. Jessica\u0027s a little surprised, but accepts.\n\nWhen the class ends you realize you\u0027ve just recieved a date with the one girl who seemed to stir some emotions in you. You begin to shake and rush to the bathroom to throw up. This is all a lot to take in. Your Mom kissed you on the lips and now you have a date with the girl of your dreams for all intense and purposes. You don\u0027t feel very hungry so you spend your lunch hour working on something for another class.\n\nYou attend the rest of your classes and eventually school comes to an end, and Jessica meets you outside.\n\nYour emotions are all mixed up and your mind is going a mile a minute.\n","page 97":"You want to avoid Mom for as long as possible! You take Jessica to the movies.\n\nYou and Jessica get some food and sit to watch the film. You can\u0027t seem to relax. You\u0027re still anxious and nervous about going home. You begin not to feel well again. Just as Jessica asks you what\u0027s wrong, you puke up popcorn and gummy bears all over her.\n\n\"EWWWWWWWW!\" she screams and runs out of the theatre.\n\nNot really knowing what to do next you head home, still worrying over what Mom is going to do. When you get home, Mom sees you and starts screaming. She asks where the hell you\u0027ve been. You say the movies, to which she screams at you some more for saying you never told her you were going there and you need to check in with her first. You\u0027ll be getting kicked out of the house like your sister, if you feel the need to disobey the rules she continues to say.\n\nThis seems like the Mom you know and are comfortable with! You guess you were mistaken about Mom\u0027s feelings towards you and that relieves you. You don\u0027t feel as nervous now, it reverts back into that familar numb feeling again. You decide that acting out of your normal routine was a great risk that nearly drove you over the edge. You won\u0027t be doing that again.\n\nAnother day arrives and once again you feel nothing...\n","page 96":"You tell her you want her to meet your Mom. You still got her on your mind. You have to show her that what she wants can\u0027t occur! And by bringing Jessica home, you\u0027ll be able to show that. Of course you\u0027re really nervous about what\u0027s going to happen. You barely manage to keep yourself from throwing up again.\n\nJessica meanwhile is a little puzzled by your choice of \"date\" but agrees. You get home and you and Jessica talk for a little while longer getting to know each other better, but still in the back of your head you worry about Mom.\n\nThen she arrives. And she looks really surprised to see you with a girl in the house. Speechless in fact.\n","page 29":"You ignore her abuse, you now know her lashing out is merely a reflection of her own unhappiness. You continue to ask what\u0027s wrong and that you\u0027re only here to help.\n\nYour genuine concern and her vulnerable state seems to cause her to open up a bit. She breaks down and says how, she\u0027s sorry for failing as a parent, and how she\u0027s losing your sister, and she doesn\u0027t want to lose you either.\n\nYou tell her if perhaps she was less controling, things might be better. You say you\u0027ll see what you can do about sis. Your Mom thanks you and after a few more hugs and reassurances, you rush off to school. On your way there, your emotions are a little less surpressed. You feel like you have a goal to accomplish now.\n\nYou get to school a little late, which results in you getting sent to the principal\u0027s office where you run into Henry, the school bully. He\u0027s there for beating someone up as usual. He gives you a dirty look and the finger.\n","page 20":"You tell her no.\n\nShe slaps you. \"What was that?\"\n\nYou don\u0027t make anymore trouble, and do what you\u0027re told. Your sister\u0027s advice only got you punished, and what has her rebellious nature gotten her? She\u0027s been kicked out of the house. No, rules are made to be followed. To disobey invites punishment. You go to bed remembering that fact of life.\n\nAnother day arrives, and you feel nothing...\n","page 0":"Its another day and you feel nothing...\n\nYou\u0027re 18 years old and very socially inept. Naturally you\u0027re not popular in high school, you\u0027re not even worthy to be routinely picked on. This isn\u0027t to say you aren\u0027t at all, but most people just find you very creepy and stay away from you. You\u0027re mom\u0027s strict upbringing has made you very emotionally detached and repressed. At this point you barely feel any kind of emotions at all.\n\nMaybe that changes today.\n\nYour Mom is calling you down to eat.\n","page 141":"You\u0027re still too scared, you go out the window and try to climb down, unfortunately your panic prevents you from climbing as efficiently as you\u0027d like.\n\nYou fall off and impale yourself through the chest on the fence surrounding Mom\u0027s rose bushes. You gasp for breath, coughing up blood. You feel fear overwhelm you as you approach death.\n\nThen you feel nothing...\n","page 140":"You stop to listen to your sister, you\u0027re still scared and panicked, but she\u0027s never caused you harm.\n\n\"Its okay I understand, you just couldn\u0027t take it anymore. Look what she did to you...okay, I know what to do. You just have to stay calm for me okay?\" she says.\n\nYou shake and tremble, but you nod your head. She tells you she\u0027s going to leave for a little while, but she\u0027ll be back. You don\u0027t want her to go, but she says she has to, if she\u0027s going to help. You reluctantly agree.\n\nAfter sis leaves, its just you alone in the house with Mom\u0027s dead body.\n","page 143":"You don\u0027t even want to look at it, let alone touch it. Besides sis told you everything would be okay if you just stayed calm. You downstairs to watch TV, but you start to worry about where your sister is at.

What if some insistant vaccum salesman knocks on the door and demands to demonstrate his product? Or maybe someone checking for Radon levels in the house?\n\nYou have to hide the body!\n\nYou pick Mom up, trying to figure out where to put her. You decide your closet, unfortunately your closet is full of crap, so you attempt to stuff her in there throwing your entire body into it. As you begin to breathe hard, you catch the fragrence of the perfume still lingering on her body, you notice her dress has been lifted up as you\u0027ve been attempting to shove her in your closet. You\u0027re aroused as you also notice you\u0027re positioned between her legs, you begin to have BAD thoughts as you stroke her thighs.\n\nYou can\u0027t stop yourself...\n\nDuring this completely immoral act, you don\u0027t feel panic anymore, you feel power. Total power. All that shit she did to you, you\u0027re returning in kind. Now YOU have the power over her. You feel so fuckin\u0027 alive!\n\nAs you finish up, you hear your sister come back home.\n","page 33":"Exposing your sister\u0027s cheating cad of a boyfriend was the right direction, but you definitely went the WRONG way about it.\n\nButch and his friends laugh at your attempt to convince him to confess to your sister or you\u0027ll do it.\n\nThey beat you and humilate you, then run off laughing. In a cruel twist you get sent to the principal\u0027s office again where he\u0027s less flexible. He assumes you\u0027re a trouble maker and suspends you effective immediately. You don\u0027t get a chance to talk to your sister, she and Butch take off early for some party. When your Mom gets home, your sister\u0027s run away event and your suspension put your Mom back in her usual hard ass mood.

You know you can patch your family up and make it functional rather than dysfunctional, you just have to figure out how to do it.\n\nIn the meantime the secretary tells you that the principal is going to be with Henry for a long time and since you\u0027re a fairly good student who never causes trouble, she says you can leave with a warning.\n\nYou go to lunch, still trying to figure out how to fix your family when over at the table behind you, you hear your sister\u0027s boyfriend Butch bragging to his friends about some girl he slept with who wasn\u0027t your sister.\n","page 35":"You all sit at the table, staring at each other. You\u0027re acting as a mediator. Mom and sis start out calmly, but it quickly escalates into name calling and criticism. The usual insults. You put a stop to it and demand that they get along!

You remind them of the good times that you all have had at one time. Good times that have occurred much too rarely and much too long ago.\n\nYou tell them you think that\u0027s why you shut down emotionally, because it was just easier to deal with the pain of seeing two people you care for in your life grow to hate each other so much. You say how you just want all of them to be a family again. You begin to weep.\n\nYour speech is probably the most emotional thing either of them has heard from you in years.

After all family is the most important thing.\n\nAnother day arrives, you wake up beside your sister and Mom and you feel complete euphoria...\n","page 31":"That routine might work on those close to you, but not on anti-social miscreants who hate your guts!\n\nAs you attempt to ask why Henry feels the need to be hostile to everyone, his expression turns to repulsion. He thinks you\u0027re hitting on him.\n\n\"What the fuck are you, some fucking faggot or something?\" he says and then attacks you right in the principal\u0027s office! He beats you pretty bad before the principal manages to get him off of you. You end up having to go to the hospital.\n\nYour sister and Mom come to visit you and they get into an even bigger arguement resulting in a physical fight. Any goal you had of trying to patch up your family has been shattered forever. You don\u0027t seem to care anymore though, you realize playing peacemaker was a fool\u0027s quest anyway. Look what it got you. You fall asleep keeping that thought in mind.\n\nYou wake up the next day in your hospital bed and you feel nothing...\n","page 30":"You obey and go to school. There was a real opportunity to change things here, but you failed to take advantage.\n\nThe rest of your day pretty much follows the same pattern until you come home and go to bed.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel nothing...\n","page 46":"You leave Aaron to his fate. Your emotions have become dead again. You just don\u0027t care anymore. What happened at the house was just an usual oddity in your \"normal\" behavior you guess.\n\nYou go through your day numb as usual, when you get home, Mom reads you the riot act for this morning. This only makes you realize that speaking out against her wasn\u0027t a good idea in the first place. You go to bed.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel nothing...\n","page 45":"You step up to Henry.\n\"What the fuck do you want faggot?\" he demands.\n\nYou don\u0027t even answer, you just punch Henry. Henry punches you back! Any other time you might run away, but this is different! Somehow when you stood up to Mom today, you feel a lot more confident! You and Henry begin to wrestle in the hallway, until a teacher breaks you up. Normally you\u0027d get sent to the principal\u0027s office, but the teacher just yells at you instead. Aaron thanks you profusely and states how he\u0027ll do all your homework for you.\n\nYour sense of accomplishment grows. You like being praised for your deeds.\n\nWhen you get to your computer class, you notice that your sister\u0027s friend Jessica, is having problems with today\u0027s lesson.\n","page 48":"Jessica didn\u0027t ask for your help, and you don\u0027t want to make an annoyance of yourself, so you go to your seat and quietly do your work.\n\nSoon, Jessica comes up to you and asks you for your help, since she knows you\u0027re good with computers. You\u0027re glad to lend her a hand. You\u0027ve always liked her to some degree even if you never showed it. Now you have the perfect opportunity to do so.\n\nAs you explain things to her you get the feeling she no longer thinks of you as your sister\u0027s \"creepy\" brother anymore. She really welcomes your help.\n\nClass ends and your confidence increases. You think you might even ask Jessica out tomorrow!\n\nLunchtime comes around and Aaron sits next to you as he normally does. He continues to thank you for what you did earlier. He says you\u0027ve inspired him a bit.\n\nMeanwhile you happen to over hear your sister\u0027s boyfriend Butch, who\u0027s bragging about his sexual exploits to his friends.\n\n\"Yeah I fucked that bitch straight in the fucking ass last night! Haw Haw!\"\n\nYou\u0027re about to get up to defend your sister\u0027s honor, but suddenly you realize he\u0027s talking about a completely different girl. It appears Butch has been cheating on your sister again.\n","page 47":"You go up to Jessica and explain what she\u0027s doing wrong and how she NEEDS to be doing it. You proceed to take completely over.\n\nWhile Jessica wouldn\u0027t have minded your help, she doesn\u0027t particularly care for how you approached her. She didn\u0027t ASK you for your help and your arrogant manner has turned her off. And the fact you told her that she may \"thank you now\" made things even worse.\n\nYou\u0027ve lost your shot at her, but that doesn\u0027t seem to bother you, the fact that she didn\u0027t praise the ground you walk on for your help, bothers you more. Some people are just ungrateful you guess.\n\nLunchtime comes around and Aaron begins thanking you again, for helping him. You enjoy his praise until you tire of him and tell him to shut up and get you another can of Coke, which he complies.\n\nAt this point you overhear your sister\u0027s boyfriend Butch brag to all his friends about some girl he slept with last night. A girl that wasn\u0027t your sister.\n\nYou wonder if you should confront him, but you don\u0027t see how this could be readily advantageous to you.\n","page 49":"Your sister has been getting fucked around by this guy for too long. He constantly cheats on her and she always takes him back. Well it stops today, because YOU know what\u0027s best for her.\n\nYou immediately confront Butch, he turns around wondering what you want, and you tell him to stay away from your sister. He laughs in your face and tells you to fuck off. This once again prompts you to resort to violence.\n\nYou punch Butch in the face, but the guy\u0027s a jock, he can easily withstand anything you can dish out. Not to mention he\u0027s got six of his buddies to help him.\n\nThey beat the hell out of you and throw you in the Cafeteria garbage can, and take off laughing before an authority figure catches them.\nYou get sent to the principal\u0027s office for getting into your second fight today!\n\nAfter getting suspended for the next three days, you run into your sister outside of school who walks up to you pissed as hell.\n\n\"What the fuck did you think you were doing picking a fight with Butch?!\"\n\nYou attempt to explain, but she\u0027s not listening.\n\n\"He stopped doing that! He loves me! You\u0027re just trying to control my life! I heard about how you acted towards Jessica today. You\u0027re trying to dominate everything just like Mom!\"\n\nAt this point you get enraged with her, for not showing you the gratitude that you deserve! You tried to help her out and this is how she repays you?\nYou slap the shit out of her! She holds her face, hits you back and runs off crying, stating how she\u0027s moving out of the house.\n\nGood, you think, if she doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s good for her, she can get the fuck out.\n\nYou head back home and do what the hell you want, until that bitch you call Mom comes home. She immediately starts her shit.\n\n\"Don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t forgot about that shit you pulled this morning!\" she begins saying.\n","page 100":"You suddenly lose it. You beg for Mom\u0027s forgiveness. Your devotion to your Mom is too great and if she wants you as a lover as well then you\u0027ll comply.\n\nYou say all this while groveling at her feet weeping. Jessica AND your Mom look at each other and then slowly back away from you.\n\nYou look up, and see Jessica run past your Mom and out the door saying \"Ewwwwww! I KNEW you were creepy!\"\n\nYour Mom tells you to stay away from her. You comply but you don\u0027t understand why. You thought she had those feelings for you. She asks where the hell did you get a sick fucking idea like that. You mention the kiss.\n\n\"It was a peck on the lips! Nothing more!\" Your Mom shouts. You suddenly feel very very small. You curl up in a ball not knowing what to think anymore.\nYour Mom sees that you need many years of professional help and eventually has you put away in an institution where drugs work wonders on your screwed up thought process. No more emotions. Back to normal.\n\nAnother day in your cell and you feel nothing...\n","page 103":"Even though you know your sister doesn\u0027t like Mom, she\u0027s still family, and needs to realize that Mom\u0027s only looking out for her. You have to convince her.\n\nYou go up to your sister who doesn\u0027t want anything to do with you after this morning, but you tell her what Butch was bragging about. She doesn\u0027t care and while she claims she doesn\u0027t believe you, you can tell she does, but her dislike for you and Mom is greater than Butch\u0027s infidelity. You start to get angry and start to yell at her saying that she doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s good for her, you attempt to get physical, but Butch stops you as he\u0027s coming out of the school.\n\nThis results in you picking up a nearby rock, and smacking him in the head with it a couple times knocking him to the ground, your sister runs off and you go chasing after her in an attempt to show her the \"light\".\n\nYou finally catch her in the park, where you give her an ultimatium of either obey Mom\u0027s rules or die. Your sister can\u0027t believe how over the edge you\u0027ve gone until you start choking her. So enthusiastic you are to display your loyalty to Mom by \"punishing\" your sister, you don\u0027t even hear a passing police officer say \"GET YOUR HANDS OF THE GIRL OR I\u0027LL SHOOT!\"\nThe officer was enthusiastic too.\n\nYou feel three bullets hit you in the body, one more in the head and then you feel nothing...\n","page 104":"Your sister is hopeless. You feel anger towards your sister, you can see that she doesn\u0027t appreciate all the sacrifices Mom makes for her. You hope she does move out, that\u0027ll leave you and Mom more time to spend together.\n\nYou head home and wait for Mom to arrive. When she steps in, you hug her as she comes in the door, she hugs you back.\n\nShe tells you to do some chores, but you don\u0027t mind, in fact you\u0027re happy to do them. You and Mom talk a little more than you normally do at dinner, now that your sister is out of the way and not around to cause trouble everything is good, and you feel wanted for the first time in your life.\n\nYou talk into the night with her, until she tells you its time to go to bed.\n","page 107":"You want to stay up all night talking with your Mom, you\u0027ve never felt closer to her than you ever have in your entire life. Underneath her cold exterior, you can see a gentle and caring woman. She\u0027s just lonely...\n\nYour Mom says she has to go to work tomorrow and has to go to bed herself. She says you can stay up though if you want, but not to bitch about it when she wakes you up tomorrow.\n\nShe leaves, and you feel a little confused, you\u0027re not sure how to proceed.\n","page 106":"You do what Mom says and go to bed. You wonder if you should\u0027ve pursued another path, with her, but you quickly dismiss such thoughts. You realize that if Mom wanted anything else from you, she would\u0027ve told you. For now, she wants you to be a good and obedient son, just like you\u0027ve always been. No strange thoughts, just total subservience to her. Submission of your will to her, emotions just make things more complicated. You make it a promise to yourself to do just that.\n\nAnother day breaks, and once again you feel nothing...\n","page 55":"You decide its time to take control of the household. After all you\u0027re the fucking man of the house, and that bitch Mom of yours better realize that, besides the shift in power is in your favor with your sister on your firmly on your side now.\n\nYour prepare your sister for the coming confrontation with Mom, she looks less than excited to do it, but you helped her a lot today and agrees it needs to be done.\n\nWhen Mom comes home you immediately go on the offensive, totally catching her off guard. You do most of the fighting, your sister only piping up when you ask her to, you unleash a litany of cruel truths to your Mom. You mention how she\u0027s a lonely dried up over the hill woman who needs someone in her life because she\u0027s an unhappy person. So if she knows what\u0027s good for her she\u0027ll start treating you both with more respect. And that\u0027s just one of the things you say. Not that she isn\u0027t totally without ammo, but you feel actually energized by the battle. Like you\u0027re getting off on the conflict. Eventually you wear her down and she half-heartly gives in.\n\nYou know that your Mom is never going to be docile, but you\u0027ve effectively changed the balance of power. You go to bed totally pleased by your victory. Your confidence transformed into arrogance and finally into outright manipulative nastiness.\n\nAnother day arrives and you feel like Mom...\n","page 109":"You sit and watch TV dejectedly and wonder about what just happened.\n\nCould it be that you imagined things? Let it run wild? You suddenly realize what has been occurring in your mind. And it isn\u0027t right. You realize you\u0027ve been thinking VERY sick thoughts about your mother. You couldn\u0027t help it though, she seemed so nice to you today...\n\nBut no! You have to supress these feelings! Its the only way. you struggle all night with your derranged mind until you fall asleep with the TV still on.\n\nThe next day you awake, something\u0027s different...it worked.\n\nYou feel nothing...\n","page 56":"Heh heh, let sis handle Mom, you\u0027re going to do something you\u0027ve never done. Party all night!\n\nYou end up going to a club and even though you haven\u0027t really had any previous experience with these places or any other major social gathering you seem to fit in very well. It amazing how far your new outlook on life has taken you within a short period of time.\n\nYou realize that following all those rules was idiotic. You\u0027re going to have fun and anyone who tries to stop you is going to pay the price. Nobody is more important than you.\n\nYour home life changes quite a bit. Now its Mom yelling at you constantly rather than your sister, who seems to have calmed down quite a bit.

Its time to stand up to him, since she won\u0027t do it.\n\nYou immediately pull him aside and tell him to stay away from your sister.\nHe laughs in your face and pushes you to the ground. Then his six friends stand up...\n\nHowever your recent actions of defending Aaron cause him to try to help you out, by kicking Butch in the shin. Butch winces in pain, but immediately turns his attention to Aaron. He and his friends ignore you and beat the shit out of him. Seriously injuring him.\n\nThe following events occur due to your hubris...\n\nAaron has to be hospitalized and never fully recovers from suffering minor brain damage.\n\nButch and his friends are charged, but ultimately nothing comes of it, since most of their parents are rich and Aaron\u0027s weren\u0027t. Charges are dropped. They\u0027re all expelled and school is sued however.\n\nYou are also expelled since its determined that you started the fight in the first place, not to mention you your previous actions of fighting with Henry earlier that day, displays that you\u0027re a trouble maker.\n\nYou sister blames you for Butch dumping her permanently, despite the fact you were actually trying to help her.\n\nFinally Mom gets SUPER pissed off at you for causing all this shit, causing her to miss lots of work. She sets you straight by breaking your will once more which is rather easy since you blame yourself for all of what happened.

Strange, killing her has completely deadened your emotions again.\n\nYou decide to go to bed.\n\nYou awaken to police taking you away.

I\u0027m getting liquored up tonight!\" your sister says and disappears into the crowd heading towards the bar.\n\nYou quietly sit in an empty booth, for some reason you start to feel a little less adventurous again.
