An Albino business-minded Council Member named Mr Maximov. Strangely, the third figure is a blue-skinned Probiscan in a cheap suit and wearing a translator headset.\n\n\n\"Greetings, Council Members. My name is Alec Maximov, though if you don\u0027t know that I\u0027m quite worried that you\u0027re leading the free world.\" Mr Maximov begins.\n\n\nThis elicits a light chuckle from the crowd, which Maximov smiles at.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s a pleasure to see you all. I\u0027m here to talk about illegal workers in the Coalition. Look at Freddy, here. He\u0027s a Probiscan, obviously. When you see him, you see the enemy of the Coalition. He is not. We have this stone mindset that the Probiscans are communist, that the Thar\u0027Garavan are murderers, the Brain Bugs are monsters and so on. That is not the case. Sure, their governments are, but the people are not. Freddy escaped from the hard Alliance life to work here. He\u0027s farmed, hunted, mined and even repaired Coalition ships to feed his family. We are here today to decide what to do with Freddy. Do we embrace him, and every Probiscan, Brain Bug, Antimite, Moogli, Thar\u0027Garavan, Mundar Dweller or anyone else who loves the Coalition and it\u0027s values? Or do we cast them out and leave them with nothing? There are hundreds of thousands of immigrants to the Coalition. Just because their race hasn\u0027t joined us, they can\u0027t join us? Is that what we want? Please, vote to keep the illegal workers, and give them a new home.\"\n\n\nMaximov and Freddy the Probiscan sit down. The opposition, another Council Member you vaguely recognize, takes the stand.\n\n\n\"Good evening, members of the Council. I\u0027m here today to oppose Council Member Cabana\u0027s proposal. The Council Member would have us replace the common human worker with aliens. These cheap workers are slowly replacing the human worker. They\u0027ll walk for a cheap cost, taking jobs from us! We can\u0027t be expected to take care of every species! This means we\u0027re taking care of the Alliance\u0027s working class instead of our own. Not only that, but by accepting these immigrants we\u0027d be blatantly insulting the Alliance and worsen our already terrible relationship. I don\u0027t think much more needs to be said. Thank you for listening.\"\n\n\nThe Council Member nods and walks off. You take out a small, flat tablet, the kind used by Council Members to vote, and immediately the options come up. Do you want to pass the proposal and allow Alliance Immigrants to join the Coalition?\n",

The Remnants want more political power, as most of their entire economy and culture is dedicated to fighting.\"\n\n\n\"What are our options, Cabana?\"\n\n\n\"Well, we could fulfill the demands, but that wouldn\u0027t end the many other racial issues. We really only have two options. Firstly, we could use military means to cease power. We\u0027d use soldiers to stop the aliens from uprising and cease power, giving the power to more human-friendly politicians. This would eliminate the issues and put humanity at the top. The Coalition as we know it would fall apart, but humanity would be able to remake it as the new Coalition. It\u0027d sacrifice the unity of all species, but humanity would surive.\"\n\n\n\"And the other option?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not sure this would work, but if you think you have enough reputation among the species, and the Coalition is united enough and loyal to you. We might, and I mean might, be able to reunify the Coalition, but only if the other species are still at least partially united and loyal yo you. Take some time and think about this. The faith of the Coalition is in your hands.\"\n",

They occurred when Tortoises breed with an unknown alien carnivore, creating a red shelled, black skinned, eight-legged tortoise with carnivorous teeth. They are used as pets, to hunt vermin and and to fight.\n\n\nThe Life-Trees are small, partially sentient plants. They are the size of potted plants, and have the intelligence of mice.\n\n\nPumi\u0027Garavan are large, dog-like creatures. They have large jaws and tusks, and spines along their back and head. They are used as hunting companions by the Thar\u0027Garavan.\n\n\nFlurets are large bird-like creatures the size of dogs, used as scouts and hunting companions by the Moogli,\n\n\nRock Centipedes are cow sized centipedes used as livestock, pets and guard animals by the Mundar Dwellers.\n\n\nFenrir are hedgehog-like creatures the size of dogs, with a pack mentality. They are used as companions and attack animals by the Probiscans.\n\n\nWalkers are omnivorous, small, humanoid, short-haired mammals with green fur spotted yellow to act as camouflage. They eat seeds, nuts and berries, and have yellow arms and legs with a yellow stalk growing out of the top of their head, topped with a red ball. They communicate through radio-waves, and are nomadic creatures. They have the intelligence of monkeys. Due to their peaceful nature and odd appearance they are seen as good luck charms by most species, and killing them has become taboo.\n",

Notable mass-users of non-regulation equipment are the Ravens, a fleet of Falcon bombers painted black and upgraded with dozens of non-regulation upgrades, and 6th Company, which has been found to be using massive amounts of non-regulation weapons. Another common \"upgrade\" is upgrading the personality cores of Machines that hold AI\u0027s to be funnier, less robotic and meaner, in some cases.

Surely you could at least hide your disgust at my appearance.\"\n\n\n\"Sorry, Mr Cabana.\"\n\n\n\"Please. Call me Gus. Mr Cabana was... well, not my father. My father was a bug, like hyper-evolved diarrhea. I believe Mr Cabana was my mother\u0027s father. Anyway, thank you for supporting the Mundar Dwellers. I put a lot of my reputation on the line that you\u0027d support this. Still, those Rebels better join the Coalition. My fiance going to have my head otherwise.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re engaged?\" You ask, curiously.\n\n\n\"Yeah, to my childhood sweetheart. I met her in high school, back when I was just the nerd who loved math, comics and whose dad was a parasitic alien. Still sometimes I worry that she doesn\u0027t really love me, and she\u0027s only with me for my looks.\"\n\n\nGus chuckles, before taking a long drink of Thar\u0027Garavan Rum.\n\n\n\"God that\u0027s delicious.

After a while, you\u0027ve managed to successfully to dock. Gus stands up and walks to the docking station, where Mrs Chang waits.\n\n\n\"Remember, the Mundar Rebels should be treated incredibly differently to the Loyalists. The Rebels prize commerce to an extreme. The majority of the rebels were business or trade orientated before the civil war, so make sure to talk how many trade advantages there are in the Coalition. Also, do not call them Rebels. Call them Revolutionaries. Understood?\"\n\n\n\"Of course.\" Gus replies.\n\n\nThe door opens, and you walk out. Mundar Dwellers stand on either side, Rebels on the left and Loyalists on the right. You stare directly the Mundar Dweller on your left. He, or possibly she, is about four and a half feet tall,large and muscular with deathly pale, thick skin, and he, or she, has a set of teeth quite similar to a human. He, or she, has tiny eyes, large flat ears and a massive nose. The Rebel pats a fist against his red armored breastplate, which you assume is a Mundar Dweller gesture.\n\n\n\"Achilles, let\u0027s go.\" Cabana says, patting you on the shoulder. \n\n\nYou walk along the hallway, which is little more than a tunnel through rock. You walk for a few minutes, before arriving into a large conference room. Three massive robotic Generals from the Remnants stand at the head of the table, next to two identical-looking men with salt and pepper hair, a single Tarn Drone and two giant aliens wearing what looks like ancient diving suits that were filled with a symbiotic goo. You take your seat with them, the Coalition\u0027s representatives. At a right angle to you are the Rebels, who sit at the head of one of the tables. There\u0027s over twenty of them, all wearing some form of Armour or clothes painted or dyed bright red. Across from you are the Alliance Representatives, five Creators wearing metal space suits and staring around the room, as well as a Probiscan Enlightened One, a Moogli Commissar, a Brain Bug Admiral and an Antimite Monarch. At the other end of the table are the Loyalists, who are represented by a single man, the Chief, due to their communist nature.\n\n\nGeneral White-Eye stands up, and raises a fist. You put on your headset, and White-Eye lets out a series of unintelligible grunts.\n\n\n\"Greetings, Esteemed Leaders of the Sentient Beings of the Galaxy.\" Your headset translates. \"I would like to thank you all for coming here to discuss our newfound independence from the Alliance.\"\n\n\n\"Is that completely necessary? There could be a lot done to make your membership to the Alliance more beneficial.\" A Creator says.\n\n\n\"Let the General talk.\" A Remnants\u0027 General says.\n\n\n\"My colleagues and I believe that the Mundar Dwellers should stand on our own. The Chief disagrees, so our people tried to *WORD UNTRANSLATABLE*.\"\n\n\nThe Chief paused, looking for the right words.\n\n\n\"So our people tried to... express their freedom. But these fights are a case of breaking the pick instead of the stone, as the old saying goes. So I would like to discuss our leaving the Alliance.\"\n\n\nThe Probiscan Enlightened One stands up abruptly, and lets out a high pitched whistle, which you remember is the way Probiscans communicate.\n\n\n\"Why is the Coalition here? This is no place for them!\" Your translator emits.\n\n\n\"If we leave the Alliance, we will join the Coalition.\" The General White-Eye says, before looking at you. \"If the Coalition will let us join, of course.\"\n\n\n\"It would be a pleasure to have the Mundar Dwellers join the Coalition.\" Mrs Chang says.\n\n\n\"I lead the Mundar Dwellers, and I say we stare with the Alliance!\" Chief Rock-Foot yells.\n\n\n\"In the interest of using simpler terms, I would ask that the... revolutionaries are known as the...\" Mrs Chang said.\n\n\n\"Free Mundar Republic.\" General White-Eye said.\n\n\n\"And the loyalists be known as the United Mundar Dwellers.\"\n\n\n\"The Council Member makes a fair point.\" One of the Creators said.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll use your *WORD UNTRANSLATABLE*, then.\" Chief Rock-Foot says, before letting out a yell and smashing his foot against the stone floor. \"Names! We\u0027ll use your names! These translators are cheap and ineffective.\"\n\n\nOne of the Remnants Generals, a massive, scarred machine, stands.\n\n\n\"There are bodies covering this planet.\" He says loudly.  \"There are bodies of Mundar soldiers spread among the battlefields of this Civil War. There is no re-uniting of the Mundar Dwellers. The United Mundar Dwellers can allow the Free Mundar Republic to leave, and spend the rest of today discussing planetary borders and discuss the nuts and bolts of this system. If this civil war continues, I\u0027ll be pledging the full military support of the Remnants. I\u0027d like to think the rest of the Coalition would follow me. The Alliance will follow suit, and there\u0027ll be a lot more bodies on a lot more battlegrounds. What\u0027s your choice, Chief Rock-Foot?\"\n\n\nRock-Foot paused. There was silence for what seemed like hours, before Rock-Foot nodded.\n\n\n\"With the help of the great Alliance, we could easily repel and even crush the Coalition. But I refuse to sacrifice even a single true, loyal Mundar life to do so. Go run to the Coalition. Take your traitor, scum-sucking world of maggots and go abandon the Alliance that fed and clothed you.\"\n\n\n\"Gladly.\" General White-Eye says, before mockingly patting his fist against his breastplate. \"Shall we discuss what you define as a \"traitor, scum-sucking world of maggots\"?\"\n\n\nYou grin, and settle down to begin discussing the details of the Free Mundar Republic\u0027s newfound independence. Now, Humanity has a new ally to make it all the more stronger, and the Coalition has a new member race.\n",
