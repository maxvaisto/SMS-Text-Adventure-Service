  "Because Basement Dwellers are people too!\nAdditional Notes:\nThis story is three stories in one. Your first choice will lead to a separate tale of a different “basement dweller”. Each one is mostly different in tone.\nEbay Escapist is weird and random. It’s the least verbose of the three. (Or my stories in general)\nGood Girl is the longest and most descriptive of the three. There is some weirdness going on here too, but is mostly kept much more in \"reality\". There is a cast of characters link in the beginning to help you keep up with who’s who.\nAnime Addict has a lot of offensive language and humor, so if you don\u0027t like that sort of thing you shouldn’t read this one.\nIn all the tales there are several endings varying in degrees of good/bad/neutral outcomes. While there are some endings better than others, these are basically just tales of basement dwellers."
