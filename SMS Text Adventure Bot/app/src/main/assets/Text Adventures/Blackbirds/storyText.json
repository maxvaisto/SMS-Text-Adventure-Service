  "page 123": "They suspend you from the ramparts after the tea party finishes. Your cage, little more than the size of a coffin, is hung by a single chain. All in all, it’s not a far drop to the ground. Meaning, if you get a moment to yourself, then the artifact could let you out, and broken legs wouldn’t be waiting for you at the bottom. There’s still a chance though. There always is. The drop, while not fatal, isn’t exactly something you’re looking forward to. It’s probably been two hours since the “fight.” The doc ignores you with silent hatred, learning to hold off engaging with you. Since another incident likely has you hanging from a noose rather than in a cage, you understand. Alteran soldiers guard the ramparts above and patrol the ground below. Yep, this isn’t exactly how you imagined things would go.\n\nThey stripped you of your armor and weapon sheaths, not noticing a lone black ring on your finger. They’re soldiers after all, not scavs. The cage offers just enough space for you to sit with your knees pulled in tightly to your chest, as long as you don’t mind steel digging into your back and toes. There’s a decent breeze, one you never noticed being inside the garrison or in the overgrowth. Exposed in the air, however, it brings a chill, increasingly so, as the cage slowly drops in temperature.\n\nAny ideas, voice?\n(Yes, but I’m more interested to see what you come up with.)\nLotta help you are.\n(More than you are. I’d like to see you become a key.)\n\nTime passes as you try to think of possible solutions. If the Alterans were somehow distracted, then you could escape into the trees. Problem is, the only distraction you could cause would draw attention towards you rather than away.\n\nDo you have the ability to move on your own?\n(Apart from you? Not in this state.)\n\nAs you’re thinking, a voice carries from below. It’s one you recognize almost instantly, one that you hoped wouldn’t notice your presence. “Your deeds have finally caught up to you. Where’s that traitor of a corporal?”\n\nBastus. He looks better than when you saw him in the dungeon. More color appears to be in his skin, the difference a few hours of sunlight and stretching can do. But still, he’s more frail than you’re used to seeing.\n\n“Bastus…” you start, not sure what to say. There are no words to right the wrong in his mind. A betrayal, as sudden and unexpected as they come, is all he sees, deepened by years of shared battle and living. The bond forged between soldiers is not easily broken, yet when it is, it’s damaged beyond all repair. A soldier must learn to deal with loss. There’s no redemption for a liar. Cut ties and move on. You could tell him how your actions saved the life of the company. How you had no choice in the matter. That your actions brought about the greater good. Shit, now you’re starting to sound like Redding.\n\n“You always did fancy yourself smarter than the rest of us, didn’t you?” Bastus starts. “Not smart enough to trade uniforms for the losing team, though huh?”\n\n“You have to understand, it was all to--”\n\n“All to betray your company? Your friends? Your family? Redding was always an odd one. There’s less of a surprise when an unconventional man makes an irrational decision. But you, you were supposed to be the opposite. It pains me to say so, but your death is well-deserved. You’ve taught me--the entire company--a valuable lesson: you never truly know who your friends are.”\n\nThere’s no response to that. Shame builds inside, not because of events that occurred, but because you’re unable to formulate thoughts and words to accurately convey your side of the story. A man that you’ve lived closely with over the last few years thinks you are the most despicable of people, and you’re unable to convince otherwise. Bastus’ words hurt, a small sliver of what he probably felt seeing you in Magda crimson. For the greater good, you tell yourself. It’s a burden that you have to bear, even if the company doesn’t realize you’re bearing it for them.\n\nBastus speaks again. “I’ll be there during your hanging. Though I won’t be as joyful as the others.”\n\nHe leaves you alone, his words hanging heavy on your heart. Not the most immediate problem, however. Redding still needs you. If there’s any redemption to be had, it’s in saving his life. The company thinks you a traitor. You are, technically, and it’s that fact which keeps them still breathing.\n\nOne member of the company still needs your help. Let Bastus and the others think what they want; you can’t control that. You only control your own actions. You’ve made peace with them so far. After all you’ve been through, the story can’t end with Redding bleeding out, alone, and you facing the gallows. The possibility of a premature ending, a quiet death after the firestorm you’ve endured, brings a tinge of rage within your bones. LIke that of your battle flow state, it comes, a persistence, the inability to quit while you still can act. True, your options are rather limited, but damn if you won’t do something about it.\n",
  "page 122": "There’s no telling how soon the garrison will be sent packing to the Old World. You don’t have time to find out either. You need to act, and fast. You scan the crowd of Magda soldiers, looking for a doc. Off in the distance, you hear a laugh echo from the ramparts, followed by clinking of tea cups. Rules of war, you know. Still, it seems a tad insensitive for the garrison’s leader to show such obvious enjoyment while his men are herded like farm animals.\n\nFinally your eyes land on a man near the edge of the soldiers. His build is thin. Like Benjamin, and a lot of the Magda soldiers, his features are sharp, a thin pair of spectacles sitting at the edge of his pointy nose. One look and you know he’s not a soldier like the rest. Arms are too frail for a sword. Better suited for a scalpel. He’s the small puppy barking directions at war horses. Just what you need.\n\n(I’ve seen that look in many mortals before. You’re about to get us into trouble, aren’t you?)\nNo more than usual.\n\nYou hear the sound of Benjamin spitting as you walk away from the man. At least he’s content to stay put. You don’t need him following you around and causing problems. You imagine you’ll have enough problems of your own, by your own making no less. Through the crowd of Magda soldiers you go, taking notice that you are the only one in motion. The rest simply stand around, waiting. They’re about to have a hell of another show.\n\nThe man’s hair is in the process of becoming more silver than brown, straight and combed back. Not long enough to be tied, but close. He notices you approach as most of the soldiers do. “A man could get nervous with a fellow approaching like that,” he says lightly. The good-natured voice likely has calmed more than a few “excited” patients in his day.\n\n“Perhaps in the dark of night. Here, however…” you display your arms out towards the hundreds of eyes upon you.\n\n“What is it you want.” The doc abandons his friendly opening.\n\n“Spear wound under the arm. Clean, but deep. Very deep. Marginal loss of blood. How long can a man last?” you ask.\n\nThe sudden question relating to his expertise draws the doc from his antagonist demeanor. He scratches his chin. “For a soldier in good health, assuming that’s what you mean. Hmm. Oh I’d not give the man more than a day unless treated properly.”\n\n“Good. That’s all I needed to know.” You fumble with your hands a bit to draw the doc’s eyes downward.\n\nNow comes the fun part.\n(Comparatively, I sense.)\n\nYou move quickly, far quicker than the doc can react to. You slide your body forward, while still keeping proper posture, the only movement a slight shifting of your feet, without long, winding motions of your body. The doc’s gaze still down, he doesn’t register it until it’s too late. The bridge of your nose rams straight into the doc’s forehead. By all intents and purposes, without the eyes deft enough to catch the entirety of the motion, it appears that the field surgeon headbutted you, a cheap shot.\n\nYou withdraw with, perhaps, too much of a dramatic flair, but it’s attention you seek. And attention is damn well what you receive.\n\n“Bastard!” you shout, clutching at your nose.\n\nThe doc doesn’t seem to realize what is happening, and why should he? Who asks a medical question and then rams the soft part of their face into another’s skull? He certainly doesn’t realize you’re firing “back” a shot of your own until your fist slams into his gut, doubling him over. You avoid his head for obvious reasons. He still needs his wits about him to heal Redding. Also, nine times out of ten an opponent doubled over will--\n\n--his body tackles yours to the ground. The odds land true. His shoulder lands in your stomach, sending an audible groan along with your air from your lungs. You eat a punch. And another. You take one more before hooking the doc’s arm, trapping it, before reversing the position. Any time now... They don’t break you up right away so you take the opportunity to place both hands around the man’s throat, not tight enough to choke him completely, but just enough to make him squirm. Finally, you’re pulled up by an Alteran under each arm.\n\n“Did you see that? He headbutted me for no reason!” you yell, playing the part of the righteously wronged. The blood pouring from your nostril adds a nice effect.\n\n“The boy is mad,” the doc spits back.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who started it,” an Alteran soldier says, dressed in navy blue. The statement flows with the ease of a father. “You’re soldiers. Act like it. Now I want you to sit quietly until the meeting is over. Or else.” He gestures towards the two captains sharing a pot of tea on the ramparts.\n\n“No! I won’t let this...poor excuse for a surgeon get away with it! He let three of my friends die, and then attacked me when I brought it up.”\n\n(Ease back, fellow.)\n\n“I have no idea what he’s talking about!” the doc exclaims. “I have never seen him before in my life.”\n\n“ENOUGH,” the Alteran’s voice booms across the garrison. In the corner of your eye, you see the tea party casually glance your way. “You two give me no choice.” The soldier motions to a few others, who wander over. A group of them huddle together, deciding your fate. It seems they will collectively decide to lock you in the dungeon as none possess the rank to decide it by themselves. After a few moments of whispering and head nodding, your favorite Alteran soldier returns.\n\n“You’re going in a place where you can’t cause any more disruption. Your uncivilized behavior, the both of yours, means you’re a danger to others. If you’re going to behave like animals, you’ll be locked up like animals.”\n\nThen he says a few words that wipe the internal grin from your mind.\n\n“The hanging cages for you two.”\n\nYour actions have gotten you locked up alright. Locked up in a single cage suspended from the top of the fort for all to see. The lock is not troubling. The constant supervision of a thousand soldiers, is. You doubt the artifact gives the ability to fight an entire battalion. The cage is irrelevant. But still, you’re not going anywhere for a while.\n",
  "page 125": "Time is short. Too short. If the noose waits for you, certain death, then you’re not going to sit and wait for the rope to be placed around your neck. There is a time to act, and there is a time to bide your time. Redding’s condition doesn’t afford you any more slack. The time is now. You will the artifact to mould to the shape. It’s not exactly a command; it’s something different, like recalling a memory, the subsiding of a dream when awakening in the morning.\n\nIn order to mask the maneuver, you stretch your arms out, feigning like stiff shoulders are starting to wear on you. Both hands grip the cage, which is oddly just an oversized cage for a bird. Or rather, it’s a Blackbird cage. Disobedient soldiers get thrown in the dungeon, the same goes for prisoners of war. True enemies get the cage, a status you find yourself in currently. Click. You unlock the cage door, but don’t escape just yet. Let it come as a surprise.\n\n“I saw that.” Now the doc is speaking to you. “What the hell kind of sorcerer are you?”\n\n“One that means not to die imprisoned,” you answer.\n\n“And if I cause a commotion and ruin your escape? I’m only here because of you.”\n\nA Redding-esque grin appears at your lips. “A commotion is exactly what I want from you.”\n\nBefore the doc can respond, you will the artifact into the strange gun, ravenblack, wing-tipped with the rotating cylinder.\n\nHow many shots, again?\n(Six. Then nearly as many seconds to recover.)\n\nYou put the first of six into the chain holding the doc’s cage. For the second time today, he has no idea of the sudden events transpiring, both of which are very unfortunate for the man lucky enough to draw your attention. His mouth is wide open, the same for his eyes. Wide in surprise, horror--perhaps a mixture of the two. Both of his hands grip the cage, tight, like the way a sailor climbs the mast for the first time. One moment he’s suspended next to you. The next, empty air.\n\nThe sound is like a galleon discovering a coral reef with her underbelly. Every Alteran soldier within sight rushes towards the fallen cage, whether to check on the doc’s well-being or integrity of the cage is up for debate. Just what you need. You take the chance to slowly open the cage door so as not to cause a sudden squeak. You climb to the top, using all four limbs the way a squirrel or similar forest creature would scamper up a tree. Before heading up the chain, your foot deftly nudges the door back to its position. You’re more likely to be seen if the cage door is wide open.\n\nYou straddle the chain, hugging your body close. You’ll likely be facing more than a few men in combat, and so you disperse the energy expenditure throughout your entire body rather than gassing out your arms. Men shout. They rush down from the ramparts towards the collapsed cage, leaving the top of the wall mostly unguarded. Mostly.\n\nSwinging your legs over the side, two Alterans examining the chain\u0027s anchor look up as soon as your feet hit the ground. Two Alterans, your countrymen, your fellow soldiers. Can you even claim that? Well, you don’t have time to think through your status thoroughly. All you see is two men who will throw you back inside of a cage, and likely stand outside eyeing you the entire time.\n\nBlack smoke. Small thunderclouds. A wing-tipped club smashes into two skulls.\n\nA few missing teeth in exchange for many more years of life? You’re doing them a favor, even if they’ll need to eat mush for the next month or two. You abandon the Magda tunic and replace it with one of the Alteran’s navy overcoat. It’s not a perfect fit. Little loose around the torso. Better than nothing, and you’ll have the ability to blend in with the now-Alteran fort with ease. You understand it’s not as simple as walking out the front gate. Not when there is a gathering crowd of soldiers checking on the fallen cage.\n\nYour best bet is through the dungeon tunnel. But first, you’ll need to pilfer supplies. You might not be able to bring an actual field surgeon, but you’ll settle for the tools of one. In all your battlefield experience, you’ve never had to do more than wrapping a tourniquet or one or two cauterizations. Redding needs to be stitched. With a surgeon’s needle and thread, you’ll have to do your best. Hopefully there’s a bottle of brandy lying around for anesthetic. You could use some yourself after the day you’re having, although it’s not nearly as bad as the day the doc is having.\n\nOn the ramparts, you eye a few wooden crates. They’re mostly empty, no more than two feet across. Whatever contents they carried has long been emptied and put to use. Waste not. You shut one of the crates, sliding a wooden panel on its designated track. It’s empty, but the passing Alteran won’t know it. As far as they know, you’ve been tasked with delivering the crate...somewhere. Chain of command, the High King loves it. It also means those directly in your chain won’t step out of line to question you. Thank you, High King.\n\nCrate in hand, you know exactly where you’re going. You may not know where the medical center is, but you know where all the supplies are kept: the quartermaster’s office. It’ll be run by an Alteran now, but everything you need will be there. You put on your best blank face and make your way there, treating it as if it’s your very duty. It is, in a sense, but not like the soldier’s will assume, which is fine with you. Along the way, you give a few nods to those who make eye contact. It’s unspoken, yet those wearing the same rank give their version of a sympathetic look. Running cargo isn’t the most glorious of positions, especially after taking over the fort of the High King’s greatest rival. It’s not exactly the glory-filled task to write home about.\n\nStanding in place of the Magda quartermaster, is a shrewd-looking Alteran, the type of person that always assumes whoever’s talking to them is lying, complete with over-compensating eye contact and distrust towards newcomers.\n\n“I didn’t order any more uniforms,” he states as you enter. “That’s what I assume those are, are they not?”\n\nYou glance down. Sure enough, there’s a small marking on the crate identifying its previous contents. Coats. It holds the insignia of the High King, so the battalion must have packed extra for their invasion. “I don’t care what you ordered or not. I just do as I am.”\n\nThe now-Alteran quartermaster’s eyes narrow. “As you are...oh, ordered.” He sighs. “Place them in the back, near the far wall. The former ‘proprietor’ was very loose with his cataloguing. It’s a mess. Luckily, those awful crimson tunics can be burned along with any flags or banners.”\n\n“Here?” you say, placing down the crate.\n\n“No! Not there. There.” The quartermaster points pretty close to where you are already.\n\n“Here?” you say again, moving the crate slightly.\n\n“No! Half-wit,” he utters under his breath, although it’s not as subtle as perhaps he intended. He sighs. “Must I do everything myself?”\n\nThe quartermaster takes the crate with both hands, bracing himself to lift a heavy object. When he picks it up with little struggle, a laugh almost escapes your lips. It’s similar to the way a tug-of-rope opponent may release tension on the rope, sending the other sprawling backwards. The quartermaster stumbles, gathering himself.\n\n“Here?” you say for a third time, not before landing a fist squarely on the quartermaster’s jaw. Lights out. Out cold. No time to tarry. You enter the stockroom, scanning down aisles of equipment. Swords, bucklers, armor, uniforms, boots, and finally, medical equipment. There are bundled cloth, different types of knives and cutting tools, bone saws included. You snatch a needle and thread along with a bottle that smells like spoiled wine mixed with drops of brandy.\n\nAs you’re about to leave, you catch men’s shouts and stomping of boots. You know exactly why: a certain cage must have been discovered to be empty. That, and perhaps two soldiers were discovered taking a nap on the ramparts, one of whom is missing a coat. Took them long enough. The good news is that you know protocol. Each company will be instructed into formation. Any stragglers, men wandering on their own will be detained. The bad news, of course, is that you aren’t assigned to a company, and even if you took place in one, it’s a small enough group that you’d be noticed as an imposter. For the second time, you’re faced not with a locked door or looking the part of Alteran soldier, but instead, your problem is concerned with the placement of one’s self, exposed, alone. Hard to blend in when there’s no one to blend in with.\n\nIf your stay in the quartermaster’s office will be longer than expected, and it seems that way, you might as well get comfortable. You tie the sleeping quartermaster up in the stockroom with rope that he’s accountable for, notably not logging it in the books. The white strips of bandage cloth make for a decent gag as well. The artifact and you, back to a gun in your palm, crouch near the door to listen outside and ambush any soldier that would wander inside.\n\nThrough the small windows, the street outside becomes filled with navy blue. The formation takes place in rows down the main walkway. Protocol says they will be directed down towards the main gate, which is where a thorough examination will take place. Once all the blues are verified, then an in-depth sweep will take place, meaning you’ll need to be long gone by that time. The ordeal will take nearly two hours, you estimate. There’s a thousand soldiers to count, after all. Man by man. The entrance to the fort’s dungeon isn’t too far away. There’s the small matter of getting there unseen.\n\nGot any more surprises that may help?\n(Surprises, yes. Helpful? Maybe not so much.)\n\nA sudden feeling of helplessness falls over you, though you’d care to not admit it. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Stay put, and Redding bleeds out. Make for the dungeon, or any place other than the office, and you get cut down in the street. All outcomes seem to point towards death, a sentiment that can be applied towards any point in your life. No matter what you do, death will come. At least you have the choice to decide how you may greet it. And who knows, maybe you’ll be able to slam the door in death’s face.\n",
  "page 124": "Time is short, yes. But acting too hastily would not only be condemning your fate, but Redding’s as well. Yours are both aligned; the heart pumping in your chest might as well be pumping blood through his veins. You had hoped the company wouldn’t discover your presence until you’re long gone. That’s the tricky thing about fate, huh? She’s a cyclone upon the sea, going where she damn-well pleases, no matter the destruction left in her wake.\n\n“All makes sense now. No true Magdan would act like you.”\n\nThe doc, listening to Bastus, seems to have put things together. Alexander’s “two friends” weren’t exactly meant to be secret. If anything, it was a strong inspirational message to kickstart praise for the Supreme Leader. If two Alterans decided the join the Supreme Leader, what can you do? Eerily similar to the posters placed on the billboard all those weeks ago before departing from Alteran. True creativity is hard to find. Most everything is imitation, colored and presented differently.\n\n“Guilty as charged,” you utter, not exactly in the mood to start a verbal debate with the man hanging next to you, which causes your next words to flow. “And yet you’ve received the same treatment. Surely, no true Magdan would act in such a way to find themselves here.”\n\n“Ah, piss off,” is the reply. So much for the argument.\n\nNo, there’s nothing more to do than wait for an opportunity of escape. One that normally is low odds, lowest of the low, but the artifact changes everything. It’s the winning card up your sleeve, the dagger (quite literally) in a fist fight. Now if there is just a way to remove the eyes that stare at your cage...\n\n---\n\nHours pass. You find yourself growing increasingly anxious watching the sun travel across the sky. You had a level of comfortability before, the knowledge of having minutes to spare; they grow smaller and smaller, the window of opportunity quickly closing upon itself. There’s a small measure of reassurance in the fact that causing your own scene would likely bring a premature end.\n\nAnd that’s just it. The end is here, premature or otherwise.\n\nIf you had known both paths led to death, perhaps your decisions would have been different. The thought causes a small laugh within your body, the kind that occurs during inappropriate times, a lecture hall, when being scolded, when faced with the most unfortunate of circumstances that somehow the only reaction is to laugh. All paths lead to death. Ha ha ha. Here, in the forest of the New World, what does it matter? In a few hours the problem will solve itself, and your anxiousness, dispelled.\n\nNot ten minutes later, your cage begins to lower in height, the way a sailor would loose an anchor. A steady grinding of steel sounds in the air, complemented with the cranking of a pulley-system. The ground approaches, not quickly. It’s the same speed as a man, knowingly, eating his last dinner before facing the gallows: it might be the same for you, minus the meal. An Alteran soldier fumbles with the lock, before swinging the cage door open. A pair of hands pull you out, more clasp on your shoulders in warning as if to say escape is futile!\n\nThe voice is silent, perhaps in protest to your actions. You still feel its presence, however, the constant buzz of energy, which makes the silence even more impactful. It’s letting you know of the power at your fingertips, yet denying you the use. It’s as if you’re dehydrated without coins in your pocket, staring through the window of an open tavern, its patrons spilling as many drinks on the ground as they manage to get down their throats.\n\nThe artifact that will “turn the tide,” isn’t doing much turning currently. It might as well be a ring on your finger; at least in that case you could sell it for a sword (or a final meal). They march you right back up the switchback stairs to the top of the ramparts, where all traces of the previous tea party are gone. Captain Briggs stands, hands clasped behind his back. Bastus is next to him, and on the ground watching, you see Lionel and the rest of the company.\n\n“I think you know why you’re here,” Captain Briggs states. His eyes narrow at you, the way a teacher would look at a disobedient student.\n\n“Yeah, I do,” you say, looking at the hands on your shoulder.”\n\n“Quant. I’m sure you understand what has to happen next?”\n\n“Yeah, I do,” you repeat with more sincerity.\n\n“Any last words?”\n\nIt’s a cliche question, but still, you find difficulty uncovering an answer. Last words. Whatever pours from your mouth will be the last, the words those in proximity will remember you by. Your life will be forgotten, a distant memory in others minds. Your thoughts, feelings, emotions--gone in an instant. Yet a remnant will remain, the areas in which those such things crossed, intertwined with others’ thoughts, feelings, and emotions, not to mention experiences. Experiences like this one, the hanging of a man, noose tied around his throat. What you say now will echo long after you stop breathing, live on further than you.\n\nThe same goes for your actions. Briefly, you entertain fighting your way out. To what purpose? That would be undoing all that you’ve done. The reason for going along with Redding’s plan in the first place was to preserve the life of the company, of your fellow Alterans. And what now? You’re thinking about killing Alterans to preserve your life, and that’s assuming you can cut your way through a thousand men. No. The decision’s already been made. You’re already a turncoat in their mind. Better to die a turncoat than a turncoat and murderer.\n\nAs you’re thinking, they place a noose over your head. It rests on your shoulders for a moment before getting cinched tight. It’s a lot heavier than you expected, tightly-bound rope. That’s something you never hear, though to be fair the people actually having such thoughts rarely have another chance to voice it. And suddenly you have it, the words to speak, ones that have gone unspoken. You’ll be the first. You’ll not result to begging, pleading to save your life.\n\nAll paths lead here. All decisions lead to death.\n\nExpecting a speech, you’re a bit surprised how quiet it is. Standing at the top of the ramparts, again, you notice details that you didn\u0027t before. The gentle breeze upon your skin, the gentle sway of tree leaves signaling that the forest is experiencing the same. The nervous way in which men glance, unsure of themselves, a few such men stare at your boots rather than in your eyes. You wonder what they’re thinking, if they’re putting themselves in your place, pondering the final moments of their life and the final words they’ll speak. Lastly, the quiet itself. It’s nothing like the bustling cities of Alteran, overcrowded streets and population. The New World, yet as dangerous as they come, is somehow at peace with herself. It’s not even the calm before the storm; it simply is to her nature, both peaceful and dangerous.\n\n“They never tell you how heavy these things are,” you state, thinking of the noose, but then noticing how it applies to the execution itself.\n\n“Not to worry,” Bastus says. “You won’t carry the burden for much longer.”\n\nHe’s right. Over the edge of the ramparts, you’re falling. Then, silence, save for the steady sway of your body in the wind.\n",
  "page 127": "Walking outside means certain death. No question about that. Getting yourself killed is condemning Redding to the same fate. You must wait for the opportune moment. You briefly entertain playing the clueless soldier tasked with transport again. Surely it couldn’t work now, right? You don’t want to risk it. One mistake, and you’re done, the both of you. Time passes. More footsteps echo from outside. They grow softer.\n\nYou glance outside again. There’s still a large amount of soldiers in formation, but the majority seem to be near the gate. Despite the smaller number, it’s still too many to risk leaving the quartermaster’s office. Might as well get comfortable. You’re not completely out of time for Redding yet. He’s in decently-good shape. The retreat from the Blackbird war party proved that. The problem is you don’t know his condition on the inside, whether the spear tore into a vital organ. Likely not, but it wouldn’t be the first time the man’s card playing face fooled you.\n\nSuddenly, footsteps.\n\nNot in unison, marching away from your location as the soldiers lining the streets. But irregular, with a purpose, growing in volume. If they decide to visit the quartermaster for supplies they’ll be in for a wing-tipped surprise. The artifact becomes a dagger in your hand, just as you found it. Full circle, like you throwing on the Alteran coat. Louder and louder they become, like a wave slowly building before the crash. And crash, they do.\n\nThe front door to the office swings open. You’re hidden from view, ready to flank the newcomers as soon as they step foot inside. You dare not breathe heavily for fear of being heard. Instead your breath becomes slow, deliberate. Your body screams at you to act, to release the building tension. Yet you wait for all, sounds like three pairs of boots, to enter. It’s actually four.\n\nFour navy coats enter into the office. “Quartermaster!” one of them, you’re not certain who shouts towards the stock room. If they were to wander in, they’d find the man bound and gagged. With the fort on high alert, silence from the quartermaster isn’t a good sign either. You don’t give them the chance to discover him.\n\nYou creep forward, dagger in hand, crouched as to absorb the weight of your steps through your legs. His back is turned, a long sweeping overcoat, navy blue, just as the High King commissioned. You dye it the same color as the Magda tunic. Back turned, the Alteran doesn’t have time to react. In fact, you don’t even have time to think about killing a fellow Alteran, someone who journeyed with you from the Old World into the New, experienced the landing and march to Frontrunner’s. Two men on the ramparts didn’t bother you; they could be disposed with less-than-fatal means. But four. Four is a different story. It’s either me or you, and you know who wins every time.\n\nOne drops, drawing the attention of the others. It was unrealistic to quietly take out one without alerting the others. You see that now. Even without a floorboard creaking, a hand covering a mouth, there are still audible signs--as muffled as they may be. Three heads turn in your direction. Thunderclouds. Smoke. The dagger becomes a longsword. You take the offensive, meaning to put an end to things before they can officially begin. The ravenblack blade tears through flesh. The next soldier drops before managing to draw his own sword. The other two, however, meet your attack with equal ferocity, propelled by the sudden death of their two companions.\n\nThey’re good. Better than most. The instructors in the Alteran military are truly the greatest in the world. Unfortunately for your opponents, you, also, have instruction from the greatest, and you took to it more than most. The ravenblack blade becomes a dark blur, not letting the Alterans time to counter with their own attacks, else they risk one of your swings landing true. The artifact in both hands, you feel the tide turning in your favor, just like Redding foresaw. Redding! The thought of the man fuels your attacks, finding openings in both man’s defenses. Four Alterans walked in, four lie bleeding on the wooden floors.\n\n“There he is! Quartermaster’s office!”\n\nA shout rings from outside. Through the still open front door, you’ve managed to draw the attention of every soldier in formation outside. Rather than a stoic demeanor, eyes and head straight forward, all gaze towards the open door, towards you. A split-second later, they break formation. In less time, you make for the back. There’s got to be a back door, second entrance. Hell, you’d settle for a small window at this point.\n\nThere’s no such thing. It’s essentially a warehouse, a building designed for stocking large amounts of material, not needing sunlight or second entrances, which only make for alternative solutions for thieves to break in...or murderers, traitors to escape capture. You run down the aisles anyway, desperate for anything. All that greets you is rows and rows of equipment, along with one smug looking quartermaster, despite his current state. You can feel his eyes upon you, likely knowing the curses that would flow from his mouth should you remove the gag.\n\nFootsteps grow louder. They’re nothing like before. Four men first approached. Now, there’s hundreds. They can’t all fit into the office, but enough can, enough that will eventually overwhelm you, artifact or no. A sinking feeling starts in the pit of your stomach. You’ve been faced with perilous, hopeless situations before, some since arriving to the New World. This feels different, like saying goodbye to a friend you won’t see again. More footsteps. The smile underneath the quartermaster’s gag is almost palpable.\n\nSoldiers pour into the stockroom like a water pump with a broken valve. There’s no going back. Many pour through the opening , many you will put down before joining them. That’s all you can do. The voice is silent, perhaps in protest to your decisions. It’s not the ending you wished for, hoped for. But it’s the one you receive now.\n",
  "page 128": "It’s not the best of plans, but it’s a plan nonetheless. How many times have you been told the artifact will turn the tide of the war? Feels like at least a dozen, although you know that might be an exaggeration. It may not be war on a grand-scale, but it might as well be for you, grand, the climax of your life as a soldier, first starting in the Old and traveling to the New World.\n\n(Suddenly, I’m regretting the decision to bond with you.)\nShut up. No you’re not.\n(Fine. Let ‘the artifact’ fall into the hands of another.)\nIt’ll be a simple dagger, like Redding possessed. Pick another after I’m gone. I don’t care.\n(So this is it then. Shame.)\nBlaze of glory.\n\nBut still, you don’t have to lead with fireworks. It’s served you before, might as well try it again. You creep towards the stockroom and look for equipment that will suit your needs. Weapons, no. Armor--actually, yes. Finding leather that fits, you strap it to your body underneath the Alteran coat. You’re heading towards the dungeon, so you decide to gather equipment that a jailor may require. Shackles, chained about four feet in length is what you set your eyes on. Heavy, sure, but topical. And it’s not like you need mobility, at least not without the ability to drop the shackles first. It’s a plan nonetheless.\n\nWith two chains over each shoulder, you exit the quartermaster’s office. Almost instantly, you feel all eyes draw to you. It’s only eyes, not heads. It wouldn’t be proper formation if soldiers turned their heads at a simple motion in the corner of their vision. You pretend not to notice them, heading straight for the dungeon, not too quickly, but just enough urgency to signal that the shackles are needed sooner rather than later. You make it halfway before a voice calls out, much farther than you first expected.\n\n“Stop! All are to report to their immediate commanding officer.” It’s a lieutenant by the sound. Not too much authority, but just enough to flaunt it. You turn and find your suspicion is correct. Of course the lieutenant\u0027s head and face are shaved perfectly to military preference.\n\nYou gesture at a shoulder with your chin. “I was told to run these to the dungeon.”\n\n“And who exactly told you to do that?”\n\n“Why the quartermaster, of course. He seemed reluctant to depart with these, if you ask me. But orders are orders.”\n\n“No one asked you,” the lieutenant quickly says. “Company?” You give the name of another that journeyed from Alteran in the fleet, not that you actually met them before. “Company leader?” You give the answer, Corporal Nueman. The lieutenant ponders a moment before saying, “All right then. Be quick about it. There’s an imposter among our midst.”\n\n“Don’t have to tell me twice...sir,” you say.\n\n“Oh and one last thing, soldier.”\n\n“Yes, sir?” you ask as you’re about to take another step towards the dungeon.\n\n“I’m Corporal Nueman. Well, previously. It’s Lieutenant now.”\n\nShit.\n\n“I’ve found the imposter! Take him!”\n\nBlaze of glory time. Two soldiers on the ramparts received the non-fatal approach from you. Surrounded, in the midst of hundreds of soldiers, you can’t afford such limitations. You’ll likely be hung anyway, so it’s not like offing a few soldiers will worsen your fate. Before you can give another thought to killing men that you’ve gone into battle with, instinct takes over. It overrides any sort of rational thought beyond the present moment. It’ll be another weight on your conscience later. That is, if you still have breath at the end of the day.\n\n(Ha ha! Let’s play. Step right up. Who wants to dance? I\u0027ve got enough for everyone. Comere, you. Ha ha!)\n\nThe voice, gone is the curious, questioning mind that you’ve dialogued with. Instead, you hear the fragmented thoughts of a broken mind, pieced poorly together. Yet another problem for another time. Seems to be a lot of that running around lately. All you can do now is focus on surviving. The rest is secondary.\n\nSix shots fire from the pistol almost immediately, six bodies dropping in the same amount of time. Internally you count. One, two… Swords draw in front of you, the same happening at your back. Can you? (Yes!) The artifact is back into a longsword in your palm, black smoke clears in front of you, fading into clear air. Three, four. Its recovery is due to the bullets then, not the shape of the weapon. Beyond it, you can see the confusion on the soldiers’ faces, the artifact’s power appearing to bypass their strict discipline, along with a pistol that fires six times, instead of the standard issue double barrelled flintlock.\n\nThey meet your charge. It’s you who has to keep moving. You’ll need to engage and disengage quickly. If you can make it to the dungeon, you give yourself good odds. Down a tunnel their numbers will mean nothing, especially if you possess a weapon with superior range, ammunition, and accuracy. Yes, if they follow you to the secret tunnel, then you’ll close their end with a pile of bodies. If you get there in one piece.\n\nSteel clashes against the ravenblack blade. It doesn’t ring the same way as steel. It’s a duller sound, more dense, the difference between knocking on a wall stud or empty wall. There’s no sense in trying to be defensive. That’d be delaying the inevitable. Your only hope is to cut a path through. Like the forest of the New World, a trail must be forged by your own doing. Instead of overgrowth, living men stand in your way.\n\nYou do as you are trained to do. You lose yourself to the moment. It doesn’t fail to arrive during battle, the flow state, as if another takes the reins of your mind; you’re simply a spectator along the way, like the flashbacks of your past, like a dreamer while asleep. The black blade sweeps through the air in a blur in motion. It doesn’t flash in the sun. It doesn’t ring like steel. It’s something else. Sinister. Powerful. Chipping shards of steel from Alteran sword edges, absorbing each blow without a shock to your arms. Once you have ample space--small thunderclouds, smoke. Six shots. Then the longsword appears again.\n\nYou sweep through the Alteran formations, not taking direct confrontation with any one soldier. They’re either quickly disposed of, or you move on to the next. After two full rounds of shots, they must understand the limitation of the gun, yet they don’t swarm once the longsword appears, seemingly hesitant as if a step forward would result in the six-shooter’s appearance. Finally, you make it to the door to the dungeon.\n\nAs if protesting your sudden arrival, two flintlock shots land near the door frame, one on each side. The shots may not exactly be in protest, but the jailer behind them sure is, especially once the clean shot is missed not once, but twice. You don’t recognize the man, but in your state it wouldn’t have mattered. They aren’t your countrymen right now. They aren’t your fellow soldiers--still something to address later. They’re obstacles in your way. The black longsword cuts the jailer’s flintlock into two pieces right down the center, splitting the double barrel into two singles. The jailer holding the weapon receives a similar treatment shortly after, from shoulder to crotch.\n\nYou don’t bother searching his belt for keys. Footsteps behind you. The tunnel lies ahead. Redding’s time is short.\n",
  "page 77": "They thought they were safe behind their walls. They thought their shiny armor would protect them. Fools. The Raven is above the craftsmanship in which they take pride in. They are godless men, outsiders from across the Great Sea. The Harri’ar treat them as such. When a tiger preys on your livestock, it must be put down. The tiger thinks itself a mighty predator until the very moment of its slaying. When the spear is raised high, only then does it understand. The same goes for the invaders. Trespassers, defiliers.\n\nThe Veil protected the warriors, a gift of magic from the Raven itself. The faith of their people rewarded them. Arrows fall harmlessly to the side, same for javelins. The men at the walls don’t possess any of the black smoke, large cylinders exploding in a burst of fire and smoke, tearing destruction through all in its path. No, these ones only possess simple weapons, and they do not know them like the Harri’ar. A warrior is a warrior despite the weapon in his hand. The outsiders feign as warriors, using black smoke and sharpened steel as their strength. Left without either and they are but jungle vines to be cut from the Harri’ar path.\n\nFire from Father Sun Himself tore through their walls like a rock dropped into a pond, rippling, spreading flaming destruction. Let them hide behind their walls now. Their safety, like their gods, are false. Bodies thrown from the crumbling gate, soldiers frantically trying to douse the flames. The high priests in their--in our--collective faith brought victory. Still, they mustered a defence, small men listening to the shouts of their chieftains. Horns sung in the battlefield, their sound bringing meaning to the invaders.\n\nLet them try. Let them struggle. Let them die.\n\n---\n\nThe Blackbird war party is entirely in the clearing, the area where the Magda garrison cut down the forest to mere stumps. You’re able to creep to the very edge of the treeline without encountering any warriors. They’re all concerned with attacking the keep and have not posted guards at their rear. Bodies clash. The ground is littered with countless bodies already. Like the trees, they’ve been cut down, also becoming stumps in many cases. And the day is still young.\n\nLike the sun high in the sky, a massive hole exists where the gate once did, its edges a reddish orange. The sight of the fiery impact draws you back to the voyage, fire raining down from above, ships sinking down to the ocean floor below. (It’s almost time.) Countless bodies on the ground, countless more still breathing, attacking. Like sand running through an hourglass, the Blackbird warriors pour through the narrow opening of the gate, through the blast, the wind caused by their rush helping keep the flames alive.\n\nIt’s not the most thought-out plan. It’s not by bravery or a sense of heroics. It’s simply all you can do. You charge from the brush, weapon drawn, fifteen other soldiers at your back. Arrows whizz past your head, friendly ones. The scouts fire a volley to guide you towards the enemy. Normally, the thought of arrows shooting this close to you would make you uneasy; however, after experiencing the scouts’ silent way in which they move, the flawless way they blend into the forest itself, you are completely comfortable. Relieved, even.\n\nYour longsword, in both hands, cuts through three Blackbirds before they even notice your presence. Now that they’re aware of the sixteen man flank, you put a bullet in two more, the boom of your flintlock no longer an issue. The Blackbirds are fearsome, standing a full head taller than you. What they aren’t is efficient. Heavy swings, telegraphed swings. They fight with full emotion, as a single warrior in a sea of them.\n\nAlthough it’s the first time fighting with the Magda scouts (although not the first with Prinn), the discipline of a soldier takes over. Redding and you are as unified as they come, and the scouts have the good instinct to supplement your onslaught with arrows, creating a finely sharpened dagger that cuts as finely as an experienced battlefield surgeon. Speaking of dagger…\n\nRedding wields it in his off-hand, letting Blackbird warriors taste the artifact that their ancestors died to protect, bound in un-death to protect, the very thing the war party came to reclaim. As far as “turning the tide,” it doesn’t appear to be anything more than a dagger, albeit one that\u0027s quality is beyond all. It’s just a dagger. (We’ll see about that.)\n\nThe Blackbirds that recognize it harbor a frenzy beyond belief. They swarm like bees disturbed in their hive. Suddenly, a sinking feeling starts in your stomach. The plan is going very wrong. The Blackbirds were lured here, yes, although losing the fort wasn’t accounted for, neither was rushing into a Blackbird war party as sixteen men. To make matters worse, the company is still locked in the dungeon, vulnerable to the attacking natives.\n\nYou allow the feeling to fuel your sword arm. The rage rises in your blood. Not here. Not now. Frustration, anger is a source of energy unlike any other. It burns within, focusing the mind. The world around you seems to meld into a single scene; no longer are there Blackbirds, defending soldiers, and fallen bodies. Instead, there’s just you. Your mind becomes only concerned with each swing of your blade, the trigger of your flintlock. All else be damned. The Blackbird warriors that dare challenge you are handled with ease, the flow state allowing you to smoothly tear through their defenses without a second thought--without a first one either. Your body simply reacts to whatever is in front of you, the mind far removed from taking the reins, is but a passenger through the carnage.\n\nYou’re slightly aware of the primal grunts that spill through your lips, a deep throaty sound that accompanies the swing of your sword. Deep in your state, words have no meaning. None could express yourself as clearly as the primal sounds. The guttural tone is communication enough. Tens, perhaps even a hundred, lie dead behind you on your path towards the garrison. More, still, stand in your way. More will die.\n\nA horn sounds in the distance, the same one that rang on your arrival to the garrison. From within the fort’s broken walls, the rallying cry of men shout. Alexander! He is organizing a counter attack. The horn brings you from your flow state. Instantly, thoughts begin to pour back in a great tidal wave. The company, the counter attack, the artifact, Prinn, the scouts, the High King, your standing with Frontrunner’s Camp--you shake your head in an attempt to dam the thoughts.\n\n“Kid!” Redding shouts. “We’ve got to move.”\n\n“Otherwise we’re directly in their would-be retreat path, I know!” you shout back.\n",
  "page 76": "There’s only enough space to travel single file, so you take your place in the rear. The tunnel is barely high enough for you to walk without crouching, though that’s mostly because your head is in a constant dip. After a while, the strain starts to tense up your neck, like that of sleeping at an awkward angle. One foot in front of the other, matching the pace of the boots in front of you, your mind starts to wander…\n\nHe falls from the branch, just out of reach from your grasp. Your childhood hand swipes at the open air. He falls gazing up at you, mouth wide open in a mixture of horror, surprise, and pain, both hands outstretched for your hand that missed by a fair margin. With a deadening smack, Prinn meets the forest floor like a pile of books discarded after a long lecture. His glasses, broken and cracked, hang loosely from the tip of his nose, the rock knocking his mask completely from his face.\n\nThree boys approach your fallen friend. Three boys, riled beyond all belief, revenge on their minds. Righteous revenge. The damage they mean to inflict is warranted. Justified. You see it in their eyes, glossy and unfocused on anything but Prinn’s fallen body. A flintlock could fire a few feet away, and it wouldn’t register in their minds. It’s your plan that brought you here; the damage to Prinn, on you.\n\nYour boots hit the ground next to your fallen friend.\n\n“Knowing the runt’s identity is as good as knowing yours,” Kelle speaks, his words like a blacksmith’s flame. “You’ll get yours too.”\n\nYou pull the mask from your face. Your young mind is aware of what must take place next, and the face covering will only get in the way, blocking out portions of your peripheral vision. Slowly, Prinn rolls over and pushes himself up, managing to stand by bracing himself on one of your arms.\n\n“Dareisay, Kelle, piss on your cheek, shit in your hair, and it only improves your looks.”\n\nIn a situation such as this, only Prinn would offer insults. Though to be fair, he offers them in almost any situation. Reminded of the chamber pots, rather than the identity reveal, Kelle’s teeth grimace, both hands balling into fists, joined by four others.\n\nYou raise your own fists defensively. “Come on then. Unless you’re scared.”\n\nThat angers Kelle more than Prinn’s jab. Nothing sets a young boy who fancies himself a young man off like calling him afraid. Good. As one yourself, you’re not surprised when Kelle charges forward, abandoning his superior numbers to a reckless rage. He winds up to throw all his power into a single right hand, telegraphing it in the process. Even untrained boys are able to dodge something as that, which you, in fact, are.\n\nKelle’s arm swings high. You duck underneath and pivot to the side, managing to shove Prinn out of the way in time. Kelle’s charge takes him past you, back exposed, and for a brief moment everything is clear. You’re aware of each of your opponents as well as Prinn, who probably couldn’t take any on his own. The only way out is to end the skirmish quickly. Otherwise, the boys would regroup and use their superior numbers and strength. It’s not honorable. It’s not pretty. You surely wouldn’t brag about it afterward.\n\nYou muster all your strength into a single kick. Your shin lands in-between Kelle’s legs.\n\nKelle’s hands reactively grab for his crotch as he crumples to the ground, fetal, knees tucked into his chest. Before you can celebrate your victory, as minor as it is, Kelle’s goons rush to his aid. If you took the time, you’re sure you could remember their actual names, but their importance is equal to the amount of time you spent remembering. They’re followers, lifelong “yes” men, too afraid to speak their mind, hiding behind their leader’s power and pretending it’s their own. But still, they’re boys, boys who bear the same rage from your prank, boys who are larger than you and Prinn.\n\nOne of them tackles Prinn to the ground in a flurry of dust, the contents of the chamber pot mixing with Prinn’s cloak and exposed skin. The other heads directly for you meaning to use the same tactic, strength over skill, both of which you are severely lacking as a boy. Your enemy charges, both arms outstretched to wrap you up. He’s a wild animal, a crazed bull, a body long absent from his mind, thanks to the ambush. His thoughts are primal. He sees a threat, and he charges, giving his own well-being not a second thought.\n\nBefore the boy can reach you, a match is lit within your mind. Within the timeframe, less even, of a single step towards you, a new feeling overwhelms your senses in a rush, like standing on a rooftop and feeling the wind against your body. The present moment may suggest you’re in the wrong, dumping waste on top of three boys, but the struggle started long ago, and not by you or Prinn. Kelle and his goons have been a thorn, no, more than a thorn in your side for the entire year; they’ve been a bramble thicket growing rampantly across your path. There’s but one remedy: they must be cut out, uprooted.\n\nA fire burns within you, not as untamed flames in a forest devouring all in grasp. It’s a focused beam of energy, a harnessed energy that you can draw from, tuning the mind and pouring strength to your limbs. Rage fills your body, and unlike the three boys, you master it, control it. The rage serves you, not the other way around. You bend it to your will the way a horse tamer breaks a wild stallion. You may not be the smartest, nor the physically strongest either. But the fire burns, stoked to last far greater than any other. The intelligent are powerless when they encounter someone more intelligent, the strong with someone stronger. You are not burdened by such flaws.\n\nThe boy closes within striking range. You keep a sturdy base in your feet. At the last second, you tuck your chin and line your forehead up with the bridge of the boy’s nose. A sickening crunch echoes, even above the sounds of the skirmish. A geyser of red appears on the boy’s face, mixing with the contents of the chamber pot. His momentum still carries into you, however, and the two of you go tumbling to the ground. The fire focuses you. Before you even hit the ground, you’re scratching, throwing short punches. After a few rolls, both of you trying to gain the upper hand, you end up on top. Like with Kelle, you feel the need to end it quickly. Your left hand holds the boy’s throat, holding his head steady, your right winds up, telegraphed, but your target isn’t going anywhere.\n\nPain explodes into your knuckles. The boy’s eyes roll back in his head.\n\nYou raise your fist again, meaning to rain down another devastating blow, one to an unconscious opponent. Prinn’s cry draws you from the act. Arm cocked, you turn to find Prinn pinned down, the other goon blasting ape-like fists down both at once. By now Prinn’s glasses are a crumpled mess, twisted, bent, and shattered nearly beyond recognition. A deep sound resonates through your throat, primal, the tone not needing coherent words to infer its meaning.\n\nYou imitate the rush of the three boys, charging head down, arms propelling you to greater impact. Your shoulder drives into the boy’s side, knocking him from Prinn. Your arms reactively reach down as you land, giving yourself two handfuls of dirt and fallen leaves from the forest floor, the leaves dead and scratchy in your open palms, which, naturally, you use to greet the boy’s exposed face. Blinded, coughing, he tries to locate you with his arms. You easily step past them, rising to your feet and sending a foot into his gut. And another. And another. Finally, you finish by kicking more dirt into his face.\n\n“It’s over!” you hear Kelle shout. He’s managed to recover from your kick, and stands holding Prinn by the back of his hair. That’s not what catches your eye, however. What does, is a heart-sized stone raised overhead. Over Prinn’s head. “One more move and I pound the little runt’s face into oblivion. He’s almost as bad at fighting as you are with exams.”\n\n“Put the rock down,” you try to state calmly. You notice a slight tinge to your voice and hope Kelle didn’t catch it.\n\n“Fat chance. You’re going to watch.”\n\nTerror seizes your body, overtaking the rage that beset you earlier. “Watch what?”\n\nGrinning, Kelle says, “On your knees, runt.” Prinn complies with a small amount of help from Kelle. The hand holding Prinn’s hair releases for a moment, but Prinn doesn’t move. The rock still threatens from above. Kelle reaches inside his robe, and although it’s hidden from behind Prinn’s head, you know exactly what he pulled out. Kelle’s grin grows wider as the sound of water dripping fills the sudden silence. Prinn’s face is a combination of disgust and shame; it’s a shade of red deeper than being tongue-twisted speaking to a girl. Kelle intentionally sprays a little to the side of Prinn’s head, making sure to get some on his ears and cheeks. You watch, helpless to help your friend.\n\nKelle ends with a shake. “Next time I’ll save some for you.” The deed done, the fighting over, the victors apparent, the two goons gather themselves and limp to Kelle. They suffered more damage than you or Prinn, but sometimes victory isn’t by raw damage alone. A defeated morale makes for an easy opponent, it’s the wind taken from their sails, the breath from full lungs. You don’t really know what to say. There are no words that are comforting in a situation such as this. All you can do is offer Prinn a hand to his feet.\n\nPrinn meets your eyes, and you see a look you’ve never seen in the boy’s face. It’s the face of an adult that learns he’s unable to provide food for his family, the face of a slave facing the gallows, the face of a boy who just was pissed on in full view of his best friend. The constant jokes, even when inappropriate, are long gone. The book-smart intelligence, top of the class smarts, served him no purpose in a fist fight, the grim reality of that fact settles on Prinn’s face. His name may be at the top of the list, but the boy himself is vulnerable.\n\n“Never again,” he whispers.\n\nThe tunnel opens through a small door, about half the size of a man, hidden by shrubbery at the base of a small creek. Bright green, though slightly dulled by the low light, bursts into your vision. At least there aren’t any ladders. Scoutleader Prinn shuts the door and pulls a padlock from the inside of his cloak. First a key, then a lock--you wonder what else is hidden inside. The creek is almost peaceful. Water runs (the shame on his face) at a comforting level, the kind that soothes a child to sleep. Smooth white stones peek through the top of the water, their size revealing to the water’s depth, grassy moss spreading across the surface of each.\n\n“Is it safe to have such a tunnel lead into the garrison?” you ask.\n\n“And the trespasser would do what? Lock himself in jail?” Prinn answers, the humor from his voice long gone--by many years if you had to guess.\n\n“Yeah, forget the obviously unguarded entry into your fort,” you utter to yourself. Both men ignore the comment.\n\nPrinn looks towards the canopy. “We haven’t much time. I hope you’re ready to put that thing to use.”\n\nRedding flips the dagger in his palm. “More than.”\n\n“Very good. This way then.”\n\nYou follow the route that Prinn climbs, stepping on the same stones as you leave the creek behind. In another time, it would be a relaxing place to spend an afternoon, especially with the company of ale and a woman. But now that’s the furthest thing from your mind. Back in the New World wilderness, you find yourself wishing that you weren’t given the crimson tunic of Magda. For one, it sticks out like a soldier in the wrong formation. For two, the long Alteran overcoat is better suited for the elements.\n\nThrough the forest you go, led by the scoutleader. It’s hard not to notice the way he carries himself in the environment opposed to Redding, for example. It’s less of a military march, more of a casual stroll. Part of it could be that there are only three of you, not an entire company of soldiers, but you imagine Prinn would have the same manner whether he were alone or had a thousand men behind him. Comfortability. Ease. Prinn travels as if the forest were his bunkhouse. Being a scout, that’s often the case.\n\nAs you continue, the sounds of battle fade back into existence. They start light, like footsteps off in the distance growing louder with each step forward. “We’re going to flank an entire war party as three men?” you whisper. Prinn turns, and for the first time since you’ve seen him, he has the semblance of a smile. It’s not quite yet a grin, however. Just the beginning of one. Prinn simply points up towards the canopy above.\n\nYou glance up to find 13, maybe 15 pairs of eyes staring back at you. They’re at least several stories up. Like their scoutleader, the rest of the Magda scouts wear a forest green cloak and carry bows. Unknowing to you, they had been escorting you the entire way, lightly jumping between tree branches. Still, the fact remains.\n\n“We’re going to flank an entire war party as fifteen men?” you adjust your questioning.\n\n“Not quite. We’re going to shadow them to their camp. We haven’t been able to find where they travel from. I’ve been all over the area, and there’s no sign of their tribes, not to mention an entire war party, stopping anywhere.”\n\n“The dagger is bait,” Redding says. “You knew the Blackbirds would be upset by our...claim of the artifact.”\n\nThe scoutleader nods. “And we assumed, right, that they would send numbers to retrieve it. We’ve pulled them out of hiding, and they’ll take us back to their camp. Then they’ll face the full might of Magda.”\n\n“Then why are we here?” you ask. “If it’s the artifact the Blackbirds want, then it’s out here, exposed, far from the safety of the fort. We aren’t trackers, nor expert woodsmen. It seems risky to include us on a mission you’re more than capable of handling yourselves.”\n\n(Such boldness. Never afraid to speak your mind, are you?)\n\n“Captain Alexander thought it best,” Prinn says with a sigh. “You might wear the colors of Magda, but there may still be questionable feelings among the soldiers. I heard about your run-in with the lieutenant, Benjamin.”\n\n“But still,” you answer. “The dagger is bait. Usually with bait a trap is waiting to be sprung. We’re exposed,” you say for a second time.\n\n“Orders are orders,” Prinn replies. Besides, the war party is currently busy throwing themselves at the garrison. They’ll be too distracted, with their tails tucked between their legs, to be aware of us. Enough talk. We draw close.”\n\nNo more words are shared. The three of you, along with the scouts above, creep forward, taking extra caution now that you’re near to the Blackbird war party. You use the overgrowth to your advantage, never stepping out into the open air. There’s always another area of cover to hide behind, and you allow yourself to bounce between cover to cover. Wind rustles through the trees, the creaking of branches holding against the unseen element, sounding not unlike the way a galleon settles into the water. Now that you\u0027re aware of them, you recognize the sound as the scouts, although the tiny sound they make blends in with the environment.\n\nYou can almost make them out through the trees now. Shadowy figures standing taller than any Alteran, their backs turned towards you. Their armor is crude. It’s a kind of leather far thinner than the one you currently wear. You wonder how fearsome a Blackbird would be donned in full plate, swords and arrows useless against the heavy armor. Luckily, their “armor” can barely be classified as such. Tromping through the forest, you understand why, not to mention they probably have no engineers or inventors like a civilized society boasts.\n\nSuddenly, a pair of boots lands between the three of you, a whirl of green follows like a flag raised to the top of a pole. One of Prinn’s scouts.\n\n“Sir, the Blackbirds…”\n\n“The Blackbirds what, soldier?” Prinn narrows his eyes.\n\n“They’ve broken through the main gate.”\n\n(Out of the frying pan, into the war party?)\n\n“Gods,” Prinn curses.\n\n“Orders, sir?”\n\n“There’s no sense in learning of their camp’s location if there is no garrison to counter attack. We come to their aid.”\n\n“The fifteen of us?” you interject.\n\n“Sixteen, actually,” Prinn corrects. It doesn’t bring any relief.\n",
  "page 79": "Through your bloodlust, you’re still able to think clearly. You’ll not allow emotion or a false sense of honor take you into certain death, which is guaranteed if you attempt to cut your way to Alexander. You’ve amounted no small measure of success with the war party’s back turned towards you; facing them directly, you’re simply sixteen men against hundreds. It’s not pretty, it won’t be written down in warrior tales, but you prefer life to a “glorious” death on the battlefield.\n\nYou turn and run for the treeline. Arrows whizz past your face. Your heart stops for a moment, your mind screams at you to duck, find cover, flatten yourself on the ground, hands in front of head. The scouts, between you and the treeline, have another volley of arrows ready to fire, and you’re running straight towards them. Fourteen bows drawn in your direction, fourteen razor sharp arrowheads pointed at you--it doesn’t settle the mind, to say in the least. Like a hornet flying near, the worst thing you can do is react, swat at it, so you try to force the image from your mind, though it wanders a little, imagining what it’d feel like if one scout misfired.\n\nLike a gentle breeze against your skin, you actually feel one of the arrows fly dangerously close to your face. Still, you keep your sprint towards the trees. The horn rings through the air again, and more soldiers cheer over the sound of battle, a triumphant roar unified as one. Your sword in one hand, the other pumping, propelling your body forward, the sound of your breath a steady cadence in the chaos of war, you enter back into the jungle. The scouts let loose another volley before entering; they take to the trees, including Prinn, leaving Redding and you alone on the ground.\n\nYou take the opportunity to glance back. Through the flaming hole in the gate, the Magda garrison is managing to drive the Blackbirds from within. Instead of the native warriors pouring through, now, crimson-colored, steel breastplate soldiers march forward in tight formation, their shields creating an impenetrable defense, leaving the natives at mercy from the archers firing on the ramparts. Whatever power causes the blast in the fort isn’t using it on the soldiers, who would be at their mercy. The Blackbirds are split. Some continue to attack, throwing themselves recklessly against the well-armed soldiers, some sprint for the treeline, same as you. That’s more than enough motivation for you. You turn back and keep running, following the exact trail Redding sets before you.\n\nThe journey is familiar. Redding seems to be heading in the direction in which you came, to the small creek and tunnel back to the garrison. The rest is a blur of tree trunks, overgrowth, and dirt. Your vision is mostly down to step exactly on Redding’s bootprints. The man keeps a quick pace for someone who is several years your elder. Redding has never been one to solve problems by physical means, but now you’re starting to think he could if he preferred, which is surprising, but not nearly as surprisingly as everything else you’ve found out recently about the man. Your mind briefly wanders from thoughts of Redding to the company. The garrison took significant damage, and you hope that didn’t extend to the dungeon. If you are heading back to the tunnel, perhaps you can check on them.\nA little while later you’re back at the creek. Smooth stones, moss crawling on top, the gentle sound of running water. Peaceful, almost, your bloodstained hands and body disturbing the serenity. Redding’s sitting on a stone, drinking out of his waterskin. You collapse on a stone of your own, but not before splashing a few handfuls of cold water on your face, a refresher as good as any.\n\n“Well, that didn’t go as planned,” you break the silence, dryly. It’s all you can think of saying.\n\n“Didn’t it?” Redding questions in his usual manner.\n\n“You know after all we went through to claim that dagger of yours, I thought it’d have more of an impact.”\n\nThe humor leaves Redding’s tone. “Me too, kid. Something’s wrong with it. Its power is dormant. It’s there within. I can feel it. But it didn’t awaken. It should have once tasting blood.”\n\n“You owe me answers,” you say, directly.\n\n“That I do,” Redding agrees.\n\n“Starting with these,” you gesture at the crimson tunic underneath your leather armor. “Tell me why the hell we wear the colors of the High King’s rival.” Your passion, your anger rises. It happens during combat, and it happens in conversation. “Tell me why you, we, betrayed the company and they sit locked up, maybe dead after the Blackbird breach. Tell me why the FUCK we are traitors to Alteran and can never go home again, or else the noose will greet us rather than family and friends.”\n\n“Fair enough,” Redding says. He takes a gulp in preparation. The running water of the creek fills the silence for a moment as if begging you to stop fighting. “The Old ways are dying. You know that. The ways of the High King and Alteran are quickly becoming obsolete. The days of blindly following the chain of command, government, superiors--whatever--are passing away. Think back to the night before our departure for the New World, to the tavern with billboards covered in Alteran propaganda. Is the New World anything like you were promised?”\n\nHe actually waits for you to shake your head before continuing again.\n\n“The Old World is built on rules, laws, and regulations. Structure is in place to suppress the free thinking individual. The Alteran citizens are told who to hate, who to love, never allowed to think for themselves. The ‘rules’ of war are bullshit. It’s a way of keeping conflicts going, while preserving the lives of soldiers so citizens never learn the reality of war. All that is rendered obsolete with the discovery of the New World. This is a place for a man’s life to be his own. There is endless possibility, endless wealth. And what do the High King and Supreme Leader Fargrave, both, want? To apply the rules of the Old to the New. See, they seek to claim the New World as an extension of their own. Their interests are aligned in that regard. When it comes to the New World, they are more ally than enemy.”\n\nYou spit on the ground, a reaction caused by years of conditioning. Comparing the High King to his rival is like someone telling you a pot of boiling water isn’t hot and it’s safe to place a hand inside. “So then aiding Magda, turning coat, is no different by that logic. If you take issue with serving the High King in the New World, then serving the Supreme Leader is exactly the same. If both their interests are aligned, then either way you’re bringing the Old to the New.”\n\nThe Redding grin creeps slowly to the corner of his lips. “And who says I’m serving Fargrave?”\n\nOnce again you motion towards your tunic.\n\n“Means to an end,” Redding says. “Now I know the location of both Alteran and Magda in the New World, safely uncovered the artifact, discovered a secret entrance into the Magda fort, and once Scoutleader Prinn and his green cloaks return, I’ll know the location of the Blackbird war party’s camp. If there’s one thing you should take from all of this, it’s that my allegiance is to the individual. I sense it’s largely the same for you, despite the High King’s attempt at brainwashing. I’ve seen how you’re different from the others. You know that I’m right. I may be breaking the laws of the two most powerful nations in the world, New or Old, rendering myself an enemy and fugitive of the state, but it’s all for the greater good. Together, we can sever the ties of the Old World and ensure they don’t bind the New World.”\n\nSo that’s why. Originally you had thought Redding chose you because he knew of your past with Magda, but instead, it’s due to your ability to think for yourself. Since he mentioned it, your mind goes to the tavern, the night before departing for the New World. You were off by yourself questioning the posters encouraging the Alteran citizen to enlist into the military. That, in addition to your aim with a flintlock and strength with the sword, made you a likely candidate to join Redding’s Free Thinking Army. That all makes sense. The artifact, however, is still a question mark.\n\n“The artifact,” you say. “How did you learn about it?”\n\n“Let’s just say a certain Alteran messenger ‘lost’ a very important parchment meant for Captain Briggs, one that told the story of a hidden weapon buried in Blackbird ceremonial crypts or something like that. A mysterious weapon that could turn the tide of the war? Alexander was more than willing to offer his support and aid in the matter. Means to an end. Truthfully, it’s rather disappointing, but at the very least it’ll serve as a symbol between us and the Blackbirds. Until I learn to draw on its power, of course.”\n\n“Your ‘symbol’ is in the shape of a target on our backs,” you point out. “You summoned an entire war party by disrupting the burial place.”\n\n“Ahh, that’s not the case for all tribes. Some will join the cause of the wielder. The Old World’s poison is affecting the Blackbirds too. They’ve been united under a single leader. This dagger,” he pulls it from its sheath, “will separate them from their collective thinking. They believe it is sacred, you see. Above any chieftain or priest.”\n\nYou entertain pointing out that they’d be leaving, “blindly following,” one authority for another. Redding isn’t a leader in that sense. Despite his secrets and ulterior motives, you can’t imagine him wielding the dagger simply to rule the Blackbird tribes. If anything, they are a means to an end in his own words. Before you can speak again, footsteps approach. Prinn and the scouts return.\n\n“Back so soon--” you start, then cut off. Encircling the creek is not Prinn and the green cloaks, but a small band of Blackbird warriors. Their weapons are drawn, crude axes and spears. They stand a full head taller than you, donned in simple leather too thin to be considered armor. Ashen war paint covers their face and bodies, giving them a ghastly appearance; these warriors have accepted death already. They are spirits wandering the forest, causing death in their wake on their way to their eventual end. Their destination is the afterlife, and they mean to take as many along with them.\n\n“Finished asking questions?” Redding says, rising to his feet, sword in hand.\n\n“For now,” you answer, pulling your longsword from your back, the weight of the blade familiar in your hands. The creek, again, protests in the background.\n\nOne of the Blackbird warriors steps forward. You count eight of them in total, eight warriors who are very much aware of your presence. Mentally you take a note of the creek and stones that would potentially trap or trip you up. Some will also separate their superior number into one, maybe two at a time. “You disturb what is not yours, tek’usan.”\n\n(No argument here.)\n\nYou’re unfamiliar with the word, but you know an insult when you hear one. They speak common. Strange.\n\n“You know our language,” you address him.\n\n“You are not the first to travel across the Great Sea. You will not be the last.” The warrior speaks with a heavy accent. Each word is articulated slowly and deliberately, it’s own, not the smooth cursive speech of an Alteran. The Blackbird woman you encountered alone in the forest days ago didn’t appear to speak common, although perhaps she didn’t want to reveal that she understood your language. The warrior continues. “You have invaded our land and not come in peace. You will return to your ancestors.”\n\nThat you do understand. There’s no avoiding what comes next. Now is as good a time as any for Redding to discover the power hidden within the dagger. Otherwise he might not get another chance. With a cry, they attack. Their voices are loud, an attempt to posture, intimidate and affect your sword arm. You’re no recruit. The tactic is obvious. Snarling, you meet their attack with your own. You both speak common, and yet the incoherent words of battle are understood far greater than any words you might have shared.\n\nTwo jump down near to your position, their axes at the ready. You feel the weight of your flintlock holstered at your thigh. (Not yet.) Best to save it if you need a quick resolution. For now you’ll test their expertise in melee. You start with a series of slashes, using the length of your longsword to keep them at bay. You’re careful to keep it technical, however. The last thing you need is to get into a strength match with two warriors far larger than you. Taking the offensive, you don’t allow them the opportunity to get in attacks of their own, unless they’re willing to risk a cut sneaking through their attempts to block. Cut left, then right, lunge forward, feint high then cut low. The series taught by a former teacher speaks in your head, simultaneously, while you perform the technique perfectly, which would earn you the approval of your teacher, but in this case you’re content with the felling of two opponents.\n\nTwo down. Six to go. Two engage Redding, leaving four more for you.\n\nThey mean to overwhelm you first, then Redding. Taking you out of the equation means they can focus their attention on the one bearing the dagger, keeping Redding busy in the meantime. You hop between stones. Tiny streaks of water kick up in the air, trailing from your boots, followed by the heavy splashing of the large Blackbirds. They chase, their speed not on equal levels as one warrior reaches you first. You greet him by turning on your heel, thrusting your longsword backward. The point hits the warrior mid swing, his axe raised high overhead. For an instant you make eye contact. You don’t see the savage, uncivilized barbarian that the stories of Alteran tell. Instead, you see a man, the utter realization of reaching the end of his life.\n\nThree more for you.\n\nClick. Before they can reach you with their spears, your flintlock is in your hand, hammer cocked back. Your hand is steady, like that of a surgeon. You stare down the doubled-barrel, lining it up with the quickly approaching warriors. One second you see them, the next black smoke crowds your vision, the smell of gunpowder, the smell of death. Click. Your second shot fires where the second target would be, despite your inability to see. The smoke clears. Two bodies lie facedown in the creek, staining the crystal water with red streaks.\n\nOne.\n\nBehind the native, you can see Redding isn’t as successful. The two warriors engaging him must be a higher caliber than the ones sent your way. Redding swings with far less discipline that you’ve come to expect of the man, untraditional tactics or not. Something’s wrong. With his next maneuver, you see it. A dark pool at his side, underneath his arm. A wound suffered at the gate, hidden by the crimson tunic and a good card player’s face. However, all bets are off. There’s no bluffing the hand dealt, in this case, a compromised sword arm and a short amount of time.\n\nYou barely have enough time to block. The swing of the last native’s axe hits your sword at the last moment. The strength of the blow sends you falling backwards, not having time to set your feet. Your flintlock flies from your hand and bounces off two stones before landing in the water. Luckily, you hold onto your longsword. Water splashes in the air, soaking your boots completely through, the last of your worries. The warrior approaches. Drops of water spill from your hilt as you raise your sword defensively. Steel greets stone, the impact felt through the thin grip you keep at the hilt, echoing throughout the length of your arms.\n\n(It’s time.)\n\nA startled cry erupts from Redding’s mouth in a sound that would normally be humorous. Given the present situation, it’s more along the lines of a dog’s yelp when beaten with a stick. Suddenly, the remaining Blackbird warriors pause as if a frigate pulling up her sails and dropping anchor. The dagger in Redding’s hand glows ravenlight, the same black purple hue from navigating the halls of the dead, followed by a dark fog of black smoke, like small thunderclouds encircling the dagger’s blade.\n\nIt flies from Redding’s hand, pulled by some unseen force and flips several times in the air, blade over hilt, before landing squarely in your open palm, the very hand that dropped the flintlock not seconds before.\n\n(Dormant power, he says. my power has never been more alive.)\nWho--\n(Yes, yes. Who are you? What are you? How did you...? Let’s not waste our time with meaningless questions. I do believe there is someone else that wants your attention, yes?)\n\nThe dagger pulls your arm up, leaving behind a trail of dark smoke, blocking the swing of the Blackbird who has since recovered. Teeth gritted, jaw clenched, he appears to be furied by the dagger’s action, rather than showing reverence towards the “sacred” artifact. You wonder if he’d feel the same if he heard the voice it spoke through…\n\n(Ready? I don’t really care either way.)\n\nThe very blade of the artifact grows in length. One moment it’s a dagger, the next it’s the size of a short sword. (That’s better. Like stretching your legs after a long nap.) You wonder how the voice knows what that’s like. A problem for another time. The next motion of the artifact is by your own strength, the sudden growth of metal giving the warrior in front of you pause. The black blade rips through the warrior’s axehead, leather clothes underneath, and stops halfway through his torso, giving him the appearance of a tree suffering wounds from a lumberjack just before toppling over. Not a second later, the warrior does just that.\n\n(You seem hesitant. Let me help ease your mind into things.)\n\nThe dark blade retracts back to dagger size, and keeps compressing. A flash of ravenlight, followed by black smoke. Then, familiarity. In your palm, not lies a short sword or dagger, but the grip of a flintlock. Well, not exactly a flintlock, although the weapon bears the same basic shape. A cylinder chamber rests just above the trigger and the barrel, a single one, is much shorter in length. It displays the same shade of black, and the handle has two carved wings at the tips, just as the dagger did.\n\n(Go on. try me. I know you want to.)\nWell...if you insist.\n\nRedding and his two enemies stand still, transfixed at the weapon changing shape within your very hands, the former corporal with his mouth gaping wide open. Might as well test out the strange gun that the artifact shaped for you. Its weight is light, far beyond that of your flintlock. You raise it to a firing position, surprising yourself with how quickly it draws. In a fraction of the time it takes to aim the flintlock, the artifact fires twice, the second shot coming nearly simultaneously, the effect of slamming your left hand down on the hammer before seeing the result of the first.\n\nRavenblack smoke. Two Blackbirds drop with a thud. The smell of the smoke is nothing like the gunpowder you’re used to. It’s somehow sweet, providing the smallest hints of vanilla and tobacco. Eight bodies stain the once peaceful creek, weapons strewn out, limbs displayed in angles only the dead would keep. For the second time, you grab a few handfuls of water and splash it on your face. Redding needed to learn how to activate the artifact’s power. Well, it’s dormant no longer. As if knowing he crossed your mind, Redding slumps down against a stone, leaning his weight against it to limit his own energy expenditure, even for something as little as holding posture.\n\nVoice?\n(Yes?)\nCare to explain?\n(Haven’t you had enough questions and killing for today?)\nNot nearly enough.\n(Another time.)\n\nYou think the voice--the artifact--sounds playful there.\n\n(I think your friend needs medical attention more than you need answers.)\n\nYou rush to Redding’s side to access the damage. The man is breathing through ragged breath, clutching his torso. Through his cupped hand that covers the wound, you see red starting to pour through. Without speaking, you calmly remove his hand to see. The wound appears to be from a spear, judging by the size and entry point. An axe would have broken a few ribs on impact and left a far greater cut. A miniature waterfall of blood pours out as soon as you check, so you instantly place Redding’s hand back. The artifact, which seems to have sensed your next thought, resumes back to a dagger, one that you use to cut a strip of cloth from Redding’s tunic. You use it as a field tourniquet. It’ll have to do until you return back to the garrison.\n\nThe garrison...is that truly your next destination? It has to be. It’s the closest means to find real medical help. Frontrunner’s Camp is too far away, even if you could convince the Alterans that you were set upon by Blackbirds. The story would hold up long enough for Redding to be treated. POW transfers take some time, after all.\n\nAny way you can shape into something to help treat the man?\n\n(Do I look like a tool used for healing?)\n\n“So that’s why it wasn’t working for me,” Redding utters through a cough. He spits on the ground, adding more blood stains to the creek. “Kid, you now wield the power to turn the tide.”\n\n(Great. Another mortal to bend me to his will. Heard that story before.)\n\n“Do you know anything about the origin of its power?” you ask. “It’s like there’s a...living being inside.”\n\n“Hearing voices?”\n\n“No, just one.”\n\nRedding tries to laugh, but all he manages is more blood through a fit of coughing. “Damn it, that’s funny.”\n\nWithout missing a beat, you say, “Then your condition must be far worse than I thought. Come on, I’ll get you to the garrison.”\n\n“I’m in no position to move. And those green cloaks are out there somewhere. You’re better off going on without me.”\n\n“But there could be more Blackbirds wandering around.”\n\n“I’ll take cover in the tunnel until you return. I’m going to let you in on a little secret.” You physically move your head closer as if there are listening ears nearby. “The artifact can change into more than just weapons.”\n\n(The old man’s right, you know.)\nShush.\n\n“I see where this is going,” you comment, stepping towards the hidden door. It’s locked shut with the padlock that Prinn pulled from his cloak earlier. It’s high quality, but like any lock the mechanism inside will give way if you manipulate the tumblers just right, something a skilled thief can do with a set of tools. There’s no need for lockpicks. The solution is clear.\n\nSo, uh, how does this work?\n(Close your eyes and count to three. Dream really, really, really big now.)\n…\n(Alright, fine. And here we go!)\n\nThunderclouds. Smoke. Instead of a dagger in your hand, a black key appears. Sure enough, it fits the padlock perfectly. Neat trick, one that you plan to use in the future. It’s not that you find yourself facing locked doors often, but now that’ll never be the case. You help Redding to his feet and support him with one arm. It’s slow going. Eventually, you leave him just inside the door.\n\n“I’ll be back in no time,” you say. “Hang tight. The surgeons will no doubt have their hands full today.” You flip the key in the air, willing it to change back into a dagger. Mid-flight, the increasingly familiar black smoke appears, and a dagger lands in your palm. “I’m sure this thing will help persuade any uptight field physician.”\n\n“Don’t return without a jug of ale,” Redding says.\n\n(Don’t even think about it.)\n\nYou’ve used up enough time already. Redding’s card face returns, but the damage has been done. He’s in bad shape, truthfully. You roughly estimate he has a day left without treatment. The hidden door shuts behind you, causing Redding to be exactly that. The signs of your earlier violence greets you upon entering back into the creek. It’s not the first peaceful place to be stained by battle, and it sure as hell won’t be the last. You best get moving.\n",
  "page 78": "With the Magda forces gathering, you’re safer off rejoining with them. The only issue is that it’s through an entire Blackbird war party. You’ve gained no small amount of success, however, and press on. With the scouts behind you firing arrows, you continue the momentum forward, cutting through the forces like a spearpoint finding a gap armor. The Blackbird warriors are great in size, yes. But they lack the precision and efficient movements of an Alteran or Magda soldier.\n\nYou keep cutting onward to the gate, reloading the flintlock between short gaps of opponents. Soon, the time between is growing less and less. You’re barely able to finish one warrior before the next is standing in his place, often more than one. The momentum halts. Instead of driving the spear into the armor gap tearing into flesh, it finds sturdy chainmail underneath.\n\nHeavy swing of axes, stabbing of spears. They rise in frequency to sheer physical impossibility to defend against them all. Not two minutes into attempting to cut your way to the garrison, a spear makes its way past your defenses, and unlike the aforementioned analogy, there is no chainmail underneath. Pain shoots throughout your body, originating from the wound between your chest and shoulder. Instantly, your left arm loses its strength, and you’re forced to wield your longsword with just your right.\n\nFirst things first. You chop down with your longsword, snapping the spear shaft into two pieces, the point side still sticking from your torso. Next, you slice low, running the edge of your blade against the Blackbird’s thigh. As he drops, unable to support his weight, you imitate the maneuver to his throat. He falls. Two more take his place, and they sense blood.\n\nGritting your teeth, more primal sounds humming within, you don’t allow them to attack. Instead, you take it for yourself, charging forward swinging the longsword more frantically than before, urgency screaming in your brain. The spear still sticks from your chest like a small sapling in a clearing. Two warriors stand in your way, one wielding two axes, the other a spear. They hungrily await your attack.\n",
  "page 71": "Invaders. Trespassers. Defiliers.\n\nThey came on large wooden horses from across the Great Sea. The goddess of the sea must be angry with her people if she carried the invaders on her waters safely. She is not one to be crossed, the Sea Goddess. Her favor is as fleeting as the ocean breeze, one moment a comforting escape from Father Sun’s heat, the next a whirlwind of destruction. Some of his people, the Harri’ar, carved such horses for themselves, canoes of tremendous size. Their ambition is--was--their downfall. The Raven brings content; they paid for their blasphemy.\n\nLike the trespassers soon will. The stories of old told of such things, a different type of man trespassing on the Harri’ar, greed as their deity, murder in their hearts. According to the stories, ones told by the fire from a young age, they were defeated and driven from the land. Sent west. Father Sun, in his cyclical motion across the sky, bound the timeline of mortals to a wheel. It spins and spins, eventually returning back to where it\u0027s been before. There is nothing new. All has happened before and will happen again.\n\nThe defilers were driven from the land before, and they will be driven from the land again. The Raven will see to it.\n\nEl’ek, son of El’ekana, gathers at the treeline with the others. A war party! One has not been called in many moon cycles. Their favor with Father Sun is growing. The high priests were blessed with the Father’s flame, raining down upon the most recent pack of wooden horses, sending a few to spend an eternity with the Sea Goddess. El’ek sends a silent prayer to the Father above, through the thick forest canopy, for His good will to continue. An abomination stands before the war party, a fortress built and tied together from the fallen corpses of the Earth Mother’s children. Mother will sacrifice some for the good of the Harri’ar, but the proper burial rites must be spoken, the proper prayers offered in gratitude.\n\nHis chieftain wills him forward, one of many in the war party, guided by the high priests in their knowledge and wisdom of the Raven. Their prayers have been answered, guidance brought by the divine. The war party will see victory today. There is no doubt of that. The invaders, trespassers, defiliers, they may possess great weapons and technology, but they are powerless without it. The Harri’ar are strong. They do not need such aid when it comes to battle. Their strength lies in the swing of the axe, the stab of the spear--and the Raven.\n\nThe sky, once filled with a thick canopy, is now filled with arrows. A shadow falls over the Harri’ar warriors. Stupid outsiders. The darkness is where the Harri’ar live, their entire lives spent under rampant overgrowth. What may hinder “soldiers” across the Great Sea, is an annoyance, at best, to the Harri’ar. El’ek, among the warriors, feels no fear. He is under the Raven’s protection. Like raindrops bouncing from a flat leaf, the arrows stop before piercing through the Veil. The high priests, led by Terr’ok, have brought the war party under the safety of the Raven’s wing. Projectiles stop before getting through--most of them at least. A few make it through, felling several Harri’ar warriors, a fraction of the death that would be caused without the Veil.\n\nInvaders. Trespassers. Defilers.\n\nThey think they are safe behind their walls. They are wrong.\n",
  "page 70": "Private First Class Erikkson surveys the scene in front of him, arrow nocked, bowstring yet undrawn. His first tour, here in the New World, is nothing like he expected. For one, there’s no glory. He imagined triumphantly marching through cities, citizens lined on the streets cheering, offering gifts, fathers their daughters. That’s what the recruiter promised, is it not? Instead, he’d been stuck on a boat for weeks, stomping through the forest, and standing post and the very same spot on the ramparts. He’s memorized every notch in the wood wall, each scratch, scuff mark, blackened torch burn. And now, shadowy figures appear in front of the garrison, seemingly out of nowhere. PFC Erikkson shutters to think if the scoutleader didn’t warn the garrison in time--they likely would have been overrun.\n\nThe bow in his hand feels heavier than it did yesterday. Erikkson is aware of the bowstring against his fingers. It’s rougher today, foreign almost. As suddenly as the natives showed up on their doorstep, all moisture evaporates from his tongue. It sticks to the top of Erikkson’s mouth, dry and rough. Erikkson swallows. It feels better, slightly.\n\nHis attention draws towards the letter tucked safely in his pocket underneath his steel breastplate. He’d read it countless times, long memorizing the single page of words. Hell, he had it memorized before stepping off the boat. Dear Milly. Sweet Milly. His wife. She was safely home in Magda tending to their two little ones. It brings a small level of comfort for a brief moment, but his military training soon takes over. The enemy is near. Focus on the present. A soldier with a wandering mind is as good as dead. The others around him wear stoic expressions, although Erikkson knows they are feeling the same. For many, it’s their first tour as well.\n\nOne moment he’s lost in his thoughts, the next the feather of his arrow is tickling his cheek. The command’s been issued, and subconsciously, PFC Erikkson follows in perfect unison with the others. In a single motion, no stragglers, his officer barks his orders, raising one arm simultaneously, the archers along the ramparts drawing their bows as one. The officer’s hand drops down. The arrows let loose.\n\nFor a moment, Erikkson loses sight of the Blackbird warriors. A sea of arrows fill his vision, a stormy wave bringing eminent death. Upon the wave’s subsiding, Erikkson startles. Where there should have been a clearing filled with Blackbird dead bodies, instead, is just a clearing filled with Blackbird warriors, very much still living. They don’t seem affected by the barrage of arrows. Still, they press on.\n\nFrom the edge of the treeline, the ones where Magda soldiers hadn’t cut yet, a different sort of native appears. It’s a small group, dressed in dark robes, fully-hooded, complete with carved wooden staves. They casually walk forward, like the way an elder would rise from an armchair to stoke the fireplace. Before Erikkson can give them a second thought, commands are barked. His officer\u0027s hand raises, and Erikkson draws another arrow.\n",
  "page 73": "Prinn leads you back down the switchback staircase. As your foot hits the last step, you hear the distinct sound of bowstring thwungs! a volley of arrows sent raining down on the gathering natives. If you didn’t experience the rough landing to the New World that you did, you would think them foolish and unprepared for the battle. From your brief glimpse on the ramparts, they didn’t appear to have any siege weapons with them, nor (ugh) ladders to scale the walls of the fort. Still, somehow they managed to sink Alteran vessels moving in the water. A stationary fort, though with strong walls, may be at the mercy of such firepower. And despite Magda’s well-equipped garrison, you didn’t see any cannons or counter-siege weapons of their own. They may have a defensive fort, but their power is severely lacking. An Alteran fort of this size would have no less than 10 guns pointing down the road to the single gate. Sticks and stones may break bones, but cannonfire puts an end to the discussion.\n\nBack through the main yard, past a few square buildings, Prinn silently leads you without a word. Redding doesn’t seem to be willing to break the silence either, likely both are listening to the battle sounds, determining the events by sound alone. Another thwung! A second volley is loosed at the natives. They’ll be cut down before even reaching the garrison walls. Finally, Prinn stops at an, uncoincidentally, square building. He opens the single door, and waves you inside.\n\nThe battle sounds are deadened here. It’s the top level of a jail. A lone Maga soldier sits behind a table next to a reinforced locked door. The soldier looks up upon your arrival, his face glowing orange from the single candle burning on the table, dangerously close to a thick ledger. If this is the dungeon where the company is being kept, it’s aptly named.\n\n“Appointment,” the guard speaks.\n\n“Prinn, Scoutleader, two guests,” Prinn states back.\n\n“Mhm. Mmhmm. Ah,” the guard scans the ledger with one finger, oblivious to the battle happening just outside the front door. “Here we are. Prinn, Scoutleader. Two guests.” The guard stands, a long drawn-out sigh escaping his lips. From his belt, he pulls a sizable keyring. You imagine if one more key were placed on the ring, it would burst apart. However, the guard pulls the exact one he’s looking for with the first draw. He unlocks the door, and like Prinn just moments ago, waves you inside.\n\n“Enjoy your stay. Two feet from the cells, please.”\n\nThe three of you enter the dungeon. You notice the door gets locked behind you. Worst comes to worst and you need a way out, it won’t be the way you just came. Somehow you think a “guest” doesn’t have much leverage behind locked doors. Prinn grabs a torch hanging on the wall, a normal burning one, unlike the one you carried in the halls of the dead. Shadows dance just out of reach as you’re led down the narrow corridor.\n\nCell doors pass on either side, the torch highlighting their barred frames. Most are empty. Some have thin creatures squatting in the corner, which you catch mere glimpses of, far away from the door itself. The dungeon is orderly, so much in fact that the High King might tip his crown to the way it’s run. Whoever resides here has long since been conditioned not to approach anyone walking out their door. Still, you don’t take any chances and keep more than an arm’s reach away.\n\nUpon reaching the final cell door, Prinn reaches inside his cloak and produces a key. It’s not one he gained from the jailer as you never saw them exchange any such thing. The cell creaks open, disturbing the ominous quiet, yet adding to the uneasy feeling that’s accompanying such a place as this. Prinn strides inside, and you can only keep following.\n\n“So this’s what’s become of you, eh?”\n\nYou turn to find Bastus leaning against his cell door, directly across from the one that Prinn opened. His beard is matted with some sort of liquid, too thick to be water. It’s been but a day, and yet the man looks entirely different than he did the previous morning. Only dressed in a loincloth, the large man looks thinner than before. Your mind tells you weight isn’t lost that easy, but your eyes see another story.\n\nYou choose your words carefully as Redding and Prinn are within listening distance. “I do as I must. That’s all any man can do.”\n\nLaughter spills from within the beard. It causes liquid to shake from Bastus’ chin, like a mongrel after retrieving a bone from a body of water. “The lie told by a traitor, the one he tells himself is true.”\n\nYou do not know what to say. Any defense will raise questions with Prinn and Redding. The thought briefly enters your mind that you could drop them now; the Alteran standard flintlock is double-barreled, after all. You could then lead the company back to Frontrunner’s Camp with the Magda garrison busy dealing with the Blackbirds.\n\nNo.\n\nFor the same reason you didn’t risk escape earlier. Bastus may be treated poorly, but his life isn’t at risk. The murder of two Magda members would set the garrison aflame with burning vengeance. They would hunt you down. Better to wait for the POW exchange. Do things the proper way. For now, you’ll just have to endure and carry on as normal.\n\n(Quite the young hero we have here. I wonder if they would do the same in your position.)\nDoesn’t matter.\n(Oh it matters, whether you’re willing to admit it or not.)\n\nAs you enter the cell, you leave Bastus with final words. “There is much that happens outside our narrow view.” You cross into the open doorway, Bastus cackling at your back, likely more liquid sprayed in the air. The cell is meant for one, maybe two prisoners. It’s empty, however, save for your two companions. Chains hang from the wall, a pair of them, answering the question of how many prisoners would occupy it. The walls are square stones. So far, the dungeon has been the only structure in the garrison built from more than lumber. Steel reinforced doors and cell walls; now stone, as the interior. Which begs the question, why are we--\n\n“You’re probably wondering why we’re here,” Prinn says, barely louder than a whisper, the voice two parents would make over a sleeping child. “There’s an escape route of sorts dug into these walls. It leads to an underground tunnel that will take us just beyond the assembling natives.”\n\n“I didn’t think the glorious scoutleader would be interested in running from a battle,” Redding digs.\n\n“You misunderstand,” Prinn answers, taking the opposite approach of Redding. “Which is the most effective way to swing a sword?”\n\nYou’ve heard the saying before. “When your enemy least expects it.”\n\nPrinn nods. “Exactly.” Then his eyes narrow. “Have we met before?”\n\nPanic floods through your body. As with any lie, the words must be spoken with full confidence. “I think I’d remember meeting a scoutleader in the Supreme Leader’s military.”\n\n“And I a turncoat to his country.”\n\n(Shouldn’t he be more happy with the color of your coat?)\nInfinitely so.\n(He meant it as an insult.)\nI’m well aware.\n(Why didn’t you tell him of your past?)\nThe company is within earshot. Besides, the past is the past. Besides, why am I answering you?\n(Because you’re used to me in your head.)\n\nNot a reassuring thought--words--whatever. You suppose the voice is right. It does feel more normal, at least as normal as a mysterious voice in your head can be. Hopefully the “conversations” stay normal, and you don’t have the voice tempting you to commit a deed that will end up putting your body in a place such as this, permanently.\n\nThe click of a switch, and one section of the wall reveals a small tunnel. Prinn goes first, Redding closely behind. As you enter, leaving the company behind locked up, you silently hope there aren’t any more ladders that await you, although reality has a funny way of spoiling the wine in your wineskin.\n",
  "page 72": "Invaders. Trespassers. Defiliers.\n\nThey came on large wooden horses from across the Great Sea. The goddess of the sea must be angry with her people if she carried the invaders on her waters safely. She is not one to be crossed, the Sea Goddess. Her favor is as fleeting as the ocean breeze, one moment a comforting escape from Father Sun’s heat, the next a whirlwind of destruction. Some of his people, the Harri’ar, carved such horses for themselves, canoes of tremendous size. Their ambition is--was--their downfall. The Raven brings content; they paid for their blasphemy.\n\nLike the trespassers soon will. The stories of old told of such things, a different type of man trespassing on the Harri’ar, greed as their deity, murder in their hearts. According to the stories, ones told by the fire from a young age, they were defeated and driven from the land. Sent west. Father Sun, in his cyclical motion across the sky, bound the timeline of mortals to a wheel. It spins and spins, eventually returning back to where it\u0027s been before. There is nothing new. All has happened before and will happen again.\n\nThe defilers were driven from the land before, and they will be driven from the land again. The Raven will see to it.\n\nEl’ek, son of El’ekana, gathers at the treeline with the others. A war party! One has not been called in many moon cycles. Their favor with Father Sun is growing. The high priests were blessed with the Father’s flame, raining down upon the most recent pack of wooden horses, sending a few to spend an eternity with the Sea Goddess. El’ek sends a silent prayer to the Father above, through the thick forest canopy, for His good will to continue. An abomination stands before the war party, a fortress built and tied together from the fallen corpses of the Earth Mother’s children. Mother will sacrifice some for the good of the Harri’ar, but the proper burial rites must be spoken, the proper prayers offered in gratitude.\n\nHis chieftain wills him forward, one of many in the war party, guided by the high priests in their knowledge and wisdom of the Raven. Their prayers have been answered, guidance brought by the divine. The war party will see victory today. There is no doubt of that. The invaders, trespassers, defiliers, they may possess great weapons and technology, but they are powerless without it. The Harri’ar are strong. They do not need such aid when it comes to battle. Their strength lies in the swing of the axe, the stab of the spear--and the Raven.\n\nThe sky, once filled with a thick canopy, is now filled with arrows. A shadow falls over the Harri’ar warriors. Stupid outsiders. The darkness is where the Harri’ar live, their entire lives spent under rampant overgrowth. What may hinder “soldiers” across the Great Sea, is an annoyance, at best, to the Harri’ar. El’ek, among the warriors, feels no fear. He is under the Raven’s protection. Like raindrops bouncing from a flat leaf, the arrows stop before piercing through the Veil. The high priests, led by Terr’ok, have brought the war party under the safety of the Raven’s wing. Projectiles stop before getting through--most of them at least. A few make it through, felling several Harri’ar warriors, a fraction of the death that would be caused without the Veil.\n\nInvaders. Trespassers. Defilers.\n\nThey think they are safe behind their walls. They are wrong.\n",

  "page 74": "Private First Class Erikkson surveys the scene in front of him, arrow nocked, bowstring yet undrawn. His first tour, here in the New World, is nothing like he expected. For one, there’s no glory. He imagined triumphantly marching through cities, citizens lined on the streets cheering, offering gifts, fathers their daughters. That’s what the recruiter promised, is it not? Instead, he’d been stuck on a boat for weeks, stomping through the forest, and standing post and the very same spot on the ramparts. He’s memorized every notch in the wood wall, each scratch, scuff mark, blackened torch burn. And now, shadowy figures appear in front of the garrison, seemingly out of nowhere. PFC Erikkson shutters to think if the scoutleader didn’t warn the garrison in time--they likely would have been overrun.\n\nThe bow in his hand feels heavier than it did yesterday. Erikkson is aware of the bowstring against his fingers. It’s rougher today, foreign almost. As suddenly as the natives showed up on their doorstep, all moisture evaporates from his tongue. It sticks to the top of Erikkson’s mouth, dry and rough. Erikkson swallows. It feels better, slightly.\n\nHis attention draws towards the letter tucked safely in his pocket underneath his steel breastplate. He’d read it countless times, long memorizing the single page of words. Hell, he had it memorized before stepping off the boat. Dear Milly. Sweet Milly. His wife. She was safely home in Magda tending to their two little ones. It brings a small level of comfort for a brief moment, but his military training soon takes over. The enemy is near. Focus on the present. A soldier with a wandering mind is as good as dead. The others around him wear stoic expressions, although Erikkson knows they are feeling the same. For many, it’s their first tour as well.\n\nOne moment he’s lost in his thoughts, the next the feather of his arrow is tickling his cheek. The command’s been issued, and subconsciously, PFC Erikkson follows in perfect unison with the others. In a single motion, no stragglers, his officer barks his orders, raising one arm simultaneously, the archers along the ramparts drawing their bows as one. The officer’s hand drops down. The arrows let loose.\n\nFor a moment, Erikkson loses sight of the Blackbird warriors. A sea of arrows fill his vision, a stormy wave bringing eminent death. Upon the wave’s subsiding, Erikkson startles. Where there should have been a clearing filled with Blackbird dead bodies, instead, is just a clearing filled with Blackbird warriors, very much still living. They don’t seem affected by the barrage of arrows. Still, they press on.\n\nFrom the edge of the treeline, the ones where Magda soldiers hadn’t cut yet, a different sort of native appears. It’s a small group, dressed in dark robes, fully-hooded, complete with carved wooden staves. They casually walk forward, like the way an elder would rise from an armchair to stoke the fireplace. Before Erikkson can give them a second thought, commands are barked. His officer\u0027s hand raises, and Erikkson draws another arrow.\n",
  "page 130": "They attempt to follow you into the tunnel. Quickly, they learn it’s certain death. The artifact fires true from your palm, its bullets always straight. Black smoke fills the tunnel, traveling towards the dungeon cell, the air closest. Bodies pile up. To stick one’s nose in the tunnel, even for a quick glance, is to risk losing the nose, an eye, or worse. Their numbers mean nothing here, and no one knows where the tunnel exits. None but Alexander, Prinn, and perhaps a few other key Magda members who aren’t the ones after you. Freedom is yours. Now you’ll just have to stitch Redding up in time without making the wound worse, although death is guaranteed if you don’t try, so there’s some small measure of reassurance there.\n\nYou can’t believe you made it. Into a fort blown to bits, occupied by the very army that labels you a traitor, escaping a prison suspended in the air, fighting your way through rows and rows of soldiers in formation, all while finding a surgeon’s needle and thread to save your friend and mentor. It’s almost too good to be true. Redding’s ever-contagious grin creeps along the corner of your lips, becoming more of a natural occurrence. It’s true what they say, taking on the mannerisms of those you’re close to. There are far worse traits to take on.\n\n(Is the action over already? I was just getting started!)\nFor now.\n(Awww.)\n\nYou press on. The footsteps and voices of the Alteran soldiers in pursuit have long faded away, bringing the only sounds in the tunnel of your own making. You’re not exactly hiding your presence--who would hear your approach in an enclosed space--but you have the mindset of a fugitive, of a criminal breaking out of prison, which, funnily-enough, is exactly what you’re doing, counting two escaped locked doors: the suspended cage and the dungeon itself. You try not to dwell on the sudden character shift of the artifact. It can sense your thoughts, which you’d rather remain a secret. One problem at a time. They seem to be piling up by the second, but a single one remains at the top of the list. Redding.\n\nA soft amount of light suddenly appears. You’re briefly entertained, inappropriately, by reaching the light at the end of the tunnel before remembering why you’re here in the first place. Although to be fair, it’s something that would have entertained Redding too. Will entertain him, you remind yourself. Your pace quickens now, careful not to scrape your head on the tunnel’s ceiling. Your head finding a jutting stone at nearly a run isn’t the ending that this story deserves. At least you procured a needle and thread to stitch yourself up if that’s what fate decides. Luckily, it doesn’t take the bait, and you manage to reach the light at the end of the tunnel, where the small hidden door lies. Redding should be right here...except he’s not.\n\nThe place where you left him is completely empty. There are small marks in the dirt where he sat. You need more light to inspect, so you crack the hidden door open for more natural light to spill through. Imprints on the dirt all right, smooth sections where his legs sat on the dirt, in contrast to the random arrangement of dust and dirt. You’re no tracker. You can’t judge the time frame, whether or not multiple bodies were here. If anything, you’d confuse your earlier marks and bootprints with an unknown assailant. Well, there’s one thing you know for certain. You just traveled down the other opening of the tunnel and didn’t run into Redding. There’s only one other direction he could have gone. Out the hidden door (the light at the end of the tunnel).\n\nOnce again you find yourself back at the creek for the third time. There, your lack of tracking ability is nullified. Redding is bound at the hands. A long trail of rope leads to his captor like a leash. Holding the opposite end of the rope, binding Redding to his fate is Prinn. He casually glances over his shoulder, noticing your appearance. He likely heard you long before exiting the tunnel, such are the skills of a woodsman, a scoutleader no less.\n\n“I was wondering when you would show up,” he comments, eyes focused on an object in his hands. His green cloak hides the object. Speaking of green cloaks, you don’t see the others, but that does not mean that they don’t see you. There are fourteen of them, something you mentally note in case things turn ugly.\n\n(Yeah! Turn them ugly, ugly.)\n\n“He needs medical attention,” you start, pulling the needle and thread from your pocket. As you rush towards the two, you catch sight of Redding’s wound, taken care of by Prinn. First aid, another skill set required of a woodsman.\n\n“As you can see, that’s already taken care of,” Prinn says in the manner of one swatting a fly from his dinner.\n\n“I can also see his hands are bound.”\n\n“How perceptive of you.” The dig gives you a flashback to your childhood and the boy who couldn’t help but hurl insults every chance he got. The adult in front of you is the furthest thing from the good-humored boy, despite the brief similarity in mannerism.\n\n“And why are they bound?” you ask.\n\n“Can’t you tell, kid?” Redding manges to say. You notice small sights of bruising appearing on his face. The freedom-speaking, government-abolishing Redding apparently didn’t take the bindings without a struggle. There probably wasn’t much of one in his condition. “The garrison fell, did it not?”\n\nAt this, both men turn to look at you. The lack of surprise on your face is telling enough. “How did you know?”\n\nPrinn says, “We lost track of the Blackbirds. They cover their tracks well. We’ll find their war camp. You can bet on that. After we lost the trail...”\n\n“...then you returned back to the garrison,” you finish.\n\n“Exactly. And discovered a thousand Alteran soldiers in occupation, the white flag and surrender hosting taking place. The true surprise came when I started to sneak back into the garrison through the tunnel.”\n\n“So what next?” you ask.\n\n“That depends,” Prinn answers. “What are the Alteran’s plans?”\n\nThere’s no point in withholding information. Besides, informing a Magda scoutleader is technically keeping alliances. “The garrison’s getting sent back to Magda. I’m uncertain when, but the men will be spared as long as they return to the Old World and never voyage back.”\n\n“That’s a traditional term of surrender during colonization,” Prinn comments. You’re already well-aware of that fact. “But the rules are different here. There is a common enemy within the trees of the forest. Magda and Alteran should not be squabbling together while a war party threatens our people.”\n\n“That sounds good and all, but there’s no convincing the commanding officers,” you say, feeling Redding’s gaze of approval. Might as well keep going. “They’re only concerned with beating their leader’s rival in the New World and gaining credibility and climbing rank. The Blackbirds are an afterthought, a nuisance.”\n\n“You and I both know they’re more than that.”\n\n“No argument here. I’m not the one who needs to be convinced though.”\n\nPrinn scratches his chin in thought. “Hmm…”\n\nHmm.\n\nThe blond-headed boy scratches his chin in thought, feeling at imaginary whiskers. You both stand before Vladimir, your father’s man, his enforcer. For the first time you see the man clearly, noticing detail. Before, he was simply part of the background, like a horse carriage passing by in the street, a butler in a wealthy manor. His overcoat is of good quality brown thread, reaching nearly to his boots. Underneath is a pure white tunic, open at the top exposing a few chest hairs trying to escape. At his hip rests a long rapier, its handle intricately weaved of intertwining metal. Vladimir’s expression is firm. Fixed. Hardened. Some men see only the physical. Others, like Vladimir, see into the soul.\n\n“Do you know where you went wrong?” Vladimir asks.\n\nIt’s been a full week since the events with Kelle and his goons. Prinn didn’t speak to you for the first half. It took a few days from there to get him to his normal self. Normal self. There is something different about him now. It’s the difference after witnessing the gallows for the first time or surviving your first battlefield. The naive way of thinking, the one a child views reality through, is gone, replaced with a sense of the ugliness of life and the people who possess it. And he has you to thank for it.\n\n“I didn’t think through the plan well enough,” you answer, child-sized hands clasped behind your back playing soldier.\n\n“No,” Prinn interjects. “We didn’t plan thoroughly enough.”\n\nVladimir nods, finding the answer that he’s looking for. “Fixed on revenge, you didn’t account for what happens after it was achieved. So focused on getting back at Kelle that you allowed him to return fire. Revenge. Ambush. When you take your enemy down, be sure that he can’t rise up again.”\n\n“I won’t make that mistake again,” you reply, again taking the fault on your own shoulders. Is that what you’re really doing though? Or are you planning to leave Prinn behind on your next attack? Of course your singular speech draws Prinn’s attention.\n\n“We won’t.”\n\n“Is that what you want, then? To try again with Kelle?” Vladimir questions.\n\nBoth of you answer with an emphatic “Yes!”\n\n“You may find that revenge doesn’t solve your problems. If there are things you seek to bury, revenge won’t keep them underground.”\n\n“It’s not a long-term fix,” Prinn admits. “But it’s a hell of a field tourniquet.”\n\nUpon his answer, Vladimir rolls back his head in laughter, the same kind that you’d expect at a busy tavern. “Ha ha ha. Alright then, young masters. Remember,” he grows serious, stern, rather quickly. “Don’t let any further disgrace fall on your father’s name.”\n\n“Yes, sir. ‘Don\u0027t embarrass your father. Don’t let anything stain his good name.’ I know, I know.” you answer.\n\nYour untrained eyes don’t register the movement until it’s too late. One moment Vladimir is leaning against the desk in his study, the next he’s crouching over your fallen body, knee putting pressure on your chest pinning you in place. Prinn knows better than to help. You can see it in his face. You made the bed; now you gotta lie in it.\n\n“It’s not a joke. It’s not a game,” Vladimir breathes fire. “I’m allowing this to happen only because Kelle needs to learn what crossing your family means. You won’t follow in your father’s political footsteps, that much is clear. There’s still hope for you, however, as an enforcer for your sister. Crossing your family means grave consequences. Better to have Kelle learn that at a young age.”\n\nVladimir’s head turns towards Prinn. “You. You’re the smart one here. Make sure our young master doesn’t do anything that will fall back on his father’s name, ok?” Prinn nods.\n\nFootsteps. The door to the study swings open without a single creak or settle, the only sound being the doorknob and gust of wind. Vladimir likes to keep his business well-oiled and practical. It’s your sister. She’s dressed in the robes of the school, marks on her arm signaling top rank in class. Your eyes meet for a split-second before she focuses solely on Vladimir.\n\n“Father needs you. There’s a...difficult client.”\n\n“I will come now,” Vladimir answers, removing his knee from your chest. He points a finger in your direction and again, he says, “Don’t let any further disgrace fall on your father’s name.” With that, he leaves you and Prinn alone in his study. He doesn’t warn against disturbing the place, messing with his desk and books like a normal adult would when leaving two children on their own. His possessions, and life, are owned by your father and by extension, you, despite your lack of authority in that regard. Your sister, however, doesn’t seem to mind giving orders. Then again, she’ll likely be the one taking over your father’s business.\n\n“Well,” Prinn says, offering a hand. “Anything comes to mind?”\n\n“A plan is starting to emerge” you answer. “One fully thought through.”\n\n“You mean thorough?”\n\n“Yeah, that’s what I meant.”\n\n---\n\nMaster Gavin’s lecture is running late. Odd for one as punctual as the teacher usually is. Must be on a roll, you think to yourself. He doesn’t like to stop the flow, even when going over time. You and Prinn wait outside in the hallway. The lecture hall is built from deep chestnut, shined and dusted to perfection. Crown molding lines the ceiling and floors. A few sculptures, faces carved reflecting previous teachers fill the opposite end of the room. Master Gavin likely aims to have his own sculpture one day, his academic career displayed in timeless stone.\n\nThe two of you wait outside. In a few moments students will pour from the lecture hall, Kelle being one of them. You’ve rehearsed the plan beforehand. You failed in physical altercation. Prinn is a liability in that regard. In verbal, however, you might just make a fool of Kelle in front of the other classmates, witnesses who will spread the tale and ensure Kelle doesn’t resort back to physical means.\n\nSuddenly, the double doors to the lecture hall burst open. Students pour through like a hole in a dam, ready to leave the lecture hall as they’re long overdue. They pass by you like water around two river stones. Then you see him. Kelle, without his two goons, surprisingly, not that they’d be able to help him out in something like you’re about to start. His eyes fix on you immediately, and a grin stretches across his face, no doubt remembering your previous encounter.\n\n“The runt and his braindead friend. Haven’t flunked out, have you?”\n\nHis adversarial words gather the attention of the other students. You notice they move slower now, listening to the conversation, but trying not to make it obvious.\n\n“Not yet,” you answer. “I was actually hoping you’d be able to help me out in that regard.”\n\n“Me? Help you? You can’t be serious,” Kelle answers.\n\n“Quite serious,” you say. “It’s no secret that you’re the smartest one in our class, even if you manage to perform poorly on your exams.”\n\nAs you were hoping, the backhanded compliment rings as an insult in Kelle’s ears, yet they could be considered friendly to the passerbyers.\n\n“I perform better than you,” Kelle replies. His face appears to be turning a shade of red. He, too, notices the others watching.\n\n“See?” you say to Prinn, emphasising your words by knocking on his shoulder lightly. “I told you he was smart. It’s surprising that you’re top rank, not Kelle.” Around you, you hear a snicker from a few students. Good. Let them make their presence even more known to Kelle. He’s a limit tester. Hit him once, he’ll hit twice back. Dump an old chamber pot on him, and he’ll piss on your face.\n\n“You better watch yourselves,” Kelle warns. You notice his hands are clenched into fists now. “I hear someone’s been stealing chamber pots and I’ve drank a lot of water today.”\n\nAt that, the other students appear confused as, unlike Prinn and yourself, they have no idea what Kelle is referencing. If anything, it’s a crude joke, base humor. Not something that an upstanding family should ever utter. You hoped he’d bring it up. You lean into it.\n\n“It’s a fortunate thing for you. Rumor is that your performance anxiety translates to standing over an empty pot too.”\n\n“But not to your friend’s face it would seem.” Kelle’s grin widens, his mind reverting back to the moment he sprayed Prinn’s head with shame and dominance.\n\nThat is what you are going for, the line obviously being crossed, persuaded by insults and the memory of taking shit and piss raining from above. The other kids don’t know it and will obviously take your side, rumors are likely already spreading from those who are exiting the hall already. Don’t bring dishonor on your father, Vladimir said. Kelle, unfortunately, wasn’t warned the way you were. Kelle thinks he’s won because of your previous fight. He’s losing the fight now with the crowd. In a place of politics and social standing and family honor, he’s committed the gravest of mistakes: losing the people.\n\n“I withdraw my request,” you say to Kelle. “Clearly, I’m better off finding a tutor who doesn’t revert to base humor and threats better suited for the common workman.”\n\nWith that, Kelle finally realizes his mistake. He quickly utters a polite, if rushed, farewell and half walks, half runs out the lecture hall. The other kids crowd around, offering their condolences for Kelle’s behavior and promises that they’ll support you if you were to report him to Master Gavin and the school’s administration. A man (well, boy) of the people, you tell them that you’re not planning to elevate it, that you’re just wanting to focus on your studies, taking the higher path and the position of someone wronged, which will only increase their favor.\n\n“You’re rather silent,” you say to Prinn once the hall is empty again. “Thought you of all people would want to get a dig in or two.”\n\n“Perhaps next time,” Prinn answers, his voice soft in tone, wavering. “Listen, I’m going to call it. See you tomorrow?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nPrinn leaves the hall. You stand a moment in victory, then go your own way.\n\nLittle did you know it would be the last time you saw the boy.\n\nUntil now.\n\nScoutleader Prinn stops scratching his chin. “Perhaps the Alterans can be persuaded to waive the terms.”\n\n“Good luck with that,” you say. “They want nothing more than to send the garrison packing.”\n\n“Oh I’m not so sure that’s the case.” Prinn’s eyes fall on the bound Redding. Oh. A whistle escapes Prinn’s lips, like that of a bird chirping in the forest, sounding eerily similar to ones you heard when first traveling through the New World jungle. Were the scouts following you the entire way? It matters little at this point. Leaves rustle in the wind, although you know it to be more than that. One of the green cloaks following his scoutleader’s command. More still lie hidden around you. You’re sure of that.\n\n“I’m flattered you would think of me so highly, but I’m with the kid. I seriously doubt turning me in will cause the Alterans to keep hundreds of Magdan soldiers around,” Redding says.\n\n“They will...because the true enemy, the Blackbirds, requires both of our nation’s focus. They will be receiving a strong ally as well.”\n\n“Alteran was only able to capture the fort because of his--our--actions. Instead of chains, they may place a laurel on Redding’s head,” you say, leaving yourself out as part of the deal. So far it seems like Prinn is only interested in Redding. Placing obvious emphasis on the single man’s exchange, will let you know Prinn’s intention, whether or not you’re to be included as well. You’re not.\n\n“If that were the case, then you’d have a small force of Alterans with you to rescue your war hero,” Prinn easily answers. “This man is a fugitive, simple as that. You are too, but what’s the expression? ‘Bigger fish?’”\n\n“You’re set on following this through, aren’t you?”\n\nPrinn replies with a nod.\n\n“And nothing I say or do will change your mind?”\n\n“No. You could try to stop me. Perhaps, you even could. But no, nothing will change my mind. I don’t suggest you try, however.”\n\nYour eyes briefly meet Redding’s. He seems content where he is. Most men would struggle, show animosity towards their captor. Redding’s expression is the same as sitting in an ale room, minus a little color in the cheeks. He seems interested to see how you will react, play the hero or the gambler, letting the cards fall where they may. You’re not entirely sure yourself. But still, you are leaning towards one, if not slightly.\n",
  "page 132": "You’ve never been much of a card player. Those you’ve played with fellow soldiers over the years have never amounted to much. Sure, there’s been a few lucky nights, but not as many as there should have been. It’s not even that you’re unable to keep a blank face when need be. Bluffing, lying is actually something that you’re fairly decent at. It’s simply that lady luck has you in the perpetual dog house, feeling as if a woman scorned towards you, the odds never falling in your favor. Lady luck, a bitch if you ever knew one.\n\nAnd that’s what you’ve been doing until now, isn’t it? Playing your best with the hand dealt to you. That’s all anyone does. Or is that simply the lie we tell ourselves? Life is a card game. You can’t control the hand dealt, a random shuffle. But you can do the best with what you have, even if it’s a losing hand from the start. You know all about that from actual card games. No, life can’t be the same. You’ll not allow it to be the same. The analogy assumes one’s life is set according to a specific set of rules. You won’t play that game. You’ve never had success with the game. Instead, you remove yourself from the equation, and allow circumstances to play out.\n\n“You may run into enemies on the way,” you start. “But I’m not to be included as one of them.”\n\nOddly enough, Redding smiles at this. You just sealed the man’s fate for execution, and he...smiles. Part of you realizes the struggle you’ve made it through to save his life--just to throw it away now. But you’re not throwing it away. That implies action. You’re simply letting the circumstance play out according to the actions of each player. Besides, what are you going to do? Shoot a childhood friend, fight your way through more than ten unseen scouts? No. Redding knew the risks. His plan was well-thought out, but it wasn’t thorough enough. It didn’t account for the Alterans invading. On the plus side, that’s something that would have never happened in the Old; it’d take a lot for a direct confrontation to occur. Perhaps the ways of the New are blossoming on their own. Perhaps that’s why Redding is smiling.\n\n“No fight? I must admit I’m rather surprised,” Prinn says, checking the bonds of Redding, making to depart back to the garrison.\n\n(And I’m disappointed.)\n\n“There’s been enough bloodshed between those who I wouldn’t count among my own enemies,” you say.\n\nPrinn just nods and makes for the trees. It’s silent between all speakers for a moment, sending the small sounds of the creek into your ears like white rapids. “I remember you, you know,” he says at last. “A distant memory. It’s foggy. But you’re there.”\n\n“I remember you too,” you answer. “Although my memory is clear. You disappeared. There one day, gone the next. It was the talk of the school for years.”\n\n“Yes...I went somewhere,” Prinn says, distant, like a man waking from a bad dream. “I remember laughing, not laughter of my own, not laughter in joy. Just, laughter. At me.”\n\n“Kelle?”\n\nFor a second, Prinn’s face flashes ugly. It’s the face of a husband finding out his wife betrayed him, mixed with the face of the wife herself, shame and secret bore for all to see. Then it’s back to blank and expressionless, a slate of a man not yet sculpted, empty. “Kelle…” he ponders. “I do not remember that name.”\n\nRedding and you glance at one another, forgetting the fact that he’s a prisoner sentenced to death for a moment. No words need to be shared between you; it’s obvious to him that Prinn remembers the name, whether it’s suppressed by the mind or not, a spotty memory like that of a trauma victim.\n\n“Do you know what happened to Kelle?” you repeat the name again.\n\nMixture. Flash. Blank. “I do not know of who you speak of.”\n\n“What happened to Kelle?” Redding, this time, asks. The third mention of the name breaks through the barrier. Prinn’s face returns to the mixture, but does not revert back to the slate. His skin turns red, hot. Like a sticky gear finally finding its groove, recognition appears. Another quick glance between you and Redding. His eyes seem to shrug.\n\n“Kelle...I remember now… He was evil and (was) bullied those smaller than him. Smart, yes. But not the smartest. Strong, yes. But only towards those weaker than himself.”\n\nYou attempt to guide Prinn’s thoughts. “He disappeared. Not long after a couple of...disagreements between us.”\n\n“Yes...that’s right,” Prinn speaks to the empty air. “He was no doubt planning retaliation. To hit us worse than we hit him.”\n\n“That was the plan,” you say. “To damage his reputation in front of the other students and let Kelle, himself, finish the deed. We put him in poor standing. One attempt at revenge, publicly known, would have him thrown from the school, despite who his father was. Except he disappeared before that could happen. You--”\n\n“We both did,” Prinn finishes your next words.\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“I adjusted the plan. Made it so he could never prey on the weak again.”\n\n“And exactly how did you do that?” Redding asks. You briefly imagine him raising an eyebrow. He doesn’t, of course.\n\nPrinn turns to him. “Isn’t the answer obvious?”\n\nIsn’t the answer obvious? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Of course it is. Young Prinn, after leaving the lecture hall, can’t stop a feeling deep within. It’s like an itch that can’t be scratched, the tingling of a limb when falling asleep at an awkward position. It’s so simple. Prinn knows how to make it so Kelle doesn’t retaliate. A plan truly that’s thorough enough. End Kelle, end the suffering. It’s as simple as that.\n\nHe wishes he kept the green cloak with him, the one that he wore in the forest a week earlier. It made him feel powerful. Strong. Not like the brainiac everyone believes him to be. But he is, though. Why should he pretend to be someone else?\n\nBecause brainiacs get bullied. Pissed on.\n\nThe strong don’t. Prinn’s best friend, despite not testing higher than the bottom 10% of the class, proved that fact. And Prinn’s memory retention is second-to-none. A mere glance at a page, and he can recite the words flawlessly. Facts, history, mathematical formulas: they appear to him in his mind, easily located like finding one’s horse in the stable. He’s glad to have learned it early in his life before any more time is wasted: knowledge is useless without the authority to act upon it. He’s spent his entire life, albeit a short one so far, focused on discovering knowledge. Useless, without the strength of the arm as a foundation.\n\nFor the first time Prinn doesn’t have a plan. What good are plans anyway? They’re a tunnel, forcing the planner into a single-lane road. Prinn’s mind is quick. Better to leave all options open and adapt to the circumstance. It clicks in his mind the way a buckle clasps for the first time. Infinite choices are at one’s fingertips. The likelihood of accounting for every option, having the plan go according to...well, the plan is slim to none. Account for nothing, adapt, and you’ll never find yourself at a loss.\n\nKelle ducks into a building. Prinn knows it well. It’s a place designed for experiments of science. Students, with the proper credentials, can use a laboratory for themselves. Most use it for alchemical purposes, the rare few at Prinn’s age know chemistry. There’s no guard. No doorman. If you hadn’t received a key from the main office, you can’t enter. Kelle has a key. So does Prinn. Waiting a few minutes after Kelle, Prinn takes the small five-step staircase to the building. The hallways are empty. Occupants are either in their labs or unable to be called as such. Prinn always hated the floors here. Black and white checkered tile. Unlike the rest of the campus, built from polished wood, the laboratory has a cold feeling with it, lifeless, like the students are mere pieces on a board game.\n\nPrinn doesn’t have a plan, although thoughts are starting to emerge. He’s adapting. Each laboratory is mostly private. There are no windows, for safety reasons. Any experiment gone wrong is contained in the room. All that connects the lab to the outside hallway is a small slit in the door, a rectangle chunk carved from reinforced steel, oddly reminiscent to the small opening a prisoner would receive moldy bread and cheese. It’s through the slits that Prinn scans through the labs. Cold, lifeless, his body adapts to the very building itself. He passes by a few, creeping along on the balls of his feet. A few older students are working on potions, the occasional firework. Citizens love fireworks, and the school will pay good money for a student who makes them. Not as good as the school will sell them for, but hey, it’s better than sticking your nose in a book at a deficit. Finally, Prinn finds his mark. His experiment. His prey.\n\nThrough the slit in the door, Prinn watches Kelle, unaware of the boy looking into his lab. The room itself is a slice of nature. Like the slit, it’s a rectangle in shape, two long walls, two short ones. Unlike the rest of the building, however, it’s a jungle; stepping into the lab is like being in a small clearing. Vines and trees fill the walls and ceiling, complete with a dirt floor, mimicking a real jungle floor. Various plants fill the “clearing,” shapes of bright red, purple, and white shine brilliantly against the dimly-lit lab. In the center, built from wooden planks, is an alchemy table. Tubes, beakers, and smaller vials rest on top. More underneath. Prinn watches Kelle grab for a few ingredients, plucking them from their artificial spot of growth. Once he’s collected enough, the boy returns to the table, finding a mortar and pestle.\n\nHis target distracted, Prinn decides to act. He studies the cadence of Kelle’s mixing. One, two, three, Prinn unlatches the door to the lab at the exact moment Kelle would engage the next motion of the mortar. It’s not the best, but it’s the best in the current situation, which Prinn has no problem taking advantage of. He slides the door open to a small crack, just enough to where he can slip through unnoticed. The door closes without a sound, the boy, himself, following suit. The light is low. Dim. Mimicking natural light from an actual jungle. It helps the students focus, according to Master Gavin. Out away from magelight or candlelight, it forces the alchemist to be immersed in the environment. Prinn, a shadow between trees, a silent stalker in the jungle, creeps forward. End Kelle, end the suffering. Simple as that.\n\nHis target’s back is turned, busy mixing and grinding different ingredients to dust. Prinn, but a boy who would grow up to lead the scouts in the New World, briefly steps into his future self, channeling his studies, focusing them in his mind. Strength of body. Strength of mind. Prinn’s relied on the latter for too long. It’s about time he became one of the strong.\n\nThe knife briefly flashes in the artificially-lit room, a twinkle of steel like the first stars of the night appearing in the nightsky. Kelle doesn’t turn. He doesn’t face the boy in the eye, the boy who he bullied, shamed. Quick and efficient. Prinn thrusts the dagger forward without drawing it back. Quick and efficient, he slides it into Kelle’s lower back. It cuts easily into the boy’s skin as if a farmer digging through fertile soil.\n\nAnd just like that, it’s over. There’s no rush of panic that falls over Prinn’s body, the coming down after a passion-fueled deed. His hands are steady. His mind is clear. Prinn scans the lab for the necessary ingredients. Cleaning up will take awhile, but everything he needs is present. Blood begins to darken the dirt at the base of the table. Prinn takes a deep breath and readies himself for hours of work, mentally running through each task needed to be performed in order. Kelle isn’t even breathing and he’s causing problems for Prinn, still. The gruesome thought brings small curves to the corner of Prinn’s lips. That soon won’t be the case.\n\nEnd Kelle, end the suffering. It’s as simple as that.\n\n“End Kelle, end the suffering,” Scoutleader Prinn finishes, trancelike.\n\nYou and Redding glance at each other. You’re not used to seeing Redding without words lining up to leave his mouth. The line’s empty now, and the same can be said for your own. Three shadows, donned in green, become a blur in the corner of your vision. The scouts drop down from trees towering overhead, two of which draw their hunting bows and aim them at you. They aren’t as concerned with Redding, who is still bound and tied. The third scout pulls an object from his belt, something small that fits in the palm of his hand. He walks over to his scoutleader, takes one of his hands, and places the object in his palm.\n\nPrinn looks at his palm like a card player playing with known cheats. Recognition appears in his eyes, like the act of scanning a crowd and finding the person you’re looking for. It seems to take him from the trance. He is back to the stern, if not expressionless, leader as before. He hands the object back to the scout, hiding it from your view. He places a hand on the scout’s shoulder in appreciation, the way an aging father treats a son.\n\n“It was the talk of the school for years,” you break the silence. “Both you and Kelle suddenly vanished one day, and you know how kids like to spread rumors.”\n\n“I left,” the scoutleader says. “All that I could have learned during months of studying, I learned that day. I pursued knowledge in a more...applicable setting. Kelle,” he spits the name, “was (was) the first of many. When I accomplished all that I could in the city, I came to the place where the world makes sense, both of them. Nature. Uncivilized land. It runs on rules far greater than the ones that we create for ourselves.”\n\n(he sounds a lot like...)\n...Redding, I know.\n\n“But you,” Prinn continues. “You ran away to Alteran and actively opposed the Supreme Leader. I suppose I should be asking you why, but now is not the time or place. Just answer me this: why did you run from Magda in the first place?”\n\nThe question hangs heavy in the air. Prinn looks at you expectantly. Redding the same. It’s the question that’s hunted you from a young age. It first appeared in your mind as a youth, an itch of a thought that you couldn’t scratch, not until you actually left the country of your birth. Why did you run from your home? The answer is simple, more simple than something of this magnitude should be. When you trace the origin, the root, however, it’s the cause behind everything.\n\nYou open your mouth and speak. “Restlessness.”\n\nPrinn simply nods, understanding. “Then I hope you find the rest that you seek.”\n\nRedding puts his thoughts to words as well. “Remember what we spoke about. See you on the other side, kid. Don’t do anything...stupid.”\n\nWith that, Prinn leads Redding, his prisoner, out from the creek. You have no doubt that the scouts are following in the trees overhead. You stand alone. No allies or nation to run back to, alone in a New World far from your beginnings. They say the New World is many times larger than the Old. An entire world lies before you ready to be discovered. Tamed. The cards have revealed destiny for each player. Prinn rose from a schoolboy to a scoutleader. Redding, ever the idealist, finally caught up with--and not seeming surprised or scared to face the music. Perhaps that was his plan all along. One man’s death can have more impact than another’s life.\n\nFor the third time you scan the creek, marred by your presence. Forever stained with the blood you spilled. Smooth stones with moss. Running water, once clear. Bodies strewn exactly where you ended the Blackbird warriors. Off in the distance, a bird chirps, filling in small gaps of silence between the creek and wind, softly whispering at your neck. For the third time you scan the creek; in this case, it’s the last.\n",
  "page 131": "You’ve been a man of action your entire life, from childhood devising plans to get back at Kelle, to enlisting in the army and surviving many battles. Sitting around, letting others decide your fate, is nothing that you’ve done before, and you’re sure as hell not going to start now.\n\n(I know that look.)\nYou wanted more, artifact. You’re getting it.\n(Ha! Yes! FIre me away. Let me taste them, drink their health, oops, I mean to their health!)\n\nSlightly worrying. Bigger fish.\n\nPrinn hasn’t seen the artifact in action, the way it can reshape itself into various weapons, your favorite being the six-shooter. He doesn’t know that the black ring on your finger is the dagger that Redding previously fought with, the very one that Alexander lended the aid of the garrison to recover, the one that the war party is after. He doesn’t know until it’s too late. The boy with blonde curls, now shaved, the boy who wore glasses, now apparently not needed, the boy whose life was changed forever by your childhood actions are once again changed by your willingness to act. His head, the one that Kelle shamed, stained with piss and tears, appears down the sight of the black barrel.\n\nBlack smoke fills the air. For a split second, the image of Prinn as a boy appears, down on his knees, unable to look you in the eye. The next, the image dissolves, replaced with one of the adult version, a red bullet hole squarely in the middle of his forehead. Prinn’s body falls over backwards, landing with his green cloak spread out as if a picnic blanket. A few arrows spill from his quiver, the rope holding Redding falls from grasp. You don’t have time to reflect, logging it to the list of questionable actions that you’ve recently committed. There’ll be a time to contemplate, pay for your deeds. Now, however, there are unseen enemies in the trees, deadly with the hunting bow.\n\n(Aww no fun!) The artifact becomes a tower shield in your hand, a solid slab of black, like staring through an open doorway in the middle of the night. Thwunk, thwunk, thwunk! Almost instantaneously, arrows land against the artifact, less than you expected, which only means that Prinn has a number of the green cloaks elsewhere, likely thinking that there wouldn’t be much trouble at the hidden doorway. You and Redding already handled most of that, the bodies of the fallen Blackbirds still staining the creek with their blood.\n\nBefore another volley can be fired, the six-shooter appears in your hand. Best to make it quick. For a brief moment you’ll be unprotected. Then again, so are the green cloaks. You fire several shots into the trees, using the angle of the blocked arrows as an imaginary line back towards the origin. You’re rewarded with at least two small grunts and as many bodies plunging from the canopy, breaking branches and leaves along the way down. They hit the ground with a solid thud, a much deeper, fuller sound than their arrows ever made.\n\n(Mmm, gimme more to taste!)\nThere’s no shortage of that, I assure you.\n\nThe artifact turns back into a shield as you await the next volley of arrows. It doesn’t come. The forest is silent, save for background sounds of nature, the wind rustling through leaves, the occasional song of wildlife. Your breath becomes slow and steady, each exhale lasting for seemingly minutes at a time. Your eyes scan the trees looking for unseen enemies. They remain exactly that. If the green cloaks are reorganizing, you don’t have much time. Free Redding and move on. Luckily, Prinn took care of Redding’s wounds. You might have made a mess of things. There’s at least one positive aspect of the current outcome, a second being that you escaped with your life. Speaking of Redding...\n\nHe stands exactly where Prinn left him, not even taking cover for the trees during the volley of arrows. He motions towards his bindings. “Care to help me out, hero?”\n\nWith the black dagger, you cut through the rope in a single slash. That word, “hero,” doesn\u0027t sit well with you. “Don’t call me that.”\n\n“Suit yourself,” Redding says, stretching his arms and rubbing his wrists for blood flow. “You’re becoming dangerous with that thing. It’s like second-nature, the way you seamlessly cycle between forms.”\n\n“If I need a flintlock, I shoot. If arrows are fired at me, I need a shield. It’s as simple as that,” you answer. “What’s next for us? There are two armies, three if you count the war party, that are out to get us. We have no allies, no aid, no support. There’s an entire New World in front of us and no friends to help accomplish the mission.”\n\n“But we have each other,” Redding says, placing a hand on your shoulder. His eyes meet yours for a few calm seconds, then he breaks into a grin. “Damn near had you going there, didn’t I?”\n\n“Yeah, damn near had me questioning my decision to ever help you,” you return back.\n\nYou scan the creek. It’s littered with bodies, weapons, arrows. It’s once-peaceful demeanor is replaced with the violence of man and the tools of destruction, perhaps a small example of what the New World would turn into, a glimpse into the future. Once a place filled with life, with nature content to mind to its own business is stained, marred by the invasion of man. Redding is right. The ways of the Old can’t be brought to this place. There must be a new set of rules, a new way of living. The Old World is dying; the New can still be kept alive.\n",
  "page 112": "Darkness. Darkness abounds. Never has the light abandoned you as this. Not even on the blackest nights, during the nightmares brought on by childhood, or even worse, those occurring as a man. The mouth of the tunnel leads you down a narrow path, no signs of alternate routes or branches exist here. You walk forward, hands stretched out in front, feeling the stone walls as you continue into the darkness. It’s cool, the kind of temperature that greets you in the morning, a sign, perhaps, that the trial is only just beginning.\n\nThe journey takes you around several twists and bends before you arrive at a clearing. Small gemstones saturate the rocks here, a full nightsky in each stone, sending the entire clearing into a lunar glow, although the darkness still sends the ceiling into an endless black. You stride forward, aware of the crunching of rocks underneath your boots, the sound of every breath. It’s dead quiet in the gauntlet; every movement from your body brings defilement.\n\nLike all the Harri’ar architecture you’ve seen, the room seems to focus on a single point, centered around an object at the center. In this case, it’s a sarcophagus. It’s built like...\n\n...you’ve seen it before. It’s a replica of the one in the halls of the dead, the place where you and Redding first discovered the artifact. If the scene will play out similarly, then--\n\n--Stone shatters. Rocks separate, lighting bolt cracks running through their bodies. The lid of the sarcophagus follows suit, a large crack twisting down the center like a painted river on a map. In a shower of rock, a hand reaches out from within the sarcophagus. Not a second later, the other grabs a handful of air as it, too, breaks out. The arms themselves possess a layer of decaying skin, gaps showing all the way to the bone. Another shower of rock. Feet, skin hanging to the bone like a poorly-stitched tunic. A mouth without a jaw. Empty gaps where eyes should reside, the same for its nose.\n\nThe creature rises to meet you, not a lich. Not an undead priest. But, Redding.\n\nHiyya, kid.\n\nHis voice appears both in your mind and through your ears, audibly. It’s different, though. And not due to its medium, although that’s another point to quickly address. It reminds you of your childhood, the way a classroom friend would speak to you. A certain innocence, or perceived innocence accompanies it. Here’s a man speaking like he knows every goddamn truth to grace mankind. Whether childlike ignorance or a good cardplayer, you’re sure to find out the answer soon, the undead Redding patiently awaits your reply.\n\nTake your time; I\u0027ve only got...eternity! Ha ha!\n\n“You aren’t him,” you flatly state.\n\nAm I not? This is how you view me.\n\nYou bite down on your tongue. Answering “Redding” would give credibility to his statement. Instead, you scan the area for a path forward. None exist, or at least none that are visible. The cavern walls hide in the shadows; they could be either a foot or a hundred paces and you wouldn’t know for certain.\n\nWant to see my bunkmate?\n\nBefore you can answer, another pair of arms reaches from within the sarcophagus. It must be deeply built, if two bodies can fit within, assuming it’s actually there. Hands grab for the outer edges of the sarcophagus like the way one would rise from a bathtub, skin hanging loosely from bone. The new figure rises, and you can see a long ring of black hair around its skull. Dead, decaying, there’s no mistaking the second undead man. It’s like looking into a mirror, minus the obvious difference in health. It’s you.\n\nThe artifact. All that matters is the artifact.\nYou would abandon your allies for it.\nAbandon. Betray.\nWhatever it takes.\n\n“You” dialogue with Redding, and it strikes you that the exchange sounds very similar to the way you and Amir’sshan speak. That’s where the thought ends, however. Whatever meaning you’re meant to discern from the symbolism is lost on you. The undead version of yourself now addresses you.\n\nYou betrayed your family.\n\n“The company is fine,” you answer, this time, thinking of Bastus and Lionel. “They were rescued by the battalion’s takeover.”\n\nYou betray them even now, not even acknowledging their presence.\n\nOh. So it meant your real family: A father too concerned with his work for your well-being, an overbearing mother, an older sister with achievements far beyond your own. Hell, Vladimir felt like more of a family figure than those who share your blood. Your name presented too much renown in Magda to escape to the military there. Even operation under a false name would eventually be discovered. Magda may be a large territory, but its social ladder makes it operate like one much smaller, everyone of reputable position knowing the dealings of other families. In Magda, both enemies and allies alike are invited to dinner, just remain vigilant of missing table knives.\n\n“If my actions are considered a betrayal, then it’s only justified. I didn’t start...whatever disagreements we had, but I certainly wasn’t going to hang around as the family scapegoat.”\n\nYou left your father with no heir.\n\n“He’s fine in that regard. My sister would lead the house better than I ever could, and I mean that. They’re better off with me gone.”\n\nYour house is no more. Dissolved. Consumed by a rival house. Vladimir was assassinated in the streets. Your sister was forced to marry into the rival’s bloodline, a former classmate of yours. Do you remember a boy named Kelle?\n\nRemember him, the boy stands at the very center of a memory long forgotten, suppressed over the years and medicated with drink and other...distractions, a story that is the nightmare of every adolescent. That is not this story, however, and you are no longer an adolescent. So your father’s house fell apart in your absence. Perhaps it was always destined to set upon that course. Who knows. There’s no determining for sure, although the loss of Vladimir might have been the beginning of the end. Your father’s man performed every task for his master, including serving as a sliver of what a father figure might be.\n\n“Their fate is their own,” you find yourself saying. “As well as mine is my own.”\n\nFlesh and blood is a lifelong bond.\n\n“No, it’s a strong bond, but it’s not lifelong,” you answer. Your hand subconsciously travels to Amir’sshan. “I know what a true bond is, felt.”\n\nIt’s taking him over already.\nI see it happening too.\nThe allure of power, blinding.\nHe cannot see what’s occurring before his eyes.\n\n“Quit the riddles. Speak plainly,” you address the undead.\n\nPlainly, then, the undead version of you speaks.\nYou’re the boss, undead Redding adds on.\nAmir’sshan will consume you.\nA mortal body he desires.\nThe mad god feigns as an ally.\nBut he seeks to trap another within the dagger.\n\n“You lie. You attempt to break me from my bond when I need it most. You work with the S’umbra and seek to remove our greatest weapon before the challenge.”\n\nCome on.\nIt’s just us three.\nAmir’sshan holds no place here.\nIt’s your one safe place from the mad god.\nStay awhile.\nStay with us.\n",
  "page 114": "“That is not happening,” you answer. “I’d rather stick around with two Magda soldiers than with you two. Now, I’m moving on, and you can either watch me go or you can take it up with Amir’sshan.” You pat the artifact again, feeling the buzz of power that emanates within. They lied. As bondsman, you feel the artifact’s energy. Amir’sshan might not have spoken during the exchange, but he was present. You’re sure of it. They sought to weaken your bond; instead, they’ve strengthened it beyond all fraying.\n\nAs you wish.\nWe warned you.\n\nWith that, the two undead men before you twist in motion. Bones snap, loose skin falls to the ground at their bony toes. Redding starts to cackle a witch-like laughter, the kind that supposes meaning in the taunt. The sarcophagus draws to them. It pulls the undead creatures like a riverbed around a large stone. An unseen power takes them back, two pairs of feet sliding backward on the cavern floor. In another explosion of stone, the undead are shoved back into the sarcophagus, a marred lid the only evidence of the tomb’s brief escapees. You’re back alone in the gauntlet. Then, a light appears. It starts soft, a low glow in the distance. Like the first signs of the morning sunrise, it creeps forward tentatively, an orange-red hue. You decide to meet it. You walk forward, leaving behind the sarcophagus. At least there are no ladders this time around.\n\nThe world around you vanishes from sight. Darkness settles in for a moment as if pondering amongst itself. Then, the light returns. Red-orange framed by shifting shadows. A throne appears at the center of the light, like in the spotlight of a play. Instantly, you know it is Amir’sshan’s, his place of rule of Harri’katan. And if there’s something you’ve learned about the man-god, he has a taste for the theatrical. You sense a presence. It’s the feeling like you’re being watched, an unknown, unguided intuition that you’re not alone.\n\n“Come forward,” you speak into the darkness.\n\nAre you prepared?\n\nYour hand instinctively reaches for the artifact. As you draw it, you affirm your position. “Are you?”\n\nA spirit reveals itself from behind the throne. Like with the throne, you can only think one name: Amir’sshan. He towers above you, near the same height as Chieftain Malic’ant back in his day. Like you, he wears an a’lta and a headdress, only his is extravagantly embroidered, full of feathers without a single marred or plucked from its stem. It’s in that moment that you’re aware of your faults, your own shortcomings. You’ve never considered yourself short, unsmuscular, or unattractive, and suddenly, you’re all those things in comparison. When Amir’sshan speaks again, you tack on unintelligent to the list, sure that there will be more to add momentarily.\n\nBondsman. It is a rare thing for us to meet face to face. Well, in your case, face to chest.\n\n“You’re--taller than expected,” is what you manage to say.\n\nThe spirit laughs. Yes, yes. Tall for someone trapped for centuries in a black mithril dagger. Feels good to finally stretch my legs a bit. Had a nasty kink in my back.\n\n“How are you allowed to escape?” you ask. “And why not do it sooner?”\n\nIt’s the ‘gauntlet of the gods,’ is it not? You may not know this, but they call me the man-god.\n\n“Of course I know that,” you snap back. If you thought dealing with the voice was frustrating, dealing with the man(god) behind it is even worse. “You know what I mean.”\n\nCareful, bondsman. One cannot simply assume another knows what they mean...but in this case, I do. The prison is deteriorating.\n\nBreaking.\n\nBehold.\n\nYour hand, still touching the artifact, jumps back instinctively. The artifact moves on its own, a low rumble grows from within. You draw it for a closer examination, and as soon as you do, a black puff of smoke appears. It’s the last exhaust of a dying man, a mere shadow of the powerful thunderclouds that accompany a shape shift. Then it crumbles in your hand. Its wing-tipped grip fades to dust, a black sand that escapes your hands, flowing down the sides of your palms and in between your fingers. A gust of wind catches it on the way to the cavern floor, a chilly gale that loses the artifact forever.\n\n“So you’ll be free. No longer imprisoned.”\n\nI’ll be lost to eternity, my soul swept away like dust of the earth. I have no body to contain my soul; the godkiller took the form of a placeholder, so to speak, without the ability to move of my own accord, but alive. Very much alive. And I intend to keep it that way until the S’umbra are dealt with.\n\n“Why do I sense there’s a but coming?”\n\nAhh. Not a bad sense for the harem, but, perhaps not what you desire now. That’s because there is one, bondsman.\n\nYou’re careful not to think the phrase “mad-god.” Amir’sshan can likely read your thoughts just as the artifact did. Since you’re faced with his spirit--and somehow you imagine your longsword won’t be effective--you’d rather not start anything that could lead to a confrontation. You’re confident in your skills as a soldier; however, this is unlike any battlefield you’ve been a part of.\n\nThe walls are coming down. Their container of my soul is burnt through. But there is a way to preserve my power. You.\n\n“Me?”\n\nYour body is a suitable vessel. The bond is growing deep. The others could not have held my power without destroying their soul in the process. You are different. The bond unites us in body and spirit. The ‘artifact,’ as you say, is crumbling. The only way for Amir’sshan to survive is if we connect, body and spirit.\n\nNow it’s your turn for the but. “But what will happen to me?”\n\nTypical Old World mindset, always thinking about themselves...I jest. You’ll still be...around. More of a passenger on a boat rather than the one who steers the ship.\n\n“You address the topic easily for one who’s discussing the takeover of one’s body,” you comment. “Are you certain you’ve never gotten this far before, just with those unwilling to depart from their shell.”\n\nDon’t play the jealous farmgirl, asking if your lover’s laid with another.\n\n“Your answer’s yes, then. In my experience, that sort of response is telling in itself.”\n\nThink yourself sly, do you? I’ve been around long enough to know someone’s preference to--oh what’s the Old World phrase? ‘Play second fiddle?’ You may be in possession of your vessel, but you’re anything but the steerer of the ship.\n\nAmir’sshan’s articulate speech feels like it’s slipping. Often the different (mad) style of speaking is lighthearted for the most part, the result of being hundreds, thousands of years old relating to modern times. There’s more than a few generation gaps in place. It’s been direct, downright odd during moments, but never aggressive like this. True, there may have been an outburst or two; never so obviously towards you, however.\n\n“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” you answer, feeling your face becoming hot. When faced with confrontation, you’ve never been one to shy away. “I’m here alone, aren’t I? Running through the trial all by myself, no one else to ‘steer my ship.’ I stand on my own two feet, whether that ends in victory or death, at least I know that I’ve chosen to make my stand. And you cannot take that away from me.”\n\nThe pup bears fangs after all. Interesting. You are in no more control of your life than I am of the High King’s. Yes, I know who he is. You are here because I’ve guided you here. You stand alone? False. I stand by you, lead you, as I have no doubt that your companions would try to convince you otherwise, perhaps minus the priestess. She’s a looker, isn’t she? No doubt will want to lay with Amir’sshan’s vessel. Isn’t that what you want?\n\nIgnoring the obvious prodding, you reaffirm your stance. “My decisions are my own, as E’ffy’s are her own. You have not brought me here any more than I worship the Raven.”\n\nAhh, blasphemy in the face of the gods. Truly, you are special. It’s fun to poke a resting bear until it wakes. Behold!\n\nThe cavern ceiling illuminates above, showering the two of you in a cosmic glow. Stars twinkle into existence, small grains of sand with the heavens as their backdrop. Above, the nightsky appears projected on the dome-shaped ceiling, constellations displayed exactly as a winter night in Alteran. You see the Warrior, his arms extending into “swords,” two streaks of stars forming themselves into straight lines. It’s as if you’re a god yourself, an equal to those Alterans pray to at night, the heavens standing before you, not as a faraway, untouchable thing, but with the closeness of a friend, a welcoming and comforting presence.\n\nYou are but a passenger on the ship. Who brought you to the New World? Who led you to the artifact? Who brought you to the Harri’ar war camp? Who put you on the trial?\n\nThe frightening part about Amir’sshan’s words, besides the truth that accompanies it, is that you hadn’t shared those things with the voice. You never discussed details of your past. The fact that he knows is concerning; no memory, no thought is safe in Amir’sshan’s presence. Such is the bond between the man-god and his bondsman.\n\n“So I’ve ever had companions. That does not mean they swayed my actions. It just means I’ve had the support of others.”\n\nSupport? Bah! A true warrior stands on his own. His strength lies in his own sword arm. All others will fail you. Their shields grow heavy in their arms, wilting. They cannot be trusted to cover your flank. Better to watch your own back. That’s, truly, the only way to live. Stand or fall, it’s by your own making.\n\n“And how did that turn out for you? Strong words for a soul who needs help now. Dare I allow you to stand on your own, then? FIne. Find another vessel to reside in. You ask for my help and then spit in my face for accepting the help of others. Good luck with your next bondsman.”\n\nFool! If you will not offer it freely, then I will take the vessel myself!\n\nThe spirit of Amir’sshan dives forward, both arms stretched in front of him. The feathers on his headdress trail behind him, a wing in flight. You meet the attack with equal ferocity. Your longsword rests in your hand, a foreign weapon since coming into possession of the artifact. It feels heavy in your hand, outdated. The spirit approaches, two ethereal longswords appearing, one in either hand. Amir’sshan moves as if the wind, a flurry of strikes committed before you, barely, have time to muster a defense. He fights as if an angered hornet’s nest, a bear who protects the well-being of her cubs. Amir’sshan sweeps low, then finishes high, his blades in constant motion, the edges themselves a blur.\n\nYou do your best to maintain distance. The longsword you carry at your back is aptly named, better suited to wield with both hands due to its size, which means you can strike from a greater distance. If Amir’sshan--or any opponent for that matter--is able to get in close, then you’d have a difficult time, not to say the act of keeping the spirit of Amir’sshan at distance is any easy task by any means. It takes great footwork and quick reflexes to keep him away, both of which you pride yourself in. Still, they call him the man-god for a reason. The spirit does not relent. It does not falter. It does not tire.\n\nBoth of Amir’sshan’s blades ring across your defensively-raised longsword. Three swords remain stagnant in front of you for a moment; the strength of both wielders pressed against each other. Amir’sshan’s face draws close to yours. His face is young, yet his eyes speak of years well-beyond his looks, a time-tested mixture of stress and wisdom displayed in them.\n\nI’ve nearly forgotten the thrill of combat, the feeling of the clash of swords. Heh. And it will feel even better once in my new vessel!\n\nHe nearly overtakes you after finishing his words.\n\n“The artifact will be your grave,” you answer with a grimace, the strength of the man-god increasing.\n\nSorry, old friend. Your companions will understand. The world will understand. I will not forget you. There’ll be a grand feast in your honor every year. The Last Bondsman, friend of Amir’sshan who sacrificed all for the man-god, the chieftain of chieftains.\n\nThe way Amir’sshan switches tones, addressing you as enemy one second and friend the next is concerning. Your thoughts circle back to the mad-god. Perhaps both are equally true. All other thoughts escape you as the spirit’s boot catches itself behind your heel. Just as you have time to register it, you’re sent sprawling to the cavern floor, two blades following quickly behind. Your life flashes before your eyes, as cliche as the statement itself is.\n\nIt’s not like the stories you’ve heard: events flashing quickly together, a mash-up of important moments in your life. Rather, your mind runs in the opposite direction. The possibility. What could be. What could have been. Missed opportunities. Experiences you’ll never have again. There is regret, sure, but that’s not the theme of it. It’s as if clarity has finally settled in for the first time, unfiltered, unmuddled by other distractions and worthless things that life brings. It’s the feeling of passing into manhood and realizing the petty squabbles and desires of boyhood don’t matter. They never mattered. In the moment, however...in the moment it felt like the fucking world was on a knife’s edge. You feel it on a grand scale. There are things you’ll never get around to. There are people you’ll never express your true feelings towards. And that’s fine. It has to be. It’s not as if you can change it now.\n\nClarity. It speaks.\n\nYou battle, yes, but Amir’sshan can’t kill you. He needs your “vessel.” Instead of fighting back, you accept the outcome. Supine, you toss your longsword away and raise both hands in surrender. The man-god stands over you, both swordpoints at the base of your neck.\n\n“Go on. Do it,” you whisper.\n\nDon’t tempt me, Bondsman.\n\n“Do it,” you utter a second time. “End me here. I’ve betrayed those who’ve grown close, my blood family, the Alteran company I’ve spent years fighting beside. It’s only a matter of time before the same thing happens to E’ffy and Redding. You’ll be doing the world a favor. I’ll not beg. I’ll not plead for mercy. You win. You’ve bested me. End it here. End it now.”\n\nThe spirit raises both swords overhead. Here it is; the restlessness you’ve spent your life avoiding will finally be silenced. Amir’sshan pauses a moment, then he stabs both blades down. As hard as you try, your eyes shut with the sudden motion. The world turns into darkness.\n",
  "page 113": "“I...I will stay with you,” you say, the words barely pouring from your mouth.\n\nExceeelent.\nYou’ll find that it’s rather peaceful here.\n\nAnd suddenly you find that a great weight has been lifted from your body. The burden of the task is a heavy load to bear. True, you aren’t--weren’t--carrying it alone with allies such as Redding and E’ffy, but the main weight still lies on your shoulders, and they’re in a constant state of stress because of it. For the first time in your life, at least since you can remember, you surrender. Give up. Part of you could blame it on not knowing. Rare is the decision that you know the outcome. If you’re being honest with yourself, you knew what this choice would bring: a sudden end to your journey.\n\nYour mind draws to the people you’ll never see again. E’ffy, Redding, of course, but there are smaller players in the grand story of your life that appear now, oddly enough. Your favorite barkeep, soldiers that you’ve trained with--hell, even the sailors that were aboard the Devestator on your voyage to the New World. Strange what appears to the mind when faced with finality. And that’s what faces you now, the end.\n\n(So close, and yet so far. Another bondsman who failed to complete his duty.)\nThere will be another. There is no shortage of those who desire your power.\n(And you’re fine with that?)\nWhatever I feel won’t matter in a manner of seconds.\n(Spoken like a true mortal. Eternity is but a romantic notion. You know nothing of the torment of time...)\n\n(...But you soon will.)\n\nThe undead version of yourself closes in, Redding close behind. You see them. You could attempt to stop them. But you’ve made your choice, and there’s no going back now. Amir’sshan’s final warning rings in your mind. You soon will. The void closes in. You surrender to it. Your journey may be ending prematurely, but finally, the restlessness is gone. It’s not the end you imagined, but damn if you’re not relieved that it’s here. Whether right or wrong, you’ll have time to reflect. The last thought on your mind is the fresh smell of morning dew, one of those lesser experiences that seems to be screaming at you now, another feeling you’ll never have again. Darkness closes in. Finally, you can rest.\n",
  "page 116": "Your eyes open. It takes a second to register sight. Blood lines the edges of Amir’sshan’s ethereal swords, red drops falling from the points. It’s not yours, however. You remain unscathed. Two bodies fall shortly after, Blackbirds dressed similarly in a’ltas, their faces painted with ash. While your exposure to the natives has been short, the ability to distinguish between them is not lost. You recognize the pair of bodies, each carrying two axes. Terr’ok’s bodyguards, the sizable warriors that accompanied him to E’ffy’s temple.\n\nAmir’sshan meets your gaze. He winks, then gestures towards your holster with his head. As you look down, you discover the artifact intact, back in the shape of a dagger at your thigh. Upon return, the spirit is gone. You’re alone, save for the two dead Blackbirds lying next to you, the fabricated nightsky still shining overhead. Realizing there could be additional threat, you rise to your feet and draw the artifact. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. The six-shooter manifests in your hand. A footstep drags on the cavern floor behind you. You wheel, cocking the hammer back. Click. It echoes in the gauntlet, a warning to all who would approach.\n\nTerr’ok, high priest of the S’umbra, ancestor of the Amir’sshan’s assassins, stands before you. He carries the wooden staff with a raven carved at the top. His dark purple robe is frayed at the edges, fitting for the Blackbird. You somehow can’t imagine a native of the New World wearing extravagant clothing--at least what the Alteran nobility would consider extravagant, Amir’sshan excluded. Unlike when you met previously, his hood is pulled low, hiding his features behind a wall of shadow. Terr’ok’s voice speaks from underneath the hood, a lion purring in the jungle.\n\n“Made it this far, I see. Most don’t make it past the crypt of self-reflection.”\n\nWhether that’s the actual name for the events at the sarcophagus or strong symbolism, you know his meaning...and his intent. There’s only one reason why the high priest would meet you here, intervene. The S’umbra were content to sit back as you first entered the gauntlet. Although as you made progress, you imagine nervousness settled in, uneasiness. They took matters into their own hands, as blasphemous as it is. Intervening in the gauntlet of the gods.\n\nKill him. Kill him now.\n(You know, we agree for once.)\n\nYou do not answer Terr’ok. You do not pause to spill words, highlighting your revenge or the journey that’s reached its climax. Your mind does not run to E’ffy, dedicating the shot to the priestess, a friend, perhaps even more. Strange as it sounds, your mind, instead, is filled with images of training. The first time a flintlock was introduced in your hand. How comfortable it felt, a weapon of deadly power with only two pounds of pressure needed to release. Countless hours spent at the range, honing the craft. There were plenty of misses. Many more than the number of hours you practiced. But still you kept at it. After a while, drawing the flintlock felt like lacing up your boots, buttoning your military jacket. Natural and necessary. Pulled from its holster, slamming down the hammer, firing. All in one smooth motion. You do as you’ve done countless times. You do as you defeated the lich to claim the artifact. You aim. You fire.\n\nSmoke appears at your face. As it clears, you expect to see Terr’ok’s body blown apart. He remains standing, however, and you imagine a grin shining underneath the hood. Your bullet falls harmlessly at his feet in a sound no louder than a needle dropping, although here, in this moment, it sounds like stormy waves slamming into the side of a ship at sea.\n\n(EEEEEEEEE)\n\nAmir’sshan screams in your mind. It’s all you can do to hold a straight face. His sudden outburst affected you before. You’ll not let it happen again.\n\n“The Veil,” Terr’ok explains,” protects me.”\n\n“And here I thought it was supposed to be the Raven,” you retort. The mention of their god sets him off.\n\n“Who do you think bestowed the power upon me,” Terr’ok hisses. “Your accusation is full of blasphemy. The Raven helps those who helps themselves. I do not worship and expect the Raven to fulfill all for me. One must be willing to fight for their belief.”\n\nYou ignore the obvious point of blasphemy as Terr’ok is currently interrupting a test meant to prove the gods’ favor. And you know what? Perhaps he’s simply a part of it. The Blackbird people aren’t ones to ignore customs; that was seen clearly with the tradition in Chieftain Malic’ant’s hut. Intervening on the trial meant to be judged by the gods: that’s more than enough cause to remove the S’umbra from power. Terr’ok’s done you a favor. Your enemy has come to you. In one fell swoop you can prove the Blackbird gods support you and the S’umbra aren’t worthy to lead. You’ll need to survive the encounter, of course, and you have a strong feeling that Terr’ok isn’t planning to allow you to simply walk out of the gauntlet.\n\n“Your people will be better off without you,” you say. Amir’sshan becomes a blade in your hand. You emphasize your words by pointing the sword tip at Terr’ok. “You will be remembered as a group of power-hungry priests using your religion as a weapon against your own people. Parents will tell bedtime stories to their children of the evil S’umbra, of Terr’ok, the coward who hid behind the name of his god. They will celebrate your death. Their only mourning will be that you weren’t removed from power earlier. You will be nothing but a stain on your people’s history, a name accompanied with spit. Your fate runs much deeper than bodily death. I will destroy your very being.”\n\nThe hood prevents you from seeing Terr’ok’s response, but you can tell he’s seething. You imagine his teeth grinding together, eyebrows narrowed. His grip around the ravenheaded staff grows tight. White color starts to show at his knuckles, the staff itself threatening to snap in pieces.\n\n“You, my misled outsider, will pay for that.” Terr’ok’s staff raps against the cavern floor. It echoes softly, the sound appearing all around you, diminishing in volume. Then it grows larger, louder. Another tap. It appears behind you. All around you. Tap. It’s joined by others. The S’umbra, more than just Terr’ok. Tap. More hooded figures step out from the darkness, wearing the same dark purple robes as their high priest. Tap. They carry the same staves; their faces hide in the shroud. Only you stand, exposed to all; you and Amir’sshan.\n\n(I am myself again.)\nNot entirely, but I know what you mean.\n(Kill them?)\nKill them all.\n\nSix of them stand before you. Six proud men, confident in their abilities, never tasting the bitterness of defeat. Soon. It’s a flavor that’ll soon overwhelm their senses. Curious, the thunderclouds appear. Black smoke subsides in Amir’sshan’s shape shifting. The six-shooter, fitting name for the circumstance, lies in your palm. Terr’ok may be protected by the Veil, but, perhaps, the others aren’t. There’s only one way to find out. You attempt to fire at all the newcomers. Your hand slams against the hammer, hard enough to bruise, firing the weapon directly from the hip. You don’t watch to discover if your bullets land true. Rather, your eyes fix on the next target, the next victim.\n\nAnd just as you hoped, they aren’t covered by the Veil. At least not at first. Three fall to the dirt, their hoods removed from covering their faces, exposed like you. Perfect bullet-sized holes lie in the center of their foreheads. A crater of blood starts to pour down the sides of their faces, soon to grace their bodies in a crimson pool. Three. You’re able to drop three before the Veil extends to the remainder.\n\nTerr’ok screams in fury at the sudden loss of his brethren.\n\nEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\n“Your own” screech projects from your mouth, drops of spit fly from your lips, brought upon by the rage building within Amir’sshan. You use it as fuel, a source of energy yet untapped. The remaining S’umbra won’t be dropped by marksmanship; they’ll have to be handled with a more hands on approach. Fine with you. You’ve been relying on the six-shooter too much. Might as well put your sword skills to the test. They’ve felt a little neglected as of late.\n\nBlack smoke. Thunderclouds. The black blade once again threatens the S’umbra. It’s a weapon they recognize, something that was buried deep within the halls of the dead, hoped to be lost to eternity. Amir’sshan will not stay buried. Amir’sshan will not be forgotten. The man(mad)-god makes his presence known, felt, in the form of a black blade with a wing-tipped hilt.\n\nThe Blackbird priests don’t just allow you to cut them down. Flames, real fire, not from ravenlight, ignite at the tops of their staves, near the carved raven. In an instant, you know that they are the ones who greeted the Alteran voyage on arrival to the New World. The fire does not arrive in siege form, however; that might bring the entire cavern down. Streaks of small flame, like piercing arrows, fly towards you.\n\nAmir’sshan shapes into a tower shield, a defensive tool that covers your body from damn near ankles to neck. Fire impacts against the shield, each a bright flash of light, each a steady impact against your arm. Underneath the cover of the shield, you rely upon the feel of battle. Unable to view with your eyes--unless you risk exposing your face to the flame--you draw upon other senses to guide you, the cadence of the flame against the shield, the sound of the high priests casting their spells, knowledge that they can’t continue at this pace for much longer. It’s only a matter of time--\n\n--daylight! Figuratively speaking. A window of opportunity opens before you, and like any good thief scouring the streets of Alteran’s capital city, you don’t squander the chance. The flame lets up for just a brief moment, the pause between each inhale and exhale, the moment when eyes see but the mind does not register: the moment when magic is spent, making the caster vulnerable to an ex-soldier and a god trapped in a mithril weapon.\n\nThe six-shooter will not help you with the Veil in place, so, instead, you allow Amir’sshan to do as he pleases. Rather than sticking with weapons that you’re familiar with, hold mastery over, you give Amir’sshan the freedom to shape as necessary, for the desire to cut down the priests are equally shared between you two. His, a revenge building over thousands of years in torment, trapped. Yours, a conviction to remove such people from power, starting first with the people of the New World, then moving to the Old.\n\nBlack smoke. Thunderclouds. Spear. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. Longsword. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. Axe. Black smoke. Thundercl...\n\nDeath.\n\nStanding around the fallen S’umbra, you focus your attention on Terr’ok. The bodies of his fellow priests lie scattered at your feet, limbs in unnatural positions, all mysticism absent from their now exposed faces and shattered staves. There stands only two now: you and Terr’ok.\n\n“The Raven whispers to me,” he utters. “It comes to me in my dreams. Amir’sshan is my destiny.”\n\n“Not all fates are desired,” you answer. “You dream of your death. And the nightmare is upon you.”\n\nYou charge forward, Amir’sshan becoming the state of his prison’s origin, the dagger sought after by Redding and Alexander. The man-god, trapped and buried in the Blackbird halls of the dead. The destiny of Terr’ok, high priest of the S’umbra. The artifact. Amir’sshan and the last bondsman. Terr’ok twirls his staff as if a martial monk of the Old World, the kind who spend a lifetime secluded in a monastery preparing for combat. The carved raven becomes a blur, the staff itself melding into a streak of brown. The flow emerges. It reigns above all else. The mind is of no ally here; it brings overthought, past memories that hold no place on the field of battle. All that matters is your next breath. The present. Training takes over. The flow gently soothes your mind to sleep, allowing the body to rely on its own reaction time--far quicker when operating solely. The staff twirls, attacks appearing seemingly out of nowhere from the blur.\n\nThen, understanding.\n\nThe body catches the cadence of Terr’ok’s movements like a child jumping rope. There’s a steady pace to his attacks...and a steady opening. Sure enough, all it takes is waiting for the next opening and--\n\n--the black mithril dagger, the vessel that Terr’ok’s ancestors trapped Amir’sshan within, buries deep into the priest’s neck. In an instant, the staff stops in motion, falling from Terr’ok’s hands. It falls to the cavern in a crash, bouncing from end to end before finding its final resting spot, much like its owner soon will. Terr’ok takes a step forward, his hood falling from his face. His face exposed, the priest’s eyes are wide in surprise as often is the case for one meeting their end.\n\nTerr’ok takes a final step forward, both arms stretched out, empty, seeking to land on your shoulders for support. You take a step back and let the man fall to the ground, never to rise again. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. Amir’sshan becomes an axe in your hand. The Blackbirds will demand proof of the S’umbra’s intervention. You’ll provide it.\n",
  "page 117": "They’re waiting for you as you exit the gauntlet. A man entered the trial, an outsider from across the Great Sea. The one that stands before them now is a legend, a name to be spoken for all eternity. The gauntlet of the gods is a trial few have withstood over the span of the Blackbird people--and never before has an outsider passed. Gripping Terr’ok’s severed head by his hair, loose tendrils of dripping blood mark your journey, spilling from the priest’s open neck. You raise it high for all to see.\n\nThey stand as a crowd, backed by natural ravenlight of the cave, a fitting shade for the present moment. The gauntlet opened up to the top of an underground hill. At the top, you look down at the crowd before you. It’s mostly filled with warriors, yet that much is true of the Harri’ar themselves. For the first time, they look up to you, their large size paling in comparison to the hill, both physically and symbolically. Amir’sshan, once again as a dagger, rests on your hip. He speaks through you.\n\n(Blasphemers!)\n\nCompelled by the man-god, you toss the severed head of Terr’ok into the crowd of Blackbirds. A roar erupts, the sound of rumbling thunder coaxed into existence by storm clouds. Hands grip axe handles and tighten around spear shafts. The Blackbird warriors await your (Amir’sshan’s) next words, for they will dictate whether you will be allowed to live or not.\n\n(Is this who you would worship in my absence? Priests masquerading as true devotees of the Raven, ones who would use my name for their own gain?)\n\nThe words themselves are much like the initial word screamed by Amir’sshan. Blashemper. Looks, born of puzzlement and rage, are met in return. Did the outsider claim to be the Raven? More than a few weapons are drawn now, warriors deeming your words poorly chosen, a disrespect spoken to the Raven that must be answered in blood. Several of them attack. They charge the underground hill with a cry, a scream of righteous fury to their god. You cut them down. The very spirit of Amir’sshan possesses you, and you move like the man-god himself, the chieftain of chieftains.\n\nYou discard the headdress that was placed upon your head; its feathers plucked, you have no time for impurity. It falls to the ground in the same manner of the S’umbra. Amir’sshan wishes to remain a dagger. You can work with that. You meet the charge of the Blackbird warriors, not with one of your own. Instead, you walk towards them, casually, like the way a nobleman strolls the streets of the capital city, eyeing shops and mannequins displaying the latest, finest overcoats. Their swings are telegraphed, born of rage and wildly arced. You dodge, sidestepping just out of range, mere inches away from their axes. The artifact finds a home in their necks, each Blackbird warrior felled with a single thrust of the blade, all dying by the same wound, the very one that ended the life of their leader, Terr’ok. With bodies of those in opposition around you, the words spoken from Amir’sshan have great effect, the message behind them clear: join or die.\n\n(Your god has returned. Behold! The Raven incarnate!)\n\nWhat are you doing? I thought the vessel was breaking.\n(Did I say that? Oops. I lied.)\nYou tried to have me willingly surrender my body.\n(Once again, oops.)\nYou\u0027ll not have me.\n(We’ll see about that.)\n\nThe Blackbird crowd, if they weren’t in an uproar before, now definitely are. Hands gripping weapons now raise them against one another. Like a fissure splitting the earth, the Blackbirds become two parties, one in support of Amir’sshan’s claim and the other ready to succeed where Terr\u0027ok failed. Their shouts are louder than any Alteran market, each voice seemingly louder than an Alteran quartermaster barking orders at sailors. Infighting ensues. Blackbird on Blackbird, tribe against tribe. They were united under the S’umbra’s rule. Now, however, they’re split. Able to think freely for themselves, yet their thoughts spill blood against one another.\n\nMore charge the hill, those in support of your claim at their heels, chopping at ankles and attempting to hamstring their fellow people. Through the madness E’ffy appears. Her face is like the sun peering through a cloudy day, a warm welcome in an otherwise dreary day. The tattoos are her wrists illume with magic, her holy power smiting those who stray too close, Redding next to her doing the same with his longsword. They cut their way towards you, having to avoid the pile of growing bodies at your feet.\n\n“Kid, why the hell are you claiming to be their god?” Redding shouts over the swing of his sword.\n\nBefore you can answer, E’ffy interjects. “Because Amir’sshan is seeping into him. Becoming him. The bondsman is finally fulfilling his task.”\n\n“Becoming me?” you question. “I refused his offer.”\n\nE’ffy laughs, normally a comforting sign. In this moment, however, it sends chills down your spine. It sounds wrong, somehow, an innocent tone in the face of cruelty, like a troubled child giggling as he kills small animals. “Amir’sshan does not ask. He takes. Consumes. It is the duty of the bondsman to bring the second coming.”\n\nAnger rushes into your body. Anger at being lied to. Anger at being used. After all you’ve been through, your life is thought as nothing, simply a soul in the way of the man-god’s. Damn the artifact. Damn the Blackbirds. You’re through with both. You wish that you’d never chosen to come to the war camp. Your grip tightens around the dagger. With a yell, you throw the artifact in to the sea of fighting natives. You’re done with it. Let another, a true devotee, bear the burden. You don’t even believe in the Raven, and you’re sure there’s more than a few present who would gladly surrender their life for Amir’sshan, E’ffy counted as one of them.\n\n“That’s what I think of your sacred artifact,” you shout, your voice ringing above the sounds of battle. Finally, you’re rid of the thing. Let the natives fight each other to determine the next wielder. Suddenly, weight appears in your palm, a familiar wing-tipped handle rests in your hand. A sickening feeling rumbles in your stomach, and the meal eaten the night before threatens to jump ship. The artifact, it returned.\n\n(Not so fast, hero.)\n\nEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nYour mind screams a pitch similar to Amir’sshan’s, taking on his demeanor the way spending long amounts of time with another cause picked-up habits. Seems you’re stuck with the artifact for the time being. Redding extends a worried glance in your direction; E’ffy displays the exact opposite, a constant grin at her lips. Her arm reaches out and touches your shoulder. It\u0027s comforting, reassuring.\n\n“It is a great honor to be in your service, Raven.”\n\nYou do not respond at first, though you sense Amir’sshan allowing you to do so. Allowing you. Allowing you to speak for yourself. The man-god spent centuries trapped within a prison of black mithril; it’s early, yet you have a feeling you’re taking the first few steps onto his path, the prison being your own body.\n\nNo.\n\nYou’ll not surrender easily. You never have. You’ll not start now. The battlefield has simply shaped form, much like the artifact itself. Rather than fighting by traditional means, you’ll be battling for control of your mind, of your body. You sense the disapproval within and send your own in response. One body. Two souls in constant struggle over one another. You’re not quite done living yet. There’s much you haven’t gotten around to due to military service. An entire New World lies at your feet, a freedom surpassing all that you’ve experience before. You’ll not be chained, conscripted, bound to any other. A mental surge overtakes Amir’sshan’s hands playing puppeteer. You’re in control. You’ll do as you want.\n\n“I’m not who you think I am,” you state flatly. “The man-god is under my control, not the other way around.”\n\nE’ffy’s face turns dark. Backed by ravenlight, it almost becomes formless. “Only the S’umbra threaten the Raven in that way.”\n\n“The S’umbra are no more. Same for the ‘second coming.’ There is only me and my ambition.” (EEEEEEEEEE) Turning to Redding, seeing his face still shows concern, you add, “Our task here is complete. There is much work to be done, is there not?”\n\nRedding’s expression becomes blank, his card-playing face. “There is always work to be done.”\n\n“You are leaving then,” E’ffy speaks.\n\nYou nod.\n\n“Then I am coming with you.”\n\nYou offer her another gesture. This one, a shrug.\n\n“Not a bad idea,” Redding says, “to have a Blackbird ally along with us.”\n\nE’ffy doesn’t correct the term. Old habits. You glance at the battlefield before you, the physical one. Infighting between tribes, a people raising axes and spears against one another. It is necessary for change. You have a feeling you will be doing the same with the people of the Old World as they voyage to the New. It’s the natural order of things. The Old must die for the New to survive, like a snake shedding dead skin. Within, Amir’sshan settles down, the sudden outburst from the voice calmed for a moment. The internal struggle will continue. That\u0027s for damn sure. For now, however, the external struggle must be the main focus. Blackbird warriors climb the hill towards you.\n\nBlack smoke. Thunderclouds. They climb to their death.\n\nYou’ll cut your way through the Blackbirds and leave the war camp, Redding and E’ffy along with you. The S’umbra are no more. Each Blackbird tribe is free to act on their own, and with their new-found freedom, they seek to end your life. So be it. Some lend their support, but not nearly the majority--not even near half of them. You’ll cut them down as free men; they’ve chosen their path, and you, yours. Their choice leads to a dead end. Yours, on the other hand, is just beginning. The New World awaits you. Best to not keep it waiting long.\n",
  "page 88": "The first thing that draws your attention is the wind, a howling gale that would have Alteran women holding the hats upon their heads. The second thing is the moon, full and bright, covering the world below in its lunar glow, shining far brighter than any moon you’ve witnessed before. It’s as if you’re closer, brought together by the nature of the New World. So close, in fact, that you can see and identify dimples on the moon’s surface, craters brought upon by a celestial beating.\n\nAnd the third thing, the thing that rises far over the rest, is that something is wrong. Something is very wrong.\n\nIt’s the feeling of being watched, the feeling causing you to shut your window blinds at night, the feeling brought from a pair of eyes in a crowd full of people. The hair on your arms rises, as if reaching out themselves towards the moon. Adrenaline pours throughout your body. High alert. Your eyes scan the wilderness around you; your finger rests on the six-shooter...\n\n...it’s gone. The artifact is gone. After a quick, if not rapid check for the others, you discover they are gone as well. In response, you draw cold steel. You pull the longsword from its sheath, noticing the hollowness it brings compared to the artifact. The difference between the two weapons is like a fresh batch of ale opposed to an unfinished tankard that’s been sitting out for days. But still, like the two-day old ale, it’ll do the trick in a pinch. And you’re in a goddamn pinch, to say the least.\n\nYou rise from your seat. After leaning against a rock for what, two-three hours, there’s a stiffness in your lower back. Let that be tomorrow’s issue. Tonight has plenty of its own. The moonlight affords you vision of your little camp. The fire’s long burned out, black embers and ash lie in the place where flame once danced. Prints on the ground reveal your presence. You never tried to mask them anyway. Off in the distance, the sea, the Great Sea as the Blackbirds would call it, crashes against the shore. The sound doesn’t reach you in your elevation, although your mind fills in the gap, imagining the sound each time a cloudy white line of foam touches the New World beach, the place that almost killed you with a little help from the Blackbirds.\n\nThe footsteps. They lead into the cave. Sword drawn, senses high, you follow.\n\nNot four steps in, the moon, shining brighter than it’s ever before, abandons you to darkness. You’ve stepped from its watchful gaze, from a place of light where misdeeds and lawlessness can be witnessed into a place where the shadows thrive, a place with no accountability for one’s actions. The floor is dirt. You feel its soft impact on your feet, almost sand-like, it’s so loose. You pause a moment to allow your eyes to adjust. They don’t, at least not entirely. What was dark and formless is now dark and slightly-less formless. You can’t see any hard edges, the specific shape of those sharing the cave with you, but you receive a rough outline, spots in your vision that are a shade lighter than the constant darkness. It’ll have to do.\n\nThe cave, with its serpent-like entrance, winds around a few twists and bends. Large stones line the interior, similar to the two standing guard just outside. At least that’s what you silently think they’re for; instead of royal guards, standing post outside their king’s throne room, they could be something else entirely. Jailors, for example, making sure no one escapes the cave. After a few more turns, no branching tunnels or other paths, luckily, the cave opens into a wide cavern.\n\nIt must be deep as you can’t even see the ceiling. It’s dark, and like dropping a pebble into a body of water, once it goes beyond your depth of vision, it might as well be infinite. There’s a small torch lit, however, a tiny flame standing alone against the impending darkness of the cave. It’s not a normal torch though, but it’s one that you’re well familiar with. Ravenlight. It highlights the other figures in the cavern, shadows brought to life, one free, one bound. Their backs are towards you. Even then, it’s easy to tell who they are. Who else? Redding and E’ffy.\n\nRedding is tied to a pillar. HIs arms and legs are spread like the four corners of a compass, bound at the ankles and wrists. Ravenlight dances. The sudden shift in light reveals that Redding has been stripped of all clothes, exposed to the world. More importantly, exposed to E’ffy. She remains in her tanned leather dress, standing completely still in front of Redding. Something in her hand flashes in the ravenlight. The artifact. It’s a dagger in her palm, the wing-tipped handle poking out just outside of her hand. Not that you’ve felt particularly bonded to the artifact, even if that’s the term used for unlocking its power, seeing someone else, E’ffy, holding the artifact (IT’S MINE) feels wrong. It feels very damn wrong. She speaks without turning around, perhaps sensing your presence, perhaps not caring if you watch what’s unfolding. E’ffy carries the artifact, after all. How could you dare stand up to such a power?\n\n(Worthy is the one who sacrifices himself for the Raven. Under the protective wing, the Raven covers those who follow its will. There is no greater glory than the surrendering of one’s life for the greater good.)\n\nHer voice stops you in your tracks. It’s a mixture of the woman herself and the voice you hear in your head. “E’ffy…” is all you can utter, the rest of the words lost to you.\n\n(The second coming is near. All that stands in the way of the Raven will be smote. Let the thunder ring. Let the clouds pour black rain. Its return is here.)\n\n“E’ffy,” you say a second time, finding the strength of your lungs. You grip the longsword tightly through both hands, raising it defensively. Nerves run through your body. It’s the feeling before an unavoidable argument, the feeling standing in formation waiting for the battlefield commander to wave you to march upon the enemy. The eventual battle is coming.\n\nShe finally turns around. You wish she didn’t. You wish to every god that was or has existed that she didn’t turn around, that she kept looking forward, fixed on Redding’s bound body. But she does. She turns to look at you, the one with your weapon drawn, knuckles tightly wound against the handle, the blade itself growing increasingly heavier by the second. She turns to face you, and that’s when you see her in all her passion, a religious devotion to bring the Raven’s will about by any means necessary, a hurricane of a woman destroying all in her path to do the Raven’s work.\n\nHer eyes are solid black, pupils hiding in the shadows. No. Ravenblack. E’ffy’s braid, once perfectly weaved together, is completely loosened at the end, strands of hair escaping in single-piece runaways, like the way a sister’s hair looks after a brother ruffles it for fun. A thin line sits where her mouth once did, both lips pressed together tighter than a workman’s vice. Her chest breathes heavily, bouncing up and down, something that would perhaps send your mind into a man’s imagination under normal circumstances, but this is anything but. A dark pool of sweat accompanies her dress, wet blotches near the underneath of her arms and stomach, matching the glistening drips at the base of her neck.\n\n(Would you join me in bringing about the Raven’s will?)\n\nShe--they--don’t wait for your response.\n\n(The end of the drought is here. Those who have taken up in my Father’s house will be driven from it. Wolves in sheep’s clothing. Predators in the night. They now face one far greater than their own. The Raven returns.)\n\nE’ffy’s face seems to melt, features rolling down her head like a mudslide, twisting and mixing with one another. Her skin drips from her face like melted wax from a candle that’s long been forgotten. Ravenblack feathers appear, the woman herself becoming the exact creature that she worships. Sharp talons pour from her fingers, blending in with the artifact; wings sprout at her back. The transformation is almost complete. Her eyes, no longer E’ffy’s, land on you. They\u0027re shifty, the way a bird stares, then cocks their head a few seconds at a time, far quicker than a human eye can follow. With a cry, E’ffy, the bird-like creature bears down on you. Your longsword is useless.\n",
  "page 87": "“Hey,” you whisper. Redding is softly breathing, either asleep or faking it rather well. E’ffy turns your way, whispering even lighter than Redding’s breath.\n\n“What?”\n\n“We’re arriving at the war camp tomorrow?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Have you ever had outsiders before?”\n\n“None that weren’t prisoners.”\n\n“Is this going to be the classic case where you pretend to bind us, masquerading two captured soldiers around to gain entry, while feigning as prisoners allows us to enter the camp without issue?”\n\nIt’s a good trope. Unfortunately, it hasn’t made its way to the New World quite yet. Give it a few decades, and you’re sure more than one heroic adventure will involve it. In this case, you’re stuck with solely a beautiful native princess, probably a virgin, too, if you had to guess. E’ffy voices her confusion.\n\n“I do not know of what you speak.”\n\n“Nevermind,” you say. Turning more serious, you add, “You know, this is probably the place--or at least a hill nearby--where the Blackbirds fired upon our ships. There\u0027s a perfect view of the water from here. If it were light, that is.”\n\n“Why do you call us that?” E’ffy asks, sounding truly interested. Her eyes, losing the previous glare, look at you the way a child listens to their father telling a bedtime story.\n\n“Blackbirds? I don’t know. It’s what everyone calls you back home. Has something to do with your religion. The Raven, I mean. As far as I know, there hasn’t been any friendly contact between our people. So someone along the way called the people here, your people, ‘Blackbirds,’ and that’s what we know you by. I’m sure you have a name for us outsiders.”\n\nE’ffy smiles. Her teeth shine more brilliant than any full moon you’ve witnessed. “To be polite we call you outsiders to your face...between the Harri’ar you are the tek’usans, ‘stunted pale skins.’”\n\nIt’s the same word the Blackbird warrior called you at the clearing. Your face grows long. “You’re not taller than me. Maybe just an inch or so.”\n\nShe points towards your boots. “Take those off and it is more.”\n\nRight. E’ffy walks around barefoot. The bottoms of her feet must be conditioned beyond belief, for the forest floor of the New World isn’t soft by any means. True, it’s mostly dirt. But still, rocks, roots, and thorns aren’t a rarity. You imagine it’s a little like walking barefoot in the backyard of your home, having a familiarity with the environment to the point where protection isn’t necessary. Not all backyards have poisonous plants and wild animals though. E’ffy’s might, but yours sure as hell doesn’t--didn’t.\n\n“Fair enough,” you answer. “Tell me something as our lives are in your hands… Are you in good standing with the tribe? If we are going to help you take the false priests out of the picture, will there be support from any others?”\n\n“Mmm,” E’ffy ponders, fingers grasping at the single braid down the side of her face in thought. “Very few. My beliefs are...traditional. They hold true to the sect of the Raven that has brought us flourishment. The S’umbra are different. They bind the chieftains together like a crude water raft, riding safely atop while our people take the brunt of the waves.”\n\n“If you are a priestess, then you must have a temple. Is it large? Do many (Blackbirds) visit?”\n\n“It is sizable, yes,” E’ffy says. “I believe I already answered that question.”\n\nVery few. Great. So you’re about to bring religious revolution to a native people that have currently assembled all their tribes together to hunt the very thing that rests on your hip, the artifact. Amir’sshan. The fucking whipped cream on top of the pie is that the people, the natives themselves, aren’t in support of the revolution. If anything, you’re attempting a tyrannous overthrow, backed with six shots in the chamber and a ravenblack blade. Though to be fair, that’s probably how the S’umbra came into power in the first place. Power begets power. Once you gain momentum, perhaps the tribesmen will turn towards the cause. The cause...what exactly in the fuck is the cause? The individual. Collective thinking, a poison upon both the New and Old World.\n\n“E’ffy, I have so many more questions for you,” you say, exhaustion settling in.\n\n“Save them for tomorrow. Tonight we need rest.”\n\nTruer words have never been spoken. The warmth of the fire lulls you to sleep, normally something that doesn’t come easy. Tonight, it hits you like a gust of wind. Absent one moment, then present--in full force--the next. The last thing you remember is E’ffy mindlessly running her fingers down her braid. And comfort. Comfort from the fire. Comfort from companionship. It’s not a feeling you’re used to.\n",
  "page 119": "There’s no telling how soon the garrison will be sent packing to the Old World. You don’t have time to find out either. You need to act, and fast. You scan the crowd of Magda soldiers, looking for a doc. Off in the distance, you hear a laugh echo from the ramparts, followed by clinking of tea cups. Rules of war, you know. Still, it seems a tad insensitive for the garrison’s leader to show such obvious enjoyment while his men are herded like farm animals.\n\nFinally your eyes land on a man near the edge of the soldiers. His build is thin. Like Benjamin, and a lot of the Magda soldiers, his features are sharp, a thin pair of spectacles sitting at the edge of his pointy nose. One look and you know he’s not a soldier like the rest. Arms are too frail for a sword. Better suited for a scalpel. He’s the small puppy barking directions at war horses. Just what you need.\n\n(I’ve seen that look in many mortals before. You’re about to get us into trouble, aren’t you?)\nNo more than usual.\n\nYou hear the sound of Benjamin spitting as you walk away from the man. At least he’s content to stay put. You don’t need him following you around and causing problems. You imagine you’ll have enough problems of your own, by your own making no less. Through the crowd of Magda soldiers you go, taking notice that you are the only one in motion. The rest simply stand around, waiting. They’re about to have a hell of another show.\n\nThe man’s hair is in the process of becoming more silver than brown, straight and combed back. Not long enough to be tied, but close. He notices you approach as most of the soldiers do. “A man could get nervous with a fellow approaching like that,” he says lightly. The good-natured voice likely has calmed more than a few “excited” patients in his day.\n\n“Perhaps in the dark of night. Here, however…” you display your arms out towards the hundreds of eyes upon you.\n\n“What is it you want.” The doc abandons his friendly opening.\n\n“Spear wound under the arm. Clean, but deep. Very deep. Marginal loss of blood. How long can a man last?” you ask.\n\nThe sudden question relating to his expertise draws the doc from his antagonist demeanor. He scratches his chin. “For a soldier in good health, assuming that’s what you mean. Hmm. Oh I’d not give the man more than a day unless treated properly.”\n\n“Good. That’s all I needed to know.” You fumble with your hands a bit to draw the doc’s eyes downward.\n\nNow comes the fun part.\n(Comparatively, I sense.)\n\nYou move quickly, far quicker than the doc can react to. You slide your body forward, while still keeping proper posture, the only movement a slight shifting of your feet, without long, winding motions of your body. The doc’s gaze still down, he doesn’t register it until it’s too late. The bridge of your nose rams straight into the doc’s forehead. By all intents and purposes, without the eyes deft enough to catch the entirety of the motion, it appears that the field surgeon headbutted you, a cheap shot.\n\nYou withdraw with, perhaps, too much of a dramatic flair, but it’s attention you seek. And attention is damn well what you receive.\n\n“Bastard!” you shout, clutching at your nose.\n\nThe doc doesn’t seem to realize what is happening, and why should he? Who asks a medical question and then rams the soft part of their face into another’s skull? He certainly doesn’t realize you’re firing “back” a shot of your own until your fist slams into his gut, doubling him over. You avoid his head for obvious reasons. He still needs his wits about him to heal Redding. Also, nine times out of ten an opponent doubled over will--\n\n--his body tackles yours to the ground. The odds land true. His shoulder lands in your stomach, sending an audible groan along with your air from your lungs. You eat a punch. And another. You take one more before hooking the doc’s arm, trapping it, before reversing the position. Any time now... They don’t break you up right away so you take the opportunity to place both hands around the man’s throat, not tight enough to choke him completely, but just enough to make him squirm. Finally, you’re pulled up by an Alteran under each arm.\n\n“Did you see that? He headbutted me for no reason!” you yell, playing the part of the righteously wronged. The blood pouring from your nostril adds a nice effect.\n\n“The boy is mad,” the doc spits back.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who started it,” an Alteran soldier says, dressed in navy blue. The statement flows with the ease of a father. “You’re soldiers. Act like it. Now I want you to sit quietly until the meeting is over. Or else.” He gestures towards the two captains sharing a pot of tea on the ramparts.\n\n“No! I won’t let this...poor excuse for a surgeon get away with it! He let three of my friends die, and then attacked me when I brought it up.”\n\n(Ease back, fellow.)\n\n“I have no idea what he’s talking about!” the doc exclaims. “I have never seen him before in my life.”\n\n“ENOUGH,” the Alteran’s voice booms across the garrison. In the corner of your eye, you see the tea party casually glance your way. “You two give me no choice.” The soldier motions to a few others, who wander over. A group of them huddle together, deciding your fate. It seems they will collectively decide to lock you in the dungeon as none possess the rank to decide it by themselves. After a few moments of whispering and head nodding, your favorite Alteran soldier returns.\n\n“You’re going in a place where you can’t cause any more disruption. Your uncivilized behavior, the both of yours, means you’re a danger to others. If you’re going to behave like animals, you’ll be locked up like animals.”\n\nThen he says a few words that wipe the internal grin from your mind.\n\n“The hanging cages for you two.”\n\nYour actions have gotten you locked up alright. Locked up in a single cage suspended from the top of the fort for all to see. The lock is not troubling. The constant supervision of a thousand soldiers, is. You doubt the artifact gives the ability to fight an entire battalion. The cage is irrelevant. But still, you’re not going anywhere for a while.\n",
  "page 89": "The first thing that draws your attention is the wind, a howling gale that would have Alteran women holding the hats upon their heads. The second thing is the moon, full and bright, covering the world below in its lunar glow, shining far brighter than any moon you’ve witnessed before. It’s as if you’re closer, brought together by the nature of the New World. So close, in fact, that you can see and identify dimples on the moon’s surface, craters brought upon by a celestial beating.\n\nAnd the third thing, the thing that rises far over the rest, is that something is wrong. Something is very wrong.\n\nIt’s the feeling of being watched, the feeling causing you to shut your window blinds at night, the feeling brought from a pair of eyes in a crowd full of people. The hair on your arms rises, as if reaching out themselves towards the moon. Adrenaline pours throughout your body. High alert. Your eyes scan the wilderness around you; your finger rests on the six-shooter...\n\n...it’s gone. The artifact is gone. After a quick, if not rapid check for the others, you discover they are gone as well. In response, you draw cold steel. You pull the longsword from its sheath, noticing the hollowness it brings compared to the artifact. The difference between the two weapons is like a fresh batch of ale opposed to an unfinished tankard that’s been sitting out for days. But still, like the two-day old ale, it’ll do the trick in a pinch. And you’re in a goddamn pinch, to say the least.\n\nYou rise from your seat. After leaning against a rock for what, two-three hours, there’s a stiffness in your lower back. Let that be tomorrow’s issue. Tonight has plenty of its own. The moonlight affords you vision of your little camp. The fire’s long burned out, black embers and ash lie in the place where flame once danced. Prints on the ground reveal your presence. You never tried to mask them anyway. Off in the distance, the sea, the Great Sea as the Blackbirds would call it, crashes against the shore. The sound doesn’t reach you in your elevation, although your mind fills in the gap, imagining the sound each time a cloudy white line of foam touches the New World beach, the place that almost killed you with a little help from the Blackbirds.\n\nThe footsteps. They lead into the cave. Sword drawn, senses high, you follow.\n\nNot four steps in, the moon, shining brighter than it’s ever before, abandons you to darkness. You’ve stepped from its watchful gaze, from a place of light where misdeeds and lawlessness can be witnessed into a place where the shadows thrive, a place with no accountability for one’s actions. The floor is dirt. You feel its soft impact on your feet, almost sand-like, it’s so loose. You pause a moment to allow your eyes to adjust. They don’t, at least not entirely. What was dark and formless is now dark and slightly-less formless. You can’t see any hard edges, the specific shape of those sharing the cave with you, but you receive a rough outline, spots in your vision that are a shade lighter than the constant darkness. It’ll have to do.\n\nThe cave, with its serpent-like entrance, winds around a few twists and bends. Large stones line the interior, similar to the two standing guard just outside. At least that’s what you silently think they’re for; instead of royal guards, standing post outside their king’s throne room, they could be something else entirely. Jailors, for example, making sure no one escapes the cave. After a few more turns, no branching tunnels or other paths, luckily, the cave opens into a wide cavern.\n\nIt must be deep as you can’t even see the ceiling. It’s dark, and like dropping a pebble into a body of water, once it goes beyond your depth of vision, it might as well be infinite. There’s a small torch lit, however, a tiny flame standing alone against the impending darkness of the cave. It’s not a normal torch though, but it’s one that you’re well familiar with. Ravenlight. It highlights the other figures in the cavern, shadows brought to life, one free, one bound. Their backs are towards you. Even then, it’s easy to tell who they are. Who else? Redding and E’ffy.\n\nRedding is tied to a pillar. HIs arms and legs are spread like the four corners of a compass, bound at the ankles and wrists. Ravenlight dances. The sudden shift in light reveals that Redding has been stripped of all clothes, exposed to the world. More importantly, exposed to E’ffy. She remains in her tanned leather dress, standing completely still in front of Redding. Something in her hand flashes in the ravenlight. The artifact. It’s a dagger in her palm, the wing-tipped handle poking out just outside of her hand. Not that you’ve felt particularly bonded to the artifact, even if that’s the term used for unlocking its power, seeing someone else, E’ffy, holding the artifact (IT’S MINE) feels wrong. It feels very damn wrong. She speaks without turning around, perhaps sensing your presence, perhaps not caring if you watch what’s unfolding. E’ffy carries the artifact, after all. How could you dare stand up to such a power?\n\n(Worthy is the one who sacrifices himself for the Raven. Under the protective wing, the Raven covers those who follow its will. There is no greater glory than the surrendering of one’s life for the greater good.)\n\nHer voice stops you in your tracks. It’s a mixture of the woman herself and the voice you hear in your head. “E’ffy…” is all you can utter, the rest of the words lost to you.\n\n(The second coming is near. All that stands in the way of the Raven will be smote. Let the thunder ring. Let the clouds pour black rain. Its return is here.)\n\n“E’ffy,” you say a second time, finding the strength of your lungs. You grip the longsword tightly through both hands, raising it defensively. Nerves run through your body. It’s the feeling before an unavoidable argument, the feeling standing in formation waiting for the battlefield commander to wave you to march upon the enemy. The eventual battle is coming.\n\nShe finally turns around. You wish she didn’t. You wish to every god that was or has existed that she didn’t turn around, that she kept looking forward, fixed on Redding’s bound body. But she does. She turns to look at you, the one with your weapon drawn, knuckles tightly wound against the handle, the blade itself growing increasingly heavier by the second. She turns to face you, and that’s when you see her in all her passion, a religious devotion to bring the Raven’s will about by any means necessary, a hurricane of a woman destroying all in her path to do the Raven’s work.\n\nHer eyes are solid black, pupils hiding in the shadows. No. Ravenblack. E’ffy’s braid, once perfectly weaved together, is completely loosened at the end, strands of hair escaping in single-piece runaways, like the way a sister’s hair looks after a brother ruffles it for fun. A thin line sits where her mouth once did, both lips pressed together tighter than a workman’s vice. Her chest breathes heavily, bouncing up and down, something that would perhaps send your mind into a man’s imagination under normal circumstances, but this is anything but. A dark pool of sweat accompanies her dress, wet blotches near the underneath of her arms and stomach, matching the glistening drips at the base of her neck.\n\n(Would you join me in bringing about the Raven’s will?)\n\nShe--they--don’t wait for your response.\n\n(The end of the drought is here. Those who have taken up in my Father’s house will be driven from it. Wolves in sheep’s clothing. Predators in the night. They now face one far greater than their own. The Raven returns.)\n\nE’ffy’s face seems to melt, features rolling down her head like a mudslide, twisting and mixing with one another. Her skin drips from her face like melted wax from a candle that’s long been forgotten. Ravenblack feathers appear, the woman herself becoming the exact creature that she worships. Sharp talons pour from her fingers, blending in with the artifact; wings sprout at her back. The transformation is almost complete. Her eyes, no longer E’ffy’s, land on you. They\u0027re shifty, the way a bird stares, then cocks their head a few seconds at a time, far quicker than a human eye can follow. With a cry, E’ffy, the bird-like creature bears down on you. Your longsword is useless.\n",
  "page 80": "The one wielding the axes must be taken down first. He possesses the most danger. You’re witnessing first-hand the ability to continue with a spear wound. An axe wound--or several--may not be as manageable. You eye the axe heads, sharpened stone to a razor’s edge, tied with leather to the wooden handle. One hit from either, and you’d be done, the head creating a deep, lengthy wound, a deadly one at that. But still, you must keep an eye on the spear as well. Can’t be too focused on what’s in front of you, not on a battlefield.\n\nSwinging with one arm, you attempt to use the length of your sword against the axe. Your weapon has more reach. The surface area of its blade is much greater. Without both hands to support the weapon, however, you’re forced to use wide sweeps and swings, creating force with the weapon’s momentum. If the warrior in front of you bore a shield, it’d be for naught. Two axes, not much in terms of defense-ability, the tactic is sound.\n\nPain throbs at your shoulder. Your right arm starts to tire. Still, you attack.\n\nThe Blackbird is able to deflect your assault, sliding back just out of reach from your follow up attack. You swing, he parries and steps back. Rinse and repeat. The skirmish takes you further into the war party’s forces, away from Redding and the scouts, too contained with their own skirmishes to aid. You realize what is happening, although you’re also aware what happens if you stop the assault. As long as you continue attacking, your opponent cannot return his own, especially when he does not have time between parries.\n\nThe tactic is sound, save for the other Blackbird warriors. They know your death is near. Deep within your mind, you know it as well, but you aren’t willing to acknowledge the thought. The others allow you to continue the duel with the axe bearer, interested in who will reign victorious. At least most of them are. Movement flashes in the edge of your vision. Instinctively, mid-attack, your left hand reaches for your flintlock. You scream in pain, but still, somehow, manage to draw the weapon and cock back the hammer.\n\nClick. Nothing.\n\nClick. Nothing.\n\nClick, click, click. The flintlock is empty; you weren’t able to reload after the latest firing. The new Blackbird understands this, a smile forming at his lips. He towers above you. They all do, gathering closer and closer. Like the forest canopy preventing sunlight from reaching the surface, the Blackbird warriors do the same to you. They draw near.\n\nClick. Nothing.\n",
  "page 81": "The one wielding the spear must be taken down first. He possesses the most danger. Case in point, the spear shaft that’s still sticking from your shoulder. The weapon has more reach than your longsword; the Blackbird behind it could poke and prod and keep you at distance while the axes close in. He must be taken down first.\n\nWith one arm you swing forward, taking the offensive while careful not to allow another point to find its way through your defenses. You’re able to keep going for now, but another wound like the one at your shoulder would mean certain death. The spear, sharpened stone to a razor’s edge, deflects your attacks, the shaft itself taking the majority. A few more swings, a few more deflections.\n\nThen, the counter.\n\nA flurry of stabs. You barely have time to register them. Your left arm useless, you’re unable to keep up with just your right, so instead of parrying them all, you give ground. It’s all you can do, unless the shoulder wound wants friends. However, the act brings you deeper and deeper into the war party, far away from Redding and the scouts. Mid-parry, a nervous feeling starts in the pit of your stomach, like the sudden news of a family member passing. In a way, it’s the very same: the death, your own.\n\nEach step back, each foot further into the war party, you’re acutely aware of the circumstance. Stand ground, die. Give ground, delay the inevitable. But damn if you won’t go taking a few more warriors with you. The others, a gathering crowd, stand and watch, interested to see who will reign victorious. A mistake in battle. You jump back, farther than ever before outside of the spear’s range. Wildly, you arc your longsword behind you in a series of cuts. Three spectators fall.\n\nThe act furies the war party. You might have just spat on one of their customs, three warriors finding themselves in the splash zone. Duel be damned. They close in, a mob of angry natives chopping their axes, stabbing their spears. Off in the distance you hear Redding shout your name. Just before the Blackbird warriors shut your vision completely, you see recognition on Prinn’s face. He remembers. You die.\n",
  "page 84": "You sprint back towards the garrison quicker than your retreat. The prodding of a war party heading in your direction isn’t as much as your leader, perhaps a friend, bleeding out. Your side aches. Your legs feel as if running on sand. But still, they are small nuisances compared to the feeling Redding has. It’s not a day’s journey by any means. However, you’re acutely aware of possible complications upon arriving back to the garrison. Returning without your scout escorts--possibly labeled a deserter. You wonder if Alexander’s protection will still fall on you without the former corporal. Benjamin, for instance, probably wouldn’t mind another crack at you. First, you’ve got to arrive at the garrison. The complications come second.\n\nHalfway there, you realize that you never re-holstered your flintlock. It’s probably ruined by water damage by now, not that you need it any longer. The artifact seems to fulfill that category, and more. You briefly entertain dumping your longsword as well as it’s unnecessary weight. Surely, the artifact can become one.\n\n(I can.)\nThanks for your input.\n\nThe voice can hear your thoughts somehow. You’re bonded in a manner you can’t explain. Even when it’s silent, you can feel its presence, a low humming of energy ready to be unleashed. After Redding is taken care of, you plan to have a long conversation with the voice inside your head, not a comforting thought in the least. Redding mentioned ale. Yes, you imagine there will be plenty of that when the time comes. You arrive back to the edge of the treeline. The garrison lies ahead. The soldiers that occupy the former battlefield are not of Magda. They are not Blackbirds. They wear long blue overcoats, buttons of gold. Their boots rise nearly up to their knees.\n\nThe Alteran battalion.\n\nA grin comes across your face as you step forward, but then stop. You glance down, taking a double glance at your attire. Sure enough, it’s the one issued by the Magda quartermaster. A thousand soldiers of your allegiance stand in front of you, and yet you cannot draw upon them for help. You wear the colors of the enemy. You’ve hurried here, only taking a fraction of time. Patience will serve you now. There’s no sense in rushing in. Let the scene play out before you, then act accordingly. If only you weren’t wearing red while trying to hide in the forest. Oh well. The battalion stands in formation just outside the gate, which still boasts a sizable hole in the center, although the fire’s long been put out.\n\nWe’ve got some time. Speak.\n(Another mortal who thinks me his pet. Cute.)\nYou possess sentience. Is that of your own doing?\n(How refreshing of a question. I’m used to ‘can you do this? Can you do that?’ difficult question to answer there.)\nIt’s straightforward enough.\n(You possess sentience. Is it of your own doing?)\n...fair enough. Was there a time that you did not occupy the artifact?\n(That, is a better question. Once upon a time, I had a body of my own.)\nWhat happened?\n(A story for another time. I believe your attention is needed elsewhere.)\n\nCrouched under the cover of trees, you see Alexander emerge from the fort, two soldiers at his side. Surrendering? It’s hard to tell with his back turned towards you, but the commanding officer leading the Alteran battalion appears to be Briggs. Same height. Same build. Strange that the Alterans are content to stand outside of the gate when the Magda garrison is in obvious poor condition. The rules of war don’t state anything against taking advantage of an opponent. In fact, it encourages it as long as they are treated humanely.\n\n“The two tribes are now one.”\n\nA woman’s voice speaks behind you, heavily accented. As such, each word bears deliberate articulation, similar to the way the Blackbird warrior spoke not hours before. The voice sounds familiar. You turn to find the same Blackbird woman that you encountered days ago. You’re starting to think it may not be a coincidence. She’s dressed in the same tanned leather, feet bare, displaying tattoos around her wrists and ankles. Long black hair flows down her back, a single braid running down the side of her face. Unarmed, just as before.\n\nYou suppress your initial questions for now. “No. They’re bitter enemies. They’d never join as allies.”\n\n“What is that then?”\n\nGlancing back at the fort, you catch Alexander and Briggs clasping hands. Partnership? No, it still could be conquest. Terms of surrender must have been met, and the two leaders are shaking in agreement, like the way a merchant would to a supplier. “That could mean many things,” you say.\n\n“Axes greet enemy. Words greet friends.”\n\nIt’s a strange take on a well-known saying. In common, save your words for friends, enemies deserve only the sword. The quote is old. If you paid more attention to your studies as a youth you might remember how old or who it’s attributed to, not that it would really make a difference in the present moment.\n\n(She’s a priestess. Devoted to an older sect of the Raven by her markings.)\n\n“And which one are you?” you ask.\n\nShe smiles, gesturing with her arms. It’s like the sun peeking through a cloudy day. “Do you see an axe?”\n\n“Fair enough,” you answer. “Listen, any other time I’d love to sit down and chat. Buy you an ale, maybe. But my...friend is wounded and needs help. I came to find a healer.”\n\n“Which tribe?”\n\n“Good question…” you answer trailing off in thought.\n\nShe’s smart, this one. On your first encounter, you wore the long coat of Alteran. This time, however, you’re in Magda crimson. There may be a peace brokered between nations, even if that’s in the form of surrender, but spies, turncoats can still expect no mercy, especially those who traded their coat for the losing color. The Alteran arrival may complicate things more than you first expected. Magda won’t stick their neck out for you. None but perhaps Alexander favors you, and that’s only by association with Redding. Alteran hangs turncoats. Yes, the arrival of the battalion is problematic, indeed.\n\n“I have seen this before,” the woman says. “Tribes becoming one with a single enemy in mind. It is happening now.”\n\n“You think they’re reuniting against the Blackbirds?” You don’t mean to call her that. Hopefully it doesn’t sound like an insult or slur. It just sort of slipped out.\n\n“We are the Harri’ar,” she answers sharply, sunshine now hiding behind storm clouds. “Many tribes have been made one under the S’umbra, false priests.” She spits on the ground, similarly to the way an Alteran soldier would after the mentioning of Fargrave, although that habit is likely vanished here.\n\n“And you do not agree with the S’umbra?”\n\n“No!” The outburst causes you to glance back to the soldiers. None seem to have heard. Mentally you take a note not to bring up the S’umbra again, at least if you can avoid it. She speaks again, more calmly. “They are poisoning the minds of the chieftains. They have twisted the Raven to their own pursuit.” The woman doesn’t exactly say “the Raven.” You’re aware the words from her mouth sounded different, yet the artifact somehow translated it in real time.\n\n“Listen,” you say for a second time. “I really can’t delay any longer. My friend.”\n\n“We have healers,” the woman states, the rest of her meaning is understood. She awaits your response. Could be easier than convincing two nations that you’re not a turncoat. Could be a trap. Could be both solutions are not ideal. Could be that you need to make a decision, fast. Could be that Redding doesn’t have much time.\n",
  "page 86": "“The S’umbra have taken over. They have poisoned the mind of the chieftains. The tribes are united, yes. But they are bound under the false priests’ rule.”\n\nThe similarity is not lost on you and Redding. The ways of the Old might not be limited solely to the world itself. It seeps in, the corruption of leadership, a steady deluding until the creek is pure no more. You need only to look around you to be reminded of that fact. A place once peaceful, unstained with blood is littered with the fallen. Perhaps that’s the byproduct of civilization. No, there’s more to it than that. Evil men taking power, allowed to. Without common men standing up, they’re allowed to flourish in their closed-fist approach. Reddish’s, Redding’s, your mission can first be accomplished with the natives on the land. The New World in its rampant overgrowth seems to have a few thorns, a thicket choking the lifeblood of the Blackbirds. The Blackbird priests, the false ones, need to be pruned, cut away from their constricting path. First with the Blackbirds, then, perhaps with native allies at your back, you can turn your attention to the soldiers from the Old World.\n\nReceiving Redding’s approval, you answer E’ffy. “We’ll do what we can.”\n\n(Ever the hero. I once was like that. We have a lot in common, you and I.)\nExcept I’m not considered a god.\n(Just a title. Nothing more, nothing less. I sense the Harri’ar will not approve of my bonding.)\nI have a feeling they won’t approve of anything when it comes to me.\n(You and the girl, you mean?)\nDid I say me and the girl?\n(It was implied.)\nYou’re reading into things.\n(Eyes on the prize, hero. There’ll always be another set of tits. Trust me.)\n\nE’ffy waits for you to continue. If she has knowledge of the artifact and its power, then she shouldn’t be surprised by instances where you apparently space out...you might need to check your surroundings more when the voice speaks. No, not the voice; the god trapped in a cage, one that has bonded with you for some reason. Amir’sshan, E’ffy called him. Hey, having the six-shooter isn’t a bad deal, especially when compared to the standard issued Alteran flintlock. The voice is simply an annoying side-effect. Nothing more, nothing less, as it would say.\n\n“The war party hunts the artifact?” You phrase your statement as more of a question.\n\nE’ffy answers, “Yes.”\n\n“Then wouldn’t returning back with you be heading straight for our deaths?”\n\nShe smiles. “Under my protection you will be safe. The Raven extends a protective wing over those who do its work.”\n\n“Yeah, but I’m not so sure the others will see it that way. They are ‘false priests’ after all. Who’s to say they won’t bend the law to…” You make a motion with your finger across your throat.\n\nThe motion causes E’ffy to laugh. It’s a pleasant sound, a clearing in the forest, an oasis in the desert. “Then they would have to…” She runs her finger across her own throat. “...me as well.”\n\nA reassuring statement if you ever heard one. “Alright then. That settles that,” you say, a meaningless comment in its own right. “Ladies first.”\n\nE’ffy eyes you puzzlingly, likely not hearing the phrase uttered before. Once it registers, she takes off from the creek. Ignoring the fallen Blackbird warriors that you slayed. It’s a nice place, not the first, and it sure as hell won’t be the last to be ruined by mankind. You make it a point to discover a similar place...and leave it pristine. Beautiful. There’s bound to be many such areas in the New World, yet untouched by civilization. The creek softly sings its farewell as you take off after E’ffy, a sad song of melancholy and loss, the cries of an innocent victim.\n\nE’ffy leads you through the forest. You and Redding follow behind, single file. She takes you straight into the heart, journeying farther away from Frontrunner’s and the garrison. If you could see through the canopy, you’d see that you’re heading uphill. The overgrowth masks the climb some; you’re already needing to step over fallen trees and wayward roots, the forest floor on the other side being at a slightly higher level than where you came. Part of you wonders if you’re walking towards your execution. E’ffy seems to know what she’s doing, however. After all, she healed Redding’s fatal wound in mere seconds. The woman could have more surprises; women often do. And there’s still the matter of the god trapped in your dagger…one with a, let’s say, unconventional demeanor.\n\nShe leads you to a cave overlooking the sea. From the elevation, you’re afforded vision over the trees from which you just traveled. They look as if blades of grass, unlike their towering trunks when standing next to them. Here, though, here they are small specks in your vision, nothing but pine needles, small green-tipped matches. Leaving the forest canopy, you’re left in the same darkness. This one is a true dusk, not the false dusklight of the thick leaves. Two great rocks rest on either side of the cave’s opening, like soldiers standing guard for their king. Starlight starts its first shimmer, the way a small diamond would sparkle turning it over from different angles. Soon the sky would be full.\n\nE’ffy does not travel with any equipment. All you and Redding have are your weapons, waterskin, and a few odds and ends that fit in your belt pouch. More odds than ends, matches included. After receiving approval from E’ffy--campfires draw attention, unwanted or no--you flick one and light a small flame just outside the cave’s mouth. Orange glow meets dusklight. Warmth fights the creeping coldness of night. E’ffy didn’t disclose if you’re close to the Blackbird tribe or not. You’re assuming not if you’re stopping here for the night, although arriving in the middle of the night with two Old World soldiers probably wouldn’t sit well with the Blackbird warriors. Likely you’d be greeted with an axe. Or hundreds.\n\nYou settle down next to the flame. No bedroll or pillow for your head, so instead, you use one of the great rocks to lean against. E’ffy takes a place next to you. Redding, unsurprisingly, takes the other rock for himself uttering something about a boat only having two oars.\n\n“If your tribesmen haven’t spotted us before, they surely have now,” you comment, eyes glued on the flame. A piece of wood cracks in the fire as you finish your last word.\n\n“They have spotted us hours ago,” E’ffy says. “I told you, the Raven--”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, takes those under his wings of protection,” you cut her off. E’ffy glares at you in response. Framed within the part of her black hair are two smoldering orbs, pupils as dark as the artifact you carry.\n\n“You would do well not to mock the Raven.”\n\n“Who says anything about mocking? You’ve lectured me on your doctrine before.”\n\n(Yeah! You tell her!)\n\nE’ffy continues her glare, gauging your intentions. From what you can tell, she settles on mistrustful forgiveness. Or something like that. Something about her look says, I’ll let this one slide. Next time, however…\n\n“Why don’t you two kids get some sleep,” Redding says from across the cave’s opening. Speaking of the cave, no one in your little trio went to explore it. There could be wild animals inside. Or worse, angry Blackbirds. In either case, the artifact would appear in your palm, a small thundercloud along with it, and death would rain from the six-shooter’s chamber. Your other companion flashes you a look much different from E’ffy’s. Two hour shifts. You take first. It’s a traditional sleep watch schedule. Makes for a low energy day the next, but better to have low energy than no energy, life (and energy) taken away in the unsuspecting night by blade.\n",
  "page 85": "You know it’s the best choice. It seems like the only option that doesn’t put you immediately in the gallows. There’s a chance it puts you in the Blackbird equivalent--whatever that may be--but that’s all it is, a chance. Approaching the fort is all but guaranteeing your fate, Redding’s along with it. No, you’ll have to trust the Blackbird woman, who appears friendly enough. You silently wonder if her beauty is swaying your decision. It probably is, truthfully. Good-looking people always tend to be more persuasive.\n\n“Alright then,” you say, taking one last glance toward the fort. “I could use the help of your healers. My friend’s nearby. We best hurry.”\n\n“Show me the way,” the Blackbird woman answers.\n\n(Surprising that you side with the beautiful priestess.)\nSend your judgement elsewhere, voice.\n(You’re mistaken--I would have done the exact same thing.)\nGlad that I know I have your approval.\n(My approval? No. I just said I would have chosen the same.)\n\nYou notice the woman looking at you expectantly. Two hazel eyes stare intently through a frame of black hair, the eyes themselves shining brightly for the dark shade. If you’re going to have internal conversations in your head, it’d be best not to be more aware of your surroundings, and those that are watching.\n\n“This way,” you say, turning back towards the creek. The Blackbird woman follows.\n\nThe journey is traveled mostly in silence. Your mind is occupied with other things rather than conversation, the top of the list being the sudden Alteran appearance. If there was any hope of returning back to the battalion and explaining the situation, it\u0027s gone now. No doubt Captain Briggs will find your former company members locked up in the dungeon who will have a condemning tale towards you and Redding. There’s no returning back to either Old World superpower unless it’s with Redding’s head in one hand and a white flag in the other. You have but a single ally left in both the Old and the New World. Redding. Or do I have two now?\n\nThe woman is happy to remain quiet. If only Alteran women possessed the same quality...the inappropriate joke, both for the situation and content, brings a slight grin to your lips. Somehow things seem funnier when they shouldn’t be, like recalling a punchline at a funeral or getting the giggles during prayer. Jokes aside, you’re grateful to travel in silence. It’s a new (New?) change of pace. In Alteran not speaking with someone in your proximity is considered rude. The Blackbirds don’t appear to be bound by such a rule, speaking only when necessary. Either that or you’ve grossly overestimated the woman’s ability to speak in the common language. Likely not though.\n\nSome time later you arrive back at the creek. The Blackbird woman--perhaps you should ask for her name--eyes the fallen native warriors, but doesn’t address it, seeming to figure out the events that transpired in the once-peaceful clearing. It was a bit of a gamble, bringing her here to Redding. After all, the man is only wounded due to fighting her own people. But you imagine the apparent disagreement, even hatred, towards the S’umbra are far greater. If the fallen warriors were following the false priests, then she’d be more than willing to offer aid.\n\nYou reveal the hidden door, hoping that showing the secret entrance to a native won’t come back to haunt you, and come face-to-face with a sword point. Redding’s. The man behind the sword is in bad shape. Sweat drips down the side of his face, like that of a day laborer during a heat wave. After recognizing you, the sword lowers.\n\n“Shoulda said it was you,” Redding manages, his card face increasingly falling. “And look, you’ve brought a friend.”\n\nThe Blackbird woman--you should really ask her name--steps past you, gently moving your body out of the way with a guiding hand on your shoulder. She examines Redding for a moment, taking in his condition. She utters incoherent words under her breath, ones that not even the artifact picks up and translates for you. She doesn’t speak to Redding, just waves a hand motioning him to lie down.\n\n“So you’re one of those clerics. Got it,” a supine Redding chuckles.\n\n“Silence,” is all the woman says to him. She turns to you next. “Bring water. Make sure it is upstream of the…” She says another native word that appears “fallen” in your mind. Even without the artifact’s translation, you’d be able to understand by the context. That and only the village idiot would draw water downstream from bodies currently poisoning the creek. You leave with waterskin in-hand to draw from the creek. Blue light glows softly in the tunnel’s exit as you turn, healing magic emanating from the priestesses’ palms. The tattoos on her wrists and ankles shine the same, the markings on her body being for more than simple looks. The woman’s head raises in concentration, her eyes closed. That’s all you need to see. You rush to fill up the waterskin, stepping to a section of the creek far from the skirmish that took place earlier, perhaps a little too far, but better safe than sorry. It takes less than two minutes before you’re back to the hidden door, waterskin full of fresh creek water.\n\nIt takes less than two minutes for the woman to heal Redding’s wound. As you return, your eyes draw to the wound at Redding’s side. It’s almost completely gone. The place where red ran openly, threatening to burst through your makeshift tourniquet, is a dark crimson, the color of dried blood as the body seeks to naturally close its own wound. With the proper medical attention of an Alteran field surgeon, this sort of recovery would take days, less of course with holy magic, but magic healers are few and far between in Alteran, certainly not taking place in battle for the common soldier. In less than two minutes, the Blackbird woman has Redding almost completely healed, although you imagine there might be a constant ache in his ribs for a few days.\n\n“Here, drink this,” you say, offering the water to Redding. Before he can outstretch his arm, the priestess snatches it from your hand. She takes a swig, and another, and another. As she drinks, you and Redding glance at each other, both giving the eyeball equivalent of a shrug. Soon, the waterskin is empty again, a small dribble of water running down from the woman’s lips. She offers the waterskin back to you, which you take and immediately head back to the creek.\n\nThis time, it takes you two even minutes to return, no longer worried about rushing for Redding’s sake. After looking at the woman, gaining her silent approval, you offer the waterskin to Redding. He reaches out, and before his fingers can touch the waterskin, you pull it back, chugging it in its entirety. It’s not a small pouch by any means, and you have a few-found respect for the Blackbird woman. Luckily, your years of downing much stronger liquid, a skill acquired in the military, serves you well. The startled look on Redding’s face is worth the cause, incoming stomach ache or no.\n\n“You two are meant for each other,” Redding comments. “Now go on, you can’t expect a wounded man to draw his own water. Bet you didn’t think that far ahead, did ya?”\n\nThe woman simply shrugs. With a sigh, you stand and head to fill the waterskin for the third time. This time, it takes nearly three minutes. You feel a steady onset of a stomach ache approaching, although it may just be in your mind for briefly thinking about it moments earlier, like when a family member becomes sick and suddenly every itch in your throat sets off warning bells. You did it as a joke, but silently you wonder why the woman took the water first. Not to say the native people of the New World are without humor--it’s just not what you expected. But also that’s the best time for humor, in your opinion. What did the bartender say to the horse? Why the long face?\n\nAs you return back, you say to the woman, “So when you said your tribe has healers, you meant yourself.”\n\nShe gives a warm smile. “Something like that. The Raven’s wing of protection extends to His devoted.”\n\n“Any other secrets I should know about?”\n\nThe smile maintains. “Not at this moment.”\n\nGreat.\n\nYou remember what you should have asked earlier. “What’s your name?”\n\n“E’ffy.” When she pronounces it, it sounds like ay-fee.\n\n“Pleasure to meet you,” you say, offering out a hand, using your best Alteran manners. She stares at your hand, unsure of what to do with it. Next to you, Redding offers a chuckle, but no helpful input. After looking at your hand a few seconds longer, E’ffy slaps your open palm with hers, which only encourages Redding.\n\n“Close enough,” you utter.\n\n(Typical outsider. Not everyone holds to the same customs, you know.)\nTypical voice. Doesn’t help, but still gives criticism.\n\nSuddenly your mind is rushed with images of a Blackbird greeting. It’s like you’re watching a moving picture of yourself completing the gesture. Two fingers tapped against the throat, followed by outstretching the hand, palm open towards the sky. You attempt to mirror the motion with your physical body. E’ffy’s eyes grow wide, the small moment of surprise before recognition appears. She returns the gesture, running the tips of her fingers across your open palm.\n\n“Unfurl your black wings and wait...” you start\n\n“...Let the wind carry you home,” E’ffy finishes the greeting, a phrase that strikes you as a farewell too, another insight from the voice. “So it has begun already.”\n\n“What has?” you ask.\n\n“The bonding of Amir’sshan. He has chosen an outsider. This has never happened before. He has chosen you as his bondsman.”\n\n“You mean the artifact?” you say, drawing the dagger for a closer look.\n\n“I mean the god trapped within a mithril prison,” E’ffy corrects.\n\nIgnoring the god comment, although that’ll quickly be addressed next, you anwer. “The first bond to an ‘outsider’ shouldn’t be that hard to believe. We’ve only just discovered this World, after all.”\n\nBoth E’ffy and Redding give you the same look at the statement. “Should I tell him or do you want the honors?” Redding says. E’ffy points towards the former corporal giving him permission.\n\n“Kid, the New World may be new for you and I, but it’s not in the grand scheme of things.” E’ffy nods, understanding the position that you’re in.\n\nYou challenge Redding. “And I’m supposed to believe that you had knowledge of a New World all along, and you didn’t claim discovery or wealth in Alteran? The first explorers came back with trunks and trunks full of gold.”\n\n“A hoax,” Redding says. “Do you see gold lying around, waiting for you to snatch it up? I wasn’t the only one that learned of the New World\u0027s existence. Tell me, kid. You’ve had some level of formal education. Do you remember Jeremiah Reddish, famed explorer of Alteran?”\n\n“Vaguely,” you answer.\n\n“Then allow me to fill the gaps in memory.”\n\nFour years at sea he’s been. Not the entire time was spent on the Frontrunner, Reddish’s schooner and lady of the sea. No, the ship captain loves the boat more than--no, not more than Liza and the kids, although she might argue that’s the case. He loves the ship as well as anyone loves anything, a dog his bone, an artist his painting, a father….no, best not to go there. Finally, he’s home in Alteran. It wasn’t the welcome he was expecting. The ship captain had ventured where no one dared before. A New World! As dangerous as they come. Yet he survived with most of his crew. Half stayed back to build a new life for themselves. Reddish allowed them to. Rations back to Alteran would have been tight anyway. And he may be captain of a vessel, but he’s not captain of their lives. Each man steers his own life ship. Reddish would not take away from that.\n\nThe Frontrunner pulled into harbor mid-morning. The docks were bustling with cargo ships and many fishermen scrambling to find today’s catch. Reddish guided the schooner into the appointed place and dropped anchor. No fanfare. Not even a second glance besides the bookman, who immediately tracked Reddish down and charged an enormous amount for simple docking. A lot has changed in four years. They’ve forgotten me, Reddish thought to himself, a similar thought that echoed through the minds of his sailors. In their defense, four years is a long time, almost double of the time the expedition was supposed to take. Complications. There are always complications.\n\nMeandering through the streets of the capital city, Reddish took in the sights and smells. It’s dirty. Fucking dirty. The cobbled streets hold traces of horse-drawn carts, tracks left not by wheels. Too many people crowded so closely together, the smell from each spreading to the next. And the beggars. When did so many appear? They line the streets and alleys like birds on a tree branch, squawking for spare coin. After spending four years away from the Old World, suddenly civilization felt...wrong. Too many people packed together like...well, like how the Frontrunner’s cargo bay currently sits, not a sliver of space between goods. An abundance of wealth lies in the New World, not in gold or jewels, at least not in the sense most men seek. In the New World lies a treasure that is nonexistent in the Old World, a treasure that no amount of gold can purchase: a life of freedom. True freedom. That’s why half his crew stayed behind, the other half planning to return with their families, Reddish among them.\n\nThrough the winding streets, Reddish wanders until he’s finally reoriented himself with Alteran. It took a few hours and a few ales, but he’s arrived. He almost headed straight for the King’s castle. If he did, this story would have been cut prematurely, a limb severed from the body of possibility, world events changed forever, both New and Old. But something, perhaps guilt? (longing?) caused Reddish to detour his journey at the final moment. Instead of heading straight to the castle, always his first destination upon return, Reddish cuts down Crow’s Lane to a certain two-story house with a certain family inside. His.\n\nIt boasts a new coat of paint, a stone gray. Martha was always on his ass for a new coat. Seems she finally went through with it on her own. One door. Five windows. Reddish took a deep breath in preparation, still unwashed from his four-year expedition, still exhausted from the journey. But he’s home. Finally. Fucking, home. Reddish took the first step and then stopped. Someone moved inside the house, briefly passing by one of the five windows facing the street, a man, a man who looked perfectly in place in Reddish’s home. Did Martha move without telling me? The explorer wondered. And how would she tell him? He’d been unreachable by letter or pigeon. Then, a second movement. One that stopped Reddish’s heart within his chest. Martha.\n\nShe’s laughing. She’s dolled up nice. Are they going out? Her chestnut hair is curled, reaching just past her shoulder blades, covering the space of bare skin that her little black dress exposed. A flash of light drew Reddish’s eyes towards her hands and the rings that seemed to cover each one, all falling short of size and glimmer of the diamond around her purity finger, in the place where Redding’s own, smaller, diamond once rested. Replaced, both with the ring on her finger and in his very own home. Four years exploring the New World, finding all sorts of weird creatures and wildlife, fearing for his life during encounters with the natives, Blackbirds, journeying across the sea, unsure if food and water rations would see him to Alteran alive. Four years, and he never expected this.\n\nHe doesn’t know how long he stood there, outside, watching his (ex) wife rush back and forth getting ready. It must have been awhile--Reddish remembered how long Martha usually took to get ready. Felt like (four years) hours. But when the distinct sound of the doorknob clicked, HIS doorknob, Reddish, moved by instinct alone, quickly side-stepped behind a nearby lamppost. It’s unlit now. Cold. At dusk it would be lit by torch. The two of them, arm in arm, travel down the stone steps to their home and take off down the street in the other direction.\n\n“Mr. Reddish, sir?” a childlike voice, unsure of itself, rings softly behind the man hiding.\n\nReddish turned to find Gabriel, the neighbor boy who often played with his own son. That was years ago. Gabriel appears to be 11 or 12, the age his son would be by now.\n\n“Gabriel, you recognized me after all this time?” Reddish can hardly get the words out. Rather than met by his family, he’s met with the boy who played tag with his son, the boy who would discover mischief along with his own heir.\n\n“You are wearing the same coat, Mr. Reddish,” was the reply.\n\nThe mention caused Reddish to glance down. Sure as hell Gabriel’s right. It’s tattered. Frayed at the edges, and like his home was, the color was faded. He could afford a new one. Now that he’s returned with news of the New World, Reddish could afford 50 new coats if he wanted. But he doesn’t want to. He liked the one he wore. Money will never be an issue again in his life, he’s sure of that fact. But he’s on the outside, a man thought dead and cut from the lifeline of his family. He wouldn’t put them through his return. They seem at ease. Happy. Martha got her new coat of paint. All he would bring is pain to their lives. In four years Reddish became a man who gained the world, a New one at that, and somehow lost everything in the process.\n\n“How’s Jack doing, Gabriel? How’s my boy doin’?” Reddish uttered, managing to hold back emotion.\n\n“He’s good,” Gabriel answered, a typical response for someone of that age speaking to an adult. “I’m going there now. Want to come?”\n\nWant to come? See his son after four years. The answer is a whole-hearted yes, yes-fucking-please, yessir, lead the way! But that’s not what Reddish said. He couldn’t do that to Jack, who had a new father now, a new life. A boy needs a stable home. Reddish would only cause chaos, disruption to a life that boasts a sturdy foundation. Martha got her new coat of paint. Reddish had no doubt she got a lot more than that.\n\nI...can’t, Gabe,” Reddish whispered. “I have something for Jack, though. Would you give it to him?”\n\nGabriel nods.\n\n“Good. Come with me. We’ll be short, I promise.”\n\nGabriel nods again. Just around the corner. Yes! It’s still there. Macagans. The old tavern was a favorite of Reddish’s, unless Cliff changed the menu drastically. Knowing the old barkeep and owner, Reddish doubted it. As a regular, he couldn’t even persuade the man to serve water for free. Reddish told him it would keep patrons there longer to purchase other food and drink. The barkeep simply said, “If I pay for it, they pay for it.” Can’t argue with stubborn.\n\nIt’s not late enough for the usual night scene to arrive yet, which was fine with Reddish. Macagans was built from an old docking bay and warehouse. Two giant barn doors serve as the entrance, the inside large, open, and full of fresh air, something that a seasoned tavern patron can appreciate. Often establishments are too tight. High risk of bumping into another and spilling a drink. Like the New World he just arrived from, Macagans gives the freedom to move and sit where he pleased. In the reorienting process, Reddish was grateful for the former warehouse.\n\n“Is that Reddish or do my eyes deceive me? Damn those restless orbs if they do.” Cliff spotted him almost immediately, coming from behind the bar, same apron and by all appearances, the same tunic as he wore four years ago. Besides a little more around the gut, the barkeep looks largely (ha) the same, long sideburns, hairy forearms. “And is this your kid. Oh…”\n\nRealization seemed to fall upon Cliff. It’s as if he spilled a secret he wasn’t supposed to say. His face becomes like the explorer’s, reddish. “You know then,” Cliff spoke again.\n\nReddish ignored the statement. He didn’t want to think about that now, definitely did not want to talk about it either. The letter will be difficult enough to complete. “You still carry that dark ale, Cliff? The one with the frothy top?”\n\n“Aye,” Cliff answered.\n\n“Keep ‘em coming. Anytime you see my cup empty, replace it with another.” Glancing down at quiet Gabriel, Reddish added on. “And a candied apple for Gabe here.”\n\n“Aye. Sit anywhere you’d like. I’ll get the first round.”\n\nReddish picked a spot in the corner. Facing the bar, it presented an entire view of the tavern, back to the wall. Exactly how the man himself felt. A single table, two chairs. Reddish took one. Gabe the other. From within his coat (she got her fresh coat), Reddish pulled a parchment and quill. He might not be able to be in Jack’s life, but damn if he wasn’t going to leave him with something to remember his father by. His real father. Where to begin? How can a father pack all that needs to be said in a single letter? A tankard is placed on the table. That’ll help. That’s for damn sure. Reddish starts by getting the hardest part out of the way. Often the most difficult step is the first one. Then momentum builds, carrying. This was the path he’s been forced on. Like in the New World, Reddish sees fit to explore it.\n\n“Reddish...Redding, what’s the relation?” you ask.\n\n“My grandfather,” Redding answers. “My father, Jack Reddish--Redding changed it in early adolescence.”\n\n“Why?” you start to ask, but then lessons from your history book creep in. If you remember correctly, the explorer was executed for crimes against the king. Treason. “Were the charges justified?” Strange thing to ask, but it already left your lips. It’s like a friend disclosing an argument they had with a stranger and taking the stranger’s side. Luckily, your strange question is directed towards a strange man.\n\n“Some. Although there was some embellishment of course, as there are with any trial. Treason aside, my grandfather was silenced. He spoke the truth about this place.” Redding kicks the dirt beneath his boots for emphasis. “There were those from his crew that stayed behind. It’s a hard life, but a free one. Damn if those under the shackles of civilization don’t deserve the chance to break free.”\n\n“The first outsiders,” E’ffy comments. “They moved west. The tribes drove them from the coast.”\n\n“I was wondering about that,” Redding says. “No doubt the High King would have put them down if they stayed. By the time the military organized and settled here, it left too much time in thought for the crew. Too much freethinking time. The Old ways only work when each link in the chain is content to do their job without questions. Once they start asking them, however...then it threatens the entire structure of civilization.”\n\n“And yet they named Frontrunner’s Camp after Reddish’s vessel?” you ask.\n\n“And yet they did,” Redding utters.\n\n“That’s why you’re so hell-bent on changing the New World,” you add on. “The High King’s father wronged your family. It’s been revenge, slowly building until the opportune moment. Your father, Jack, could not accomplish it in his lifetime. Now the burden rests on your shoulders.”\n\n“I’m so hell-bent on changing the New World because it’s the right thing to do,” Redding retorts. “Or did you already forget the way Alteran citizens are treated. Links in the chain. Spokes in the wheel. Cattle under yoke.”\n\nYou’re tired of arguing with the man. It never accomplishes anything, and you’re certainly not going to get anywhere debating the task that was passed down from his father’s father, not that you’re against it anyway. Secrets. There seem to be too many, even withheld from your closest allies, which in this case is a single man, perhaps a Blackbird priestess in addition. I’m talking about the god trapped within a mithril prison. Secrets. Too many of them. One problem at a time.\n\n“Where does this leave us?” you wonder aloud.\n\n“I need your help,” E’ffy answers without a second thought.\n\nYou glance at Redding. He offers a shrug. “How can we help?” you ask.\n",
  "page 121": "You shake your head towards the woman. “I’m sorry. I need the aid of these men.” What you don’t mention is your skeptical feelings towards Blackbird medicine. Perhaps they’re capable of treating Redding by natural means, but you’re not willing to take the chance, not when you know several experienced field surgeons lie a few hundred feet in front of you, despite your circumstance.\n\n(Way to let her down easy.)\nShush.\n\n“Fine,” she says. “Unfurl your black wings and wait...”\n\n“...Let the wind carry you home,” you complete the farewell in her native tongue. (You’re welcome.) She looks surprised at first, just barely more than yourself. Then the smile appears, flashing quickly, before turning stoic again as if remembering something grim. She says a final thing before disappearing in the forest in a blur of tanned leather and black beautiful hair. You find yourself hoping there’ll be a third meeting. Only time will tell.\n\n“The Raven wills it. Amir’sshan will guide you.”\n\nAny thoughts of youth depart. You’re required to be a soldier. You harden your mind for the task at hand. Damn! If you had known the Alteran battalion would be here, you would have traveled through the hidden tunnel into the garrison dungeon. The artifact would be able to unlock any door along the way. It’s too risky now. Hours there, more hours back as stealth is slow going, and then more hours there. Nothing is ever easy.\n\nIf you’re being honest with yourself, there’s only one way to approach. Whatever deal is made between Alteran and Magda doesn’t negate the fact that there are wounded soldiers to attend to. Redding may be a distance away, but he falls into that category, just as long as it’s a Magda doc treating him and not an Alteran. As you know, turncoats aren’t well thought of.\n\nYou step out from the treeline into the open clearing. Almost instantly you’re flagged down by two Alteran soldiers wearing navy blues. They rush over to you, swords in hand.\n\n“Stop! Hands up” one of them shouts.\n\nYou instantly comply, throwing up two open palms. You don’t recognize the two Alterans, and they don’t seem to either. One of them, the same who spoke, grabs your shoulder rather forcefully and draws you toward the battalion like the way a mother would scold a son. The other pulls the longsword from your back. The artifact!\n\n(Please. I’ve been disguising myself from mortals long before your precious High King was even a high babe. Look to your arm.)\n\nYour inner arm, close to your wrist, displays a black marking. The tattoo is similar to the ones the Blackbird woman possesses, a crown-like band wrapping around the entire limb.\n\nNot bad. Little suspicious for a random tattoo to appear, wouldn’t you think?\n\nTingling runs through your arm. It’s as if a blade of grass were blowing against your skin in the wind. As you look down, the tattoo is gone. Instead a small dark ring, ravenblack, encompasses your pointer finger.\n\nBetter. Just as long as there aren’t any jewelry thieves around.\n(You better hope not. They’d find it easier to take the finger than pry me from my perch.)\nGreat.\n\nYou give the equivalent of a mental groan.\n\n“Sergeant. We found him wandering the outskirts.” As expected, the two soldiers bring you to their commanding officer. The High King loves his chain of command, after all. You already know how this story goes. The sergeant will pass you to his superior, who will do the exact same thing until a certain rank is reached, one that has actual decision-making authority. Until then, it’s puff, puff, pass.\n\n“Put him with the others,” comes the grizzled voice of the sergeant. Interesting. His superiors must be busy with more important things. Well, there’s a first for everything. Wait. The others? The two soldiers, your escorts, take you past the rows of Alteran soldiers, neatly arranged in formation. There doesn’t appear to be any signs of battle, save for the one with the Blackbird war party. The garrison must have surrendered upon seeing the Alterans approaching. Their fort couldn’t stand otherwise.\n\nThey lead you into the garrison through the hole in the gate. Inside the fort for the second time, things look very different. To be more accurate, it looks as if it were set on flame. Many of the square buildings display blackened burn marks, some burned down completely, large piles of ash. All the fires appear to be put out now, save for the one near the eastern wall, using logs built from fallen bodies, sending the scent of charred skin and hair into the air. Up on the ramparts, you spot Captain Briggs and Alexander. A table’s been brought out, and they occupy opposite sides. The captains sip small cups of tea from the spotless white table cloth, the tiny clinking of tea cups sounding out of place for the chaos before you. Rules of war. The surrendering party must host their conqueror.\n\n(Time’s running out.)\nYou think I don\u0027t know that?\n\nTo the western wall you finally see where your escorts are taking you. A few hundred, if you had to guess, Magda soldiers are grouped there, some seated on the dirt, others leaning against the wall. They’re nothing like the well-armored soldiers that fought previously. Most don’t wear their steel breastplates--actually, none of them do. Terms of surrender. Like you, their weapons have been taken, although none of them likely have an ancient artifact at their disposal. The Alterans don’t take your leather armor from you, so the removal of the steel breastplates must be a slight at the Supreme Leader, exposing the Magdan’s hearts vulnerable. A shove, and you’re just another conquered soldier in the crowd.\n\nIt’s a shame they didn’t throw you in the dungeon. Then there would be a direct tunnel to Redding, and no locked door would stand in your way. Damn! Instead you’re in the open for all to see. True, you’re not locked up, but constant surveillance dampens your attempts far greater than any prison cell could. Already, you’re scanning the fort for areas of escape. You’ve already noted the dungeon. Perhaps you could cause some commotion to get you and another locked up...a field surgeon perhaps. Though it would need to be the right amount of disruption. Nothing too excessive, otherwise you risk the noose.\n\n“Still making friends, I see.”\n\nBefore you can respond, a punch lands in your gut. Instinctively, you retreat a few steps in the case of follow up blows. Safely away, your eyes find your attacker. Benjamin, sharp features, thin nose and chin. Without his steel breastplate and buckler, you see his body type matches his features.\n\n“I seem to remember you already paid me back,” you say.\n\n“I did,” Benjamin says with a smile. “That one was because I wanted to.”\n\n“Oftly good spirits for a soldier who just surrendered his fort.”\n\nThe smile disappears instantly, like sandy footprints washed away with the tide. “And who’s the blame for that? Interesting coincidence that not shortly after you ‘defect,’ the Alterans show up in full force. I wonder who led them here.”\n\n“Oh please,” you start. “That’s right. And after leading the Alterans to victory they took my sword and rewarded me with your company.”\n\n“That’s because you can’t be trusted. You and that Redding. Where is he, by the way, deciding which army to betray next?”\n\n“He’s…” you trail off, realizing that you’re getting sidetracked with the bickering. “What are they planning to do with us?”\n\n“Us? We’re probably going to be sent back to Magda under the terms of never setting foot on the ‘High King’s New World’ ever again. Rules of war, you know. The Supreme Leader will be furious, but I suppose, technically, no bloodshed actually took place, breaking the peace. You?” Benjamin motions a finger across his throat.\n\n“Great,” you utter. You silently wonder how difficult it would be to kidnap a field surgeon in front of two armies, that is if none will accompany you freely. If they are marching you through the forest, it’s not a bad idea. The more seconds that go by, the more you’re starting to think none will go freely. And why would they? Their life is currently not at risk. Rather than tromping through the overgrowth to save a turncoat’s life, they get to go home. An Alteran surgeon could fix Redding up, but you have doubts on how convincing you’ll be. They believe you betrayed them, after all. People tend not to listen to defectors, not that it’s your fault your coat turned colors. Unfortunate, indeed.\n",
  "page 120": "Smug bastard. I swear I’ll repay him sevenfold for this. Instead, joyous laughter erupts from Captain Alexander’s mouth upon the finishing of his counterpart’s tale. Alexander brings his cup of tea to his lips to drink, but more importantly, to hide his true feelings on the matter. The cup, already small, looks child’s size in his hands. He’s not the most chiseled of men, but the soldier of Magda boasts shoulders little boys attribute to war heroes. That’s what I am, am I not?\n\nNot in this case.\n\nFirst the Blackbirds, then the damn Alterans. Rules of war dictate he must host the conquering party. It’s not the first time in Alexander’s career. His win percentage is damn commendable; it’s what thrust him to command in the first place. Here, however, here in the New World the Supreme Leader was counting on him. And he failed. It’s not the defeat that shames him. Losing battles are part of war. It’s the manner in which he lost.\n\nFirst the Blackbirds, then the damn Alterans.\n\nNatives. Savages. Against a fort. No siege weapons. No ranged weapons, save for a few tossed spears. And somehow they manage to punch a hole through his goddam gate. They poured in like fire ants from a hill. Magic, Alexander surmises. It had to be magic.\n\nAnd don’t even get him started on the Alterans. The man sitting in front of him, telling a story of invading one of the lesser-known republics of the Old World--with apparent embellishment--would be labeled a war hero. No, he doesn’t possess the sheer size of Alexander, he doesn’t look like a hero, but still, his name will be written in the history books for eternity. Captain Briggs the Conqueror. Sent Alexander and his army home, tail tucked between their legs without losing a single soldier. Likely, the same embellishment would apply, Briggs himself single handedly defeating twenty men or some bullshit like that.\n\n“Such savages they are. Crude weapons, pagan religion. They bring dishonor to a civilized man’s war, wouldn’t you say, Captain?”\n\nAlexander is brought from his thoughts. “I would say so, indeed, (smug bastard) Captain. Shameful.”\n\nWorse yet, his secret weapon, the very man who was supposed to turn the tide is missing in the forest. Most of his men believe Redding and his...pupil? Understudy? Sidekick? were the reason for the Alterans sudden appearance. Alexander isn’t so sure that’s the case. It’s just unfortunate timing. Redding’s always been a loose cannon, but Alexander believes him not to be the double, well, triple-crossing type. The former corporal has always done his own thing. Defecting back to the Alterans isn’t in his best interests, is it?\n\nLikely not. But Alexander will take the fall for trusting an Alteran.\n\nRedding and that damn artifact. He was obsessed with it before either man departed for the New World.\n\nAt a roadside inn near the border, Alexander waits patiently for his contact. Dressed in simple traveler’s garb, he looks nothing like the polished soldier he is, except for his stern demeanor and perfect posture. That’s not an attribute of a simple traveler. If anything, travelers are hunched forward, having a constant ache in the back, the burden of the road.\n\nThe door swings open, sending in a rush of cool night air. It’s refreshing after sitting by the hearth for so long, the ale warming his cheeks in accompaniment. A man with a scraggly beard, not a single gray hair with similar traveler’s garb, enters. Most men finding an inn during the night have a stressed look about them, results of the journey. Not this man. A constant grin sits at his face. He takes a seat across from Alexander, but first takes the cup that the big man is sipping at and takes several gulps, some of the contents spilling onto his face.\n\n“No, no, please. By all means,” Alexander comments.\n\n“A kind offer, to say the least,” the man says, a bit of ale dripping from his beard. The innkeeper approaches, a port-bellied man in a brown apron, the sleeves of his tunic rolled up to his elbows.\n\n“What’ll it be, newcomer?”\n\n“The roast for me and my friend. Don’t go easy on the seasoning. And two tankards of your house’s finest.”\n\nThe port-bellied man nods and returns back behind the bar, a kitchen beyond the bottles of spirits. Alexander eyes his contact. There’s something about the man that Alexander can’t put his finger on. An attribute that escapes his mind. Whether you put this man in the center of a harem or in the middle of a snowstorm, his demeanor would likely be the same, a kind of man that follows his own actions, despite present company and authority. A man who speaks the truth, unafraid of the consequences.\n\nStraight to business. Efficient, like a soldier in the Supreme Leader’s employ. “Redding, right? I received your letters. I’ve got to ask, why me? I’m just a lieutenant with limited influence.”\n\n“And do you always plan to be a lieutenant with limited influence?”\n\n“Fair enough. We could be hung for a meeting like this, you know.”\n\n“Yet you came anyway.”\n\n“Yet I came anyway. Now I’d like answers, sooner than later. The longer I stay, the greater the risk.”\n\nRedding leans forward in his chair, casually propping his leg on top of the other, far too casual for Alexander’s liking. He’s right: they could be hung for treason if a member of the Magda military found them together. It took many attempts to meet before Alexander finally agreed.\n\n“You have heard the rumors of the New World, have you not?”\n\n“You know I have. Everyone’s heard by now, including the innkeeper here. News like that doesn’t stay strictly within the military.”\n\nSeemingly at the mention of his name, the innkeeper places two tankards on the table. They land with a solid thud, spilling a few streaks of liquid down the sides. The man takes the now empty cup that Redding downed and leaves the two men back to whispering secrets of war. Every good innkeeper knows to give two strangers in the night plenty of space. Not because of manners, but because of denial of involvement.\n\nRedding takes his tankard and taps it against Alexander’s without a proper toast or warning. He takes a long sip, then speaks. “Our way of living will soon be obsolete. Alteran, Magda, the other republics and territories here--they all follow the same set of rules. It transcends borders. The laws written by the High King are written by the Supreme Leader. Tell me, Alexander. You enlisted as an infantryman and worked your way up to lieutenant. How many worthless rules and regulations have you blindly followed without question because it’s what you were told to do?”\n\nAlexander thinks back to his first few years in the infantry. Gods, he hated physical training in the “PT Uni.” Stiff breeches, a tucked tunic, complete with a sash at his waist and a thin, long sleeved jacket. A soldier always had to look proper, even when training to run for miles and performing pushups to failure, both of which could have been expanded with looser clothing standards. “A few come to mind,” is his reply.\n\nRedding nods. “It’s the same in my country. The rules of our societies won’t apply in the New World. There’s no question that our nations will be leading the expeditions. Whether Magda or Alteran leads in that regard, it means little to me. They have the same basic agenda. Subdue. Conquer. Force their way of living. We find ourselves at a crucial point in history. There must be a new set of rules or we will die in the ways of the Old.”\n\nAlexander sits back in his chair, crossing his arms in thought. He doesn’t touch the new tankard of ale placed in front of him. He’s starting to think Redding knew that he wouldn’t and ordered two for himself. “And who do you think will support this new way of life? No one will support your rule unless you take it by force.”\n\n“No, no. You misunderstand.” Another tankard down. “A lone ruler is how we got into this mess in the first place, a man too important to busy himself with the day-to-day, so he creates a position for another to handle that stuff. That man does the same, and so on. Monarchy is the way of beaucraticship, oddly enough. Tyranny is efficient, but unsustainable through eventual revolutions. Councils, republics, democracies--they’re plagued by the same inability to do anything meaningful. What I’m talking about is pure absolving of the system of government that we know.”\n\n“You’re talking about anarchy.”\n\n“I’m talking about freedom.”\n\n“You’re mad.”\n\n“Yet you’re here.”\n\nAlexander unfolds his arms and leans on the table. Suddenly the conversation feels too risky, even with a proprietor who is intentional about privacy. His voice lowers. “Is it even possible?”\n\nRedding matches his posture. “The New World is far from our leaders’ grasp. We’ll need to act fast before their hands grab a hold, before colonies can be established. I take it you’re in?”\n\n“I’ll hear you out. If I don’t like what I hear, I’m walking out that door never to speak again.”\n\n“Fair enough,” Redding says with his subtle grin. “Here’s what we must do…”\n",
  "page 6": "Turns out, cellars aren’t the most uncomfortable spot. Even more so, when your company happens to be a busty waitress. No, there are certainly worse send-offs to war. After you chivalrously helped Mirriam “move the ale barrel,” you celebrated by giving yourselves a generous pour. And another. Then another.\n\nYou lie in a pile of old straw, likely meant as softer packing for transporting barrels, hands supporting the back of your head. A lone candle burns on a table in the center of the room, giving off a low golden hue. It’s the perfect amount of darkness, where flaws go unnoticed, your mind filling in the gaps where features fall short. Or maybe that’s the many cups of ale. Either way, a goddess rests her head on your chest. Morning, and a clear head, will tell if she stands up to such a title. Likely not.\n\n“Tell me again how you pulled the corporal from the burning wagon,” Mirriam whispers.\n\n“I’ve already told you three times,” you answer, not as annoyed as your tone would imply. “It’s nearing dusk, only the very tip of the sun’s head is poking over the horizon. Arrows and bullets are whizzing past like angry hornets after taking a good stick to their nest. And there I see it. A burning husk of a transport, the pack animals gutted, but somehow still held by the reigns. I remember thinking, ‘there’s no way in hell anyone is alive in there,’ and sure enough, the corporal pokes a blood-soaked head out at the same exact moment. Now I’m...wait, did you hear that?”\n\nYour heroic story is paused for a moment at the sound of footsteps. They start slow, obviously attempting to be quiet, when they suddenly transition into full stomps, abandoning stealth for a quick assault.\n\nA figure emerges from behind an ale barrel, the very one you “moved,” knife in hand. He’s a young lad in desperate need of a good haircut and shave. His clothes are rags, and his knife looks like a simple kitchen tool, speaking to his position in society. He charges, knife raised high in the air. Mirriam screams in horror.\n\nIt lies comfortably on your navy uniform folded neatly next to you. The coat, folded in such a way that wrinkles would be absent once removed from its resting position. Always loaded, always ready to play. Your hand finds the familiar grip of your flintlock. Standard issue, double-barreled. As the hammer clicks back, time slows down, the small mechanism signaling approaching death.\n\nThe blast sends a sizable chunk of the man’s chest against the wall opposite of you. Before his body can react, your second shot lands center in the man’s forehead, snapping his neck back. His body falls with a solid thud. All’s silent now, wrongfully so. The sudden rush of sound amplifies the occurring silence, like there’s a gap in sound, life running normally but missing its audio.\n\nMirriam sobs in the corner. “That’s Kurd.”\n\n“Who?” you ask.\n\n“Kurd! One of the hired hands here. Me and him used to…”\n\n“I don’t want to hear it,” you cut her off, putting on your jacket and holstering the flintlock, not before reloading. It seems you’ve overstayed your welcome. The night’s been eventful enough, one to remember. Time to focus your mind and get some rest. The men might give you shit for sneaking into the barracks in the middle of the night, but it’s preferable to staying here. In a few hours you’re shipping off to the New World.\n",
  "page 5": "There are twelve of you total, including Corporal Redding. The High King is about order; he’s about structure. There is a clear chain of command in the army, and you best follow it. Often jumping rank, not reporting to your immediate superior, ends with blame on the one jumping, even if the subject of discussion is your immediate superior. It’s not a perfect system, but it’s a clean one. Neat and orderly, just the way the High King likes it.\n\n“And he shat his pants mid-swing!”\n\nWhile the High King values pristine order, his soldiers have a different emphasis. Staying alive for one, the gentle manners of a gentleman coming second, and second is being generous.\n\n“Bastus, I was there. I seem to remember you being the one with the loaded trousers,” another soldier chimes in. Lionel, perhaps the most proper of you all. His clean shaven head and face speaks to keeping military standards. You prefer to keep your hair long and a little scruff.\n\n“No, I don’t think that’s right,” Bastus ponders, placing a hand on his chin in thought. It disappears into the thicket of his foot-long beard. “Hard to say what really happened. If only we had eye-witnesses.”\n\n“I was there!”\n\n“Ok, ok, does it really matter who exactly wore the loaded trousers?”\n\nThis went on for another thirty minutes. Your mind began to wander early on. It’s a story you’ve heard before, one of Bastus’ favorites to tell at the ale table. Man does he like telling stories revolving around a fecal focal point.\n\nAs night slowly creeps in, you excuse yourself from the table in order to rest up for the morning. Your journey to the New World embarks in mere hours, and you’d rather not spend the first day nursing a hangover. You’ll save that for midway through when boredom settles in, one of the perks of enlisting in the army rather than the navy. The High King’s sailors will be hard at work; you just need to stay out of their way.\n\nCaught deep in thoughts of tomorrow, you almost don’t see them.\n\nTwo brigands brandishing large knives step into your path, abandoning their hiding place in the comforting shadows of a nearby alleyway. Their clothing is poor. Not even boasting simple leather as protection, the bare minimum. Booze reeks from their breath, likely the only reason enough courage is mustered to approach a soldier in the High King’s army. Even then, they seem a little hesitant.\n\n“Can I help you gentlemen?” your voice fills the silence of the night.\n\nThey glance at one another. “We’re a little down on our luck, good sir, and could aid in the form of coin,” one says.\n\n“Seems you have enough luck to afford a bottle,” you comment. “Surely, that doesn’t mean you’re too far down on luck.”\n\n“Fortunate we came across it,” the other one inputs. “What about tomorrow? What about--” As he speaks, he walks towards your flank. You cut him off mid-sentence. The distinct click from your flintlock echoes from your palm.\n\n“That’s far enough. Now I’m tired and a little drunk and I have to be up early tomorrow. I can’t speak for you, but I highly recommend finding easier prey. You see, I’m one of those soldiers who notch their kills.” Briefly you flash the grip of your pistol. “That’s only this year. The High King likes to ensure his soldiers have pristine equipment. You should see my issued flintlock from last year. The handle was a god damn puzzle piece by the end. Now I have no problem shooting you dead and continuing on my way. What will keep me up at night, is deciding whether or not your miserable bodies are deserving of being notched. I’m leaning towards no, but a kill is a kill.”\n\n“Just looking for a spare coin is all,” the first one answers. “You have a good night, good sir.”\n\n“You as well, gentlemen,” you say, allowing them to move out of your walking path. Perhaps when they’re sober tomorrow they’ll realize no soldier in their right mind would notch a flintlock. Perhaps they’ll realize the High King doesn’t refresh equipment every year. Perhaps they’ll realize you were lying through your teeth. Perhaps they knew you were lying just now, but they caught the one and only truthful statement from your little monologue: you have no problem shooting them dead and continuing on your way.\n",

  "page 2": "“I’d prefer to be on my own for now.”\n\nCorporal Redding sighs. “You always were more of a loner. I won’t force you to drink with the men, but you have to understand their viewpoint. Like it or not, a man’s trust is diminished if you’re unwilling to share a drink with him, even more so when it comes to soldiers.”\n\n“I understand,” you answer honestly. “You know me, Corporal. I’ve been with you almost four years now. I simply value the peace that accompanies solitude. Nothing personal, but I likely won’t have it for a while after tonight.”\n\nRedding places a hand on your shoulder. “That’s alright by me. If I were you, I would take care not to alienate yourself too much.”\n\nA waitress passing by flashes you a quick smile. It’s subtle, and yet it doesn’t escape Redding’s drunken notice.\n\n“Ha ha! That’s why you’re off playing the lone hero. Playing the part of a troubled soldier needing the tender hand of a woman’s comfort? Little suggestion for you, hero. Try more aimless staring in the distance rather than looking so interested in these posters here.”\n\nYou tap the side of your temple with one finger then point it at Corporal Redding. “And that’s why you’re in command of us.”\n\n“You lot have much to learn from me,” Redding answers with a smile.\n",

A few ale droplets from his beard take flight in the air. “Ha! Those would be your esteemed brothers-in-arms. If anything, they can distract the enemy long enough for you to find an opening.”\n\n“That’s not exactly a winning strategy. The High King will soon run out of meat shields.”\n\n“Careful with that,” Redding lowers his voice, sobering for a moment. “You shouldn’t say such things in cities like this one. “The High King’s superior weaponry and engineering vastly overshadow any of our shortcomings.”\n\n“It’s a road of ups and downs,” you say. Pondering a moment, you continue. “Actually it’s more like a circle. Wizards used to rule the battlefield. Then we invented the flintlock. Then breastplates were worn without a full suit of armor as people realized the majority of bullets were hitting the chest area. Since that’s the case, why weigh yourself down with steel greaves and gauntlets? But then these partially armored men found themselves severely underprotected against full armored knights, and guess what? More emphasis was put on training wizards, coming full circle.”\n\n“Makes you wonder what’s next,” Redding comments.\n\nYou sigh. “Probably something similar to what we’ve seen before, only to a much deadlier degree.”\n\n“Can’t say I disagree with you there. Come on and enjoy the company of the men. Who knows when we’ll get another chance.”\n\n“Is that an order?” you lightheartedly ask.\n\n“Damn right it is.”\n",

Behind Redding, one of your fellow soldiers emits a large belch followed shortly with deep laughter. “Ok, maybe you have a point.”\n\nA waitress passes by. Young thing, sweet thing. Noticing your near-empty cups, she stops. “Can I get you another?”\n\nRedding puts his arm around your shoulders.

The company, led by Corporal Redding, takes to the boardwalk and onto the galleon. They have you stand at the ship’s rails, along with the other companies aboard Devastator. Just in front of the docks lies a stage and podium. It wouldn’t be a proper send-off to war without a speech from the damn mayor.\n\nThe mayor takes position at the podium, dressed in a neat blue suit, his hair perfectly combed to the side. Next to him, a wizard casts a spell to magically project the mayor’s words over the crowd.\n\n“Good citizens of the High King! Greetings! (A cheer rises from the crowd). We have before us the finest men and women created by God, those possessing an unsurpassed bravery and call of duty. They have answered the call of their God and High King to bring our, yes all of our, glory to the New World. Unlimited wealth lies on the other side of the sea, a land so vast that it puts ours to shame. (Murmuring ensues.) Yes, really. It is imperative that each citizen does their part. After all, our enemies seek the same wealth. They seek to steal it from between our fingers. (Cries of anger). I know, I know!”\n\nThe mayor’s arms move up and down like a little bird flapping its wings, motioning to quiet down the crowd.\n\n“This battalion isn’t the first, and it won’t be the last! With each voyage sent across the sea, the High King’s claim is solidified even further in the New World.”\n\nThe mayor’s voice quiets down as if he’s speaking softly to a friend. He even leans on the podium with one elbow.\n\n“This time next week another fleet is departing for the New World, a place of promise with endless possibilities. Do your duty. Enlist. Secure your future now. The world is in a time unlike another other, a New one lies before us, untamed and unkempt. Do your part.”\n\nA bony finger from the mayor suddenly points at a single city watch member sitting at a table off to the side of the docks. Shining gold reflects sunlight, a perfectly fitted gold ring rests on the mayor’s finger, drawing even more attention to his outstretched finger.\n\n“Sign your name on the list. Be a part of the High King’s army. Bring glory to your country!”\n\nWith the mayor’s final word, the naval captains take that as their cue to set sail. Sailors follow orders barked from the helm, scurrying to untie rope and raise anchor. God damn there’s a lot of rope on a ship. As the fleet sails away, you can’t but notice the sheer look of horror on the face of the recruiter. A single man at a single table, hundreds of citizens rushing towards him. You can almost make out the faintest One at a time, please! The enlistees may be gathering like animals, but the High King’s army would sure as hell put some civility in ‘em.\n",
  "page 10": "The street leads directly to the harbor. Along the way, a little girl breaks from the citizen barriers and runs up to you. She hands you a small flower, a single stem with blooming white petals, then quickly runs back to her mother. Out of the corner of your eye, you see members of the city watch approaching the mother. They engage in an argument, and you know full-well who wins in the end. The path of the parade takes you away from them. As you set the flower into your coat pocket, you silently hope the repercussions wouldn’t be too great on the mother. Still, it’s the watch’s duty to preserve order.

  "page 98": "“I only know of one way,” you answer. “Cutting with the sword and firing with the sidearm. It’s clear that the S’umbra must be removed by physical means. Lucky for us, that’s what we’re best at doing.”\n\n“That’sa good kid!” Redding exclaims.\n\nBefore you can expound more, a loud knock rings through the temple, a dull thud echoing two times. Instantly, the doors to the inner sanctum swing open, which is not how you would expect someone to enter into a religious place….unless….unless the newcomer isn’t concerned about disrupting the holy place because they hold themselves to a different religion. E’ffy did say there weren’t many supporters for her sect of worship.\n\nA lone man enters, leaving his Blackbird escorts behind. The warriors stand guard just outside, which means either they’re more concerned with keeping people out than protecting their master. Which also means the man isn’t worried about the danger that stands before him now, the four of you. He’s dressed in purple robes, dark and tattered at the edges. His face remains hidden in a deep hood. The man removes it though, revealing Terr’ok, high priest of the S’umbra, acting chieftain of chieftains, enemy of E’ffy.\n\n“E’ffy, my girl,” he purrs, a voice that would soothe coming from someone else’s--anyone--else’s mouth. He’s not old for a priest, perhaps nearing forty, giving him ample years to hone his craft while still maintaining the vigor of youth, a dangerous foe indeed, likely in the prime of his lifetime, where both body and mind are still sharp. The man leans on a wooden staff, awaiting E’ffy’s reply. The very tip of the staff boasts a small carving of a raven.\n\n“Terr’ok,” E’ffy confirms his identity. Tare-ock. “Have you come here seeking salvation?”\n\n“I’m afraid, my dear, that has already been secured. Yours, however…” Terr’ok trails off. As he starts speaking again, a cry escapes your lips. It’s not of your own doing. Its compulsion is that of grabbing a smouldering coal and the instinct to drop it immediately.\n\n(EEEEEEEEE)\n\nTHe same compulsion brings you forward, artifact appearing in your hand as a blade. Black smoke. Thunderclouds. If the man is surprised by your actions, he doesn’t show it. Your companions seem more surprised by the sudden move, minus Redding, who joins your attack. A man of action, that Redding. Terr’ok remains in place with both hands on the wooden staff, you and Redding bearing down on him with weapons drawn. At the last possible moment, the high priest bursts into motion. The staff in his hands whirls as if a leaf in the wind; his footsteps carry him a perfect two steps backward. Not just a man of the cloth it would seem. Perhaps that’s the Blackbird way.\n\nTerr’ok’s steps take him just out of reach from yours and Redding’s blades, both swinging through empty air in the place where the man stood a second earlier. The voice thunders in your head, and like watching events play out in a dreamstate, you’re merely a spectator as the words of Amir’sshan pour through your own mouth.\n\n(REVENGE IS AT LAST MINE.)\n\n“The mad-god holds true to his name,” Terr’ok fires back, his hands returning to resting on the staff, a symbol of his strength originating from his deity.\n\nThe artifact seems to shut you out. You cannot move or talk of your own accord, trapped beneath your body’s new driver, the reins now firmly held by a being, possibly immortal--possibly mad. Perhaps both. By now the Blackbird escort rushes into the temple, drawn by the commotion. They’re protected by leather armor, each carrying an axe in either hand. You’ve grown used to looking up at the warriors; they stand a full head taller than the average Alteran, after all. The two newcomers are a different breed, however. They stand two--maybe two and a half--feet taller. Black paint covers their faces, the whites of their eyes and snarling teeth giving them a phantom-like demeanor.\n\nThey may tower above you, but they’ll fall just like the others. Amir’sshan changes shape within your palm. The black blade becomes the six-shooter, by far your preferred weapon and the artifact sure as hell knows it. Since you first felt the standard issue Alteran flintlock in your palm, you’ve felt comfortable with weapons powered by gunpowder, which is not something all soldiers of Alteran are drawn towards. Redding, for example, rarely fires a side piece, preferring the steady swing of a fixed blade. Just as the lich fell, just as countless others, you see your targets. The six-shooter raises. And you fire.\n\nTwo shots ring in the temple, a loud blast like a ship crashing onto the shore. One moment your targets stand in front of you. The next, your targets still stand in front of you. As if coins dropped into a collection pot, two lead bullets drop onto the temple floor, highlighting the sudden silence that followed your shots. The Blackbird warriors remain in front of you, unscatched. Smiling. Mocking.\n\n“Amir’sshan...the Veil,” E’ffy whispers.\n\nThat’s when you notice it, a transparent shield hanging like a cloud layer around Terr’ok and the warriors.\n\nTerr’ok offers a smirk. “You’ve been out of the mortal realm for too long. There are new powers, real powers that are beyond your shape shifting tricks.”\n\nWhite hot anger sparks within you. It comes from the artifact’s bond, yet you feel it as if it were your own. It’s the feeling of learning a family member was set upon by highwaymen, a righteous passion by association. The six-shooter won’t help you here. You’ll have to defeat the man by traditional means. Another cry escapes your lips. You charge with the black blade in hand, Redding by your side to accompany your strikes. The two of you have fought side-by-side many times. Even in your brief time spent in the New World it’s paid off, Redding countering after your defense, complimenting your movements with your own. Only, your movements aren’t your own; the artifact steers the ship, and Redding is unfamiliar with such an ally.\n\nYou stumble over each other’s steps, your now long, sweeping strikes with the blade--fueled by emotion--taking the place where precise, disciplined training once resided. The spirit of Amir’sshan drives you forward; the style itself would normally be effective. Truly, it would if you stood as tall as the Blackbirds, if the hand guiding the sword possessed the same ancestral body type. You’ve always been strong for an Alteran. You’ve always been quicker than most. The Blackbirds are different, however, physical specimens born to battle hand-to-hand, forged by the constant danger of the New World and uncivilization.\n\nAn axe catches Redding in nearly the same area that he suffered not days ago. You wonder if he’s completely healed or not, even if E’ffy’s healing magic closed up the wound. His body may not have the same strength as before, the byproduct of knocking on death’s door and finding no one home to answer. The man, the former corporal collapses to the floor after a stumble forward, both hands clutching his side, his sword falling from grasp. Suddenly the anger becomes your own, spurred on by the sight of watching, perhaps, your oldest friend fall to the natives.\n\n(EEEEEEEEE)\n\nYou charge, willing the longsword to extend into a two-handed greatsword. If the artifact is going to affect the way you battle, then damn if you won’t have a say in what form it decides to take. Besides, the heavy two-handed weapon is better for the large swings of Amir’sshan.\n\n(This body is weak. It cannot hold my power.)\nThen go somewhere else and leave me alone!\n\nIn the middle of the battle, you catch a brief glimpse of E’ffy. She and Onng have moved to the back of the temple, unwilling to take part in the fight.\n\nShe abandons us.\n(She doesn’t agree.)\nThis is who we choose to fight for?\n(Ahhh so we’re a ‘we’ now.)\nYes, as in WE would be better off if you controlled yourself.\n(Focus, hero. They--)\n\nThe voice is cut off. The same can be said for your right arm. One of the Blackbird’s axes found an opening in your defence, the axe blade cleanly severing your limb from the elbow down. Battle shock takes over. You feel nothing. It’s as if the sight of your severed arm at your feet isn’t registering in your mind. Oddly enough, all you can think of is the way a fish flops on the ground after it’s caught from the water, and you swear you see your arm twitch. The greatsword, only supported with one arm, seems to double in weight. Not that you have any faith in the outcome, the six-shooter appears in your left palm. If this is the end, you’re going to go down firing. The Blackbirds close in. Terr’ok smirks. E’ffy watches. You fire six shots. Their axes tear your body apart.\n",
  "page 13": "There is but one option for the threat before you: flag down the vessels and assess their intention, and if that intention turns out hostile, sink them to the bottom of the ocean. It’s a foolproof plan. Too bad you aren’t in control of the fleet. As luck would have it, the fleet admiral motions for the ships to pursue the sails. Perhaps you should have spent your time gambling with the others.\n\nThe expedition redirects their course, turning towards the two pairs of sails. Lady luck is truly on your side as the fleet is aided with the wind at its back. Each captain shouts orders to their crew from the helm, causing sailors to scramble into their position. Awful timing for you, downing a considerable amount of ale for how early it is, but there’s no going back now. In the case you find an opponent before you, better keep that in mind. Ale-induced confidence has been the downfall of many men.\n\nSoldiers aboard each ship strap on leather armor, meant for traveling, and form ranks, you among them. One by one, a designated man runs down the line, placing spears in the soldiers’ hands. It’s not your usual weapon, but it’s not unfamiliar either. Your longsword and flintlock rest comfortably in their position, should they be asked to play.\n\nThe sails draw closer. Downwind, the ships know they can’t escape the approaching fleet, so they patiently await your arrival. As you draw near, the color of their flag appears. It’s purple with three red stars in the corner: Fargrave’s colors. The fleet stops just outside hostile distance, but still keeps its cannons and spellcasters aimed at the two ships. We may not start a fight, but we’ll sure as hell finish one.\n\n“Hello, captain,” a voice rings out over the water from one of the two ships, pronouncing the word as cap-ee-tan.\n\n“Admiral,” Admiral Conway correctively answers. Conway is a woman with tight, pursed lips. Direct. Straight to the point. Captain Briggs stands next to the admiral. While technically being a captain, he’s an army captain with no vessel to his name.\n\n“Admiral,” the voice rings again (as add-meer-all). “Quite fortuitous timing you have. Stay your artillery a moment. I would have a word, one that doesn’t strain my voice or disturb sea life.”\n\nConway shouts back. “I will honor your parley. Remove all weapons and your overcoat. You may row a single transport boat over with one in accompaniment, also visibly unarmed.”\n\nAs Fargrave’s man bows, you see Conway whisper something to Captain Briggs. Whatever the man is told, you can tell he doesn’t like it. After a few shakes of his head, he finally nods, then starts to scan the fleet watching the two leaders. His eyes lock with Corporal Redding, who is standing to your right and apparently the only one in command not averting his eyes from Briggs’.\n\n“Fuck,” Redding utters. “Dust off your fine coats, gentlemen. We’re dining like civilized men tonight.”\n",
  "page 12": "It’s been weeks since departing from Alteran. During that time, your days have largely been the same: Wake up to yelling sailors, attempt to fall back asleep--to no avail, then visit the ship’s cook for stew and tea. After a few friendly exchanges, the cook switched your morning tea with morning ale. It pays to have friends in high places, or at least in charge of rations. Today is no different. After your morning routine, you find yourself sitting at the bow of the ship, dangling your legs over edge, sipping at your “tea.”\n\nFootsteps heavy on the deck cause you to turn around. Corporal Redding approaches, holding an entire pitcher of ale.\n\n“How’d you score that?” you ask, nodding towards the pitcher.\n\n“Command brings its benefits,” he replies, taking a seat next to you. After glancing in your cup, he tops it off. “Strange times we live in. A whole New World to discover. There could be others we’re missing as well.”\n\n“Could be,” you answer, taking a sip. “Or this could be the last undiscovered region of the earth. Who knows? One thing’s for certain, if another world is found, the High King will send us there, too, on his behalf.”\n\n“Some things never change,” Redding says with a laugh. “I’ve noticed you staring out over the sea of late. The other men busy themselves at the card table. Well, it’s just a storage barrel, but it does the trick.”\n\nSeems your absence has been noticed, again. As if anything goes unnoticed stuck on a ship with one another. Your gaze turns from Redding’s scraggly beard to the open waters before you. Sally III is sailing next to you, a schooner armed to the teeth meant to be the primary defence for the now-transport galleon you ride on. White foam crashes against its bow, spraying into the air like a child jumping into rain puddles. Blue water, far as the eye can see, surrounds you, painted with a fleet sent by the High King himself. This view is much preferred to your drunken colleagues, gambling what few possessions are theirs.\n\nBefore you can put the image before you into words, Redding speaks again. “I get it. You know, kid. Sometimes I think you’re too smart to be an enlisted soldier.”\n\n“I wouldn’t say that,” you answer. “I’d rather just spend what little luck I have on staying alive.”\n\n“Point proven,” Redding smiles, leaving you to your thoughts. You notice he also leaves the pitcher of ale. As you pour yourself another, a shout from the crow’s nest draws your attention.\n\n“Sails!”\n\nSure enough, two pairs of them are barely visible on the horizon. They’re a long way off, too far to tell which colors they fly. The High King isn’t the only one taking advantage of the New World. The seas surrounding it are breeding grounds for pirates, hence Sally III and similar ships of the fleet. The ships could be harmless. Or they could be scouts for a larger force. There’s also the possibility that Supreme Leader Fargrave (spit) is preying on the High King’s vessels, masquardering his men as pirates. The two rulers may be at odds, but no blood has been shed as far as you know. Who knows, the wealth of the New World may warrant such a thing. Funny how man’s search for wealth often paints a target on his own back.\n",
  "page 15": "The coat is your standard military issue, but the gloves are a little much in your opinion. What’s even more puzzling is the fact they packed white serving gloves on a voyage. Soldiers are an extension of the High King, so it’s your duty to portray his civilized and proper mannerisms out in the field. Too bad you don’t actually get to dine on the food in front of you.\n\nNo, instead, you and the rest of Corporal Redding’s soldiers get to play the role of servers tonight. A small dining table, though too large to be packed on a voyage (another opinion of yours), is placed in the center of Admiral Conway’s vessel, Yarden’s Lot. The galleon deck boasts more than enough space for the VIPs of the evening, which include the admiral, Captain Briggs, and Fargrave’s man.\n\nUnsurprising at this point, fine dining ware is placed upon a satin table cloth, complete with lids for each plate. Utensils are put on the left side of the plate, obviously, and dainty wine glasses shine brilliantly behind each plate. It’s standard practice between the High King and the Supreme Leader (spit) to present their best during a parley, often each side attempting to outdo the other in mannerisms and civility. The result is a fancy feast and your hands inside white, spotless gloves.\n\nAs you pour wine into one of the dainty glasses, Fagrave’s man meets your eyes. He is of dark skin, hair cut almost to a shiny bald, like the beard length of a mountain man who had a clean shave in the morning. He’s dressed in extravagant purple, frills lining the lapel and sleeves of his overcoat. A large hat rests on his knee, complete with a feather sticking out. What is that? Peacock? Apparently, “remove your overcoat” means “put on a fancier one.” You don’t see his accompanying ally. Perhaps he’s relegated to boat-watching duty.\n\n“Delightful,” the man comments. (Dee-lite-fool.)\n\n“Now,” Admiral Conways speaks through a set of pursed lips. “What are the terms of your surrender?”\n\nFargrave’s man laughs, placing his wine glass on the table. “Ha ha ha. You are mistaken, my dear. I’m not here to discuss any sort of surrender. I’m here to discuss partnership.”\n\n“There will be none. Discussion ended,” Captain Briggs inputs.\n\n“Wait just a moment, cap-ee-tan, and hear me out. Pirates. Brigands. Men of nefarious nature.”\n\n“Go on,” Conway directs.\n\n“They’ve been causing us trouble on the seas. They think far out here, away from civilized nations, they can prey on whomever. It’s in our best interests that they don’t think that. I know where they are operating out of, but firepower is currently lacking.”\n\n“He does make a fair point,” the admiral comments to Captain Briggs. “The New World needs to be established as a place of order. Lawlessness and piracy cannot be allowed to thrive. The High King knows this.”\n\n“As does Fargrave.”\n\n“If we were to aid you,” the admiral begins. “All repossessed wealth is claimed by the High King.”\n\n“If I were to accept your aid, the good High King can have half,” the man answers.\n\n“Unacceptable. The High King will have the entire cache.”\n\nThe man looks around. “And just where do you expect to store it? Your fleet appears to be transporting at capacity.” Dump a few dining tables and boxes of white gloves, and we’ll have room, you think to yourself. “Allow me to make a proposal. You need transport ships. I have two with plenty of room for cargo. We’ll serve as your transports for, say, thirty percent of the wealth. We’ll surrender all artillery of course, which will be returned upon landing.”\n\nAdmiral Conway sits back in her chair, pondering a moment. The man is right. She can’t hold much more cargo. There’s likely not even room to hold Fargrave’s cannons, although the fleet can hold some, dispersed among all the ships. Continuing to the New World will mean risking the pirates’ escape, allowing them to roam freely on the sea plundering as they see fit. No, she’ll have to address them now.\n\n“We are in agreement,” Admiral Conway says, offering a hand out.\n\nThe man shakes it. “Oh, and we’ll need muscle to move everything.”\n\nInwardly, you groan. Somehow, you know you will be volunteered, yet again, for the duty.\n",
  "page 9": "It may not be your first one of these, but damn if you won’t enjoy it. It’s not every day thousands upon thousands of people are cheering for you. As you march down the cobbled streets, you raise a hand and flash a smile towards the sea of faces. The result is a cheer from the crowd, their incessant cries raising in volume. That’s neat. You’re about to send them another wave when Corporal Redding stops you.\n\n“Enough of that, man.”\n\n“I’m just giving the people what they want,” you answer.\n\n“I wouldn’t draw too much attention to yourself.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nRedding marches in silence for a few seconds, then whispers back. “In the field, danger comes in the form of opposing colors. The city doesn’t afford such a luxury.”\n\nStrange. Corporal Redding is someone who typically enjoys the finer things in life, like a mug of ale and...well, sometimes that’s all you need. What’s got him spooked? Despite his tendency to drink, something that ails most soldiers, he’s always been good to you. If he doesn’t want you to react to the crowd, then you won’t. An order is an order, even those arriving in cryptic form.\n\nYou continue your march taking on a stoic demeanor. Citizens love that version as well, a soldier mulling over the gravity of his situation, possibly marching through the streets of his city for the final time, a life risked for the glory of the High King. Eyes. Yes, there are countless upon you, but you suddenly get the feeling of being watched, not from a cheering member of the crowd, but from someone with an ulterior motive for attending the parade.\n\nYour eyes quickly scan through the crowd, searching for danger. It may be nothing. It may just be all in your head, but as a soldier you’ve learned to trust your instincts. They’ve kept you alive so far, so might as well continue the streak. All you find are cheering citizens, nothing of the sinister nature you felt. It may be nothing. But you continue to stay alert just in case.\n",
  "page 14": "Not that you have any choice in the matter, but your destiny lies with the New World. Let the High King\u0027s navy take care of threats on the sea another time. As most of the fleet is designed for transporting soldiers, rather than geared for battle, it’s best to mind your own business. It seems Admiral Conway holds the same thoughts that you do. She orders the men to stay the course. Her orders are to drop the soldiers, you, at the New World outpost. Like every good military man—or woman—in the High King’s service, she follows orders.\n\nThe sails, realizing the fleet isn\u0027t approaching, stick on the horizon for a bit. Then they disappear from view. Truthfully, you\u0027re glad. You have no doubt there will be plenty of battles to fight in the New World, ones that are better fought sober and with solid land under your feet. As minimal as “minimal losses” are, it’s never zero. No matter how one-sided a skirmish may go, good men always die on the winning side.\n\nAs your services are not needed this day, you return focus back to the pitcher of ale. Kind of the corporal to leave it for you. The conditions don’t allow it to be kept in a cool cellar. As such, it’s lukewarm to the tongue. Lukewarm ale: better than no ale, barely. It has a slight citrus taste to it, unlike the full-bodied malty flavor you typically enjoy. The day is yours to enjoy. Soon, they will belong to another.\n\nYou lean against the side of the ship, careful to find a place that is out of the way from sailors. It’s not completely, there’s no place like that aboard a ship, but it’s damn close. Every so often a sailor will step within personal distance. For the most part, they’re respectful about it. You’re all in service to the High King, after all. Relaxed by the drink, the sun starting to shower its warm light across your face, you gently close your eyes. It\u0027s not quite sleep. But it’s not full wakefulness either. Somewhere in-between, your mind draws to the past…\n\n---\n\n“Father is angry with you again.”\n\nYou watch the scene unfold before you. It\u0027s your life, but you look from the outside, unable to control the actions of the child you once were. Oddly enough, when you were that child, actions still felt outside your control. A third party witness, you are familiar with the interaction between you and your sister. It’s an event that reappears often when your eyes are shut.\n\nYou, barely eleven, respond. “What did I do this time?”\n\nThough only a few years older, your sister is mature for her age. Smart, too. She easily sees through your feigned deception. “Really, now. Don’t play games. You’re bad at them. Master Gavin finished reviewing your test scores. You must be failing on purpose. No one scores that low. You got half of the questions wrong.”\n\n“Mathematics don\u0027t interest me,” your younger version answers.\n\n“Who cares?” Your sister throws her arms up in disgust. Her robes, displaying her class rank, dance in the air for a moment. Blue robe, three purple lines sewn at the shoulder. Blue for her class, purple, the highest, for her level, three lines signifying she’s at the top. “Your grades reflect on the entire family. You know Father is up for election this year. People won’t vote for him if they think his son is causing trouble.”\n\nUnderneath a plain gray robe, no stripes, you respond. “But I’m not.”\n\n“Anything less than near the top is causing trouble. You know Father’s rivals will spin this against him.”\n\n“If Father needs this much help getting elected, then maybe he doesn’t deserve to be councilman.\"\n\nHer face falls. “I’m going to pretend I didn\u0027t hear that...him, though, is another matter.”\n\nYou turn to find Vladimir, your father’s right hand man. Whatever Father needs, Vladimir gets done. In this case, a child needing discipline. His face is stern, unreacting to your insolent words. He simply offers a hand, motioning for you to follow him inside. You know where he is leading you. Vladimir, never Vlad, has his own room in the manor. On his wall hangs a certain club. You remember it well. Not more than two feet in length, marked with metal knots.\n\nFrom the outside, you watch the child take Vladimir’’s hand. They both know what awaits them; the child holds the same blank look. It’s not the first time, they both seem to think. And it won’t be the last. You try to scream. You try to warn the child, your younger self. It’s ineffective. The course is set, and there\u0027s no straying from it now. In reality, the destination was already reached. But still, you can’t help but warn the child.\n\nJust as always, you\u0027re unable to protect the child. The pair enter the manor, hand in hand. You’re left alone, phantom wounds appearing in your mind, the pain a very real memory.\n\n---\n\n“Wake-y, wake-y.”\n\nBastus stands over you. The large man, your fellow under Redding’s command, motions to the jug at your side. “We’re out.” He directs your gaze towards the card game happening across the deck. “Mind if we borrow some of yours?”\n\nYour mind briefly takes the view of your eleven year old self, standing beside your Father’s man, Vladimir, discipline about to ensue. You shake it off.\n\n“Still at it with the cards?” you ask.\n\nBastus shrugs. “What else is there to do?”\n\nThe recent memory brings you to your next words. Gesturing to the jug, you respond, “This should be enough for a buy in.”\n\n“You would join the game?” Bastus asks, surprise clearly on his face.\n\nThe distraction will serve you well, something normally the ale is meant for. However, in this case, it’s not quite doing the trick. Where one sin fails, another takes its place. You nod. “I see a chair empty…and wages to take.”\n\nBastus laughs and offers a hand. His laugh is a hearty thing that carries on the galleon’s deck. “We\u0027ll see about that. You might be a little out of practice. Don’t worry, there are many lessons to learn.”\n",
  "page 17": "You’re presented with a choice, although it’s not really a choice at all. Either you follow this path, or you finish the game (of life) prematurely. No, it may be presented like a decision, but it’s sure as hell not one. You realize that you’re not done living. Then again, rarely does a man decide he’s done with life. Usually it’s the other way around, occasionally the subconscious takes over, guiding him down that path, slowly, taking years, but eventually landing there. No, this is a simple choice. You choose life, even if that one brands you as an outlaw, an enemy of the state, oathbreaker. Hopefully your fellow soldiers make the same choice. A fraction of them do.\n\nThree of you remain, Corporal--well, just Redding now, Bastus, and yourself.\n\n“Splendid!” Captain Lugo exclaims, taking on a tone much too cheery for someone who just ordered the deaths of nine men. “My man, Jerkins, will show you the ropes later. We have many aboard the ship.” Jerkins flashes you a signature toothy grin. Better get used to that. “Now there’s a small matter of proving your loyalty. Trust goes both ways. I’ve shown that I keep my word; you’re still breathing after all. Now it’s your turn. Unfortunately, this man must die.”\n\n“Don’t listen to this pirate!” Porter, Fargrave\u0027s real man, pleads. “If you do this, you will thrust the New World into a war zone. Gods, the Old World will become a war zone. For what? To secure wealth? Your selfishness and greed will thrust both worlds into chaos.”\n\nThe three of you eye one another, the weight of the man’s words hanging heavy in the air. Your actions could have a much bigger impact than the current moment. Still, nothing’s changed since choosing sides. It may be a life originating from greed, but it’s life nonetheless. Better than death, at least to you personally. In the grand scheme of things it may not be…\n\nA flash of light. Gunpowder burns your nose. Smoke rises from the barrel of your flintlock. The man looks down at his chest, surprise clearly shown on his face, before collapsing to the floor. The decision was already made, Porter’s fate sealed simultaneously. You gain the ability to keep on living, but time will tell if the world is better off for it. Then again, you’re only responsible for yourself; the world has managed just fine on its own, and it will continue to do so.\n\n“Looks like we have quite the eager recruit, don’t we, Jerkins?” Captain Lugo comments, lightheartedly. Jerkins nods his agreement with a grin at his lips. “Now, grab that chest and let’s be off. Don’t want the Alterans to pick up on our little ruse.”\n\nWith Lugo’s direction, his men make for the chest the captain alluded to earlier. Wanting to keep yourselves busy or at least appear busy—something you picked up in the High King’s army—you gather nearby trinkets and valuables, stuffing them into a canvas bag. Your fellow recruits do the same. As you busy yourself, your eyes catch sight of the beach. Several pillars of flame rise where the crude structures once existed. The High King’s soldiers slaughter their leader’s biggest rivals. Should the tale reach it back to Fargrave, there will be repercussions. Silently, you hope they all die. The world, both the New and Old, are better that way.\n\nYou return back the way you came. Briggs and Conway are busy with the skirmish and don’t pay attention to the line of “Fargrave’s” men transporting plundered goods. That’s the plan, after all. Their ships can transport the wealth, the agreed sum going for the honor of the High King. No one says anything until you load the cargo back onto the ship, a few words offered, directing you where to place the wealth. Then, a statement that’s usually followed by a pull of a trigger, a swing of the sword.\n\n“Any last words?”\n\nIn your case, it’s the pull of a trigger. You don’t even see who fired the bullet. Damn pirates.\n",
  "page 16": "The agreement made, the two men are sent back to their ships. Soon after, you see their cannons being retracted from trained positions. Fargrave’s man is holding up his part of the deal. First, the schooners and brigatines, the ones carrying heavy artillery, navigate to surround the two ships, putting their full broadside facing the two ships as if to say, one wrong step, and ka-boom.\n\nThe galleons pull up, placing boardwalks between the vessels for transporting cargo. There’s only room for less than half of them, which is more than enough to put Fargrave’s men at a serious disadvantage. Outgunned, outmanned, any sort of betrayal would mean their end.\n\nAs part of the “muscle,” Corporal Redding’s team is assigned to travel with Fargrave’s men.\n\n“Now that we are comrades,” Fargrave’s man says, “you can call me by name. Captain Lugo, at your service.” Lugo finishes with a deep bow. “That’s Jerkins over there,” Lugo adds, pointing at the man who accompanied him earlier, though remained from sight. Noticing your attention, Jerkins stops, flashing a gap-toothed grin, and turns to wave, much to the dismay of the others attempting to transport a cannon to Admiral Conway’s galleon.\n\nLugo fills you in on the details. “The pirates are holed up in a cove half a day’s journey from here. We’ll be able to land at night and sneak up on the bastards. I’m sure your leaders want the glory for themselves, so we’ll act as the reserves, supporting as necessary. Once the way is clear, we’ll get to work transporting the goods, good?”\n\n“Good,” Corporal Redding answers on your behalf.\n\n“Good,” Lugo finishes. A little bit aways, Jerkins flashes you another smile. Great.\n\n---\n\n“There are many smaller islands such as this,” Lugo explains as you row silently in the night. Moonlight glints off the water, reflecting the stars sparkling in the night sky above. “Unnamed, mostly uncharted. Perfect place for holing up pirates.”\n\nThe sea is filled with boats transporting soldiers to the cove. The main fleet is anchored on the opposite side so as to not alert the pirates to your presence. At a moment’s notice, they could be called upon to rain cannonfire down on the place. For now, however, Admiral Conway is content to use Captain Briggs’ men.\n\nSure enough, several ships are moored on the island’s inlit. The light from the moon barely allows you to see a small beach behind the ships, and behind that, is a series of primitive structures, likely in place before the pirates settled here. Built by who is up for speculation.\n\n“They fly under our colors,” Lugo adds on. “Damn scoundrels. They don’t deserve to wear Fargrave’s sigil.”\n\n“Supreme Leader Fargrave,” Corporal Redding corrects, rowing next to you. Notably, he doesn\u0027t spit.\n\n“Yes, of course,” Lugo answers.\n\nThe first line of rowboats land. Soldiers exit with deliberate attempts to keep from splashing water. Once two or three men exit, they drag the rest of the boat to the sand so the others have a quieter place to step off. Your rowboat does the same. The beach, now littered with the High King’s men, ready to enact justice on lawless thieves, feels foreign on your feet. You realize it’s the first time in weeks that you’ve been on “solid” ground, and it will take some time to adjust--time that you don’t have. A few awkward movements from your fellow soldiers alerts you that they are experiencing the same thing.\n\nThe primitive structures are built in a series of ramps and huts. A few fires shine from within windows, not many on the open ground itself. As you draw closer, you realize the huts have a central tube that runs through all levels, a community chimney of sorts. Perhaps it’s not so primitive after all.\n\n“How do you handle an infestation problem?” Lugo asks.\n\nThe answer comes in the form of a bottle and oil-soaked rag. Lugo takes a heavy swig from the bottle’s contents, stuffs the rag down the opening, and flicks a match. Lugo chucks the bottle into the nearest hut. An explosion, rivaling that of a fire mage, erupts, filling the dark night with a sudden burst of light, like exiting a cave into the noonday sun.\n\nImmediately, those in your company follow Lugo’s direction. Apparently, acting as “reserves” means starting the skirmish with a bomb. Men’s shouts fill the once-silent night air as the pirates scramble to muster a defense. The High King’s soldiers surround the burning structures, cutting down men who seek to escape the fire within.\n\n“These folks have a firm grip on things,” Lugo observes. “Might as well get started on loading the boats.”\n\nRedding looks like he wants to protest, but then realizes, or perhaps, thinks about loading cargo deep into the morning. Better to get it done now. The pirates rushing from the burning structures don’t even bother donning their false armor showing the sigil of the Supreme Leader. Corporal Redding nods, and those under his command follow the lead of Captain Lugo.\n\nLike any good pirate, the wealth is hidden far away. In this case, it lies in the furthest structure on the highest level. Burying it deep in the sand underneath an X is too much work for a temporary location, which is what you take the cove to be, a short-term hideout until a buyer can be found. Lugging around wealth is asking for it to be stolen. Probably how the pirates came into possession of it in the first place. Along the way, you’re met with haphazard resistance; some pirates are more concerned with surviving the fire, while others find a deep sense of honor within themselves and attempt to stop you. Either way, led by honor or survival, you cut them down, casually shooting a few with your flintlock.\n\nAfter traversing a winding ramp, wrapped to one structure like an overgrown vine, you arrive at the top level. A single platform lies at the top, a canopy above it for shade and protection against the occasional rain, leaving the sides open, a potentially lethal fall from this distance. Broken legs for sure.\n\n“Lugo, you mad dog,” a grizzled voice greets you. Its origin is an older man, wrinkles displayed on his face like war medals. Hardened by years of combat. Like the others, he’s not wearing armor, save for his weapons belt tied around his waist. “How the hell did you convince the High King’s men to aid you. This is an act of open war between states.”\n\nCurious. He speaks as if…\n\n“It’s been too long, Porter. Wasn’t hard, really,” Lugo answers. “I simply explained it’s better for all parties if you are, let’s say, unencumbered by that treasure chest of yours.”\n\nThere are several behind the man along with trinkets and artifacts infused with precious gems. Strange…Lugo speaks like there is a singular chest he means to take, one that is the cause for the entire raid.\n\n“Fools. Do you know what you have done? There is peace between our nations only because the New World expeditions are treated as if a competition, not open warfare. You have upset the balance finely keeping the generals at home, while explorers lead missions. All that is gone now, thanks to your little agreement with this pirate.\n\nPirate. Captain Lugo. Suddenly, it all makes sense. The fleet was so concerned with their rivalry with Supreme Leader Fargrave (may you spit), they didn’t question the story fed to them. Law. Order. Competition. Conway attributed the ways of the Old World to the New. That’s the problem with tradition: it makes the mind stagnant, somehow creating universality where the relative needs precedent.\n\n“Shame. You’ve learned my dirty little secret,” Lugo says to Redding and the company. At once, those under command of Lugo act from their strategically placed positions, pressing you and the High King’s men to your knees, blades and flintlocks placed threateningly against the back of your necks.\n\n“Now I will spare you the usual compelling speech as we’re pressed for time. I’ll just read you the main parts.” Lugo searches within his coat pockets, humming, as if he were looking for his last match to light a smoke. “Ah, here we are,” he says, finding a crumpled piece of paper. “Wealth. Equality. Freedom.”\n\nHe couldn’t have memorized that? Still, the choice presented is blindingly obvious. Join his crew or die.\n",
  "page 91": "Light appears in the distance, a long-lost ally that has been absent for some time, other than the glow at E’ffy’s palms, that is. It’s a shade that’s burned into your memory. A dark purple, almost black glow. Ravenlight. It brings structure to the darkness. Contrast. Now, you can see what lies ahead, at least more than a few around E’ffy. The tunnel gradually becomes less narrow, opening up into a wide section that could fit an entire Alteran company side-by-side in your estimate. Dark green vines, mostly unrecognizable, grow on the walls. Seems even within the caves of the New World things are growing. The ravenlight grows in luminosity. Dark figures appear in front of you. Blackbird warriors.\n\nEach wears an axe on both hips. Each stands a full head taller than you.\n\n“Have you captured these tek’usans all on your own, priestess?” one says. He speaks in the articulate tone that you’ve come to expect from the natives.\n\n“No. They are free,” E’ffy says. “He is the bondsman. Amir’sshan has chosen.”\n\nYou know a cue when you see one. You pull the artifact into view, spiraling the dagger around the palm of your hand a few times. Unlike most daggers, it doesn’t flash with being brought into light, ravenlight or natural. Rather, it shines with true darkness, the cave around it simply an imposter darkness shying away from the black mithril.\n\n“Are...are you sure?” the other Blackbird speaks. You’re not used to such timidity from the natives. His tone reminds you of a child asking a parent to visit a friend’s home.\n\nYou didn’t miss the first cue and you sure as hell aren’t going to miss the second. Small thunderclouds. Black smoke, true black smoke, appears in the darkness of the cave. The artifact becomes a weapon that the blackbirds would recognize--well, that they would appreciate. The blade transforms into an axe head, keeping the same wing-tipped handle, although it grows in length to keep balance with the axe.\n\n(Looking for a round of applause, hero?)\n\n“E’ffy, Terr’ok is not going to like this.”\n\n“Or us letting you pass,” the other inputs.\n\n“Then take it up with my father,” E’ffy quickly answers. She seemed to have that one locked and loaded like an Alteran flintlock, standard issue. Double-barreled. It’s definitely not the first and probably won’t be the last time the priestess got her way by involving her father, whoever he may be. You can’t help but notice the threat was backed by tribal standing rather than religious. Although being a priestess, even for an older sect, she does not use that to get her way. Whoever her father may be holds more influence than her status as a priestess.\n\n“We hold no quarrel with Chieftain Malic’ant. Pass through, quickly. And do not mention our names.”\n\n“Thank you, brothers,” E’ffy says and waves you forward. Redding flashes a smile towards the pair of warriors as you pass. They don’t return the gesture. After passing by the initial scouts, you come across four more checkpoints, each one holding more Blackbird warriors than the last. The encounters are handled similarly, each one becoming more smooth than the last now that you know the questions asked and the answers to get waved through. The resemblance between the way the warriors act compared with the chain of command of Alteran is uncanny. In an entire New World, men know their places and aren’t willing to risk upsetting the CO, commanding officer, above them in rank. The High King loves his chain of command, sure; the Blackbirds appear to love it as well. And at the top, rules E’ffy, with her father, Chieftain Malic’ant’s name on the tip of her tongue.\n\nThe path opens up into a--cavern would be the wrong way to describe it, not that it wouldn’t be completely inaccurate. It’s essentially a large city, albeit underground. It’s a large a space that you’ve seen; the ceiling itself can’t even be witnessed. The top lies somewhere above where the abundance of ravenlight can’t even reach. It might be a few feet in the darkness. It might be five-hundred. Like the opposite of a deep body of water, the height of the ceiling is endless. Ravenlight is in abundance, but you see very few actual torches.\n\n“The plants,” E’ffy explains. “They blossom light.”\n\nSure enough, as you’re becoming accustomed to in the New World--even underground--plants are everywhere. Here, however, they are root-like vines that touch every building and structure, which themselves are built from stone blocks. The Alterans may consider the natives a primitive people compared to their own “civilized” culture, but there’s no denying the Blackbirds aren’t the stone hut simpletons that they’re made out to be...even though their houses may be stone huts. The huts themselves are circularly built, like a large version of a Magda buckler.\n\nThere are less of them than you imagined. The war party that attacked the garrison was large in number, yes, and it appears that they didn’t have any reserve soldiers. Which makes you wonder if the Blackbirds lack military strategy. Perhaps. They stand taller and physically stronger than the average Alteran. Put together, though, the formations of Alteran are an impenetrable shield, and on the offensive, a dagger piercing between links of armor. You see warriors helping with daily chores, a few watering domesticated animals, harvesting rows of planted food. Only in the New World could one farm underground.\n\n“This way. To the temple.”\n\nYou and Redding allow E’ffy to lead you to the temple. Everywhere you look, eyes are fixed upon you. It’s eerie in a sense. All attention is drawn towards you; it’s as if you’re walking through the hallways of the High King’s palace buck naked. Most hold confused stares, others look as if they want to draw their axes here and now. Under E’ffy’s protection, you guess that would be a big disobedience of their laws. Lucky you. You’re not sure what exactly you were expecting or how she planned to remove the S’umbra from the equation, but you didn’t imagine waltzing directly through the center of their war camp, which itself, doesn’t much keep to the “war” part of war camp.\n\nThe temple’s in the corner of the war camp, built against the wall of the “cavern” itself. Like the other buildings, it’s built from stone with round walls. There’s an outer layer. An outer and inner sanctum of sorts. You pass through the unguarded gate, not much more than an open doorway leading into a series of altars and mats lying on the floor. It bears resemblance to the halls of the dead, the mats are the same, even the altar looks like the one where you first discovered the ravenlight torch many days ago.\n\nThe inner sanctum is an empty room, built, unsurprisingly at this point, like the tomb where you battled the lich, although instead of a sarcophagus, a large stone altar lies in the center, the rest of the room arranged around it. It’s empty minus a frail-looking Blackbird dressed in a tattered brown robe. The man looks about your height, a runt for the natives. Rather than the long braided hair of the warriors you’ve faced--even E’ffy wears a single braid, the Blackbird has his black hair cut bowl-like, as if shaped like the huts of the war camp.\n\n(A few nails missing in the construction of this one, I think.)\nYou know, we might actually agree here for once.\n\n“My priestess! You can not allow these, these, these...outsiders to enter into such a holy place!”\n\n“Calm down, Onng. These are our guests,” E’ffy answers with a practiced patience that you’re sure she’s built up over a timespan spent with the man. His name is Onng. By the High King’s pristine chamber pot, even the man’s name is different from the other natives.\n\n“If the others learn of this…this, abomination! Then they will surely force us from serving the Raven.”\n\n“They will do no such thing,” E’ffy says with a casual demeanor, like that of swatting a buzzing fly.\n\nRedding strides up to Onng. No stranger to peculiarity, he offers a hand in greeting. “Onng, is it? You can call me Redding. And you can call him,” he points to you. “You can call him--”\n\n“I will call you outsiders, is what I will call you,” Ongg cuts him off before you can be properly introduced. He seems to take pride in his words as a great big ol’ smile appears at his mouth, highlighting a few gaps within his teeth.\n\n“You will call them guests and nothing more,” E’ffy says as if scolding a child for not getting into bed on time.\n\n“All right, ‘guests.’”\n\n“Thank you kindly,” Redding answers, taking a sweeping bow, a gesture that Onng tries to imitate.\n\nE’ffy laughs. “Onng has been serving the Raven since birth. His parents...are not with us.” What started out as a friendly statement quickly turned sour. “Make yourself comfortable. There is food and drink over there. (She points to another doorway at the end of the room.)\n\n“With respect,” you say. “I think I’d rather hear of your plan to defeat the false priests before settling in. I don’t think I could be ‘comfortable’ otherwise.”\n\n“You are WHAT?”\n\nE’ffy ignores the outburst from Onng. Probably something she’s used to doing. “Are you sure? It would be good to replenish your energy.”\n",
  "page 90": "A hand on your shoulder, a head resting on the other. You awake face-to-face with Redding, squatting to eye level. He holds up two fingers. Time’s up, sleepyhead. You nod and turn to the head resting on your shoulder. When you see her, it takes every instinct in your body not to startle, jump, run. E’ffy’s sound asleep, shifting in the night to use your shoulder as a makeshift pillow, body leaning on one hip the way a woman sits on a picnic blanket in order to save those downwind from an unsavory flash. You suppose it’s a natural position to sit, considering her traveling companions are two men.\n\nThen, Redding and you have the same thought. It’s the instinct that animals seem to have when an earthquake is near, the bones of an old grandmother alerting her to rain clouds on the horizon. Your vision collectively draws to the subtle place E’ffy’s hand has wandered. Whether by accident or not, it rests on the handle of the artifact. Worrisome, to say the least. Your bet is that it’s accidental, unintentional, whatever. After all, she didn’t--or at least it appears she didn’t--try to draw the weapon itself, the artifact currently asleep in its dagger (talons) form. Redding gives you a shrug, one that’s becoming just as patented as his constant smirk, as you gently slide from underneath the woman, lightly placing her hand from the artifact.\n\n(Concerned I’m cheating on you, hero?)\n\nIgnoring the jest, you think back, Do I need to keep an eye on this woman?\n(Have you ever not had eyes on her?)\nYou’re useless. I’m in no mood.\n(Well you certainly seem like you’re in some sort of mood.)\n\nThe voice’s demeanor reminds you of an older sibling being difficult on purpose. It seems to sense the thought...or hear it.\n\n(I would not concern yourself with the priestess. She’s but a wolf pup seeking to take on the pack.)\nThat’s exactly what her allies want to hear after throwing in their lot.\n\nRedding interrupts the dialogue, whispering, “If you’re going to have conversations in your head, do it while I sleep. I can only assume that’s what you’re doing since your mouth is moving in small patterns, but no words are coming out.”\n\nRight. It’s your shift. You decide to take Redding’s position on the other rock. Perhaps some separation between you and E’ffy will help your thoughts flow freely, even if they are altered by the voice. Taking a seat, you glance at the night sky. A cloud layer hangs over you, a steady, well, cloud of dark gray, glowing in the section nearest to the moon, who’s seemed to take a backstage position tonight. The voice, helpful as always, quiets down, allowing you to focus on your watch. Small animals cry out in the night, their howls, chirps, and oddly enough, clicks, unfamiliar to your ears. The night passes without any further interruption, at least not any that don’t occur every two hours on the dot.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning you awake famished. The events of the previous day took precedence over hunger. It’s a shame you don’t have any travel rations, not even a small amount of dried meat for a quick fix. You voice it to the others as they awaken. E’ffy takes the chance to volunteer to teach you which plants are safe and which are fine to eat from. WIthout equipment to pack up, there’s nothing else to do than follow her.\n\nSurprisingly, last night was warm. Warm enough to rest comfortably without blankets or a sleeping roll. The morning is a bit brisk, however, making you think exhaustion won the warm/cold battle the previous night. You doubt you’ll return back to the campsite, if you could call it that, and take one last look at the two giant stones guarding the cave’s entrance; the mouth of the cave itself sits dark and void. Will you join me in bringing about the Raven’s will?\n\nE’ffy leads you cheerfully down the path; there’s almost a skip in her step. You’d consider yourself a morning person. Being in the military forces you to be one, although you’ve never felt energy like E’ffy in the morning. You think you catch Redding rolling his eyes a few times, and confirm he’s never felt the same either. It’s the endless energy of a young child, yet unaffected by the weight of life and the tendency to lean on the bottle. E’ffy stops and plucks a few bright berries from a nearby bush.\n\n“Dark red is good. Bright red is bad,” she says, handing the berries out. You look down in your palm. The fruit she placed in your hand are red, yes, but different shades of which one could consider both dark and bright.\n\n“These ones are...ok?” you ask. Next to you, Redding pops the entire handful into his mouth, the way one would toss back a shot of vodka.\n\n“Dark is good. Bright is bad,” she repeats again.\n\nYou slowly raise your hand to your lips. E’ffy watches intently. At the last moment, she nods her approval, upon which you toss back your handful as well. Flavor bursts into your mouth. Juice squirts out from the berries like a puncture in the side of a ship. It’s sweet. Fresh. Like the inside of a pastry.\n\n“Not bad,” you comment.\n\n“Way to understate it, kid,” Redding says, plucking more berries from the bush. You take a few more for the road. Today you’ll arrive at the Blackbird war camp. They assembled an entire war party to march on the outsiders, tek’usans, who disturbed a sacred resting place. You’ve burned bridges with both superpowers from the Old World and can’t rely on their support. You doubt even Prinn, a childhood friend with whom you’ve survived much, would come to your aid. That is, if he even recognized you. You arrived in the New World with a thousand soldiers as your allies, traded them for the Magda garrison, and now you stand with a single Blackbird woman to count as an ally.\n\n(Don’t forget me!)\n\nAnd now you stand with a single Blackbird woman and a mouthy...voice as allies.\n\n(You’re too kind.)\nBe serious for a moment. Are we rushing to our doom?\n\nA pause.\n\n(I know not. In my current form, I’ve been passed from user to user. Spent centuries as a royal heirloom, given from father to son. There are only a small number that I’ve bonded with. Those who I bond with hold possession far longer than the others.)\nYeah, possessing a gun with endless bullets tends to preserve one’s life.\n(And this is what you heroes live for, is it not?)\nDon’t call me--\n(--your type lives for odds stacked against them, a lone man against an army, standing against the onslaught of enemies.)\nSounds romantic and all, but I\u0027d much rather have an army at my back.\n(Well, you don’t.)\nWell, I don’t.\n\nThe voice turns quiet, almost reflective. You draw closer to the Blackbird war camp. It’s not their traditional home, at least that’s what E’ffy makes it sound like. Rather, it’s a temporary dwelling to unify as a war party, ready to mobilize at a moment’s notice. It’s around midday, just past, when you arrive. This close to the war camp, you’re surprised that you haven’t run into any warriors. They must be watching though. There’s no way three people are allowed to wander this close without several eyes, and likely arrows, pointed in the direction.\n\nThe land itself bears the dense overgrowth that you’ve grown (ha) to expect from the New World. No stranger to military camps, the Blackbird’s presence is unexpected, or rather, their lack of presence. The numbers that you fought at the garrison were a significant amount. Holding that many members in one place should be telling in the environment around it, heavily marched trails, lessened wildlife noise, the occasional discarded item or smoke. Nothing here. Unless E’ffy was leading you here, you’d have no idea you’re able to stumble upon hundreds of Blackbird warriors.\n\nTwisting vines run across the path you take, mirroring tree roots that have rampantly grown underfoot, poking their heads up from underneath the ground. Then, a rush of water. It’s soft at first, barely heard through the trees. With each step it gets louder, a steady crsssh of white noise. The air itself becomes misty, like that of a morning dew. The jungle opens up to a clearing not much more than ten feet deep.\n\n“Gods above,” Redding blasphemes under his breath.\n\nDirectly across from the cliff’s edge, a large waterfall crashes down to a pool of water, the impact of the water creating white mist. The waterfall itself gracefully falls from a sheer cut of blackened rock, the color of rock that you’d imagine seeing next to a volcano. Jagged edges guide the waterfall, sharp edges that frame either side like armed guards escorting a prisoner of war. Surrounded by green, the blackrock waterfall is a deadly oasis in the New World forest, a clearing in the woods, the eye of the storm.\n\n“The camp is here?” you comment, eyes glued to the water like the way one stares into a fireplace and the flames that dance within.\n\n“You will see,” E’ffy answers with a smile. She steps to the cliff’s edge with both arms outstretched. “May the Raven protect us in flight.” She waves you and Redding to imitate her.\n\n“You’re--you’re not going to leap, are you?” you ask, glancing down. It must be at least a hundred feet straight down.\n\n“Are you coming or not?” E’ffy asks.\n\n“Ladies first,” you answer without a beat, arms similarly outstretched in flight position. Redding simply shakes his head, but also does the same.\n\n“Take a deep breath, close your eyes, and--”\n\nA hand at your back. And suddenly you’re falling, falling, falling...\n\n...and land on your back not two feet behind the cliff’s edge, pulled down by E’ffy’s grip at the back of your shirt. A dazed look shines on Redding’s face before the patented grin appears. It’s brief, but you catch it. You probably have the same look on your face minus the grin. E’ffy’s laugh fills the air, a womanly tone mixed with childlike glee.\n\n“It is a common trick we play on coming of age warriors. ‘In order to test your loyalty, jump.’”\n\n“Yeah, and did we pass the test?” Redding utters under his breath.\n\nE’ffy shrugs.\n\n“So how do we get to the camp then?” You try to get things back on track. For the mission that you’re on, you’re finding it strange that you need to. Chalk it up to words lost in translation or something like that. The clashing of cultures. Men and women...that one’s a bit more of a stretch.\n\n“I will show you,” E’ffy says, back to being serious. “The path leads down here.”\n\nOff in the distance, not nearly close to “here,” there’s a break in trees. The overgrowth parts just enough for several bodies to pass through side by side. It appears to be a natural break; there aren’t signs of Blackbirds chopping away at vines, branches, and bushes, not that you’d expect them to anyway. The natives are much in tune with the New World’s overgrowth, and even though you aren’t completely understanding of their religion and customs, you’re fairly certain taking an axe to the jungle for a simple walkway isn’t something they’re keen on doing.\n\nAs you pass through the break, the air itself feels different. Cooler. Fresher. The first breath is like that of walking in the night air after being tightly packed in an alehouse for hours, the difference between icy spring water and water that’s been left in your waterskin for days. Of course the war party would reside here. If you had a choice, you would too. The path leads downhill, twisting, spiraling. Overhead, tree branches hang across the path, meeting in the middle, touching those on the opposite sides creating a tunnel-like feel. It’s like you’re being led along the path. Sure, you could stop; you could turn around, but you don’t want to.\n\n“You feel it too,” E’ffy says. “The Raven’s embrace.”\n\n“I feel something, that’s for sure,” you comment back.\n\nSharp shadows grace the path downward, sunlight managing to pierce through the canopy and the tunnel ceiling in small specks at a time, like glittering diamonds, highlighting the darkness of the trees, their trunks and branches a deep brown, a solid foundation for the sea of green to grow upon. The three of you subconsciously step lightly so as not to disturb the peaceful aura that lives here, as if the sound of your boots on dirt will send the calming path into chaos. The creek was once peaceful too. Now it’s littered with the dead.\n\nThe path opens into a poolside clearing, a meadow of sorts. Tall grass, at least a variant of grass, stands between the path and the waterfall’s pool. Small flowers grow on the long blades of grass in various colors, red, yellow, and purple, the white crash of waterfall mist their backdrop, a blank canvas on which the meadow can paint its colors against. There’s a cool breeze, one that you weren’t expecting at the base of a waterfall. It’s light, comforting, unlike an annoying wind that can’t help but blow strands of hair out of place. E’ffy leads you through the meadow. The path is a direct path through, straight as an arrow. It leads to another part of the jungle, the overgrowth beginning against where the meadow rudely interrupted its flow. After a single bend, you see where she’s taking you.\n\nA cave sits dead ahead, its rock the same black as the waterfall falls from, the mouth of the cave itself far blacker, the kind of black that bears no contrast, no structure. SImply, black, an endless void absent of color. Your mind draws back to your dream. The cave. The sacrifice. The artifact stolen. A premonition, perhaps? Or the mind filling in gaps. Who’s to say dreams have real impact, actual influence on reality. The mind does at it pleases, often taking you along for the ride. In battle it’s the opposite way, however. The flow state takes over, putting the mind as a passenger along for the ride, instinct and training taking command.\n\n“You got a light, miss?” Redding breaks the silence.\n\n“In a way,” E’ffy answers. You’re starting to realize that she likes hiding things. Tricks, misdirection, they seem to excite her. It can’t be a Blackbird thing, not that you’ve actually spoken to any other native still living. There’s no way you can imagine the warriors you slew playing practical jokes, although it could be the setting of battle. Either way, you’re sure to find out soon. Hopefully their sense of humor isn’t executing two outsiders for disturbing a sacred burial place. It wouldn’t be the best of humor, but they’re damn sure to have the last laugh in that scenario. All the laughs, in fact, minus a chuckle or two from Redding, perhaps.\n\nE’ffy whispers under her breath, bringing her palms to her lips. It looks as if she’s whispering in the ear, sharing a well-kept secret to her hands. You’re unable to decipher what she’s saying. A second later, ravenlight emanates from her palms. She takes the lead, both hands turned towards the ceiling, sending the area around her in a dark purple glow, your bodies at least; the cave itself remains black, not even the ravenlight can soften the void.\n\nIt’s into the void E’ffy walks, you and Redding closely behind. Whatever hides in the shadows of the cave will soon be revealed.\n",
  "page 93": "Light appears in the distance, a long-lost ally that has been absent for some time, other than the glow at E’ffy’s palms, that is. It’s a shade that’s burned into your memory. A dark purple, almost black glow. Ravenlight. It brings structure to the darkness. Contrast. Now, you can see what lies ahead, at least more than a few around E’ffy. The tunnel gradually becomes less narrow, opening up into a wide section that could fit an entire Alteran company side-by-side in your estimate. Dark green vines, mostly unrecognizable, grow on the walls. Seems even within the caves of the New World things are growing. The ravenlight grows in luminosity. Dark figures appear in front of you. Blackbird warriors.\n\nEach wears an axe on both hips. Each stands a full head taller than you.\n\n“Have you captured these tek’usans all on your own, priestess?” one says. He speaks in the articulate tone that you’ve come to expect from the natives.\n\n“No. They are free,” E’ffy says. “He is the bondsman. Amir’sshan has chosen.”\n\nYou know a cue when you see one. You pull the artifact into view, spiraling the dagger around the palm of your hand a few times. Unlike most daggers, it doesn’t flash with being brought into light, ravenlight or natural. Rather, it shines with true darkness, the cave around it simply an imposter darkness shying away from the black mithril.\n\n“Are...are you sure?” the other Blackbird speaks. You’re not used to such timidity from the natives. His tone reminds you of a child asking a parent to visit a friend’s home.\n\nYou didn’t miss the first cue and you sure as hell aren’t going to miss the second. Small thunderclouds. Black smoke, true black smoke, appears in the darkness of the cave. The artifact becomes a weapon that the blackbirds would recognize--well, that they would appreciate. The blade transforms into an axe head, keeping the same wing-tipped handle, although it grows in length to keep balance with the axe.\n\n(Looking for a round of applause, hero?)\n\n“E’ffy, Terr’ok is not going to like this.”\n\n“Or us letting you pass,” the other inputs.\n\n“Then take it up with my father,” E’ffy quickly answers. She seemed to have that one locked and loaded like an Alteran flintlock, standard issue. Double-barreled. It’s definitely not the first and probably won’t be the last time the priestess got her way by involving her father, whoever he may be. You can’t help but notice the threat was backed by tribal standing rather than religious. Although being a priestess, even for an older sect, she does not use that to get her way. Whoever her father may be holds more influence than her status as a priestess.\n\n“We hold no quarrel with Chieftain Malic’ant. Pass through, quickly. And do not mention our names.”\n\n“Thank you, brothers,” E’ffy says and waves you forward. Redding flashes a smile towards the pair of warriors as you pass. They don’t return the gesture. After passing by the initial scouts, you come across four more checkpoints, each one holding more Blackbird warriors than the last. The encounters are handled similarly, each one becoming more smooth than the last now that you know the questions asked and the answers to get waved through. The resemblance between the way the warriors act compared with the chain of command of Alteran is uncanny. In an entire New World, men know their places and aren’t willing to risk upsetting the CO, commanding officer, above them in rank. The High King loves his chain of command, sure; the Blackbirds appear to love it as well. And at the top, rules E’ffy, with her father, Chieftain Malic’ant’s name on the tip of her tongue.\n\nThe path opens up into a--cavern would be the wrong way to describe it, not that it wouldn’t be completely inaccurate. It’s essentially a large city, albeit underground. It’s a large a space that you’ve seen; the ceiling itself can’t even be witnessed. The top lies somewhere above where the abundance of ravenlight can’t even reach. It might be a few feet in the darkness. It might be five-hundred. Like the opposite of a deep body of water, the height of the ceiling is endless. Ravenlight is in abundance, but you see very few actual torches.\n\n“The plants,” E’ffy explains. “They blossom light.”\n\nSure enough, as you’re becoming accustomed to in the New World--even underground--plants are everywhere. Here, however, they are root-like vines that touch every building and structure, which themselves are built from stone blocks. The Alterans may consider the natives a primitive people compared to their own “civilized” culture, but there’s no denying the Blackbirds aren’t the stone hut simpletons that they’re made out to be...even though their houses may be stone huts. The huts themselves are circularly built, like a large version of a Magda buckler.\n\nThere are less of them than you imagined. The war party that attacked the garrison was large in number, yes, and it appears that they didn’t have any reserve soldiers. Which makes you wonder if the Blackbirds lack military strategy. Perhaps. They stand taller and physically stronger than the average Alteran. Put together, though, the formations of Alteran are an impenetrable shield, and on the offensive, a dagger piercing between links of armor. You see warriors helping with daily chores, a few watering domesticated animals, harvesting rows of planted food. Only in the New World could one farm underground.\n\n“This way. To the temple.”\n\nYou and Redding allow E’ffy to lead you to the temple. Everywhere you look, eyes are fixed upon you. It’s eerie in a sense. All attention is drawn towards you; it’s as if you’re walking through the hallways of the High King’s palace buck naked. Most hold confused stares, others look as if they want to draw their axes here and now. Under E’ffy’s protection, you guess that would be a big disobedience of their laws. Lucky you. You’re not sure what exactly you were expecting or how she planned to remove the S’umbra from the equation, but you didn’t imagine waltzing directly through the center of their war camp, which itself, doesn’t much keep to the “war” part of war camp.\n\nThe temple’s in the corner of the war camp, built against the wall of the “cavern” itself. Like the other buildings, it’s built from stone with round walls. There’s an outer layer. An outer and inner sanctum of sorts. You pass through the unguarded gate, not much more than an open doorway leading into a series of altars and mats lying on the floor. It bears resemblance to the halls of the dead, the mats are the same, even the altar looks like the one where you first discovered the ravenlight torch many days ago.\n\nThe inner sanctum is an empty room, built, unsurprisingly at this point, like the tomb where you battled the lich, although instead of a sarcophagus, a large stone altar lies in the center, the rest of the room arranged around it. It’s empty minus a frail-looking Blackbird dressed in a tattered brown robe. The man looks about your height, a runt for the natives. Rather than the long braided hair of the warriors you’ve faced--even E’ffy wears a single braid, the Blackbird has his black hair cut bowl-like, as if shaped like the huts of the war camp.\n\n(A few nails missing in the construction of this one, I think.)\nYou know, we might actually agree here for once.\n\n“My priestess! You can not allow these, these, these...outsiders to enter into such a holy place!”\n\n“Calm down, Onng. These are our guests,” E’ffy answers with a practiced patience that you’re sure she’s built up over a timespan spent with the man. His name is Onng. By the High King’s pristine chamber pot, even the man’s name is different from the other natives.\n\n“If the others learn of this…this, abomination! Then they will surely force us from serving the Raven.”\n\n“They will do no such thing,” E’ffy says with a casual demeanor, like that of swatting a buzzing fly.\n\nRedding strides up to Onng. No stranger to peculiarity, he offers a hand in greeting. “Onng, is it? You can call me Redding. And you can call him,” he points to you. “You can call him--”\n\n“I will call you outsiders, is what I will call you,” Ongg cuts him off before you can be properly introduced. He seems to take pride in his words as a great big ol’ smile appears at his mouth, highlighting a few gaps within his teeth.\n\n“You will call them guests and nothing more,” E’ffy says as if scolding a child for not getting into bed on time.\n\n“All right, ‘guests.’”\n\n“Thank you kindly,” Redding answers, taking a sweeping bow, a gesture that Onng tries to imitate.\n\nE’ffy laughs. “Onng has been serving the Raven since birth. His parents...are not with us.” What started out as a friendly statement quickly turned sour. “Make yourself comfortable. There is food and drink over there. (She points to another doorway at the end of the room.)\n\n“With respect,” you say. “I think I’d rather hear of your plan to defeat the false priests before settling in. I don’t think I could be ‘comfortable’ otherwise.”\n\n“You are WHAT?”\n\nE’ffy ignores the outburst from Onng. Probably something she’s used to doing. “Are you sure? It would be good to replenish your energy.”\n",
  "page 92": "That girl. That dreadful girl. A thorn in the paw of the S’umbra. The things a beautiful girl can get away with that would normally see a man executed. Even for the Harri’ar, a practical people, she is treated differently. She might not see. She would most certainly deny it. But the fact remains: E’ffy, sole offspring of Chieftain Malic’ant, priestess of the old ways, gets away with damn more than she should. A man would be executed. The tribe puts up with the woman.\n\nThat girl. That dreadful girl. A thorn in the paw. Nothing more than that.\n\nThe outsiders have sailed across the Great Sea in their wooden horses. They have set upon the land with no regard for the Earth Mother and Father Sun. This is not the first time that it has happened. And it will not be the last. The first outsiders were sent west with their tail between their legs. Time is a wheel. What has happened before will happen again. Terr’ok, High Priest of the S’umbra will send them to defeat once again.\n\nIt began with an idea. No, that’s not true. It began with a vision from the Raven Himself. A dream came to Terr’ok. At that time he was a lowly shaman, a magician, with no order to uphold his faith. A man cut from the order is weak, a lone branch to be snapped in half. With the order, however, with the combined strength they are a mighty fortress, a wall reinforced with the binding of power.\n\nThunder crashed. Lightning flashed across the nightsky, an otherwise starless night. In a single bolt, the entire heavens were revealed, stars appearing into existence for a brief moment before hiding back behind the veil. Terr’ok, exposed to the elements, stood at the top of a mountain; rocks as black as the sky above rested underneath his leather boots. He was dressed in dark purple ceremonial robes, the only clothes he owns. The mountainside was unforgiving. Jagged rocks lined his path, attempting to throw him from the pilgrimage in a deadly fall, or even worse, a stumble of the foot, leaving him with a broken bone to face the ferocity of nature. A minor nuisance. Nothing would get in the way of his path. Not nature, not the elements, not even the Father Sun Himself. Blasphemy. Heretical. Terr’ok was set upon the path. All else be damned.\n\nThe thought frightened him. A man taught from an early age to follow the way of the gods should feel fear when opposing the very ideology that he was born to fulfill. Unless they taught him wrong. Unless the very ideology that he was meant to follow was wrong. A child does not know right from wrong, the truth from lies. They do as they are told. If they are scolded, then they know what to avoid. But who was to say their teacher is right? It was pure chance. Luck. Still, the afterlife is not something to be taken lightly. A man only had one chance at living right.\n\nLightning flashed. Shadows returned to their constant stalk.\n\nThe very heavens opened up and rain poured down upon Terr’ok. His robe was soaked through, clinging to his body like a second layer of skin. His beard held a steady drip, like a wine pitcher with a leak at the bottom. The voice guided him this far, foreign at first. Small whisperings in the night, pointing, guiding. Subtle at first. Now with his ear attuned, it might as well be the thunder crashing overhead.\n\nGo. Climb. Find.\n\nAlways in small words. Simple words of actions. It pained him greatly early on. Go where? Climb what? Find what? The magnitude of a misinterpretation is great. He could arrive in the wrong place. Climb the wrong mountain. Find the wrong artifact. Wrong, wrong, wrong. A man only had one chance at living right. One chance. Slowly, he learned. A small action, originating from a single word. Confirmation. Go. Climb. Find. Decades he has followed the voice, now his greatest ally. It’s saved his life, ended others’. The tribe doesn’t understand. Only but a few do. They will be well rewarded for their belief, their bravery in the face of misguided ideology and religion. S’umbra. The voice whispered it in his ear, showed Terr’ok a vision of what the sect of the Raven could accomplish by unifying the tribes. One day.\n\nUpon the mountain, the Raven showed him the way. The Raven! The voice that spoke in his mind was from the Raven. Terr’ok climbed to the top of the mountain, to the very top of the world. All stood before him, below him. What the outsiders called the New World was but a small speck on Mother Earth before him. This is the view of the Raven! A vantage point overlooking all life; the heavens were but an arm’s reach away. At the top, a naturally formed altar rested. It’s made from blackrock, not exactly smooth on the top, but flat enough. It’s rough, as things often are. On it sat a dagger, wing-tipped handle, its blade black.\n\nFollow. Take.\n\nTwo simple words. Follow the Raven. Take the artifact. It lies buried, guarded by the last bondsman and his warriors, a fate of eternal unrest thrust upon them, which they gladly took. For even in death--undeath--those devoted to the Raven will surrender their lives, just as they did walking among the living. The bondsman, a priest of tremendous power, powerful enough to bind his soul and those of his warriors to the halls of the dead, bound as protectors, sacrificing their eternal souls in the process. Their devotion is little compared to Terr’ok’s.\n\nThe once-shaman stepped forward towards the altar. Thunder boomed. Lighting illuminated the nightsky for a second’s fraction. For a brief moment, in place of a dagger was a man, ghastly in form, a body that cannot be counted as physical. His face, hideous. Sinister. Not in the way one would expect. Not scarred, misshapen. It’s symmetrical, like many of the great chieftains who fathered hundreds of children. No, the phantom’s face brought a new meaning to the word. It’s what the man behind the face knows, terrible secrets and the strength to enact each one, a mind unforged, running rampant like the jungle of the land. Cruelty followed the face, sure as the Father Sun will rise each morning. Death preceded it. Followed it. Yearned for it.\n\nThat girl. That dreadful girl is on her way to the war camp. Terr’ok’s eyes have told him as such. And she is arriving with two outsiders. They are under her protection for the moment. Terr’ok’s lips turn upward in a smile, true as the day, yet it would look forced to any observer. The girl is putting herself at risk too. Should the chieftains decide she has abandoned the family for the outsiders, her fate will be the same as theirs, daughter of Chieftain Malic’ant or no. Yes, Terr’ok’s smile continues. The Raven’s will be done.\n",
  "page 95": "“On a second thought,” you say, stomach grumbling. “I might replenish if we will be here awhile.”\n\n“Very well. Supplies are through the doorway,” E’ffy says, turning to Ongg. They start a conversation in which you hear very little. The doorway leads into a long hallway filled with various paintings. They’re primitive, sort of what the average Alteran would expect from the Blackbirds. Natural dyes, blotchy figures. They aren’t aren’t housed within extravagant frames like the Old World would display artwork. They’re on slabs of gray stone, illumined by ravenlight, no doubt masking the actual dye colors in a ravenblack shade. You’re fairly positive one of them would cost a fortune in Alteran, where art itself is already overpriced. An original Blackbird piece, the only one of its kind--yeah, you could live comfortably off one for a few years, you suppose.\n\nThe hallway continues into a small kitchen that doubles up as a storeroom. Wicker baskets line the edges, their contents mostly hidden by lids, although you see some (New World) rice and dried meats. It’s the dried meat that you go for. Smoked and seasoned. Not a bad way to stave off hunger for a bit. You chip away at a sizable piece and slightly wonder what kind of animal you’re eating. As far as you know, the Blackbirds aren’t cannibals, despite the propaganda of Alteran. No, you’re pretty sure you’ve heard the term tossed in their direction before; they’ll say anything though.\n\n“It’s not a person if that’s what you’re wondering,” Redding breaks the silence, taking a sizable bit out of his own piece of meat.\n\n“That’s exactly what I was wondering,” you say. Redding finds a jug and pours some of its contents into a cup. It’s a type of red wine. You connect the dot with the Blackbird paintings. “You know, somewhere across the sea there’s an Alteran nobility who would give a small fortune for a cup of Blackbird wine. The same goes for the drawings on the wall.”\n\n“And yet the wine and paintings are cheaply acquired here,” Redding completes the thought. “Cup?”\n\nYou nod. While you realize the importance of keeping your wits about, the opportunity to taste Blackbird wine is something that you simply cannot pass up. You locate a cup, an unmarked thing of clay, and offer it to Redding, who finishes his and fills his own cup again before getting to yours.\n\n“Cheers,” you say, clinking the small cups together. Sweetness assaults your tongue. The flavor is close to the berries that E’ffy picked for you earlier. There’s something else, however. A deep flavor that you can only describe as smokiness, like the flavor of campfire, cooking a roasted...Oh. The flavor of the dried meat was likely still in your mouth. Still, it’s not a bad combination with the sweet flavor of the wine. For the first time since encountering E’ffy in the jungle and asking for her help, it’s you and Redding alone.\n\n“Regret coming here?” you ask.\n\nRedding takes a bite of jerky and finishes with a sip of wine. “Not at the present moment, no.”\n\n“And after your stomach is full?”\n\nHe pauses to think. “No, I don’t think so. If what the girl says is true, then the Blackbirds are poisoned by the same thing as the Old World...likely an aftereffect of the first explorers.”\n\nMeaning his ancestor, Jeremiah Reddish, helped poison the New World, but you don’t voice it. Speaking ill of the dead is always unwarranted for an Alteran, especially when it’s a family member of the one you’re speaking with.\n\n“Still,” he continues. “The girl is a poor planner. That much is clear. Any sort of surprise advantage we had by our alliying is gone. Not that I have much experience with removing tribal leaders from power, but that sort of thing probably works best without announcing your attention and walking through the front door.”\n\n“We can agree on that,” you say. “They certainly do things differently than in Alteran here. And it’s not just E’ffy: the guards posted allowed us to walk in freely. It’s like a handshake agreement. There are no secrets to anyone’s intention. The guards will follow whoever’s at the top, and E’ffy and the S’umbra will try to remove each other from the tribe.”\n\n“You know what it is,” Redding leads you on like a schoolmaster. “Honor. Or what they consider to be honor.”\n\n“Mhmm. As long as they face each other in open battle, it’s allowed. Encouraged probably. Plotting, lying, scheming: the traits of the New World haven’t reached them yet, despite their tyrannous government structure. We’re allowed to stroll through the front door, telling the guards that we’re here to kill their leader, and they wave us through.”\n\n“Kill? Here I thought we were going to peacefully remove them from office.”\n\nYou ignore Redding’s sarcasm. “But also, that means when the S’umbra hear of our arrival, and you can be damn sure they have already, it is completely within the realm of possibility that they march on us with all their strength. For honor calls for it.”\n\n(Now you’re getting it.)\n\n“I don’t think so,” Redding muses, taking another sip. “A place like this is sacred. From what I’ve learned about the Blackbirds, starting violence in the temple is a big no-no.”\n\n“Then we’re safe in one building alone,” you answer. “Better get comfortable here.”\n\n“Way ahead of you there, kid.” Redding finishes his second cup.\n\n“Take it easy. We’d better get back to E’ffy,” you say. Redding takes another glance at the wine, ponders a moment, and then leaves it behind. Back the way you go, past the paintings that would cost a pretty penny in Alteran, back to E’ffy in the main chamber of the temple. Its similarity to the halls of the dead don’t escape you; hopefully this time there is less death. To be fair, it was in the name.\n",
  "page 94": "“So let’s hear it,” you say, resting on one of the floor mats. Man it feels good to take a load off. There’s been a good deal of walking over the past few days; a lot of exertion ever since arriving to the New World and getting rained upon, likely from the very Blackbirds that you share a camp with now.\n\n“Hear what?” E’ffy asks, innocently.\n\n“The plan,” you snap back, a little annoyed. Instantly, Ongg’s face curls into a frown. It looks like a small mutt trying to be menacing to a war hound. “How we are going to remove the S’umbra from their clutch over the tribes, how we are going to free your people to live by their own chieftain.”\n\n“It is simple,” E’ffy starts, “we issue a challenge by the ways of Harri’katan.”\n\n“Which is…” Redding prods with his question.\n\n“They do not know, priestess,” Onng whispers. E’ffy ignores the man.\n\n“Harri’katan, once the prized jewel of our people,” E’ffy says. “Imagine a city the size of a nation, built from the very earth itself. These are our ancestors. They drove the outsiders west many centuries ago. (Redding nods his agreement). But they have fallen from favor. Our people, the Harri’ar are lost. It is the S’umbra leading them astray. Without the false priests, they will revisit the laws of tradition.”\n\n“With respect,” you say. “That does not explain it at all. And you mean to call the laws of an ancient city? Isn’t the point to allow the tribes to rule themselves no longer under the thumb of the S’umbra?”\n\n“Each tribe has a choice. We are stronger united by the Raven.”\n\nYou’re becoming a little frustrated at this point, with good reason. E’ffy seems to be taking you round and round with her logic. “Then what the hell are we doing? Exchanging one leader for another? If it is freedom that your people want, then they should take it themselves, not surrender themselves to the yoke of servitude.”\n\n“You would do best to soften your tone in a holy place such as this,” E’ffy hisses. Her face turns from a sunny sky into approaching storm clouds.\n\n“E’ffy,” Redding speaks in a calm tone. “Tell us about the challenge.”\n\nThe storm clouds hold a moment, but linger. An overcast priestess answers Redding. “A challenge issued, the challenger must run the trial. If they survive, then they must face the ruler’s champion.”\n\n“See? That wasn’t so hard.” You intentionally shift your tone after your initial words, hard as it may be in your current state. “What entails the trial?”\n\n“The gauntlet of the gods,” E’ffy says. “The challenger must prove they are worthy among the divine before they can face the champion in combat. Otherwise the greatest warrior would always rule.. and only hold it for as long as their strength allowed it. The ruler must be strong, but also chosen. They must win over the people before being considered.”\n\n“But what exactly is it?”\n\n“A sacred tunnel in these caves. It is no accident that the war camp has taken place here. My father had some influence in the matter.” This brings a smile to E’ffy’s lips. The weather changes quickly in her presence.\n\n“And what lies within the tunnel?” you ask.\n\n“I do not know,” she answers. “The trial hasn’t been run in many years.”\n\n“Well… when was the last time it was won?” Redding inputs.\n\n“Generations.”\n\n(You know the simpler plan would be to stroll into the S’umbra’s hut and allow me to...talk with them.)\nAnd what would that solve? Those loyal would take their place.\n(A show of strength. That you are above their laws.)\nSomehow I don’t think that would help the Blackbirds any.\n(It’d help you...and the priestess. You have, what do they say, bigger fish to fry?)\n\n“Hello?” E’ffy says.\n\n“Don’t mind the kid,” REdding jumps in. “he tends to do that when the artifact whispers to him.”\n\n“Amir’sshan…” E’ffy utters, in awe. “What does he say?”\n\n(I’m flattered, but you don’t need to ask for my permission.)\n\n“He says that we could end the S’umbra without the challenge. With the artifact--err, Amir’sshan--we have all the firepower we need to remove the S’umbra from their place of rule. I ended the undead defender with a single bullet. I could do the same for these priests of yours.”\n\n“Amir’sshan, brutally straightforward as always.”\n\nShe speaks as if she knows you.\n(They all do. I’m somewhat of a legend myself.)\nEnough of a legend to justify executing a sect of native priests?\n(Not all legends are heroes, hero.)\n\n“The way I see it, is that we have two options presented in front of us,” Redding says, taking on a familiar tone that you’re used to hearing as he addresses the company. “Take the difficult path leading into a treacherous tunnel, unknown danger hiding in the shadows. Or we can do what we soldiers do best: draw blood and keep drawing until it no longer flows.”\n\n(I know what I vote for.)\nGood thing you don’t get one.\n\n“Those in favor of the trial?” Redding asks. E’ffy raises a hand in her decision. Onng, seeing his priestess’ gesture, quickly raises his own palm. “And those for the direct approach?” Redding raises his hand while speaking. He waits for you to raise yours.\n\n“Amir’sshan counts as two,” E’ffy says. “Even if it goes against my own belief. I would not choose against Amir’sshan in anything other than this,” she affirms. “In this, I am set. The Raven guide us.”\n\n“What’ll it be, tiebreaker?” Redding says, his hand still raised. “The trial or the soldier’s approach?”\n",
  "page 97": "Before you can answer, a loud knock appears on the door, a dull thud echoing just twice; the door swings open instantly upon the second knock, the newcomer(s) not willing to wait for someone to answer. It’s a temple, after all. The fact that they’re knocking on the door is as puzzling as only knocking twice, as opposed to the civil Alteran three, maybe four knocks.\n\nA lone man enters the temple. He may enter alone, but you see Blackbird warriors, escorts, in the outer sanctum. The man is dressed in dark purple robes, tattered at the edges. A deep hood rests lightly on the crown of his head, deep enough to hide the features of his face if pulled low. It doesn’t take the option, however. Here, in the war camp, you doubt it’s ever utilized for such a purpose. Hard to hide from those who already know your face. Thus enters Terr’ok, high priest of the S’umbra, acting chieftain of chieftains of the Harri’ar, enemy of E’ffy.\n\n“E’ffy, my girl,” he purrs, a voice that would be soothing coming from anyone but the current man in front of you. He’s far younger than you imagined, likely not having forty years to his name. The wisdom he, perhaps, would have gained with more years is replaced with the prime of youth, both in mental capacity and physical prowess, something that normally isn’t attributed to a man of the cloth. Terr’ok rests on a wooden staff, a raven carved at the very top.\n\n“Terr’ok,” E’ffy confirms his identity. Tare-ock. “Have you come here seeking salvation?”\n\n“I’m afraid, my dear, that has already been secured for me. Yours, however…” He speaks differently than the other Blackbirds. The Blackbirds you’ve heard speak all have used short, articulate words. Terr’ok’s, however, draws his words out, sliding them into one another like the oral version of a diplomat’s signature.\n\n(END HIM HERE! Draw me. Put six bullets in his head. He-he. Oh yes, make him bleed. Bleed! BLEEEEED.)\n\nThe strength of the voice collapses you to your knees, both hands clutching on either side of your head. Pain. It’s as if someone fired a flintlock next to both ears, then whipped you across the back of the head. An incoherent groan escapes your lips as Onng, surprisingly, rushes to your side and helps you back to your feet.\n\n“Such is the strength of those in opposition to a true devotee of the Raven!” Terr’ok points the ravenhead staff towards you, who currently lean against, again--surprisingly, Onng for support. “Such is the strength of the tek’usan you would call ally.”\n\nE’ffy glares at the high priest; the storm clouds approaching again, threatening to shower the world in rainfall and lightning. “What are you doing here?”\n\n“I came to see the tek’usan that you have brought under the protection of your flimsy wings.” You notice the play on words. Typically the phrase is brought under the protection of the Raven’s protective wing. A clever one, this Terr’ok.\n\n(Stand. Rise. Draw me. Cut. His.Throat.)\n\n“And this is the bondsman?” Terr’ok turns his attention towards you. You’re currently wishing that E’ffy didn’t tell every Blackbird warrior from here to Alteran that the artifact bonded with you. “The one that Amir’sshan chose? He is the mad-god, indeed.”\n\n“Out!” E’ffy bursts with a finger pointed at the door. “You do not come into a sacred place and blaspheme. You know better, high priest.”\n\nIs that really so offensive?\n(Blood must be spilled. It is justified.)\n...I’ll take that as a yes.\n\n“My sincerest apologies, priestess. I look forward to our next meeting. “Terr’ok performs a haphazard bow, turns, and leaves. Through the door, you see the two Blackbird warriors tail closely behind the high priest, each flanking one side of the man. You continue leaning on Onng for a few moments before strength returns to your body. It’s quiet in the temple, its inhabitants still registering the sudden confrontation of the man you plan to kill. He dare visit you unarmed, leaving his escort outside? Either it’s overconfidence or he knew something you didn’t, a thought that E’ffy confirms.\n\n“It is good you did not try to kill him.”\n\n“I was a little busy,” you answer.\n\n“I was not talking to you,” she says, looking at Redding. “Terr’ok had many unseen protections around him. Your weapons would have had no effect on him.”\n\n“Not all of them, I suppose,” Redding answers, gesturing at the artifact. “What the hell was that? You’re not one to get jumpy before battle.”\n\n“The voice was screaming at me. It was like someone was hammering nails into my skull,” you say. “It didn’t seem...all together there.” You’re careful to avoid words such as “insane” or the Raven forbid, “mad.” You saw the way it set E’ffy off, even speaking on it now makes you nervous.\n\n“What was it saying?”\n\n“It wanted me to kill Terr’ok.”\n\n“He will answer for what he has done. But we will defeat him by honorable means,” E’ffy affirms.\n\nRedding counters. “Honorable means don’t exist in war, only the victorious and the defeated.”\n\n“W-we have a path forward,” Ongg gathers the foursome back together. “L-l-let us stick to it.”\n\nThe man with obvious ailments refocuses you. Funny how someone with apparent shortcomings, a mind stunted, can speak the exact words needed. A path was determined, its beginning interrupted by the sudden appearance of Terr’ok, but it’s still in motion. It’s what you believe to be the best chance at defeating the priests. And it will be the first of many victories, for your journey does not end with the Blackbirds, despite your feeling that you’re nearing the end of this chapter. As a whole, the journey’s only just starting out.\n\n(You missed your chance.)\nWasn’t much of one with your impairment.\n(Promise me one thing.)\nWhich is...?\n(You’ll use me to end the man’s life.)\nI promise. Why do you hate the priest?\n(Your oath binds us. I am not simply bonded to you. But now you to me. I will reveal all when the sun sets.)\n",
  "page 96": "“So let’s hear it,” you say, resting on one of the floor mats. Man it feels good to take a load off. There’s been a good deal of walking over the past few days; a lot of exertion ever since arriving to the New World and getting rained upon, likely from the very Blackbirds that you share a camp with now.\n\n“Hear what?” E’ffy asks, innocently.\n\n“The plan,” you snap back, a little annoyed. Instantly, Ongg’s face curls into a frown. It looks like a small mutt trying to be menacing to a war hound. “How we are going to remove the S’umbra from their clutch over the tribes, how we are going to free your people to live by their own chieftain.”\n\n“It is simple,” E’ffy starts, “we issue a challenge by the ways of Harri’katan.”\n\n“Which is…” Redding prods with his question.\n\n“They do not know, priestess,” Onng whispers. E’ffy ignores the man.\n\n“Harri’katan, once the prized jewel of our people,” E’ffy says. “Imagine a city the size of a nation, built from the very earth itself. These are our ancestors. They drove the outsiders west many centuries ago. (Redding nods his agreement). But they have fallen from favor. Our people, the Harri’ar are lost. It is the S’umbra leading them astray. Without the false priests, they will revisit the laws of tradition.”\n\n“With respect,” you say. “That does not explain it at all. And you mean to call the laws of an ancient city? Isn’t the point to allow the tribes to rule themselves no longer under the thumb of the S’umbra?”\n\n“Each tribe has a choice. We are stronger united by the Raven.”\n\nYou’re becoming a little frustrated at this point, with good reason. E’ffy seems to be taking you round and round with her logic. “Then what the hell are we doing? Exchanging one leader for another? If it is freedom that your people want, then they should take it themselves, not surrender themselves to the yoke of servitude.”\n\n“You would do best to soften your tone in a holy place such as this,” E’ffy hisses. Her face turns from a sunny sky into approaching storm clouds.\n\n“E’ffy,” Redding speaks in a calm tone. “Tell us about the challenge.”\n\nThe storm clouds hold a moment, but linger. An overcast priestess answers Redding. “A challenge issued, the challenger must run the trial. If they survive, then they must face the ruler’s champion.”\n\n“See? That wasn’t so hard.” You intentionally shift your tone after your initial words, hard as it may be in your current state. “What entails the trial?”\n\n“The gauntlet of the gods,” E’ffy says. “The challenger must prove they are worthy among the divine before they can face the champion in combat. Otherwise the greatest warrior would always rule.. and only hold it for as long as their strength allowed it. The ruler must be strong, but also chosen. They must win over the people before being considered.”\n\n“But what exactly is it?”\n\n“A sacred tunnel in these caves. It is no accident that the war camp has taken place here. My father had some influence in the matter.” This brings a smile to E’ffy’s lips. The weather changes quickly in her presence.\n\n“And what lies within the tunnel?” you ask.\n\n“I do not know,” she answers. “The trial hasn’t been run in many years.”\n\n“Well… when was the last time it was won?” Redding inputs.\n\n“Generations.”\n\n(You know the simpler plan would be to stroll into the S’umbra’s hut and allow me to...talk with them.)\nAnd what would that solve? Those loyal would take their place.\n(A show of strength. That you are above their laws.)\nSomehow I don’t think that would help the Blackbirds any.\n(It’d help you...and the priestess. You have, what do they say, bigger fish to fry?)\n\n“Hello?” E’ffy says.\n\n“Don’t mind the kid,” REdding jumps in. “he tends to do that when the artifact whispers to him.”\n\n“Amir’sshan…” E’ffy utters, in awe. “What does he say?”\n\n(I’m flattered, but you don’t need to ask for my permission.)\n\n“He says that we could end the S’umbra without the challenge.

  "page 134": "Nighttime falls. Rather than magelight, traditional flame torches line the interior of the fort, sending shadows dancing in the wind. The Alterans, in occupation of their rival’s fort, have cause to celebrate tonight: the capture of a turncoat; the execution of a traitor. In a matter of minutes, Redding’s lifeless body will hang from the ramparts. Such is the punishment for betrayal.\n\nOnce again you find yourself in a place you thought you’d never revisit, and like the creek, you have a feeling it will be your last. It wasn\u0027t hard to catch an Alteran patrol unaware. Standard protocol doesn’t leave much room for deviation. No, you knew exactly where the four soldiers would be patrolling and exactly the distance around the keep. By the time their bodies are found, you’ll be long gone. Keeping pace with your environment, you’re dressed in Alteran blue, a generous gift from one of the patrolling soldiers. It’s a little tight around the shoulders, but hey, free is free.\n\nThey’ve gathered you, the majority of the Alteran occupation, in the center of the fort facing the ramparts. Alterans like their speeches, after all. Rows and rows of blue stand perfectly at attention, patiently waiting for the three men on the ramparts to begin the festivities, Captain Briggs, Lionel, and a third that you don’t recognize. At their feet sits the object that’s brought you here. It sits a coiled snake, a predator lying in wait. The noose.\n\nYou have a hood pulled, covering the top half of your face. Not that you expect to run into someone that you know, but better safe than sorry. It’s for their sake. Any recognition of Redding’s “sidekick” would likely be swiftly met with an introduction to your own “sidekick” sitting on your hip, a black, wing-tipped artifact craving more action. You don’t have to wait long. This is the military. Schedules are followed. Maintained. Gather the battalion an hour after dusk. A quarter-hour later, hang a man until dead. Back in the bunk by nightfall.\n\n(Any chance you’ll be needing me?)\nA chance, yes.\n\nYou feel the equivalent of a mental sigh. The artifact may be a weapon of immense power, but often the voice appears as an immature child, even more concerning considering what could happen if it decided to act out like immature children tend to do. Movement on the ramparts. Captain Briggs raises a hand to silence the soldiers, who aren’t even speaking amongst themselves.\n\n“By the High King’s guidance, we have arrived across the sea to the New World, a vast, primal place that seeks to claim our lives. The land itself is in direct opposition to our homeland. It’s uncivilized. Its natives, the Blackbirds, are without discipline and order. They are cannibals. Pagans. And as the land will be made New Alteran, so too shall the natives become Alteran...or perish.”\n\nThe soldiers offer a cheer. They know when one’s expected. You do not, however.\n\nAnother hand raise. “Yet, there is one among us who would throw away the High King’s good grace. A traitor. One that would trade his navy for crimson, the color of the High King’s greatest rival. (There’s visible disgust at this. More than a few spit on the ground.) His company was put in chains, herded around like animals. That’s not how a soldier of Alteran should be treated! Enter, traitor. Enter, betrayer. Enter, Redding.” Captain Briggs spits Redding’s name worse than when he mentioned the Supreme Leader Fargrave. You suppose turncoats beat rivals when it comes to levels of disgust. Checks out.\n\nThe formation of soldiers part like running water in a creek, moving around smooth stones. Rather than a moss-covered piece of earth, they make room for a man clad in chains, a pair at both his ankles and wrists. The man doesn’t look disheartened in the least to be arriving at his execution. If anything, he looks pleased, a signature grin at the corner of his lips. You’re not in a town square filled with citizens who would scream curses and throw rotten fruit. You’re at a military camp of the World’s most disciplined army (although the Supreme Leader would disagree); the soldiers are stoic, causing a somber tone to fall over the men. It’s eerie, a thousand men silent, save for the shuffling of feet and clinking of chains. A man is to be put to death. A man who once stood in their place. Perhaps they are imagining themselves in Redding’s boots. After what seems like an eternity, Redding and his escorts travel the switch-back staircase and arrive at the top of the ramparts.\n\nFrom your position--in the middle of the formation--you can hardly see the features of those standing on the ramparts. Redding, you know, likely holds the same grin. There’s a good chance Briggs does as well; it’s a great honor to end the insurgence of the soldiers under your command. No doubt word will get back to Alteran of the great and legendary Captain Briggs, conquering the New World under the High King’s name, putting a traitorous soldier to death as an example to all who would follow in their footsteps. Five now stand, overlooking the Alteran battalion. You watch from the center of the formation.\n\nCaptain Briggs takes a step forward, stares Redding in the eyes, as if determining what to do with the man. Theatrics, of course. He knows damn well what he plans to do. But this is a show for the battalion. A show of dominance. An example to all. He slaps Redding in the face. It couldn’t have been that hard. Slaps are more damaging to the ego than anything else, but the sound rings over the silent crowd in the pitch of an overboard sailor landing flat against the waves of the sea. You can’t hear the words, but it appears Redding fired back with a few choice words. They must have been good ones, from Redding they typically are, as Briggs seems to be affected with the next portion of his speech. Part of theatrics is going off-script. It works well when done effectively. However, when emotion is the cause, it falls flat.\n\n“This...this...traitor,” Briggs spits again, “is to be hung until the breath in his betraying lungs fails. The High King will always triumph against those who would seek to tarnish his good name.” You can’t help but notice the lack of enthusiasm from the soldiers. Typically, whenever the good High King’s name is mentioned, there are visible agreements, at the very least murmurings of affirmation. There’s no such accompaniment. “He will be an example to ALL. The High King’s gaze is vast. He sees all--even the whispers of treason. You, turncoat, any last words?”\n\nRedding takes a step forward. His toes must be hanging over the rampart’s edge. “Yes, a few. More than a few, actually, but I’ll keep it brief. I know you have a date with your sword arm tonight.” Only Redding would crack a joke like that during his execution.\n\n(Kinda wishing I bonded to him now. The man’s anything but a bore.)\nNo you don’t. Otherwise you’d be resting on Briggs’ hip.\n(...fair point.)\n\n“They call me a traitor. They charge me with treason,” Redding continues, then pauses for effect. “And they’re right.” There wasn’t a reaction to the High King’s mentioning, but there sure as hell is now. Low murmurs start between the soldiers, perhaps thinking Redding was originally falsely accused. Here it is, though, confessing to his crimes. Redding’s voice suddenly cracks with thunder, quaking the very ground beneath their boots. A chine runs down your spine.\n\n“BUT THE LAWS OF THE OLD DON’T APPLY TO THE NEW!”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Let the High King govern Alteran. Let him sit and gain weight, fat on his throne. Alteran boasts the best tailors in the world. Surely they can hem his royalty’s robes a few inches out.” You hear one or two snickers. No one would willingly disrespect the High King, although laughter is hard to contain, especially during inappropriate moments. “What right does he have to dictate our lives in the New World? What does he contribute besides helping ease ourselves of the burden of wealth?”\n\nBehind Redding, Captain Briggs motions to Lionel. Your former company member reaches for the noose and examines it before slipping it over Redding’s head. The former corporal doesn’t seem to notice.\n\n“Tell me, have any of you actually seen the High King? Have any of you actually felt his good will? It’s a lie! It’s the whip upon your back, the hand in your coin purse. Your lives are not your own. You’re simply a piece in the machine; the only value placed on your lives is dependent upon how well you perform your part. I’ve taken a step back. I’ve removed myself from the machine entirely. I’m truly free. The High King doesn’t control my life.”\n\nSomeone shouts from the crowd. “Bold words, a man claims to be free while shackled awaiting execution.”\n\nYou can almost feel the grin widening to a full-toothed smile. Redding set the trap perfectly. He raises his arms up, and the soldiers can’t help but audibly gasp. It’s as if they’ve become spectators in a wizard’s light show. The shackles around Redding’s wrists fall from their place, tumbling down the rampart’s staircase in a loud crash--or crashes; you count six in total, a number that you’ve recently become accustomed to counting.\n\n“I am bound by no man. By no idea. I answer only to myself. As should you all. A New World lies at your fingertips and yet you’re content to stay shackled. You’re but oxen doing the bidding of the farmer, docile cattle, with no mind of their own. The World is yours to discover!”\n\nBriggs and the others rush to reclasp the chains around Redding’s wrists. He doesn’t pay them any regard, just continues speaking, words increasingly becoming heard among the battalion.\n\n“I choose my own path. I choose this. I choose to serve as an example, yes--Briggs is right. I face my death as a free man, bound by no unseen leader, free from simply playing a part in a collective machine. No man commands my life but my own. No man commands my death but my own. Freedom is yours for the taking. You’ve got a short amount of years left. Take it.”\n\nWith that, Redding scans the crowd. Somehow, some way, standing within a thousand soldiers his eyes seem to meet yours. It’s as if he sensed your presence, knew that you would follow him to the death. His death. See you on the other side, kid. Redding leaps from the ramparts. Time slows in that moment, his arms outstretched in the air, Briggs and the others unable to completely lock the chains around his wrists. Your eyes, like every single pair in the battalion, grow wide, unable to believe what they are seeing. A man free. A man who has the ability to escape from his shackles--and likely his holding cell--willingly throwing himself to death. The man is choosing to die in the exact way he chose to live: on his own terms.\n\nA sickening crack echoes over the battalion as Redding’s neck snaps on impact, shortly followed by the steady creak of rope, like a ship settling in at sea. Redding’s body lifelessly sways back and forth, the momentum from his jump still carrying his body in movement, like the way a street performer would sway a pocket watch, attempting to hypnotize a volunteer from the crowd. In a way, it’s exactly that. Hypnotizing. The words of power already have been spoken to the crowd. Now it’s up to them to act. And they do.\n\nChaos ensues.\n\nNot six seconds later, and you’re counting, the battalion bursts into motion. Soldier against commander. Soldier against soldier. A thousand soldiers split into two different categories in an instant, those who would be free and those clinging to the ways of the Old. Steel is drawn against former allies. Flintlocks are fired. The roar is unlike anything you’ve ever heard. It’s as if standing underneath a rushing waterfall. It’s louder than any battlefield you’ve fought on, louder than a battering ram punching through a main gate.\n\nYou take part to the artifact’s great joy.\n\n(Finally, finally, finally. I told you that man isn’t--wasn’t--boring!)\n\nWith the surrender of one man’s life, he’s gained the hearts of hundreds of soldiers to his cause. Redding’s body hangs overhead like a religious symbol, and the initiating rites are taking place in the battalion. The artifact becomes a blade in your hand as you don’t have enough time to wait for the reload. Here and there, however, the six-shooter appears to ring quick death before transitioning back to a longsword in small thunderclouds. A few recognize you. It appears on their face in two parts: paralyzing remembrance, then heightened fury. You put them down just the same. The ways of the Old World are dying, and you expedite the process with each swing of your sword, each shot fired.\n\nRedding must have planned this all along, you think mid-swing. That’s why he was content to be taken prisoner--it afforded him the platform to send his message to the entire battalion. Say what you will about the man, there’s something commendable about possessing an ideology that surpasses death. Most men spend their lives avoiding the end; the rare few focus on their mission, placing more emphasis on accomplishing it than avoiding death. Redding used his own death as a tool. The man was right. He’s not bound by anything, even ending his own life.\n\nYou parry a longsword aside and lunge forward, allowing the black blade to taste Alteran blood. Two more stand in your fallen opponent’s place. You don’t wait for them to attack. You meet their sudden appearance with a fury fueled by your mentor’s death, losing yourself to the flow of battle. Thoughts are distant. You know only the next breath, the next swing of your sword. Clarity. Your mind becomes its own, guiding your body; you’re but a passenger on the journey of destruction.\n\nYesterday, it was two men with an idea to transform an entire New World. Today, you’re hundreds, yet even more lie in opposition. WIth the artifact in-hand, the black weapon that will most assuredly draw another war party attack, you cut through the ranks of those holding to the Old ways. You’ll be prepared for their next attack. If they can track the artifact, perhaps the artifact can track the Blackbirds…Redding’s message will transcend nation and borderlines. There are bound to be more in Magda’s tattered garrison that would join the cause, and more are no doubt on their way, voyaging from the Old World.\n\nYesterday, two.\n\nToday, hundreds.\n\nTomorrow, thousands.\n",
  "page 29": "The transports separate in the water, breaking off from one another. They’ll be sitting targets while the soldiers unload. Your defensive vessels, receiving signals from the admiral, move into their position as well. Cannon fire begins a steady volley, almost continuous. Their booming echoes across the water, firing now in staggered groups. While one ship reloads another fires, soon to swap their actions.\n\nThe High King\u0027s discipline takes over. You and your fellow soldiers quickly organize back into formation. Each unit has a designated member to pass out equipment, Bastus being yours. Twelve of you in a line receive gear one at a time. In the chaos of battle, the soldier’s training must be present. Standing still while fire falls from the sky is no easy task, and yet not a single man is out of place.\n\nA pack is thrust into your hands as you follow the man in front of you preparing for landing. Brown, simple leather, the High King\u0027s sigil pressed into one flap. They should be water resistant, at least if the military enchanter did his job correctly. Nothing like trusting your life in the hands of another’s work. You jam your flintlock and accessories into the main compartment. No way in hell are you going to let water damage render the weapon useless.\n\nAdmiral Conway spins the wheel a final time, and shouts, a tinge of glee in her voice. “This is as far as I dare get.”\n\nIt’s still a swim to the beach. But still, comparing the Devastator to the others, you’re a lot closer. She continues.\n\n“Take the fight to them. Get vengeance for the High King. Briggs?”\n\nCaptain Briggs, now on the deck, looks up to the helm and nods. Whatever plans they discussed is silently confirmed with a simple head gesture.\n\n“Very good. Now off with you! For the High King!”\n\nAmong the crowd of soldiers, you stand near the deck’s railing and look down. It’s not a far jump by any means, especially not into water. But still, it’s at least fifteen feet to the bottom. The last thing you want to do is lose travel rations or something as equally necessary underwater. Saying a silent prayer--noticing it’s only in situations such as this that you suddenly become religious, your feet step over the railing into the open air.\n\nWind rushes at your face. A sudden gust. Your body drops quickly. It\u0027s the feeling as if you\u0027re leaning too far in a chair, finding the moment just before tipping over backwards, only continuous.\n\nCold air.\nCold water.\n\nDisorientation accompanies submergence. For a second, you lose sight of which way is towards the surface and panic. Then as quickly as the confusion appears, it’s gone. Others drop next to you, signaling the direction to swim. Your legs kick, arms weaving out in front of your face like a blind man feeling for objects to avoid walking into. Your chest begins to burn, crying out for oxygen. A few more strokes and you reach the surface.\n\nThe water’s surface is littered with swimming bodies. It’s a wonder no one landed directly on top of you. You follow the other soldiers swimming towards the beach, holding your pack in one arm as if it were a man you\u0027re saving from drowning. Your breath turns slow and deliberate in energy conservation. Flailing in the water is a sure way to arrive exhausted, considering you’d even make it to the shore. Deep down you know the swim is only the first bit. No doubt you’ll be marching towards Frontrunner\u0027s Camp without rest, that is, if the Captain’s orders are to make it to the RZ. There’s always the chance Briggs orders you to march directly to your attackers.\n\nWhatever the decision may be, there\u0027s only one in your current position. Breathe and swim, breathe and swim.\n\n---\n\nRelief rushes through your body as the water becomes shallow enough to stand. It’s still difficult, wading through neck-high water, not to mention the cold spray from each passing wave, but it sure as hell beats swimming, as do most things. Your hand instinctively reaches for your right shoulder. A second wave of relief hits you as your wet palm finds the handle of your longsword. Miraculously it didn’t drift away during the plunge. You glance around at your fellow soldiers. Apparently, it’s not that much of a miracle as about half still hold weapons in their sheathes. Still, that leaves the other half with empty hands. Hopefully they were smart enough to stash something into their waterproof pack.\n\nWithout your immediate superiors in the area, you’re content to stand still and catch your breath while you wait for orders. The only thing the High King’s army hates more than a non-busy soldier is one who thinks for himself outside of direct orders. Since there are no current ones, you take the former approach. Admiral Conway’s fleet grows smaller on the horizon, the ships retreating away from the land mass. Out of range, the fiery destruction is halted. The beach must be too close as no fireballs fill the sky above you. They did originate from elevation. Firing straight down toward the beach would have a rather awkward angle. That, or your attackers are concerned about setting the entire forest on fire. Perhaps, both.\n\nThe crowd of gathering soldiers begins to part. A lone man walks down the sudden aisle. Captain Briggs. His heavy overcoat is drenched and matted down, like that of mutt spending all night in the rain. The man doesn’t look happy at all. A constant frown curves each end of his lips downward. You wring out a few drops of water from your shoulder-length hair as he speaks. Expecting another grand speech, you’re surprised with the lone sentence that comes from Briggs’ mouth.\n\n“Welcome to the New World.”\n",
  "page 135": "A cave, deep in the New World forest, overlooks the sea, facing towards the Old World. Nearly a year ago, you arrived by ship, a soldier in the High King’s army. Now you take the role of fugitive, hunted by your former nation as well as the native Blackbirds for the artifact you possess, an artifact that plays on your thoughts, speaking to you. Enemies are everywhere. Friends are few. But there are some, a small number, yes, but more than the one you started with. Speaking of the one, Redding emerges from the cave, his scraggly beard showing obvious signs where trimming is needed, even more so with its long length.\n\n“We best get a move on,” he says, alluding to the fact that you’re unable to stay in one place for very long.\n\nThe Blackbirds can sense the artifact, somehow. It’s the reason they attacked the garrison shortly after recovering it in the first place. You didn’t realize it then--thought it was just a coincidence; however, the hideouts you’ve built for yourself over the next few months all were discovered by the Blackbirds. You’ve honed in on their timing, spending only less than two weeks at any given location. It’s not ideal, but there are more important issues. Voyages from the Old World seem to arrive by the day. An exaggeration, but still, they’ve definitely picked up, civilian ships starting to join the navy vessels.\n\nYou sit outside of the cave stoking a small fire. After spending most of your time under the forest’s canopy for the past year, you’ve come to enjoy the time spent in the open air. The sky is a blanket of gray, coupled with snow-white fog, which hangs near the tops of the forest’s trees. Full of life. Sinister. The New World is a place unlike any other. One moment it brings the thrill of discovery, the next, you’re staring death in the face.\n\n(Enough reflection. ‘Best get a move on.’ There’s blood to spill he-he...)\n\nYou ignore the voice, which has become your normal response over the past months. It’s...changed, only concerned with battle, killing, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Blackbird or Old World blood. It thirsts. The frightening part is that you feel it too, a dry scratch at the back of your throat like waking up in the morning after a few too many ales. Satisfaction comes during skirmishes, but you haven’t had any grand-scale battles since the garrison, small drops to wet the tongue; not enough to quench the thirst completely.\n\nThe water nearly to a boil, you pull a small pot away from the flame. Searching through your bag, you pull a small pouch of ground coffee, perks of your few friends. The warm liquid soothes your mind, a small comfort in a world of death and uncertainty. You offer some to Redding who shakes his head. “There’s only one other thing I’d rather drink than water and the ale room doesn’t open until mid-morning,” he says.\n\n“That and your face is probably a poster on the wall, a sizable sum underneath it,” you answer.\n\n“True, true.”\n\nNo, there haven’t been more grand-scale battles. To the artifact’s dismay, your war is being fought on a different battlefield. Rather than finding victory by strength of sword arm and superior numbers, you’re forced to fight on an individual level, your words of persuasion more of an ally than any sword, black blade or not. Oh sure, you’re glad to have it when your words meet deaf ears, or those ears who find it their duty to cross blades against those who whisper such treasonous language. Then the artifact is momentarily happy, letting you hear each gleeful bite into the flesh of a man.\n\nWith more civilian vessels arriving, it at least allows you to infiltrate the Old World colonies with ease. Rather than needing a clean military uniform and names of a company and commander, you can pose as a common merchant, an explorer from the Old World journeying to the New to find fortune and fame. It’s a good thing Frontrunner’s Camp didn’t build walls; it would have long expanded past them.\n\nIn only a year’s time since you arrived, the stain of Old World civilization is starting to affect the New. It starts with Frontrunner’s, but you know there are plans for many more colonies, which makes your mission that much more urgent. Get to the people while they are expanding before anything firm can be established. The World as a whole is on a knife’s edge, could swing either way. You and Redding are doing your best to topple it in your favor, in the collective people’s favor.\n\n(Too much sitting around. Need more action.)\n\n“There’ll be a time for that, don’t you worry,” Redding answers. Wait. Redding answered the voice? The man doesn’t look at you as if some strange circumstance just occurred. He packs his bag, examining his longsword to see if it needs sharpening, a low hum of a tune emanating from the back of his throat.\n\nCare to explain?\n(Sometimes ‘voices’ are overheard.) You feel the mental equivalent of a shrug.\nBut whose voice was that? Mine or yours?\n(The man didn’t seem to hear anyone besides his loyal sidekick.)\n\nFrustrating. You’re sure to make the voice more talkative after battle. You log all your questions for another time, a time when the black blade is wet with blood. It’s tight-lipped now, keeping secrets of its own. But after slaying several men, it’ll sing at the tops of its lungs, mostly figuratively speaking, of course. Many questions you still have, and not enough answers to keep up with them all. But still, the mission takes precedence.\n\nThe mission is what matters, otherwise all those who stood in your way were removed for nothing, some, like Prinn, never to move again. Your reputation in Alteran, not to mention Magda, is ruined, at least when it comes to the chain of command. Rules, laws, regulations would put the noose around your neck without blinking an eye. To the common man, each individual link in the chain, you might find understanding for your actions. Empathy. Perhaps even an ally or two. You have found allies, and they’re continuing to grow. The High King may love his chain of command; let’s see how much he likes it when you pluck specific rings to your cause.\n\n“Come, our contact awaits. The Blackbirds close in,” Redding says.\n\nYou finish the remainder of the coffee and snuff the fire. You answer in a voice not entirely yours.\n\n(“Good. My legs are cramped from all of this sitting.”)\n",
  "page 22": "Later, you find the big man standing behind the helmsman, overshadowing, like another mast to the ship. The wheel isn’t handled by Admiral Conway, even though she holds the rank to do so. In fact, you haven\u0027t seen her take command of the vessel the entire journey. Delegation of responsibility, another useful skill in service of the High King. Controlling the entire galleon seems like it would be fun, but maybe it’s all romanticized. Due to its size, it\u0027s not like the ship can switch directions quickly. Commanding one of the smaller ships, one of the accompanying schooners, would be much more enjoyable. The helmsman doesn’t appear to be having fun, most likely due to the giant standing over him.\n\n“Any ships on the horizon?” Bastus asks.\n\n“No,” the helmsman flatly answers, obviously annoyed at Bastus’ presence.\n\n\"You sure about that?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Because there were some earlier.”\n\nThe helmsman finally turns towards Bastus. “Listen, everything’s handled. Don’t you have a card game to get back to?”\n\nBastus laughs, a deep roar belted from underneath his lengthy beard. “Look-y here,” he comments as he notices your approach. “The stones on this one. Funny how sailors can only grow a pair on the water.”\n\nYou nod towards the helmsman, signaling he’s got nothing to worry about. Bastus’ questioning is bad enough without a partner-in-crime. “You seen Redding anywhere?”\n\nBastus shakes his head. “He’s not up here. There aren’t many places to hide on this boat.” A fact that agrees whole-heartily with the sailor manning the helm. “What did you need?”\n\n“Strategy,” you answer. “The voyage is nearing its end. I know little of the enemy that awaits us in the New World. I’ve heard the reports. They border on ale room rumors. ‘Blackbirds,’ they’re called, the savages that inhabit the land. Their way of life is primitive. Only the strongest survive, and that\u0027s why they boast strength and size far greater than our own.”\n\nBastus’ face falls, at least that which manages to show through his beard. He’s used to being the one spoken of in that light. You continue.\n\n“And yet I can’t shake those posters from my mind. You know, the ones stating fortune can be found in the New World. I certainly haven’t witnessed any of my fellow soldiers returning with bags of gold, have you?”\n\n“Don’t forget about the colonies,” Bastus points out. “The wealth may be being spent in expansion.” Although he looks like a typical brute, Bastus is smarter than he looks. It makes you wonder if he tells crass jokes to hide his intelligence, masking it until use for the greatest reveal and effect. The helmsman, for instance, is unsuspecting of such mental ability.\n\n“Fair point,” you concede. “Tell me you have not held the same thoughts.”\n\nWith a sigh, Bastus responds. “The High King rules, and we soldiers fight. It’s the way of the world, both New and Old. Whether one enlists to bring glory to the High King or advance his personal pursuit, the outcome is the same. We’re crossing the sea to fight the High King’s enemies. The path is set. There’s no changing course.”\n\nThat’s it. His viewpoint set, there’s no need to further the conversation. After all, if things are what they are, according to Bastus, then speculation is useless. You tell Bastus you’re going to continue looking for Corporal Redding. He’ll certainly have more to say on the matter. As you leave, you catch the annoyed face of the helmsman as Bastus refocuses his energy entirely on the sailor.\n",
  "page 21": "Despite your trash talk, you didn’t fare well in the card game. It wasn\u0027t even close. Thinking back on the hands dealt, there wasn’t a single one that you would have won, bluffing and bets aside. Each player has the same odds of receiving a winning hand, often the case for games of chance, but not a single was dealt your way. If the reason you shared with Redding earlier still applies, it seems you’ve got plenty of “luck” left for staying alive. Either that, or you never had any to begin with. You decide to go with the former.\n\nAnother day. Another endless stretch of blue water before you. Blue water, blue sky, brown deck. The view, magnificently beautiful at first, is starting to wear on you. Each day is the same. Some men enjoy not having responsibility to fill their time. Not you. You\u0027ve always found it best to keep your hands busy, preferring work over extended amounts of leisure. That’s part of the reason you enlisted in the first place, among other things…\n\nWhile the others continue their lounging, you do the first work-related thing that pops into your mind: cleaning your flintlock. The others are still sleeping, so you use their card “table,” really just a barrel with small stools around it. You place your flintlock on top. It’s not flashy by any means, especially compared to the pieces the Royal Guard carries. Theirs is more jewelry than weapon, although that\u0027s not an opinion to voice out loud. One doesn’t make it into the Royal Guard by their fashion accessories.\n\nWith the High King’s emphasis on appearance and decorum, it’s a bit surprising the standard issued flintlock isn’t more extravagant. Maybe it’s because the common person can’t tell the difference. Maybe it\u0027s because above all else—even appearances—the High King is focused on winning battles. You examine the flint. Shaped well, held firmly in place by a piece of darkened leather. Maintenance always begins with the flint itself. Unless a spark is made, it’s nothing but a dull club. By the time you\u0027ve dusted off the trigger and cleaned the barrel, your fellow soldiers are starting to wake. Expecting ridicule, you\u0027re pleasantly surprised as two others wordlessly join you, taking seats as if opposing card players. Bastus and Lionel, contrasting demeanors. One man is brazen and charges head first into the fray, while the other prefers to use his head before committing the body to action. The High King\u0027s army demands all types of men.\n\nWhere do you fit in?\n\nThat’s the goddamn question of the century, isn’t it? It’s no secret that Corporal Redding holds you in high regard. Out of all in your squad, he\u0027s opinion is worth the greatest, although in the grand scheme of things it might as well be that of a recruit. Redding is in charge of 12 men, sure, but the High King’s army spans hundreds of thousands. Even Captain Briggs is low on that totem pole.\n\nYour chest may not be decorated with ribbons or accolades, but your actions seem to have direct influence on the soldiers around you. For now, that manifests itself in a positive light: weapon maintenance. The thought appears in your mind, what if you had chosen a self-destructive activity? Would the others join you then? A small chuckle escapes your lips, causing Bastus and Lionel to briefly glance up from their work. You\u0027ve been engaging in that sort of activity the entire voyage, aggressively attacking the Devastator’s ale stores.\n\nDrinking, gambling, it might as well be in the job description for a soldier. As quickly as your introspective thought streams flow, they dry up, leaving your mind to focus on the standard issue flintlock pistol.\n",
  "page 24": "“Land ho!”\n\nThe two words you\u0027ve wanted to hear most finally ring through the air. It’s mid-morning, the sun almost reaching the highest point in the sky of clouds, matching the fog floating near sea level. The air is cold. The temperature has been consistently dropping each day, or at least that\u0027s what it feels like. The days themselves have melded together without a steady routine, forced to stay within the same hunk of lumber. Leave the ships to the sailors. You prefer dry land. Anything for the High King, right? Right.\n\nAdmiral Conway starts barking orders and, in response, her sailors rush to perform the tasks assigned. Captain Briggs does the same, giving instruction to the officers underneath his command, Redding being one of them. Military discipline takes over. The card game is abandoned. Cups of ale tossed overboard. Uniforms buttoned from belly to neck.\n\nHowever undisciplined a soldier in the High King’s army is on his own time doesn\u0027t affect his service when on duty. Countless hours drilling and training takes over. The twelve of you, under Corporeal Redding\u0027s leadership, line up on the Devastator\u0027s deck, three rows of four. Each man knows their place. Second row, left edge is yours. Soon, the entire deck is covered with formation, the soldiers doing their best to remain still during the steady rocking of the waves.\n\nIt appears off in the distance. A large shadow looming ahead. As the fleet sails closer, the fog parts a bit, like the opening of a curtain, revealing the land mass behind it. Its lush green looks black at first, dark color in contrast to the white fog it hides behind. The New World is a place full of life, full of opportunity. Soon, like the Old, it will be tamed, domesticated by the High King. Until then, you’ll have to traverse the rugged overgrowth.\n\n“Steady, men. Follow your commands,” Corporeal Redding states as he paces in front of the formation, hands clasped behind him. “Beach landing. Then RV at Frontrunner’s Camp. That’s all you need to remember.”\n\nA large wave crashes into the galleon, causing a riptide effect on the deck. Soldiers near the impact stagger, regain balance, then resume their stoic positions, the same motion repeated across the deck. The galleons, with their heavily armed escorts, press on.\n\nYour destination is unlike the stories suggest. The stories promised wealth and adventure. They seemed to suggest fortune is at your fingertips, if you could just reach out and grasp it, leaving enough for the High King, of course. Instead, darkness awaits. Each listener knows the stories to be some measure of hyperbole, but the land mass suggests an entirely different narrative was shared. No clear rivers await. No finely-trimmed fruit trees. Just rampant overgrowth, like the fog, hiding more secrets within.\n\nIt is not your place to question. You imagine the same thought is running through your fellow soldiers. Probably for the officers, too, although they suppress it with strength of voice and confidence in command. The High King points and we march. He provides for us, and we bring him the means to support an entire nation. Questioning soldiers are cracks in armor. They\u0027re a sword crafted from impure steel. Their duty is to serve. Leave the decision-making to the superiors.\n\nCaptain Briggs takes center stage as you close in to land. He stands next to Admiral Conway at the helm, who has finally taken the wheel of the Devastator herself, something she was content to have others do the entire voyage. As with your send-off from Alteran, protocol calls for a good old-fashioned speech.\n\n“Soldiers of the High King! Glory is ours for the taking. There is a New World to bring under the High King’s rule. At long last we’ve finally arrived. Untamed land and savage natives await. ‘Blackbirds,’ they\u0027re called, more beast than man. Not only does the land itself bring threat, so does our enemy!”\n\nAround you, the more outwardly loyal soldiers spit on the deck. They know who Captain Briggs is talking about. Fargrave, Supreme Leader of Magda, the second most powerful man in the Old World, next to the High King himself.\n\n“Following our glorious leader’s action, Fargrave (spoken with distaste, intentionally leaving out Supreme Leader) has funded voyages to the New World as well. The jealousy of Magda is apparent. Their inability to think for themselves is well-known. Not only is it imperative we capture wealth and resources for the High King, it is equally as important to deny it to Fargrave.”\n\nMore globs of spit hit the deck.\n\n“You know your orders. We march to Frontrunner’s Camp. You’ve had plenty of time to rest your legs and polish your boots. The camp is a three day journey inland. I expect us to make good time. There is an entire world to discover! Together, we will--”\n\nYour vision ignites in a burst of flame. The previously gray, cloudy setting around you suddenly flashes in the red-orange light of fire. Next to the Devastator, an escort schooner steadily makes her way underneath crashing waves, leaving behind a trail of black smoke, the center of her deck boasting a crater, its edges still burning. Fireball. Much larger than the average wizard’s, like the size of a siege engine’s projectile.\n\n“Brace yourselves!” a voice cries out.\n\nAnother blast of fire hits a transport galleon, thankfully not your own. Soldiers on the deck are thrown from their neatly-organized formations. Upon recovery, they look unsure whether to return back to formation or look for cover.\n\nThe sun peers through the clouds, burning away the gray world around you. It grows bright, far too bright. You glance upward and breath escapes you for a moment. The sun hasn’t appeared. Rather, the sky above is filled with burning flame. Gradually it rises, reaching its highest point in the sky, a slow climb, then crashes down in a fraction of the time.\n\n“Take us in now. Go, go, go!” Captain Briggs shouts from his post. Next to him, Conway spins the wheel, shouting commands to her sailors. Behind her, a communications officer signals the rest of the fleet by flag. Globs of fire rain down upon you, like spit hitting the deck, as the fleet takes you as close as it dares. Wind rushes by your face as you host the same inner debate as the soldiers aboard the galleon hit. Your eyes scan the quickly approaching land mass, searching for an origin of the attack. You find nothing, until the slightest moment catches your attention.\n\n“Fire back or be damned with the rest of us!” Conway yells from the helm. Her eyes land upon the same movement that yours did moments earlier. Sailors cheer their acknowledgement and ready their cannons.\n\nUp on the land mass, high above sea level, you see many small figures, their dark form melding with the overgrown forest. The source of the attack, and the admiral knows it. One hand on the wheel, the other as a lever in the air, one she quickly switches to a downward position, signaling the cannons to fire. Explosion. Black smoke. This time, it originates from the fleet, the blasts a deep echo across the ocean water.\n\nAnother impact rocks the speeding galleon, sending those on deck sprawling. “Soldier!” a familiar voice carries through the noise. You look up to find Corporal Redding standing, his hand firmly gripped around rope tied to the Devastator\u0027s mast. He offers a gloved hand out, which you quickly take, allowing the corporal to pull you to your feet. His hand is then exchanged for rope, bound to the mast like the squeeze of a large snake. More blasts of fire. This time you remain standing.\n\nThe fleet sails forward at full speed. The goal is clear. Your large transport galleons must dock in order for their soldiers to have any effectiveness. Though they are fearsome warships, their current designation is nothing but a glorified transport. Their escorts, however, weave through, nimble, sailing circles around the transports, firing their broadsides with each passing, always in motion, readying their cannons for the next approach. Fire rains from the sky. Wind, sprays of water hit the deck with equal ferocity. Another schooner sinks beneath the waves in an explosion and trail of black smoke.\n\n“Steady yourselves! We’re coming in hot!” Admiral Conway shouts from the helm. She expertly spins the wheel to minimize the inevitable impact.\n\nThe land mass grows larger and larger, like that of an approaching caravan. What was once a small dot on the horizon, now towers high above you. Dark green, almost black, overgrowth awaits, a visible line of contrasts starting at the edge of a sandy beach. No docks. No civilized structures await to safely anchor the fleet. Just sand and sea.\n",
  "page 23": "The bald man sits below deck studying a map. If you didn’t witness his activity—and heavy activity at that—at the gambling table, you would consider Lionel to be the most disciplined soldier out of the twelve. You figure the others would name you as such, although that mostly stems from your tendency to be alone. The High King must truly be proud of his army when the most disciplined are those who drink and gamble to a lesser degree than most.\n\nHe sits cross-legged, back against the wooden side of the ship, map sprawled out before him. It’s not a high quality piece, colored with differing shades of oily yellow. It depicts Alteran, the High King’s land, and fades into nonexistence where the New World begins, but not before listing the one location that you\u0027re familiar with: Frontrunner’s Camp. It\u0027s become somewhat of a small city now, however it still holds the same established name from when it was nothing but scattered makeshift tents and a stick in the ground to tie horses to. The first colony claimed by the High King, every soldier knows of Frontrunner’s.\n\nNot looking up from his studies, Lionel says, “We\u0027re almost there. Judging by the time spent at sea, and the distance to the New World, we’re a matter of days out.”\n\n\"You know there\u0027s a sailor aboard whose job is to figure that out,” you comment.\n\n“Bah, sailors. Second-class soldiers. They enlist in the navy because true battle scares them. Glorified wagon drivers, if you ask me.\"\n\nEyes still on the map, specifically the section that fades into nothingness, you say, \"Is this the most recent edition? I had thought more was discovered beyond Frontrunner’s.”\n\n“There has been,” Lionel responds. “But they have not been approved to be official as of yet. I’m sure there are copies floating around in Frontrunner’s, unofficially, if you are that interested.”\n\n“No need for one as long as the command has it. They’ll direct us, and we’ll go. Knowing the territory doesn’t change much.”\n\n“Spoken like a true soldier.”\n\nLionel’s words rub you the wrong way, not for the first time either. It\u0027s nothing against the man himself. Put two people in close proximity for a while and they’re bound to find a way to get on each other’s nerves. His words indicate mindlessness on your part, whether on purpose or not, it’s received the wrong way.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why you’re unmarried, or at least that’s part of the story. In your experience, the allure and attractiveness of being with a uniform, from the woman’s perspective of course, wears off quickly. Generally it just takes a few nights. Once that’s done, she\u0027s left wanting and you can’t provide. The present situation with Lionel is different, obviously.\n\n“There\u0027s not much else for us to do,” you answer. “You know as well as I that the High King values obedience and the chain of command. Let’s say I knew of a better strategy than my immediate superior. If he\u0027s not willing to listen to me, then there’s no use in sharing it. Gods know I’d never step outside of the chain.”\n\n“Even if stepping out saved more lives of the men?” Lionel questions in a calm tone, unlike the rising volume of your voice.\n\n“Even if. Each one of us knew the risk when enlisting. That’s a possibility when joining the High King’s military. Why should I put myself in harm’s way to prevent an outcome that sure as hell didn\u0027t stop the men from signing up in the first place, an action that I am certain no one else would do for me. We soldiers follow orders. Simple as that. Rank and command can\u0027t afford to be undermined. Men die. Mistakes are made. That’s just how the world is.”\n\nLionel is quiet for a second. Then he responds, eyes never looking up at you. “Interesting. And here I thought you were one of those ‘by any means necessary’ men. Achieve the goal ‘by any means necessary.’ Strive forward ‘by any means necessary.’”\n\nThe final one hits home.\n\n“Save lives ‘by any means necessary.’”\n\nYou have no desire to keep arguing with the man. You cut the dialogue short, something you probably should have done a few moments earlier. “Well, you\u0027ve been wrong before, and you\u0027ll be wrong again. Glory to the High King.”\n\nYou leave before Lionel can respond, not that it would matter. No Alteran citizen would dare to not return the statement. A perfect way to end any conversation. Gods, that man can be frustrating sometimes.\n",

As with your send-off from Alteran, protocol calls for a good old-fashioned speech.\n\n“Soldiers of the High King! Glory is ours for the taking. There is a New World to bring under the High King’s rule. At long last we’ve finally arrived. Untamed land and savage natives await. ‘Blackbirds,’ they\u0027re called, more beast than man. Not only does the land itself bring threat, so does our enemy!”\n\nAround you, the more outwardly loyal soldiers spit on the deck. They know who Captain Briggs is talking about. Fargrave, Supreme Leader of Magda, the second most powerful man in the Old World, next to the High King himself.\n\n“Following our glorious leader’s action, Fargrave (spoken with distaste, intentionally leaving out Supreme Leader) has funded voyages to the New World as well. The jealousy of Magda is apparent. Their inability to think for themselves is well-known. Not only is it imperative we capture wealth and resources for the High King, it is equally as important to deny it to Fargrave.”\n\nMore globs of spit hit the deck.\n\n“You know your orders. We march to Frontrunner’s Camp. You’ve had plenty of time to rest your legs and polish your boots. The camp is a three day journey inland. I expect us to make good time. There is an entire world to discover! Together, we will--”\n\nYour vision ignites in a burst of flame. The previously gray, cloudy setting around you suddenly flashes in the red-orange light of fire. Next to the Devastator, an escort schooner steadily makes her way underneath crashing waves, leaving behind a trail of black smoke, the center of her deck boasting a crater, its edges still burning. Fireball. Much larger than the average wizard’s, like the size of a siege engine’s projectile.\n\n“Brace yourselves!” a voice cries out.\n\nAnother blast of fire hits a transport galleon, thankfully not your own. Soldiers on the deck are thrown from their neatly-organized formations. Upon recovery, they look unsure whether to return back to formation or look for cover.\n\nThe sun peers through the clouds, burning away the gray world around you. It grows bright, far too bright. You glance upward and breath escapes you for a moment. The sun hasn’t appeared. Rather, the sky above is filled with burning flame. Gradually it rises, reaching its highest point in the sky, a slow climb, then crashes down in a fraction of the time.\n\n“Take us in now. Go, go, go!” Captain Briggs shouts from his post. Next to him, Conway spins the wheel, shouting commands to her sailors. Behind her, a communications officer signals the rest of the fleet by flag. Globs of fire rain down upon you, like spit hitting the deck, as the fleet takes you as close as it dares. Wind rushes by your face as you host the same inner debate as the soldiers aboard the galleon hit. Your eyes scan the quickly approaching land mass, searching for an origin of the attack. You find nothing, until the slightest moment catches your attention.\n\n“Fire back or be damned with the rest of us!” Conway yells from the helm. Her eyes land upon the same movement that yours did moments earlier. Sailors cheer their acknowledgement and ready their cannons.\n\nUp on the land mass, high above sea level, you see many small figures, their dark form melding with the overgrown forest. The source of the attack, and the admiral knows it. One hand on the wheel, the other as a lever in the air, one she quickly switches to a downward position, signaling the cannons to fire. Explosion. Black smoke. This time, it originates from the fleet, the blasts a deep echo across the ocean water.\n\nAnother impact rocks the speeding galleon, sending those on deck sprawling. “Soldier!” a familiar voice carries through the noise. You look up to find Corporal Redding standing, his hand firmly gripped around rope tied to the Devastator\u0027s mast. He offers a gloved hand out, which you quickly take, allowing the corporal to pull you to your feet. His hand is then exchanged for rope, bound to the mast like the squeeze of a large snake. More blasts of fire. This time you remain standing.\n\nThe fleet sails forward at full speed. The goal is clear. Your large transport galleons must dock in order for their soldiers to have any effectiveness. Though they are fearsome warships, their current designation is nothing but a glorified transport. Their escorts, however, weave through, nimble, sailing circles around the transports, firing their broadsides with each passing, always in motion, readying their cannons for the next approach. Fire rains from the sky. Wind, sprays of water hit the deck with equal ferocity. Another schooner sinks beneath the waves in an explosion and trail of black smoke.\n\n“Steady yourselves! We’re coming in hot!” Admiral Conway shouts from the helm. She expertly spins the wheel to minimize the inevitable impact.\n\nThe land mass grows larger and larger, like that of an approaching caravan. What was once a small dot on the horizon, now towers high above you. Dark green, almost black, overgrowth awaits, a visible line of contrasts starting at the edge of a sandy beach. No docks. No civilized structures await to safely anchor the fleet. Just sand and sea.\n",
  "page 25": "The bald man sits below deck studying a map. If you didn’t witness his activity—and heavy activity at that—at the gambling table, you would consider Lionel to be the most disciplined soldier out of the twelve. You figure the others would name you as such, although that mostly stems from your tendency to be alone. The High King must truly be proud of his army when the most disciplined are those who drink and gamble to a lesser degree than most.\n\nHe sits cross-legged, back against the wooden side of the ship, map sprawled out before him. It’s not a high quality piece, colored with differing shades of oily yellow. It depicts Alteran, the High King’s land, and fades into nonexistence where the New World begins, but not before listing the one location that you\u0027re familiar with: Frontrunner’s Camp. It\u0027s become somewhat of a small city now, however it still holds the same established name from when it was nothing but scattered makeshift tents and a stick in the ground to tie horses to. The first colony claimed by the High King, every soldier knows of Frontrunner’s.\n\nNot looking up from his studies, Lionel says, “We\u0027re almost there. Judging by the time spent at sea, and the distance to the New World, we’re a matter of days out.”\n\n\"You know there\u0027s a sailor aboard whose job is to figure that out,” you comment.\n\n“Bah, sailors. Second-class soldiers. They enlist in the navy because true battle scares them. Glorified wagon drivers, if you ask me.\"\n\nEyes still on the map, specifically the section that fades into nothingness, you say, \"Is this the most recent edition? I had thought more was discovered beyond Frontrunner’s.”\n\n“There has been,” Lionel responds. “But they have not been approved to be official as of yet. I’m sure there are copies floating around in Frontrunner’s, unofficially, if you are that interested.”\n\n“No need for one as long as the command has it. They’ll direct us, and we’ll go. Knowing the territory doesn’t change much.”\n\n“Spoken like a true soldier.”\n\nLionel’s words rub you the wrong way, not for the first time either. It\u0027s nothing against the man himself. Put two people in close proximity for a while and they’re bound to find a way to get on each other’s nerves. His words indicate mindlessness on your part, whether on purpose or not, it’s received the wrong way.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why you’re unmarried, or at least that’s part of the story. In your experience, the allure and attractiveness of being with a uniform, from the woman’s perspective of course, wears off quickly. Generally it just takes a few nights. Once that’s done, she\u0027s left wanting and you can’t provide. The present situation with Lionel is different, obviously.\n\n“There\u0027s not much else for us to do,” you answer. “You know as well as I that the High King values obedience and the chain of command. Let’s say I knew of a better strategy than my immediate superior. If he\u0027s not willing to listen to me, then there’s no use in sharing it. Gods know I’d never step outside of the chain.”\n\n“Even if stepping out saved more lives of the men?” Lionel questions in a calm tone, unlike the rising volume of your voice.\n\n“Even if. Each one of us knew the risk when enlisting. That’s a possibility when joining the High King’s military. Why should I put myself in harm’s way to prevent an outcome that sure as hell didn\u0027t stop the men from signing up in the first place, an action that I am certain no one else would do for me. We soldiers follow orders. Simple as that. Rank and command can\u0027t afford to be undermined. Men die. Mistakes are made. That’s just how the world is.”\n\nLionel is quiet for a second. Then he responds, eyes never looking up at you. “Interesting. And here I thought you were one of those ‘by any means necessary’ men. Achieve the goal ‘by any means necessary.’ Strive forward ‘by any means necessary.’”\n\nThe final one hits home.\n\n“Save lives ‘by any means necessary.’”\n\nYou have no desire to keep arguing with the man. You cut the dialogue short, something you probably should have done a few moments earlier. “Well, you\u0027ve been wrong before, and you\u0027ll be wrong again. Glory to the High King.”\n\nYou leave before Lionel can respond, not that it would matter. No Alteran citizen would dare to not return the statement. A perfect way to end any conversation. Gods, that man can be frustrating sometimes.\n",
  "page 28": "“Land ho!”\n\nThe two words you\u0027ve wanted to hear most finally ring through the air. It’s mid-morning, the sun almost reaching the highest point in the sky of clouds, matching the fog floating near sea level. The air is cold. The temperature has been consistently dropping each day, or at least that\u0027s what it feels like. The days themselves have melded together without a steady routine, forced to stay within the same hunk of lumber. Leave the ships to the sailors. You prefer dry land. Anything for the High King, right? Right.\n\nAdmiral Conway starts barking orders and, in response, her sailors rush to perform the tasks assigned. Captain Briggs does the same, giving instruction to the officers underneath his command, Redding being one of them. Military discipline takes over. The card game is abandoned. Cups of ale tossed overboard. Uniforms buttoned from belly to neck.\n\nHowever undisciplined a soldier in the High King’s army is on his own time doesn\u0027t affect his service when on duty. Countless hours drilling and training takes over. The twelve of you, under Corporeal Redding\u0027s leadership, line up on the Devastator\u0027s deck, three rows of four. Each man knows their place. Second row, left edge is yours. Soon, the entire deck is covered with formation, the soldiers doing their best to remain still during the steady rocking of the waves.\n\nIt appears off in the distance. A large shadow looming ahead. As the fleet sails closer, the fog parts a bit, like the opening of a curtain, revealing the land mass behind it. Its lush green looks black at first, dark color in contrast to the white fog it hides behind. The New World is a place full of life, full of opportunity. Soon, like the Old, it will be tamed, domesticated by the High King. Until then, you’ll have to traverse the rugged overgrowth.\n\n“Steady, men. Follow your commands,” Corporeal Redding states as he paces in front of the formation, hands clasped behind him. “Beach landing. Then RV at Frontrunner’s Camp. That’s all you need to remember.”\n\nA large wave crashes into the galleon, causing a riptide effect on the deck. Soldiers near the impact stagger, regain balance, then resume their stoic positions, the same motion repeated across the deck. The galleons, with their heavily armed escorts, press on.\n\nYour destination is unlike the stories suggest. The stories promised wealth and adventure. They seemed to suggest fortune is at your fingertips, if you could just reach out and grasp it, leaving enough for the High King, of course. Instead, darkness awaits. Each listener knows the stories to be some measure of hyperbole, but the land mass suggests an entirely different narrative was shared. No clear rivers await. No finely-trimmed fruit trees. Just rampant overgrowth, like the fog, hiding more secrets within.\n\nIt is not your place to question. You imagine the same thought is running through your fellow soldiers. Probably for the officers, too, although they suppress it with strength of voice and confidence in command. The High King points and we march. He provides for us, and we bring him the means to support an entire nation. Questioning soldiers are cracks in armor. They\u0027re a sword crafted from impure steel. Their duty is to serve. Leave the decision-making to the superiors.\n\nCaptain Briggs takes center stage as you close in to land. He stands next to Admiral Conway at the helm, who has finally taken the wheel of the Devastator herself, something she was content to have others do the entire voyage.

Not only does the land itself bring threat, so does our enemy!”\n\nAround you, the more outwardly loyal soldiers spit on the deck. They know who Captain Briggs is talking about. Fargrave, Supreme Leader of Magda, the second most powerful man in the Old World, next to the High King himself.\n\n“Following our glorious leader’s action, Fargrave (spoken with distaste, intentionally leaving out Supreme Leader) has funded voyages to the New World as well. The jealousy of Magda is apparent. Their inability to think for themselves is well-known.

No civilized structures await to safely anchor the fleet. Just sand and sea.\n",
  "page 27": "Later, you find the big man standing behind the helmsman, overshadowing, like another mast to the ship. The wheel isn’t handled by Admiral Conway, even though she holds the rank to do so. In fact, you haven\u0027t seen her take command of the vessel the entire journey. Delegation of responsibility, another useful skill in service of the High King. Controlling the entire galleon seems like it would be fun, but maybe it’s all romanticized. Due to its size, it\u0027s not like the ship can switch directions quickly. Commanding one of the smaller ships, one of the accompanying schooners, would be much more enjoyable. The helmsman doesn’t appear to be having fun, most likely due to the giant standing over him.\n\n“Any ships on the horizon?” Bastus asks.\n\n“No,” the helmsman flatly answers, obviously annoyed at Bastus’ presence.\n\n\"You sure about that?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Because there were some earlier.”\n\nThe helmsman finally turns towards Bastus. “Listen, everything’s handled. Don’t you have a card game to get back to?”\n\nBastus laughs, a deep roar belted from underneath his lengthy beard. “Look-y here,” he comments as he notices your approach. “The stones on this one. Funny how sailors can only grow a pair on the water.”\n\nYou nod towards the helmsman, signaling he’s got nothing to worry about. Bastus’ questioning is bad enough without a partner-in-crime. “You seen Redding anywhere?”\n\nBastus shakes his head. “He’s not up here. There aren’t many places to hide on this boat.” A fact that agrees whole-heartily with the sailor manning the helm. “What did you need?”\n\n“Strategy,” you answer. “The voyage is nearing its end. I know little of the enemy that awaits us in the New World. I’ve heard the reports. They border on ale room rumors. ‘Blackbirds,’ they’re called, the savages that inhabit the land. Their way of life is primitive. Only the strongest survive, and that\u0027s why they boast strength and size far greater than our own.”\n\nBastus’ face falls, at least that which manages to show through his beard. He’s used to being the one spoken of in that light. You continue.\n\n“And yet I can’t shake those posters from my mind. You know, the ones stating fortune can be found in the New World. I certainly haven’t witnessed any of my fellow soldiers returning with bags of gold, have you?”\n\n“Don’t forget about the colonies,” Bastus points out. “The wealth may be being spent in expansion.” Although he looks like a typical brute, Bastus is smarter than he looks. It makes you wonder if he tells crass jokes to hide his intelligence, masking it until use for the greatest reveal and effect. The helmsman, for instance, is unsuspecting of such mental ability.\n\n“Fair point,” you concede. “Tell me you have not held the same thoughts.”\n\nWith a sigh, Bastus responds. “The High King rules, and we soldiers fight. It’s the way of the world, both New and Old. Whether one enlists to bring glory to the High King or advance his personal pursuit, the outcome is the same. We’re crossing the sea to fight the High King’s enemies. The path is set. There’s no changing course.”\n\nThat’s it. His viewpoint set, there’s no need to further the conversation. After all, if things are what they are, according to Bastus, then speculation is useless. You tell Bastus you’re going to continue looking for Corporal Redding. He’ll certainly have more to say on the matter. As you leave, you catch the annoyed face of the helmsman as Bastus refocuses his energy entirely on the sailor.\n",
  "page 0": "You! Yes, you. Are you looking for a life of adventure? Do you want your name to live forever in history? Join the High King’s army today, and all that (and more!) could be yours! *the High King is not responsible for any bodily harm or fatalities allegedly caused by this message.\n\nAnother poster on a billboard littered with hundreds of them. The entire wall is covered with similar messages, the High King’s insignia proudly displayed in the middle. It’s a simple insignia for a man who is the most powerful in the world. Your neighbor to the east, Supreme Leader Fargrave, might not agree. Still, it’s your High King who is leading and profiting from expeditions to the New World, not Fargrave and the territory of Magda. Back to the billboard in front of you; another catches your eye. And yes, in the center is an upside down sword with a golden crown at the top.\n\nThe gunslinger’s life is a hard lonely road. The High King offers abundance in both food and comradery! Safety in numbers!\n\nNot the most creative of slogans, or the catchiest, but something’s doing the trick. Your peers are enlisting by the thousands. At this point, it’s easier to remember who hasn’t enlisted rather than who has. And who wouldn’t join? There are countless stories of treasures discovered, battles won, and wealth sent back to families. The town crier wails every night on the High King’s victory in the New World, seeping his message into the very dreams of the citizens of Alteran.\n\nRumors are that the New World is even larger than the Old. The High King’s Alteran and Fargrave’s Magda take up about sixty percent of the landmass of the Old. The rest is littered with various republics and “the people’s blah, blah, blah.” Who even keeps track of those small territories? None present an actual threat in either trade, military power, or--well, that’s all that matters. Give it a hundred years or so and they’ll all belong to either the High King or the Supreme Leader (spit). You’ve never had the best of luck in the gambling den, but you’d put your money on that bet every time.\n\nFools. Some things are just too good to be true. The New World speaks to a man. It whispers tender secrets of possession and satisfaction, lining the message with a good ol’ fashioned appeal to man’s stubbornness. Come to me, it says. Your efforts will be rewarded. It’s a hard life, but the payout is well worth it. Or stay put. Live the rest of your life wondering “What if?” Men with no military experience sign up for the frontlines. For what purpose? To avoid asking themselves that very question. What if?\n\nFools. They can’t think for themselves, needing the High King’s expedition to lead them into a life full of adventure, putting their life in danger for material wealth and prosperity. And you? Heh. You’re the biggest fool of them all. You enlisted before the New World expeditions even began.\n\n“Were you going to join us or do you prefer the company of the billboard?”\n\nYou turn to see Corporal Redding. The man’s scraggly beard, now graying, is stained with ale, the top two buttons of his uniform open. The High King’s military uniform. At times, it looks too proper for the messiness of war. Still, that’s how the High King governs, with a proper chain of command and regal attire. A long sweeping coat accompanies the uniform, reaching nearly to the standard issue knee-high boots. It’s a dark navy color, stitched with golden trim, seven buttons down the front, gold as well.\n\nRedding takes a large gulp of ale as he expectantly awaits your answer.\n",
  "page 33": "The entire battalion is given a few days to recover. Instead of taking the time to rest, you rather explore the camp. It’s your first time here, after all. For all you know it may be your last. Eventual death aside, you would rather be out than sit in a crowded barracks all day, even if your body is screaming for more sleep. Like a traditional military camp, the higher-ranking officers bunk near the center. The farther out you go, the lower-ranking members you see. Following suit, the finer establishments are located near the center since that’s where the wealth is, and the farther out you go...yeah, you’re beginning to understand the layout of the camp, city, whatever the place is.\n\nB-4 is located at a mid-range, if not slightly lower. Not a horrible place to be, but not upscale either. It’s all relative anyway. You’re sure those at the edge view you similarly to the center-dwelling folks, the inverse no doubt happening. That stuff has never really bothered you. Comfort has a way of corrupting a man’s resolve. You’d rather have your principles intact than money in your pocket. Of course, that’s the mindset of a man who’s never truly had his pockets empty.\n\nYou find yourself on a main street. Not the main street, a main street. With Frontrunner’s Camp built center-out, there’s a circular layout, referred to as Rings. There’s one street called Main street that cuts through the center, but it doesn’t reach the outside edges. It’s left solely for the upper-class to travel. The closer a ring is to the center, the smaller it is. So, there had to be a way of connecting them together, hence Main street. Beyond that, “main street” is simply the largest street that inhabits a ring, circling through an entire set of buildings.\n\nStanding on a main street, you decide to visit…\n",
  "page 32": "Unable to find your company, you await command from Captain Briggs. The rest of the battalion does the same, those finding their fellow squad members organizing themselves into a rough formation. Exhaustion starts to creep in on you. The swim plus trudging around the sand in water-soaked boots takes a considerable amount of energy, especially when the only thing in your belly is a small amount of rations, and of course the morning ale goes unspoken. No, the events since breakfast have certainly been sobering. Awake, alert, and drenched, you await command.\n\nYou don’t have to wait long. Briggs is huddled with the platoon leaders, at least those that aren’t lost to sea. You catch sight of Redding’s unkempt beard among the others. He stands out being the only one without a close shave of both face and head, which would normally bring scrutiny except for his measure of success. As long as you’ve been in the company, there hasn’t been much failure. Whether that is reflecting of Redding’s leadership or the men themselves is up for debate. One thing’s not debatable, however: the man would be quickly replaced if his record was not as well-kept as his colleagues’ grooming.\n\nThe commanding officers break and address their designated sections. Corporal Redding doesn’t head exactly in your direction, so you follow to where he walks. You find the others nearby, only ten still remaining. Two lost in the fiery assault and swim. Large Bastus gives a nod towards you as you approach. The man’s left sleeve is torn, blood soaking down the exposed arm, by the looks of the wound, shrapnel from a fireball explosion. It doesn’t seem to bother him as his lips spread into a wide grin.\n\n“The lone wolf survives. And here I thought your legendary tale was cut premature by a little dip in the sea.”\n\nHis demeanor quickly changes, taking in the present situation. Two lost. It wears heavy on the men. You try to fix his light-hearted outburst, and the effect it has on the others. “Not the landing we expected. Still, at least you’ve gotten your wash for the year.”\n\n“Enough of that,” Corporal Redding interjects. At his voice, you all seem to stand a bit taller. The High King’s soldier isn’t a sloucher, after all. He stands tall and proud, chin and chest raised high. “We’re marching to Frontrunner’s Camp. The battalion has lost a considerable amount of men and arms. Damn Blackbirds.” Corporal Redding spits on the ground, similar to the way a decent man would react to mentioning Supreme Leader Fargrave. “There, we’ll regroup and rearm. And don’t you lazy men worry, there’ll be time for rest, too.”\n\n“How soon until we march on the hills?” Bastus asks, obviously wanting to settle the score with your ambushers.\n\n“I don’t know,” Redding admits, truthfully. He’s never one to withhold from the company. “Half span or maybe a full? I wouldn’t be too hasty if I were you. We’ve only just arrived after a long voyage, and the arrival wasn’t quite what we expected… There will be plenty of time for vengeance. I suggest you rest up, acquaint yourselves with the New World. You’ve all heard the rumors. The New World is supposed to be substantially larger than the Old. There are things here we’ve never experienced. Vengeance lies in the future, yes. But for now, rest is more important.”\n\nDespite his words, rest doesn’t come right away. Officers shout their commands, and you form into lines, first a little scattered. Each soldier steps to his normal spot in the formation, although gaps are apparent from those who’ve fallen in the skirmish. The space is quickly closed, formations becoming tighter, but the damage is done. Along with exhaustion, death hangs heavy in the air, coupled with near half of the battalion being unarmed. Sheathes lie empty, quivers absent of arrows--even the occasional one-boot soldier. The battalion marches toward Frontrunner’s camp, broken and beat.\n\n---\n\nThe journey is supposed to be three days. It takes four. The pace is slow, overgrowth halting progress several times. Exhausted soldiers take turn chopping vines down, clearing the path for the battalion. Similarly at night, shifts are taken to watch against threat. Military tactic states now is the perfect time for a follow-up ambush. The enemy, you, is scattered and lacking firepower. Those still wearing armor is nothing but light leather, only able to protect a surface slash. There’s not protection against arrows or direct piercing, not to mention fireballs. But still, the march is quiet, both from the enemy and among one another.\n\nThere’s no laughter. No triumphant chants or songs toward the High King. Simply, marching. You step one foot in front of the other. You stop when Redding tells you to stop. You start again when he says. Your mind’s gone to auto-functioning, the body reacting to orders while the conscious sleeps. Step, breath, another. Step breath, another.\n\nPerhaps if the arrival was different, you’d be interested in the setting around you. The overgrowth and all that it holds is foreign to you. After a while, unrecognizable plants and sounds stop standing out. At first, the eye and ear instantly drew to each, abandoning all else for the New World’s novelty. That faded after the first day of marching. Now, they all blend together in a mix of confusion, curiosity and excitement gone. Your only concern is stepping one foot in front of the other, breathing in-between.\n\nThe fourth day, just after the sun’s peak, Frontrunner’s Camp appears. It’s nothing like the name suggests, being more city than camp. It’s filled with solid structures. In the New World’s overgrown state, lumber is plentiful, allowing the “camp” to have actual buildings, even if they are only from wood. No doubt they will be reinforced with brick or stone once resources allow. Still, it’s a huge upgrade from a collection of canvas tents. Merchants know it too. Many from Alteran made the voyage as well, seeing the same opportunity in the New World as the High King. That’s where their similarities end, however, as the city is obviously military-driven. From what you can see, at least two-thirds of the people walking the street wear military garb, whether that’s armor, robes, or ceremonial attire. One thing you do notice that’s not military-driven is the wall, or rather, lack thereof. A place such as Frontrunner’s should be reinforced defensively. Instead, it’s just a cluster of wooden structures. After the way the fireballs greeted you, the organization of the city feels wrong. It feels damn wrong.\n\nStill, though, it’s not your place to question things. Your job is to follow orders. They tell you to march, you march. They tell you to rest, you rest. They tell you to put your things down in Barracks Four, you put your things down in Barracks Four. “B-4” isn’t much as far as lodgings go. You get assigned a bunk and a small chest. Calling it a chest gives too much credit. Your sole storage compartment holds as much as a single drawer of dresser, not that you have anything to place in it for now.\n\nYour waterproof pack, property of the High King’s, was returned back for however the High King sees fit, although since arriving to Frontrunner’s it would have just taken up space. There’s not much use for a waterproof traveling pack in the comforts of a city. B-4 itself is just as compact as your storage space, only offering enough bunks for the twelve of you, rather, the ten of you. Two beds rest empty, their assigned inhabitants doing the same at the bottom of the sea.\n",
  "page 35": "Easy decision, huh? Some are harder than others. This one is a no-brainer for a soldier. To be fair, “R\u0026R” is commonly referred to as grabbing a drink. Soldiers in the line of duty tell their immediate officer they need a little R\u0026R, and everyone knows what that means, at least until you reach a certain threshold, captain, the one in this case. It’s an inside joke between infantrymen, but it holds some truth to it. Officers respect it. They understand. Soldiers don’t abuse it. It’s the unspoken agreement between those with an undecorated military career. Captain Briggs ordered you to rest? Hell, you could use some R\u0026R. It’s been a strenuous journey, to say the least.\n\nYou walk down the main street. It’s large enough that the circle format doesn’t feel like one. The angle is slightly enough to notice that you can’t walk in a straight line. But still, it doesn’t feel as if you’re heading across bends. At this point, you’re not picky. You weren’t before departing from Alteran, and you aren’t now that you’ve arrived in the New World. Starting your search, you silently commit to entering the first tavern you come across. You find the Hanging Bridge after a few hundred steps. Either B-4 has a perfect location or there are many taverns in Frontrunner’s. You guess it’s the latter.\n\nLike the buildings surrounding it, along with every other in Frontrunner’s, it’s built from wood. However, the Bridge is a darker shade, giving the tavern a shadowy effect, a place of refuge from the beating sunlight. Only in this case, the sky is cloudy, but still, refuge is most welcoming. You enter through the front door.\n\nInside is similarly dark. The hearth burns a low ember. Various candlesticks are strategically placed in the room, spread out enough so that light is not overwhelming in one area, but still close enough for the edge of their glow to touch each other. The bartender stands behind the bar, a dark wood one of course, polishing it with a rag. His face is shrouded in darkness, although white teeth appear, revealing a smile as you approach.\n\n“Fresh off the boat?” he asks, his voice the sound of grinding two rocks together. You can’t tell if he’s trying to be friendly or make a joke. You suppose it could be both.\n\n“Something like that,” you answer, plopping down onto a bar stool. It’s then that you notice how empty the establishment is. To be fair, it is rather early. “What do you got?”\n\n“What don’t I got? Fine reds from the Alteran Vineyards--imported at great expense, mind you. Brandy from Sars Hillside that will burn the back of your throat and soothe it at the same time. And New World whiskey, distilled myself. A few shots will have a horse stumbling back to the stables.”\n\n“I think you answered your own question,” you respond with a smile.\n\nThe bartender reaches for a bottle, plainly shaped compared to the others. Its label isn’t bright; it doesn’t catch the eye. Its contents are near the bottom, which is telling in itself. Someone enjoys the drink. That’s a good sign, unless the bartender is dipping into his own supply. A small shot glass crashes down hard on the bar top, and the distinct sound of a cork echoes throughout the empty room. The bartender fills the glass almost to its brim, spilling a few drops.\n\n“Interested to hear what you think, soldier,” the bartender says, expectantly.\n\nYour hand grabs the glass. It’s cool to the touch. Smooth. You toss back the drink in a single gulp. The whiskey itself is unlike the glass, and could hardly be classified as smooth. Rough. Scratchy. Rocky. Those are more accurate descriptions. But the flavor is something else. It follows a second after the initial shock, hints of handcrafted oak barrel and, oddly, campfire smoke. It’s both jolting and relaxing at the same time, painful yet comforting.\n\n“Gods above and the malicious devil below. What is this stuff?” you ask, staring into the empty glass.\n\n“My own special blend,” the bartender says. “The New World offers more ingredients than I ever imagined before making the voyage across the sea. It’s a place of wonder and discovery…” The man trails off at the end. You know a cue when you see one.\n\n“And...?”\n\n“...and great danger--as most places where wealth is to be discovered are.”\n\n“What sort of danger?”\n\n“Now, now. That’s confidential information, shared in the sacred oath of silence between bartender and patron. Let’s just say I’m glad to be tending bar, rather than back out in the wilderness.”\n\n“So you were a soldier then,” you conclude.\n\n“Something like that,” the bartender returns your words back.\n\nIt’s silent for a moment. Then an idea pops into your head. “I’d like to try the brandy after all.” As the bartender reaches for a bottle unseen underneath the bar, you stop him. “No, not the Sars. That one.” you point to one behind him, near to the floor.” He nods and reaches for the bottle. He tries to hide it, but you see it clearly now that you’re searching. One leg, too stiff to be natural, unable to bend at the knee. A prosthetic, and one unenchanted by his movement. It might as well be a peg leg. You’re willing to bet it’s the same dark wood that the tavern is built from.\n\nThe bartender pours you another glass. You raise it up. “To the cruel mistress we call fate and the ‘blessings’ she showers upon us.”\n\n“I’ll drink to that,” the bartender says, grabbing a glass for himself. You clink them together and toss back the brandy.\n",
  "page 37": "It’s been a long voyage and march to Frontrunner’s. You know by experience that muscle soreness will settle in if you don’t spend time in movement. Despite your mind’s desire, you decide to visit one of the training rooms. Large scale drills require a good deal of logistic effort. You’re simply planning to get a few swings in with a practice dummy, perhaps a few shots of your flintlock if there’s a range.\n\nYou walk down the main street of the Ring, passing by more than a few taverns and brothels. You almost change your mind and visit one. But then memory creeps in, recollection of tight muscles and stiff joints during battle--along with the enemy, you’re fighting your own body for proper movement. Life may not be perfect, but you sure as hell aren’t looking for a premature death.\n\nEventually you come across a building with the High King’s sigil on it: a crown atop an upside-down sword. It’s framed by two more swords, their edges in contact with one another signaling a place of combat. You take the steps to the front door. Inside, an open room greets you. Training dummies line the far side wall, their arms holding a practice sword and small buckler. The ground is dirt, something that would never pass for a training room in Alteran. No, the rooms, much like the soldiers themselves, are to be kept clean and pristine.\n\nBesides the floor catching your eye, another detail is a close second. It’s empty. Not a soul is present. There is no instructor shouting commands in a gruff voice, insulting poor technique with ease. No devoted soldier looking to get extra time in. There’s not even a bored-looking soldier meant to keep an eye on things. It’s just you, the dirt, and the dummies welcoming you in as one of their own. If they want it, you’ll give it.\n\nYou remove your longsword from its sheath, running from right shoulder to left hip. Most would abandon the sheath along with the sword itself, but an old combat mentor taught you to train with it present. What? You gonna fight without it on your back too? The answer’s no in most cases, and plus, it will only help you move with greater ease when the sheath doesn’t rest on your back. Win-win. It was a hindrance at first, but now it’s normal, like training with heavy armor on.\n\nYou begin to flow through the forms of sword mastery, starting with small basic movements, keeping strong and steady footwork. The feet are the base, the foundation of every position. If you skimp on the foundation, then the entire structure collapses. It may not be the most exciting thing--it’s definitely not the most flashy--but it’s by far the most important. Sword dancing may make for a fine show for drunk patrons at the local tavern; a real fighter knows it has little place for actual combat. Besides exhausting great amounts of energy, it only directly applies to single-opponent skirmishes. On a real battlefield, sword technique must be efficient. It must be deliberate. It must be deadly.\n\nYou lose yourself to the moment and to the forms, the flow state.\n\nThe technique reigns supreme.\n\nYou are simply the conduit.\n",
  "page 36": "It’s not the most respective of places, but a man’s got certain urges that are best attended to rather than left pent-up. You walk down the main street of the Ring, familiarizing yourself with the area near B-4. You pass by one tavern, then another, and another: seems you’ve discovered the Camp’s favorite pastime. The place you\u0027re destined is likely a close second. Soldiers need to entertain themselves somehow, blow off steam. A drink, a lay are both two good options. And like many good things, they go hand-in-hand.\n\nMost of those you pass by on the street are wearing a military uniform close to yours. Theirs, however, show signs of use, threaded edges, dirt on their boots. It wouldn’t last a second in the streets of Alteran. In the New World, the regulations are apparently a little more lax. The fact that your uniform is brand-spanking-new is a dead giveaway to your recent arrival. Sure, it wasn’t a clean departure from the fleet, even more so on the march to Frontrunner’s. But still, you’re left with a more pristine overcoat than anyone you’ve run into.\n\nEventually, you run into a sign.\n\nTRIBADAS.\n\nYou’re not certain if that’s a name or a word in another language, but the crowd of women standing outside in low-V corsets and skirts is telling in itself. That’s a sign you can understand in any language. You give the group of women a nod as you step towards the front door. The inside is filled with small magical lamps. They glow a deep crimson, shading the room’s entirety in dark red and shadowy black. Not two steps in, a woman grabs hold of your arm.\n\n“Fresh off the boat?” she comments with a voice spun from golden thread.\n\nYours in return is a little less delicate, rough around the edges. “Something like that. Fresh from a good swim is more accurate.”\n\nShe laughs. The movement causes a movement at her lower neck. She sure as hell caught you looking, too. “I heard about that. Not the most elegant of landings. But you made it here. That’s what’s important.”\n\nYou get a better look at the woman. Her hair is dark. You can’t tell whether it’s actually red or a deep brown because of the lamplight. Her skin is pale. Contrasting with the dim light, it stands out, and she’s more than willing to show an ample amount.\n\n“News travels fast around here,” you say. “We’ve only just arrived.”\n\n“Yes,” the woman answers as if she knows something you don’t. “I could tell by your pressed uni. Give it time, hon. You’ll blend in with your fellows soon enough.”\n\n“And if I don’t mind standing out?”\n\nAnother laugh. “Then you better get a second job as a wash-woman.”\n\nIt’s quiet for a moment. Then the woman speaks again. “I’m Madeline.”\n\nYou start to give your own, but she cuts you off.\n\n“I don’t want to hear your real one. Sorry. It’s better off that way. No doubt after I take you upstairs, you’ll be singing secrets as if you were a traveling bard at a roadside tavern. I’ve got tight lips, but that’s not the case for all the girls. I’d hate for anything to come back to haunt you.”\n\nAn honest whore. A High King’s New World.\n\n“And what makes you think that I was going to give my real name?” you question. “Do I look that naive? Perhaps I was going to give a fake one all along. Now, you put me in an interesting position.”\n\n“Which is?”\n\n“Now you assume whatever name I give you will be fake. I could use my real one, and you’d think me false.”\n\n“Not when you tell me it could be your real one, like you did just now.”\n\n“Ahh,” you utter in agreement, like the way a teacher would speak during a lecture. “But now you can’t be certain. A little seed of doubt has been planted. And just like a cloud of pure mystery hangs over me. ‘Who is this mysterious man who just arrived? I don’t know, but I’d certainly like to take him to bed and learn his secrets.’”\n\nMadeline is lost for words. She quickly recovers. “Of all the attempts to get a free lay…”\n\nYou shrug.\n\n“Alright then, ‘Mysterious Man.’ Tell me your name and I’ll take you upstairs.”\n\n“Redding. Corporal Redding.”\n\nA wide smile appears on Madeline’s face. “Nice try. The real corporal has already visited.”\n\nThe look of surprise on your face must be apparent. Madeline laughs, a sweet tone like a composer’s quill pen dipped in honey.\n\n“And he told me to keep an eye out for a clever man under his command. One that thinks himself too smart for his own good. He left a few coins expecting your visit. Shall we?”\n\nShe grabs your hand. Hers is soft, like the comfort of a hearth coming in from the rain. She leads you towards a lone staircase. Despite the bodily pleasure about to take place, your mind wanders to Redding. You silently wonder if you were to visit the next brothel, would there already be coin in place for you? LIkely. There’s no way the corporal guessed the very brothel you would visit. Perhaps you should visit another later. Now, you’re in good company.\n",
  "page 39": "A few days later the company is called upon. Given ample rest time, which you gladly made the most of, your commanders now expect contribution, and after a few days with no orders, the company is ready to give it. At the start of the voyage from Alteran, the soldiers were content to sit idle, drink, gamble, and sleep the day away. After many weeks of it, along with the landing, you’re ready for action. There’s a major difference between a soldier who’s trained for battle versus a soldier longing for it: the company is both, and desperately wants to bring the fight to the Blackbirds. Passion fueling training, a man’s heart aligned with the command of his officer; that, is a scary enemy to face.

Glory for the High King, glory to your lineage.”\n\nNot the most inspiring as far as speeches go, but Redding holds an unconventional style that speaks to a man. Genuine. One man to another, rather than top-down. Lionel speaks up. Straight to the point, as always.\n\n“Orders, sir?”\n\n“We’ve got something of a special assignment,” Redding answers.\n\nBastus cuts him off before he can continue, perhaps a result of Redding not leveraging rank, not that he ever seems to mind. “Special? So we won’t be marching on the Blackbirds that assaulted us?”\n\n“Not directly,” the corporal says. “We’ve noted their location for the Frontrunner scouts. Those who have settled into their tour are better suited to march to combat. This goes above Captain Briggs, even. Rest assured, they will be dealt with.”\n\nSilence hangs over the men, each likely thinking they would be involved in the High King’s retribution. Two members were lost in the landing. Promises were made. Revenge was to be yours. Seems command has another idea, however.\n\n“Our orders, then. Sir,” you keep the conversation going.\n\n“Run-of-the-mill patrol,” Redding speaks, pulling a piece of string from his tunic. Satisfied at its removal, he continues. “There’s a set of ruins northwest of Frontrunner’s. Command hasn’t been able to spare enough soldiers to explore the area. That’s where we come in.”\n\n“Patrol? No combat?” Bastus asks, the shoulders of the large man seemingly slumping with his rhetorical question.\n\n“No hostiles anticipated, no. You know as well as I that there’s always the possibility.”\n\n“What’s so special about these ruins?” you ask.\n\nCorporal Redding looks right at you with his response. “It’s some sort of fallen temple, a holy place once used by the natives here.”\n\n“And what’s so special?” you ask, again.\n\n“You mean that an order from an officer in the High King’s military isn’t special enough for you?” Redding lets his words sink in for a second, a grin appearing at the edge of his lips. “Ok, here’s added background detail, so you can bring greater glory to the High King, of course. The fact is, our wizards, scholars, and tacticians haven’t been able to figure out the source of the Blackbird power. The current hypothesis is that it lies with their religion. If we can learn something from their beliefs, then it may help with nullifying their power.”\n\n“You mean besides the fact that they stand a full head taller than the largest Alteran,” Lionel points out.\n\n“Speak for yourself, little man,” Bastus instantly retorts.\n\nRedding waves a hand to silence the two before the conversation deteriorates into bickering. “Have you already forgotten our landing? The natives, the Blackbirds are crude in their technology. And still, they were able to sink our ships. It doesn’t matter if they stand two feet from the ground if their magic allows for the destruction of ships. We may not be engaging those who stole the lives of our two brothers, but we could very well discover the secret that will collapse their entire military might.”\n\nYou take the opportunity to sum up. “So we’re to patrol a set of ruins, ones that may hold the secret to an ancient power of a New World, into uncharted territory, while it’s uncertain whether traps or enemies lie in wait, ready to ambush us?”\n\n“When you put it that way, it does sound like a rather important assignment,” Bastus comments.\n\n“Agreed,” Lionel can’t help but say, a murmurous echo from the rest of the company.\n\nCorporal Redding simply holds his grin.\n",

  "page 31": "Unable to find your company, you await command from Captain Briggs. The rest of the battalion does the same, those finding their fellow squad members organizing themselves into a rough formation. Exhaustion starts to creep in on you. The swim plus trudging around the sand in water-soaked boots takes a considerable amount of energy, especially when the only thing in your belly is a small amount of rations, and of course the morning ale goes unspoken. No, the events since breakfast have certainly been sobering. Awake, alert, and drenched, you await command.\n\nYou don’t have to wait long. Briggs is huddled with the platoon leaders, at least those that aren’t lost to sea. You catch sight of Redding’s unkempt beard among the others. He stands out being the only one without a close shave of both face and head, which would normally bring scrutiny except for his measure of success. As long as you’ve been in the company, there hasn’t been much failure. Whether that is reflecting of Redding’s leadership or the men themselves is up for debate. One thing’s not debatable, however: the man would be quickly replaced if his record was not as well-kept as his colleagues’ grooming.\n\nThe commanding officers break and address their designated sections. Corporal Redding doesn’t head exactly in your direction, so you follow to where he walks. You find the others nearby, only ten still remaining. Two lost in the fiery assault and swim. Large Bastus gives a nod towards you as you approach. The man’s left sleeve is torn, blood soaking down the exposed arm, by the looks of the wound, shrapnel from a fireball explosion. It doesn’t seem to bother him as his lips spread into a wide grin.\n\n“The lone wolf survives. And here I thought your legendary tale was cut premature by a little dip in the sea.”\n\nHis demeanor quickly changes, taking in the present situation. Two lost. It wears heavy on the men. You try to fix his light-hearted outburst, and the effect it has on the others. “Not the landing we expected. Still, at least you’ve gotten your wash for the year.”\n\n“Enough of that,” Corporal Redding interjects. At his voice, you all seem to stand a bit taller. The High King’s soldier isn’t a sloucher, after all. He stands tall and proud, chin and chest raised high. “We’re marching to Frontrunner’s Camp. The battalion has lost a considerable amount of men and arms. Damn Blackbirds.” Corporal Redding spits on the ground, similar to the way a decent man would react to mentioning Supreme Leader Fargrave. “There, we’ll regroup and rearm. And don’t you lazy men worry, there’ll be time for rest, too.”\n\n“How soon until we march on the hills?” Bastus asks, obviously wanting to settle the score with your ambushers.\n\n“I don’t know,” Redding admits, truthfully. He’s never one to withhold from the company. “Half span or maybe a full? I wouldn’t be too hasty if I were you. We’ve only just arrived after a long voyage, and the arrival wasn’t quite what we expected… There will be plenty of time for vengeance. I suggest you rest up, acquaint yourselves with the New World. You’ve all heard the rumors. The New World is supposed to be substantially larger than the Old. There are things here we’ve never experienced. Vengeance lies in the future, yes. But for now, rest is more important.”\n\nDespite his words, rest doesn’t come right away. Officers shout their commands, and you form into lines, first a little scattered. Each soldier steps to his normal spot in the formation, although gaps are apparent from those who’ve fallen in the skirmish. The space is quickly closed, formations becoming tighter, but the damage is done. Along with exhaustion, death hangs heavy in the air, coupled with near half of the battalion being unarmed. Sheathes lie empty, quivers absent of arrows--even the occasional one-boot soldier. The battalion marches toward Frontrunner’s camp, broken and beat.\n\n---\n\nThe journey is supposed to be three days. It takes four. The pace is slow, overgrowth halting progress several times. Exhausted soldiers take turn chopping vines down, clearing the path for the battalion. Similarly at night, shifts are taken to watch against threat. Military tactic states now is the perfect time for a follow-up ambush. The enemy, you, is scattered and lacking firepower. Those still wearing armor is nothing but light leather, only able to protect a surface slash. There’s not protection against arrows or direct piercing, not to mention fireballs. But still, the march is quiet, both from the enemy and among one another.\n\nThere’s no laughter. No triumphant chants or songs toward the High King. Simply, marching. You step one foot in front of the other. You stop when Redding tells you to stop. You start again when he says. Your mind’s gone to auto-functioning, the body reacting to orders while the conscious sleeps. Step, breath, another. Step breath, another.\n\nPerhaps if the arrival was different, you’d be interested in the setting around you. The overgrowth and all that it holds is foreign to you. After a while, unrecognizable plants and sounds stop standing out. At first, the eye and ear instantly drew to each, abandoning all else for the New World’s novelty. That faded after the first day of marching. Now, they all blend together in a mix of confusion, curiosity and excitement gone. Your only concern is stepping one foot in front of the other, breathing in-between.\n\nThe fourth day, just after the sun’s peak, Frontrunner’s Camp appears. It’s nothing like the name suggests, being more city than camp. It’s filled with solid structures. In the New World’s overgrown state, lumber is plentiful, allowing the “camp” to have actual buildings, even if they are only from wood. No doubt they will be reinforced with brick or stone once resources allow. Still, it’s a huge upgrade from a collection of canvas tents. Merchants know it too. Many from Alteran made the voyage as well, seeing the same opportunity in the New World as the High King. That’s where their similarities end, however, as the city is obviously military-driven. From what you can see, at least two-thirds of the people walking the street wear military garb, whether that’s armor, robes, or ceremonial attire. One thing you do notice that’s not military-driven is the wall, or rather, lack thereof. A place such as Frontrunner’s should be reinforced defensively. Instead, it’s just a cluster of wooden structures. After the way the fireballs greeted you, the organization of the city feels wrong. It feels damn wrong.\n\nStill, though, it’s not your place to question things. Your job is to follow orders. They tell you to march, you march. They tell you to rest, you rest. They tell you to put your things down in Barracks Four, you put your things down in Barracks Four. “B-4” isn’t much as far as lodgings go. You get assigned a bunk and a small chest. Calling it a chest gives too much credit. Your sole storage compartment holds as much as a single drawer of dresser, not that you have anything to place in it for now.\n\nYour waterproof pack, property of the High King’s, was returned back for however the High King sees fit, although since arriving to Frontrunner’s it would have just taken up space. There’s not much use for a waterproof traveling pack in the comforts of a city. B-4 itself is just as compact as your storage space, only offering enough bunks for the twelve of you, rather, the ten of you. Two beds rest empty, their assigned inhabitants doing the same at the bottom of the sea.\n",
  "page 30": "With time before Captain Briggs commands the battalion to move, your immediate concern is with the company. There’s different types of lost. There’s lost in the night without lantern light. There’s lost in the woods, far from the trail without a map or compass to guide you. And finally, there’s a soldier separated from his company lost. The High King’s strict adherence to chain of command leaves the common soldier without the authority to act on his own. What then does a soldier do with no command and the inability to act? Well, pretty much what you’re doing now. You’re damn aware of that fact and pride takes over.\n\nYou decide to look for Corporal Redding first. As the leader of the company, your best chance at finding the others lies with the man. You search through the battalion. Some soldiers remain standing, others taking the chance to rest on the sand. Either way, the beautiful uniforms of the High King are wet, sandy, and anything but regal. The same goes for the men wearing them, including yourself, the reality of conflict that remains unspoken to civilians and politicians. It’s much more inspirational to have a well-dressed army, neatly-groomed, a proper soldier. The number of enlistees might harshly decline if they saw this side, and once you do see this side, it’s much too late to back out. There’s a reason why the enlistee contracted service is more years than the others.\n\nYour fellow soldiers hardly give a second glance as you continue your search. In other circumstances, a few insults and quips would come your way. However, now, each man is much more concerned with survival, checking their equipment, catching their breath, mentally preparing for what comes next. Their gaze is far from the present moment. Yours might be, too, if not for the present task you set for yourself. They stare sightlessly at the sand beneath their feet. It’s not much different for those who do meet eyes; they notice the presence of others, and yet, recognition is absent. Brotherhood isn’t apparent. Battle-shock. Exhaustion.\n\nYou search, and search, and search. Nothing. Not one familiar face is seen. Welcome to the New World, indeed.\n",
  "page 44": "The trek begins late in the morning, unable to start at standard military march time due to the lack of light. The other men in the company take the time to catch up on sleep. The thing is, you’ve had plenty since arriving to Frontrunner’s, enough to recover from the landing. Alone you sit, back rested against the trunk of a tree, the world dark and formless around you. It would be peaceful except for the restlessness that seeps into your being. resting when you should be acting, sleeping when you should be awake, patrolling when you should be fighting. But you’re a soldier, paid to follow orders, not think. The restlessness channels itself into the constant shake of your leg, able to stop when focused upon, but quickly starts its steady rhythm subconsciously.\n\nIt’s quiet. Unlike the forests of Alteran, full of wildlife making themselves known, the forest of the New World is silent, like a predator stalking its prey, a thief in the shadow of an alley. Your thoughts are interrupted by the sudden need to relieve yourself. Like the trees around you, you step without a sound over the sleeping bodies of the others, your coat hanging from your shoulders unbuttoned. You find a lucky tree, one of the varieties with vines wrapped around the trunk as if a serpent. Your trouser buttons soon are in the same state as your coat, the pressure in your bladder slowly subsiding. The silence of the forest is interrupted for a few lengthy seconds by the sound of your stream. You turn to head back to camp--\n\n--and find yourself staring face to face with a woman.\n\nShe’s a native. Despite the first Blackbird you’ve seen up close, your mind is very far from her strange attire, the color of her skin, the shape of her face. Oddly enough, you think of the unbuttoned state you were just seconds ago, your manhood out in the morning air. It’s not the same as being caught with your pants down, but it’s damn near close. You flash a smile, hoping the embarrassment is too apparent on your face.\n\nThe moment passed, you finally get a good look at the woman, noticing that she does not return your smile. She wears a dress of tanned leather, not meant to accentuate her womanly parts--they are doing quite a good job on their own. The woman’s hair is black, like the darkness on a moonless night, loosely tied with a single braid running down the left side of her face. Unfamiliar symbols line her ankles and wrists, black tattoos almost unseen in the low light. She’s unarmed, yet the lean muscle on her sleeveless arms clearly shows that she is not deterred by the fact. You guess she’s a few years older than you.\n\nYour hand tenses in a half reach towards the flintlock at your thigh, like that of a duelist, watching, ready to burst into movement. Your eyes meet the woman’s. Hers are a bright green, a reflection of the canopy overhead. Yours, a deep brown like that of a sturdy trunk.\n\nShe whispers a string of words unfamiliar to you. All that you’ve heard about the Blackbirds never included their language spoken. Perhaps no one has gotten this close before.\n\n“I don’t understand…” you whisper back, motioning your hands and shrugging your shoulders in a way that would be apparent to any Alteran of your meaning.\n\nThe woman’s face is blank; no sign of recognition appears. Although she may have spots of dirt on her, as well as not keeping up with the latest Alteran fashion, she’s undoubtedly beautiful, her skin like that of her dress, tanned, each side of her face a mirror of the other.\n\nShe whispers again. You recognize some of the words, but only because it seems to be the same string as before.\n\n“I don’t understand,” is all you can muster for a response.\n\nThe Blackbird woman stares at you for several seconds, her green eyes steady and focused, her mind searching for a solution. She finds it. Her voice in the common tongue is broken. Simple. Straightforward. Stripped of unnecessary inflection. There’s a strange tone to it. It’s sharp. Direct. Higher pitched as a woman, but yet carrying the strength of a stage performer required to project. Unwavering. All of this you catch in a single word.\n\n“Go.”\n\nBefore you can respond, the Blackbird woman scampers off into the trees. You know better than to chase her. There could be others lying in wait, the woman herself the bait. Even if she’s alone, there\u0027s a risk of becoming lost in the overgrowth, separated from your company without a hope of rescue. No, your mission is to patrol the ruins, not run after local natives through the trees. Still, the meeting itself felt...friendly?\n\nThat’s as best as you can describe it for now. Go. Was that a warning? A threat? A plea? Hard to tell without knowing Blackbird social customs. Being the veteran of many tours, you’re well-aware of different mannerisms that accompany different territories. Meeting the eyes is considered rude in some, while it’s perfectly polite in another. The offering of a left hand is as good as a slap in the face, while it’s the crudest gesture to use the right. That sort of thing. After making the mistake of forcing Alteran custom on your first tours, it’s not a mistake you plan to make again.\n\nYour eyes deeply attuned to the dark, you start to notice the smallest signs of light appearing through the forest canopy. You will be traveling again soon. It would be best to return back to camp. You retrace your steps, a little more carefully this time in the case the Blackbird woman wasn’t alone.\n\nLuckily, you don’t run into any others. As you reenter the camp, the distinct sound of a flintlock click fills the morning air. You raise both hands up defensively instinctively.\n\n“Gods, boy. You can’t go running off like that,” Corporal Redding says as he holsters the weapon.\n\n“Had to find a nice tree to water. Besides, I didn’t want to cause jealousy,” you reply. The joke causes a small chuckle among those standing near.\n\nYou think about sharing the encounter with the Blackbird woman, but you hold off. Now that you’ve had a longer chance to think about it, it seemed more of a warning than a threat. She did not carry any weapons or show aggression. She was alone, meaning she intentionally did not bring warriors with her, not even for protection. Strange that one of them would go out of her way to help. Your first encounter with a Blackbird is not what you expected. For one, you’re both still alive. These thoughts rest on your mind like a word escaping memory recall, a puzzle missing a key piece.\n\nThe company packs their gear, doing their best to hide the camp’s presence, and marches on. The ruins await.\n",
  "page 43": "There is no fire of course, but that doesn’t stop typical rituals from taking place. The ten of you sit in a semicircle, leaning against tree trunks and fallen stumps. If someone were to stumble into your camp, you imagine the company would look like a merry band of freedom fighters, unlike the disciplined, rule-following soldiers of the High King that you are. It all sprouts from Corporal Redding who doesn’t settle down in the center of the camp. Military regulation always has the highest ranking member in the center. The format of Frontrunner’s Camp takes the regulation to near exaggeration levels. But still, Redding places his gear down at the edge of the camp. “More comfortable here,” he said, whether by physical or mental comfort is up for debate.\n\nDinner is dried meat and even drier bread. The bread is manageable if you hold a little drinking water in your mouth when you bite into it. The meat threatens to tear your teeth from your mouth with each bite. Not the most glorious of rations, not the most glorious of assignments, sitting in the dirt, cold, without shining armor or a civilized enemy to fight. It’s ten men against the New World and the secrets of its jungle.\n\nMen speak with whispered breath. You haven’t encountered any enemies, but that does not mean they do not lie in wait. You take a bite into the dried meat as Lionel addresses the group. It’s actually getting better with each bite, surprising enough. Nothing like a juicy steak from an Alteran butcher, though. The thought of one brings the dried meat back to its original tough, bland flavor.\n\n“Did you ever hear the story of the-then High Prince and the Siege of Hayward?\n\nIt’s a familiar tale, as most are revolving around the High King’s glory, though not often do stories of his past are told. There’s a certain stigma attached to referring to the High King as anything but, as if he was born with the crown upon his head. He was born with a crown, just not the crown. You have not heard the tale in many years. Lionel quickly corrects that fact.\n\nThe town of Hayward rested in the comfortable arms of the Proxa Mountain Range. And that’s not to say it lied at the very bottom. Do arms reach to the very floor? No. Hayward settled midway up the range’s peaks. Twisting, winding, roads led to Hayward. To be more accurate, one road led in, and one led out. You see, Hayward was built with the efficiency of a blacksmith. A man was designated to smelt, another to hammer, another to fan the flame. That sort of thing. Hayward’s wealth was in that realm, too. They are miners, with strength like that of a war horse. Long before the day began, Hayward’s citizens journeyed into the mines. Only long after the day ended would they remerge.\n\nOn the single road goods were imported. New pickaxes, food, that sort of thing. And the export, of course, was ore. Hayward steel was finer than any other. Sturdy. The farthest thing from brittle. A military supported by Hayward steel was a dangerous one. The people of Hayward provided it to Alteran. But they also provided it to his enemies. You see, Hayward was neutral by choice. Their town is far enough away from others that they believe the struggle between Alteran and her enemies did not affect them.\n\nA grave mistake. A deadly mistake. A last mistake.\n\nHayward’s treason was clearly discovered. The High Prince discovered it almost immediately. When the bodies of your fallen enemies grip the same sword that’s strapped at your waist, the source is clear. Treason must be dealt with, else it spreads to others. Treason is like the soft words whispered into your ear by a lover. It was the High Prince’s duty to silence such whispers for the protection of Alteran and her citizens.\n\nSo he marched on Hayward. Up the mountains, through the winding path, he marched with a single battalion. The elements tried to stop the prince. Gusts of wind, threatening to throw the battalion down the mountainside, opposed him. On the third day, a hailstorm poured down atop the battalion, slowing their movement to but a walk, the kind an injured man makes when reaching for his crutches. Not even the elements could stop our would-be High King. You see, not even the elements proved a challenge for the man.\n\nHayward ahead, sheer mountainside at his back, the High Prince took the town by storm. The elements could not stop him. They bent to his will. Most ran to their mines to hide from the prince’s wrath. Those who did not were cut down, justice brought about swiftly. Still, the majority of the Hayward people took to the mines. They sought to escape their sentence. The High Prince, waving off the battalion, followed them into the mines. Alone.\n\nDarkness abounded, traveling through unfamiliar territory, the High Prince hunted down each citizen of Hayward. They set traps. They ambushed. They could not fell our King. For three days the prince navigated the mines. Three days later he emerged, covered head to toe in soot, sweat, and blood. Our King.\n\n“Our King,” the men gathered around Lionel speak with a hushed whisper.\n\n“Our King,” you say, caught up in the story, almost forgetting your part.\n",
  "page 46": "“But also, you need someone you can trust. How can I trust you when you have deceived the others?” you ask.\n\n“Must I reveal all to all men?” Corporal Redding retorts in a voice that reminds you of your childhood teachers. “Does a commander disclose his entire charge to the battalion? No. The burden of leadership is keeping secrets. Compartalization. We have a mission. It is not every man’s burden to bear, only the one designation for such a thing.”\n\n“Withheld information is one thing. Blatant deception is another,” is your answer.\n\nThe small grin on Redding’s face grows larger. You can’t help but feel you’ve stepped into his trap. “Imagine you have a child of your own. A son who dreams of becoming a soldier. You read him bedtime stories of conquers, of warlords accomplishing great deeds. And yet, he possesses a weak body, one that has difficulty holding a sword, lacking the endurance to hold a proper shield wall. He asks if he has what it takes to follow in his father’s footsteps and join the High King’s army. What do you tell him?”\n\nYou ponder a moment. “I would tell him it’s no easy thing. I would tell him that he must train his body to become a soldier. I would pour myself into seeing that he accomplishes his task. Your analogy is not a great one. If limited by physical means, even after devoting himself to training, I would tell him the truth to save his life. I would say he does not have what it takes.”\n\n“And if you know he will enlist anyway?”\n\nYou know the damage it would cause, a father instilling doubt in a young mind destined for battle. A soldier needs resolve, the willingness to press through any adversity. Still, you stand by your answer. “If he is my son, then he will not care. He will enlist anyway to prove me wrong. He will fuel the fire within to make me eat those words.”\n\n“So either way, the outcome is the same, perhaps the lie is better suited to prevent hurt. The lie would preserve the relationship between father and son.”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“The men’s outcome will be the same. I have deceived them for the greater good, for their own good. I need you with me. I share the truth so you do not enter into battle with doubt.”\n\nYour course is set. There’s no use in further debating with the corporal. You’ve already given your word to follow. There is no sense in delaying the inevitable. But there is still a small part of you that wonders if the truth disclosed is the real thing, the entire thing. If he is willing to deceive the others for the greater good, it might be the same for your situation. Nearly four years, give or take a few months. He’s not led you wrong yet. You hope he doesn’t change that fact.\n\n“Your point is well taken. Shall we?”\n\nCorporal Redding’s grin turns into a full-toothed smile. “I thought you’d never ask.”\n",
  "page 45": "It takes two more uneventful days until they appear. The time spent in the forest is just enough to where you feel yourself growing accustomed to the overgrowth, knowing which vines can be swept out of the way, which ones are more trouble than worth to cut. You even feel as if your eyes can see better in the constant dim light, although part of that is due to your mind’s recognition of your surroundings, not needing to focus on single things to identify. Just a glance is enough.\n\nStill, you’ve kept quiet about the Blackbird woman. The encounter sits within your thoughts, a new mind tenant who’s taken up permanent residence. If there was a time to bring it up, it was two days ago. You still think it was better not to share. The mission is the ruins. If you’re being totally honest, your masculine bravado has a small sliver to do with it as well. The damsel in distress, the princess needing rescuing, the beautiful native: the story trope doesn’t escape you. When the situation arrives in reality, there’s something captivating, enchanting. They’re stories told from the beginning of time, read to sleeping children. To face it in real life thrusts the mundane into fable.\n\nThe ruins themselves are built within the overgrowth, a part of the forest, their foundation as deep as any root. Dark stone, almost pure black, blends in the fallen structures to the low-lit environment. In their former glory, the ruins would no doubt be built in square stones stacked upon one another, creating sharp corners and a sturdy defense. Now, however, they are crumbling, decaying in the forest. Vines, trees, and overgrowth use the deteriorating walls for support, growing, twisting and climbing up the dark stone. There appears to be four, maybe five, main structures--it’s hard to exactly tell in their fallen state.\n\n“This is it?” Bastus breaks the silence, ever the one charging forward. “We’ve marched here for a whole lotta nothing.”\n\n“Hush yourself,” Redding whispers. “We don’t know if any natives are in the area, taking shelter within.”\n\n“Where would they be taking shelter? The trees offer more cover,” is the big man’s retort.\n\nCorporal Redding doesn’t address the question. He doesn’t give it validation. “We’ll break into two quads. Sweep the perimeter, opposite directions. Observation only. Engage only if engaged upon. Meet on the far side and wait for my command.”\n\n“That only accounts for eight men,” you aptly point out. Just the right time to open your mouth.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Mathematician,” Redding answers. “You’ll stay put with me. We’ll scan the ruins. If the quads cause movement from within, we’ll relay a warning to the others. One for each quad. Any questions?”\n\nThe men only shake their heads and organize themselves into two groups of four. Lionel leads one and Bastus the other. Crouched, weapons drawn, the men creep off in their respective directions, each quad covering half of the perimeter. You take cover behind a fallen tree overlooking the ruins and wait. You do not draw your weapons, but check your holster and sheath, ensuring they will not stick. A few minutes of silence passes. You do not break it. Neither does Redding. The corporal suddenly digs inside his pocket and reveals two thin cigars. They are a deep brown, like the color of a well-brewed mug of liquid chocolate.\n\n“You really can’t expect us to light those up now,” you whisper, eyes turned back to the ruins.\n\n“Are you disobeying orders, soldier?”\n\n“No.”\n\nHe places one in your hand. “I’m told these are rolled with native leaves,” Redding explains. “The Blackbirds supposedly smoke the leaves through long pipes, often staying lit for hours.”\n\n“And?” you can’t help but question.\n\n“And it’s a familiar smell. It’s a friendly smell. Who knows what sort of strange scent we give off. Have you ever wandered into a field with unfamiliar smells? It draws the senses.”\n\nYou see where Redding is going. “I wouldn’t say I often journey through unexplored flower fields, but I get your point.” He hands you a match next, which you quickly light on the side of your boot, finding a small section that’s uncovered with dirt. A puff of smoke fills the air. Redding places the end of his cigar against yours, inhaling and lighting it without wasting a second match.\n\nThe flavor is new to you. A freshness accompanies, like the bite of an apple plucked directly from the tree, a cold gulp of water taken from a spring. Then relaxation ensues, a sudden calm rushing through your body quicker than any crashing wave, its subsiding like the tide returning to the ocean. Another puff. Another rush.\n\n“I have known you for how long now?” Redding asks.\n\nA strange question for the moment. “Nearly four years, give or take a few months,” you answer.\n\n“And have I ever given you reason to doubt my judgment?”\n\n“Yes. But not for my own well-being.”\n\nThe answer brings a grin to the corporal’s lips, one that is rarely absent. “Wise choice of words. You are not afraid to speak your mind, and yet you follow orders. Both must be present in a good soldier. Without questioning, a soldier is but a body armed. Without following, he is undependable. You are both armed and dependable. It’s sad to say, but that is not the same for the company. Bastus is the former, Lionel is the latter. You are both parts combined.”\n\n“Sir, I appreciate the compliment, but this is hardly the time and place for such reminiscence.”\n\n“It is exactly the time for such a thing. I will ask something of you now, and you must speak your mind and follow orders.”\n\nYou do not speak. Corporal Redding continues.\n\n“I am going into the ruins, and I need you to follow. I have been less than truthful with the others. Our patrol is simply a cover for another, more important assignment. I need a man I can trust, one that will speak his mind and follow orders. Are you that man?”\n\nWith a puff of smoke, you say, “You know that I am.”\n",
  "page 48": "A few days later the company is called upon. Given ample rest time, which you gladly made the most of, your commanders now expect contribution, and after a few days with no orders, the company is ready to give it. At the start of the voyage from Alteran, the soldiers were content to sit idle, drink, gamble, and sleep the day away. After many weeks of it, along with the landing, you’re ready for action. There’s a major difference between a soldier who’s trained for battle versus a soldier longing for it: the company is both, and desperately wants to bring the fight to the Blackbirds.

The grizzly company leader says it better than anyone. “Time you lot earned your keep. Drinking the ale stores aboard the High King’s fleet simply won’t cut it. Glory for the High King, glory to your lineage.”\n\nNot the most inspiring as far as speeches go, but Redding holds an unconventional style that speaks to a man. Genuine. One man to another, rather than top-down. Lionel speaks up. Straight to the point, as always.\n\n“Orders, sir?”\n\n“We’ve got something of a special assignment,” Redding answers.\n\nBastus cuts him off before he can continue, perhaps a result of Redding not leveraging rank, not that he ever seems to mind. “Special? So we won’t be marching on the Blackbirds that assaulted us?”\n\n“Not directly,” the corporal says. “We’ve noted their location for the Frontrunner scouts. Those who have settled into their tour are better suited to march to combat. This goes above Captain Briggs, even. Rest assured, they will be dealt with.”\n\nSilence hangs over the men, each likely thinking they would be involved in the High King’s retribution. Two members were lost in the landing. Promises were made. Revenge was to be yours. Seems command has another idea, however.\n\n“Our orders, then. Sir,” you keep the conversation going.\n\n“Run-of-the-mill patrol,” Redding speaks, pulling a piece of string from his tunic. Satisfied at its removal, he continues. “There’s a set of ruins northwest of Frontrunner’s. Command hasn’t been able to spare enough soldiers to explore the area. That’s where we come in.”\n\n“Patrol? No combat?” Bastus asks, the shoulders of the large man seemingly slumping with his rhetorical question.\n\n“No hostiles anticipated, no. You know as well as I that there’s always the possibility.”\n\n“What’s so special about these ruins?” you ask.\n\nCorporal Redding looks right at you with his response. “It’s some sort of fallen temple, a holy place once used by the natives here.”\n\n“And what’s so special?” you ask, again.\n\n“You mean that an order from an officer in the High King’s military isn’t special enough for you?” Redding lets his words sink in for a second, a grin appearing at the edge of his lips. “Ok, here’s added background detail, so you can bring greater glory to the High King, of course. The fact is, our wizards, scholars, and tacticians haven’t been able to figure out the source of the Blackbird power. The current hypothesis is that it lies with their religion. If we can learn something from their beliefs, then it may help with nullifying their power.”\n\n“You mean besides the fact that they stand a full head taller than the largest Alteran,” Lionel points out.\n\n“Speak for yourself, little man,” Bastus instantly retorts.\n\nRedding waves a hand to silence the two before the conversation deteriorates into bickering. “Have you already forgotten our landing? The natives, the Blackbirds are crude in their technology. And still, they were able to sink our ships. It doesn’t matter if they stand two feet from the ground if their magic allows for the destruction of ships. We may not be engaging those who stole the lives of our two brothers, but we could very well discover the secret that will collapse their entire military might.”\n\nYou take the opportunity to sum up. “So we’re to patrol a set of ruins, ones that may hold the secret to an ancient power of a New World, into uncharted territory, while it’s uncertain whether traps or enemies lie in wait, ready to ambush us?”\n\n“When you put it that way, it does sound like a rather important assignment,” Bastus comments.\n\n“Agreed,” Lionel can’t help but say, a murmurous echo from the rest of the company.\n\nCorporal Redding simply holds his grin.\n",
  "page 47": "Corporal Redding looks at you expectantly. He takes a deep inhale from the cigar, the exhale seemingly lasting longer. “Well?” he says. “What do you have for me?”\n\nYou mimic the action. “Nothing worth the moment. I’m ready.”\n\nRedding’s eyes narrow. “Really, now. You’re willing to charge in without further questions?”\n\nYou shrug. “Four years, give or take a few months. Enough has been answered in that time.”\n\n“Interesting way to view things,” Corporal Redding muses, one hand absent-mindedly scratching at his beard. “But I cannot use you, then. I told you what I needed. You’re to stay put here.”\n\nAnger suddenly sweeps through your body. You feel your face get hot as if sleeping too close to a campfire. The anger is built from the feeling of being wronged, like a man adamantly speaking the truth and yet a mob believes him to be a liar. Still, you manage to keep your voice down. Somehow. “That’s it? After all this time, after what you just shared, you’re going to leave me behind? I’ve passed your test--you know it--and yet, you change the answers.”\n\n“Keep your voice down,” Redding speaks in a hushed whisper. Perhaps your voice wasn’t as down as you thought it was. “Yes, that’s it. Four years, give or take a few months...it was a hell of a ride. You’re ordered to stay here. Will you obey command, soldier?”\n\nYou nod. It’s all you can do. You fear opening your mouth will result in another outburst.\n\n“Good.”\n\nRedding’s face is absent of his normal grin. The small sign of mischief, of amusement is gone. In its place a blank look appears, one that you’ve never seen on the man. It’s the face of a soulless sculpture, the face of a man dying in his sleep. It’s then that you realize the test didn’t change: it just wasn’t over. You can’t help but feel you’ve disappointed the man. He clearly was banking on your success. What’s done is done. There’s no point chastising yourself for it.\n\n“Stay put here,” Redding says another time. His voice is emotionless. It’s the voice children fear lies under their bed.\n\nAgain, you nod. The anger still burns a heavy weight within your chest. Suddenly a pair of weathered hands wrap around your throat. The surprise causes a brief moment of shock, and for a second you forget your training, kicking your feet out and flailing like a recruit. Redding’s hands tighten around your throat, the pressure bringing you to your back. Your head knocks against the fallen tree trunk in the motion, the least of your worry in the current moment.\n\nHis fingers are like shackles, his pressure constant. As you fell back, you relieved just enough pressure for a sip or two of air. Now, on your back there is no such space to be found. The pressure deepens. A gurgle escapes your mouth then stops, no longer possessing enough air for a simple choking sound. The feeling of drowning assaults your senses, the feeling of being lost underwater without the means of reaching the surface.\n\nYou try to kick him off. Redding counters. You try to shift your weight for a grasp of air. Redding counters. You try to pry his hands from your throat. Redding counters.\n\n“I’m sorry, kid,” he whispers as the edges of your vision fade black, taking over entirely at an alarming rate. “It’s for the greater good.”\n\nThe last thing you see is Corporal Redding’s face, absent of his ever-present grin, eyes lifeless, a state which you soon take. Your journey to the New World ends at the hands of your corporal.\n",

So we won’t be marching on the Blackbirds that assaulted us?”\n\n“Not directly,” the corporal says. “We’ve noted their location for the Frontrunner scouts. Those who have settled into their tour are better suited to march to combat. This goes above Captain Briggs, even. Rest assured, they will be dealt with.”\n\nSilence hangs over the men, each likely thinking they would be involved in the High King’s retribution. Two members were lost in the landing. Promises were made. Revenge was to be yours. Seems command has another idea, however.\n\n“Our orders, then. Sir,” you keep the conversation going.\n\n“Run-of-the-mill patrol,” Redding speaks, pulling a piece of string from his tunic. Satisfied at its removal, he continues. “There’s a set of ruins northwest of Frontrunner’s. Command hasn’t been able to spare enough soldiers to explore the area. That’s where we come in.”\n\n“Patrol? No combat?” Bastus asks, the shoulders of the large man seemingly slumping with his rhetorical question.\n\n“No hostiles anticipated, no. You know as well as I that there’s always the possibility.”\n\n“What’s so special about these ruins?” you ask.\n\nCorporal Redding looks right at you with his response. “It’s some sort of fallen temple, a holy place once used by the natives here.”\n\n“And what’s so special?” you ask, again.\n\n“You mean that an order from an officer in the High King’s military isn’t special enough for you?” Redding lets his words sink in for a second, a grin appearing at the edge of his lips. “Ok, here’s added background detail, so you can bring greater glory to the High King, of course. The fact is, our wizards, scholars, and tacticians haven’t been able to figure out the source of the Blackbird power. The current hypothesis is that it lies with their religion. If we can learn something from their beliefs, then it may help with nullifying their power.”\n\n“You mean besides the fact that they stand a full head taller than the largest Alteran,” Lionel points out.\n\n“Speak for yourself, little man,” Bastus instantly retorts.\n\nRedding waves a hand to silence the two before the conversation deteriorates into bickering. “Have you already forgotten our landing? The natives, the Blackbirds are crude in their technology. And still, they were able to sink our ships. It doesn’t matter if they stand two feet from the ground if their magic allows for the destruction of ships. We may not be engaging those who stole the lives of our two brothers, but we could very well discover the secret that will collapse their entire military might.”\n\nYou take the opportunity to sum up. “So we’re to patrol a set of ruins, ones that may hold the secret to an ancient power of a New World, into uncharted territory, while it’s uncertain whether traps or enemies lie in wait, ready to ambush us?”\n\n“When you put it that way, it does sound like a rather important assignment,” Bastus comments.\n\n“Agreed,” Lionel can’t help but say, a murmurous echo from the rest of the company.\n\nCorporal Redding simply holds his grin.\n",
  "page 42": "The trek begins late in the morning, unable to start at standard military march time due to the lack of light. The other men in the company take the time to catch up on sleep. The thing is, you’ve had plenty since arriving to Frontrunner’s, enough to recover from the landing. Alone you sit, back rested against the trunk of a tree, the world dark and formless around you. It would be peaceful except for the restlessness that seeps into your being. resting when you should be acting, sleeping when you should be awake, patrolling when you should be fighting. But you’re a soldier, paid to follow orders, not think. The restlessness channels itself into the constant shake of your leg, able to stop when focused upon, but quickly starts its steady rhythm subconsciously.\n\nIt’s quiet. Unlike the forests of Alteran, full of wildlife making themselves known, the forest of the New World is silent, like a predator stalking its prey, a thief in the shadow of an alley. Your thoughts are interrupted by the sudden need to relieve yourself. Like the trees around you, you step without a sound over the sleeping bodies of the others, your coat hanging from your shoulders unbuttoned. You find a lucky tree, one of the varieties with vines wrapped around the trunk as if a serpent. Your trouser buttons soon are in the same state as your coat, the pressure in your bladder slowly subsiding. The silence of the forest is interrupted for a few lengthy seconds by the sound of your stream. You turn to head back to camp--\n\n--and find yourself staring face to face with a woman.\n\nShe’s a native. Despite the first Blackbird you’ve seen up close, your mind is very far from her strange attire, the color of her skin, the shape of her face. Oddly enough, you think of the unbuttoned state you were just seconds ago, your manhood out in the morning air. It’s not the same as being caught with your pants down, but it’s damn near close. You flash a smile, hoping the embarrassment is too apparent on your face.\n\nThe moment passed, you finally get a good look at the woman, noticing that she does not return your smile. She wears a dress of tanned leather, not meant to accentuate her womanly parts--they are doing quite a good job on their own. The woman’s hair is black, like the darkness on a moonless night, loosely tied with a single braid running down the left side of her face. Unfamiliar symbols line her ankles and wrists, black tattoos almost unseen in the low light. She’s unarmed, yet the lean muscle on her sleeveless arms clearly shows that she is not deterred by the fact. You guess she’s a few years older than you.\n\nYour hand tenses in a half reach towards the flintlock at your thigh, like that of a duelist, watching, ready to burst into movement. Your eyes meet the woman’s. Hers are a bright green, a reflection of the canopy overhead. Yours, a deep brown like that of a sturdy trunk.\n\nShe whispers a string of words unfamiliar to you. All that you’ve heard about the Blackbirds never included their language spoken. Perhaps no one has gotten this close before.\n\n“I don’t understand…” you whisper back, motioning your hands and shrugging your shoulders in a way that would be apparent to any Alteran of your meaning.\n\nThe woman’s face is blank; no sign of recognition appears. Although she may have spots of dirt on her, as well as not keeping up with the latest Alteran fashion, she’s undoubtedly beautiful, her skin like that of her dress, tanned, each side of her face a mirror of the other.\n\nShe whispers again. You recognize some of the words, but only because it seems to be the same string as before.\n\n“I don’t understand,” is all you can muster for a response.\n\nThe Blackbird woman stares at you for several seconds, her green eyes steady and focused, her mind searching for a solution. She finds it. Her voice in the common tongue is broken. Simple. Straightforward. Stripped of unnecessary inflection. There’s a strange tone to it. It’s sharp. Direct. Higher pitched as a woman, but yet carrying the strength of a stage performer required to project. Unwavering. All of this you catch in a single word.\n\n“Go.”\n\nBefore you can respond, the Blackbird woman scampers off into the trees. You know better than to chase her. There could be others lying in wait, the woman herself the bait. Even if she’s alone, there\u0027s a risk of becoming lost in the overgrowth, separated from your company without a hope of rescue. No, your mission is to patrol the ruins, not run after local natives through the trees. Still, the meeting itself felt...friendly?\n\nThat’s as best as you can describe it for now. Go. Was that a warning? A threat? A plea? Hard to tell without knowing Blackbird social customs. Being the veteran of many tours, you’re well-aware of different mannerisms that accompany different territories. Meeting the eyes is considered rude in some, while it’s perfectly polite in another. The offering of a left hand is as good as a slap in the face, while it’s the crudest gesture to use the right. That sort of thing. After making the mistake of forcing Alteran custom on your first tours, it’s not a mistake you plan to make again.\n\nYour eyes deeply attuned to the dark, you start to notice the smallest signs of light appearing through the forest canopy. You will be traveling again soon. It would be best to return back to camp. You retrace your steps, a little more carefully this time in the case the Blackbird woman wasn’t alone.\n\nLuckily, you don’t run into any others. As you reenter the camp, the distinct sound of a flintlock click fills the morning air. You raise both hands up defensively instinctively.\n\n“Gods, boy. You can’t go running off like that,” Corporal Redding says as he holsters the weapon.\n\n“Had to find a nice tree to water. Besides, I didn’t want to cause jealousy,” you reply. The joke causes a small chuckle among those standing near.\n\nYou think about sharing the encounter with the Blackbird woman, but you hold off. Now that you’ve had a longer chance to think about it, it seemed more of a warning than a threat. She did not carry any weapons or show aggression. She was alone, meaning she intentionally did not bring warriors with her, not even for protection. Strange that one of them would go out of her way to help. Your first encounter with a Blackbird is not what you expected. For one, you’re both still alive. These thoughts rest on your mind like a word escaping memory recall, a puzzle missing a key piece.\n\nThe company packs their gear, doing their best to hide the camp’s presence, and marches on. The ruins await.\n",
  "page 41": "Equipment packed, you depart from Frontrunner’s Camp shortly after Corporal Redding’s “inspiring” speech. Despite the fact that your company is down two men, you aren’t reinforced to the normal 12 members. The New World forces must be thin if protocol is to be broken that way, which only reinforces the need for green soldiers to patrol a set of ruins. If there were anyone to spare, they’d have explored the area already. It’s not often the Alteran military finds itself thin. In the Old World, it possesses more might, resources, and land than the rest, although Fargrave may dispute that point. Here, however, it seems things are different. The land is vast and the number of enemies are unknown. Truly a place the High King’s soldiers have no experience with.\n\nSurprisingly, no other company joins you, only adding to the afore-mentioned facts. You can’t think of another time where the company went on its own, certainly not for an entire mission. But still, it’s not your place to think. That job is left for soldiers with more ribbons on their chest, their families with heavy coffers.\n\nRedding leads the company from the front, the rest of you arranged two-by-two. Bastus takes the rear by his lonesome, the large man counting for two on his own. The forest is thick. Like the overgrowth to which you arrived, the journey makes for slow going. It’s just thin enough to cause the occasional swipe of the sword to clear the way. Luckily, you aren’t required to chop your way through the entire jungle-like growth.\n\nTrees and plants, unlike you’ve seen before, lie in your path. At first they blended together, a mix of unfamiliar flora becoming one. But now that you’ve been up-close and personal, on two occasions now, you’re starting to see recognizable overgrowth, a tree trunk wrapped with vines spreading to its branches, small ferns that close in on themselves when touched. The ferns in particular made a few soldiers jump at first--along with a joke from Bastus about filling one’s trousers. As the journey continues, you step on them without a care, unblinking to the movement underneath your feet.\n\nAs full of life as the forest may have first appeared, there’s something off-putting about it. Overgrowth is just plantlife flourishing rampantly. While it should signify just that--life--it doesn’t give that sort of feeling in the slightest. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s the light, or rather, lack thereof. Thick canopy above, the overgrowth doesn’t allow sunlight to peer through. Instead, you’re left to trample through the forest floor in a dusk-like darkness, eyes long adjusted, the mind is slower to follow. It’s a wonder that the plants can even thrive in such a place, without sunlight. The scholars at the High King’s University would fill their trousers at the chance to study them. You silently commit to laying your bedroll as far away from Bastus after that thought appears in your mind; his poor taste in jokes is contagious it seems.\n\nA day of trudging through the forest waning down, you begin to set up camp, something that must be done earlier in the day thanks to the shady canopy above, and it’s not like you can simply light torches and continue. Despite the increased chance of drawing attackers, you run the risk of setting the whole damn place on fire. You estimate the day isn’t yet three-quarters down, and you’re settling in for the night. As you find a nice spot, free from roots poking their heads through the dirt, Bastus notices and puts his roll next to yours.\n\n“Looks like we’re bunkmates again,” the big man comments.\n\n“Lucky me,” you utter.\n",
  "page 101": "Long ago before the first outsiders arrived, the city of Harri’katan was the world’s greatest empire. Alteran wasn’t even a thought in the founding member’s minds, for they wouldn’t come into existence for many centuries. There stood but one city, one nation of note: Harri’katan. The city itself was built into the very forest of the New World, as if it grew naturally along with the trees, vines, and overgrowth that surrounded it, intertwined it, part of it. It stood a city, yes. But most cities aren’t the size of entire nations. Take Magda and throw in a few territories of Alteran, and you have an idea of the size of Harri’katan.\n\nThere, the people were united under a single banner. All the tribes of Harri’ar were one. And not only were they allies in battle, they were family. You see, it’s a simple matter to throw a bunch of young men in uniform, slap a sword in their hands, and say “charge!” The goal is clearly defined. Battle forges bonds that a peaceful life simply cannot keep pace with, minus the occasional sick community member who finds themselves in an early grave. So, perhaps, it is not battle that forges bonds, but death, the only inevitability in life. Yet without the constant threat of death facing the Harri’ar--a strange thing how it’s always threatening, but it largely goes unaddressed--the tribes were united under one chieftain. The man-god. Amir’sshan.\n\nAmir’sshan, undefeated in a thousand battles. Amir’sshan, a harem boasting a number greater than entire tribes. Amir’sshan, chieftain of chieftains.\n\nThe odd thing was, no one can quite remember how Amir’sshan took rule. He’s been chieftain as long as the elders had been alive, longer even; the ancient ancestors knew of the man-god and spoke of him through story, passed down from generation to generation. The Raven incarnate, they said. Whether true or not, the chieftain has kept the same complexion for a thousand generations. Ageless. Timeless. Who’s to say he is not the Raven’s second coming.\n\nAn organization underground, that’s who.\n\nBehold! The godkiller, a weapon of black mithril. It took a hundred years to recover the mithril ore needed to forge the weapon. The metal broke the most sturdy of blacksmith tools, sat in the fire of the forge like it was a cool bath. It took the magma of a volcano and the pressure of a waterfall to shape the mithril, but they did it. By the Father Sun above, they did it. A dagger, ravenblack blade, wing-tipped. The godkiller, infused with all the combined strength of all their faith, not to mention binding spells, auras, and holy magic.\n\nDeep in the utmost layer of Harri’katan, they resided, beneath the slums, even. It didn’t feel safe enough to the members, a council of nine. Eight of them were priests. One, a renown warrior in the city. That’s the thing about religious authority. They have power over any individual, minus Amir’sshan and his royal guard, who, interestingly, don’t seem to be religious, despite their honor-bound duty to protect the man-god with their lives. Perhaps it’s because their deity lives and breathes before them, walking the same stairs, the same hallway that they wander. Perhaps it’s a more practical approach to reverence. They have a task, and they complete it to damn-near perfection.\n\nNot perfection, mind you. Enter, the godkiller.\n\nA starless night was when they came. Clouds covered the heavens from sight of their own, the man-god. At exactly the same moment, the poison in his guards’ drinks took hold, the man-god’s servants, which were actually the organization’s servants, unlocked the hidden entrance. They took Amir’sshan’s palace in a great wave, his guards too affected by the poison to muster a fight. The suddenness of the attack, the ferocity of the assassins. Unmatched, in all history. They found the god-man sitting upon his throne, well, laying across his throne, sideways, like lounging on a couch.\n\nHis face is not that of a strong chieftain or prince. It’s symmetrical, yes, without any malformed or unproportionate features. There’s something about it though, off-putting. It’s the face of a man who sets upon travelers mixed with the understanding eyes of a high priest. It’s the face of a caring father, a drunk beggar in the street, the commander on a battlefield. Amir’sshan’s face may be symmetrical in shape, but it’s far from balanced. When they breached his throne room, a place with arched ceilings as high as the eye can see, he paid them no mind. The assassins strode past each column, supporting beams thicker than any tree in the forest. When even reaching the first of the seven steps to the throne, he didn’t glance up, simply examined his fingernails like they were the most interesting thing in the world.\n\n“My subjects,” he spoke through a voice soft for a legend. “How polite of you to disturb your sleep in order to give me company.” Amir’sshan wore nothing but his a’lta, a blanket-like garment tied around his waist. The chieftain’s a’lta was black with embroidered white. Without armor, the man-god left his chest exposed; his torso, lean muscle and tanned skin, unmarked with tattoos unlike most of the Harri’ar.\n\nThe leader of the organization stepped forward. Rels’umbra, his face shrouded beneath the shadow of his hood. With both hands curled around his staff, a raven carved at the top, the priest, the ringleader, the would-be assassin, spoke. “Your rule is at an end, Amir’sshan.”\n\nHis lack of reverence was duly noted. It’s been decades since Amir’sshan hadn’t been addressed by any number of his titles, least of all in the throne room itself. Violent executions have a way of solving matters of respect...or lack thereof. For a time, at least, until it united people to meet in the shadows, plotting one’s downfall. Case in point, Rel’sumbra and friends.\n\n“Is it now,” Amir’sshan raised an eyebrow. It touches the tip of his chieftain’s headdress, ravenblack feathers stretching down the sides of his face and back. “My chair and hat would speak otherwise.”\n\nThe assassins remained steadfast. For they have grown to expect certain...oddities from their “chieftain.”\n\n“A chieftain who doesn’t age brings stagnation to a people. The Harri’ar need a chieftain who was raised up with the people he rules. To understand their needs. Their struggles. You do not relate to the tribes. Once upon a time, perhaps, but you are too far removed. For the good of the Harri’ar and the Raven’s will, you must be removed. Will you go quietly?”\n\n“Have you come quietly?” Amir’sshan swung his legs on the ground, sitting on the throne normally now, both elbows resting on his knees. “Have you come with ulterior motives? Power? Someone has to take my place. Would it be you, Rel’sumbra?”\n\n“The council has decided, yes. I’m to be your replacement. The Raven’s will be done.”\n\n“YOUR will be done,” Amir’sshan spat. “You are no more aligned with the Raven’s will than the heretics who worship demons, transfixed by a small display of power.”\n\n“You speak falsely. I can understand your frustration. It’s no easy thing to surrender rule after such a span.”\n\nA cruel grin appeared at Amir’sshan’s lips. “You speak falsely if you think I am surrendering rule.”\n\nRel’sumbra, calm as always, spoke beneath the shroud of his hood. “I had a feeling you would say that.” One hand left his ravenheaded staff and reached within his robe. The dagger he pulled, hiding underneath his robe, doesn’t shine or gleam being brought into the light as most daggers would. Instead it seemed to eat the light, devouring rays normally cast into reflection. Recognition appears on Amir’sshan’s face, starting first with his eyes, widening larger than normal, then cascading down the rest, flaring nostrils, paralyzing lips, holding breath. Behold! The godkiller.\n\nAs quickly as recognition appeared, faster even, rage took its place, a righteous fury that arose during times of forced injustice. It’s the flash of anger when learning about a loved one’s rape, the heat that surfaces when shameful actions are exposed to the public eye. Quite a motivator, that. Paired with nine individuals who would remove the man-god from rule with a blade in his back… Yes, it’d been many moon cycles since Amir’sshan faced combat. No one dared challenge him. He had an army to conquer in his stead. He welcomed the battle back like a long lost friend. His oldest friend, returning. The man-god would share the joy with nine of his subjects.\n\nAmir’sshan leaped from the throne, above the small steps that lead to it, and landed in the center of the nine, unarmed. His fists became a blur; Rel’sumbra, with eyes dexterous as they come, could hardly keep up. Like one cloud melding into the next, edges undefined, Amir’sshan’s punches blended into the next. The unfortunate priest who Amir’sshan focused on first likely didn’t know which hand was raining upon him.\n\nRed mists of blood splashed in the air, showering on Amir’sshan and the nearest assassins. The priest crumpled underneath the flurry, his back bending over first like a bridge, exposing his chest and throat to the world, to the man-god; his chest was caved in from the blows, like an inlet on the coast. A sickening snap. A sigh--at least something similar to it, the final breath left the priest’s lungs, hanging in the air, sobering the other assassins. Do they not know? They seek to kill a god. Before the fight had even begun, one of their members lay dead, beaten to death in front of his allies.\n\nAt the sight of their dead, Rel’sumbra and the other assassins acted. Holy magic spilled from the priests; the warrior, Gh’enna, covered head to toe in black bone armor, charged, battle-axe raised high overhead. Amir’sshan rolled to his left, a white bolt of magic landing in the place he stood a moment before, a white bolt that left behind a blackened scar on the stone floor. From nowhere, two blades came into existence in Amir’sshan’s hands, longswords that dwell beyond the void called--no, commanded--into service by the man-god, their edges translucent, ethereal.\n\nEither by Amir’sshan’s speed or the blurred sword edges, perhaps both, his blades seemed to double in number. Before Gh’enna could bring his battle-axe down on the man-god, no less than ten cuts appeared on his legs, running up the length of his torso, the final one landing at his throat. The warrior staggered for a moment, the realization of his fatal wounds settling in. Then, in what would cause a cloud of dust on the battlefield, he collapsed backward with a solid thud. There was no dust cloud, however. Only emptiness and a traitorous warrior slain by the hand of his chieftain.\n\n“Thought this would be easy, did you?” Thought you could take power for yourself, did you?” Amir’sshan spoke, walking towards the priests, sword points used in emphasis. Rel’sumbra could see the edges of the blades now. By the Raven he could see them, for they were highlighted red with Gh’enna’s blood, a crimson stain on otherwise flawless weapons.\n\n“More still stand against your tyranny!” Rel’sumbra slammed the butt of his staff into the floor, his way of emphasizing his point. A small rumble echoed upon impact, the sound of the release of magic. Visible ripples spanned out from the staff, like that of throwing a rock into a pond. Amir’sshan thought he heard the flutter of wings. The remaining priests, now six excluding Rel’sumbra, screamed into the air. No, that’s not right. They screeched, a primal tone as wild as any animal in the jungle.\n\nAncient, even compared to Harri’katan, even compared to Amir’sshan himself, magic flowed from Rel’sumbra’s ravenheaded staff. Before he had used holy magic to attempt to smite Amir’sshan. If Gh’enna didn’t die instantly, he would have used it in healing. This magic is different, however. Far from the realm of holy, good, farther even than “gray” areas, the realm of morally ambiguous, a mixture of both holy and evil. The priests’ hands curled in pain, in power. Fingers grasped at unseen objects in their palms, flexing their palms turned skyward. The very bones within their body seemed to reorient themselves, sickening cracks confirming the fact, bulging in various sections of their neck and limbs, threatening to burst from the very skin that contained them.\n\nBlack wisps of magic encircled the priests’ feet, spiraling up their body like a poisonous snake wrapping itself around a tree branch. Ribbons of black magic hang in the air like sparks leaving the safety of their flame. Amir’sshan noticed Rel’sumbra was unaffected by the ancient power. As the black wisps spanned upward, covering the priests entirely in a dark shroud, Amir’sshan spoke again.\n\n“Tyranny, you say. Perhaps you do deserve to rule. The way you volunteer those beneath you to sacrifice their body for the cause.”\n\n“They knew the cost and gladly paid it,” Rel’sumbra answered, both hands back on the staff. A casual posture for the way his allies screeched in pain not five feet away from his position. “The Harri’ar are willing to lay down their life to remove you from rule. Can you say there are those willing to do the same to keep you here?”\n\nAmir’sshan muffled a laugh. The priests cry out in pain. “There’s a reason you had to plot in the underground. You’ve removed those from the equation.”\n\n“That is their duty, not their belief.”\n\n“The two are mutually exclusive?”\n\n“Enough! Your time is at an end. For the good of the people.”\n\n“For the good of Rel’sumbra,” Amir’sshan corrected.\n\n“Those two are mutually exclusive?” Rel’sumbra fired back.\n\n“Ahhh, now you’re learning,” Amir’sshan said. Movement caught his eye, the dark wisps starting to vanish from sight, fading from existence the way spilled water evaporates after an amount of time. Upon subsiding, it revealed the abominations beneath.\n\nIn the place where hooded priests stood, bird-like creatures, tall as a man. Talons took the place where praying hands once did, also bursting through their boots. Their heads became the very Blackbird that they worship, the face of a raven staring back at Amir’sshan, their hoods able to contain the transformation as well as their boots. Black beady eyes reorient themselves with their surroundings. Amir’sshan knew the transformation never took place before, not with the specific men in front of him; it’s a one-way journey designed to turn the tide in a single battle, in this case, to turn the tide against him.\n\nIt would not be enough.\n\n“I noticed that you remain un--” Amir’sshan started to say before the ravenheaded priests leaped towards him. They had no wings, but possessed strength beyond that of Harri’ar’s greatest warrior...excluding the chieftain of chieftains, that is. To Rel’sumbra’s dismay, instead of fear, a smile crept across Amir’sshan’s face. It’s the smile of a laborer as he took his first sip of evening ale. Subtle. Present. Six dark figures flew in the air towards Amir’sshan, talons ready to carve the eyes from the chieftain’s skull; six figures, to rip the innards from his body in a series of blasphemous strikes.\n\nIn a sight that future bondsmen would recognize, one of the translucent swords in Amir’sshan’s palm became a spear. Small thunderclouds. Black smoke. Transformation, the furthest thing from an abomination, far more graceful than the priests before him. It was meant to be. The sword was no longer meant to be a sword. It was meant to be a spear, and surrendered its form to the man-god. Then, quicker than the shape shift, quicker than the swords first appeared in his hands, it left Amir’sshan’s palm, singing a sinister whistle along its flight path.\n\nIt impaled the nearest priest through the chest--no, that’s not accurate. It tore through the nearest priest, both spearhead and shaft passing through his body with no more ease than dipping an oar into water. It impaled the second nearest priest, stopping the momentum of his leap, reversing it entirely, skewering the former holy man against the wall like a proud banner sending glory and exaltation in bright colors.\n\nOne spear. Two dead. Four remaining.\n\nThey fell upon him, four abominations seeking blood. A funny thought occurred in Amir’shhan’s mind: in their eyes, he is the abomination. He might not have twisted his body into half bird, half man, but there’s no denying his existence is unlike that of the Harri’ar. The man-god, they called him, living for centuries, never aging, keeping the same complexion. There’s something sure as hell unnatural about the man(-god) himself, yet it lies underneath the surface rather than expressing itself in the physical, at least not in the way that would capture the honest, if not rude, attention of a small child with the ability to point fingers. After a few generations, however… Small thunderclouds. Black smoke. The remaining weapon in his hand became a greatsword, two hands needed to swing with any strength behind the large blade.\n\nThe head of a Blackbird rolled to the floor, its body finding a few more steps before collapsing behind it. Like a headless chicken. Amir’sshan can’t contain it. “Ha-ha-ha-ha!” His laughter is maddening to the remaining others. He’s laughing. Laughing! As he cut through their ranks with no more ease than shaving in the morning. This was supposed to be their triumphant night, one that had been planned for years. The perfect night to (Amir’sshan drove the point of his greatsword into another Blackbird. Two.) catch the chieftain unaware, exposed. Yet he considered their threat nothing more than a minor nuisance. Laughing.\n\nLaughing!\n\nLAUGHING!\n\nThunderclouds. A nine tailed whip now rested in the chieftain’s palm. The swing caused a crack rivaling a real storm, snapping in the air like a bolt of lightning seeking a tree trunk, leaving behind a blackened husk of where life once stood. Amir’sshan’s whip left behind a similar figure. It took several swings, but the result was the same. Lifeless, hollow figures remained. A bolt of lightning possessed mercy. A single strike, and it’s over. Quick. Painless. The opposite could be said for the man-god’s nine tail. Unable to hide his glee, he overwhelmed the two harri’ar with furious swings, each one marking their body with cuts. Soon they were unrecognizable, a four-limbed frame underneath a thousand bleeding cuts. The room was filled with the crack of the whip. And laughter. Plenty of laughter.\n\nAll his support dealt with, Amir’sshan turned his attention towards Rel’sumbra. Only the assassin is not there. Then where did… Pain bursted through the man-god’s back. He holds no vision, yet images rush into his mind, Rel’sumbra standing behind him, hand gripped firmly around the (godkiller!) black mithril dagger, seeking to drive it further into the exposed back of the chieftain, its blade already sunk deep into Amir’sshan’s lower back to the hilt. A coldness overtook Amir’sshan’s body, like stepping out from the safety of a warm hut into snowfall.\n\nUnsuccessfully, he tried reaching behind him to grab the dagger. The attempt caused Rel’sumbra to twist--pain flashed. Thousands of years entered Amir’sshan’s mind, hanging a moment, before vanishing. Life. Love. Lost. He’d been alive far longer than most. He’d loved few in the timespan, all early on, for he quickly learned that they would die while he kept going. After his third love died, he cut himself from such emotion. Instead he built a harem, allowing the physical manifestation of such feelings to be quenched with women as replaceable as a blunt dagger. Never the same one more than a few times. Amir’sshan couldn’t trust himself to lay with the same one too often, otherwise he risked love rearing its ugly head, setting himself down a path that leads only to death. Lost. He’d lost more than a man could ever seek to gain, even in his wildest imagination, loved ones only being a fraction of the loss.\n\nHot breath touched Amir’sshan’s ears in spoken word. Their tone, violent. “Thus ends the rule of Amir’sshan, tyrant of the Harri’ar. Your death will cause a parade in the streets. Tears of joy will fall. For tomorrow begins the rule of the just Rel’sumbra. And after my lifespan, another will take my place. It is the natural order of things. You have stagnated our people for too long.”\n\nAmir’sshan forced a chuckle, which ended up being a cough of blood. “Poor Rel’sumbra. The people will follow whoever wears the headdress. They are sheep as afraid of their shepherd as wolves. Your ideology means nothing. Whether I lead or you lead, they care little...as long as you do not disturb their simple, boring lives.”\n\n“I’ll live without their gratitude. You on the other hand…”\n\nRel’sumbra ripped the godkiller from the man-god’s back. Amir’sshan dropped to his knees. Soft hands grabbed for the chieftain’s throat, hands unaccustomed to performing laborious tasks themselves. Before sliding the mithril dagger across Amir’sshan’s neck, the assassin pulled the chieftain’s headdress from the crown of his head.\n\n“Farewell, man-god.”\n\nBefore the godkiller could bring finality to the evening’s skirmish, Amir’sshan briefly glanced heavenward, the whites of his eyes exposed, unfamiliar to the feeling of helplessness. It’d been a while since he felt that. Father Sun, it felt good. A new experience. The preciousness of mortality. An ending to make the journey sweeter. Men spend their lives avoiding death. Amir’sshan, the man-god, chieftain of chieftains welcomed it with open arms. Finally, restfulness could greet him. Finally, an end to everlong suffering.\n\nRel’sumbra cut Amir’sshan’s throat. Blood flowed out like a waterfall.\n",
  "page 100": "The path set forward, the rest of the day is largely uneventful. Preparation is in order, and there are no more surprise visitors. That said, there’s tension in the camp. You may not understand much of the Blackbird--the Harri’ar--people, but there’s an uneasiness that hangs in the air, affecting the way natives walk, talk, and to a degree, stare. It’s as if they’re afraid to show any sort of support, while at the same time afraid to show any lack of support.\n\nTrue neutrality.\n\nThey almost don’t deserve your actions. You are risking life and limb to free them from blindly following the S’umbra; but you’ve forgotten how much people like to be blindly led, a responsibility-less life where the weight of decisions are not cast upon their shoulders. It’s no way to live; despite your many wrong choices, it’s led you here, and having your life story placed on a narrow path is one of the worst fates you can imagine for a person, a life as decaying tree, absent of any branches.\n\nDinner ends up being New World rice, an unidentified type of meat, wrapped in a flat tortilla, different colorful vegetables chopped and sprinkled within. Whatever the meat is, or whatever it was seasoned with, burns like a strong whiskey in your throat. Spicy flavor isn’t exactly common in Alteran. They prefer sweetness across the pond, and your unconditioned palate causes you to take to the wine glass a little more than you planned on--but that’s how it usually works, isn’t it? At the very least, the extra cup or two or three helped against thoughts wondering what type of meat you’re eating. Some things are better left unknown.\n\nAs a foursome, you enjoy the company of one another. The unspoken fact is that it might be the last time you have the opportunity to. Tomorrow is when your plan goes into action; tonight, however, you’ll enjoy the presence of both old and new friends, a journey that began in the Old and ended, well--found itself--in the New World. There is still much journey to be had, and who’s to say that it ends here? After one chapter ends, another begins, for the story doesn’t end simply because the words THE END appear in front of you. Like a play performed on stage, THE END isn’t really that. The actors and actresses continue living, same with the audience. And afterward, the experience manifests itself within an individual, a silent but subtle whisper in the mind swaying decision and action; the same can be said for every story told, whether spoken or read.\n\nThese things shape you into who you are today, a former soldier in the New World at the center of a religious revolution with the native people of the New World. From a childhood that began in the High King’s rival nation, a dual citizenship to opposing sides of the world’s greatest superpowers, to a deserter, a champion of the Harri’ar, bondsman of Amir’sshan. Tomorrow will bring unfolding if your name is spoken with awe or accompanied with a ball of spit, the way Alterans hear the Supreme Leader’s name mentioned.\n\nYou find yourself resting atop the temple. A, you guessed it, ladder, leads from the storeroom to a trap door. You can almost see the entire war camp from the vantage point. Countless ravenlight shines in the darkness, like stars in a cloudless night. Smoke trails upward from various huts, their inhabitants warm and fed, the people that you will free from tyranny. One by one your companions drift off to sleep, taking their leave of the rooftop first starting with Redding and then Onng. All that’s left is you and E’ffy. She sits on one hip, supporting herself upright with her hands, and you, cross-legged, forearms resting on your knees. There’s no ravenlight near you, however, and the woman next to you lives in the shadows, a phantom of beauty in the night.\n\nIt’s mostly quiet. The camp’s all but winded down until morning. Blackbird warriors patrol, and that’s about it. No stranger to patrol detail, you track their cadence, their route. It’s not as rigid as militaries in the Old World. You’re pretty sure one of the warriors stopped in a certain hut for evening pleasure. It makes you wonder if they walk the streets by choice rather than by command. It’s mostly quiet. Typical sounds of the night don’t cry out here, underground. No wild animals chirp or howl at the moon. No breeze gently whistles through tree leaves. It’s simply dark and silent, absent of both moonlight and sound.\n\nYou’re content to sit and enjoy the view in silence. The vantage point overlooking the Blackbird war camp is not an experience you’ve had before, and you’re unsure if it’s one that you’ll experience again. There’s no telling what tomorrow may bring, which is not a completely unheard of statement, although you’re certain it originated from circumstances such as this, a plan set forward into motion, surely defeat meaning death. For the first time in what feels like years, maybe ever, you’re at peace. There’s a specific reassurance that comes from knowing one’s path, unencumbered by the corruption of the unknown. Rather than a faceless enemy, you know who would plant the dagger in your back, a position much more affirming than it sounds. Belly full, head tipsy. Not a bad way to spend an evening.\n\nFinally E’ffy breaks the silence. “The end draws near.”\n\nShe sure knows the right words to ruin the moment. But the priestess isn’t wrong. Perhaps it would be good to think of tomorrow and the possibilities it brings. Perhaps it would be better to simply enjoy the present moment. There’s too much planning in a lifetime, and not enough time spent in the quiet present, a fleeting thing like the wind passing by.\n\nBut still, that does not mean you have to completely ignore the upcoming confrontation. Presence doesn’t demand the forsaking of the future. It’s the means to bring you there, after all. “The end of one thing. Another will take its place.”\n\nE’ffy turns to you. Her eyes sparkle in the distant ravenlight, a shade of black, usually void of such shimmering. “Do you really believe that?”\n\n“Isn’t that the course of all things?” you ask, but then quickly continue. You’re not sure how well the native would understand the rhetoric. “Stages of life are like a wheel and people are often caught up in a specific spoke. There’s another after that. And another. And another… Removing Terr’ok and the S’umbra from their hold over the tribes is only the beginning. I--Redding and I--plan to do the same with our people who are journeying to the New World.”\n\n“There are more of you coming.” The priestess doesn’t word it as if it is a question. She probably didn’t need an explanation on the rhetoric then. “They will be sent west with the others. This is our land.”\n\n“One thing at a time, E’ffy,” you answer. “I have no doubts that your people will try. If the tribes are no longer united, though, will they have enough strength to stand against...them?” You almost said us. That, certainly, would have caused some problems.\n\n“You arrived on the latest wooden horses. How did that turn out for you?”\n\nThe arrival. Fire raining from the sky. Ships fell beneath the sea. Those who couldn’t swim, drowned. Fair enough. You voice it.\n\n“Fair enough. I was there at the garrison though, when the war party attacked the soldiers in red. They were beaten back, and that is only a garrison. Imagine if it were an entire regiment. The war party itself might not have survived. What then?”\n\n“The Raven will guide us. He always does.”\n\nYou take the chance to ask a question that’s been burning in your mind. “The artifact has something to do with the Raven, doesn’t it?”\n\nIn the shadows, you see E’ffy’s head bop up and down in response.\n\n“And the voice that speaks through it?”\n\n“Some say it is the Raven. Others say it is his son, the Raven incarnate.”\n\n“And what do you believe?”\n\nThe white of the priestess’ teeth shine in the dark. “I believe it is him. The S’umbra know it as well, and that is why they trapped Amir’sshan in his prison. They know the tribes will follow the Raven. They use his name to bring power to themselves. With Amir’sshan trapped, he can not retaliate. Until now. Until the bondsman does something about it.”\n\nThe High King of Alteran may not be a deity, although often it seems like that when speaking with a devout loyalist, but you can see the similarity. The symbolism, the similarities between the people of the New and the Old World are striking. You may practice different customs, but the same struggle for power is displayed eerily the same. All this has happened before and will happen again. Life itself is a wheel, always destined to return back to itself. Here, many thousands of miles away from Alteran, the same propaganda appears. It might as well be a billboard in an Alteran tavern wall stating You! The High King needs your service! The S’umbra use the Raven as their billboard, and the common person mindlessly follows. Without intervention it’ll continue down the path, unchanging. Until now. Until the bondsman does something about it.\n\nGot anything to say about any of this?\n(If I admit to who she says I am, does that make a difference?)\nIt makes a difference for my curiosity.\n(I won’t share just to satisfy your curiosity.)\nYou know, you’d think we’d agree a lot more being ‘bonded to one another.’\n(You’d think.)\n\n“You were quiet just now. What did Amir’sshan say?”\n\n“Oh you know, the usual. The voice thinks one way, me another.”\n\n“It is good that you are bonded.” She smiles again. “You are good for each other. The power of a god and the grounding of a man.”\n\n“Lady, if you partook in the constant inner debate, you might think otherwise.”\n\n“Show me then,” E’ffy says, scooting closer to you. She moves next to you, the edge of her arm touching yours. It’s subtle, but you both feel it. Subtle enough to claim ignorance if the other points it out. Neither does. When she speaks next, the air around you feels different, like her words themselves are imitating your touch. “Speak to me through Amir’sshan. Let me hear the Raven’s words.”\n\n(...well?)\nYou better not disappoint her.\n(I was going to tell you the same exact thing.)\n\nYou turn towards E’ffy, your face mere inches away. Her skin smells like the air before rain falls, the first refreshing breath of the morning. You draw the dagger and hold it in your palm. E’ffy places her hand around yours, her skin like liquid silver, gentle as a lover’s whisper in bed.\n\n“Are you ready?” you find yourself saying, your heart beating like the way it does before entering the battlefield.\n\nShe squeezes your hand in response, a good enough answer as any. You will the artifact to speak. It doesn’t.\n\nWell don’t begin being quiet now. That’s something you should have started days ago. The minor insult does the trick, as you knew it would.\n\n(It warms the heart to know there are still true devotees. I’ve had to put up with this fellow) You find yourself rapping your chest with a finger. (But as far as bondsmen go, I could have done a lot worse.)\n\nE’ffy’s face lights up unlike you’ve seen before. She’s one to always display her emotion. Whatever she’s feeling, you’re going to see it on her face, minus the times she’s being intentionally deceiving. The priestess does like her practical jokes. Her eyes widen to the size of a child’s when a father returns home from war, gifts in hand. Her smile becomes that of a newly-labeled fiance, the words I do still hanging in the air. E’ffy places a hand on your chest, as if feeling your heartbeat will bring her closer to her god.\n\n“We will rid the Harri’ar of the ones who trapped you here, Amir’sshan. You will reign again.”\n\nWait. What? As soon as your distrustful thought appears, it vanishes. Her hand on your chest, you can think of nothing else. No battle. No shortcoming. No fear that lies in the future. Simply, the present. The two of you on a rooftop overlooking camp, shades of ravenlight scattered before you like shells on the seashore.\n\n(And you will be by my side.)\n\nThe words flow from your mouth, not of your own volition. Before you can question it, the world starts to spin from view. Blackness rolls in from the edge of your vision, guided like a river to a waterfall. Ravenblack shades swirl, mixing with one another, twisting and distorting in front of you, like the world spinning after a hefty session at the ale house. Blackness rolls in. Just as it overtakes you completely, the artifact whispers in your mind.\n\n(It’s time you saw.)\n",
  "page 103": "Imprisoned in a world of blackness. The void called Amir’sshan’s name, and took him to a place of undeath. His body was no longer. He was the man-god, after all. His body could be destroyed the same as any, despite its youthful and inability to age. One moment the end was inevitable, peace was coming for Amir’sshan. The next, imprisonment. An endless sea of blackness to dwell within. No colors, no life. Just blackness without a comforting purple shade.\n\nFoolish Rel’sumbra!\n\nThe godkiller couldn’t destroy the soul of Amir’sshan. Years spent compiling enough ore to craft the weapon; many men paid their lives to forge the dagger. And yet Amir’sshan still lived. Curse the day! Death would not bring mercy to the former chieftain. The peace he sought escaped him, perhaps would always escape him. Ha-ha-ha… Trapped in a darkened world with only his thoughts as company, as much a depiction of hell as there’s ever been. He would have gladly chosen the lake of fire, the eternal bodily suffering. For this kind of purgatory is the worst kind: the constant exposure of one’s mind without escape. It’s Amir’sshan and the void. Amir’sshan and the void. Amir’sshan and the void. Amir’sshan…\n\nFather.\n\nSilence.\n\nFather, can you hear me?\n\nSilence.\n\nIf he still possessed a body, a grin would have appeared at the corner of his lips. If he still possessed a body, his stomach would hurt from laughter. If he still possessed a body, he would drink himself into oblivion. Ha-ha… Seemed he already found himself there without wine. Everlong darkness. Not the kind the eyes ever adjust to. There’s no shade. No contrast. He can’t even call it a sea of darkness, for a sea holds waves. Structure. His entire prison might be small, it might be larger than the world itself. Color, time, size held no meaning. Simply, darkness. He might have been here decades, centuries, minutes. Nothing held meaning. Nothing mattered. There was darkness, and there was Amir’sshan. Father Sun holds no dominion here. Simply, darkness.\n\nThen\n\nSuddenly\n\nAwareness.\n\nPhantoms appeared from nowhere. Gray, ghostly shapes like the weapons that Amir’sshan could summon. He saw the throne room. He saw Rel’sumbra standing over the fallen man-god’s body, pondering what to do next. The assassin priest’s entire life was centered on ending Amir’sshan’s life. Once he accomplished the task, what then?\n\nHe saw Rel’sumbra place the chieftain’s headdress upon his own head. For the first time, he saw his killer’s face. Rel’sumbra removed the hood that covered his face. The priest possessed angular features, the crook of his nose seemed to bring the tip of his nose below his nostrils, beak-like. His face was marked with lines of aging; the assassin looked far beyond his age. His eyes, youthful. His face, elderly--the price of dark magic, likely taking years from his life in order to feed the ancient power. By whatever means it took. If Rel’sumbra only lived a year longer--and it looked like that was a stretch--to remove Amir’sshan from power, then it gladly paid the cost. Commendable, really. Just as his allies had given their lives, so too, did their ringleader.\n\nAmir’sshan spoke from his imprisonment\n(Bondsman.)\nand bonded with the first one to wield the artifact, for even presence with his killer was preferential to loneliness with only his mind to keep him company. And soon, he would learn to despise the bondsmen, only pairing himself with the select few over the next thousands of years. But for now, upon being cast into the void, imprisoned within the artifact, he couldn’t be alone. No. Better that he had died. Better that he had been smote into non-existence. Hell was a very real place, once housed within the physical mind of Amir’sshan; now it followed him beyond death, a constant predator, a stalker in the night. And it laughed in his face.\n\nLaughed.\nLAUGHED.\nLAUGHED!\n",
  "page 102": "But he didn’t die.\n\n“Ha-ha-ha-ha...”\n\nBut he didn’t die. Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nBut he didn’t die. Ha... ha...\n\nBut he didn\u0027t die...\n\nHa-ha-ha-ha.\n\nBut he\n\nHa-ha-\nDidn’t\n\nHa. ha.\n\nDie.\n",
  "page 105": "She said it herself, the stronger one is meant to achieve victory here. Being the daughter of Malic’ant, you’re certain that E’ffy had significant training, perhaps even beyond your own. But training decays over time, a sword rusted and brittle from lack of use. Better to possess a sword of well-maintained quality rather than an initially well-crafted one, poorly handled. You shake the analogies from your mind as you take the offensive. Better is the quick cut of a surgeon, an emotionally-surgical sever than the unsure hands of a novice afraid to make a mistake. Another analogy slipped through. You make it the last, feeling the ever-familiar flow state take hold.\n\nIt’s not limited to the battlefield and forged weapons. It arrives during any fit of combat, hand-to-hand included. You may seek to end the show early, but you’d prefer to avoid knocking E’ffy out senseless. As soon as the thought appears, you almost turn back on it--a cross, designed to knock you out senseless barely misses, fired from the chieftain’s daughter. She’s quick, dangerously so, always sliding just out of reach, closing in before your defenses can fully manifest itself.\n\nAnd you realize she has to be. The woman herself can’t outmuscle you; the strength discrepancy must be even greater between her and a Blackbird, standing a full head taller than you. E’ffy fights like a floating butterfly, a hornet from a disturbed nest. You, on the other hand, stick to your training. Countless hours of drilling instilled within, emerging whenever the flow calls upon. E’ffy dances about. You cut her off. She presses. You give ground. She feints. You don’t bite.\n\nYou act like you’re moving left but then quickly switchstep to catch E’ffy unaware. Both arms find an entry, hands locking behind the woman’s torso. She’ll not break from your grasp easily. Her style only works if she never finds herself caught, pinned down, which is exactly where you take her. You use your superior strength to wrestle E’ffy to the ground, hand still clasped holding the priestess in place.\n\n“There is only one way this ends,” she whispers, too soft for anyone else to hear. “No mercy. Give no ground. Show strength.”\n\n(Knock her out.)\n\nShe’s at your mercy, held down by your grip. Knock her out? The sparring matches of Alteran end here, with one member subdued by the other. Knock her out? It’s dirty. Unsportsmanlike. The goal of sparring is to improve one another’s skills, not seeking to harm the other by any means, besides harm that naturally occurs in training, that is. Furthermore, and not that you’ve been the most chivalrous of men, but there’s the fact that E’ffy is a woman, a beautiful one at that. Something about knocking her senseless just doesn’t feel...right. You sense the eyes of Malic’ant, her father, watching your next move. It’s time to pass judgement.\n",
  "page 104": "You awaken in an unfamiliar bed. It’s nothing but a small padded mat with a single blanket spread out over your body, no frame, placed directly on the floor. You’re in a small room. Blank walls, no windows. A small fireplace is opposite of the mat, the wood that sits within blackened, small traces of embers underneath. Recently burned itself out, by the looks of it. That’s not what draws your eyes, however. E’ffy lays in front of the fireplace on her side, one arm supporting her head as a pillow. No blanket. No padding. Simply, her, the floor, and the fireplace. Not one to have poor manners, allowing a woman to take the floor while you have a “bed,” you try to remember the previous night’s events. And suddenly it rushes in: the story of Amir’sshan.\n\nThey assassinated you. Trapped you in a prison of black mithril.\n(A long time ago, yes.)\nAnd now you can enact your revenge on the cult.\n(Will you aid me in this, bondsman?)\n\nYou do not answer right away. There’s more to the artifact than being a weapon of immense power. A living being, an immortal god resides within, despite centuries--perhaps millennia--of twisted thoughts taking hold. E’ffy was right. And suddenly, it’s all clear to you. You believe. The voice within the artifact is greater than your own. Amir’sshan, the man-god, chieftain of chieftains. The two of you are bonded to one another, a mortal body and an immortal soul. Man-god. Perhaps this is the way it was always meant to be. One foot in the realm of mortality, another in the divine. It’s balance. Grounding.\n\nThe S’umbra will regret the day they turned on Amir’sshan.\n\nAmir’sshan does not answer you, but you sense the man-god’s gratitude. The two of you, though bonded, have been at odds ever since the artifact landed in your possession. The combined strength, the alignment of your minds. A relentless soldier seeking rest in battle, the battered sanity of a god. Together, Terr’ok and the S’umbra have no chance.\n\nE’ffy stirs. She sits up and looks in your direction. “You are well?”\n\nYou nod. “Amir’sshan has spoken to me. The path is set before us. We will enter the gauntlet, and the S’umbra will be no more.” You roll out of the bed. “Did you bring me here yourself?\n\nIt’s E’ffy’s turn to nod. “You were deep in the vision and you needed rest for today.”\n\n“Well...thanks.”\n\n“Come. Eat. Gather your strength. The day will be long.”\n\nIn time you would look back on those five words, the day will be long, and discover the truth of them. Now, however, you pay no mind to them and make your way to the storeroom for breakfast.\n\n---\n\nBelly full, and a few cups of tea down, you gather your equipment for the day. It’s not not much as you travel light. Your longsword is strapped in its typical spot, running from right shoulder to left hip. It doesn’t get as much use nowadays, one of the side-effects of possessing a black mithril dagger with a god’s soul trapped within. Still, you’ve kept it all this time. Dependable. Trustworthy. It’s not an extravagant weapon by any means, but it’s exactly how a sword should be. Finely crafted and doesn’t dull easily. If something were to happen to Amir’sshan--and you’re not the kind to rely on magical artifacts--you’ll be glad to have the traditional weapon, as handy as any dagger hidden in a boot.\n\nYou’ve abandoned the crimson tunic of Magda, and you’re glad for it. The shirt made you an outsider to both the Blackbirds and yourself. Not that representing your birth country is confusing to your identity; it just brings a certain uneasiness that you’d rather not weigh you down, especially not now. Bastus, Lionel, and the rest of the company probably still consider you to be traitors to the High King. With the Alteran occupation of the Magda garrison, you’re sure your traitorous position is set in stone, along with the number of gold pieces for your head. Luckily, bounty hunters aren’t running rampant in the New World as they are in the Old. That’ll change in time, you’re sure.\n\nInstead, you’ve been given a shirt woven in black thread, its shade close to raven (although not quite). It’s one of Onng’s. Any other and it’d extend down to your knees. You strap your leather armor over the top; you’re not as quick to toss the armor away even if it were given by a Magda quartermaster. On your thigh, where the Alteran flintlock used to rest, is where you leave Amir’sshan. The edge of the winged-tip grip sticks out of the leather holster, begging to be drawn, silently of course, although that can change in an instant.\n\nBelly full, and a few cups of tea down, you exit the temple.\n\n---\n\nE’ffy leads you through the war camp. She strides confidently ahead with Onng taking up the rear. It’s the silently agreed upon order of walking as it\u0027s a risk to have you or Redding on either edge. The Blackbirds seem to keep to their customs well enough, not a lawless people in the least, but there still could be a disgruntled warrior or two mourning from their defeat at the Magda garrison. Having two outsiders in their war camp offers the opportunity for retaliation, and you can’t think of a worse ending to things than suffering a mob attack. So you play the part of respectful guest, allowing E’ffy to escort you to your destination: Chieftain Malic’ant, her father.\n\nEverywhere you go, eyes follow. It’s not everyday the war camp receives visitors. You’re surprised by the amount of non-military activity happening. In the Old World, soldiers are full-time. Sure, there are other tasks to do besides battlefield training, but those are focused on military maintenance, keeping equipment clean, always ensuring the High King’s army is in tip-top shape. Here, the warriors are a mix of civilian and soldier, like a militia--almost--but without the casual approach to battle. They are fighters to the core, but they are also farmers, tradesmen, and family men. Not only do you receive their distrustful gaze from a warrior’s perspective, you also receive it from a protective father’s eyes, which is, perhaps, simply a warm-up for what awaits you at your destination. You’re about to meet E’ffy’s father, a chieftain, who will no doubt be skeptical of the “outsider” company that his daughter is keeping.\n\nLike the other buildings of the war camp, the chieftain’s structure is built in a circle of stone. Malic’ant’s hall is larger than the others. Larger, even, than E’ffy’s temple. It’s reached by a long stretch of road, ravenlight evenly spread out on either side. Blackbird warriors, their face painted in ash, stand guard outside, casually leaning on spears. Unlike the previous warriors you passed, these appear to be full-time; their job is to keep their chieftain from danger. Despite the apparent friendliness with the chieftain’s daughter, or perhaps because of that, they eye you with a disapproving gaze, more than ready and willing to jump to her defense should the tek’usan get out of line.\n\nThrough the outer line of defense you go into the main gates of Malic’ant’s hall. The inside is an open room, built around a single focus: a training pit. It’s made from dirt. Torches, real torches, line the perimeter, sending shadows to spar in the center. Behind the pit sits a throne. It’s constructed of animal bone, white jagged points jut out the way a thorn protects its ros. Resting on top is Chieftain Malic’ant. The first thing you think is--\n\n(Old.)\nI was about to say that.\n(Not out loud, I hope.)\n\nMalic’ant had certainly seen better days. To say the Blackbird’s skin is covered in wrinkles would be understating it. It’s more like his wrinkles have skin. Long, thin white hairs hang from a ring around his head, the top itself bare. Blackbirds on average stand a full head taller than an Alteran. Besides the two that escorted Terr’ok earlier, who likely stood two heads taller, Malic’ant, if he could stand and straighten his back, would be at least that. Perhaps more. Now, however, he sits with a rounded back, one hand resting on a knee for support, the other holding a feathered spear, which has likely turned into more of a walking stick in recent years.\n\n“E’ffy. Daughter,” he rumbles across the hall. His body may be failing him, but you see the life in the chieftain’s eyes, an untamed fire threatening to scorch all that stands in his way. “Who are these outsiders?”\n\n“They are our freedom,” E’ffy answers, stopping squarely in the center of the training pit. You and the others stop as well.\n\n“Are they now. And I didn’t realize I was in chains,” the chieftain dryly says. His voice is the warning of lightning, the sudden appearance of storm clouds. He is his daughter’s father. Somehow you know the mother is out of the picture.\n\n“That is the problem, is it not? The S’umbra--”\n\n“I KNOW WHY YOU’RE HERE, GIRL.” Malic’ant’s voice booms in the hall; it’s a gunshot in the night, the dagger finding a weak place in a set of armor. The chieftain quiets down. “I know why you are here. And you dishonor yourself by not holding custom.”\n\n“They are outsiders and do not hold the same.”\n\n“They are under your wing and will follow our ways.”\n\nSomehow, and this intuition comes easier than the one about E’ffy’s mother, you imagine this type of exchange happens often between the two, perhaps in cause of E’ffy’s mother. The priestess turns to you. She quickly whispers to fill you in.\n\n“I am sorry for this. Defend yourself.”\n\nThe words themselves don’t fill you in as much as the sweep that accompanies it. Her arms push you off balance, while her foot blocks you from taking a step back to keep your feet underneath your body. Instinct takes over, and as you’re falling over backward, you clutch on to E’ffy’s arm, dragging her down with you. WIth your legs wrapped around her torso to hold her into place, your arms work to isolate a limb for submission, both hands locked around a single of E’ffy’s wrist. And that’s when you learn that striking is allowed. E’ffys free arm blasts a fist into your face. Your vision sparks for a second, just enough time for you to see a second incoming punch.\n\nYou shift your weight in order to dodge the second punch, giving E’ffy the opportunity to twist from your grasp, even if the punch itself doesn’t land. The both of you find yourselves standing, facing against one another in the ring. In the corner of your eye, you see Redding and Onng have quietly excused themselves outside of the ring. Good. This is just between you and E’ffy. Chieftain Malic’ant watches intently, no doubt a legendary warrior in his time, his rule built from spoils of war. One must prove themselves worthy in order to receive an audience.\n\n“E’ffy,” you whisper. “Who’s supposed to win this?”\n\n“The one who is stronger,” she answers back, rather unhelpfully.\n",
  "page 107": "Despite your feelings, you know what must be done. The Blackbirds are a people that rely on the strong. Not only the physically strong, but those with the warrior spirit as well, those who would accomplish their task by any means necessary. For the good of the tribe, even if it’s at a personal loss. There is only way this ends, a warrior’s defeat and victory to offer to the chieftain, a symbol of the uncertainty of war. Loss and gain come hand in hand. Not one without the other. Chieftain Malic’ant is as tested as they come; and by similarity, the grit to do what must be done, as an offering, is the greatest gift you could bestow upon the chieftain. Pearls, gems, and heirlooms be damned.\n\nOne hand curls into a tight fist, the other holds E’ffy’s face into position, like readying the sacrificial animal for an altar. She looks up to you and nods her agreement. Your mind whispers an apology, desperately hoping she receives the message, as your hand lifts for the finishing blow. (It must be done.) Pain erupts through your knuckles, insignificant. E’ffy’s head snaps back. Her body crumples to the ground--or it would--but you catch her limp body and gently guide her to a comfortable prone position.\n\n“Step forward, outsider,” Chieftain Malic’ant orders. You comply.\n\nAs you reach the end of the sparring pit, movement flashes behind you. Redding and Onng rush to take care of E’ffy. Nothing permanent is likely to affect her. However, she suffered trauma to the head--and with such a blow, treatment is better sooner than later. You’ve witnessed, personally, the effects of such trauma: slurred words, reduced cognitive ability. Causing such an impairment to the priestesses, by an undeserved blow in most opinion, would be an unforgivable act in your mind. You reach the edge of the pit. Hard packed sand gives way to stone. The floor is natural cavern rock, scrapped to be smooth, although it’s not perfect. You can view more than a few ridges and bumps in the ground, nothing too extensive, although it’d be considered a mortal sin to designers in Alteran.\n\n“Closer. I’ll not bite.”\n\nYou’re not sure of the truthfulness in the chieftain’s words. Or it could be one of those technicalities. I’ll not bite, but you didn’t say anything about stabbing you with my spear! Technically correct, still the undesired outcome. You’re allowed to walk right up to the chieftain. The two large Blackbird guards stand at attention, ready to act in a moment’s notice should you act less-than-savory. Under a throne of white animal bone, tusked skulls lining the top, Malic’ant addresses you.\n\n“You are made of sturdier stuff than your countrymen. Tell me, how do you fare against them?”\n\n“Against my fellow soldiers?” you ask, quickly answering your own question. “I win more than I lose. The same can be said for the battlefield against other armies.”\n\n“Hmm,” the chieftain ponders aloud. The sound of his thinking is like the low rumble of an aftershock earthquake, the steady pour of rain clouds lingering after a storm. “You are not the greatest warrior.”\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n“Nor the quickest.”\n\nAnother shake of the head. “Or the smartest.”\n\n(Some points are proven in the words themselves.)\n\n“Hmm.” Malic’ant’s grip tightens around the spear. The speartip protrudes from a shaft of many feathers, from underneath a makeshift wing, if you will. “Not the strongest or the quickest or the smartest. Tell me, outsider, what do you offer then?”\n\n(Time to dance. What shall I be? Six-shooter, sword?)\nNothing.\n(What, you think you have something to offer besides me?)\nYou picked me despite a lack of magical artifact. Are you telling me you didn’t see anything?\n(They call me the mad-god for a reason.)\nYou hate that name.\n(I do.)\nMalic’ant respects the strength of the individual.\n(And you defeated a woman in battle. You possess strength, indeed.)\nNo easy foe. Likely trained by the chieftain himself.\n(That’s not enough to impress the man though.)\nI know, I know. Thinking.\n(Think quicker. We’ve been--)\n\n“Silence caught your tongue?” Malic’ant breaks the inner dialogue with Amir’sshan. Your companions are used to the gap in responses when Amir’shan speaks. Others aren’t.\n\n“Apologies, Chieftain,” you respectfully answer. “Amir’sshan speaks to me in moments such as this.”\n\n“It is true then. You are the bondsman. You possess a weapon greater than any of the Harri’ar. That is your offering, then?”\n\n“No, Chieftain,” you respond back. “The weapon is merely a tool. (Hey, now...) I would not offer something that another can merely take from my grasp. That is the same as equating my strength to the armor strapped around my body or the warriors that I call an ally.”\n\n“Go on,” the chieftain says, interest in his voice.\n\n“I am not the strongest, physically. Nor do I possess the mind to outthink my opponents at every turn. Yet Amir’sshan chose me for the bond; the man-god saw an unrelenting spirit, one that never strays from the path. I’m an arrow, Chieftain, set upon its course, fired true. There’s no going back once the bowstring is released. I’ll not hit my target unless plucked from the sky itself. And in order to do so, those must answer to Amir’sshan. I will do what is necessary to achieve victory, even if that means striking my own...ally,” you call E’ffy that for lack of a better term.\n\nChieftain Malic’ant doesn’t answer. Instead, he rises from his skeletal throne, both hands leaning on the spear for support. The guards behind him don’t flinch, but you can tell they’re ready to rush to their chieftain’s aid should his decrypted bones fail him. Interesting, isn’t it? He rests on a throne built from others’ bones, yet his own seek to betray him. Such is the course for all, however, and not all conquer the amount Malic’ant has during their time.\n\nEven with an arched back the chieftain towers above you. A weathered face examines yours, wisdom in Malic’ants eyes, the kind that is born from experience, the kind that outvalues all others. “Ask something of me and I will grant it. I give you my word as chieftain.”\n\nIt strikes you that you could ask for anything, wealth, comforts, the hand of his daughter in union. All far short to the mission; they’re but minor distractions pulling you from greatness. There’s a task to accomplish, first starting with the native people of the New World then moving to the Old. With your answer, you seal in every unanswered question of doubt, smiting away all that takes you from the path. “We are challenging Terr’ok and the S’umbra by the trial of the old ways, to run the gauntlet of the gods and challenge the S’umbra’s champion. We need your support.”\n\n“And you shall have it,” Malic’ant affirms, slamming the butt of his spear into the stone floor for emphasis. “You shall have it.”\n\nWith Malic\u0027ant’s support, you gained the right to challenge Terr’ok by the old ways. Yet you need more. The chieftain brought support from the tribe; the gauntlet will bring support from the gods. For a people so obviously devoted to the Raven, you’re a bit surprised to hear of other gods existing. Amir’sshan only made sense because of his alternate reference, the Raven incarnate. According to E’ffy, there are many in the Harri’ar’s religion. The Raven is above all, but another, subtier of gods exist, including figures that turned Alteran tavern rumors and borderline stereotypes into reality, gods such as the sun, earth, etc.\n\nThe chieftain dispatched one of his warriors to call a meeting of the tribe’s leaders, which consisted itself of chieftains puppeteering under the S’umbra and Malic’ant. No one challenged Mali’cant’s backing. They didn’t lend additional support, however, but no one openly disagreed with the legendary warrior. Respect, honor: it lasts far longer than the brittle bones of man. The Harri’ar are not a people bound by the sundial. They live lives free from the constraints of mankind’s contribution to tracking time. They call the trial to happen that very day. If, indeed, the Harri’ar are being led by the wrong leader, then change needs to happen immediately; the gauntlet will determine if that’s the case.\n\nYour body timer, speaking of time, tells you it’s just past midday, despite the lack of natural sunlight in the war camp. As the one who made an audience with Malic’ant, and the bondsman of Amir’sshan, you’ll be the one running the gauntlet. No surprise there. They painted your face in ash and stripped you of all armor, minus something called an a’lta, a blanket-like garment wrapped around your waist. On your head, a headdress of feathers was placed, only all the feathers have been plucked. The result is a headdress of spikes, white thorny stems that usually hid underneath the comfort of its feathers. You are allowed to keep your weapons, though, which includes Amir’sshan. Shirtless, face marked with ash, they set you upon the path, into the mouth of the cave: the gauntlet of the gods.\n",
  "page 106": "You lie in wait for E’ffy’s attack. No stranger to combat, you know a taunt when you hear one. Who is supposed to win? The one who is stronger. If you’re discerning the exchange correctly, then E’ffy is seemingly attempting to get you to charge in. And why wouldn’t she? Blackbird warriors stand a full head taller than the average Alteran. With the added size, comes added strength. If the priestess, daughter of the chieftain, was raised in that environment, then of course she wants you to be the aggressor.\n\nYou stand out of striking distance from her, arms raised defensively. She does the same, stalking you like a jungle cat, looking for an opening to pounce. At the end of the hall, you sense Malic’ant’s eyes, watching intently. Whether he views the “custom” from an honorable chieftain or proud father, you know not. Perhaps a bit of both, which makes you even more uneasy about the whole circumstance. Sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don’t situation. You’ve found yourself in plenty worse, and you managed to escape those without too much of an issue. This’ll be the same. You continue to wait patiently, letting your mind take the reins, despite the body’s longing to rush into battle. E’ffy seems to do the same. Then, her mind folds to the urge of battle.\n\nShe charges in, swingingly first with the left, then with the right. Easily recognized. The left is to set up the power right. Your feet guide you just beyond reach of the power shot. As her right hand barely misses, you fire a foot into the woman’s gut. The sole of your foot lands squarely in E’ffy’s lower stomach, doubling her over. You don’t follow up, however. Patience has guided you this far, and you’ll lean on her again. The blow, damaging physically, is more damaging to the ego. From when you first met E’ffy, you’ve learned that her emotions guide her, often changing like the weather. Sunny one moment, cloudy the next. Watch out for storm clouds. The way she fights is no different; it’s who she is.\n\nNow it’s your turn to taunt. You motion with both hands, come on. It brings the desired effect. E’ffy’s face narrows as she charges towards you, just as expected. Again, you slide back out of reach and--\n\n--take a hook, one to the body and one to the head. At the last possible moment, the priestess shifted her weight, turning like a nimble ship on the water, and cutting off your backstep, closing into striking range before you had a chance to raise a defense. The punches stun you for a second. More importantly, they wake you up to the reality set before you. The Blackbird people earn respect by a show of strength. It doesn’t matter if the skirmish is between a man or a woman, something that would be unheard of in the Old World. Two warriors face each other, and the stronger will come out victorious. The relationship between the woman and the chieftain doesn’t matter at this moment. Neither does potential hurt feelings. Not even the S’umbra matters at this moment. There’s battle and the path to victory. That’s it.\n\nWith your new-found thoughts, you enter the flow state. Your mind becomes a distant ally; your body does as it’s spent countless hours training to do. Every movement from E’ffy causes a reaction from you. Her strikes are blocked or dodged, each one bringing a counter from your own arsenal. The tide turns quickly. You may not be as strong, physically, as a Blackbird warrior, but you possess strength beyond average for your size, speed nearly on par with E’ffy’s. You catch her with a hook to the body, payback for earlier. She doesn’t recover immediately like you did. The opening is there if you take it.\n",
  "page 55": "Like your dream on board the Devastator, you become a third party witness watching the scene of your younger self. You float above your body, unable to control the events happening below. Your body wears the gray robes of your class rank, still absent of lines. It doesn’t get any lower than gray with no lines. Luckily, you aren’t alone in that regard, although the other childrens’ fathers aren’t up for re-election for Judicator.\n\nYour younger self walks alongside another boy, Prinn, both of you on the short side for your age. His golden curls reach down his forehead just enough to touch the top of his, similarly golden, spectacles, causing the boy to have a consistent habit of touching his face, either to adjust his glasses or sweep his hair from his eyes. Like you, Prinn wears a gray robe, although his is decorated with three purple lines sewn into the shoulder. Top rank.\n\n“Isn’t Master Gavin’s lecturing just fascinating?” Prinn exclaims. “He breaks down the subject like a surgeon, cutting only as deep as necessary. It makes the assigned reading all the better, familiarity without redundancy.”\n\nAlong the path, one that you know well, a stretch of dirt that runs through an area of the school’s well-landscaped forest, you turn to face Prinn. “Of all the words to describe Master Gavin’s class, ‘fascinating’ is last on the list.”\n\n“Yeah, you’d know all about that, huh?”\n\n“Funny.”\n\n“I thought so.” Prinn turns more serious. “Listen, if you need help…”\n\n“Not this again,” you cut him off. “Studying doesn’t interest me. Although I’m sure my father would throw a feast if I asked him to hire a professional tutor.”\n\n“So you’d get good food and raise your status in the class. Seems like a no-brainer to me. No offense or anything.”\n\n“No offen--” you start to question, then realize his meaning. “Damn you, Prinn.”\n\nYou walk in silence for a few steps. The school campus is built with modern design, tall many windowed buildings, yet there are many small sections of forest that still remain, as if warning Mother Nature herself that she could be conquered and contained. Most, like this one, have small trails known to a few students. Sure as hell beats walking around. Sturdy oak rises around you, their leaves attempting to resist autumn’s invading color.\n\nA voice rings out in the air, different from yours or Prinn’s. “Well, well. What do we have here? The runt and his bookbag carrier.”\n\nFrom behind a tree, three boys step in front of you, the one who spoke, Kelle, the ringleader, stands almost an entire head taller than Prinn and you, as is the case for most boys who hit their growth spurt early. His black hair is shaved close, arm displaying two purple lines.\n\n“Are you lost, Kelle?” Prinn says, adjusting his glasses. “Perhaps looking for a higher test score…”\n\n“In a manner of speaking. I assume you’ve finished tomorrow’s assignment for Master Gavin?” Kelle takes a step towards the two of you.\n\n“What do you think,” Prinn states rather than framing a question.\n\n“I think it’s in your best interest to...study with me. Compare notes.” After a nod, Kelle’s two goons, boys whose names you’ve forgotten, lunge to grab at Prinn. With a yelp far less confident than his quips, Prinn attempts to duck from their grasp. Heat rushes through your body, a white burning within. It spreads, and you feel small beads of sweat begging to appear on your forehead.\n\nYou fan the flame.\n\nInstead of helping Prinn, you focus on the ringleader. It’s no secret that academics aren’t your strong suit, but you’ve learned at least one thing from Master Gavin’s biology lectures: sever the head and the body dies. Your younger self charges straight into Kelle, your shoulder planting into his gut. The force of the blow causes a reactive gasp from the boy’s lips. The two of you go sprawling on the forest floor, dirt kicking up with your impact.\n\nAs soon as you hit the ground, you fire a fist into Kelle’s exposed face. The strike causes his head to snap back and hit the ground beneath him. Before you can land another, his two goons wrap up your arms and force you to your feet, well, to an upright position; they hold you in the air so your feet are barely grazing the forest floor. Kelle, now with a smile, stands on his own strength. A line of blood runs down the side of his face, mixing with dirt. His gray robe is stained. Yours is likely its match.\n\n“Wait, we can exchange notes!” Prinn yells from behind you.\n\n“Yes we will,” Kelle comments, mindlessly. His attention is focused on you. “After I teach a lesson of my own. Perhaps you’ll learn something today after all, no-stripe.”\n\nHis fist hits you in the center of your body, just between where the rib cage is connected. You feel like a bird in flight suddenly losing its feathers, the air taken from you--no longer an ally. Before you can even make sense of the analogy, another blow lands in the exact same place. You would crumple over, you would have from the first punch, but the two goons continue to hold you up. All you muster is a cough as you try to fill your lungs back up with air.\n\nFloating above, watching your young body be beaten, you can think of several avenues of attack. Headbutt to stun, explode in movement, focusing to free one of your arms, then using that arm on the offensive. Instead, you watch another punch land, the memory, the emotional tie is almost physically felt. Watching the scene overhead, you take deliberate breaths, the air suddenly feeling rather thin.\n\nFootsteps.\n\nThey trample through the forest in heavy stomps. Twigs snap. Leaves are ruffled. The shape of a man appears through the trees. Kelle and his goons drop you to the dirt, taking off in the opposite direction, not before throwing a last threat your way.\n\n“We’ll continue the ‘lecture’ later!”\n\nPrinn does his best to catch you, but he is neither quick nor strong. You feel the full impact along with your friend awkwardly trying to help. You push his hands away in response, moving to stand on your own, your right arm clutching at your stomach. Vladimir, your father’s man, appears, the one who was stomping towards your one-sided skirmish.\n\n“Young master. Prinn,” he speaks.\n\n“Some timing you have,” Prinn answers, pushing a curl from his eyes. “I’ll see Kelle expelled for this.”\n\n“No you won\u0027t.”\n\nPrinn glances at Vladimir, surprised.\n\nVladimir answers. “If our young master here (he nods toward you) can’t keep up with his studies, then his brawn should make up for his ‘brains,’ for lack of a better term. That is spinnable. Failing in the classroom and failing with schoolmate brawls, well, such a thing is best left hidden.”\n\n“But Kelle can’t be allowed to get away with it,” Prinn says as you pull yourself up without his help.\n\n“He won’t,” you speak in a voice a little louder than a whisper, the intake of air still difficult. “Do you trust me, Prinn?”\n\nHe nods and adjusts his glasses.\n\n“Good. This is what we must do…”\n\nVladimir pretends not to hear you. He walks back towards the direction he arrived. After a few steps he stops and speaks without turning around. “Young master. Remember what I said. Do not allow anything to trace back to you or your father. He is up for reelection. After all, the people of Magda expect their Judicator to have his family in line.”\n",

  "page 54": "The hallway opens into a large chamber, carved in a round shape. There is not a single corner to the walls; they wrap around the center like a banner twisting in the wind. Here, there are more ravenlight torches on the wall, so you abandon the one you carry, placing it on one of the hooks designed--at least you assume that’s their use--for easy placement of torches for those wandering the halls.\n\nThe very center of the room boasts a sizable sarcophagus, larger than any of the others you encountered before. The room is built on a slope, a series of stone steps, leading to the resting place. Unlike the ones encountered before, the lone sarcophagus is intricately engraved, covered completely with writing unknown to you. There’s a weighty silence that accompanies the chamber, one that is felt inwardly, one that makes your heartbeat sound like war drums.\n\n“Care to explain why the dead rise from their graves?” you whisper to Redding.\n\n“Protectors of the artifact,” is his reply.\n\n“...that’s it?”\n\nRedding turns to face you. “Fine. They’re ancient rulers, each a former possessor of the artifact. Their soul was given in service, so here, even in death they serve to protect the artifact from falling into the wrong hands. Our hands. They’re buried with their lifemates--that’s why there are two resting places created on top of each other. They’re bound to protect the artifact together, lest the souls of their lineage be forfeit. Happy now?”\n\nA fabricated story if you ever heard one. It’s too perfect. A good lie must have an aspect of being a lie, along with elements of truth, of course. Stories can’t address every question. That’s the sign of someone who knows they’ll be prodded--and the preparation made beforehand. Still, it’s a little satisfying if you’re being honest.\n\nYou nod. “Of course.”\n\nRedding stares at you a moment before turning his head back to the lone grave. “What? My most curious soldier doesn’t have any follow on questions? I bet there are a million things running through your mind right now.”\n\n“Two million, actually,” you whisper. “But they aren’t important right now. If we escape this place with our lives, rest assured we’re going to have a long talk.”\n\n“When we escape this place, I’ll answer every single one, and I’ll buy the first round.\"\n\n“First two rounds, you mean.”\n\n“Fine. First two.” He asks again. “Happy?”\n\n“As a nobleman with aged Alteran brandy.”\n\n“Good,” Redding says. “The artifact awaits us.”\n\nYour footsteps disturb the hanging silence. You can’t help but count each one, twenty-three in total. The stone sarcophagus sits in front of you. It’s made from a similar dark stone as the others, although it appears to have more of a sparkle. Upon further examination, there is some sort of crystal infused with the stone. They shimmer in tiny specks as if ground crystal was mixed with flowing magma, then shaped to its square shape. At least that’s your best un-educated guest. In reality, it could be something entirely different. Magic, perhaps.\n\n“Help me with this,” Corporal Redding says, gripping the stone lid with both hands. You do the same, standing opposite of him. It resists at first, and then gives way to your combined strength. With a grinding screech, one that disturbs the silence far greater than your footsteps, the lid slides from its closed position, one end landing on the ground, the other remaining posted against the sarcophagus at a diagonal angle.\n\nNo sooner than the lid hits the ground, a soft thunderclap echoes, the sound completely different than stone hitting the floor. Sound in a visible wave expands from the sarcophagus, as if the ripple of a rock thrown into a pond. Instantly, the ravenlight torches extinguish, sending the room into a darkness far greater than that of any night. Something pierces your mind, nothing you’ve ever felt before. It’s as if someone were tapping your mind with an impatient finger, waiting for your thoughts to catch up.\n\nDarkness abounds. You lose yourself to the void.\n",
  "page 108": "When it comes down to it, you aren’t like them. There wouldn’t be a single Blackbird warrior in the camp to make the decision you’re about to. E’ffy’s completely at your mercy, and you don’t finish her off. It’s not the way you treat an ally. On the field of battle, there’s no mercy. Simply, it can not exist if death is to be escaped. Here, however, there’s room for it; need for it, a trust that’s built between fellow members.\n\nInstead of ending the skirmish with a single blow, you hold back.\n\nVisible anger appears on her face. E’ffy’s mouth becomes a tight slit, eyes following closely in the shape. The redness on her face, a subtle shade of crimson, begins to glow brighter, adding to the physical proof of exertion. The whites of her eyes expand, nostrils flared.\n\n“That is a mistake, bondsman,” she utters.\n\n(I whole-heartedly agree.)\n\nWith a cry, she then takes the offensive against you. E’ffy charges forward, arm cocked back to throw all of her weight and momentum into a single punch. You welcome it. Best to let the woman take her aggression out, even if her aggression might take the form of a bruise on your cheek the next day.\n\n“STOP!”\n\nChieftain Malic’ant’s voice stops E’ffy mid-step, like the wind was taken out of her sails, the anchor dropped at the exact same moment. She stops, turns, and faces her father. You remain where you are, noticing Redding and Onng watching from a distance. The chieftain’s hall becomes silent as any grave, as any morning after burying the dead the day before.\n\n“Step forward, outsider,” the chieftain orders. You comply. It takes exactly twelve steps to reach the other side of the training pit towards Malic’ant. With a half grunt-half groan of annoyance, the large Blackbird stands to his feet, pulling himself upright with his spear, at the same time waving off his royal guard, or whatever the chieftain protectorate is called. Crippled from age, Malic’ant still towers above you. Standing in his shadow is like finding a great oak in the midday of summer.\n\n“You showed my daughter mercy,” he flatly growls.\n\nYou find yourself nodding. “She is not my enemy, a worthy opponent, however.”\n\n(Suck up.)\n\nChieftain Malic’ant ponders a moment. His hand raises to scratch at his chin, the other remains firmly grasped around his spear. Up close, the spear is razor sharp, expectedly so. Feathers line the top, sending the blade protruding from underneath a wing, a common analogy for the Harri’ar. Malic’ant’s eyes scan you for signs of deception, the look every father gives his daughter’s guest, especially that of a male variety.\n\n“You do not have my blessing.”\n\nBehind you, E’ffy spits on the ground. She doesn’t look surprised, however. She must have known the path your actions set you upon. Onng wears a similar expression; Redding, oddly enough, looks disinterested. His mind is made up either way. Having the blessing of the Blackbird people is simply a formality in his mind. Whether having the backing of E’ffy’s father, he’s still going to take the fight to the S’umbra.\n\nAfter all of this, the struggle that you’ve undergone, making yourself enemies of both superpowers in the Old World, to find yourself here, at E’ffy’s father’s hut denied, sends more than a single thought of rage into your mind. Not to E’ffy’s extent, but you’ve not exactly shown a containment over passion yourself. The two of you are similar in that way, yet one is but a sliver of the other.\n\n“And just why is that?” you find yourself saying.\n\n“You do not hold the strength to do what is necessary,” the chieftain says. “You have skill, yes. But in the moment when action was required most, you did not do what needed to be done.”\n\n“It’s your own daughter!”\n\n“AND YOU SHAME HER BY NOT GIVING A WARRIOR’S DEFEAT.”\n\nDespite the lower volume, his next words seethe with more rage than the words shouted.\n\n“Bondsman or no, you do not have what it takes. Find another’s support.”\n\nYou know there’s not a single other chieftain in the war party that would lend support. The ability to defeat the S’umbra by lawful ways ends here. You’ve still got Amir’sshan and Redding who would die fighting by your side. E’ffy, you know, won’t approve of any unlawful means. Breath still occupies your lungs, but you’ve found yourself strayed from the path. Your journey may still continue, but among the path of the storyteller, it dies here.\n",
  "page 57": "“Kid?\n\nSilence.\n\n“Kid, wake up. We’re in some shit.” Corporal Redding slaps your face lightly. Your senses are lost, seemingly floating just from your grasp. The slap brings a small fuzziness, the feeling of sleeping on a limb all night. Another slap. Harder this time. The second one helps put things in order, a sharp stinging where the fuzziness was felt. Sight comes next. Corporal Redding’s scraggly beard is inches away from your face, examining your eyes for signs of life. Behind him, the accuracy of his statement settles.\n\nDark raven light in long ribbon-like strands fly across the tomb, filling the place in the glow of dusk, the torches remaining unlit. Light, instead, pours from within the open sarcophagus, its origin. Ravenlight spirals in the air with a soft whistle--one that appears to be picked up one ear at a time, twisting, braiding with one another, a dark purple web with two Alteran soldiers caught at its center.\n\nA shadow hangs heavy in the midst of the ravenlight. The shape of a human body rises from the open sarcophagus, floating in the air the way one would casually lay on lake water, as if an unseen rope binds the body from the waist. It’s in the shape of a man. Hard to tell at first with long strands of black hair, although the shoulders are too broad to be a woman’s. The floating shadow slowly turns upright, like a man sliding out of bed in the morning, his feet hanging mere inches over the sarcophagus.\n\nDead, black orbs for eyes meet yours. His skin looks as if it’s barely attached to his face, as if a quick turn of the head would result in its undoing. The figure is dressed in a tattered robe, purple and black, the robe itself shaped like a swordpoint at the bottom, a gold medallion resting at his chest in contrast to the dark robes beneath. Wrinkly fingers, long lost their healthy color, grip around a wooden staff, carved to proudly display a raven at the top. Like the others, an empty hole sits where a mouth should be, the bottom jaw detached and lost long ago.\n\nA Blackbird high priest, a shaman. A Blackbird lich.\n\n“I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” you utter, feeling those seven words sum up the situation perfectly.\n\nWho disturbs the hallowed halls. Who calls the dead from their sleep.\n\nThe lich shows no indication of speaking. His voice simply...is, a deep rumbling like a thousand boots marching to war, like the warning grumble of a volcano before erupting. The lich doesn’t phrase his words in a question. There’s no inflection; each word resonates exactly the same as the others, like the steady groan of the undead.\n\n“It’s simple, really. Is there more than one reason anyone would venture here?” Corporal Redding answers, drawing his sword. The lich doesn’t respond to the obvious threat. Perhaps that’s his nature. Perhaps he doesn’t see one.\n\nTo visit the famed resting place and find inspiration for one’s life.\n\nWas that humor? It’s hard to tell with the lich’s featureless demeanor. You could see it as such, although it could be the case that liches are over-the-top serious, a trait likely caused by binding one’s soul to an eternity between life and death, unable to die, yet not quite alive. Yeah, if you took such binding, you’d probably speak in the same manner.\n\n“We’re not here for inspiration,” Redding affirms.\n\nAh. So be it. I accept your challenge, outsider. You will soon join the bones of those who have tried before you. You will be another body lost in a sea, no grave to your name, no memory of your passing. What you think is honorable is nothing more than grasping at the wind.\n\n“You’re mistaken again,” Corporal Redding says. “There’s no honor here. Only the grim reality of what must be done. Now, kid!”\n\nYour hand is resting by your side, feigning a calm demeanor. Hidden underneath is tension, building, stored energy ready to be released. The trick is keeping a blank face--any duelist will tell you that--a slate wiped of all emotion, unwavering. Your expressionless face carefully watched the words spoken between Corporal Redding and the Blackbird lich. Your hand, itching for movement. Your flintlock, desperate to play.\n\nThe familiar grip is placed against your palm.\n\nThe hammer’s distinct click rings into the tomb.\n\nYour eyes are focused on the target, the small amount of space between the lich’s endless-black eyes. He floats just above the sarcophagus, a direct shot. Your eyes do not leave your target, not when you draw the flintlock, not when you press down the hammer, not even as your arm moves to firing position. There lies only the target and your shot. Cool metal presses against the inside of your pointer finger, the trigger pleading to join the fun. You oblige. It takes little more than the strength to scratch your head, the strength required to pluck at a lute. How easily death can come.\n\nFor an instant the tomb’s ravenlight is joined by another source, a small spark, then fiery reddish-orange combustion, followed by black gunfire smoke. Before the hole appears at the lich’s forehead, you know the shot to be true. There’s a feeling that accompanies perfect aim, a premonition of sorts that’s brought about by the muscle memory of countless fires. Any small deviation is felt, a stickiness of the holster, trigger pulled too soon. There is nothing of the sort here. Only pure marksmanship.\n\nOne moment the lich floats above the sarcophagus. The next, a round hole appears between its eyes.\n\nOne moment the lich floats above the sarcophagus. The next, it crashes down, hitting the side wall of the sarcophagus, then collapsing to the tomb floor in a heap of robe, its staff flung from grasp.\n\nOnly then do you allow your gaze to wander. It finds Corporal Redding, who meets your eyes with his own. He doesn’t speak, and neither do you. Redding walks to the fallen lich, blade still drawn. He raises it overhead, and for an instant the lich’s body twitches, a small movement, perhaps as it looks to regather its strength. Redding’s sword cuts down, severing head from body. The lich’s head rolls on the floor a moment before resting against the base of the sarcophagus, gaping hole for a mouth facing you.\n\n“Well,” you break the silence. “What now?”\n\n“Now we take the artifact,” Corporal Redding replies, stepping over the fallen lich to peer inside the sarcophagus. Curious, you follow closely behind him. Peering inside, your eyes take a second to adjust. It’s dark, unnaturally so. A single item lies inside, small of size. Corporal Redding snatches it up with one hand.\n\n“Are you sure that’s safe?” you ask.\n\n“Kid, nothing in the New World is safe.”\n\nFair enough.\n\nYour attention draws to the item in Redding’s palm. The artifact is in the form of a small dagger. Its hilt is ravenblack and wing-shaped, the point sharper than any talon. The blade itself is a midnight black as if attempting to meld into the shadow cast by the hilt. But still, it’s a dagger. How can Redding expect a dagger, even a deadly one, to turn the tide of the war? You can’t help but voice the thought. At least your mouth opens, the words ready to flow, when Redding beats you to it. Your thoughts must have shown on your face.\n\n“Trust me. This is no ordinary dagger.”\n\n“How so?”\n\nRedding gives you a patented grin. “You’ll see.”\n\nGreat.\n\n“Come on,” Redding gestures with the dagger. “The others must be done with their task by now. We have what we came here for, thanks to you.”\n\nYou twirl the flintlock around your finger before sliding it back into the holster at your thigh. “Another day in the life…” You turn to leave, Redding by your side.\n\n(This day is not done with surprises quite yet.)\n\n“What did you say?” you ask Redding.\n\n“What? I didn’t say anything,” is his answer.\n\nUndead rising from their graves, liches, and now voices: you’re damn glad to leave the place. Never before have you looked forward to returning to a military camp. You could use an ale, perhaps a little music, and a full night’s rest. Bad things supposedly happen in threes. Luckily the same holds true for the good.\n",
  "page 56": "(A man far from home. A traitor within their midst.)\nI’m no traitor!\n(And they’ll believe you? Your blood is their enemy.)\nI’ve served them well enough. My actions speak for themselves.\n(I sense you’re barely convincing yourself, let alone Alteran.)\nIt’ll have to do.\n",
  "page 59": "No, you dare not attempt any sort of rescue. The lives of the company aren’t in any danger. As such, it would be the most selfish thing you could do in the current situation. You would be, essentially, putting their lives at risk in exchange for a pardon in Alteran. How could you face your countrymen, returning back to serve by their side, after doing such a thing. No. The best thing for your fellow soldiers, bound, is to play the part, keeping the lives of the company higher than that of your own.\n\nThe soldiers form up. There are 17 of them total, including Alexander, which means there are 16 under his command. A few more men than in a typical Alteran company. From what you know about the two superpowers, Alteran boasts more overall soldiers. It wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for their numbers to be grouped at a higher number than Magda, although that’s not the case--that difference is made up with the sheer number of companies, units, battalions, garrisons, etc. Smaller-knit groups of soldiers learn to work well together, and that cohesion is kept as the High King’s commanders piece them together.\n\nYour mind draws to the scenario of a revolt. Outnumbered, outmatched. It likely wouldn’t go well. Patience. There’ll be a time for confrontation, and you’d rather it be when the soldiers of Magda think you among them, docile, like a declawed pet. The soldiers of Magda line up, four rows of four. Alexander takes the front along with Redding. They motion for you to join them. Putting on your best friendly face, you join them.\n\n(Like a declawed pet, indeed.)\n\nThere it is again, the voice. You decide to answer back, in your head, of course. The situation is already dicey enough without you convincing both friendly and enemy soldiers alike that you’re not quite right in the mind.\n\nWho’s there? Can you hear me?\n\nSilence for a moment. You begin to feel like a fool. Then, a response.\n\n(Quite the interesting conundrum you’ve found ourselves in.)\nOurselves?\n(You and I are in this together. So, yes, ‘ourselves.’)\nWho are you?\n(You’ll find out soon enough.)\n\nWith that the voice goes silent, and honestly, you’re glad of that fact. You march at the front, knowing exactly what it signifies. It means you\u0027re technically the superiors of the Magda soldiers that fall in line behind you, or at the very least you’re considered a “guest,” “ally,” whatever--the soldiers can’t cross you without disobeying their commanding officer. The Magda company, along with yours, tied up and bound, travel through the overgrowth of the New World.\n",
  "page 58": "You travel the way you came. Back through the hall, stepping over the dead, keeping a steady eye on the fallen to make sure they don’t rise again. Once is enough for you. In the small religious room, you place the ravenlight torch back on the hook where you found it. How polite. How civilized. Two steps into the tunnel, you undo the good deed, needing the light to guide you back to the ladder. There’s no sense in wasting another match or two.\n\nCorporal Redding volunteers to take the ladder first, which you take no argument with. You slump down, back against the tunnel wall, and pause a moment while he climbs up. It’s hard to formulate thoughts on what you just experienced. Necromancy is not unheard of. It’s rare, sure, but it’s not something of myth or fable. It’s just what you weren’t expecting from the natives. The stories in Alteran made them out to be large beasts without the knowledge or intellect for such magic. That’s two occasions now, counting the voyage landing. Mentally you agree to block out such stories going forward. They can only result in underestimating your enemy, something many dead men are guilty of.\n\nMid-thought the rope ladder suddenly sways back and forth. You shelve your thoughts for another time. Now you need to focus on climbing. It’s not a difficult task, but you’d rather remain in the present moment to prevent a fall resulting in broken bones, or worse. Just as you came down, you intentionally go slowly to preserve strength and endurance. After several minutes, you reach the top. An outstretched palm greets you at the top, thrust through the square amount of sunlight shining through the open trap door. Palm meeting palm, you allow Corporal Redding to pull you up.\n\nOnly it’s not Corporal Redding. You arrive face-to-face with a soldier of Magda. Magda, the territory at the High King’s heel.\n\nIn contrast to the long blue overcoat of the Alteran soldier, the soldiers of Magda wear deep crimson tunics, tucked into their pants to allow for their steel breastplates to shine magnificently. You see, their hearts belong to Supreme Leader Fargrave (spit), and they will make sure their leader’s property is well defended. To that effect, each wears a small hand buckler at their waist to pair with a broadsword resting on the opposite hip. This man in particular has sharp features, thin nose, a thin chin seemingly trying to stretch away from his face. His brown hair is slicked back and tied at the base of his neck.\n\nIn reaction to seeing your country’s rival, you allow your other hand to greet the man in return, although yours is in the form of a fist to his jaw. The man crumples to the ground. It’s then that you see the rest of the company bound by rope, more soldiers standing guard nearby. Bastus appears to enjoy your shot, despite the cloth gag tied at his mouth, the approval written in his eyes. Good. At least they’re still alive. Can the same be said for…\n\nCorporal Redding.\n\nHe’s engaged in discussion with the Madga superior officer, showing off the artifact. Since you know the man, you can tell he’s doing his best not to hand over the artifact, subtly gesturing with the dagger as if it were in the hands of the officer. Then again, can you really claim that you know the man? First, the deception with the company. Second, the apparent friendliness towards the soldiers of Magda. Hopefully that’s it. A betting man might toss money towards a third.\n\nYou briefly entertain the idea of drawing your flintlock and firing upon the soldiers. As quickly as the thought appears, it vanishes. You know how that story ends. Two, maybe three soldiers would go down with you. Now’s not the time or place for such heroics. Besides, after the left hook, the soldiers seem to rest their hands a little closer to the hilt of their broadswords. Plus, the High King never gave permission. A punch is excusable. Even a duel with swords is. But outright killing? No, that’s against the rules of civilized war, especially when the Alteran leader hasn’t declared it in the first place. When struggles happen between Alteran and Magda in the Old World, the import and export of POWs become their main business, minus the factories creating weapons of war, of course.\n\nThe soldier you hit rises from the ground, anger visible on his face, one that is turning a crimson to match his tunic. His arm cocks back to return fire. His emotions cause him to wind up, something that all hand-to-hand combat instructors warn against. It’s the easiest punch in the world to dodge, brought upon by untempered emotion and the desire to knock an opponent the fuck out. Such techniques, if you can call it that, are only effective when set up with another strike or with your opponent stunned, dazed, or bound.\n\nTwo sturdy hands grab for each of your arms simultaneously, reminding you, again, of a childhood memory, pinning them against your body, soldiers unseen from behind you. You manage to twist your head to soften the blow, but it still hits, glancing off your cheek. If the man wasn’t angry before, he sure as hell is now, clearly noticing your ability to slip from the solid punch. He winds up again, another slow telegraph, but it’s not like you’re going anywhere.\n\n“That’s enough!”\n\nThe man speaking to Corporal Redding silences the skirmish with two words. Instantly, the soldiers release your arms, the one in front of you bringing both hands to his sides, although you notice his fists are still clenched. The apparent leader of the Magda soldiers walks forward. He’s a large man, but not overly so, possessing natural strength while, perhaps, not displaying the physique in a cut manner. In contrast to Redding’s scraggly beard, the man has his trimmed short and neat, matching the way his black hair is styled.\n\n“These are our guests, Benjamin. Our allies.”\n\nBenjamin, the soldier you hit protests. “But he struck first!”\n\n“Merely startled him is all,” Corporal Redding interjects, much to the obvious disapproval of the leader. “The fault lies with me for not warning him ahead of time.”\n\n“Is that so?”\n\nCorporal Redding now has the scrutiny of the soldiers’ commanding officer, not an unusual thing by any means. What is unusual is that it’s from a Fargrave loyalist.\n\n“You didn’t share the plan with your most trusted soldier? What if he pulled a sidearm? What if he killed one of my men?”\n\n“One question at a time. Please, Alexander,” Redding answers. “Obviously because it’s my ‘most trusted soldier,’ I knew what his reaction would be.”\n\n“He hit me,” Benjamin retorts. “Did you know that would happen?”\n\n“Well?” Alexander, the leader, comes to the aid of his man.\n\n“It was a coin toss,” Redding says. “And to be fair, I knew you’d hit him back, probably worse than you received. Seems I was right about that.”\n\nAlexander simply shakes his head. “Redding you old bastard. You’re still the same unconventional mastermind after all these years.”\n\nAll these years? Those two knew each other before? They must. The turning of one’s coat doesn’t come easily, at least not for a man like Redding who you’ve known for years. He’s never been one for material wealth. No, he considers experience far above possessions and a heavy coin purse.\n\nSuddenly, you realize why he’s taken such an interest in you over the years. It hits you like a crossbow bolt to the chest, an unexpected appearance of a lover, the news of a close friend’s death. He must know your past. A family line born of Magda. That’s the only explanation. Still, you resolve not to disclose damning information that isn’t expressed explicitly. As soon as Alexander bargains with Frontrunner’s Camp, you’ll be back home, or at least the New World equivalent. Best not to whisper anything that will punch your ticket to the gallows.\n\nWhile POWs are easily returned back to their country, spies are hung by the neck. Battling to death in the field of battle is honorable; lying to one’s neighbor and selling country secrets is much the opposite. The fact that the company is alive and witnessing everything, doesn’t speak well for you--even if you might have been at odds with Benjamin. They’ll be returned, spread the story of Redding and his prodigy\u0027s betrayal, and a picture of your face will be posted at every tavern, bar, and inn with the amount of money your life is deemed worth.\n\n“Now that’s settled,” Alexander continues, gesturing towards the Alteran company. “Form up. Ensure those ropes are tight. The garrison is stationed only a few miles from here. But still, I\u0027d like to have a nice and peaceful march there. Can you do that for me, men?”\n\nThe soldiers of Magda shout their agreement along with a salute. Despite your small scuffle, they don’t tie you up. They don’t take your weapons from you. Whatever arrangement Redding made must have included you as one of their turncoats, or spies, or whatever--it doesn’t really matter. Compliance with Magda will result in Alteran marking you for death, and you’re not exactly in the best position to refuse. Still, you’re armed, and the element of surprise can turn the tide, especially if you can free the rest of the company.\n",
  "page 51": "There are too many of them for the double-barrelled flintlock. You need to depend on something more reliable, a weapon with no down time, lest you be overwhelmed. Torch in your left, your right hand pulls the longsword from your shoulder. Its handle is a thin strip of leather spiraled around steel, specially modified to your suiting. Most prefer a soft grip, the ability to hold their weapon with comfort, a grip that muffles the clashing of steel. Not you. The leather strip brings no comfort; it’s only designation is to keep the blade from slipping from grasp. On brisk mornings, you can feel the cold steel as if nothing stood in-between your palm and the metal. Your arm welcomes the impact with each blow, toughened, conditioned by years of training.\n\nThey gather in front of you, no doubt more doing the same behind, a wave of dead men and women ready to crash upon you. You cut through them like a sparrow in the wind, like evening sunlight through a gap in the forest. The undead cannot meet your onslaught, their own bodies betraying them. Brittle bones snap under their weight, collapsing a few to the floor soon to be trampled by the others. The undead moan a dull vibration, long losing the ability to articulate words, the sound pouring from empty gaps where mouths used to be, soon to be silenced by your blade.\n\nCorporal Redding compliments your attack with perfect unison. It’s not the first time you’ve fought side-by-side, and your experience shows it. His movements are precise, careful not to exert too much energy. Yours, on the other hand, possess a little more flair, the excitement of youth displayed through your swordsmanship, your body possessing more than enough endurance for such attacks.\n\nNo words are shared between you two, but the assessment is clear. Keep moving. Put down the undead quickly. On their own, the undead don’t give much of a fight, but if allowed to overwhelm you--if they could overrun you with numbers then you would find yourself in a difficult position. They are unarmed and undefended. As soon as you cut down one, another takes their place.\n\nFinally, the end of the hallway appears. The number of undead are dwindling, each swing of your sword adding to the bodies piling up on the floor, a trail left behind you and Redding. You cut down the remaining few in your way. The hallway of the dead is behind you, your disturbance of the Blackbird resting place left with broken sarcophagi and severed limbs.\n",
  "page 50": "Cigars both at your lips, you survey the ruins a moment longer before moving. Confident that you will remain unseen, you swing your legs over the fallen trunk and land softly on the other side. You guide your longsword from its sheath, slow, as not to send its ringing into the silent air. With your sword in a comfortable, ready position, you sneak forward, Redding just ahead of you. The overgrowth covers your approach. More than a few trees and plants lie between your hiding spot and the ruins, more sprouting from within.\n\nRedding leads you past the first structure. Its walls are brought to the ground, only showing signs of its former life in sporadic areas in jagged edges, like the coastline of a map. As you pass, you catch sight of decaying items: chairs, tables, even what appears to be a religious figurine, all of which have been long exposed to the elements and show it. The same thing happens for the second. The third is where Redding stops. It’s clear to see why. It’s the largest of the fallen structures, appearing to be nearly twice the size of the first you passed by. Like the others, its crumbling walls display signs of life, long abandoned. Besides the sheer size, another factor separates it from the others.\n\nIt’s littered with human skeletons.\n\nTheir sharp white bones stick from the ground, keeping pace with the rampant overgrowth surrounding them. Some lie scattered, skulls far from their spines; others are more or less intact. All appear to be human bones, likely Blackbirds, long gone from the world, not a single one with skin attached. Interesting. Their skeletal structure looks the same as Alterans. Not that you’re a man of science by any means, but it’s grimly fascinating. Despite the large size of the Blackbird males, they are still human, as if you needed to see their skeleton to reach that conclusion.\n\nThe thought causes you to pick up a nearby bone and compare it to your own forearm. The bone is nearly a size and a half larger. Noted. Don’t entangle with a Blackbird strength vs strength; you may have a fair amount of lean muscle, but you also have a realistic idea of your own skill set. A schooner doesn’t broadside a galleon without outmaneuvering, after all.\n\n“Put that back,” Corporal Redding sharply whispers. “Over here.”\n\nYou look up to see Corporal Redding holding open a trapdoor. The square piece of wood is hinged completely open, revealing a square darkness below. A shiver runs down your spine, the cause of realization, the feeling of being watched. You immediately drop the arm bone. Experiment over. Redding stands behind the door holding it open for you. As you draw near, you can see a thin rope ladder attached near the door’s opening. The feeling rushes through your body again, the feeling of a close friend lying to your face, the unfortunate truth of a woman turning down your advances.\n\nRedding motions for you to take the ladder first. Hopefully that’s not the reason he brought you along--to test the strength of a thinning rope ladder. Who knows how far the fall is? Your thoughts quickly return back to the Blackbird arm bone. If the ladder could support someone of that size, surely it can support you. You hope. As you step towards the trap door, a pattern emerges. The skeletal bodies strewn out, seemingly random, appear to have an epicenter: the trapdoor. Like Frontrunner’s Camp, they\u0027re arranged in rings, circling around the trap door.\n\n“See you at the bottom,” you casually comment to Redding.\n\n“Not too quickly, I hope,” the corporal replies. After seeing your face, he says with a grin, “Bad joke. The ladder’s fine. Once you’re at the bottom give the rope a few tugs, and I’ll make my way down.”\n\n“Not too quickly, I hope,” you return the jest, taking both hands on the rope ladder.\n\nThankfully, the ladder is more sturdy than it appears. But still, there’s a slight sway as it holds your weight, a steady rocking with each step down. As you travel down fifteen, maybe twenty rungs, you’re enveloped into complete darkness, the sole source of light a square opening where Redding stands. However, by that point, you’ve become accustomed to the spacing, muscle memory serving to place your feet and hands exactly where they should be, exactly where the next rung appears. You take it slow. There’s no sense in rushing down. You don’t know how far down it does, and you aren’t thrilled with the idea of finding yourself a hundred feet up in the air drained of endurance. By the same coin, you aren’t thrilled with the idea of encountering enemies at the bottom drained of energy either.\n\nYou continue your steady pace until finally your boot hits solid ground rather than a rope rung. You breathe a sigh of relief, stretching out your arms and legs from the excursion. Looking up, you can still see the square of light fairly well. It’s about fifty, sixty feet up if you had to guess. A tug of the rope, and it starts to sway slightly, supporting the weight of Corporal Redding. The square of light is darkened completely. Redding must have shut the trapdoor. You silently hope he has a way of reopening it. Surely, he must. Doors aren’t usually locked from the inside, especially those that sit at the top of a sixty foot climb. But it’s the New World, after all. Stranger things have been seen. In less time that it took you, Corporal Redding’s boots land on the ground with a solid thud, his hand making a similar sound on your shoulder in reassurance.\n\nThere is no light...wherever you are. Redding flicks a match, and soon you can see minimally, but far better than before. You find yourself at the end of a tunnel. Wherever it leads, there’s a single path forward. This must be some sort of escape route leading from underneath the ruins, hence the trapdoor. There’s not anywhere else to go, so you and Corporal Redding follow the tunnel.\n\nIt winds, taking you around a few broad curves, but for the most part, it’s a straightforward path. Whoever dug the tunnel probably meant for the quickest route possible, only twisting out of the way of large unseen rocks. You’re content to allow Redding to take point. He hasn’t shared anything else with you, why he deceived the rest of the company--or at least details why. His reason is rather vague, and you trust the man to lead you despite his secrets, although you’re sure to keep a healthy amount of skepticism. Nothing crippling, just enough that outlandish requests will be seen as such. There’s enough blind devotion in Alteran.\n\nThe first match dies. Another is lit. Before the second one dies, another light source appears.\n\nIt’s the light of dusk, a black-raven shade allowing the eye to see with ample strain. It originates at the end of the tunnel, dark flame unwavering with the shadow, instead becoming a part of it. Torchlight, as demonstrated through the dwindling match, dances with shadow in perfect unison, the glow and darkness just out of reach from one another. This flame, however, is born of darkness, wrapped in shadowy embrace. It’s both light and shadow, visible and unseen.\n\nThe tunnel opens into a small room, a religious place by the looks of it. Small pads and mats rest on the floor, long covered by dust and dirt. A small altar sits in the center. To one side, a single torch hangs on the wall. It’s not made from wood wrapped in oil-soaked cloth. Its handle is a jagged black metal, giving it the appearance of a stem with thorns. The top radiates ravenlight through four blade-like points, the source of its energy remains a mystery.\n\n“What is this place?” you wonder aloud in a whisper.\n\n“Halls of the dead,” Redding answers, surprising you with an answer, and an honest one at that. “A resting place for fallen Blackbirds.”\n\n“I did not know they were so...religiously organized,” you say glancing around the room. “The stories say they are uncivilized cannibals. I expected more human sacrifice rather than a reverent temple.”\n\n“There are those, rest assured. If it’s savages you’re looking for, there are plenty of those.” Seeing your puzzled face through the dusklight, white teeth appear between Redding’s lips. “Oh don’t tell me you assumed the natives were all the same. They have different tribes and practices. True, they are united under ‘the Raven,’, but each tribe expresses their faith differently. This one is clearly one of their more...civilized ones, if that word can be applied to them.”\n\n“And what are we doing here then?”\n\nThe smile disappears. “There is an artifact of great power hidden within. One that will turn the tide in the war. It’s crucial that we claim it for ourselves.”\n\n“If it’s so powerful, then why is it hidden among the dead?”\n\n“Simple. The natives believe it to be cursed.”\n\nCorporal Redding motions you forward. Besides the tunnel, which looks as if it were dug in a hurry, a single door leads out from the small chapel, or whatever the Blackbirds call a place of worship. Redding opens the door, and similar ravenlight fills the hallway. What’s left of the underground structure is likely lit the same; the jagged torch doesn’t show signs of wavering. The thought causes you to pull it from the wall before exiting the chapel. Torch in hand, you step into the hallway.\n\nThe walls are lined with sarcophagi. Redding was literal when he said these were the halls of the dead. The stone resting places are squarely built from the same stone of the crumbling ruins above. Small inscriptions line the top, traveling around the exterior. The lids themselves are smooth, the stone grinded down to a surface like an icy lake. They line the hallway in rows of two, the second row being carved into the wall a few feet above where their counterpart rests on the ground.\n\nYou flash the torch in front of a sarcophagus. The language is unreadable, written in unfamiliar symbols that look more like small pictures than actual words. Despite the visual aid, you still have no idea what is carved into the stone. The military doesn’t exactly teach Blackbird as a second language, although you’re wondering if they should. Your mind quickly draws back to the mission, to the artifact that you are recovering. Curiosity brings you to think of the artifact’s form, whether it’s a tome of secrets, infused item, or a physical weapon. Your guess is a tome as Redding said it’ll turn the tide. Something with such an impact must be the powerful words of a sorcerer written long ago.\n\nDeep in your curiosity, you almost don’t hear it. A crack. The sound of stone breaking apart in the slightest amount of sound is picked up by your ears. The hair on the back of your neck rises, the feeling a sailor gets as the subtle signs of an approaching storm appear. You stop mid-step. Redding does the same. The two of you glance at each other, and you know the same thought is on your mind. Half a second later, you both break into a full spring down the hallway. Crack! Chunks of stone sarcophagi explode into the air with a puff of smoke like fireworks, clouds of smoke hiding the contents from being revealed within. Then you see it. Dark hands gripping the side of their respective sarcophagus, embalming tape hanging from decaying fingers like a stubborn flag unwilling to be torn down long after its citizens are conquered.\n\nThey are slow to rise from their resting place as you sprint past. A few fingers manage to reach out and touch your coat along the way, the unsuccessful reach of a drowning man without floating remnants of a shipwreck near to keep him afloat. However, the end of the hallway is a different story. Dark figures crowd in front of you, gathering more by the second. Dead men and women stand in your way, more behind you no doubt.\n\nYou see them in flashes, your sprint and ravenlight not affording clear vision of the dead.\n\nYou see them in flashes. Their skin hangs loosely from bone, threatening to abandon skeletal structure for the floor with each movement.\n\nYou see them in flashes. Soulless black holes rest where eyes used to be.\n\nYou see them in flashes.\n\nEmpty gaps as mouths.\n",
  "page 53": "The hallway opens into a large chamber, carved in a round shape. There is not a single corner to the walls; they wrap around the center like a banner twisting in the wind. Here, there are more ravenlight torches on the wall, so you abandon the one you carry, placing it on one of the hooks designed--at least you assume that’s their use--for easy placement of torches for those wandering the halls.\n\nThe very center of the room boasts a sizable sarcophagus, larger than any of the others you encountered before. The room is built on a slope, a series of stone steps, leading to the resting place. Unlike the ones encountered before, the lone sarcophagus is intricately engraved, covered completely with writing unknown to you. There’s a weighty silence that accompanies the chamber, one that is felt inwardly, one that makes your heartbeat sound like war drums.\n\n“Care to explain why the dead rise from their graves?” you whisper to Redding.\n\n“Protectors of the artifact,” is his reply.\n\n“...that’s it?”\n\nRedding turns to face you. “Fine. They’re ancient rulers, each a former possessor of the artifact. Their soul was given in service, so here, even in death they serve to protect the artifact from falling into the wrong hands. Our hands. They’re buried with their lifemates--that’s why there are two resting places created on top of each other. They’re bound to protect the artifact together, lest the souls of their lineage be forfeit. Happy now?”\n\nA fabricated story if you ever heard one. It’s too perfect. A good lie must have an aspect of being a lie, along with elements of truth, of course. Stories can’t address every question. That’s the sign of someone who knows they’ll be prodded--and the preparation made beforehand. Still, it’s a little satisfying if you’re being honest.\n\nYou nod. “Of course.”\n\nRedding stares at you a moment before turning his head back to the lone grave. “What? My most curious soldier doesn’t have any follow on questions? I bet there are a million things running through your mind right now.”\n\n“Two million, actually,” you whisper. “But they aren’t important right now. If we escape this place with our lives, rest assured we’re going to have a long talk.”\n\n“When we escape this place, I’ll answer every single one, and I’ll buy the first round.\"\n\n“First two rounds, you mean.”\n\n“Fine. First two.” He asks again. “Happy?”\n\n“As a nobleman with aged Alteran brandy.”\n\n“Good,” Redding says. “The artifact awaits us.”\n\nYour footsteps disturb the hanging silence. You can’t help but count each one, twenty-three in total. The stone sarcophagus sits in front of you. It’s made from a similar dark stone as the others, although it appears to have more of a sparkle. Upon further examination, there is some sort of crystal infused with the stone. They shimmer in tiny specks as if ground crystal was mixed with flowing magma, then shaped to its square shape. At least that’s your best un-educated guest. In reality, it could be something entirely different. Magic, perhaps.\n\n“Help me with this,” Corporal Redding says, gripping the stone lid with both hands. You do the same, standing opposite of him. It resists at first, and then gives way to your combined strength. With a grinding screech, one that disturbs the silence far greater than your footsteps, the lid slides from its closed position, one end landing on the ground, the other remaining posted against the sarcophagus at a diagonal angle.\n\nNo sooner than the lid hits the ground, a soft thunderclap echoes, the sound completely different than stone hitting the floor. Sound in a visible wave expands from the sarcophagus, as if the ripple of a rock thrown into a pond. Instantly, the ravenlight torches extinguish, sending the room into a darkness far greater than that of any night. Something pierces your mind, nothing you’ve ever felt before. It’s as if someone were tapping your mind with an impatient finger, waiting for your thoughts to catch up.\n\nDarkness abounds. You lose yourself to the void.\n",
  "page 52": "There’s not enough time to draw your longsword from your back. Your flintlock, holstered to your thigh, is the obvious choice. Easily accessible, quick to draw. Not breaking the sprint, your hand feels the familiar grip of the flintlock, polished wood with several chip marks, each a close friend to your palm. Its click is as distinct as any sound as you flick back the hammer, the sound of eminent death.\n\nThey gather in front of you, shoulder to shoulder, a sea of dead men and women ready to crash upon you. Their decrypted bodies fail them as the sea urges to meet you, unfamiliar words attempting to spill from their empty gaping holes. Old bones, unable to support weight, join their moans in the air. An ankle of one snaps, sending the undead Blackbird to the ground, soon trampled by the others. Through several pairs of legs, you see the fallen Blackbird reaching his arms forward, scratching at the ground attempting to pull himself toward you.\n\nCorporal Redding has chosen to draw his blade. It’s a normal longsword carried at his hip. Nothing intricate. Nothing special. No, his blade is meant for use rather than looks. Others in the command position of twelve men would take the chance to display something more flashy, a way to set themselves apart from the common soldier. The High King loves his chain of command, after all. He cuts through the dead as if nothing but a brush of the sleeve. Redding’s movements are precise. Efficient. He does not chop or swing. He cuts with the precision of a surgeon, removing limb from body, head from neck.\n\nYour shots compliment his handiwork. He dodges. You fire. He engages. You reload. In perfect unison, you tear through the wave of undead, words remaining unspoken between you two. Your flintlock, standard issue, is double-barrelled. Two shots in the chamber before needing to reload. Redding is aware, counting your shots, covering you during each reload. Your bullets tear through the undead, snapping heads back, often dropping several bodies with each shot. It’s a shooting gallery. It’s fucking open range--Blackbirds gathering before you, lining up, awaiting their turn for you to drop them into the dirt.\n\nThe body count grows high, each one piling up behind your forward progress, a trail of bodies left behind, their open sarcophagi silent above their new resting place. As quickly as the undead appeared, you put them down. You manage to make it through unscathed, two of the living departing from the halls of the dead.\n",
  "page 110": "When it comes down to it, you aren’t like them. There wouldn’t be a single Blackbird warrior in the camp to make the decision you’re about to. E’ffy’s completely at your mercy, and you don’t finish her off. It’s not the way you treat an ally. On the field of battle, there’s no mercy. Simply, it can not exist if death is to be escaped. Here, however, there’s room for it; need for it, a trust that’s built between fellow members.\n\nInstead of ending the skirmish with a single blow, you hold back.\n\nVisible anger appears on her face. E’ffy’s mouth becomes a tight slit, eyes following closely in the shape. The redness on her face, a subtle shade of crimson, begins to glow brighter, adding to the physical proof of exertion. The whites of her eyes expand, nostrils flared.\n\n“That is a mistake, bondsman,” she utters.\n\n(I whole-heartedly agree.)\n\nWith a cry, she then takes the offensive against you. E’ffy charges forward, arm cocked back to throw all of her weight and momentum into a single punch. You welcome it. Best to let the woman take her aggression out, even if her aggression might take the form of a bruise on your cheek the next day.\n\n“STOP!”\n\nChieftain Malic’ant’s voice stops E’ffy mid-step, like the wind was taken out of her sails, the anchor dropped at the exact same moment. She stops, turns, and faces her father. You remain where you are, noticing Redding and Onng watching from a distance. The chieftain’s hall becomes silent as any grave, as any morning after burying the dead the day before.\n\n“Step forward, outsider,” the chieftain orders. You comply. It takes exactly twelve steps to reach the other side of the training pit towards Malic’ant. With a half grunt-half groan of annoyance, the large Blackbird stands to his feet, pulling himself upright with his spear, at the same time waving off his royal guard, or whatever the chieftain protectorate is called. Crippled from age, Malic’ant still towers above you. Standing in his shadow is like finding a great oak in the midday of summer.\n\n“You showed my daughter mercy,” he flatly growls.\n\nYou find yourself nodding. “She is not my enemy, a worthy opponent, however.”\n\n(Suck up.)\n\nChieftain Malic’ant ponders a moment. His hand raises to scratch at his chin, the other remains firmly grasped around his spear. Up close, the spear is razor sharp, expectedly so. Feathers line the top, sending the blade protruding from underneath a wing, a common analogy for the Harri’ar. Malic’ant’s eyes scan you for signs of deception, the look every father gives his daughter’s guest, especially that of a male variety.\n\n“You do not have my blessing.”\n\nBehind you, E’ffy spits on the ground. She doesn’t look surprised, however. She must have known the path your actions set you upon. Onng wears a similar expression; Redding, oddly enough, looks disinterested. His mind is made up either way. Having the blessing of the Blackbird people is simply a formality in his mind. Whether having the backing of E’ffy’s father, he’s still going to take the fight to the S’umbra.\n\nAfter all of this, the struggle that you’ve undergone, making yourself enemies of both superpowers in the Old World, to find yourself here, at E’ffy’s father’s hut denied, sends more than a single thought of rage into your mind. Not to E’ffy’s extent, but you’ve not exactly shown a containment over passion yourself. The two of you are similar in that way, yet one is but a sliver of the other.\n\n“And just why is that?” you find yourself saying.\n\n“You do not hold the strength to do what is necessary,” the chieftain says. “You have skill, yes. But in the moment when action was required most, you did not do what needed to be done.”\n\n“It’s your own daughter!”\n\n“AND YOU SHAME HER BY NOT GIVING A WARRIOR’S DEFEAT.”\n\nDespite the lower volume, his next words seethe with more rage than the words shouted.\n\n“Bondsman or no, you do not have what it takes. Find another’s support.”\n\nYou know there’s not a single other chieftain in the war party that would lend support. The ability to defeat the S’umbra by lawful ways ends here. You’ve still got Amir’sshan and Redding who would die fighting by your side. E’ffy, you know, won’t approve of any unlawful means. Breath still occupies your lungs, but you’ve found yourself strayed from the path. Your journey may still continue, but among the path of the storyteller, it dies here.\n",
  "page 66": "Alexander wasn’t lying when he said the garrison was close. It doesn’t even take a day’s journey before it appears. In a section of the forest that loosens up on density, the New World Magda garrison joins the scattered trees with large wooden walls. Unlike Frontrunner’s, which holds true to its camp-like layout, the garrison boasts sturdy walls, fashioned from layers of sharpened timber. Those daring enough to climb them risk impalement as the walls are like that of shark teeth, several rows, the next rising a bit higher than the previous.\n\nYour instant reaction is that the Magda presence in the New World is much more established than the Alterans. Either that or they have the appearance of it, which is almost as good in your opinion. The color of the walls are the same as the jungle that surrounds it, likely meaning the clearing was man-made. Trees felled in order to be carved, sharpened, and placed exactly where their roots are currently decomposing in the dirt beneath.\n\nA horn rings through the trees, a deep rumble like a wild animal challenging another. One of the soldiers behind you answers with his own. Much more established indeed. The gate to the garrison is reinforced wood. Upon your return horn, voices shout from within the fort, commands being issued. A moment later the gate draws up, men from inside turning a pulley system.\n\n“Put them in the dungeon,” Alexander waves to a group of soldiers in greeting. They salute, and take the bound and gagged Alterans to an unseen location. “You two. Come with me.”\n\nHe doesn’t wait to see if you’re following. Alexander turns and takes off through the garrison. Redding, shrugging towards you, follows closely behind. Without any immediate superiors watching, you allow a sigh to escape your lips, one that’s been building for several hours now. The prisoner exchange better happen sooner than later. You’re not thrilled with the idea of your fellow soldiers remaining behind bars. Just because they are spared their lives, doesn’t mean the holding situation is any level of comfortable.\n\nThe inside of the garrison is filled with many buildings built from the same wood. They’re square, compact. Most of the windows are simply open, metal bars running across as to prevent unwanted entry, similar to the way the walls are sharpened. If there’s one thing for certain, the Magda garrison is controlling about who they let in or out. Several groups of crimson-clad soldiers, decked with steel breastplates, march by. You roughly estimate the garrison holds a little more than half of the population of Frontrunner’s, but they’re obviously more supplied and defended, each leader of the Old World having different avenues of conquest in the New.\n\n---\n\nThe next day your meeting with Alexander continues. Reuniting in the courtyard, he, once again, expects you and Redding to follow him. After passing by more buildings, Alexander stops at one, compact and square like the others, only this one is composed of many stories. There’s at least five, six of them, each level probably not more than two rooms each by looks of the foundation. Makes sense. Space is limited inside a fort. If you can’t build out, you build up. Alexander nods at the soldier posted at the door, a man with a jaw as square as the building he’s guarding. The soldier offers no friendly nod to you or Redding, merely stares at your approach. The three of you enter inside.\n\nSoft magelight greets you with a crimson glow, matching the shade of the Magda tunic. It’s a library. Bookshelves line the walls and fill the center in rows. Off to the far wall rest a few small desks, each with a small mage lamp sitting on top. The library is partially populated. Scribes by the look of it. Rather than steel breastplates, the inhabitants wear flowing robes, most with small gold-rimmed spectacles hanging from the tip of their nose. They pay you no mind; their research takes all of their attention.\n\n“Up here,” Alexander whispers, as not to disturb the peace, motioning towards a ladder. Seems a staircase takes up too much room. The three of you climb a, coincidentally, three stories before stepping into a mostly open room, this one built like a study. A large desk takes the center. Surrounding it are, of course, bookshelves and open cabinets to store loose scrolls. “This used to be the top floor, my personal study, “Alexander explains with more volume to his voice. “But we needed more room, and thus, a few more stories were added. Command still can’t believe I didn’t move to the top floor.”\n\nIf there’s any influence of Redding on the man, there it is. You silently wonder if more will be revealed as you get to know the man. Alexander sits down behind the desk, his large frame keeping up with the piece of furniture. The man himself, Redding, spots a small table at the far end of the study with a wine pitcher. He strides over and pours two cups, handing one to you, knowing that Alexander would refuse the offer. Cup in hand, you settle into the two guest seats, large lounge chairs, occupying the front of the desk.\n\n“Show it to me again,” Alexander speaks again.\n\nRedding shifts, drawing the dagger from his belt. Ravenblack. Winged-shaped handle. He sets it on the desk in front of him, noticeably not sliding it across towards Alexander. With the same unenthusiastic reaction that you held, Alexander continues speaking. “It doesn’t look like much. This is what those natives have been throwing their lives at to protect?”\n\n“Even the lives of those already fallen.” Redding answers. “But they dare not disturb the ruins. Luckily, I’m--we’re--not bound by such superstition.”\n\n“How does it work?” Alexander asks.\n\n“You’ll find out soon enough,” Redding says with a grin, one that quickly fades.\n\n“No. You’ll show me now.”\n\n(To be used for party tricks, am I?)\n\nStraight-faced you ignore the voice.\n\n(Your commander is in for a surprise.)\nHe’s not a commander; he’s a corporal.\n(So he does know how to answer.)\n\nRedding and the voice are interrupted. A Magda runner, out of breath, enters the study. Young boy with a face a similar shade of red as his tunic. “They’re gathering again. More than we’ve seen before.”\n\nAlexander waves his hand dismissively. “Take the 12th and 19th. Two should be enough to handle a simple raiding party.”\n\n“Sir, I don’t think you realize. It’s not a raiding party. It’s a war party.”\n",
  "page 65": "The march is largely silent except for the sounds you’d expect, stomping of boots, the constant rattling of swords in their sheathes, the heavy breathing of Mada soldiers wearing full breastplates. You’re glad to have nothing but leather: wearing steel while traveling through difficult terrain feels like a command gone wrong. Still, you don’t know the environment. Your feeling would be the opposite if a Blackbird ambush occurred.\n\n“So, kid. You must have questions,” Redding says without turning towards you.\n\nYou have enough discretion to speak knowing your audience, more specifically, the Magda commanding officer standing mere feet away. “I always have questions,” you say. “You know that. So we have the dagger. We’ve joined up with the...others. What’s next?”\n\n“My, my, Redding. You do like to compartmentalize. You’ve been under the leadership of Alteran for far too long,” Alexander comments.\n\nRedding, of course, ignores the man, even though he’s the commanding officer. Old friends, they are, which affords him a long leash, not that Redding ever needed slack doing his own thing. “Surely you have some sort of idea with what I’ve disclosed.”\n\nThere’s no use arguing with the man. You indulge. “We’ve journeyed to the New World, a place where the laws of the Old seem to be guidelines at best. We’ve been tasked with patrolling ancient Blackbird ruins, which I’m not certain is even an Alteran direct command at this point. But that doesn’t really matter either way since news of your--our--’change of plans’ will reach Frontrunner’s Camp regardless. We’ve discovered a secret weapon in the halls of the dead, defeating its guardian in the process.”\n\n“Very good. You have a firm grip on reality,” Redding dryly comments.\n\nYou give him the same treatment that he just gave Alexander. “There must be a different sort of war taking place on the New World soil, one that wouldn’t be allowed in the Old. The rules of war differ here.”\n\n“Good, good. Now keep going.”\n\n“The dagger will turn the tide somehow. Without knowing exactly what it does, what it is, it’s hard to say what’s going to happen next. Perhaps an utter dismantling of Alteran presence in the New World, although that may be thinking too large a scale.”\n\nRedding and Alexander glance at one another. Redding speaks first. “Told you he was worth having.”\n\n“Indeed you did,” Alexander idly says.\n\nThey don’t share any further detail, but their approval must mean that you’re spot-on with your speculation. The rest of the journey is traveled in silence, save for the sounds of boots, swords, and breathing.\n",
  "page 68": "“Alright, son. You have my attention. Spill it all out,” Alexander commands.\n\n“Outer scouts have caught sight of a large number of Blackbirds, much larger than any raiding party we’ve come across so far.\n\n“Yes, yes. You said that already, boy. How many are there?”\n\n“Scoutleader Prinn discovered them. They snuck through our first perimeter, somehow. They meld into the forest, even with such a large amount.”\n\n(Prinn!) You notice he’s not “Scholar” or “Scribe” Prinn.\n\n“How many, boy. I won’t ask again.”\n\n“At least a thousand,” the messenger whispers. His voice slightly cracks with the word.\n\n“Gods. They must have unified tribes.”\n\n“So,” Corporal Redding starts. “You wanted me to demonstrate the artifact…”\n\n“Looks like you’ll get the opportunity in a practical setting. You two,” Alexander points at Redding and you. “Change out of that Alteran garb. We don’t need any accidents on the battlefield. Find the quartermaster. Tell him I sent you. And you, boy,” Alexander turns to the messenger. “Run to Lieutenant Benjamin at the gate. Tell him to hold and await my orders.”\n\nWith a salute, the messenger leaves. You and Redding take off after him down the ladder. You find that you’ve had your fill of ladders for the near future. The messenger points out the quartermaster’s post before heading for the gate. Soldiers are running about in pairs to join their formations. It’s not a unique system; each soldier has a designation “war companion” to help with armor, ensure each other gets to formation in time, etc. Command can’t keep track of every individual soldier, so that task is delegated between the soldiers themselves. The fort must have been warned of your arrival, but stil, many passing Magda soldiers give you strange looks, no doubt looking at your Alteran uniform.\n\nYou enter the quartermaster’s post, a small square building, unsurprisingly, and a burly man with a thick chestnut moustache greets you with the barrel of a flintlock, clicking the hammer back almost as soon as the door closes.\n\n“Gods, you startled me, gentlemen,” the quartermaster speaks through a voice that is present in taverns everywhere. “You must be Captain Alexander’s ‘associates.’ What’ll it be, uni, weapons, armor?”\n\n“Just the tunics for now. And any leather you have lying around,” Redding answers.\n\n“Leather, hmm. I might have some lying around,” the quartermaster rubs his chin. “Are you sure you don’t want steel?”\n\n“The leather will work fine,” you reinforce Redding’s request.\n\n“Alright then. It’ll work fine until an arrow pierces right through. I’ll see what I’ve got, hmm.” The quartermaster leaves into an open doorway behind him, likely equipment storage. A little while later, which feels a lot longer than it actually was given the present circumstance, he returns with two crimson tunics and boiled-leather chestplates, along with matching bracers. “See how these fit.”\n\nYou drop the deep blue overcoat, now in less-than-pristine condition after trudging through the jungle, not to mention the Blackbird halls of the dead. The tunic slides on easily enough, although its shade is a bit too bright for your liking. Like the other soldiers, you tuck the tunic into your trousers and slide the armor on top, your longsword being the finishing touch, traveling from right shoulder to left hip.\n\n“It’ll have to do,” the quartermaster ponders aloud, still rubbing his chin in thought. “At the very least you don’t have to worry about one of your allies stabbing you in the back by accident.” He laughs, yet you remain straight-faced. The implication of the joke, although unintentional, is clear to a man who just discarded his soldier’s uniform for another. “Now off with you. There’s no savages to kill here.”\n\nLooking the part of the Magda soldier, you leave the quartermaster’s office. Alexander didn’t give you official orders, but there’s only one place to be. The war party gathers outside the fort. You follow the soldiers gathering near the gate. Horns, possessing a similar cry as during your arrival, ring in the air, filling in the gaps between boots crunching the earth underneath. A sea of red washes towards the gate, the dam, battle-ready. Somber is the mood, the thing of seasoned warriors. There’s no excitement. No one who’s tasted battle yearns for it, at least those who still carry the mind of a sane man.\n\nNot having strict orders, a command, a unit--you name it, you and Redding take position near the eastern wall, at the corner, where it connects with the main gate. You stand still for a moment, not wanting to be in anyone’s way, then you notice space on the rampart. A switchback staircase later (you’re surprised it’s not a ladder) and you find yourself overlooking the would-be battlefield. It’s not a clear view; the forest blocks most of your view.\n\nThen like the creeping blackness of dawn, they appear.\n\nShadows, the figure of men, creep from behind trees, ducking underneath vines. Unlike the Blackbird woman you found yourself face-to-face with, every instinct screams enemy! Sinister, they are. A formless mass of warriors. Even from your vantage they appear large in stature. Rumors tend to embellish; not in this case. Like the stories say, the natives stand a full head taller than the average Alteran. Suddenly, the light leather you wear doesn’t seem as protective. Still, it’s the armor you’re used to fighting in. You’re silently glad that the company is locked up away from sight. One, they are bound and defenseless. Two, they can’t see you wearing the colors of the High King’s rival.\n\nThe sea of soldiers part, and Alexander strides forward, his feathered steel helm underneath one armpit. On the ramparts, archers still survey the battlefield, although you can tell their focus is on their captain as well, like the trained ears of a mother when a child acts out. Their arrows are nocked but not yet drawn. Alexander takes the staircase, and at the top, a figure meets him. You’re surprised you didn’t see him before. Unlike the other soldiers, the figure is dressed in a forest green cloak, which boasts a sizable collar, rising to the tip of the figure’s nose. A bow and quiver lies on the figure’s back, one of fine craftsmanship, far past the quality of the archers next to you.\n\nAlexander addresses the soldiers. Seems a speech before battle is a custom in Magda as well.\n\n“Men of the Supreme Leader, today you will bring honor to Magda. You’ve fought and defeated the savages of this land many times already. There may be a greater number of them now, an entire war party, but that makes your victory for the Supreme Leader even greater. The first victory has already been won. They expected to find us unawares. They thought they could show up on our doorstep and barge inside. That is not the case, the furthest thing from the case. Scoutleader Prinn here (Alexander puts his hand on a green cloaked shoulder) discovered the savages’ plot, tracked them. Scoutleader--\n\n--Prinn takes another look at your crudely drawn battle plans in the dirt. It’s nothing more than a simple line with an arrow pointing in its side, signaling “ambush.”\n\n“I don’t know,” he says, adjusting his glasses. “It might just piss them off even more.”\n\nYour younger self smiles. “Interesting choice of words there. Oh it will piss them off for sure.”\n\n“And you’re sure it won’t come back on us?”\n\n“You mean splash damage?”\n\n“You know what I mean.”\n\n“Fairly certain. You’re the one that built the pressure plates anyway.” You sigh. “We’ll be wearing masks. Unless they catch us and tear them from our face, they’ll never know. They’ll assume, sure. But they won’t have any evidence.\n\nPrinn smiles. “Let’s just hope there aren’t any in-depth investigations as to the series of chamber pots that have gone missing. ‘Constable Marburry And The Case Of The Missing Chamber Pot.’”\n\nChildlike laughter escapes your lips. “How the hell are you the smartest in our class?”\n\n“Because it’s filled with students like yourself.”\n\nYou throw a punch into the boy’s shoulder. “They should be coming down here soon. Kelle always takes this route after lecture to save time.”\n\nThe two of you, wearing green cloaks to blend in with the forest, hunker down behind a tree. A silence ensues, one that often appears before combat, not that you recognized it at the time. A little while later footsteps, faintly, fill the forest air, growing louder with each step. Kelle and his two goons come into view, wearing their school robes.\n\n“Ready?” you whisper to Prinn, sliding a black cloth mask over your face.\n\n“I think so,” is his reply, also covering his face.\n\nYour hands grab for the basket of spoiling vegetables sitting next to you, a squishy tomato ends up in your palm, a rotten apple in Prinn’s. Motioning your head to signal now! the two of you break from your hiding place, arms cocked back like a professional Runball player. Shock. Freeze. Kelle and his two goons don’t know how to react to the sudden ambush, another lesson you would learn in the military. Your tomato explodes in a splash of red, leaving a juicy impact on Kelle’s robes, the splash damage hitting his face as well. That seems to bring them back to reality, just in time for Prinn’s rotten apple to hit one of the goons, splattering like a wine jar falling from the table.\n\nSurprise turns to anger. “You both are dead!” Kelle shouts. You take the chance to throw another rotting vegetable his way before turning and high-tailing it deeper into the forest, Prinn already far ahead. Your vision becomes a blur of trees, leaves, and branches, coming into existence just in time for you to blow by. Your breath is heavy. But still you run, adrenaline pumping through your veins, scared, yet thrilled at the rush of emotion, half of them you probably couldn’t even describe. This is true living, not sticking your nose in a book for ten hours a day.\n\nYou run the course, Kelle after you, not knowing the designed route. You pass by a sturdy oak, then a sapling, then a fallen tree. The fallen tree. It lies across the path, covering the other side, framed by overhanging branches. A perfect tunnel. A perfect place for a trap. Instead of leaping over the fallen trunk, you use your momentum to kick off the trunk. Your body flies high in the air, far quicker than when you practiced--a result of fearing for your life versus simply training.\n\nThere’s a sturdy branch off to the side of the path, one whose sister branch bears a series of chamber pots that “mysteriously” went missing from the school. Before you have time to register your flight, your chest smacks into the branch, and you barely manage to wrap your arms around it. As you pull yourself up, the pressure of your grip shaves bark from the branch, and like a loose handhold for a rock climber, it goes tumbling down to the ground, you soon to be shortly after--\n\n--A hand clasps with yours. Prinn! He’s already in the tree, one arm outstretched, his blonde curls in his eyes, but he does not dare attempt to adjust it. He’s not strong enough to pull you up, but he halts your downward momentum, allowing you to slowly climb back up. Before you can thank him, footsteps, pressure plate. The mechanism tethered to the sister branch flips, and several, full, chamber pots overturn, spilling their contents onto three young boys below.\n\nFirst, again, surprise. Then rage, far beyond the reaction to rotten vegetables thrown their way, rage in only a way a young boy can express with the inability to formulate coherent sentences, simply guttural sounds mixed with tears, the rage of a boy who doesn’t understand the present situation, yet feels white hot blood pumping through his veins. Thick brown liquid slides down the side of Kelle’s face, mixing with tears. Their rage causes them to pick up rocks. While you threw soft, spoiling fruit, they choose fist-sized stones, upping the ante.\n\nLike a thick hailstorm, a wave of projectiles fly towards you. Exposed, without anywhere to hide, you\u0027re a victim to their assault. One hits you in the shoulder, another glances from your forehead. Prinn gets the same treatment. If you stay put, you’re dead, so to speak. If you jump, at least there’s a running chance. Silently you curse, using a word that you’ve heard your father whisper when he thought he was alone. Your plan ended with dumping the chamber pot contents on Kelle. Damn you for not thinking past that. With a cry, Prinn falls from the branch, a large rock doing more than glancing from his brow, his mask knocked from his face, glasses, cracked and bent, knocked from his head.\n\nPrinn!\n\n--and it’s because of his bravery, and loyalty to our Supreme Leader Fargrave that we are prepared to meet the savages head-on. Gods bless the Scoutleader Prinn. Gods bless Supreme Leader Fargrave. Gods bless Magda!”\n\nAlexander’s speech ends and draws you from the memory. The Scoutleader, Prinn, standing next to Alexander looks nothing like the scrawny boy you remember. You wonder if he’ll recognize you. Probably not. It’s been many years, just over a decade. People change. They attempt to keep up with the wheel of time, putting up a good fight, but never end up victorious. Over the years it weighs on a person. They grow wrinkled and ache in places they’ve never noticed before. It happens to a degree when leaving childhood behind, and is magnified tenfold in less than that many decades. The man that stands before you is proud and strong, confident, the exact opposite of his childhood self. His blonde hair is buzzed and there’s no sign of his glasses.\n\nAfter his speech, Alexander meets with several of his officers. Prinn’s gaze lands on you.\n\n(Is that recognition?)\n\nHe strides atop the ramparts to where you and Redding stand. You notice his eyes don’t shift from side to side, they don’t watch his boots as he walks. They are focused directly on his targets: you. Prinn stops just in front of you. Up close you see he wears light leather underneath his cloak, and his belts--one at his waist two across the chest--are covered with pockets for storing small items. Gone is his boyhood face, replaced with a hardened face of a man who’s faced the realities of combat. He does not introduce himself, speaking a question is more of a statement.\n\n“You possess the artifact.”\n\n“The one and only,” Redding answers.\n\n“Good. We’ll have a...special assignment in the battle. Come with me.”\n",
  "page 67": "Alexander wasn’t lying when he said the garrison was close. It doesn’t even take a day’s journey before it appears. In a section of the forest that loosens up on density, the New World Magda garrison joins the scattered trees with large wooden walls. Unlike Frontrunner’s, which holds true to its camp-like layout, the garrison boasts sturdy walls, fashioned from layers of sharpened timber. Those daring enough to climb them risk impalement as the walls are like that of shark teeth, several rows, the next rising a bit higher than the previous.\n\nYour instant reaction is that the Magda presence in the New World is much more established than the Alterans. Either that or they have the appearance of it, which is almost as good in your opinion. The color of the walls are the same as the jungle that surrounds it, likely meaning the clearing was man-made. Trees felled in order to be carved, sharpened, and placed exactly where their roots are currently decomposing in the dirt beneath.\n\nA horn rings through the trees, a deep rumble like a wild animal challenging another. One of the soldiers behind you answers with his own. Much more established indeed. The gate to the garrison is reinforced wood. Upon your return horn, voices shout from within the fort, commands being issued. A moment later the gate draws up, men from inside turning a pulley system.\n\n“Put them in the dungeon,” Alexander waves to a group of soldiers in greeting. They salute, and take the bound and gagged Alterans to an unseen location. “You two. Come with me.”\n\nHe doesn’t wait to see if you’re following. Alexander turns and takes off through the garrison. Redding, shrugging towards you, follows closely behind. Without any immediate superiors watching, you allow a sigh to escape your lips, one that’s been building for several hours now. The prisoner exchange better happen sooner than later. You’re not thrilled with the idea of your fellow soldiers remaining behind bars. Just because they are spared their lives, doesn’t mean the holding situation is any level of comfortable.\n\nThe inside of the garrison is filled with many buildings built from the same wood. They’re square, compact. Most of the windows are simply open, metal bars running across as to prevent unwanted entry, similar to the way the walls are sharpened. If there’s one thing for certain, the Magda garrison is controlling about who they let in or out. Several groups of crimson-clad soldiers, decked with steel breastplates, march by. You roughly estimate the garrison holds a little more than half of the population of Frontrunner’s, but they’re obviously more supplied and defended, each leader of the Old World having different avenues of conquest in the New.\n\n---\n\nThe next day your meeting with Alexander continues. Reuniting in the courtyard, he, once again, expects you and Redding to follow him. After passing by more buildings, Alexander stops at one, compact and square like the others, only this one is composed of many stories. There’s at least five, six of them, each level probably not more than two rooms each by looks of the foundation. Makes sense. Space is limited inside a fort. If you can’t build out, you build up. Alexander nods at the soldier posted at the door, a man with a jaw as square as the building he’s guarding. The soldier offers no friendly nod to you or Redding, merely stares at your approach. The three of you enter inside.\n\nSoft magelight greets you with a crimson glow, matching the shade of the Magda tunic. It’s a library. Bookshelves line the walls and fill the center in rows. Off to the far wall rest a few small desks, each with a small mage lamp sitting on top. The library is partially populated. Scribes by the look of it. Rather than steel breastplates, the inhabitants wear flowing robes, most with small gold-rimmed spectacles hanging from the tip of their nose. They pay you no mind; their research takes all of their attention.\n\n“Up here,” Alexander whispers, as not to disturb the peace, motioning towards a ladder. Seems a staircase takes up too much room. The three of you climb a, coincidentally, three stories before stepping into a mostly open room, this one built like a study. A large desk takes the center. Surrounding it are, of course, bookshelves and open cabinets to store loose scrolls. “This used to be the top floor, my personal study, “Alexander explains with more volume to his voice. “But we needed more room, and thus, a few more stories were added. Command still can’t believe I didn’t move to the top floor.”\n\nIf there’s any influence of Redding on the man, there it is. You silently wonder if more will be revealed as you get to know the man. Alexander sits down behind the desk, his large frame keeping up with the piece of furniture. The man himself, Redding, spots a small table at the far end of the study with a wine pitcher. He strides over and pours two cups, handing one to you, knowing that Alexander would refuse the offer. Cup in hand, you settle into the two guest seats, large lounge chairs, occupying the front of the desk.\n\n“Show it to me again,” Alexander speaks again.\n\nRedding shifts, drawing the dagger from his belt. Ravenblack. Winged-shaped handle. He sets it on the desk in front of him, noticeably not sliding it across towards Alexander. With the same unenthusiastic reaction that you held, Alexander continues speaking. “It doesn’t look like much. This is what those natives have been throwing their lives at to protect?”\n\n“Even the lives of those already fallen.” Redding answers. “But they dare not disturb the ruins. Luckily, I’m--we’re--not bound by such superstition.”\n\n“How does it work?” Alexander asks.\n\n“You’ll find out soon enough,” Redding says with a grin, one that quickly fades.\n\n“No. You’ll show me now.”\n\n(To be used for party tricks, am I?)\n\nStraight-faced you ignore the voice.\n\n(Your commander is in for a surprise.)\nHe’s not a commander; he’s a corporal.\n(So he does know how to answer.)\n\nRedding and the voice are interrupted. A Magda runner, out of breath, enters the study. Young boy with a face a similar shade of red as his tunic. “They’re gathering again. More than we’ve seen before.”\n\nAlexander waves his hand dismissively. “Take the 12th and 19th. Two should be enough to handle a simple raiding party.”\n\n“Sir, I don’t think you realize. It’s not a raiding party. It’s a war party.”\n",
  "page 69": "Prinn leads you back down the switchback staircase. As your foot hits the last step, you hear the distinct sound of bowstring thwungs! a volley of arrows sent raining down on the gathering natives. If you didn’t experience the rough landing to the New World that you did, you would think them foolish and unprepared for the battle. From your brief glimpse on the ramparts, they didn’t appear to have any siege weapons with them, nor (ugh) ladders to scale the walls of the fort. Still, somehow they managed to sink Alteran vessels moving in the water. A stationary fort, though with strong walls, may be at the mercy of such firepower. And despite Magda’s well-equipped garrison, you didn’t see any cannons or counter-siege weapons of their own. They may have a defensive fort, but their power is severely lacking. An Alteran fort of this size would have no less than 10 guns pointing down the road to the single gate. Sticks and stones may break bones, but cannonfire puts an end to the discussion.\n\nBack through the main yard, past a few square buildings, Prinn silently leads you without a word. Redding doesn’t seem to be willing to break the silence either, likely both are listening to the battle sounds, determining the events by sound alone. Another thwung! A second volley is loosed at the natives. They’ll be cut down before even reaching the garrison walls. Finally, Prinn stops at an, uncoincidentally, square building. He opens the single door, and waves you inside.\n\nThe battle sounds are deadened here. It’s the top level of a jail. A lone Maga soldier sits behind a table next to a reinforced locked door. The soldier looks up upon your arrival, his face glowing orange from the single candle burning on the table, dangerously close to a thick ledger. If this is the dungeon where the company is being kept, it’s aptly named.\n\n“Appointment,” the guard speaks.\n\n“Prinn, Scoutleader, two guests,” Prinn states back.\n\n“Mhm. Mmhmm. Ah,” the guard scans the ledger with one finger, oblivious to the battle happening just outside the front door. “Here we are. Prinn, Scoutleader. Two guests.” The guard stands, a long drawn-out sigh escaping his lips. From his belt, he pulls a sizable keyring. You imagine if one more key were placed on the ring, it would burst apart. However, the guard pulls the exact one he’s looking for with the first draw. He unlocks the door, and like Prinn just moments ago, waves you inside.\n\n“Enjoy your stay. Two feet from the cells, please.”\n\nThe three of you enter the dungeon. You notice the door gets locked behind you. Worst comes to worst and you need a way out, it won’t be the way you just came. Somehow you think a “guest” doesn’t have much leverage behind locked doors. Prinn grabs a torch hanging on the wall, a normal burning one, unlike the one you carried in the halls of the dead. Shadows dance just out of reach as you’re led down the narrow corridor.\n\nCell doors pass on either side, the torch highlighting their barred frames. Most are empty. Some have thin creatures squatting in the corner, which you catch mere glimpses of, far away from the door itself. The dungeon is orderly, so much in fact that the High King might tip his crown to the way it’s run. Whoever resides here has long since been conditioned not to approach anyone walking out their door. Still, you don’t take any chances and keep more than an arm’s reach away.\n\nUpon reaching the final cell door, Prinn reaches inside his cloak and produces a key. It’s not one he gained from the jailer as you never saw them exchange any such thing. The cell creaks open, disturbing the ominous quiet, yet adding to the uneasy feeling that’s accompanying such a place as this. Prinn strides inside, and you can only keep following.\n\n“So this’s what’s become of you, eh?”\n\nYou turn to find Bastus leaning against his cell door, directly across from the one that Prinn opened. His beard is matted with some sort of liquid, too thick to be water. It’s been but a day, and yet the man looks entirely different than he did the previous morning. Only dressed in a loincloth, the large man looks thinner than before. Your mind tells you weight isn’t lost that easy, but your eyes see another story.\n\nYou choose your words carefully as Redding and Prinn are within listening distance. “I do as I must. That’s all any man can do.”\n\nLaughter spills from within the beard. It causes liquid to shake from Bastus’ chin, like a mongrel after retrieving a bone from a body of water. “The lie told by a traitor, the one he tells himself is true.”\n\nYou do not know what to say. Any defense will raise questions with Prinn and Redding. The thought briefly enters your mind that you could drop them now; the Alteran standard flintlock is double-barreled, after all. You could then lead the company back to Frontrunner’s Camp with the Magda garrison busy dealing with the Blackbirds.\n\nNo.\n\nFor the same reason you didn’t risk escape earlier. Bastus may be treated poorly, but his life isn’t at risk. The murder of two Magda members would set the garrison aflame with burning vengeance. They would hunt you down. Better to wait for the POW exchange. Do things the proper way. For now, you’ll just have to endure and carry on as normal.\n\n(Quite the young hero we have here. I wonder if they would do the same in your position.)\nDoesn’t matter.\n(Oh it matters, whether you’re willing to admit it or not.)\n\nAs you enter the cell, you leave Bastus with final words. “There is much that happens outside our narrow view.” You cross into the open doorway, Bastus cackling at your back, likely more liquid sprayed in the air. The cell is meant for one, maybe two prisoners. It’s empty, however, save for your two companions. Chains hang from the wall, a pair of them, answering the question of how many prisoners would occupy it. The walls are square stones. So far, the dungeon has been the only structure in the garrison built from more than lumber. Steel reinforced doors and cell walls; now stone, as the interior. Which begs the question, why are we--\n\n“You’re probably wondering why we’re here,” Prinn says, barely louder than a whisper, the voice two parents would make over a sleeping child. “There’s an escape route of sorts dug into these walls. It leads to an underground tunnel that will take us just beyond the assembling natives.”\n\n“I didn’t think the glorious scoutleader would be interested in running from a battle,” Redding digs.\n\n“You misunderstand,” Prinn answers, taking the opposite approach of Redding. “Which is the most effective way to swing a sword?”\n\nYou’ve heard the saying before. “When your enemy least expects it.”\n\nPrinn nods. “Exactly.” Then his eyes narrow. “Have we met before?”\n\nPanic floods through your body. As with any lie, the words must be spoken with full confidence. “I think I’d remember meeting a scoutleader in the Supreme Leader’s military.”\n\n“And I a turncoat to his country.”\n\n(Shouldn’t he be more happy with the color of your coat?)\nInfinitely so.\n(He meant it as an insult.)\nI’m well aware.\n(Why didn’t you tell him of your past?)\nThe company is within earshot. Besides, the past is the past. Besides, why am I answering you?\n(Because you’re used to me in your head.)\n\nNot a reassuring thought--words--whatever. You suppose the voice is right. It does feel more normal, at least as normal as a mysterious voice in your head can be. Hopefully the “conversations” stay normal, and you don’t have the voice tempting you to commit a deed that will end up putting your body in a place such as this, permanently.\n\nThe click of a switch, and one section of the wall reveals a small tunnel. Prinn goes first, Redding closely behind. As you enter, leaving the company behind locked up, you silently hope there aren’t any more ladders that await you, although reality has a funny way of spoiling the wine in your wineskin.\n",
  "page 60": "The soldiers form up. You count 17 of them, including Alexander. That leaves 16 under his command, a few more bodies than the typical Alteran company. They do strange things in Magda. Of course that means there are too many to fight on your own. Your first objective is to free the men. With numbers evened out, along with the chaos that your surprise will bring, the odds are fairly good. The act isn’t to save the lives of the men; they’ll be returned safely. The act is to save your own life within Alteran. Redding be damned. He’s already made his choice. The hell you won’t make your own.\n\nFour rows of four line up, the bound Alteran soldiers sent to the middle to be closely guarded. That leaves eight in front, and eight behind if you exclude Alexander and Redding from the equation. A plan begins to form in your mind. With the company free, tearing through eight surprised soldiers of Magda will be no problem. You’ve seen how deadly the company can be. Introduce a little urgency from prisoner’s bonds, and they’ll fight like crazed animals to be free. They may have questions in your involvement, but once the action begins their training and instinct should take over.\n\nThey put you next to Corporal Redding, perhaps so he can keep an eye on you. You suppose it’s just Redding now, or whichever rank he holds in Magda. You’ve never heard of a spy holding such a low rank as corporal. Typically, they’re above even that of a captain’s rank. Another realization hits you. If Redding was posing as a lowly corporal, then of course success followed the man since he’s operating at a level far below his station. Hopefully that’s the last one for the day. Truthfully, you’re damn tired of discovering truths that long hid themselves as lies within your life.\n\nYou use the overgrowth of the forest as your ally. As the group travels through an especially thick section, you act, suddenly turning on the soldiers marching behind you. The first one’s breastplate makes a perfect kicking target. You push the sole of your foot out, stamping it onto the breastplate, leaving behind a dirty imprint of your boot. Unprepared for the assault, he staggers back into the waiting arms of Bastus. Then the swarm begins.\n\nThe bound company use their tied wrists as clubs, some reaching for the man’s broadsword. With the broadsword in hand, one-by-one, each removes themselves of their bonds. You pull your flintlock, press the hammer back, and fill the jungle air with gunpowder smoke. The shot blasts through a Magda soldier’s face, and he drops to the dirt like a board, his legs stiff. You toss his broadsword to the company. There’s no going back now; blood has been spilled. You repeat the process with another nearby soldier. Alteran flintlock, standard issue. Double barreled.\n\n“Redding, you daft fool. Control your man!” Alexander shouts from the front of the group.\n\nThrough the chaos, you barely hear Redding’s response. “Been trying for years. The kid’s a wildfire.” Probably not the one Alexander was looking for.\n\nA scream from the company. One has fallen. You cut your way towards them, then a soldier of Magda blocks you off. Benjamin. He looks pleased to see you, no doubt approving of your decision to fight. It’s written all over his face. He’ll put you down, and they’ll probably slap a goddamn medal on his chest for doing so. There are harsh consequences for breaking the civility of war.\n\nBenjamin stands in front of you, broadsword and hand buckler gleaming from the small amount of light that made it through the canopy. It might as well be a cloudless sunny day for you after traveling through the underbelly of the ruins and the darkness within. The sight advantage, yours. The superior numbers, weapons, and armor, his. The inside of your mouth suddenly feels rather dry.\n",
  "page 62": "Alteran flintlock, standard issue. Double barrelled. It’s gotten you out of trouble more times than you can count. It dropped the Blackbird lich not hours before. Once again you call upon the weapon. Two shots already fired, you need to reload quickly. Reloading the weapon during combat is no easy thing. It requires focus. It requires steady hands. Fortunately, the Alteran version of the weapon helps in that regard.\n\nRather than stuffing bullets down the barrel, your finger finds a switch to the outside of the weapon, in-between the trigger and safety. The flintlock hinges open, the barrel angling down towards the dirt, revealing the open chamber. You pop two bullets in, taken from the ammunition at your belt, and snap the weapon closed with a jerk of your hand upwards. A feeding mechanism within the gun automatically refreshes the gunpowder needed, considering the compartment holds ample volume. The days of an infantryman carrying loose gunpowder are long in the past.\n\nYour eyes draw to the man’s forehead. It becomes your entire focus. The target. Nothing else matters.\n\nThe flintlock is raised to firing position, your arm conditioned to hold the weight of the weapon from countless hours of use. Your pointer finger on the trigger is patient. It’s been disciplined over the years, at first wanting to pull instantly. No, you make it wait for the perfect moment. You slow your exhale, eyes on the target, the space between Benjamin’s two eyes, and fire.\n\nExpecting a hole to appear through his head, you’re surprised when, instead, a gleaming hand buckler blocks your vision of the target--and the bullet itself. Frustrated as the set up was perfect, you cock back the hammer. One bullet left in the chamber, not enough time to reload again.\n\nBenjamin advances, a predator heavily defended and armed with his broadsword. In a few steps he’ll be upon you. The next bullet must land. His vitals protected, you do the only thing you can. Your vision lowers. So, too, does the flintlock. You put a bullet through his thigh. With a scream, he collapses to one knee. You take the opportunity to step around him, as your main goal is to reunite with the company, now freed.\n\nSharp pain ignites throughout your body. Somehow Benjamin managed to lunge several feet, wounded, and strike back. His arm is extended out, the length of his broadsword traveling the rest of the distance between you, the point piercing your lower back. The pain freezes you for a moment, and a rush of clarity soon follows the pain. The other soldiers of Magda are closing in around you.\n\n“Hit me first and I’ll hit back, worse.” Benjamin utters Redding’s words before strength leaves his arm. He slumps down clutching his wounded leg. The others close in. There’s not enough time to reload.\n",
  "page 61": "They outnumber you, and the flintlock only holds two bullets at a time. You’re pretty quick at reloading, quicker than most soldiers you’ve served alongside, but no one’s that fast. It’s loaded, ready to spark death, but you leave it in your holster. Should you find yourself in an...unfortunate position, it’ll be ready to come to your aid. Until then, it’ll be your little secret.\n\nYou carry it on your back. It runs from right shoulder to left hip. Your right hand reaches back and finds the hilt of your longsword. With a sound that you’ve heard many times, the sound of imminent struggle, the sound that warns your arms for the upcoming beating that’s about to occur, you draw the blade. It can be wielded with one or both hands. You opt for both.\n\nYou take the offensive, knowing that you can’t afford to engage with a single man longer than necessary. The trick to fighting outnumbered is to strike hard and fast. Take down each as soon as possible before being overwhelmed. It requires aggression. It requires the ferocity of a caged animal. You swing low, then prod the blade forward looking for holes in Benjamin’s defenses. He raises the hand buckler expertly, deflecting each swing of your sword. You engage again, running through a series of feints and thrusts. Again, he merely blocks your advance, not even attempting to counter. A smile begins to spread on the man’s face. You realize why.\n\nSuperior armor and numbers, not to mention swords, Benjamin is taking the patient route towards your death. He does not need to out-duel you with the clashing of blades; he merely needs to keep you busy until the others can run you through. Realization urges you to a greater level of focus, feeling very much like the aforementioned caged animal. You switch from quick prods and thrusts to full-blown swings and life-ending attempts, knowing that you must drop the man in front of you soon.\n\nEach successful defense grows the smile on Benjamin’s face. You’re both thinking the same thing. The end is near. It causes you to slash with the longsword, perhaps a bit more recklessly than your disciplined training would have liked. However, it’s now or never. Like your training warned against, such “technique,” if you can call it that, are telegraphed, easy to see coming and defend against. They also, often, bring the user off-balance by putting too much of their body into one powerful swing, as is the case here. Your slash precedes your footwork, leaving behind its sturdy foundation in the dust. Benjamin takes full advantage, attacking for the first time, drawing blood.\n\nPain appears at your side as you fall to one knee, clutching at the broadsword-sized hole just below your left ribs.\n\n“Hit me first and I’ll hit back, worse,” Benjamin says, alluding to your punch from earlier, echoing Redding’s words. He doesn’t give you the chance for a retort. His sword arm raises overhead. You close your eyes and think of home.\n"
