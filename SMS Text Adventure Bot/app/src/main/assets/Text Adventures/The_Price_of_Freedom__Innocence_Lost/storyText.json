Throwing subtlety to the wind, you shout out as fearsome a battle cry as your twelve year old throat can muster and charge towards the older boy with the axe, who turns away from Gerda to face you. The boy raises his weapon to defend himself and a deafening clang of metal against metal rings out across the arena when your sword meets his axe. Unfortunately, the boy is a lot stronger than you anticipated and the heavy weight of his battle axe sends your sword flying from your hands. Now you stand before your enemy completely defenceless.

Standing behind him, you see your timid little brother with a bloodied dagger in his hands. His face is pale white and his expression is a horrified combination of disbelief, guilt and shame. \"Alexius,\" you speak his name gently, which snaps your brother back to reality.\n\n\n\"Unknown!\" your brother cries with tears streaming down his face as he drops to the ground to hug you. Even after killing, he’s still the same, sensitive little brother you’ve protected all this time. \"I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!\" he says as he weeps onto your shoulder.\n\n\n\"What in the five rivers of hell are you sorry for?\" you ask, putting a firm hand on your brother’s shoulder in an attempt to comfort him. \"You just saved my life!\"\n\n\n\"I killed him!\" Alexius explains. \"I didn’t mean to, but he had his sword and he was going to kill you, and I had to stop him! So I took my dagger and I... But I didn’t mean to kill him!\"\n\n\n\"I know,\" you reassure your brother. \"You wouldn’t hurt anyone Alexius, I know that. But you saved me. You need to remember that, okay? If you hadn’t done what you did, I’d be dead right now, and I will never be able to thank you enough. So try to calm down, okay? The fight’s over and we’re both alive.

He was a threat to yourself, your team-mates and your little brother, and if you’d left him alive he might have killed any one of them. That doesn’t make you feel any worse about it though. This is something that’s going to haunt you for the rest of your life. The Gaul might have been a ruthless warrior, and you don’t know how many people he’s already killed or how many he’d go on to kill if you let him live.

The crowd around you is cheering for the blood spilt, but they are only watching. They’ll never understand the power you feel right now. The power to take a human life. They can fill their own lives with wine and exotic smoke and every kind of carnal pleasure man can imagine, but they’ll never feel this high that you’re feeling right now.\n\n\nThis man might be the first you kill in the arena, but he certainly won’t be the last.\n","page 703":"You don’t have the luxury of time to strategise, but you do have a good knowledge of your team-mates’ skills that you can use to your advantage.

The only difference is that now you have a dead body and a large pool of blood at your feet.\n\n\nPerhaps it will take awhile to come to terms with everything that happened today.

Still, perhaps Rhode is doing this because she respects your decision to protect your little brother.\n\n\n\"Venus, no!\" Alexius cries, throwing his arms around you and trying to pull you free from Rhode’s grip, but the woman quickly pries him away.\n\n\n\"Keep out of it!\" she tells your brother as she ties you to the post. \"Zeru, keep him back,\" she orders, dragging Alexius over to Zeru and putting his hand on your brother’s arm. \"Hold!\" she tells him firmly. Zeru doesn’t say anything, but he obediently holds Alexius back to stop him interfering.\n\n\nRhode rips your tunic open, leaving your back exposed. You hear the whip cut through the air, and then the pain comes. It’s a sharp, agonizing sting that hits you immediately, forcing you to grit your teeth together as hard as you can in a desperate attempt not to cry out. You succeed in not making a sound, but just as the initial wave of pain is starting to pass, the whip comes down again, taking you off guard and causing you to scream in pain like a dying animal. By the third lash, you’ve given up trying to keep quiet. By the fifth, you think you can feel the whip splitting your skin apart. By the eighth, your entire back feels like it’s on fire. In total, Rhode only whips you ten times, and you know she’s not putting her whole strength into the punishment. Still, the sting of the whip is so unbearable that you almost pass out from the pain.\n\n\nOnce the last of the ten lashes is over, Rhode throws the whip aside and turns away from you to addresses the rest of the students. \"I hope you all appreciate how merciful I’ve been tonight!\" she shouts, sounding incredibly stressed. \"Stealing from your masters is a crime punishable by death! I don’t care if it falls from the sky and lands in your lap, if you are caught with one of your master’s possessions, you are a thief and you will be punished as one! So next time one of you comes across a little trinket laying on the ground and considers putting it in your pocket, try to imagine what crucifixion feels like and ask yourself, is it really worth it?\" Satisfied that she’s gotten her point across, Rhode unties the ropes that bind you to the whipping post and leads you to the infirmary.\n\n\nYou are confined to your bed for the next few days while your scars heal and once they do, you’ll still be very weak. You have missed out on so much training. Sword practice, spear practice, important lessons that will sharpen your wits. Even stretching you legs is out of the question right now. It’ll take months just to get your strength back to the way it was before. Other students will surpass you. You’ll never catch up.\n\n\nWhile you recover, Alexius spends all the free time he has sitting at your side. Lula comes to the infirmary as soon as she hears about what happened and gives you a good scolding for it. \"You are stupid, stupid girl!\" she tells you, sitting at your bedside as she gently pats a damp cloth against the scars on your back. \"Why you say it you? You know I am find spin toy. Why you no tell Mistress it me?\"\n\n\n\"If I told her, she would’ve whipped you instead, and I couldn’t let her hurt Alexius, so… So I said it was me,\" you explain, feeling pretty embarrassed about it now. \"It was the only thing I could think of at the time.\"\n\n\nLula gives you a faint smile as she wipes the blood from your wounds. \"Stupid girl,\" she whispers gently. \"You never do stupid thing like that again.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Alexius.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Lula.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 Strength.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 Speed.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 Accuracy.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 Intelligence.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 Stealth.\n","page 723":"Glancing around the arena, you notice the closest enemy to you is a young girl who is heading straight towards the gladius that you had your eyes on before. Steadying your hand, you send the pilum flying through the air and the thing impales itself in the young girl’s leg, which stops her in her tracks and sends her crashing to the ground. You hear the girl screaming out in agony. She’s clearly in horrible pain, but you expect that she’ll live. More importantly, you doubt she’ll put up much of a fight with that spear in her leg. The smartest thing she could do now would be to stay out of the fight, stay low, and avoid making herself a target. In the long run, you might well have done that girl a favour.\n\n\nYour skills with the spear have benefited you in more ways than one. Not only have you badly injured an opponent to the point where they’re no longer a threat, but you can see that nobody else is heading towards that gladius in the centre of the arena. Now you can reach the weapon without anybody getting in your way.\n","page 844":"With another opponent dealt with, you head back towards Alexius and Lula with Gerda following close behind. \"Runts of the litter still not been put down yet?\" Gerda remarks when you join up with the others.\n\n\n\"Oh, shut your up Gerda,\" Lula retorts with a roll of her eyes.\n\n\n\"Stop fighting, you two!\" Alexius snaps, pointing a finger to direct your attention elsewhere. \"I think Zeru’s in trouble!\"\n\n\nWhen you turn, you see that Zeru has used his sword to quickly cut down the young boy with the bow and arrow. Unfortunately, the girl with the pike has used her team mate’s death to her advantage and silently crept up behind Zeru until she is close enough to attack. Before you have time to shout a warning, the girl attacks where Zeru has no armour to protect him, shoving her pike straight into the back of his neck.\n\n\nZeru lets out a cry of agony as he drops to his knees, and before he passes out from the pain, he turns to see the girl that attacked him. As one final act before his soul moves on to the next life, Zeru uses the last of his strength to hurl his sword at the girl, cutting her straight across her face. The girl screams out loud as she uses her hands to cover her eyes and blindly stumbles away. The girl will live, at least long enough to make it to a healer, but judging by the amount of blood spilling through her fingers, she will be in too much pain to fight for the rest of the battle. After seeing to it that you and the rest of your companions have one less enemy to fight, Zeru collapses to the ground, never to rise again.\n\n\nZeru is dead.\n\n\n\"... Well fuck,\" Gerda whispers to herself as she stares at Zeru’s lifeless body.\n\n\n\"Fuck very much,\" Lula agrees with Gerda for once. Zeru was by far the strongest and most experienced fighter on your team. You may not be able to win without him. Taking a deep breath, Lula tries to regather her optimism for the rest of the team. \"It okay. We still win. Many we fight being dead or no get up. We only one dead and all rest are safe in group.\"\n\n\n\"No we’re not,\" your brother nervously points out. \"Where’s Brasus?\"\n","page 965":"Rhode, on the other hand, while completely merciless during training, seems to be the only spectator in the audience that isn’t cheering for the loss of human life. On the contrary, her eyes seem to be looking between Gerda and Zeru before finally falling on you and gifting you with a rarely seen smile. You think you understand why. When she sent you all into the arena, she’d prepared herself for the possibility, and maybe even expected to lose you all. Both Gerda and Zeru came close to death today, and perhaps neither of them would have survived if you hadn’t been there to help them. You have her genuine appreciation for that.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Rhode.\n","page 601":"\"It wasn’t him!\" you object before Rhode can bring the whip down. All eyes turn to you, and you awkwardly look down at the ground. You know what’s going to happen when you tell the truth, but it has to be done. \"Lula found it.\"\n\n\nThere is a pause of silence before Rhode walks over to you, placing her hand on your shoulder and making you look into her eyes. \"You’re sure?\" she asks.\n\n\nYou nod your head. \"She gave it to Alexius as a present for the festival. He didn’t know where she got it from. It’s not his fault.\"\n\n\nRhode lets out a heavy sigh and goes to untie Alexius from the whipping post before heading to the practice yard to find Lula. Your brother runs over to you, wrapping his arms around you as tears roll down his cheeks. \"Thank you!\" he cries. \"Thank you for saving me, Venus! I was so scared!\"\n\n\nMoments later Rhode returns, dragging a very agitated Lula behind her. \"Hey!\" Lula shouts. \"Where we go? Ow! Let go my hair! Is only silly toy I find! No one care I take!\" The seriousness of the situation doesn’t seem to dawn on Lula until she sees the whipping post. \"… Oh fuck,\" the girl whispers and tries to make a break for it, but Rhode’s grip stays firm until she finally gets Lula to the post and binds her to it.\n\n\n\"Go on then!\" Lula shouts in a tone that sounds like a challenge. \"You do the whip! I no care! Hit as hard you can! Nothing hurt me!\" Rhode doesn’t seem affected by anything the girl says and simply rips her tunic open, leaving her back exposed.\n\n\nThere is a brief moment of silence before Lula speaks again. \"Well? Why you wait? Hurry you up and…\" the girl’s words are cut off when Rhode brings the whip down across her back. After that, there are no more words from Lula, only horrible, almost inhuman screams.\n\n\nYou turn away, looking at the ground while it goes on. In total, Rhode only whips Lula ten times, and you know she’s not putting her whole strength into the punishment. Still, judging by the girl’s screams you’d swear she was burning in the deepest pit of hell.\n\n\nOnce the last of the ten lashes is over, Rhode throws the whip aside and addresses the rest of you. \"I hope you all appreciate how merciful I’ve been tonight!\" she shouts, sounding incredibly stressed. \"Stealing from your masters is a crime punishable by death! I don’t care if it falls from the sky and lands in your lap, if you are caught with one of your master’s possessions, you are a thief and you will be punished as one! So next time one of you comes across a little trinket laying on the ground and considers putting it in your pocket, try to imagine what crucifixion feels like and ask yourself, is it really worth it?\" Satisfied that Lula has learned her lesson, Rhode unties the ropes that bind her to the whipping post and leads her to the infirmary.\n\n\nYou don’t see Lula for a few days after that, and when she’s healed enough to leave the infirmary, she avoids you for half the day before finally approaching you with folded arms and a glare that could cut through stone. \"I no talk to you,\" she tells you, in case you didn’t get the message. It doesn’t last long though, since Lula’s far too chatty to effectively pull off the silent treatment. \"You tell her,\" she says accusingly. \"You tell Mistress I take spin toy.\"\n\n\n\"You did take the toy,\" you point out, but of course that doesn’t make Lula any less angry. \"Look, Rhode saw Alexius playing with the toy. She thought he’d stolen it. She was going to give him a whipping for it, had him tied to the post and everything! Would you rather she’d have whipped him instead?\"\n\n\n\"No!\" Lula says crossly, annoyed that she can’t really argue with that. \"You know what? No mind,\" she tells you, stubbornly turning away. \"I no care anyway.\" But of course, she does care, and she’ll be upset about it for a very long time.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Alexius.\n\n\nYou have lost 10 approval with Lula.\n","page 722":"\"Zeru!\" you call out to the older boy. As he turns to you, you throw the pilum in his direction. This doesn’t do much good though, since your aim is completely off. When you throw the long spear, you lose your footing, causing the thing to go flying at a completely wrong angle, nowhere near the direction that Zeru is heading. You catch Zeru rolling his eyes at you, annoyed that you distracted him when he has a battle to focus on. With that out of the way, he carries on running towards the centre of the arena to find a different weapon.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Zeru.\n\n\nWell, that was a complete waste of time, and now you need to get another weapon for yourself. The sica and the gladius still haven’t been taken, but you’ve lost precious seconds trying to get Zeru that spear, and you’ll have to be even quicker if you want to reach the gladius in time.\n","page 843":"With another opponent dealt with, you head back towards Alexius and Lula with Gerda following close behind. \"Runts of the litter still not been put down yet?\" Gerda remarks when you join up with the others.\n\n\n\"Oh, shut your up Gerda,\" Lula retorts with a roll of her eyes.\n\n\n\"Stop fighting, you two!\" Alexius snaps, pointing a finger to direct your attention elsewhere. \"I think Zeru’s in trouble!\"\n\n\nWhen you turn, you see that Zeru is locked in combat with the older girl you saw trying to sneak up on him earlier. The two are using their weapons in much the same way that you fight with practice swords during training, both using the wooden hilts of the pike and spear, deflecting one another in an attempt to avoid the pointed tips that could mean their death. But the girl has lost the advantage of stealth, and when matched in close combat, Zeru is by far the stronger. Pushing forward, your ally uses the hilt of his spear to knock the girl with the pike to the ground, and once she’s down, he thrusts the tip of his spear through her throat before she can rise again.\n\n\n\"This fight is turn good,\" Lula remarks with a confident smile as Zeru walks over to join the rest of you. \"Many we fight being dead or no get up, but we are being none dead and all safe in group.\"\n\n\n\"No we’re not,\" your brother nervously points out. \"Where’s Brasus?\"\n","page 604":"It’s been almost a year since the incident at the festival.

She must be about the same age as Alexius. Very small and very pretty, with olive skin and long, dark hair hanging in braids on either side of her head. This must be one of the three children that Titus chose to oppose you. You can see that she’s struggling to even hold up the sword, as it’s far too heavy for a child her size. Even with a weapon in her hands, this little girl doesn’t look like she could do much harm to anyone... She proves you wrong.\n\n\nLifting the sword up high, the girl swings it with all her strength, slicing you across the throat as she does so. The last thing you see is a thick, red pool of your own blood forming on the ground beneath you. Then everything goes black.\n\n\nYou have died.\n","page 835":"With another opponent dealt with, you head back towards Alexius and Lula with Gerda following close behind. \"Runts of the litter still not been put down yet?\" Gerda remarks when you join up with the others.\n\n\n\"Oh, shut your up Gerda,\" Lula retorts with a roll of her eyes.\n\n\n\"Stop fighting, you two!\" Alexius snaps, pointing a finger to direct your attention elsewhere. \"I think Zeru’s in trouble!\"\n\n\nWhen you turn, you see that Zeru has used his sword to quickly cut down the young boy with the bow and arrow. Unfortunately, the girl with the pike has used her team mate’s death to her advantage and silently crept up behind Zeru until she is close enough to attack. Before you have time to shout a warning, the girl attacks where Zeru has no armour to protect him, shoving her pike straight into the back of his neck.\n\n\nZeru lets out a cry of agony as he drops to his knees, and before he passes out from the pain, he turns to see the girl that attacked him. As one final act before his soul moves on to the next life, Zeru uses the last of his strength to hurl his sword at the girl, cutting her straight across her face. The girl screams out loud as she uses her hands to cover her eyes and blindly stumbles away. The girl will live, at least long enough to make it to a healer, but judging by the amount of blood spilling through her fingers, she will be in too much pain to fight for the rest of the battle. After seeing to it that you and the rest of your companions have one less enemy to fight, Zeru collapses to the ground, never to rise again.\n\n\nZeru is dead.\n\n\n\"... Well fuck,\" Gerda whispers to herself as she stares at Zeru’s lifeless body.\n\n\n\"Fuck very much,\" Lula agrees with Gerda for once. Zeru was by far the strongest and most experienced fighter on your team. You may not be able to win without him. Taking a deep breath, Lula tries to regather her optimism for the rest of the team. \"It okay. We still win. Many we fight being dead or no get up. We only one dead and all rest are safe in group.\"\n\n\n\"No we’re not,\" your brother nervously points out. \"Where’s Brasus?\"\n","page 713":"You run towards the sica as fast as you can.

The two are using their weapons in much the same way that you fight with practice swords during training, both using the wooden hilts of the pike and spear, deflecting one another in an attempt to avoid the pointed tips that could mean their death. But the girl has lost the advantage of stealth, and when matched in close combat, Zeru is by far the stronger. Pushing forward, your ally uses the hilt of his spear to knock the girl with the pike to the ground, and once she’s down, he thrusts the tip of his spear through her throat before she can rise again.\n\n\n\"This fight is turn good,\" Lula remarks with a confident smile as Zeru walks over to join the rest of you. \"Many we fight being dead or no get up, but we are being none dead and all safe in group.\"\n\n\n\"No we’re not,\" your brother nervously points out. \"Where’s Brasus?\"\n","page 955":"Suddenly, the rest of the world returns.

They can’t make me do anything. Can’t you see Alexius? This is what it means to really be free! They might kill me, but I’ll still die my own way, making my own choices. I’ll die free. Nothing’s more important than that.\"\n\n\n\"... Venus,\" Alexius just stares at you, lost for words. You can’t tell whether he’s been taken in by what you said, or whether he’s simply given up trying to convince you. Unfortunately, you will never know what your brother was really thinking.\n\n\n\"Look out!\" Alexius screams at you. You turn to see one of your opponents, an older boy who looks almost a man, has noticed you standing there without a weapon, and decided you’d make an easy kill. He is holding a heavy spatha broadsword in his hands and swings it to the side as he charges towards you, ready to cut you down. He has a cruel smile on his face that shows that, even though you’re showing no resistance, he’s still going to enjoy the kill.\n\n\nYou have nothing to defend yourself with, but your brother, armed only with his little dagger, throws himself in front of you and charges towards your attacker with his dagger extended. It is all for nothing. Your older and far more experienced opponent waits just long enough for Alexius to get in range before swinging his broadsword across Alexius’s neck. The blade cuts through skin, blood and bone in a single swoop.\n\n\nThe severed head of your little brother rolls across the ground, stopping just in front of your feet. Blood pours from his neck and stains the sand beneath you, but your gaze is locked on your brother’s eyes. You can do nothing but stare at the wide, terrified look on Alexius’s face, frozen forever from the last moment he was alive. This is the last thing you ever see.

Boys on the left, girls on the right, and quick about it!\" You and the rest of the students quickly fall into place, with you being one of the shorter girls. Once you’re all lined up, Titus and the intimidating stranger walk up and down the line, inspecting you all. Eventually, the stranger stops and stands in front of Brasus, who is looking down at the ground to avoid eye contact.\n\n\n\"You, boy, stand up straight!\" the man shouts at him. \"Heels together hands by your sides, and bloody look at me when I’m talking to you!\" Brasus is very quick to follow all of these commands at once, looking extremely terrified as he does so. The stranger just scoffs at him and turns to Titus. \"Pale and trembling as a first time whore. I’m surprised he hasn’t pissed himself already. I suppose we have your woman to thank for that,\" he says as he gestures to Rhode, who manages to maintain an icy glare at the man without stepping out of line to defend herself. \"You inherit Rome’s greatest gladiator academy, and then give the students a mother to coddle them.\"\n\n\nTitus laughs sincerely at this. \"Coddle them? Cato, that bitch is more vicious than the pair of us put together, and you know that as well as I do!\" It might not have been intended as a compliment, but you think you catch a hint of a smile on Rhode’s face when he describes her as such.\n\n\nThe man that Titus calls Cato doesn’t argue, and simply pulls Brasus away from the rest of the group. \"This one,\" he says, pushing the boy towards Rhode and leaving him standing there, panic-stricken, with no idea what he’s been selected for.\n\n\nTitus similarly inspects the group, though he concentrates more on the older, stronger boys. \"Ah, I remember you,\" he says when he gets to Zeru. \"It was the last time I came to inspect you all, wasn’t it? You struck that other lad’s practice sword so hard the bloody thing snapped clean in half. I’ll have this one,\" Titus decides, sending Zeru to take his place next to Brasus.\n\n\nCato now makes his way towards the girl’s line. There are only half a dozen female children in the academy, of which Lula has the misfortune of being the smallest. \"You, girl, how old are you?\" Cato asks, to which Lula responds in her regular upbeat and chatty manner.\n\n\n\"Not know,\" the girl admits. \"Am think ten, but maybe tenty one.\" The man doesn’t look impressed by Lula’s poor attempt at speaking Latin and pulls her from the crowd, sending her over to Rhode. Lula doesn’t seem particularly daunted by this though. \"What I win?\" she asks, to which Rhode smacks her across the head to shut her up.\n\n\nRather than inspecting you all again, Titus directs his attention to your tutor. \"Rhode, which one’s the javelin thrower?\" he asks. \"The one you said hit a mouse from half way across the practice yard.\"\n\n\nRhode hesitates, as if she doesn’t want to say, but ever obedient to her master, she gestures towards Gerda. The yellow-haired girl stands straight and proud, as if hoping to be chosen. \"Yes, I’ll have her,\" Titus says confidently, and Gerda steps forward to join the others.\n\n\nCato starts inspecting the younger students once more, and his eyes linger on Alexius for an uncomfortably long time. Eventually, he grabs hold of your brother, wrapping his hand around the boy’s upper arm. \"Still scrawny,\" he observes. \"How long have you been training here, boy?\"\n\n\nTo his credit, Alexius doesn’t flinch and does his best to keep any hint of fear from his voice when he answers. \"About a year and a half, sir.\"\n\n\nThe man continues to study your brother for awhile before giving him a shove on the back, sending him Rhode’s way. \"He’ll do,\" Cato decides, turning back to Titus. \"One more,\" he tells your master. \"Better make it count.\"\n","page 866":"Note: This game is an update of the original version of The Price of Freedom: Innocence Lost, published in 2014.

For awhile, Titus studies you with an uncertain expression on his face, like a dice player deciding whether or not to gamble all his money on a very risky roll. You can tell what’s coming though. After all, if your master wasn’t a gambling man, he never would’ve bought you in the first place. \"I did say I’d keep you two as a pair, didn’t I?\" he asks with a faint smile. \"Well, I’ll have no one say that I’m not a man of my word.\"\n\n\nThe scarred man, Cato, looks disturbingly amused by Titus’s choice.

The students look completely shocked, including you. This is a side of your master that you’ve never seen before, he suddenly just snapped. There is a ruthless glare in his eyes that doesn’t just make him look angry or intimidating, but genuinely dangerous. \"Learn when to hold your tongue, woman!\" he shouts at Rhode. \"I’ve made my choice. Do not question me again!\" With that, he forcefully pushes your tutor away. Rhode rubs her neck where Titus grabbed her, but her stoic expression remains the same. There is no indication whatsoever that she was surprised by Titus’s sudden outburst. Apparently she, if no one else, has seen this side of him before.\n\n\nWith the last selection made and your master’s brief tirade over, Titus strides out of the arena with Cato following close behind. This leaves a group of confused students all looking to Rhode for some kind of explanation. Of course, with Titus and the other man gone, Rhode is free to say whatever she wants and she does so as loudly and angrily as physically possible. \"The fuck are you all staring at? Get back to training before I get the whip out again!\" This sends the other children scattering, leaving you and the five other chosen students alone with a very frustrated tutor. \"The six of you come with me,\" she tells you, stressfully rubbing her hand over her shaven head. \"This is going to be a bloody long day.\"\n","page 747":"You run towards the sica as fast as you can.

She is doing her best to dodge the heavy battle axe, but Gerda only has a short javelin to fight back with, and she can’t get close enough to do any damage. Gerda waits for the boy to tire himself out and then, when he can barely lift the axe any more, she strikes! Quickly jumping in with her javelin, the girl spears the boy right in the centre of his throat. Unfortunately, in order to get close enough to attack the boy, Gerda brings herself right into the range of the boy’s axe, and just as she delivers the killing blow, the boy also swings his axe, cutting deeply into the side of Gerda’s head.\n\nGerda wails in agony as she drops to the ground, her hands covering her face as she and the boy lie side by side in a pool of their combined blood.

You are all seated, watching as Rhode paces the length of the room, waiting with bated breath for her to break the silence. This must be the first time you’ve ever seen your tutor lost for words.\n\n\n\"I think most of you understand why you’re here,\" she finally says. \"The long version is that Master Titus and Cato, that degenerate bastard you all had the pleasure of meeting earlier, had some juvenile disagreement.

Gerda waits for the boy to tire himself out and then, when he can barely lift the axe any more, she strikes! Quickly jumping in with her javelin, the girl spears the boy right in the centre of his throat. Unfortunately, in order to get close enough to attack the boy, Gerda brings herself right into the range of the boy’s axe, and just as she delivers the killing blow, the boy also swings his axe, cutting deeply into the side of Gerda’s head.\n\nGerda wails in agony as she drops to the ground, her hands covering her face as she and the boy lie side by side in a pool of their combined blood. You see her body twitching for a few moments and then she goes still, never to move again.\n\n\nGerda is dead.\n\n\n\"Oh fuck,\" Lula whispers to herself. You know the two girls never got along, but Gerda was by far the most ruthless fighter on your team and the most talented with ranged weapons. You may not be able to win without her. Taking a deep breath, Lula tries to regather her optimism for the rest of the team. \"It okay. We still win. Many we fight being dead or no get up. We only one dead and all rest are safe in group.\"\n\n\n\"No we’re not,\" your brother nervously points out. \"Where’s Brasus?\"\n","page 610":"Sword fighting is easily the most prominent part of your training, and it shows.

Lula doesn’t seem particularly daunted by this though. \"What I win?\" she asks, to which Rhode smacks her across the head to shut her up.\n\n\nRather than inspecting you all again, Titus directs his attention to your tutor. \"Rhode, which one’s the javelin thrower?\" he asks. \"The one you said hit a mouse from half way across the practice yard.\"\n\n\nRhode hesitates, as if she doesn’t want to say, but ever obedient to her master, she gestures towards Gerda. The yellow-haired girl stands straight and proud, as if hoping to be chosen. \"Yes, I’ll have her,\" Titus says confidently, and Gerda steps forward to join the others.\n\n\nCato starts inspecting the younger students once more, and his eyes linger on Alexius for an uncomfortably long time. Eventually, he grabs hold of your brother, wrapping his hand around the boy’s upper arm. \"Still scrawny,\" he observes. \"How long have you been training here, boy?\"\n\n\nTo his credit, Alexius doesn’t flinch and does his best to keep any hint of fear from his voice when he answers. \"About a year and a half, sir.\"\n\n\nThe man continues to study your brother for awhile before giving him a shove on the back, sending him Rhode’s way. \"He’ll do,\" Cato decides, turning back to Titus. \"One more,\" he tells your master. \"Better make it count.\"\n","page 739":"You run towards the sica as fast as you can.

She must be about the same age as Alexius. Very small and very pretty, with olive skin and long, dark hair hanging in braids on either side of her head. This must be one of the three children that Titus chose to oppose you. You can see that she’s struggling to even hold up the sword, as it’s far too heavy for a child her size.

The older, Ethiopian boy who was training with the wooden swords earlier is there too, drawing the bucket up from the well and filling up a water skin to drink from. \"Hey, can I get some water?\" you ask him, but the boy doesn’t even look at you, instead, taking his own water skin and drinking heavily from it. \"I could really use a drink,\" you ask again.\n\n\nThis time, the boy at least turns to acknowledge you.

Their grip isn’t strong, but it takes you off guard and you turn around to see who the hand belongs to. What you see is even more surprising, a girl about your own age, who, judging by her apparel, doesn’t have any business in an academy for slaves. Her toga is pure silk, and so perfectly white, you doubt it’s even been worn before today.

Looking over her shoulder, she turns her attention to Brasus. \"You, boy, could you go to the well and get me some water to clean this boy’s cut with?\"\n\n\n\"I...

You give out a cry as the cane hits you. It doesn’t cut the skin, but it still stings like hell. With that, the slaver makes his way to the front of the cart, satisfied his point has been made. He gives the reins a sharp tug and the donkey moves slowly forward. \n\n\nLowering his voice so that the slaver can’t hear, your brother edges closer to you. \"What are we going to do, Venus?\" he asks, as if somehow you have all the answers. \"How can we get back home?\" \n\n\nA tear runs down your cheek as you shake your head. \"We can’t,\" you tell your brother, watching your house slowly fade away into the darkness. \"We don’t have a home any more.\"\n","page 485":"\"Hang on, Venus, I’ve got something for you!\" Alexius calls after you before you leave.

You consider trying to escape, but you don’t know where you are or where you’d go even if you did manage to get away. Your mother is dead and you could never go back to your father after what he did to you. Alexius is all you have left in the world and he’s right here with you.\n\n\nJust as the sun is rising, you arrive at the city of Pylos. The cart is moving slowly along a road by the sea and you see a small group of children playing in the rock-pools, using old, broken fishing nets to catch shrimp, crabs and little fishes. A couple of the children catch sight of you as the cart passes by, but quickly avert their eyes and go back to their games. That used to be you. Yesterday you were free, and slavery was just something that existed. You’d never really given much thought to whether it was right or wrong. Some people were slaves and some people were free, and that’s just how the world worked. You only realised the injustice of it once the rope was around your own wrists.\n\n\nStopping the cart by the docks, the Roman slaver that bought you approaches a merchant trader, who seems to be buying the healthiest looking slaves he can get his hands on. The slaver offers to sell you to the merchant for a price that the merchant refuses. He gradually lowers the price, trying to make a sale. All the while he talks about how you and Alexius are so strong and intelligent, and claims that you’re both younger than you actually are, trying to convince the merchant you’re tall for your age. In the end, the men both settle for a price that neither of them seem particularly happy with. With the coin in his pocket, the slaver climbs back into his cart, grumbling that the pair of you weren’t worth the trouble it took to get you there and drives away without so much as glancing back. You’re handed over to one of the merchant’s servants who replaces your ropes with shackles and leads you down to the docks.\n\n\nYou remember seeing the ships with your father when you were younger. You’d stare up in amazement at the big trading vessels, with sails that towered up to the sky like great, fabric clouds floating over the water. You were fascinated with those ships when you were Alexius’s age, but as you draw closer, you feel a disturbing knot in your stomach, like something is horribly, horribly wrong.\n\n\nThat’s when you see them. Long lines of slaves, chained together. People of all countries and cultures. Greeks like yourself, fearsome warriors from Gaul and exotic slaves all the way from Ethiopia, with dark skin and nothing but a piece of cloth tied between their legs to preserve their modesty. That’s where you’re headed.

Your mother got weaker, thinner, paler.\n\n\nShe cried a lot and was in pain most of the time.

While his lessons don’t appear to be mandatory, you do learn a little about what to expect in the arena and how to impress the crowds. You also learn a little about the different weapons used in the arena and their advantages and disadvantages.

The adult slaves are drinking and laughing and generally having the greatest night of their lives, while the children, just for one day, get to act like children again.\n\n\nAs the festival is such a special occasion, you are all allowed to stay up until the early hours of the morning.

Where did you get it?\" Rhode snaps.\n\n\nAlexius is quiet for a moment, presumably contemplating what answer is going to cause the least amount of trouble. \"… I found it,\" is the less than convincing answer he decides upon. Unfortunately, Rhode doesn’t seem satisfied.\n\n\n\"Is that so?\" she asks, grabbing Alexius by his tunic and pulling him up to his feet. \"Because the last time your Master visited the academy, his daughter Caecilia said she lost a toy just like this one. Are you telling me you found your Mistress’s toy and decided to keep it for yourself?\"\n\n\nAlexius is terrified and can’t seem to think clearly enough to come up with a clever reply. \"No!\" he blurts out. \"I mean yes… I don’t remember!\"\n","page 596":"What do you want to do?\n","page 1117":"As Caecilia leaves, Rhode turns back to you. \"Unknown, Alexius, the Master’s waiting for you.

I was throwing spears and... I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry!\"\n\n\nWell, that explains it.

As you pick out a practice sword with a decent length and weight, the older, Ethiopian boy takes notice of you and signals you over to spar with him. Rather than getting any introductions out of the way, the boy hits you so hard across the knuckles that you’re forced to drop your sword.\n\n\nCursing under your breath, you pick the weapon back up again and concentrate on deflecting the boy’s next attack. The training goes on for several minutes, and your sparring partner is completely relentless. You gain several nasty bruises that you are sure to feel in the morning, and don’t even manage to land a single hit against your opponent. Still, all this training is necessary if you’re ever going to get stronger.

Grabbing him roughly by the arm, she drags Alexius outside. You and most of the other students race out of the dining hall to see what’s happening. Rhode takes Alexius to a large, wooden post stuck in the ground, with ropes tied around it. You’ve probably walked past this post every day since you came to the academy, but you have no idea what it is, or what it’s for. Unfortunately, you’re about to find out.\n\n\n\"Hands,\" Rhode orders your brother, who nervously but obediently holds his hands up to her. Taking hold of them, Rhode uses the ropes to tie Alexius’s hands to the pole. Catching sight of one of the guards, Rhode calls over to him. \"You, go to the weapons room and tell them I sent you,\" she orders him. \"Bring me the flagrum.\"\n\n\nThe guard looks at Alexius with pity, and while he might not be happy about it, he follows Rhode’s command. When he returns, he’s carrying a tool with a wooden handle fastened to several rawhide thongs with small metal beads tied to the ends. More specifically, a very nasty looking whip.\n\n\n\"No!\" your brother screams out, desperately pulling against his restraints and going white with fear. \"No, please! I didn’t take it! I promise, it wasn’t me!\" he wails, turning to you with tears in his eyes. \"Venus!\" he begs. \"Venus, tell her! Tell her it wasn’t me!\"\n\n\nIt wasn’t him. Lula gave him that toy. From your time together on the ship to Rome, you know that Lula has a finders keepers attitude towards other people’s possessions. She probably never even considered handing it in. You expect to hear an objection from Lula, but Alexius’s cries of distress are met by silence. You look around and Lula is nowhere to be seen. She must still be playing games in the practice yard, which leaves only you to speak out on your brother’s behalf.\n\n\nNow you’re faced with a dilemma. Do you hand Lula over to save your brother, or do you stay quiet and let Alexius take the punishment?\n","page 1115":"\"Hey, slave!\" Septimus calls cruelly, clutching at the bars of the gate with a smirk on his face. \"Still alive?\" he asks snidely. \"You’re lucky you had all your little friends around to protect you.

I’d like to see how long you’d last in the arena on your own, wouldn’t you, Caecilia?\"\n\n\n\"No I wouldn’t!\" Caecilia snaps, looking very angry at her brother. \"You know I hate watching those fights, I thought I was going to be sick! Besides, could’ve gotten hurt!\" she says, gesturing to you.\n\n\n\"Of course could’ve gotten hurt, that’s the whole point!\" Septimus points out. \"It wouldn’t be much of a fight if nobody got hurt. Besides, dying in the arena is an honourable death.\" \n\n\n\"Well, not going to die!\" Caecilia says stubbornly. \"I’m going to tell Papa to set free! I’ll tell him every day for the rest of my life if I have to. This never going to be in another fight again!\"\n\n\nSeptimus rolls his eyes at his sister’s comment. \"Papa’s not going to free just because you say so, don’t be so stupid,\" he tells Caecilia before walking away.\n\n\nThe girl is quiet for a moment while her brother leaves, and then lowers her voice to speak directly to you. \"I’m not being stupid. I hated watching you fight down there. I was so worried for you, and I’m so glad you’re okay. Even if all those other children had to die, I’m glad that you survived. Just keep fighting. Papa always does what I say in the end. I promise, one day, I’ll get him to set you free.\"\n\n\n\"That’s enough of that, little Mistress,\" you hear Rhode say as she approaches you from behind and fixes a hand firmly on your shoulder. \"Don’t go filling Unknown’s head up with ideas like that.

I’ll do anything you want, but don’t let him take us! I love you Papa, please don’t let the man take us away!\" \n\n\nYour father never even looks up at you. His head is cupped in his hands to avoid meeting your eyes as you make your desperate plea for a second chance. \"You don’t understand, Venus,\" he tells you. You can hear his voice cracking up, but he’s trying to explain this to you as calmly as he can. \"I just can’t look after you any more, or your brother either. I don’t have the money. This is the best thing I can do for you. Life will be safer in Rome, people will look after you there. You won’t have to worry about going hungry or getting thrown out of your home. You’ll have a better life.\" \n\n\n\"I don’t want a better life!\" you yell with tears streaming down your eyes. \"I want to stay with you!\" \n\n\nYour father looks like he’s trying to think of something to say to you, but can’t seem to find the words. All he does is cry into his hands until the slaver finally returns. \"I’m so sorry, Venus,\" he tells you as the slaver pulls you away. \"I’m sorry I couldn’t be a better father.\" Finally your father takes his hands away from his face and looks up at you with red, tearful eyes. \"Promise you’ll look after your brother for me. I love you!\" \n\n\n\"Papa, please!\" you continue to cry as you’re dragged out of the door, but your pleas go ignored. Your father doesn’t come for you.\n","page 237":"\"You two do what you want,\" you tell them, sulkily walking away. \"I’m not jumping through hoops for that crazy, bald lady. She might think that she can snap her fingers and I’ll do whatever she wants, but she’s wrong.\" Whilst the other pupils are training hard, you sit on the ground, watching them, gritting your teeth at the injustice of it all. You’re not a slave! Why should your father have the right to sell you? Why should a slaver have the right to take you away from everything you ever knew? Why should anyone have the right to throw you in an arena and tell you to fight or be killed? It isn’t right, and you refuse to be their puppet.\n\n\nYour protests go largely unnoticed, though. Rhode hasn’t arrived yet and the other students just ignore you. They’re too busy with their own training to pay you any attention.\n","page 479":"\"How are you coping?\" you ask your brother, \"I know we’ve been here awhile now, but this place is so different from anything else we’re used to. I just want to make sure you’re okay.\"\n\n\n\"I don’t know. I think I’m starting to get used to things here, but I don’t really want to,\" Alexius admits, sadly. \"I try to train hard and get stronger, but I never do anything good enough, and Mistress is always mad at me. I’m always scared I’ll do something wrong and she’ll hit me or shout at me. I’m scared all the time, Venus. I’m scared of Mistress and the other students, and I’m scared of being a gladiator. I just... I don’t want to die. I keep hoping that one day we can just leave and go somewhere far, far away where they’ll never find us.\"\n\n\n\"Shh!\" you scold Alexius. \"Be careful saying things like that.

I mean, I know none of you are real gladiators yet, but you sure as hell fight like you are! Damn, it must’ve been so exciting! You didn’t even look scared or anything, not like that other stupid boy that got himself killed. I can’t wait to see you fight again when you’re a real gladiator. Wouldn’t that be great, Caecilia?\"\n\n\n\"No it wouldn’t!\" Caecilia snaps, looking very angry at her brother. \"You know I hate watching those fights, I thought I was going to be sick! It’s all just a bunch of wicked people killing each other for no reason!\"\n\n\n\"Of course there’s a reason!\" Septimus objects. \"To show your strength and skill and dedication, to prove your worth to the Gods!\"\n\n\n\"They’re not worth anything to the Gods!\" Caecilia shouts. \"They’re all just animals! That’s why the Gods made them slaves in the first place, because they’re not even real people!\"\n\n\nSeptimus looks genuinely angry and offended by this. \"That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard!\" he yells at his sister before walking away.\n\n\nCaecilia is quiet for a moment while her brother leaves, and then lowers her voice to speak directly to you. \"It’s not stupid. Everyone knows it. I watched that fight and it was the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen! Little children all killing each other like monsters. Are you slaves really all the same? Once you’re in the arena, do you just kill anyone and everyone that gets in your way? What about those other children you had to fight?

I run,\" she says before sprinting away.\n\n\nAlexius goes to listen to the lecture with the younger students while you head towards the blunted javelins. Taking one in your hand, you test its weight and step towards a chalk line that has been drawn across the ground. A straw figure made in the shape of a man stands on a wooden pole about thirty feet ahead of you. You imagine this is what you’re supposed to be aiming for. Taking a deep breath, you steady the javelin in your hand and send it flying through the air. Unfortunately, you stumble, and it goes in the completely wrong direction, crossing over into the lane of the fair haired girl you noticed earlier.\n\n\nThe girl scoffs and rolls her eyes at you. \"That the best you can do?\" she asks with a cruel little smirk.\n\n\nRetrieving the javelin, you take your time aiming before throwing it towards the target once more. This time, it hits the figure square in the chest, just about where the heart would be. \"Apparently not,\" you reply to the girl, causing her to look annoyed and you to feel rather pleased with yourself. You carry on training with javelins for the next half hour or so.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 Accuracy.\n","page 357":"\"Venus!\" you hear Brasus calling, waving his arms to beckon you over. \"Venus, come quick!\" You’re not sure what the problem is, but it sounds serious, so you follow the boy across the arena to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\nWhen you get there, you see Alexius sitting on the ground with a nasty, bleeding gash on his head. \"Ah, Gods!\" he cries, holding his hand over the injury. \"Venus, it really hurts!\"\n\n\n\"What happened?\" you ask, which causes Brasus to look nervously at his feet.\n\n\n\"I...\" he mumbles, sounding very guilty. \"It was an accident! I was throwing spears and... I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry!\"\n\n\nWell, that explains it.

Get much trouble.\"\n\n\n\"I won’t,\" you lie. With Lula and Alexius gone, you wander aimlessly around the practice yard for awhile, waiting until you are sure nobody is looking before hopping the fence and hiding behind the nearest building. Very slowly, you make your way around the academy, being very careful to make sure nobody sees you. Using buildings as cover, you try to find a possible escape route. There is a large wall around the academy, about twenty feet high. It won’t be easy climbing that. The only way out seems to be a ten foot high gate, but there are a pair of guards standing watch, so you can’t hope to sneak out.

It wasn’t until a few hours later that your father sat down with you and explained what had happened. You don’t remember exactly what he told you, but between your father’s ambiguous stalling and attempts at describing the afterlife, you managed to grasp a basic understanding. The baby was gone, and your mother gone with it.\n\n\nSomething inside you died that day, and your life has never been the same since. Your family has fallen apart, both as a unit and as individuals. You started avoiding your chores and instead, spent as much time with your friends and as little time with your family as possible. Alexius took the opposite approach. He became very quiet and reclusive for a boy his age, and even now, he doesn’t seem interested in making friends at all. Still, despite your premature rebellion and Alexius withdrawing into himself, it was your father who dealt with your mother’s death the worst.\n\n\nAt first it was the wine. Your father would stumble into the house late at night, so drunk he could barely stand. He wasn’t an aggressive drunk, but seeing your father so disorientated that you and your brother had to put him to bed yourselves was extremely confusing at that age. It worried you to think that your father was the only one taking care of you now, and he could barely take care of himself. A few weeks later, your father stopped working. You’re not sure if he was so depressed that he couldn’t bring himself to get out of bed in the morning, or whether he was so drunk that nobody wanted him working for them any more. Either way, your father no longer had a way to support you or your brother… That’s when the gambling started.\n","page 1119":"As Caecilia leaves, Rhode turns back to you. \"Unknown, Alexius, the Master’s waiting for you.

Or, I feel like one day Papa will feel bad and change his mind and come all the way here to take us back home. I know that’s not really going to happen, but that’s still how I feel. It’s stupid isn’t it?\"\n\n\n\"No, I know what you mean,\" you reassure your brother. \"Sometimes I feel like this isn’t really my life too. Then Rhode smacks me ‘round the head and reminds me just how real it is.\"\n\n\n\"Things will get better one day though, I’m sure they will,\" Alexius promises.\n\n\n\"How do you know that?\" you ask.\n\n\nThe boy gives his shoulders a half-hearted shrug. \"I just do.\"\n","page 242":"As the morning drags on, the heat of the summer air starts to get to you, and you head over to a well just outside the training grounds to get some water. The older, Ethiopian boy who was training with the wooden swords earlier is there too, drawing the bucket up from the well and filling up a water skin to drink from. \"Hey, can I get some water?\" you ask him, but the boy doesn’t even look at you, instead, taking his own water skin and drinking heavily from it. \"I could really use a drink,\" you ask again.\n\n\nThis time, the boy at least turns to acknowledge you. His eyes scan you up and down, as if trying to size you up, but he doesn’t pass you the bucket.\n\n\n\"Don’t you speak Latin?\" you ask him. He doesn’t reply. \"What about Greek?\" you ask in Greek.

I was throwing spears and... I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry!\"\n\n\nWell, that explains it.

It really isn’t, but he understands it’s all you have and he’s grateful. \"I used up my candle already, so at least now I won’t be bumping into things all the time when I need to use the pot at night.

You give out a cry as the cane hits you. It doesn’t cut the skin, but it still stings like hell. With that, the slaver makes his way to the front of the cart, satisfied his point has been made. He gives the reins a sharp tug and the donkey moves slowly forward. \n\n\nLowering his voice so that the slaver can’t hear, your brother edges closer to you. \"What are we going to do, Venus?\" he asks, as if somehow you have all the answers. \"How can we get back home?\" \n\n\nA tear runs down your cheek as you shake your head. \"We can’t,\" you tell your brother, watching your house slowly fade away into the darkness. \"We don’t have a home any more.\"\n","page 483":"\"Here, take this,\" you tell your brother as you pass him the comb. \"Rhode gave it to me to stop my hair getting in the way, and so I could look nice the next time Titus comes to see us.

Yes, you should always try as hard as you can to achieve this victory, but no matter how strong you are, most of you will die in battle. The most important thing I can teach you is to prepare yourself for an honourable death.\n\n\nA true gladiator accepts death with dignity. You will not flinch or cry out or beg for mercy.

No guilt or shock or any kind of bloodthirsty battle thrill. Nothing. You’re just completely numb. Perhaps the reality hasn’t sunken in yet. Honestly, it doesn’t really feel like you’ve killed anyone. All you did was lift your blade and aim for the heart, like you’ve done every day during training. The only difference is that now you have a dead body and a large pool of blood beside you.\n\n\nPerhaps it will take awhile to come to terms with everything that happened today. More likely you will never really come to terms with it, and one day killing people in the morning will just become the norm for you.

Still sleepy and rather annoyed, you sit yourself upright and lean towards the door to see what’s happening.\n\n\n\"Papa!\" Alexius is frantically shouting as he runs over to your father and clings to his arm. \"Papa, please, I don’t want to go! Don’t let the man take us away!\"\n\n\nTake you away? You have no idea what Alexius is talking about. Nobody’s taking you anywhere.

Still, as all children should, you eventually had to learn how to share. Your cot, your toys and the attention of your mother were quickly snatched away from you and given over to a smaller, cuter version of yourself.\n\n\nYou were only two years old when Alexius was born. He was such a tiny thing, curled up in your mother’s arms, but he made such a loud noise! It was like listening to a dying animal every time he got hungry or sleepy or soiled himself.

She wastes no time snatching the food away from you and eating it like some kind of starving animal, ripping off large chunks of bread with her teeth, and swallowing it before she even has time to chew it properly. Some of the adult slaves try to take the bread from her, but she cradles it in her arms and pushes, kicks or even bites at the other slaves until they leave her alone.\n\n\n\"I didn’t get any,\" Alexius tells you in a sad, hushed voice.\n\n\n\"I know,\" you tell him. \"Neither did I.

You have no idea how long Lula’s gone without a proper meal.\n\n\nFor a moment, Lula just stares at you blankly, a look of sheer admiration in her eyes, as if it had been so long since anyone showed her compassion, she’d completely forgotten it ever existed. \"I am thank you, you good childs. We friends now, yes? Until we go different way, I am look after you. I no let no one hit you or take you food away. Someone hurt you, you tell me.

For those of you that have been here awhile, it seems some of you are forgetting what I’ve been teaching you from the start. Pay attention, because if I have to repeat this again, there will be consequences! Now, can somebody tell me, what is the most important part of a gladiator’s life?\"\n\n\nSilence falls across the practice yard. By the way the students are looking at each other, you can tell they all know the answer, they just don’t want to give it. Eventually, Gerda steps forward and shouts her answer out clearly, so that everyone can hear. \"Their death, Mistress!\"\n\n\n\"Exactly,\" Rhode replies. \"Some of you might think you can avoid death. I am telling you now that every one of you here is going to die. Whether it’s in the arena, or in your beds when you’re a hundred years old, you’re all going to die. As gladiators though, most of you will not live to see thirty years. For some of you, that means half your lives have already past. I’d say it’s about time you start thinking about how you want to die.\n\n\nYes, there is honour in victory. Yes, you should always try as hard as you can to achieve this victory, but no matter how strong you are, most of you will die in battle. The most important thing I can teach you is to prepare yourself for an honourable death.\n\n\nA true gladiator accepts death with dignity. You will not flinch or cry out or beg for mercy. If and when you are defeated in battle, you will kneel willingly before your opponent and lift your head to them, exposing your neck so that they may end your life with a swift stab to your throat.\n\n\nTo fight takes courage, but to die well is the most courageous act a man can ever accomplish! You will redeem yourself from the humiliation of defeat, you will receive an honourable burial and, most importantly, both the crowd and your opponent will respect you. Your lives are fleeting, but your death will remain the same for the rest of eternity. There is nothing more important than the way you die.\"\n\n\nAlexius is beside you, and after your mistress has finished her speech, your little brother looks up at you and gives a faint shake of his head. He doesn’t agree with Rhode and he doesn’t want you to either.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Rhode must’ve noticed your brother’s small gesture of defiance, because she pushes her way through the rest of the students and grabs Alexius’s chin in her hand, forcing him to look up to her. \"Do you have a problem with something I just said, boy?\" Rhode asks, glaring into his eyes.\n\n\n\"No, Mistress!\" Alexius shouts, clearly terrified of the woman and too frightened to say what he really thinks.\n\n\n\"And you?\" she asks, turning her venomous gaze your way. \"I’ve been fighting in the arena longer than you’ve been alive, but if you think you know better than me, please share your thoughts with the rest of the class. I’m sure we’ll all be enlightened by whatever you have to teach us.\"\n\n\nWell, that’s just not fair! Alexius was the one who disagreed with her, but for some reason, you’re the one that’s in trouble. Still, everybody is staring at you now. You’re going to have to say something.\n","page 273":"\"Yes, Mistress, I do think I know better!\" you tell Rhode fearlessly, causing every other student in the practice yard to fall deathly silent as they stare at you. \"When a gladiator just kneels down and lets their enemy kill them, it’s not because they’re brave, it’s because they’ve given up! They’re weak and tired, and their opponent’s stronger than them, so it’s easier to just give up and die than to get back up and keep fighting. Well, that’s not going to happen to me! You tell the others whatever you want, but I’m not giving up! Not now, not ever!\"\n\n\nYour answer is spoken with such conviction that Rhode is rendered speechless for a moment. It’s hard to tell, but she almost looks impressed. \"I don’t know whether to admire your guts or to smack you senseless for your stupidity.\" Unfortunately for you, she decides on the latter and quickly backhands you across the face, so hard that it sends you falling to the ground. \"I have killed men for less than that!\" she warns you, sounding extremely serious about her threat. \"Never disrespect me again!\"\n\n\nAs Rhode storms away, the rest of the children start scattering and get back to their training. While you sit up and rub the side of your face, you realise something interesting. Rhode didn’t actually scold you for your opinion, only for voicing it out loud. Perhaps she actually respects your opinion… Maybe even agrees with it herself.\n\n\nGerda, on the other hand, clearly doesn’t respect your opinion, as you catch her rolling her eyes at you before getting back to her training.\n\n\n\"Why’d you have to say that?\" Alexius asks timidly, as he sits down at your side. \"Now she’s going to be mad at you forever!\"\n\n\n\"Was worth it,\" Lula says with a cheeky grin across her face as she takes your hand and pulls you to your feet. \"Mistress is do what she want and nobody is say nothing back. Now she know you are fighter. Is good you tell her off. Maybe no do again though. Not want her for to kill you.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Lula.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Gerda.\n","page 394":"There is silence for a moment before your brother speaks up. \"Yes, ma’am,\" he admits, sounding quite ashamed. \"We didn’t use to be, but… Well… Now we are.\"\n\n\nCaecilia seems a little saddened by this. \"So, you weren’t always slaves?\" she asks timidly. \"The lady who dresses me and brushes my hair is a slave, but she says she was born like that.

I need to eat too, you know?\"\n\n\nNot having caught anything herself, Lula sits down next to you. \"She right. You listen you sister,\" she tells Alexius. \"When we on boat, no help. You feed you self. Stand up when men come. Jump high. Steal food if can. No ask help. No one help you here.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 5 Strength.\n","page 272":"\"No, Mistress!

I’m grateful for what you taught me, Mistress, and I promise to be brave when I die.\"\n\n\nYour answer spoken with so much conviction that it seems to take Rhode off guard. For a second, it even looks as though she’s disappointed with your response, but she quickly shrugs it off and manages a smile. \"Good to know,\" she says quietly before lifting her voice so the other students can hear. \"Everybody, remember what Venus here just said! This is exactly the kind of attitude I want to see from the rest of you! If you can’t take a beating in the practice yard, then you’re worth nothing more than lion meat in the arena!

While the other students head off to resume their training, you think you catch Gerda looking at you for a moment, with what you can only assume is some small degree of respect. Apparently, she found your little speech impressive.\n\n\nAlexius doesn’t look quite so impressed though. He stares at the ground to avoid looking at you, and waits for the other children to move away before speaking. \"I don’t want you to be brave when you die,\" he says quietly, before walking away.

I’m just stuck here until that happens.\"\n\n\n\"Oh…\" Caecilia mumbles, not sure what to make of your unique opinion. \"So, you weren’t always slaves?\" she asks timidly. \"The lady who dresses me and brushes my hair is a slave, but she says she was born like that. I mean, I know not everybody who’s a slave starts out that way, but…\"\n","page 275":"You know full well you’re going to regret this, but you take a deep breath and say it anyway. \"Mistress, I don’t believe in anything you just said and you don’t believe it either.\"\n\n\nRather than snapping at you, Rhode studies you quietly for a moment as if you’re a puzzle she’s trying to solve. \"Is that so?\" she asks eventually. \"And why exactly do you think that?\"\n\n\n\"Because you’re still here, Mistress,\" you tell her stubbornly. \"You can’t expect us to believe that every fight you won was just luck. There must’ve been times when your opponent had the upper hand and the crowd was against you and it would’ve been easier to give up, but you didn’t! You never knelt down and waited for your enemy to kill you. No matter how hard it was, you always got back up and you kept fighting. That’s why you’re still alive, Mistress. And I’m going to stay alive too.\"\n\n\nThe other students are deathly silent as they stare at you, waiting for Rhode’s reaction. \"You’re too smart for your own good, girl, has anybody ever told you that?\" she asks you calmly… Too calmly. Before you have time to react, Rhode reaches out to grab you by the throat and lifts you into the air, holding you so that your eyes are level with hers. \"You’re right, I didn’t just win because I was lucky,\" she tells you, as your hands grab at her arm, trying to pull yourself up, so she doesn’t choke the life out of you. \"But I didn’t just win because I was determined, either. I won because I was strong. Do you know why I was strong?\" she asks, but you’re too busy flailing your legs and gasping for air to answer. \"It’s because I didn’t just train because I had to! I didn’t train to avoid a beating and I sure as hell didn’t train to show off for anyone. I trained to stay alive! You want to stay alive, girl? You don’t just train. You don’t just train hard. You train until you’re stronger than every other person in this academy! Doesn’t matter if they’re five years older than you, doesn’t matter if they’re ten years older than you. Hell, it doesn’t matter if the only person left that can beat you is me! If there’s somebody in this academy that’s stronger than you, there’ll be somebody in the arena that’s stronger than you, and if there’s somebody in the arena that’s stronger than you, you’re dead! Do you understand?\"\n\n\nWith Rhode’s hand around your throat, you can only gasp helplessly in response. Luckily, she accepts this as a suitable answer. \"Good,\" she says, resuming her calm demeanour and dropping you to the ground. \"And that applies to the rest of you, too! Now everybody back to work!\"\n\n\nWhile the other students scatter to get back to their training, Alexius and Lula head over to help you. \"You are being brave and stupid,\" Lula says with a cheeky grin across her face as she takes your hand and pulls you to your feet. \"I am like it though. Mistress is do what she want and nobody is say nothing back. Now she know you fighter. Is good you tell her off. Maybe no do again though. Not want her for to kill you.\"\n\n\n\"I wish you hadn’t said anything,\" Alexius tells you. \"I was so scared when she started choking you like that… But I’m glad,\" he says, wrapping you in a brotherly hug. \"I’m glad you didn’t believe all that stuff she said about dying with honour. I’m glad you’re going to stay alive. I don’t ever want you to die, Venus. Not ever!\"\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Lula.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Alexius.\n","page 396":"The conversation is interrupted when Brasus returns without the water he was sent to fetch. \"Uh, Venus and Alexius, Mistress Rhode wants us to get back to training. I tried to tell her what happened, but she got mad. You should probably come quick, before we get into more trouble.\"\n\n\nKnowing better than to risk Rhode’s wrath, Alexius holds his hand against the injury on his head and goes straight back to the arena. You move to follow, but Caecilia reaches out and puts a hand on your shoulder to stop you. \"Wait,\" she says gently. \"I just wanted to ask… Papa told me that people are slaves because the Gods chose them to be. I don’t know if I believe it though,\" she confesses to you in a whisper, as if she’s afraid someone else will hear. \"Why are you a slave?\" she asks.\n\n\nWell, that’s a question with a whole lot of answers. The straight forward story is that your father sold you, but there are other people involved with how you became a slave. The merchant that sold you for one, and her own father for another. Then again, perhaps you don’t want to talk about it.\n","page 153":"The next few days of your life are like hell on earth. You survive on what little food you can catch, and while Lula insists that it’s only been a few days, you feel like you’ve been locked away in the darkness for an eternity. In the dim light that leaks through the cracks in the floor above, you witness things that you’d never even seen in your worst nightmares. A woman wakes you up wailing one night, and when the sailors come down, they find that her baby has died in her arms. Ignoring the woman, the men just pry the child out of her hands and take it on deck to throw overboard like a bad piece of meat. The woman continues to scream for hours until one of the other slaves knocks her unconscious just to get some rest. Nobody helps her. Nobody cares.\n\n\nOne morning, when Lula is listing the kinds of work you might be expected to do as a slave in Rome, the conversation is cut short when you hear a horrific, gasping sound of someone in horrible pain. You turn around to see that one of the biggest, strongest slaves has his chains wrapped around another man’s throat and is choking him to death. You shout out to object, but Lula quickly puts her hand over your mouth.\n\n\n\"No noise!\" she whispers to you. \"If you make big noise, sailors come and stop man before is finished.\" You stare blankly at her in confusion for a second, before she explains to you. \"The man is tell him to do it,\" she says, pointing to the slave that is being strangled, his eyes wide with terror. \"He is ask big man for to kill him. He know he do it quick. He die soon.\"\n\n\nShe’s right. Almost as soon as she’s finished talking, the man with the chains around his neck goes limp. The man who choked him gives the chains one last tug before rolling the dead body away and sitting back like nothing had happened. \"Why?\" you ask Lula, completely unable to fathom it.\n\n\nThe girl just shrugs like it doesn’t matter. \"He no want to live no more.\" This time last week you couldn’t possibly have understood that. Perhaps now you can.\n\n\nYou don’t know how much longer you can take it yourself. Every day you grow weaker, and Alexius is practically skin and bones. Throughout the day, you often pass out from the excruciating heat, and the stink is so unbearable that it’s made you physically sick on more than one occasion. Then there are the screams. Every night, a group of sailors will come down to the hull and choose a woman to take up with them on deck. Sometimes the women will go quietly, other times their screams will go on from the moment they are chosen till they’re brought back in tears a few hours later.\n\n\nOne night, when the sailors are dragging another girl on deck, you catch Lula glaring at them with pure hatred in her eyes. \"I kill all them before I let them do that to me,\" you hear her whisper under hear breath. You ask her what she means, but she just rolls over and tells you to go back to sleep.\n","page 274":"Rhode waits a moment for you to reply, but you stay silent. After a few seconds, Rhode’s temper seems to cool. \"Nothing to say?\" she asks again, this time far more calmly than before.\n\n\n\"Nothing, Mistress,\" you say quietly.\n\n\nRhode continues to look down on you for a little while. You thought that staying quiet would keep you out of trouble, but while Rhode doesn’t appear angry any more, she does seem quite disappointed. Perhaps she wanted you to say something after all. \"Anybody else got anything to say?\" she shouts out to the other students, some of which shake their heads and all of which keep their mouths shut. \"Then get back to work!\"\n\n\nWhile the other students scatter to get back to their training, you wonder if maybe you should have spoken up after all. It’s then that you catch Alexius looking up at you with a faint smile. \"Thanks for not saying anything,\" he whispers to you. \"I was really worried we were going to get into trouble.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Alexius.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Rhode.\n","page 255":"Luckily for you, the discussion is interrupted when you hear a wail of pain and turn to see that all the students in the practice yard are starting to gather in a circle. You and Rhode both head over to the crowd to see what\u0027s going on. From what you can see, looking over some of the smaller children\u0027s shoulders, it appears a simple training exercise turned extremely nasty. The young boy you saw training with the net earlier has been disarmed, and the older girl who was practising with javelins is looming over him, beating him senseless with a wooden sword. The other children clear a path as Rhode approaches, but she simply folds her arms and watches the fight, doing nothing to intervene.\n\n\n\"You’re pathetic, Brasus!\" the blonde girl screams, bringing the sword down across the boy’s back and causing him to cry out in pain once more.\n\n\n\"Gerda, please! Let me up, I didn’t do anything!\" the boy begs, but the girl ignores his pleas and hits him again.\n\n\n\"You think covering your head and crying will help you in the arena? You won’t last five minutes! They’re going to slice you to ribbons!\" Gerda mocks him as she beats her wooden sword against his right shoulder. \"There! You just lost an arm!\" While Brasus tries to edge away, she brings the sword down on his left shoulder. \"Your other arm!\" she then takes a step back and starts hitting the back of his knees. \"Both your legs!\" she shouts, cruelly smiling at the boy’s sobs as he cowers in a ball, making no move to defend himself. \"And now you’re dead,\" Gerda says, holding the sword up as high as she can reach, ready to bring it down over the boy’s head.\n\n\n\"Little bitch!\" you hear Lula scream as she tries to push her way past the other students. \"You leave boy alone and try hit me!\" she dares the girl. \"I rip you pretty hair out and use for to strangle you!\"\n\n\nYou should probably do something, but on the other side of the circle of students, you see Alexius watching you, shaking his head as if silently asking you not to get involved. He doesn’t want you getting into trouble.\n","page 376":"\"Wait here, I’ll be back soon,\" you tell the girl, before heading towards the infirmary.

It should stop soon,\" she says as she dabs his cut with her sleeve again. \"I’m Caecilia, by the way.

About a year ago now, wasn’t it?\"\n\n\n\"Nearly two years, Master,\" Rhode corrects him. \"The girl you bought with them took place in the battle today as well.\"\n\n\n\"I bought a girl with them?\" Titus asks with a laugh. \"Well, clearly your memory of that day is better than mine. Still, I distinctly remember seeing something in these that day. I knew you could make something out of them, and I knew I had to keep them together, just like I chose to keep them together in the battle today, and see how it paid off. You should really have more faith in my judgement, woman. Just as I have faith in your ability to mould these into battle-ready warriors. With my judgement and your training combined, we seldom go wrong, do we?\"\n\n\n\"If you say so, Master,\" Rhode replies, not nearly as cheerful about the battle’s result.\n\n\nTitus looks frustrated by Rhode’s lack of enthusiasm. \"I don’t know what you’re so miserable about. We won, didn’t we? The gold I made from this wager is enough to buy you ten new students. Good, strong ones too. More than enough to make up for what we lost in the arena. Besides, our losses were minimal. Practically nothing.\"\n\n\nWith that comment, Rhode doesn’t say a word, but turns to look Titus directly in the eye before delivering a sharp slap across his face. After a brief moment of silence, Titus fixes the woman with a chastising look. \"In front of the children, Rhode?\" he asks under his breath before quickly grabbing the wrist of the hand she used to slap him. For a second you think he is going to break it, but instead he merely holds her in place for a few seconds, staring into her eyes as she glares defiantly back. \"Lucky for you, I’m in a very good mood today, so I’ll let this one slide, just this once.

No!\" Lula grits her teeth in anger, clearly still wanting to claw Gerda’s eyes out, but you think you understand what Rhode is saying. \"This isn’t a game. Once you’re in the arena and the swords are real, do you think you can just run around the ring, fighting everyone yourself while the rest of your team cowers on the ground, waiting for you to save them?\" she asks, tilting her head to gesture towards Brasus, as Gerda finally tires of beating the boy and walks away, leaving him in tears. \"If that boy’s going to survive, he can’t depend on stronger children to rescue him every time someone gets the upper hand.

Brasus not hurt no more.\"\n\n\n\"I hate you!\" Alexius screams at you before storming off towards the gates, waiting for them to open so that he can get away from all of this.\n\n\nSo, Alexius is angry at you for killing his friend, but Lula thinks you did the right thing.

He thinks he can just throw half starved runts at me and expects me to carve you into some kind of shining, marble demi-gods. And you know what the worst part is? I actually try. Gods know I try so hard to keep you all alive, and look at you! You’re in the arena for less than ten minutes and you’re so exhausted, you can barely stand,\" she scolds you, rubbing her thumb and forefinger against her tattooed brow in frustration. \"You need to do better than this,\" Rhode tells you stressfully. \"Call me unfair, call me cruel, call me a fucking bitch, I don’t give a shit. The bottom line is that if you don’t take your training seriously, you’re both going to die. Do you understand?\"\n\n\n\"Yes Mistress,\" you and Alexius say in unison.

Let go now!\"\n\n\n\"Stay out of it!\" you tell her firmly. \"It’s got nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\nThe girl, Gerda, looks back at you and gives a cruel smile before using all her strength to bring the wooden sword down. She hits Brasus so hard the sword snaps and splinters, leaving a great gash down the boy’s forehead. Brasus gives a horrific wail of pain, but Gerda only laughs at him, dropping the broken sword and walking away.\n\n\nLula cries out in anger, and tries to break free of your grip to get to Gerda, shouting a variety of words in her own language, which you assume are all curse words and insults. The boy, Brasus, is crying on the ground, looking up at you as if all of this was your fault.\n\n\nSuddenly, the crowd of children parts as Rhode walks over, pushing you away from Lula before roughly smacking her across the back of the head. \"Stupid girl!\" your tutor snaps. \"You think fighting other people’s battles is going to help them?\" she asks, grabbing Lula roughly by the shoulders. \"Look at me, girl!\" she orders. \"This isn’t a game! Once you’re in the arena and the swords are real, do you think you can just run around the ring, fighting everyone yourself while the rest of your team cowers on the ground, waiting for you to save them?\" she asks, tilting Lula’s head and forcing her to look at Brasus. \"If that boy’s going to survive, he can’t depend on stronger children to rescue him every time someone gets the upper hand. In the end, if he can’t do it himself, he’ll die. It’s that simple.\" With that, Rhode lets Lula go and walks away.

I’m just stuck here until that happens.\"\n\n\n\"Oh…\" Caecilia mumbles, not sure what to make of your unique opinion. \"So, you weren’t always slaves?\" she asks timidly. \"The lady who dresses me and brushes my hair is a slave, but she says she was born like that.

You want that sailors come and beat you with whip for make too much noise? No more cry! Be man now. No cry.\"\n\n\nAlexius is still sobbing, but after being warned about getting beaten with a whip, he at least tries to calm himself down, his tears going from hysterical wailing to sobs controlled by deep breaths. \"I c-can’t help it!\" he whimpers, his crying gradually getting quieter.\n\n\n\"You try, eh?\" the girl asks sweetly. \"You try to stop the cry, yes? Good boy.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with the girl.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Alexius.\n\n\nAs your brother starts to settle, the girl’s voice gets softer, not seeming so bossy any more. \"What you names?\" she asks quietly.\n\n\nAlexius seems to have calmed down now and answers her, after sniffing and rubbing his eyes. \"I’m Alexius,\" he tells the girl. \"This is my sister, Venus.\"\n\n\n\"I am being Lula,\" she introduces herself. \"I am come from long, long way, across big sea. Living in small village with family. But then there is come many men, all pale like you. They make much kill and burn and then take us away for to sell. Is how I am being slave.\" You’re not quite sure why the girl is telling you all this. Maybe she naturally talks too much, or perhaps she’s just extremely lonely. Either way, she seems to be genuinely trying to make friends. \"How many years you have?\"\n\n\nAlexius doesn’t seem to understand the question, so you answer for him. \"I’m ten. Alexius is seven.\"\n\n\n\"Nearly eight,\" he objects, as if that makes him any more mature.\n\n\n\"I am have nine years,\" Lula tells you, happily. \"We nearly the same.\"\n\n\nPerhaps in more ways than one. Her circumstances might’ve been different from yours, but the girl understands what it’s like to have her life snatched away from her. Both literally and figuratively, you’re all in the same boat. Maybe you and Alexius could use a friend for the long journey you have ahead of you, if not for the company, then at least to help you survive.\n","page 262":"You let out a sigh and turn to the ground, ignoring the fight and deciding it’s none of your business. Gerda is about to bring down her sword on the boy’s head, when Lula grabs her by the hair and pulls her back, throwing the older girl down to the ground. \"Come on!\" Lula yells. \"You think you strong? Get up! Come fight me!\"\n\n\nGerda gets back to her feet and is about to take Lula up on her challenge, when your trainer, Rhode, stands between them, causing all the children to fall silent. With a cold frown, Rhode slaps Lula roughly across the face before turning to Gerda. \"Get back to it,\" she tells the girl, who looks confused for a moment before Rhode lifts a hand to point to Brasus. \"Go on, girl, hit him!\"\n\n\nA malicious smile twists Gerda’s lips as she heads back to the younger boy and starts mercilessly beating him with the sword, even harder than she was before. The whole time, the boy just cries out in pain, shielding his head with his arms and waiting for it to be over.\n\n\n\"Look!\" Rhode orders, grabbing Lula by the hair and holding her head up, forcing her to watch. \"You see that?\" she hisses in her ear. \"You just put yourself in harm’s way to save that boy from a beating, and did it help him? No!\" Lula grits her teeth in anger, clearly still wanting to claw Gerda’s eyes out, but you think you understand what Rhode is saying. \"This isn’t a game. Once you’re in the arena and the swords are real, do you think you can just run around the ring, fighting everyone yourself while the rest of your team just cowers on the ground, waiting for you to save them?\" she asks, tilting her head to gesture towards Brasus as Gerda finally tires of beating the boy, and walks away, leaving him in tears. \"If that boy’s going to survive, he can’t depend on stronger children to rescue him every time someone gets the upper hand. In the end, if he can’t do it himself, he’ll die. It’s that simple.\" With that, Rhode lets Lula go and walks away.\n\n\nWith the scene over and done with, the other children start to grow bored and get back to training. All except Lula. Completely ignoring what Rhode said about Brasus needing to look after himself, Lula holds out her hand and helps the boy to his feet.\n","page 140":"\"Men do cry sometimes,\" you tell the girl. \"My father cried all the time when he was drunk and lost all his money. It kept us up at night.\" For a second, you wonder if your father is crying now, regretting what he did and wishing he could bring you back. You then decide that it doesn’t matter. Your father isn’t part of your life any more.\n\n\n\"Really?\" the girl asks, surprised. \"You father cry when you hear? My father, no. My father tell me only babies make cry.\" Despite what she’s saying, the girl doesn’t seem to be trying to insult you. In fact, she genuinely seems interested in getting to know you both better. \"What you names?\" she asks quietly.\n\n\nAlexius seems to have calmed down now and answers her, after sniffing and rubbing his eyes. \"I’m Alexius,\" he tells the girl. \"This is my sister, Venus.\"\n\n\n\"I am being Lula,\" she introduces herself. \"I am come from long, long way, across big sea.

A few of the other children turn to stare at you, but you ignore them. \"What’s wrong with you, boy? You’re just going to lie there and let her beat you into the ground? Get up! Fight back!\"\n\n\nLula has stopped her angry rampage now and is staring at you, wondering if there’s any logic in your approach and waiting to see what happens. Gerda brings the wooden sword down hard and Brasus only just manages to raise his arm in time to stop the sword snapping over his head. He shouts out in pain and holds his arm, trying to back away from his attacker. \"Come on!\" you shout out, irritably. \"You can’t just let her get away with that! Get the sword! Hit her back!\"\n\n\n\"Shut up!\" Gerda screams, turning around and lifting her sword as she starts to advance on you. The other students get out of her way to avoid getting hit, but before the girl gets close enough to attack you, Brasus lets out a cry of anger and jumps on Gerda’s back, knocking her to the ground.\n\n\nAt that point, the rest of the children start cheering and gather in close to watch as Brasus gets his revenge, pummelling Gerda with punches that you can’t imagine hurt too much, considering the boy’s small stature, but are enough to keep the girl pinned down long enough to humiliate her in front of everyone.\n\n\nYou catch Alexius looking at you with a bright smile on his face. He knows that Brasus wouldn’t have stuck up for himself if you hadn’t cheered him on, and he looks proud of you.\n\n\nSuddenly, the crowd parts as your trainer, Rhode, approaches the group. Brasus quickly gets to his feet, and Gerda walks over to Rhode, spitting out a mouthful of blood and looking furious. \"Look what that little brat did to me!\" she screams, but is quickly silenced when Rhode gives her a sharp slap across her face.\n\n\n\"Yes, look what he did to you!\" Rhode snaps. \"The boy’s five years younger than you, and you let him get the upper hand! If you’re not strong enough to defend yourself from a little boy, then you deserve worse than a split lip! Now get back to training!\" she orders her, before looking around at the rest of the children that have gathered to watch the show. \"All of you!\"\n\n\nThe rest of the children quickly scatter, and you are about to walk away yourself when Rhode puts a firm hand on your shoulder, keeping you still. For a moment, you think that she’s about to punish you for getting involved, but when you look up, you see an amused smile on her lips. \"I never thought that Brasus would work up the nerve to stick up to her,\" she says quietly, so only you can hear. \"He’s a pathetic boy. Titus bought him on an impulse, because he had a pretty face, like you. Your Master doesn’t seem to understand that a living, ugly slave is worth more than a dead, pretty one. Still, you got Brasus to fight back. I don’t know how you managed it, but keep it up. Maybe we’ll get that boy to survive his first match after all.\" With that, Rhode walks away, leaving you to get back to your training.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Brasus.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Alexius.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Gerda.\n","page 382":"There is silence for a moment before your brother speaks up. \"Yes, ma’am,\" he admits, sounding quite ashamed. \"We didn’t use to be, but… Well… Now we are.\"\n\n\nCaecilia seems a little saddened by this. \"So, you weren’t always slaves?\" she asks timidly. \"The lady who dresses me and brushes my hair is a slave, but she says she was born like that. I mean, I know not everybody who’s a slave starts out that way. but…\"\n","page 143":"Lula continues to make conversation with you for awhile. Mostly she talks about her life back in Africa, but her small talk seems to have a positive effect on Alexius, since it distracts him from thinking about his own life in Greece. It’s only in the moments of silence that Alexius starts sobbing again, telling you he wants to go home, back to Papa. Whenever he starts though, Lula will shuffle closer to you both and reach her hand out to stroke your brother’s hair, singing a gentle tune in a strange language from her own country. You don’t understand what it means, but it calms Alexius down anyway.\n\n\nIt’s in the middle of one of Lula’s songs that the door to the deck flies open and you see two sailors standing outside, holding large baskets of bread. At this moment, all the slaves start calling together in their various languages, getting to their feet and holding their hands out towards the door. Lula jumps to her feet with the rest of them and starts begging for food in her own language, leaving you and Alexius alone on the ground, looking lost and confused.\n\n\nFeeding time seems to have an every man for himself policy, as the sailors start throwing rolls of bread across the hull. The slaves start grabbing it out of the air, ripping it from each other’s hands, shoving as much as they can in their mouths before someone else tries to take it off them. Still, by whatever small measure of luck you still happen to possess, one of the rolls falls directly into your lap.\n\n\nYou hug it tightly against your chest, having only a few seconds to decide what to do with it before a bigger, stronger slave tries to take it away from you. As the oldest, it could be considered your responsibility to provide for your little brother, or you could try and use the bread to strengthen your friendship with Lula. Then again, you haven’t eaten since yesterday, and you don’t know when you’ll get the chance to eat again. Maybe you should just eat the bread to keep your own strength up.\n","page 264":"\"Okay, gather ‘round!\" Rhode calls out to the students, all of which stop whatever it is they’re doing to listen to her. \"For those of you that are new, there are some important lessons you need to learn. For those of you that have been here awhile, it seems some of you are forgetting what I’ve been teaching you from the start. Pay attention, because if I have to repeat this again, there will be consequences! Now, can somebody tell me, what is the most important part of a gladiator’s life?\"\n\n\nSilence falls across the practice yard. By the way the students are looking at each other, you can tell they all know the answer, they just don’t want to give it. Eventually, Gerda steps forward and shouts her answer out clearly, so that everyone can hear. \"Their death, Mistress!\"\n\n\n\"Exactly,\" Rhode replies. \"Some of you might think you can avoid death. I am telling you now that every one of you here is going to die. Whether it’s in the arena, or in your beds when you’re a hundred years old, you’re all going to die. As gladiators though, most of you will not live to see thirty years. For some of you, that means half your lives have already past. I’d say it’s about time you start thinking about how you want to die.\n\n\nYes, there is honour in victory. Yes, you should always try as hard as you can to achieve this victory, but no matter how strong you are, most of you will die in battle. The most important thing I can teach you is to prepare yourself for an honourable death.\n\n\nA true gladiator accepts death with dignity. You will not flinch or cry out or beg for mercy. If and when you are defeated in battle, you will kneel willingly before your opponent and lift your head to them, exposing your neck so that they may end your life with a swift stab to your throat.\n\n\nTo fight takes courage, but to die well is the most courageous act a man can ever accomplish! You will redeem yourself from the humiliation of defeat, you will receive an honourable burial and, most importantly, both the crowd and your opponent will respect you. Your lives are fleeting, but your death will remain the same for the rest of eternity. There is nothing more important than the way you die.\"\n\n\nAlexius is beside you, and after your mistress has finished her speech, your little brother looks up at you and gives a faint shake of his head. He doesn’t agree with Rhode and he doesn’t want you to either.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Rhode must’ve noticed your brother’s small gesture of defiance, because she pushes her way through the rest of the students and grabs Alexius’s chin in her hand, forcing him to look up to her. \"Do you have a problem with something I just said, boy?\" Rhode asks, glaring into his eyes.\n\n\n\"No, Mistress!\" Alexius shouts, clearly terrified of the woman and too frightened to say what he really thinks.\n\n\n\"And you?\" she asks, turning her venomous gaze your way. \"I’ve been fighting in the arena longer than you’ve been alive, but if you think you know better than me, please share your thoughts with the rest of the class. I’m sure we’ll all be enlightened by whatever you have to teach us.\"\n\n\nWell, that’s just not fair! Alexius was the one who disagreed with her, but for some reason, you’re the one that’s in trouble. Still, everybody is staring at you now. You’re going to have to say something.\n","page 385":"\"No,\" you tell Caecilia.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" your brother says at the exact same time, causing the girl to look very confused.\n\n\n\"Just because your father paid a man a few sesterces for us doesn’t mean we’re slaves,\" you tell her defiantly. \"I was free before all of this, and I’m going to be free again.

I can’t spend the rest of my life watching my friends die, and killing people like it doesn’t matter, I can’t!\"\n\n\n\"You can,\" you tell him. \"You have to. What else are you going to do? Give up? Throw your sword down and just let someone kill you? You can fight, Alexius, you did it today. You’ll do it again. You’re a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for, so don’t talk about giving up like that. Just focus on staying alive.\"\n\n\nYour brother wipes the tears away from his eyes and nods his head. \"I’ll try,\" he promises you, staring blankly out of the window for a moment before speaking up again. \"I miss Mama,\" Alexius whimpers. \"I think about her every day. Papa too, even after what he did to us. I think about Greece and our friends and our home. I think I miss you most of all.\"\n\n\nYou laugh a little at that. \"Me? How can you miss me? I’m right here with you.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, but you’re not,\" Alexius objects. \"I mean, you’re here, but you’re not the same. I love you, Unknown, but sometimes it’s like you’re not my any more.\"\n\n\nYou think you understand now. Perhaps you hadn’t realised how much you and your brother have grown apart since you came here, and even if you tried, you don’t know if you’ll ever be able to get that bond back. You’ve both changed since you came to the academy, and you know that you’re only going to change more with time. After all, a life time of battle and death are going to have an effect on you. Can you live through that without losing your soul? Can Alexius? Can anyone? Only time will tell.\n","page 289":"You sneak out of the practice yard and explore the academy. There are a few guards scattered about, but you manage to make your way around without being seen. Unfortunately, you don’t get very far with your escape plan. With the wall around the building being so high, the only way in or out seems to be the gate, and with that being guarded, escape seems pretty much impossible. You head back to the practice yard, hoping that some day the opportunity to escape might present itself.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 Stealth.\n\n\nThe day is long and draining, and by the end, you’re relieved to hear the gong chime to signal that it’s time to rest. You head to the girl’s dormitories and lay in the bed that’s assigned to you. Once all the other girls are in bed, you hear the guard slide a bolt in the door that locks you inside. Well, that makes sense. In an academy full of slaves, of course they’d take precautions to stop you all escaping. It’s more than that to you though. With that single bolt on the door, any hopes you might have had of ever getting away from this place seem to vanish into the air around you and leave you feeling completely hopeless.\n","page 1147":"After what seems like the longest day of your life, Rhode takes a small measure of mercy on you in allowing you to skip evening training and catch your breath. Your mind is completely restless though. Training was one thing, but today you’ve had your first taste of what the rest of your life will be like, and it gives you much to think about.\n\n\n\"It’s not fair,\" Alexius says weakly as he sits himself down beside you. He has been very quiet all day, and only now decided to divulge his thoughts to you. It’s then that you notice that your brother is crying. \"Brasus was my friend. He was good. He wasn’t strong or fast or smart, but he was a good person. He shouldn’t have died like that, it’s not fair!\"\n\n\n\"No, it’s not,\" you agree. There’s not much else you can say to that. Nothing is fair any more.\n\n\n\"I can’t do this, Unknown!\" Alexius confesses. \"I can’t live like this. I can’t spend the rest of my life watching my friends die, and killing people like it doesn’t matter, I can’t!\"\n\n\n\"Then don’t,\" you tell him, gently putting a hand on your brother’s shoulder. \"Don’t kill people like it doesn’t matter, or like you don’t care. Fight because you have to. Fight because I need you. You don’t have to turn into a monster, Alexius, but remember what Master Titus said. He wants us to train as a team, so we’ll be fighting in the arena together. I know you don’t want to hurt anybody, but we have to look after each other. I’m going to do everything I can to keep you safe, but I can’t do that on my own. Please promise you’ll fight to stay alive, Alexius, because if I lost you... I don’t know what I’d do.\"\n\n\nYour brother wipes the tears away from his eyes and nods his head. \"I’ll try,\" he promises you, resting his head on your shoulder like he used to when you were small. \"I miss Mama,\" Alexius whimpers. \"I think about her every day. Papa too, even after what he did to us. I think about Greece and our friends and our home. I remember when we did our fighting with sticks, and it was all just a game. But that’s all gone now. We’re never going to get it back, are we?\"\n\n\nYou are quiet for a moment and shake your head. You’ll never get any of it back. Even if by some miracle you both make it out of this academy alive, your lives will never even be a shadow of what they were before.\n\n\n\"I’m glad I still have you,\" Alexius says. \"I don’t think I could keep going if I didn’t have you, Unknown. You’re all I’ve got left now,\" he tells you sadly. \"Promise you’ll never stop being my .\"\n\n\nYou laugh a little at that. \"What in the underworld are you talking about? Of course I’ll always be your . I can’t exactly stop being your , can I?\" you tell him.\n\n\n\"I don’t mean that!\" Alexius objects. \"Just promise me you’ll always be... You know... You.\"\n\n\nYou think you understand now. There’s more than one way you can lose someone. You can do everything in your power to stay alive, but will it matter if you’ve changed beyond any recognition of who you were before? You want to promise you’ll stay the same person, but it’s a promise you know you can’t keep. After all, a life time of battle and death are going to have an effect on you. Can you live through that without losing your soul? Can Alexius? Can anyone? Only time will tell.\n","page 1025":"Now the battle is over, you no longer have the gladius to boost your strength.

In the end though, he dismisses the thought with a wave of his hand. \"I should really be teaching you some tricks about fighting myself, but I’m afraid I’ve grown lazy and content in my old age. Too much wine and women will do that to a man. Still, I doubt there’s anything you can learn from me that Rhode can’t teach you better. That bitch will make your lives a bloody misery, but she’ll make you stronger than anything the arena can throw at you.

I might be past my prime, but I should at least be able to pass my skills on to another generation. Be sure to rise extra early in the morning, you two. Taurus Torvus is going to turn you into champions.\"\n","page 1022":"Back in the gladiator’s cage, your armour is removed and your wounds are dressed. Outside you can hear the crowd conversing amongst themselves as they leave. It seems strange to you that after all the violence and blood and death of the past few minutes, the rest of the world just goes on as normal.\n\n\nJust as one of the healers finishes wrapping your last injury in bandages, you notice two other healers carrying Brasus’s lifeless body in on a stretcher.\n","page 1142":"Rubbing his cheek where Rhode slapped him, Titus turns to you and your brother and shrugs the insult away. \"Women,\" he says with a grin. \"They can go from placid calm to vengeful rage in the space of a second, and you’ll never see it coming. But that’s my own failing I suppose, always too soft on women. a woman ever tries to give you any back talk, just knock a few of her teeth out until she learns to hold her tongue. If you give them an inch, they’ll take a mile and you’ll spend the rest of your life regretting it. But enough of that, I’m in too high spirits to be disheartened. We’re celebrating your first victory, after all. Watching you both down there today, it took me back to my own first battle, nearly... By the Gods, it must be more than thirty years ago now.\"\n\n\n\"You fought in the arena?\" you ask, completely taken aback by the thought. You had always assumed your master was born into wealth. With all the luxury and servants that constantly surround him, you find it hard to picture the man as a gladiator.\n\n\nTitus, in turn, seems surprised by your reaction. \"You didn’t know?\" he asks with a laugh. \"I’m shocked. Back when I first put Rhode in charge of this academy, she never stopped singing my praises to the students, always rambling on about my victories to try to impress and motivate them, though perhaps that was all for my benefit and she didn’t see fit to mention me once my back was turned.\"\n\n\nIt’s then that the truth finally hits you both, and you do not even have time to respond before Alexius blurts out, \"You’re the warrior cow!\"\n\n\nLuckily, Titus takes this in good humour, with a bellowing laugh. \"Warrior cow? Now that’s one I’ve never heard before. Still, cow, bull, Taurus Torvus, I suppose it all means the same. A mindless beast with more rage then sense. A title I fear was more accurate than I’d wish to admit, at the time. I was headstrong and overconfident, and I have my fair share of scars to show for it.\"\n\n\n\"Mistress Rhode said you killed a lion with your bare hands when you were ten years old!\" Alexius declares with childish excitement.\n\n\nTitus merely rolls his eyes at this suggestion. \"Is that what she’s telling you? Bloody woman’s filling your heads with children’s stories, I was fifteen at least, I had a wooden sword and the lion was old and half dead to begin with. It wasn’t exactly a fair fight, I grant you. We were just meat for the beasts. I think ten of us were thrown into the pit, and only Rhode and myself made it out alive. I was lucky enough to have broken my sword earlier in the fight, and the splintered wood made for a perfect dagger. While it was gnawing on one of the other children, I jabbed the sword into the beast’s throat and the crowd cheered so loudly for me, they declared us victorious and stopped the fight before they’d even released the tigers. Not nearly as glamorous as Rhode’s version, I fear, but the truth seldom lives up to the legend.\n\n\nBut we have strayed from the point,\" Titus continues. \"I brought you here to speak of you. More specifically, your future. You two fought well today. You held your own and brought your team-mates together to fight as a group. One thing I noticed that surprised me though, is that you did not fight together. I thought I’d made it clear to Rhode that I purchased you to fight as a pair. I pictured you as in arms, as well as in blood. Like Romulus and Remus, the warrior brothers who founded the very city of Rome. Still, you two were separate throughout most of the battle. Has Rhode been training you to fight together?\"\n\n\n\"No sir, not often,\" you reply. \"Mistress says we are not on the same level. I mostly train with the older .\"\n\n\n\"Bloody useless woman,\" Titus mutters, rubbing his temples in frustration. \"No matter. We have plenty of time to fix that. You must have, what? Two years between you at most? That may seem like a large difference now, but in five years it will be nothing. From now on, I want you two to be joined at the hip from sunrise to sunset. Study each other, learn each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and shape them to your mutual advantage. Alone you can both become great warriors, but together you will be something far more important. You will be recognised. And believe me, , when you are a gladiator, there is nothing more important than having a crowd that knows your name.\"\n","page 290":"You decide to skip training. With Rhode gone, there isn’t anybody around to punish you. For a few hours, you are largely ignored by the other students and starting to get very bored. Eventually, Lula puts the blunted javelin she was training with to one side and approaches you.\n\n\n\"What you doing?\" Lula asks. \"Why you do no train? Is stupid for not to train, Venus. If no train, you no get strong. If no get strong, how you fight? How you look after you brother if you no strong?\"\n\n\nBefore you can answer, you hear a gong chime to signify that it’s the end of the day and time to rest. Lula walks away, leaving you to contemplate what she said. You head to the girl’s dormitories and lay in the bed that’s assigned to you. Once all the other girls are in bed, you hear the guard slide a bolt in the door that locks you inside. Well, that makes sense.

Stupid, mean ” she snaps at you before walking angrily away.\n\n\nYou have lost 15 approval with Lula.\n","page 293":"\"You sleep?\" you hear Lula’s voice whisper an hour or two later.\n\n\n\"No,\" you reply. You can’t sleep at all. You suppose it’s just as well, since Lula would’ve probably woken you up anyway.\n\n\nThe girl gets up and walks over to sit down at the foot of your bed. \"Is bad, yes?\" she asks you. \"Be slave always bad, but I am not think this happen. No think we being people who fight.\" Breathing a heavy sigh, the girl is silent for a moment, looking down on you. \"You quiet,\" she remarks. \"What you thinking?\"\n","page 1140":"\"Ah, there you are,\" Titus greets you both with a broad grin on his face. \"My Greek legends. How far you’ve both come from the scrawny little scraps of skin and bone I bought at the docks. You know, I still remember that day I bought you. When was it Rhode? About a year ago now, wasn’t it?\"\n\n\n\"Nearly two years, Master,\" Rhode corrects him. \"The girl you bought with them took place in the battle today as well.\"\n\n\n\"I bought a girl with them?\" Titus asks with a laugh. \"Well, clearly your memory of that day is better than mine. Still, I distinctly remember seeing something in these that day. I knew you could make something out of them, and I knew I had to keep them together, just like I chose to keep them together in the battle today, and see how it paid off. You should really have more faith in my judgement, woman. Just as I have faith in your ability to mould these into battle-ready warriors. With my judgement and your training combined, we seldom go wrong, do we?\"\n\n\n\"If you say so, Master,\" Rhode replies, not nearly as cheerful about the battle’s result.\n\n\nTitus looks frustrated by Rhode’s lack of enthusiasm. \"I don’t know what you’re so miserable about. We won, didn’t we? The gold I made from this wager is enough to buy you ten new students. Good, strong ones too. More than enough to make up for what we lost in the arena. Besides, our losses were minimal. Practically nothing.\"\n\n\nWith that comment, Rhode doesn’t say a word, but turns to look Titus directly in the eye before delivering a sharp slap across his face. After a brief moment of silence, Titus fixes the woman with a chastising look. \"In front of the children, Rhode?\" he asks under his breath before quickly grabbing the wrist of the hand she used to slap him. For a second you think he is going to break it, but instead he merely holds her in place for a few seconds, staring into her eyes as she glares defiantly back. \"Lucky for you, I’m in a very good mood today, so I’ll let this one slide, just this once. Now get out of here before I reconsider.\"\n\n\nRhode doesn’t need to be told twice, and as soon as Titus loosens his grip on her hand, she descends the stairs, leaving you and Alexius alone with your master.\n","page 171":"You’ve been at sea for about twelve days when the sailors come down and start herding all the slaves onto the deck.

Sometimes the women will go quietly, other times their screams will go on from the moment they are chosen till they’re brought back in tears a few hours later.\n\n\nOne night, when the sailors are dragging another girl on deck, you catch Lula glaring at them with pure hatred in her eyes. \"I kill all them before I let them do that to me,\" you hear her whisper under hear breath. You ask her what she means, but she just rolls over and tells you to go back to sleep.\n","page 1037":"Back in the gladiator’s cage, your armour is removed and your wounds are dressed.

As they drag you away, Alexius reaches after you, calling your name and demanding to know what’s happening and why they are taking you. You don’t have an answer for him and remain silent as you are dragged out on deck.\n\n\nThe light of the sun almost blinds you after spending so long in the dark, and you’re so weak from lack of food that you collapse onto the hard, wooden deck the instant the sailor lets go of your arm. \"Bit of a scrawny runt, this one,\" one of them grumbles before pulling you back upright and thrusting a roll of bread in your hands. You’re practically starving right now, and waste no time in stuffing your face.\n\n\n\"All right, girl, eat your fill and quick about it, you’ve got work to do,\" the other sailor tells you. \"The ship’s boy went and snapped his neck falling out the crow’s nest, and we need somebody to do his job until we can get him replaced. That’d be you.\"\n\n\nAs you finish your last mouthful, you look between the two sailors as it’s explained that you’ll be taking on the role of cabin girl until you get to Rome. \"Me? But… I’ve never been on a ship before,\" you tell them nervously. \"I don’t know what to do.\"\n\n\nThe two sailors look at each other and one gives an unconcerned shrug. \"Guess you could start by cleaning this bloody mess,\" he says, gesturing to a dark stain on the deck, near the main mast. \"Still a nasty mark over there, where the ship’s boy got himself killed. Or you could see if anything else needs doing, I suppose. The doctor and the carpenter have their hands full at the minute, you could go help one of them.\"\n\n\n\"Or you could make yourself really useful and get us something to eat. I’m bloody starving,\" says the other sailor. \"And some water, while you’re at it.\"\n\n\nIt seems these men don’t know what you’re supposed to be doing any better than you do, which makes your task trickier. Still, you suppose it’s better to be up here where you can eat and stretch your legs than back in the hull, wasting away.

He wasn’t strong or fast or smart, but he was a good person. He shouldn’t have died like that, it’s not fair!\"\n\n\n\"Life’s not fair,\" you tell him flatly. \"I thought you’d have figured that out by now.\"\n\n\n\"I can’t do this, Unknown!\" Alexius confesses. \"I can’t live like this.

You’re supposed to be my , but you’re not. Before we came here we were a family and now... I don’t know what happened to you.\"\n\n\n\"I grew up,\" you tell him firmly. \"What the hell did you think? That we could just stay children forever? The world around us changed, so I changed with it. If you can’t do the same, then stay out of my way.\"\n\n\nAlexius doesn’t respond to this, and you know why. He’s still clinging on to the past, to the boy he used to be. For the first time in a long time, you look back on your younger self. It wasn’t so long ago, was it? When you were just a care free, mischievous who loved mother and respected father. Is there anything left of that any more? You’ve changed so much since you came to the academy, and you know that you’re only going to change more with time.

Papa too, even after what he did to us. I think about Greece and our friends and our home. I think I miss you most of all.\"\n\n\nYou laugh a little at that. \"Me? How can you miss me?

The sailors don’t seem very concerned with the cleanliness of the slaves, which is probably why so many of them get ill.\n\n\nThe work is easy enough at first, but after awhile your arms start to ache. You have to admire any ship boy’s stamina to keep the work up for so long and once the deck is cleaned, you’re told to scrub the kitchen as well. By the end of the day you’re exhausted, but at least you get to eat with the rest of the crew before you’re returned to the hull to sleep. Alexius is worried that you might get hurt, like the cabin boy before you, but Lula just seems jealous that you got a decent meal out of it.\n\n\nThe rest of the journey continues with you sleeping in chains all night and working hard all day. Your body aches from head to toe, but with all the work you’re doing and the extra food you’re given, you’re a lot stronger and healthier than you would’ve been if you’d remained chained up in the hull every day.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 Strength.\n","page 1030":"Now the battle is over, you no longer have the gladius to boost your strength.

Fight because you have to. Fight because I need you. You don’t have to turn into a monster, Alexius, but remember what Master Titus said. He wants us to train as a team, so we’ll be fighting in the arena together. I know you don’t want to hurt anybody, but we have to look after each other. I’m going to do everything I can to keep you safe, but I can’t do that on my own. Please promise you’ll fight to stay alive, Alexius, because if I lost you... I don’t know what I’d do.\"\n\n\nYour brother wipes the tears away from his eyes and nods his head. \"I’ll try,\" he promises you, resting his head on your shoulder like he used to when you were small. \"I miss Mama,\" Alexius whimpers. \"I think about her every day. Papa too, even after what he did to us. I think about Greece and our friends and our home. I remember when we did our fighting with sticks, and it was all just a game. But that’s all gone now. We’re never going to get it back, are we?\"\n\n\nYou are quiet for a moment and shake your head. You’ll never get any of it back. Even if by some miracle you both make it out of this academy alive, your lives will never even be a shadow of what they were before.\n\n\n\"I’m glad I still have you,\" Alexius says. \"I don’t think I could keep going if I didn’t have you, Unknown. You’re all I’ve got left now,\" he tells you sadly. \"Promise you’ll never stop being my .\"\n\n\nYou laugh a little at that. \"What in the underworld are you talking about? Of course I’ll always be your . I can’t exactly stop being your , can I?\" you tell him.\n\n\n\"I don’t mean that!\" Alexius objects. \"Just promise me you’ll always be... You know... You.\"\n\n\nYou think you understand now. There’s more than one way you can lose someone. You can do everything in your power to stay alive, but will it matter if you’ve changed beyond any recognition of who you were before? You want to promise you’ll stay the same person, but it’s a promise you know you can’t keep. After all, a life time of battle and death are going to have an effect on you.

Sometimes you’ll get asked to do other tasks, but generally you just try to stay out of everybody’s way and act busy whenever you catch someone looking at you.

Let every one of you know, that while you are in my possession, no act of rebellion will be tolerated!\" Gesturing to the Thracian slave in front of him, the Captain dramatically raises his voice. \"So that all of you will know the fate of a slave who does not obey his master!

You’re still linked to the rest of the slaves, but that doesn’t stop you. Pulling against your bonds with all your strength, you try to move forward, pulling the other slaves with you bit by bit. Lula and Alexius, who are chained up on either side of you, are tugged forward, but the others barely even feel it.

Then the anchor is dropped. All you can do is stand there, stunned, hearing the man’s last horrific scream before the anchor hits the water. Then nothing. The man is still down there, still alive, slowly sinking to the bottom of the harbour, suffocating to death. You drop to your knees in defeat. The Captain walks away from you, looking smug. To the other slaves, it looks like he only needed one whip lash to shut you up, but that had nothing to do with it. Once the anchor was dropped, there was no point in fighting any more.\n\n\nThings go calm on the ship, and you find yourself wondering the exact moment when the Thracian slave will run out of air and drown. You’re distracted from this depressing thought when Alexius gently wraps his arms around you and Lula leans down, using the corner of her skirt to wipe the trail of blood from the whip lash off your cheek. \"Why you do that?\" she whispers to you, softly. \"Stupid thing for to do.

And to make someone like that, you need to start with this!\" Titus tells her, pointing directly at you.\n","page 761":"Despite your better judgement, you know that killing this little girl just isn’t something you’re capable of. You pull your sword back, away from the girl’s throat. She continues to stare at you for a few seconds, still looking terrified as a mouse with a snake in its den.\n\n\nIn the end, you kick sand at the girl to shoo her away. \"Go on, go!\" you shout at her and she wastes no time in obeying, running as fast as she can to put as much distance between herself and you as possible. Letting the girl go was a valiant display of mercy, and hopefully she’ll return the favour by staying out of your way for the rest of the fight.\n\n\nNow that you have a weapon though, you need to figure out where best to use it. You take a second to survey your surroundings before deciding what your next move will be.\n","page 760":"Just because the girl looks harmless doesn’t mean she won’t kill you or any one of your team mates if she gets the chance. Without hesitating, you quickly slash your blade across the young girl’s throat, and are sprayed with crimson as the blood pours out from her neck. She is dead within seconds, collapsing to the ground in a pool of her own blood, a look of sheer terror frozen forever in the child’s innocent eyes.\n\n\nThis is the first time that you’ve ever killed anyone. How do you feel?\n","page 881":"Right on cue, you hear a helpless cry coming from behind you and your team all turn around at the same time. It seems you have found Brasus, along with the oldest and strongest of your opponents. This enemy is not an older, stronger child however, this is a man.

You do not understand why your master allowed Cato to include him in the fight.\n\n\nRight now, the man is holding Brasus in place with a tight grip of his hair in one hand, and with the other hand, he is holding a spatha, a kind of long broadsword, which he is pointing at the young boy’s throat. \"Please!\" Brasus cries out in a weak, helpless little voice. \"Don’t kill me! I won’t...\" His sentence ends with a gargle as the blade pierces his neck and blood spills out from his throat. Then the man lets go of his hair and he drops Brasus to the ground, the boy still coughing and spluttering, gripping his throat to slow the bleeding as he fights a losing battle for his life.\n\n\nYour enemy’s eyes fall to the rest of the group and he smiles. It is a cruel smile, showing a lust not just for battle, but for the power over life and death. No gladiator can survive long if he is unwilling to kill his opponent in a fight, but that was not a fight. Brasus didn’t even have a weapon.\n\n\nNow the man is slowly moving closer, and despite having the advantage of numbers, it is your group that is backing away. Judging by his appearance, the man is most likely Gallic in origin, fierce and fearless, at least six foot tall, with a deadly weapon, more experience fighting than any of you and on top of that, a ruthless lust for blood. None of your team mates are in any hurry to fight him.\n","page 400":"The conversation is interrupted when Brasus returns without the water he was sent to fetch. \"Uh, Venus and Alexius, Mistress Rhode wants us to get back to training. I tried to tell her what happened, but she got mad. You should probably come quick, before we get into more trouble.\"\n\n\nKnowing better than to risk Rhode’s wrath, Alexius holds his hand against the injury on his head and goes straight back to the arena. You move to follow, but Caecilia reaches out and puts a hand on your shoulder to stop you. \"Wait,\" she says gently. \"I just wanted to ask… Papa told me that people are slaves because the Gods chose them to be. I don’t know if I believe it though,\" she confesses to you in a whisper, as if she’s afraid someone else will hear. \"Why are you a slave?\" she asks.\n\n\nWell, that’s a question with a whole lot of answers. The straight forward story is that your father sold you, but there are other people involved with how you became a slave. The merchant that sold you for one, and her own father for another.

The blow is accurately targeted, and causes her brain to swing violently against her skull, resulting in the girl blacking out and dropping to the ground. She should be out cold for the rest of the battle.\n\n\nThat girl’s going to have a nasty headache when she wakes up, and she’ll no doubt be bruised for weeks to come, but that’s the worst she’ll get out of this fight, which is probably a lot better off than anyone else in the arena.

She’s the only one you’ve ever spoken to about it, besides your brother. \"He owed a lot of people money that he couldn’t pay back, so he sold us both to pay off his debts.\"\n\n\nThe girl just stares at you with her mouth aghast. \"Your own father did that to you?\" she asks, sounding horrified. \"That’s the most terrible thing I’ve ever heard!

As you turn around, you are shocked when you recognise the face of your attacker. It is the small girl who’s life you decided to spare at the beginning of the battle. A dagger is in her hand, dripping blood. Your blood. She must have kept her head low through most of the fight, found a suitable weapon and waited until your backs were all turned to attack. Apparently the girl wasn’t quite so innocent and helpless as she first appeared.\n\n\n\"Unknown!\" Lula cries as she sees you injured. Before your attacker can do any more damage, Lula hurls her trident at the girl, which plunges into her stomach and leaves her screaming on the ground in agony. \"You okay?\" Lula quickly asks you.\n\n\nIn response, you can only grit your teeth and struggle with all your strength to stay standing.

Our home was in Greece, so even if we did run away, we’d never be able to get back.\"\n\n\nCaecilia takes your story in for a second before letting her hand slip from your shoulder. \"That’s really sad,\" she tells you sympathetically. \"You should probably go now, but I hope that you earn your freedom one day, so you and your brother can get a ship to Greece and go back home.\"\n\n\nYou let out a sigh as you return to the arena. You can’t ever go back home, not after what happened, but you don’t bother explaining that to Caecilia.

Quickly jumping in with her javelin, the girl spears the boy right in the centre of his throat.

You do not understand why your master allowed Cato to include him in the fight.\n\n\nRight now, the man is holding Brasus in place with a tight grip of his hair in one hand, and with the other hand, he is holding a spatha, a kind of long broadsword, which he is pointing at the young boy’s throat. \"Please!\" Brasus cries out in a weak, helpless little voice. \"Don’t kill me! I won’t...\" His sentence ends with a gargle as the blade pierces his neck and blood spills out from his throat. Then the man lets go of his hair and he drops Brasus to the ground, the boy still coughing and spluttering, gripping his throat to slow the bleeding as he fights a losing battle for his life.\n\n\nYour enemy’s eyes fall to the rest of the group and he smiles. It is a cruel smile, showing a lust not just for battle, but for the power over life and death. No gladiator can survive long if he is unwilling to kill his opponent in a fight, but that was not a fight. Brasus didn’t even have a weapon.\n\n\nNow the man is slowly moving closer, and despite having the advantage of numbers, it is your group that is backing away. Judging by his appearance, the man is most likely Gallic in origin, fierce and fearless, at least six foot tall, with a deadly weapon, more experience fighting than any of you and on top of that, a ruthless lust for blood. None of your team mates are in any hurry to fight him.\n","page 998":"You’ve heard stories about gladiators that have been granted their freedom, but returned to the arena to fight of their own free will. You never understood this before, but now you think you do. An almost psychotic smile creeps over your face as you look down at the blood that drips from the broken blade of your sword. The crowd around you might cheer whenever they see blood spilt, but they are only watching. They’ll never understand the power you feel right now. The power to take a human life. They can fill their own lives with wine and exotic smoke and every kind of carnal pleasure man can imagine, but they’ll never feel this high that you’re feeling right now.\n\n\nSuch a shame that your first kill was an unarmed boy that was already half dead, but you know there are far more exciting kills to come.

Since coming here, Brasus may well be the only humane influence that Alexius has had, the only one who encouraged your brother to stay gentle and innocent while the rest of the world tried to teach him to be fierce and cold.

I know you scared, but we are need to think now. You be quiet, yes?\" Unfortunately, Lula’s strategy for calming Brasus doesn’t seem to be any more affective than Gerda’s.\n\n\nZeru remains silent as ever. He looks a little tense, but there’s nothing else to indicate whatever it is he’s thinking. Alexius is a much more open book.

Luckily for you all, I was present when your Master and Cato selected the six of Cato’s students that you’ll be competing against. I’m not going to lie, you six have your work cut out for you. Titus chose three of the younger, more inexperienced students, but the three Cato chose are practically adults already. You’ll have a hard time getting the upper hand over any of them. I managed to catch a glimpse of one of the older boys training. He’s strong. I saw him running laps around the practice yard with a heavy sack slung over his back, and that’s pretty much all I can tell you about him. There’s a girl Cato chose with a reputation for quick kills. She does best in group battles, because she uses her team mates to distract her opponents, while she sneaks around behind them and slits their throats. I’ll advise you all to watch your backs, or you might end up with a dagger sticking out of it. As for the last one, he had no business standing in line with the children. Granted, he can’t be any older than seventeen, but I’ve seen him fight before, on more than one occasion, and he’s no child, he’s a hardened gladiator.

Some of you might take pity on the younger ones and try to get them to surrender. Don’t.

There are different kinds of brutality, and no matter how hard I may push you all… How can I put this? … Let’s just say I’ve never demanded that you kill a month old puppy just to see if you would do it. Cato… I certainly wouldn’t put it past him, that’s for sure. Don’t hesitate. Kill them all.

You raise your sword to defend yourself, but don’t get the chance to fight, as the boy suddenly drops to the ground when a three pronged polearm comes flying through the air, tearing through the boy’s leather armour and impaling itself in his side.\n\n\n\"You leave lone, you bastard fuck person!\" Lula shouts at the boy as she grabs the trident by the hilt and yanks it free, leaving him screaming out in pain. \"Now you smart and stay down! No fight for you!\" she tells your opponent very forcefully, who has the good sense to heed her advice and drags himself away from the thick of the battle. Before you can decide whether or not to pursue the boy, you are held in place when Alexius throws his arms around your waist.\n\n\n\"You’re okay!\" your brother cries out in relief. \"Thank Zeus, Unknown, for a second there I thought he’d kill you, for sure!\"\n\n\n\"Ah, you big, strong no need scared.

The spread of weapons across the arena has scattered both groups considerably, and Alexius, Lula and yourself seem to be the only ones trying to fight as a team.\n\n\nGerda looks like she’s having fun. She has a sadistic, bloodthirsty grin plastered across her face as she faces off against a boy in his late teens carrying a large battle axe. Any betting member of the crowd would put all their money on the boy to come out on top, but you know Gerda better than them. She has the pilum in her hands, and that makes all the difference. As soon as the boy swings his axe to attack, Gerda will have her opening. You expect that boy to be dead in a matter of seconds.\n\n\nNear the back of the arena, right by the gate that your team all came out of, you catch a glimpse of Brasus, who doesn’t seem to have moved an inch since he left the cage. He is staring at the battle with wide, terrified eyes and shaking like a leaf in autumn. He hasn’t even picked up a weapon yet. Someone needs to snap him out of it before he gets killed, but you have other things to worry about right now.\n\n\nThe only member of your team who seems to be in any immediate danger is Zeru. He has a large, single edged sword in his hand and is moving in on a young boy holding a bow and arrow. The boy is desperately trying to string the arrow against the bow while he backs away from your most dangerous team mate, but the boy’s hands are trembling, and it’s making him clumsy. Even if he did manage to draw the bow, he wouldn’t have time to aim it before Zeru got to him. You have no doubt your team mate will be able to deal with that younger boy. What does concern you is an older girl with a stabbing pike in her hands who’s gradually sneaking up behind Zeru. The girl is slow and quiet and seems happy to use her younger team mate as a sacrifice to help her get an advantage.

You quickly pull your arm away, but before you can counter attack, Septimus jumps back and retakes a defensive stance as he considers his next move. Your fight goes on like this for a couple of minutes, with a few blows dealt on either side, but neither of you really having the upper hand. You notice that Septimus has a very cautious approach to fighting, often stepping back and studying you to try and find the best place to strike next. This makes it easier to defend yourself since, judging by where he’s looking, you can usually tell what his next move is going to be.\n\n\nAs you plan your next attack, you see Septimus is looking at your left foot, and probably considering tripping you over. This gives you an advantage, since aiming low with his sword would leave Septimus’s upper body defenceless. All you’d have to do is bring your sword down hard enough across his head and the fight would be over. There’s only one problem with that idea, though. Septimus is your master’s son and heir.

He’s actually spitting out blood when he pushes himself back up.\n\n\n\"You little bitch!\" he yells at you, feeling around his mouth until he pulls out an extremely blood-soaked back tooth. \"You’re crazy!

Don’t let them know we’re afraid, make them think we know what we’re doing. And stick together!\" For Zeru’s benefit, you collect six wooden goblets and arrange them on the table in a circle. \"If we stay in a ring, then we have protection from every angle. Hopefully their less experienced students will scatter and we can pick them off one by one. Also, we should arrange it so that the older students are always standing next to the younger ones,\" you say, rearranging the goblets so that they create a pattern of large cup, small cup, large cup, small cup. \"If all the older students are together, they’ll just go after the younger ones and that’ll tear the circle straight through the middle.

The only difference is that now you have a lifeless body and a large pool of blood at your feet.\n\n\nBut you can’t think about that right now. You don’t have time.

She was just a little girl, thrown into her first battle far too young because of a stupid bet. Now she’s gone. She died a terrible death, scared and alone, with no one to protect her. It’s horrible, but right now you have to keep fighting. You need to make sure Alexius doesn’t die the same way.\n","page 892":"Rhode has taught you many things since you came to the academy, but chivalry and fighting fair were not among them. As the Gaul draws nearer, you kick some of the sand from the arena into his face, causing the man to stumble backwards as he tries to wipe the sand out of his eyes. You quickly take this opportunity to charge towards your enemy, who is still disorientated by the sand and only just raises his sword in time to block yours. Your blades clash, sending sparks flying into the air. You are surprised by your own strength as the Gallic man pushes his blade hard against yours in an attempt to knock you backwards, but you manage to hold your ground, keeping your sword in place until your enemy finally swings his blade to the side, letting your sword slip past his as he weaves to the right, before slashing downwards with his spatha.\n\n\nFor the next few moments, the rest of the world is blocked out. You are completely unaware of what is going on around you and the cheers of the crowd slowly die out so all you can hear is the heavy clang of metal against metal as your swords meet and part again and again. You can see the anger in your enemy’s eyes. He thought that a small like you would be an easy target, but despite all your disadvantages, you’re holding your own against him and it makes him furious. It’s his rage that becomes his undoing.\n","page 411":"When you arrive back at the arena, you soon feel the heavy slap of a wooden sword against your back. You turn around and see Lula, grinning at you with a practice sword in each hand. \"Venus, you are do fight with me!\" she declares, throwing one of the swords to you, which you manage to catch by the hilt. \"Mistress is say I good for run fast, but I am need to train fight more, so to kill people,\" the girl seems eerily upbeat when she tells you this.\n\n\nYou don’t really get a chance to respond to Lula’s request, since she takes a swing at you shortly after, which you easily evade. The girl is very aggressive in her fighting technique, quickly turning your spar into a competition of who can hit each other the hardest. Luckily for you, this makes her defence very clumsy.\n\n\nDuring your practice, you manage to knock Lula to the ground by hitting her across the back of the legs with the side of your practice sword. That’s when you hear a loud and rather self-important voice speaking up from behind you. \n\n\n\"Cute,\" he says snidely. \"But I’m afraid that won’t get you girls far in the arena. If you two want to learn how to really fight, you need to practise with someone stronger.\"\n\n\nYou turn around to see a richly clad boy, about two or three years older than you. You’ve never seen him before, but his resemblance to Caecilia is so uncanny that you have no doubt this is the brother she told you about.\n\n\n\"You want I practise you?\" Lula asks, sceptically looking the boy up and down. \"Am thank you, but I stay fight my friend. She being more strong than you, I think.\"\n\n\nThe boy seems surprised and offended that Lula would choose you as a sparring partner over him. He probably saw this as an opportunity to show off, and isn’t pleased that Lula insinuated he looks weaker than a girl. \"You think so, do you?\" he asks irritably. \"Well, maybe she should be the one to spar me, and we can see for ourselves.\"\n\n\n\"Septimus!\" you hear Titus calling from the stairs where he and Rhode are watching you train. \"What have I told you about causing trouble?\"\n\n\n\"I’m not causing trouble!\" his son objects. \"This girl’s learning to fight, I’m just giving her a real challenge,\" he says as he turns back to you. \"Come on, girl. Don’t worry, I promise I’ll go easy on you.\"\n","page 532":"Finding a stick nearby, you sit next to Zeru and start drawing in the dirt beside him. Not really able to think of anything else to draw, you put together a very simple drawing of your old home in Greece, with yourself and your family standing outside. Once it’s finished, you realize that Zeru has stopped work on his own drawing and is looking at your picture instead.\n\n\n\"That’s my home,\" you explain. \"Or it used to be, anyway. I used to live in a little town near Pylos with my family. See, that’s me,\" you say, pointing to the drawing of yourself and then pointing to your actual self, to indicate that the drawing is supposed to be you.\n\n\nZeru watches this then points at the drawing of Alexius before pointing across the practice yard to where Alexius is still playing with his spinning top. \"Yes, that’s my brother,\" you tell him, to which Zeru nods before running his hand through the dirt to rub out the drawing he was doing before. He then starts work on a new picture, very similar to your own, though his drawing skills are considerably superior to yours. Instead of drawing a house though, he draws some kind of rounded, tribal hut, and the family he draws only consist of one boy and a small, thin woman who is hunched over in a way that indicates old age.\n\n\n\"Is that you?\" you ask, pointing at the picture of the boy, and then at Zeru. He doesn’t reply, but the short, curly hair on the boy’s head makes them look very similar. \"And who’s this lady?\" you ask as you point at the old woman. \"Your mother? Grandmother?\" Again, Zeru doesn’t reply.\n\n\nTurning back to your own drawing, you can’t help but feel a sense of longing for the life you used to have. \"We were happy back then, Alexius and me. But then mother died and everything just went to hell,\" you explain, taking the stick and drawing a line through your mother, trying to explain to Zeru that she passed away.\n\n\nZeru watches how you change your picture and then copies you, drawing a line through the old woman in his own picture.\n\n\n\"Did she die too?\" you ask, to which Zeru says nothing. You don’t really have any way of knowing who the old woman was, or whether she and Zeru were related, or even if she died at all. The only thing you have to go by is that Zeru seems sad when he looks down at the picture. \"I’m sorry,\" you tell him.\n\n\n\"... Sorry,\" Zeru replies, though whether he’s expressing his condolences at you losing your mother, or just repeating what you said, you can’t be sure.\n","page 653":"You sit silent and stoic, with your head in your hands, refusing to even look at your brother.\n\n\n\"Venus?\" Alexius says, gently putting his hand on your shoulder, trying to get you to acknowledge him. You shrug it away though. You don’t want to talk right now, not to Alexius or anyone else. Your mind is on other things.\n\n\nVery upset by your dismissal, Alexius starts crying quietly to himself and walks away to sit next to Lula and Brasus. \"No you cry too!\" Lula scolds your brother, but at the same time wraps him up in her arms to comfort him. \"No need for cry, boy, we no die. You are stay me, no scared, I am look after you.\"\n\n\nAlexius seems somewhat comforted by this, but it’s not really Lula he wants to be comforting him in times like this. Still, as time in the academy goes on, the two of you have grown gradually apart, Lula becoming more like a sister to Alexius and you becoming less like a sister. Perhaps if you continue to push Alexius away like this, he might stop coming to you altogether.\n\n\nYou have lost 10 approval with Alexius.\n","page 774":"You turn to get a better look at the rest of the arena, but are distracted when a boy about your own age comes charging towards you, wielding a heavy mace in his hands. You raise your sword to defend yourself, but don’t get the chance to fight, as the boy suddenly drops to the ground when a three pronged polearm comes flying through the air, tearing through the boy’s leather armour and impaling itself in his side.\n\n\n\"You leave lone, you bastard fuck person!\" Lula shouts at the boy as she grabs the trident by the hilt and yanks it free, leaving him screaming out in pain. \"Now you smart and stay down! No fight for you!\" she tells your opponent very forcefully, who has the good sense to heed her advice and drags himself away from the thick of the battle. Before you can decide whether or not to pursue the boy, you are held in place when Alexius throws his arms around your waist.\n\n\n\"You’re okay!\" your brother cries out in relief. \"Thank Zeus, Unknown, for a second there I thought he’d kill you, for sure!\"\n\n\n\"Ah, you big, strong no need scared. You are having small girl for protect you,\" Lula teases you both. \"But if we want fight finish with us not chop in many pieces, then we are need more. We being the small ones, and Alexius is only find little dagger for fight with. I am help you two, but I not being wet nurse. No can watch you all time.

Before this is over, you plan to teach this man never to underestimate a small opponent with something worth fighting for.\n\n\nYou yell out loud as you charge towards your enemy, who is taken aback by your decision to make the first move and only just raises his sword in time to block yours. Your blades clash, sending sparks flying into the air. You fight with all your strength as the Gallic man pushes his blade hard against yours, but your enemy easily overpowers you and under the weight of his blade, you are knocked backwards, giving him even more of an advantage. As the Gaul lifts his sword once again, you manage to quickly roll out of the way before he can bring the weapon down, but after managing to avoid two more swings of his blade, you find yourself trapped when, in attempt to roll out of the way once more, your arm doesn’t move with the rest of your body and you turn to discover the reason why. Your enemy is standing on your sword.\n\n\nYou tug at the blade, but it is too heavily pinned down and you are not strong enough to pull it free. If you do not move quickly, the Gallic man will kill you, but if you let go of your sword, you will have no way of defending yourself. In the next couple of seconds you struggle to make a decision before realising that you are already out of time. Your enemy has raised his sword once more and you do not have time to move before he strikes. A cold, cruel smile spreading across the man’s face is the last thing you ever see in this life.\n\n\nYou have died.\n","page 531":"\"It’s been a few months now, hasn’t it?

Hell, if I didn’t have Alexius here with me, I’d probably just forget that there was anything that came before all of this, you know?\" You don’t expect Zeru to reply, but he doesn’t interrupt either. He raises his head and looks at your brother when you mention his name, but that’s all the indication you get that he’s paying attention to what you’re saying.\n\n\n\"It must be longer for you though,\" you add. \"I mean you’re probably the best fighter in the academy, apart from the adults, I mean. You must’ve been training here for years. I heard you even fought in the arena a couple of times.\" Zeru remains quiet while you’re talking, but once you’re finished, he abandons the picture he was working on and starts a new drawing of a large, circular building with steps going down towards the centre.\n\n\n\"Yes, that’s right, arena!\" you say enthusiastically as you point at the picture. \"So, you’ve really been in there?\" you ask, your tone becoming far more serious. Anxious, even. \"What was it like? Did you ever have to… You know… Kill anyone?\" Again, Zeru doesn’t respond, but shortly after you ask the question, you notice that he’s started to draw a body laying down in the middle of the arena, presumably dead.\n\n\nYou wait for Zeru to finish his drawing before you speak up again. \"You understand a lot more Latin than you let on, don’t you?\" Zeru turns to you briefly when you ask the question, but then goes back to his drawing, without so much as a word to indicate that he understood anything you just said.\n","page 652":"\"What’s going to happen?\" you repeat the question back to your brother. \"We’re all dead! That’s what’s going to fucking happen! You saw the way Rhode looked at us, she knows we’re not going to win! But Titus’s ego is bigger than his brain, so they’re just going to throw us all in the arena like lambs to the slaughter, all because of a stupid bet!\"\n\n\n\"We no lambs!\" Lula scolds you. \"We being people, and we more strong than we looking. We can win fight.\"\n\n\n\"You think so?\" you ask, looking down at Alexius and Brasus. \"Even if those two could hold a sword straight for more than five seconds, do you really think they have what it takes to kill another person? Another child? Just run the sword through them like a sack of flour? Hell, Alexius doesn’t have it in him to swat a fly. They’d never do it.\" Judging by the looks on the younger boys faces, they both agree with you and now Brasus is crying even harder, since you’ve flat out told him he’s going to die.\n\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" Gerda pipes up, shooting an icy glare your way. \"The three of you might pass out at the first sign of blood, but I sure as hell won’t! I’ll butcher the whole lot of them myself if I have to, but that’s not going to be a problem. Zeru’s been in the arena before. He knows what he’s doing. What about you, new girl?\" she asks, directing her question to Lula. \"Think you can gut a couple of the little ones for us?\" Lula doesn’t look happy with the idea, but she nods all the same. When push comes to shove, she’d kill to protect herself and the people she cares about.\n\n\n\"That’s it then,\" Gerda says with an over confident grin. \"You, me and Zeru can win the fight between us.

He probably saw this as an opportunity to show off, and isn’t pleased that Lula insinuated he looks weaker than a girl. \"You think so, do you?\" he asks irritably. \"Well, maybe she should be the one to spar me, and we can see for ourselves.\"\n\n\n\"Septimus!\" you hear Titus calling from the stairs where he and Rhode are watching you train. \"What have I told you about causing trouble?\"\n\n\n\"I’m not causing trouble!\" his son objects. \"This girl’s learning to fight, I’m just giving her a real challenge,\" he says as he turns back to you. \"Come on, girl. Don’t worry, I promise I’ll go easy on you.\"\n","page 534":"\"Here, take this,\" you tell Zeru as you pass him the comb. He studies the gift silently, as if not sure what he’s supposed to do with it, or why you’re giving it to him. \"It’s a comb,\" you explain. \"You know, for brushing your hair.\" You then lift some of your hair with one hand and use the other hand to brush your fingers through your own brown curls.\n\n\nZeru watches you with a raised eyebrow, looking at you like you’re an idiot. He then takes the comb, putting it in his own hair and tugging it through, to demonstrate that he does, in fact, know what a comb is for. Zeru’s hair is much thicker than yours, so it’s more difficult to brush, but he keeps the gift anyway, if only to show his gratitude that you were generous enough to give it to him.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Zeru.\n","page 655":"The six of you are left alone for a couple of hours while Rhode makes arrangements for the fight.

I don’t know what it is, but you just seem so different from the other slaves… Like a normal person.\"\n\n\n\"Slaves are normal people, Caecilia,\" you tell her, unsure if she actually understands this.\n\n\n\"No, that’s not what I…\" Caecilia starts to explain herself, but her words trail off and instead she reaches behind her neck and pulls a golden chain with a charm shaped like the sun over her head. \"Here,\" she says as she holds the chain through the bars, offering it to you. \"It’s the symbol of Apollo, the sun god.

Before you can decide whether or not to pursue the boy, you are held in place when Alexius throws his arms around your waist.\n\n\n\"You’re okay!\" your brother cries out in relief. \"Thank Zeus, Unknown, for a second there I thought he’d kill you, for sure!\"\n\n\n\"Ah, you big, strong no need scared.

Your enemy is standing on your sword.\n\n\nYou tug at the blade, but it is too heavily pinned down and you are not strong enough to pull it free. If you do not move quickly, the Gallic man will kill you, but if you let go of your sword, you will have no way of defending yourself.

Perhaps he doesn’t understand that it’s a gift. \"Take it,\" you insist, holding the apple out closer towards him. \"It’s for you.\"\n\n\nEventually, he takes the apple, seeming almost reluctant about it. When you nod to indicate that you want him to have it though, Zeru finally takes a bite. After finishing his mouthful, Zeru gives you a single word of approval. \"Good,\" is all he says to show his gratitude.\n\n\n\"Well, glad you like it,\" you reply.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Zeru.\n","page 896":"You move quickly to the side, careful to keep your eyes on your attacker as you try to put a few steps distance between yourself and him.

You are completely unaware of what is going on around you and the cheers of the crowd slowly die out so all you can hear is the heavy clang of metal against metal as your swords meet and part again and again.

It’s one of the larger swords in the academy that Rhode only gives to the older and most talented students.\n\n\n\"Here,\" Zeru says, holding the practice sword out towards you. \"Take.\"\n\n\nAt first you think Zeru wants to spar with you, but since it’s a holiday, there aren’t any other practice swords around to fight with, \"Wait, is this for me?\" you ask, pointing to the sword.\n\n\n\"Take,\" Zeru insists, more forcefully than before. This time you do take the sword from his hand, and feel that it’s significantly heavier than the practice swords that you’re used to training with. Once the sword is in your hand, Zeru just turns around and walks away.\n\n\n\"Uhh… Thank you!\" you call after him in gratitude.\n\n\nZeru doesn’t respond.

Since you came to this academy, I’ve done everything I can to prepare you for what’s about to come and all of you are stronger than you know.\" Fixing her eyes on Alexius, Rhode speaks directly to him. \"Taurus Torvus fought in this very arena when he was your age, and I personally witnessed him slay a lion with his bare hands.

Unfortunately, tricks like that are only impressive when they actually work,\" Rhode says with a mocking smile before turning back to Titus. \"Now, can we please move on?\"\n\n\n\"No, I’m still not put off,\" Titus replies. \"Call it a gut feeling, I still think you can make something out of these two.\"\n\n\nRhode looks extremely irritated, but shrugs her shoulders and admits defeat. \"It’s your choice, Master,\" she tells him. \"I still say it’s a waste of coin, but if it is your will, I’ll teach these children to the best of my ability.\"\n\n\n\"I never doubted it,\" Titus says with a pleasant smile, beckoning the ship’s captain over to barter for a price.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Rhode.\n","page 444":"\"... Not really,\" you hesitantly reply. \"Rhode’s been training us really hard and teaching us what to expect, but I don’t know if I’ll ever be ready. Honestly, I’m scared. What if I’m not strong enough? What if I can’t kill other people? I know gladiators are supposed to be brave, but… I just don’t want to die.\"\n\n\nTitus looks surprised by your honest response, but is actually sympathetic. \"Be careful who you share your thoughts with, Rhode would beat you into the ground if she heard you saying that,\" he tells you, but then puts his hand firmly on your shoulder and lowers his voice, so the conversation is just between the pair of you. \"I know you probably think that gladiators are the most fearless people in the world, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. A gladiator needs fear to survive. Think of it this way, bravery is the sword a gladiator uses to fight his enemies, but fear is the shield. It’s the greatest defence you’ll ever have. It makes you careful and clever. Ultimately, it’s what keeps you alive. As for the killing, I’m sure the thought of it must terrify you, I understand that. But when you’re in the arena and it’s your life in the balance, you won’t have time to think. You just act. Once the first kill is out of the way, you’ll find it gets easier every time. So, don’t feel bad about being afraid. Just don’t let your fear control you. You control your fear and use it to make yourself stronger. You understand?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" you nervously reply.\n\n\n\"Good girl,\" Titus says as he fondly ruffles your hair. \"Now, get back to it before Rhode catches you slacking and canes you so hard you won’t be able to sit on your ass for the rest of the week,\" he jokes, leaving you to get back to your training.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Titus.\n","page 565":"What do you want to talk to Gerda about?\n","page 201":"Looking down at the pebble for a moment, you turn back to fix your eyes on Rhode as you address her. \"So, if I do take the pebble, does that mean that I…\" you don’t finish the sentence because talking to the woman was only a distraction. While she’s looking up at you, you quickly reach out and snatch the pebble from her hand before she has time to react.\n\n\n\"What?\" Rhode asks, looking down at her empty hand with a rather surprised expression on her face. \"Sneaky little bitch,\" she says with a grin. \"Can’t believe I fell for that one.\"\n\n\nTitus seems very amused with the trick you played and laughs quietly to himself before resting his hand on Rhode’s shoulder. \"There, not so useless after all. So, what do you say? Think you can make something out of them?\"\n\n\nRhode sighs and gives a shrug of her shoulders. \"Well, it’s a start I suppose.

You tilt your head down and try your best to look innocent.\n\n\nRhode seems to find this amusing, and is laughing quietly at the man’s frustration. \"Well bugger me, you actually hit him.

Do you really think you’re the first slave who’s ever come up with the brilliant idea of running away? Perhaps the first who’s ever been stupid enough to divulge their plans to their master, I’ll grant you that. Still, let’s say you try to run. I’m betting that you either get caught before you even reach the walls, or you turn coward at the first sound you hear and go running back to your bed. But maybe you get lucky, maybe you actually manage to make it over the walls without being seen, and land on the other side without breaking your neck. Then what? How long do you think you’d last, girl? You have nowhere to live, no way of taking care of yourself. What’s more, it won’t take a genius to recognise that you’re a runaway slave.

Having a person in your life that you care about more than yourself is the greatest motivation you’ll ever have. You’ll keep growing stronger and bolder when all the other students have reached their limits, because you have something worth fighting for. But you’re right. You won’t be able to protect your brother, not on your own. You need to be able to fight together. It doesn’t matter how strong you get, girl, there will come a time, many times, when your brother will have to protect himself. What’s more, he’ll have to protect you too. The best thing you can do for your brother is to help him get stronger. Push him to fight harder. Remind him what he’s fighting for. He might be a gentle lad, but if you remind him that his big sister will need protecting some day, that might just motivate him to toughen up a bit, and the stronger and more ruthless your brother gets, the less you’ll have to worry about him.

It’s Feriae Latinae, the Latin Festival. A day for sacrifices to be offered to the Gods, the rich to lavish extravagant gifts on one another, and even slaves are generally granted a day free from labour. Of course, Rhode isn’t exactly pleased with this. If it were up to her, you’d be training all day, every day, but Titus thinks a little rest will do you all a world of good.\n\n\nYou and the rest of the younger students have been given free rein of the practice yard, where everybody seems to be making the most of their short break from training. Some are reading, some are playing chasing games and others are playing with small toys made from stones, carved wax and whatever other trinkets a slave can get their hands on.\n\n\nYou, Alexius and Lula are playing a game that involves throwing little stones into a circle drawn in the sand, to see who can get them closest to the centre. You decide to split the game into teams, and since Lula likes competing with you, she teams up with Alexius. This means you have to choose somebody else to play on your team.\n\n\nYou look around and consider your options. You’ve noticed Gerda playing the game before. She’s very competitive and has incredible aim, so if you chose her to play, you’ll probably win. Brasus has been watching you play for awhile. He seems to really enjoy the game, but rarely gets asked to play since he’s not very good at it. Zeru is sitting on his own, not even attempting to join in with the festivities. He might make a good player, but no one has ever asked him to play, since he doesn’t speak Latin.

Your master is sitting with Rhode on the steps of the arena above you. He watches you all train while Rhode points out specific pupils that she thinks have made the most progress.\n\n\nThis is your chance. It’s the first time you’ve seen your master since he picked you out at the market, and now you have an opportunity to impress him and prove he didn’t waste his money on you. Then again, maybe you don’t want to impress him.\n","page 693":"Before you can react, your mistress grabs hold of your arm with a grip so tight, it’s painful. The other students take notice, but Rhode crouches down so your eyes are level and keeps her voice low so that the conversation stays between the two of you. \"Keep him alive, Venus,\" she commands you. \"No matter what it takes, you keep him alive. You and your brother have something that nobody else in the academy has. You have a purpose, a family, a reason to keep on fighting. Do you know what happens to a person when the only thing they have to fight for is their own survival?\" she asks, shaking you by the arm to make sure you pay attention to what she’s saying. \"You keep your brother alive, that’s how you stay human. Do you understand?\"\n\n\nYou never get a chance to answer. At that moment, you hear the sound of a gong signalling the beginning of the fight, and Rhode instantly lets go of your arm. She can’t distract you now that the battle is about to begin. As the chime of the gong begins to fade, the gates to the arena slowly start to rise, and all the students look around in a frenzied panic. \"Wait, we can’t start now!\" Gerda objects. This has to be the first time you’ve ever seen fear in that girl’s eyes. \"They can’t send us out there yet, we don’t have any swords!\"\n\n\n\"Swords,\" a low voice echoes, and you turn to see Zeru pointing out into the arena where a selection of weapons are scattered across the ground. Things like nets and little daggers are quite close to you, whereas long swords and axes lay in the middle of the arena. That’s when you know it’ll all go to hell. There is no time for strategy, no chance of planning everything with the rest of the group, you won’t even be able to stick together. As soon as the gate begins to rise, Zeru and Lula start crawling underneath it, and you imagine that on the other side of the arena, your opponents are doing the same. If you’re going to have any chance of surviving, you’re going to have to get in the arena right now and run.\n\n\nThe closest weapon to you is a pilum, a long throwing spear that can also be used for thrusting. So far, Rhode has only trained you to use spears as ranged weapons, so you know it won’t protect you for the duration of the battle. Still, you might be able to get one good throw out of it, or possibly give it to an ally that might put it to better use. There’s a small, curved sword called a sica half way across the arena, and you think you should be able to reach it before anyone else, but right in the middle of the arena is the traditional gladius. It’s a longer sword that’ll be able to do much more damage. You’d definitely have a better chance of surviving if you got your hands on that… That is, if you’re fast enough to get to it first.\n\n\nPrecious seconds are passing and you have to decide now. What’s your first move?\n","page 450":"It’s been awhile since Master Titus visited the academy, and after several months of brutal training, you and the other students are granted a well earned day of rest. It’s Feriae Latinae, the Latin Festival. A day for sacrifices to be offered to the Gods, the rich to lavish extravagant gifts on one another, and even slaves are generally granted a day free from labour. Of course, Rhode isn’t exactly pleased with this. If it were up to her, you’d be training all day, every day, but Titus thinks a little rest will do you all a world of good.\n\n\nYou and the rest of the younger students have been given free rein of the practice yard, where everybody seems to be making the most of their short break from training. Some are reading, some are playing chasing games and others are playing with small toys made from stones, carved wax and whatever other trinkets a slave can get their hands on.\n\n\nYou, Alexius and Lula are playing a game that involves throwing little stones into a circle drawn in the sand, to see who can get them closest to the centre. You decide to split the game into teams, and since Lula likes competing with you, she teams up with Alexius. This means you have to choose somebody else to play on your team.\n\n\nYou look around and consider your options. You’ve noticed Gerda playing the game before. She’s very competitive and has incredible aim, so if you chose her to play, you’ll probably win. Brasus has been watching you play for awhile. He seems to really enjoy the game, but rarely gets asked to play since he’s not very good at it. Zeru is sitting on his own, not even attempting to join in with the festivities. He might make a good player, but no one has ever asked him to play, since he doesn’t speak Latin. You look over them all briefly before making your decision.\n","page 571":"What do you want to talk to Gerda about?\n","page 310":"\"We need to learn how to fight, Alexius,\" you tell your brother. \"That means you too, you know? This is a very dangerous place and I’m not always going to be around to look after you. I know it’s hard, but if we’re both going to stay alive, you need to be strong enough to take care of yourself. Do you think you can do that?\"\n\n\nAlexius sobs quietly to himself for awhile. \"I’ll try,\" he whispers. \"I don’t want to fight, but I promise I’ll try.\" With that, Alexius gets up without another word and heads back to his own bed. You suppose it’s for the best. If your brother is going to learn to take care of himself, he might as well start now.\n","page 431":"Well, your master certainly seems cheerful about your impending future of brutal murders and struggling for survival. How about you?\n","page 552":"What do you want to talk to Gerda about?\n","page 673":"With the necklace in your hand, you walk over to your brother and loop the chain over his head. \"Here, you take this,\" you tell Alexius holding up the sun shaped charm. \"Caecilia gave it to me. It’s the symbol of Apollo, the sun god. The charm’s very lucky. I want you to wear it in the fight. It’ll keep you safe.\"\n\n\nAlexius is silent for a moment before wrapping his arms around your neck and clinging to you like he’s afraid to let go. \"I’m so scared, Venus!\" he confesses, but you pat him gently on the back to reassure him.\n\n\n\"I know,\" you tell him. \"But you have to be brave. Don’t worry, it’ll all be over soon. I promise, I’ll protect you.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Alexius.\n","page 794":"You decide to help Zeru deal with the older girl, but you’ll need to choose your next move wisely. The girl clearly knows what she’s doing, and that pike she’s carrying is light weight, which gives her the advantage of speed. Luckily, the girl is preoccupied with Zeru, and hasn’t noticed you yet. Still, you’ll have to think fast if you want to save Zeru before he ends up with that pike impaled in the back of his head.\n\n\nHow do you want to go about this?\n","page 312":"\"Get out of my bed, Alexius,\" you tell him, grumpily. \"We’re not at home any more. You can’t just wake me up every time you’re sad or hungry or need to take a piss. I don’t want to be here either, but I don’t have anybody looking after me, do I? You need to learn to deal with it by yourself.\"\n\n\nAlexius doesn’t say anything else to you, but you hear him crying as he gets up and heads back to his own bed. You have to hold your pillow over your ears that night to drown out the sound of his sobbing.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Alexius.\n","page 433":"You deliberately don’t move your sword quick enough, as Septimus moves in to strike you across the back of the leg, causing you to fall flat on your back. He then stands over you, putting the tip of his wooden sword against your throat to stop you from getting up.\n\n\n\"And that’s how it’s done,\" he says with an incredibly smug look on his face. \"Maybe you’ll get better if you get some proper training done, and stop picking fights with younger girls.\"\n\n\nLula rolls her eyes at the boy, but she doesn’t say anything. She knows you lost on purpose, and she doesn’t want to start any trouble now that the confrontation’s over.\n\n\nNow that he’s had the chance to show off, Septimus seems a lot more agreeable and reaches his hand out to help you to your feet. \"Good fight though,\" he compliments you. \"You did a lot better than I thought you would. It’ll be interesting to see how much you’ve improved when I see you fight for real, in the arena.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Septimus.\n\n\n\"Are you finished playing now?\" you hear your master approach, who has come down into the arena and is looming over the pair of you, sounding quite angry. \"I’ve told you time and again, these slaves are learning to be warriors! You think I built this academy just to fill it with playmates for you?\"\n\n\n\"No, sir,\" Septimus replies, having been effectively scolded.\n\n\n\"Damn right, I didn’t! If you insist on behaving like a child, you can go and play with your sister’s dolls for all I care, just stop bothering the slaves while they’re training!\"\n\n\nSeptimus is glaring down at the ground and clenching his fists in frustration, but he knows better than to argue with his father and instead storms off without another word to either of you.\n\n\nTitus then turns his attention to you, and strangely enough, his expression softens almost immediately. \"Ah, I remember you, you’re that Greek girl. The one with the brother. What was your name again?\"\n\n\n\"Venus,\" you reply, not really sure why your master seems to behave more kindly towards his slaves than his own son, but you suppose you shouldn’t worry about it. It’s better for you at least.\n\n\n\"Yes, you’re quite new, aren’t you? I’m sure Rhode’s been making life miserable as hell for you. I hope so anyway, that’s her job after all,\" Titus says with a jovial laugh that suggests he’s not particularly concerned with the lifetime of physical and emotional scars that the woman tends to leave on her students. \"How are you settling into the academy? Catching up to the other students, are you? Looking forward to your first real fight?\"\n","page 554":"\"You don’t have many friends here, do you?\" you ask Gerda. \"I mean, especially with some of the younger students, you’re kind of…\"\n\n\n\"A bitch?\" Gerda finishes your sentence for you.\n\n\n\"No,\" you object, but then decide you can’t really argue with that. \"Actually yes, if I’m going to be honest, ‘bitch’ pretty much sums it up. Why do you do it though? I mean, by now almost every student in this academy avoids you like you’ve got the plague. What’s the point?\"\n\n\nGerda scoffs at your question. \"You think I give a damn what any of those whore-sons think? Hell, they should all be thanking me. So I start a fight with a few pampered brats fresh off their mother’s tit, what happens? I take their stuff, I beat them senseless, humiliate them a little, so what? They’re going to have to deal with worse than that in the arena, so might as well get used to it now. The smart ones toughen up quick and learn to stay out of my way. Hell, even your dickless little brother is at least trying to hold his sword up straight, so I’d say I’m doing them all a favour, wouldn’t you?\"\n\n\n\"It’s not just the younger ones though,\" you point out. \"I mean you and Lula have been at each other’s throats since we came here, and it’s not like you ever try to make friends with any of the others.\"\n\n\n\"Why bother?\" Gerda asks. \"Half of them will be dead before they’re twenty. Besides, it’s not like having friends is going to help me when I’m in the arena fighting for my life, is it?\"\n\n\n\"Depends,\" you say thoughtfully. \"What if you’re ever in a group battle? Having a few friends on your side might come in useful then.\"\n\n\nGerda genuinely considers what you said for awhile. \"Perhaps. I mean, anyone with half a brain would try to keep the rest of their team alive whether they were friends or not. Still, maybe I should start playing stupid children’s games and braiding the other girl’s hair just to be on the safe side. How about I start with you? I promise I won’t tug any of those pretty locks out while I braid them.\"\n\n\n\"I’m okay, thanks,\" you tell Gerda. Well it doesn’t look like her attitude is going to change over night, but at least you got her thinking.\n","page 675":"You walk over to Brasus and hand him the chain with the sun pendant. \"Here, Brasus, you’re going to need this more than I am,\" you tell him, knowing from watching the boy train that he’s the one least likely to make it out of this battle alive. \"Caecilia gave it to me. It’s the symbol of Apollo. Wear it around your neck and it’ll keep you safe.\"\n\n\n\"You’re giving this to me?\" the boy asks as he nervously takes the chain. \"I… I don’t know what say.\"\n\n\n\"Then don’t say anything,\" you tell him, gently putting your hand on his shoulder. \"Just stay alive.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Brasus.\n","page 311":"\"I don’t know,\" you tell your brother. \"I don’t know what’s going to happen to us, but I promise I’m going to take care of you.

You don’t have the heart to wake him up.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Alexius.\n","page 674":"\"Here, Lula,\" you say, passing her the golden charm. \"Caecilia gave it to me. It’s the symbol of the sun god, Apollo. It’s supposed to be very lucky. Wear the charm around your neck when the fight starts. It’ll keep you safe.\"\n\n\nLula looks down curiously, toying with the little pendant in her hand. \"Amun-Ra is sun god where I from,\" she tells you, smiling as she loops the chain around her neck. \"Why you give this me?\"\n\n\n\"I…\" you mumble, nervously diverting your eyes to the ground. \"To protect you.\"\n\n\nLula lets out a little giggle. \"Silly girl,\" she teases you. \"This no protect me, I protect me.\" Still, she seems to appreciate the gesture anyway.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Lula.\n","page 795":"You decide to help Gerda deal with the older boy she is fighting, but you’ll need to choose your next move wisely.

Still, you’ll have to think fast if you want to save Gerda before she gets her skull split in two.\n\n\nHow do you want to go about this?\n","page 314":"\"Our lives won’t ever be the same,\" you tell Lula. \"Like you said, slavery would be bad no matter what happened, but this is different. We’re going to have to fight to stay alive. People in the arena are going to try and kill us. We’ll have to try and kill them too.\"\n\n\n\"Not now,\" Lula points out. \"Mistress say no for eight year. That long time.\"\n\n\n\"No it’s not,\" you say solemnly. \"Not long enough.\"\n","page 556":"\"Here, Gerda,\" you say as you hand her the apple. \"I saved it for you.\"\n\n\nGerda looks confused, but she doesn’t hesitate to take it. \"You’re seriously giving this to me? Like a present?\" she asks before cruelly laughing at your gift. \"Oh Gods, aren’t you just pathetically adorable? Well, I’m not going to turn my nose up at it,\" she says, taking a large bite out of the fruit. \"Thanks by the way. Turning out to be a good festival, this is the third apple I had today. Brasus gave me his too. Granted, I had to slam his head into the table a few times before he handed it over, but a present’s a present, even if it’s got a little blood on it.\"\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Gerda.\n","page 677":"Walking over to the silent Ethiopian, you hold out the charm for him. \"Here,\" you tell the older boy.

Time to see if all your months of brutal training have paid off. Throwing subtlety to the wind, you shout out as fearsome a battle cry as your twelve year old throat can muster and charge towards the older boy with the axe, who turns away from Gerda to face you. The boy raises his weapon to defend himself and a deafening clang of metal against metal rings out across the arena when your sword meets his axe. Your weapons part and the boy puts all his strength into swinging his battle axe at full force towards your head. Luckily, the heavy weight of the axe makes the boy’s attack slow, allowing you to easily duck beneath it. Before your opponent has time to swing his axe again, you quickly stab your sword through a gap in his armour, right under his arm. The axe goes flying from the boy’s hand and he cries out in pain, using his good hand to clutch at his injury in an unsuccessful attempt to slow the bleeding.\n\n\nHis screams are quickly silenced though, when Gerda shoves the tip of her javelin straight through the back of the boy’s head. He dies instantly. \"You didn’t really think I was going to let you steal my kill, did you?\" Gerda asks with a smirk, kicking the dead boy forward to dislodge her spear from his skull. \"Thought he had me for a second there. Bloody muscle-head was quicker than he looked. Lucky you came along when you did, Greek . Can’t say I was expecting help from you though, to be honest I thought you’d be dead by now, or hiding somewhere and crying like a little bitch. Credit where it’s due, I’m impressed.

When Septimus makes a move to trip you, you bring the hilt of your sword down on his head so hard that it knocks him face first into the ground… Well, if your goal was to humiliate him, that certainly did the trick. He’s actually spitting out blood when he pushes himself back up.\n\n\n\"You little bitch!\" he yells at you, feeling around his mouth until he pulls out an extremely blood-soaked back tooth. \"You’re crazy!

Since you came to this academy, I’ve done everything I can to prepare you for what’s about to come and all of you are stronger than you know.\" Fixing her eyes on Alexius, Rhode speaks directly to him. \"Taurus Torvus fought in this very arena when he was your age, and I personally witnessed him slay a lion with his bare hands.

How about you?\n","page 557":"\"I got you a gift,\" you say, holding the comb out to Gerda.\n\n\nThe girl scoffs and rolls her eyes as she examines your present. \"I already have a comb, you know? You think my hair just falls into place like this when I wake up in the morning?\" she asks, flicking her blonde braid at you.\n\n\nYou’re about to put the comb back in your pocket when Gerda snatches it out of your hand. \"Still, I suppose it can’t hurt to have a spare,\" she says, and that’s the closest thing you’re going to get to a thank you.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Gerda.\n","page 799":"Well, you are in the arena after all. Time to see if all your months of brutal training have paid off. Throwing subtlety to the wind, you shout out as fearsome a battle cry as your twelve year old throat can muster and charge towards the older boy with the axe, who turns away from Gerda to face you. The boy raises his weapon to defend himself, and a deafening clang of metal against metal rings out across the arena when your sword meets his axe. Unfortunately, the boy is a lot stronger than you anticipated and the heavy weight of his battle axe sends your sword flying from your hands. Now you stand before your enemy completely defenceless as he raises his axe to bring down into your skull. But before he can finish you off, the boy cries out in agony and drops his weapon into the sand, the tip of a throwing spear protruding from his chest. His life is over in seconds, and as the boy topples over, Gerda approaches to retrieve the pilum from his back.\n\n\n\"Oh, sweet Minerva, that was pathetic!\" the girl mocks your failure as she kicks your sword back towards you. \"Thank the Gods you had the good sense to make sure I got this spear, or the crowd would be cheering over your blood, bones and brains right now.\"\n\n\nGerda’s taunts cause you to grit your teeth in frustration. \"You know, you could be a little more grateful, I just saved your life after all!\" you tell her as you scoop up your sword by the hilt.\n\n\nGerda scoffs at that. \"Sorry, Greek , but from where I’m standing, I’m the one that saved your life. You just made yourself look weak and stupid in front of hundreds of people. Now get up, stop your whining and count yourself lucky that I didn’t just watch the bastard cut you down before I speared him. Oh, and if by some miracle you actually make it out of this pit with your head still attached, you might want to spend the next few months of training putting a little muscle on those chicken bone arms of yours. The academy doesn’t need runts like you making the rest of us look bad.\"\n","page 318":"It has been about a month now, since you started training to become a gladiator. You have grown a lot stronger in a short space of time, and you’re starting to become more adept with the weapons. When you first came to the academy, you barely knew one end of a sword from the other. Now you can hold your own against the other students your age, some of which have been training at the academy for years. Of course, however much progress you make, there’s always that one thought lurking at the back of your mind. The swords aren’t real.\n\n\nWhen you practice, it doesn’t matter if you fail. All you get are a few scrapes and bruises and you’re back on your feet again the next day, trying to improve. Once you’re in the arena, there’ll be no second chances. Just one mistake, and it’ll all be over… And that’s not the only problem. When you’re a gladiator, you won’t be able to win a fight just by rapping someone across the knuckles until they drop their sword. A time will come when you\u0027ll have other people\u0027s lives at your mercy. Then you\u0027ll discover what kind of person you really are.\n","page 438":"Well, your master certainly seems cheerful about your impending future of brutal murders and struggling for survival. How about you?\n","page 559":"\"One second,\" Gerda says as you get up to leave. \"You just stay there. Stand right there, and don’t move.\"\n\n\n\"Uhh,\" you mumble, puzzled by her randomly giving you orders of where to stand. \"Why can’t I…\" Before you can finish your sentence, your question is answered when Gerda takes one of her darts and throws it right past your ear, so close you think it cut a few hairs off. Turning around, you see that after giving you a trim, the dart hit the wooden target right in the centre. \"Very nice,\" you grumble before starting to walk away.\n\n\n\"Take it,\" Gerda says, indicating to the broken arrow head stuck in the target. \"You should work on your aim. Or, if someone gives you a hard time, you could always jab it in their throats. Whichever works best for you.\"\n\n\nPulling the arrowhead from the target, you examine it briefly before slipping it into your pocket. \"Thanks Gerda.\" It’s so blunt by now that it probably wouldn’t do much damage as a weapon, but using it as a dart might help improve your aim in time.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 Accuracy.\n","page 440":"Well, your master certainly seems cheerful about your impending future of brutal murders and struggling for survival. How about you?\n","page 561":"What do you want to do?\n","page 560":"What do you want to do?\n","page 681":"Once you are all in your armour, Rhode half strides, half stumbles into your cage with a sombre, almost dazed expression. She looks at each of you in turn before raising her voice, summoning as much optimism as she can for a big, motivational speech. \"This isn’t the end,\" she tells you firmly. \"Not one of you is helpless. Since you came to this academy, I’ve done everything I can to prepare you for what’s about to come and all of you are stronger than you know.\" Fixing her eyes on Alexius, Rhode speaks directly to him. \"Taurus Torvus fought in this very arena when he was your age, and I personally witnessed him slay a lion with his bare hands. I expect no less skill or courage from you today. Don’t any of you doubt yourselves, because each and every one of you is coming out of that arena alive. That’s an order!\"\n\n\nWhen Rhode’s speech is over though, Lula makes a point to whisper in your ear. \"Do not you try being brave and stupid and kill with bare hands. You are not warrior cow.\"\n\n\nIt is then you hear the sound of the announcer in the background, charismatically shouting out his introductions to the audience. You can’t quite make out what he’s saying, but it’s followed by a roar of excitement from the crowd. You take a deep breath and try to steady yourself. It’ll begin soon.\n\n\nRhode leans against the bars of the cage next to you, and puts a hand over her forehead. \"Fucking godless bastard,\" you hear her mutter under her breath. Taking a closer look at your mistress, you’re shocked when you catch the faint scent of wine. Not once, even during festival days have you ever known Rhode to touch a sip of alcohol. You don’t understand why now of all times she would choose to break her code of conduct.\n\n\nRhode catches you looking at her and fixes her glazed eyes on you. \"I bet you really hate me, don’t you?\" she asks, lowering her voice so the other students can’t make out what she’s saying. Well, this is a bad situation. Judging by the mood she’s in, there isn’t an answer you could give that wouldn’t just make her more angry. How do you reply?\n","page 343":"\"Zeru, could you spar with me for awhile?\" you ask, approaching the older boy. Of course, he probably has no idea what you just said, but you simplify the question by holding up your wooden sword. \"Fight?\"\n\n\nZeru nods, indicating that he understands. \"Fight,\" he repeats, walking over to you with his own practice sword raised and quickly giving you a nasty strike across your arm, trying to make you drop your sword. You wince at the pain, but manage to keep your grip. Using all the strength you can muster, you return his attack with one of your own, using your wooden sword to hit across his shoulder. Zeru backs away for a moment, looking surprised that you could hit so hard. You think you catch a hint of a smile, which is rare from Zeru. It seems that he appreciates having a worthy opponent.\n\n\nThe fight drags out for quite awhile and you’re both left with several nasty bruises that you’re definitely going to feel in the morning. Eventually, Zeru drops his sword and holds up his hands, signalling that he’s had enough for now. He says nothing, but gives you a respectful clap on the shoulder as he walks away.\n\n\nYou catch Titus and Rhode watching you from above. Titus has a broad grin on his face, clearly having enjoyed watching you fight, and Rhode gives you a nod of approval, glad that you managed to get Titus’s attention.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Zeru.\n","page 464":"\"Where did you get that?\" you ask Alexius, causing him to cup the toy protectively in his hands.\n\n\n\"Lula gave it to me,\" he tells you. \"It was a present for the festival.\"\n\n\n\"So, where did Lula get it?\" you ask. Your brother just shrugs to indicate he doesn’t know and goes back to playing.\n\n\nYou hadn’t really considered the idea of giving gifts for the festival. While the exchanging of gifts is traditional for Feriae Latinae, as a slave, you don’t exactly have much in the way of personal possessions. You suppose there are a few things you own that you could afford to give away. For one, you have an apple that you were given as a special treat this morning. Most of the other students have eaten theirs already, but you decided to save yours for later. Besides that, you have a single candle that is only about half way burned, and a comb Rhode gave you once when your hair grew too wild and needed to be brushed out of your eyes.\n\n\nWhether you give your trinkets away or decide to keep them for yourself, this day off could be a good opportunity to get to know some of the other students better.\n","page 100":"\"Okay, fine,\" you grumble reluctantly before crawling away from what little warmth your itchy, old blanket provided and sitting by the door next to your brother. \n\n\nAlexius gives you a slight smile. \"Thanks,\" he whispers. \"I swear I’m not making it up. They really are talking about us. Just listen to what they’re saying, you’ll see.\" \n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Alexius.\n\n\nYou put your ear to the wall, expecting to hear old friends catching up on what’s been happening in each other’s lives. As you listen though, you begin to understand why Alexius is concerned. You can’t make out exactly what they’re saying, but the Roman stranger seems to be suggesting that your father can no longer provide for you. He asks what kind of life you children can hope to live here when your father can’t afford to put food on the table and your creditors could throw you onto the street at any minute. While the man has a point, you highly doubt he has your best interests at heart. \n\n\nYou can’t make out what the man says next, but you think you can hear your father crying. You share a rather concerned look with Alexius. You’ve heard your father cry before, but only when he’s alone and drunk and thinks nobody is listening. Something must be really wrong for your father to cry openly in front of another man.\n\n\nWhat comes next is confusing. The stranger is offering your father money, but he seems reluctant to take it. You’ve heard your father literally begging men to loan him money before, so why would he hesitate now? After some more hushed words with the stranger, your father finally accepts the money that was offered.\n\n\nAt that point, life as you know it comes crashing down around you. It starts when you hear the stranger telling your father that everything will be okay. Greek slaves are extremely valuable in Rome. You’ll have a better life there than you would here. \n\n\nThat’s when Alexius throws open the door and bursts into the room. \"Papa!\" he shouts frantically as he runs over to your father and clings to his arm. \"Papa, please, I don’t want to go! Don’t let the man take us away!\" \n\n\nAt first you expect your father to do something, to say that this is all a big mistake and you’re not going anywhere. Still, despite how sure of yourself you are, the stranger grabs hold of Alexius, pulling him away from your father’s side, and your father isn’t doing anything to intervene.\n","page 221":"Lula looks quite upset as you and Alexius are released from the rest of the group. \"You be brave,\" she whispers to you both. \"Listen you masters. No do nothing stupid for get beat or whipping. Stay alive.\"\n\n\nThe tattooed woman takes hold of your chains and starts to lead you away, when Titus suddenly puts his hand up to halt her. \"And the girl,\" he says, looking at Lula.\n\n\nRhode seems surprised by this. \"I thought you weren’t interested in buying any cheap Africans,\" she says, irritably.\n\n\n\"I wasn’t, but the women are actually coming into fashion right now. Some men have a taste for the exotic,\" before Rhode can object, Titus asks the Captain her price and it’s low enough that he agrees straight away. \"It might just be a passing fad, but we’ll see if she pays off.\"\n\n\nLula is chained back up next to you and Alexius while your new masters talk quietly amongst themselves. \"What do they want us for?\" you whisper to Lula, since she seems to know what all the masters are looking for in their slaves.\n\n\nThe girl just shrugs her shoulders. \"Not know,\" she admits. \"But we find out soon.\"\n","page 584":"What do you want to do?\n","page 345":"\"Gerda!\" you call out as you head towards the javelin throwing range. \"Give me one of those spears!\"\n\n\nThe girl smirks as you draw nearer. \"Oh, you think you can show me up, do you, Greek girl?\" she asks, sounding extremely confident in herself. Taking one of the javelins, the girl throws it through the air and it lands in the ground right in front of you. \"Go ahead, try your best. Having an amateur like you standing next to me will just make me look better by comparison.\" With that, the girl takes a javelin and hurls it at the straw target, striking it square in the chest.\n\n\nIgnoring the girl’s taunts, you focus on the target in front of you. Making sure your aim and balance are perfect, you send your javelin flying towards the straw man’s head and manage to hit it so hard, the head actually falls off. You can’t help but smile at this, and you definitely catch a glare from Gerda, who now seems worried that she’s going to be the one looking like an amateur.\n\n\nYou and Gerda practice with the javelins for awhile. Gerda’s extremely skilled and manages to hit her targets more often than not, generally in an area that would kill them if the straw targets were real human beings. You, on the other hand, are absolutely flawless. In the short time that you’ve been at the academy, your aim has improved considerably, and today you manage to hit the target in a lethal area every single time.\n\n\n\"That’s enough!\" Gerda says eventually, dropping her javelin on the ground and starting to walk away. She pauses beside you briefly, and for a moment you think she’s going to hit you. Instead, she grits her teeth and forces herself to give you a compliment. \"Not bad,\" is all she can bring herself to say before storming off again. Gerda is clearly mad that you outshone her today, but she still respects your talent.\n\n\nYou catch Titus and Rhode watching you from above. Titus seems very impressed by your skills, and Rhode gives you a nod of approval, glad that you managed to get Titus’s attention.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Gerda.\n","page 466":"\"Where did you get that?\" you ask Alexius, causing him to cup the toy protectively in his hands.\n\n\n\"Lula gave it to me,\" he tells you. \"It was a present for the festival.\"\n\n\n\"So, where did Lula get it?\" you ask.

We’re just going on a little trip, that’s all. A nice little trip to the city.\" \n\n\nYou wait for your father to object but he doesn’t say anything. He just sits there with his head turned away, sobbing quietly to himself. Alexius is still struggling, but the stranger is holding him under one arm without much effort. \"Now,\" the man mutters as he turns around to look towards your room. \"Where’s the other one?\"\n","page 223":"Lula looks quite upset as you and Alexius are released from the rest of the group. \"You be brave,\" she whispers to you both. \"Listen you masters.

You wince at the pain, getting to your knees to pick up your sword again. As soon as you grab the hilt though, Zeru smacks his sword across your back, which knocks you flat on the ground. Perhaps choosing one of the strongest students in the academy as your sparring partner wasn’t such a bright idea.\n\n\nThe rest of the fight is short and painful. The few times you do manage to hit Zeru, he doesn’t seem to feel it, and by the end of the fight, you are covered from head to toe with bruises. It’s not that Zeru is a particularly cruel or violent fighter, he’s just a lot more skilled than you are.\n\n\nAs Zeru walks away to find a training partner closer to his own skill level, you look up to see that Titus and Rhode have been watching you fight. Rhode sighs and gives an agitated shake of her head. You defiantly got Master Titus’s attention, but considering your less than impressive performance, perhaps that wasn’t such a good thing after all.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Rhode.\n","page 586":"What do you want to talk to Brasus about?\n","page 347":"You wave your hands above your head to call the girl over. \"Hey, Lula!

The task seems impossible. You put every ounce of your physical ability into this race, but every time you start to take the lead, Lula puts in an extra burst of effort to push herself ahead of you.\n\n\nBy the end of the race, you feel like your legs are about to fall off, and with one final push, you and Lula both leap over the final hurdle, you pass the finish line less than a second ahead of her. \"I win!\" Lula cheers, holding her arms out in victory as she drops down to sit in the sand.\n\n\nYou are completely exhausted and need a moment to catch your breath before you can say anything. \"Like hell you did!\" you object, sitting down beside her to give your legs a rest. \"I was ahead of you that whole last lap!

You hear Gerda give a snicker behind you. \"Steady, now.

Gerda’s extremely skilled and manages to hit her targets more often than not, generally in an area that would kill them if the straw targets were real human beings. You, on the other hand, are nowhere near as talented. You lost confidence after that first miss, and since then you’ve only managed hit the target in a lethal area a handful of times.

You enter through the doors to see several rows of stairs in a circle around a large pit, coated with sand.\n\n\nRhode leads you into the pit, before carrying on with her speech. \"I will make you work, I will make you weep, I will make you bleed and I will keep you alive! While you are training with me, I expect you to be the best! Not to impress me, not to impress Master Titus! You will be the best because if you are not, you will die!\"\n\n\nYou stop dead in your tracks. Lula’s expression has become detached, trying to block out any sign of emotion. Alexius is trembling as he reaches out to grab your hand and looks up at you, his face gone white with terror. It’s then that you’re hit with the horrible realization. You’re standing in a gladiator arena.\n","page 348":"You wave your hands above your head to call the girl over. \"Hey, Lula! You want to show off?\" you ask her. \"Ten times around the arena. Let’s show Master Titus that we’re the fastest students in the whole academy.\"\n\n\nLula playfully scoffs at that comment. \"We fastest?\" she asks with a smile. \"Silly Venus, I am fastest. I show off for Master. You trip down and fall on face,\" she teases, heading over to the starting point.\n\n\n\"We’ll see,\" you tell her, lining up next to her and leaning forward, ready to start.\n\n\n\"Go!\" Lula screams, getting a seconds head start before you join the race, leaping over hurdles as quickly as you can, trying to overtake her. The task seems impossible. You put every ounce of your physical ability into this race, but every time you start to take the lead, Lula puts in an extra burst of effort to push herself ahead of you.\n\n\nBy the end of the race, you feel like your legs are about to fall off, and with one final push, you and Lula both leap over the final hurdle. Unfortunately, you catch your foot on the hurdle, causing you to fall to the ground, getting some nasty scrapes as you do so.\n\n\n\"Venus!\" Lula calls, forgetting about the race and heading over to lean down next to you. \"You being okay?\" she asks, sounding concerned. \"No running so fast next time, not want you hurt you self.\"\n\n\nLula puts your arm around her shoulder and helps you to your feet. Looking up, you see that Titus and Rhode have been watching you. Rhode sighs and gives an agitated shake of her head. You definitely got Master Titus’s attention, but considering your less than impressive performance, perhaps that wasn’t such a good thing after all.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Rhode.\n","page 108":"You know this can’t be what it looks like, so you push the door open, looking directly at your father. \"Papa, what’s happening?\" you ask, pointing to the stranger that’s holding your brother. \"Who is this man? What does he want? Tell him to leave us alone!\" \n\n\nUnfortunately, your father doesn’t respond to your questions, he just puts his head in his hands and turns away from you both while the Roman moves towards you with a cruel smile on his face. \"Well, it looks like you’re not as smart as your father said you were,\" he says as he takes a firm hold of your arm. \"But we’ll keep that between us. I’ll still make a decent profit on you.\" \n\n\nThe slaver is struggling to keep a grip on both you and your brother, so he temporarily releases Alexius while he binds your hands with rope. Rather than trying to escape though, Alexius just runs back to your father, begging and pleading with him to change his mind. Your father doesn’t respond. He doesn’t even look at Alexius, he just turns away with tears in his eyes as your brother tugs at his sleeve and the slaver finishes binding your arms and legs.\n\n\n\"Now, you stay put while I deal with your brother. Don’t go trying anything stupid, I wouldn’t want to have to knock any of them pearly white teeth out,\" the slaver threatens you, leaving you on the ground as he drags Alexius away from your father once more. Alexius is kicking and screaming, but the man seems no more bothered by this than he would be by a fly buzzing around his ear. \"Oh, come on now, there’s no need for such a fuss. We’re just going for a little ride in my wagon, that’s all.\"\n","page 229":"The initial shock takes a little while to sink in. You knew the life of a slave would be hard, no matter what work you’d be doing. Still, you didn’t expect to be forced to fight and kill other people to ensure your own survival.\n\n\nWith your thoughts all wrapped up in fears for the future, most of what Rhode says simply goes over your head as she shows you around the academy. \"You two will be sleeping in there, with the rest of the girls,\" she tells you and Lula as she gestures to a small building inside the academy walls. \"There’s only a handful of you, so you’ll all be in together. And you, Alexius, was it? You’ll be in that dorm,\" she tells Alexius as she points towards a second building, opposite the girl’s sleeping quarters. \"You’ll start off with the younger boys and then move up to the Fighter’s Dorm once you’re ready for the arena. You’ve got at least eight years of training before you’ll be old enough to fight, so make the most of it. Whoever you were before you came here, I don’t want to know. You’re training in the same academy as the Taurus himself, and you’ll all be judged by his standards.\"\n\n\n\"Taurus?\" you pipe up at the sound of the name. All eyes fix on you and you’ll probably be scolded for interrupting your teacher, but that name has you so excited that you keep talking anyway. \"You mean Taurus Torvus? The greatest gladiator of all time?\" you can’t claim to know much about gladiators in general, but even in your remote little home town in Greece, you’ve heard of Taurus Torvus.\n\n\nLuckily, Rhode seems amused enough by your reaction that you’re not punished for it. \"Greatest gladiator of all time?\" she scoffs. \"I’d say that’s stretching it. Most famous gladiator of a generation would be more accurate. But yes, Taurus Torvus. The Raging Bull. I tell you, that man would charge through the arena, completely obliterating everything in his path. And he trained here, in this academy, where you’re standing now,\" she says proudly before turning to your little brother. \"I remember once, he must’ve been about your age, one of the older students made some insult or other about the Bull’s fighting technique. It enraged him so much that he tackled the boy to the ground, following in an almighty scrap which ended in Taurus biting off the other boy’s ear. So, if any of you were thinking that your youth is an excuse for weakness, I do hope this example clears that up.\"\n\n\n\"What is bull?\" Lula whispers to you, once Rhode has finished talking.\n\n\n\"That’s a male cow,\" you whisper back, which causes Lula to look very confused.\n\n\n\"Cow?\" she asks, raising her voice loud enough that Rhode can hear. \"A cow bite off boy’s ear?\"\n\n\nRhode rolls her eyes at this, but is apparently in a particularly patient mood this morning, and attempts to explain. \"No, not a bull, girl, The Bull! The greatest warrior I’ve ever known.\"\n\n\n\"Cow is warrior in you country?\" Lula asks, even more confused than before. \"Is being train for fight? Like lion or bear?\" A confident smile lights up the girl’s face at the thought. \"Is okay. Is being many cow in my village. Cow no scare me. You want that I fight the cow?\"\n\n\nRhode’s patience finally runs out, and she smacks Lula across the back of the head in an attempt to shut her up. \"No, I do not want you to fight a cow! For now, you can fight with the other students,\" she says as she leads you to a large practice yard, filled with children mostly between the ages of seven and sixteen. \"I still have to sort out that bedding and meals are arranged for the three of you, so for now, I’ll leave you to it. Try to get a feel of the practice swords, listen to a lecture or something. I really don’t care, just keep yourselves busy while I’m gone.\" Rhode orders you, sounding incredibly stressed by the inconvenience of having three new students to provide for. With that, she leaves you all outside the practice yard to figure things out for yourselves.\n","page 590":"What do you want to talk to Brasus about?\n","page 471":"Lula is playing a game with some of the other girls, involving hiding, chasing and a great deal of squealing. \"Venus, come!\" she beckons you over. \"You are play with us, yes?\"\n\n\n\"Maybe later,\" you tell her. \"Can I talk to you?\"\n\n\n\"What is being about?\" she asks.\n","page 592":"What do you want to talk to Brasus about?\n","page 470":"Alexius stops playing with his spinning top long enough to talk to you. \"Hi, Venus. Did you want a turn?\" he asks, holding up the toy.\n\n\n\"That’s okay,\" you say as you sit down beside him. \"I just wanted to talk.\"\n","page 110":"You hear your brother’s cries for help fading into the distance as the slaver drags him out of the house, leaving you alone with your father. For a second, you catch him looking at you with tears in his eyes before quickly turning away again, as if refusing to acknowledge you will ease the guilt of selling his own children to pay off his debts. \n\n\nYou don’t have long. This will probably be the last time you ever see your father before the slaver comes back and takes you away forever. Is there anything you want to say?\n","page 231":"You take a look at the rest of the students who are all training in their own ways. A teenage, Ethiopian boy is practising with wooden swords. A blonde haired girl, who’s a couple of years older than you, is hurling blunted javelins at human-shaped targets made of straw. There is also a younger boy you notice practising with a net, throwing it around as if trying to catch and trap an invisible foe in front of him. It doesn’t look particularly impressive.\n\n\nAlexius and Lula hover around you for a second, all three of you looking lost and out of place. \"So…\" you mumble as your eyes scan the practice yard. \"What are we supposed to do?\"\n\n\nYour brother gives a little shrug. \"I don’t know, but I think I’m going to go over there,\" he says, pointing to a small group of younger students that have gathered around to listen to a man you assume is a tutor at the academy. \"He might be saying something important.\"\n\n\nLula looks over at the group of students and shakes her head. \"No important. If he talk important thing, then everyone listen. Only small people listen, so no important.\" Dismissing the man’s speech, Lula looks around the practice yard for something else to do. \"I go run,\" she decides with a smile. \"Is good for to run fast. No one kill me if no can catch.\"\n\n\nDespite the situation, Lula seems strangely positive. Perhaps the idea of killing others for her survival doesn’t daunt her, or perhaps she’s just trying not to think about it. \"You run with me?\" she asks you, hopefully. \"We see who is most fast.\"\n","page 473":"Gerda’s idea of relaxing seems to be very similar to her idea of training. Even now, she’s working on improving her accuracy by throwing what appear to be broken arrow heads at one of the wooden targets that are usually used for spears. \"You want something, Greek girl?\" she asks you irritably when you approach.\n\n\n\"Not really,\" you reply. \"I just wanted to talk.\"\n\n\n\"Talk then,\" she tells you, going back to throwing her makeshift darts.\n","page 594":"What do you want to talk to Brasus about?\n","page 351":"\"Venus!\" you hear Brasus calling, waving his arms to beckon you over. \"Venus, come quick!\" You’re not sure what the problem is, but it sounds serious, so you follow the boy across the arena to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\nWhen you get there, you see Alexius sitting on the ground with a nasty, bleeding gash on his head. \"Ah, Gods!\" he cries, holding his hand over the injury. \"Venus, it really hurts!\"\n\n\n\"What happened?\" you ask, which causes Brasus to look nervously at his feet.\n\n\n\"I...\" he mumbles, sounding very guilty. \"It was an accident! I was throwing spears and... I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry!\"\n\n\nWell, that explains it. You don’t think you’ve ever seen Brasus actually hit a target with one of those blunted javelins in his life, but somehow he managed to hit your brother instead. Well, what are you going to do about it?\n","page 472":"Typical of his solitary nature, Zeru is sitting by himself, well away from the other students. He is passing the time by using a stick to draw in the dirt. Right now, he’s drawing a picture of a group of the other students playing.\n\n\n\"Not bad,\" you note as you sit down on the ground beside him. He’s actually incredibly talented... You would never have guessed Zeru to be an artist. \"Mind if I talk to you for awhile?\"\n\n\nZeru continues to draw. He doesn’t object to your presence, but he doesn’t acknowledge it either. It’s unlikely you’ll get much conversation out of him.\n","page 211":"Lula looks quite upset as you and Alexius are released from the rest of the group. \"You be brave,\" she whispers to you both. \"Listen you masters. No do nothing stupid for get beat or whipping. Stay alive.\"\n\n\nThe tattooed woman takes hold of your chains and starts to lead you away, when Titus suddenly puts his hand up to halt her. \"And the girl,\" he says, looking at Lula.\n\n\nRhode seems surprised by this. \"I thought you weren’t interested in buying any cheap Africans,\" she says, irritably.\n\n\n\"I wasn’t, but the women are actually coming into fashion right now. Some men have a taste for the exotic,\" before Rhode can object, Titus asks the Captain her price and it’s low enough that he agrees straight away. \"It might just be a passing fad, but we’ll see if she pays off.\"\n\n\nLula is chained back up next to you and Alexius while your new masters talk quietly amongst themselves. \"What do they want us for?\" you whisper to Lula, since she seems to know what all the masters are looking for in their slaves.\n\n\nThe girl just shrugs her shoulders. \"Not know,\" she admits. \"But we find out soon.\"\n","page 332":"You take a look at your options. Challenging another student to a wooden sword fight would probably be the easiest way to get your master’s attention. You notice that Zeru, the Ethiopian boy that doesn’t speak Latin, is brushing up on his swordsmanship. Zeru is about fifteen and one of the best young fighters in the academy. From what you’ve heard, he’s already fought in the arena twice, despite his age, and come out of both battles without a scratch. Beating him would certainly look impressive. Of course, that’s if you can beat him.\n\n\nShowing off your skills with a javelin could also help you impress your master. Right now, Gerda seems to be the only one training with javelins and she is giving it her all, determined to make herself stand out. If you could prove that you’re more accurate than her, it’d certainly draw attention to you.\n\n\nIf you don’t want to practice your sword fighting or javelin throwing, you could just challenge Lula to a race. She’s always competing with you to see who’s the fastest, and there have been hurdles set up around the arena for runners to jump over, so that should make things more interesting.\n\n\nThen again, if you don’t want to catch your master’s attention, you could just aimlessly wander around and do nothing.\n","page 695":"Before you can react, your mistress grabs hold of your arm with a grip so tight, it’s painful. The other students take notice, but Rhode crouches down so your eyes are level and keeps her voice low so that the conversation stays between the two of you. \"Keep him alive, Venus,\" she commands you. \"No matter what it takes, you keep him alive. You and your brother have something that nobody else in the academy has. You have a purpose, a family, a reason to keep on fighting. Do you know what happens to a person when the only thing they have to fight for is their own survival?\" she asks, shaking you by the arm to make sure you pay attention to what she’s saying. \"You keep your brother alive, that’s how you stay human. Do you understand?\"\n\n\nYou never get a chance to answer. At that moment, you hear the sound of a gong signalling the beginning of the fight, and Rhode instantly lets go of your arm. She can’t distract you now that the battle is about to begin. As the chime of the gong begins to fade, the gates to the arena slowly start to rise, and all the students look around in a frenzied panic. \"Wait, we can’t start now!\" Gerda objects. This has to be the first time you’ve ever seen fear in that girl’s eyes. \"They can’t send us out there yet, we don’t have any swords!\"\n\n\n\"Swords,\" a low voice echoes, and you turn to see Zeru pointing out into the arena where a selection of weapons are scattered across the ground. Things like nets and little daggers are quite close to you, whereas long swords and axes lay in the middle of the arena. That’s when you know it’ll all go to hell. There is no time for strategy, no chance of planning everything with the rest of the group, you won’t even be able to stick together. As soon as the gate begins to rise, Zeru and Lula start crawling underneath it, and you imagine that on the other side of the arena, your opponents are doing the same. If you’re going to have any chance of surviving, you’re going to have to get in the arena right now and run.\n\n\nThe closest weapon to you is a pilum, a long throwing spear that can also be used for thrusting. So far, Rhode has only trained you to use spears as ranged weapons, so you know it won’t protect you for the duration of the battle. Still, you might be able to get one good throw out of it, or possibly give it to an ally that might put it to better use. There’s a small, curved sword called a sica half way across the arena, and you think you should be able to reach it before anyone else, but right in the middle of the arena is the traditional gladius. It’s a longer sword that’ll be able to do much more damage. You’d definitely have a better chance of surviving if you got your hands on that… That is, if you’re fast enough to get to it first.\n\n\nPrecious seconds are passing and you have to decide now. What’s your first move?\n","page 452":"It’s been awhile since Master Titus visited the academy, and after several months of brutal training, you and the other students are granted a well earned day of rest. It’s Feriae Latinae, the Latin Festival. A day for sacrifices to be offered to the Gods, the rich to lavish extravagant gifts on one another, and even slaves are generally granted a day free from labour. Of course, Rhode isn’t exactly pleased with this. If it were up to her, you’d be training all day, every day, but Titus thinks a little rest will do you all a world of good.\n\n\nYou and the rest of the younger students have been given free rein of the practice yard, where everybody seems to be making the most of their short break from training. Some are reading, some are playing chasing games and others are playing with small toys made from stones, carved wax and whatever other trinkets a slave can get their hands on.\n\n\nYou, Alexius and Lula are playing a game that involves throwing little stones into a circle drawn in the sand, to see who can get them closest to the centre.

Luckily, this means that spectators cannot see the gladiators that are directly below them, as the high wall blocks their vision. All you have to do is pretend to be running laps around the arena. Once you are directly below the steps on which Titus and Rhode are sitting, and you’re certain they’re not watching you, you stop in your tracks, pressing your back against the wall and falling completely silent, so they have no idea you’re there. From where you stand, you can overhear everything they’re saying.\n\n\nAt first, nothing overly concerns you. Rhode points Gerda out to Titus and explains that, despite her slender frame, she is an extremely talented fighter, with a vicious streak and lust to prove herself. Most of Titus’s attention in on Zeru, and you overhear Rhode state that she thinks the boy is already skilled enough for the arena. In fact, the only reason she isn’t training him with the adults, is that having Zeru as a competitor has a tremendously positive effect on the rest of the children. Everyone strives to live up to Zeru’s standards.\n\n\n\"And what about those Greek siblings I bought recently?\" you overhear Titus ask, quickly grabbing your full attention. \"I take it you’re whipping them into shape?\"\n\n\n\"They’ve made progress, that’s for sure,” Rhode tells him. \"The older sister shows a lot of potential. A few more years, and I might be able to make something out of her. It’s the younger one that concerns me. I wouldn’t say he’s beyond hope yet, but I sure as hell have my work cut out for me with that one. He’s very obedient, I’ll grant him that, but the problem is his attitude. The boy’s still stuck in the past, you see. He doesn’t want to learn. Doesn’t want to spill any blood because he’s afraid his gentle, Greek mother wouldn’t have approved.\"\n\n\n\"Ah, one of those,\" Titus says knowingly, with a mocking chuckle. \"Well, the boy’s just going to have to get over that. The sooner the better. After all, if he doesn’t catch up with the other children soon, he’ll be meeting his sweet mother in the underworld before his first battle is over.\"\n\n\n… Well, that’s certainly given you much to think about. You suppose it’s good to know that Rhode sees potential in you. Still, you hadn’t realised that Alexius was so far behind. Granted, he’s not up to your level yet, but he’s three years younger than you, after all. You’d assumed that was normal. Apparently not. In fact, Titus doesn’t even expect your brother to survive his first battle. You’ll have to do something about this yourself, if you want Alexius to live.\n\n\nStill, you’ve been eavesdropping long enough, and you should really get back to training, before you get caught.

You wince at the pain, getting to your knees to pick up your sword again. As soon as you grab the hilt though, Zeru smacks his sword across your back, which knocks you flat on the ground. Perhaps choosing one of the strongest students in the academy as your sparring partner wasn’t such a bright idea.\n\n\nThe rest of the fight is short and painful. The few times you do manage to hit Zeru, he doesn’t seem to feel it, and by the end of the fight, you are covered from head to toe with bruises. It’s not that Zeru is a particularly cruel or violent fighter, he’s just a lot more skilled than you are.\n\n\nAs Zeru walks away to find a training partner closer to his own skill level, you look up to see that Titus and Rhode have been watching you fight. Rhode sighs and gives an agitated shake of her head. You defiantly got Master Titus’s attention, but considering your less than impressive performance, perhaps that wasn’t such a good thing after all.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Rhode.\n","page 578":"\"How did you end up at the academy, Brasus? You didn’t start out as a slave, did you?\" You don’t know a lot about Brasus but this much is easy to tell. For one, he appears to be of Roman descent but more importantly, he doesn’t act like a slave. The way the boy avoids training as much as he can and asks favours of Rhode despite always being refused, indicates that he’s used to being treated far better than the way he is now.\n\n\n\"No, I’ve only been here for about a year,\" Brasus tells you. \"Actually, I used to be really rich, or at least my father was. He was a good man but… He got into trouble. I’m still not exactly sure what happened. I know there was an important senator that my father was friends with. I really don’t know what the senator said or did that was wrong, but he did something to make the Emperor angry, and he was executed for treason. A lot of the senator’s friends were executed too. My parents…\" For a moment Brasus goes quiet and looks very upset. \"Rhode says I’m lucky I was so young when it happened, or they’d have killed me too. I don’t feel lucky though. I don’t even know what my parents did wrong, but I know they didn’t deserve what happened to them. I don’t deserve what happened to me either. It’s not fair!\"\n\n\n\"No it’s not,\" you agree, but it’s not just what happened to Brasus that you’re talking about.\n","page 699":"You run towards the gladius as fast as you can. As you draw closer, you see that a girl on your opponent’s team is after the same weapon as you, but with a desperate burst of speed, you literally throw yourself towards the sword, skidding across the sand and snatching the gladius by the hilt, just in time before your enemy can grab it.\n\n\nThe gladius has gained you 10 Strength for the duration of the battle.\n\n\nWith the sword in your hand, you roll onto your feet and look into the eyes of your unarmed opponent. This must have been one of the three children that Titus chose to oppose you. The girl must be about the same age as Alexius, with olive skin and long, dark hair hanging in braids on either side of her head. Even if she had a weapon, a girl like this doesn’t look like she could do much harm to anyone. She’s very young, very small, and absolutely terrified. Your sword is inches away from her throat, and you could kill her in a heartbeat without any resistance at all.\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?\n","page 335":"\"Zeru, could you spar with me for awhile?\" you ask, approaching the older boy. Of course, he probably has no idea what you just said, but you simplify the question by holding up your wooden sword. \"Fight?\"\n\n\nZeru nods, indicating that he understands. \"Fight,\" he repeats, walking over to you with his own practice sword raised and quickly giving you a nasty strike across your arm, trying to make you drop your sword. You wince at the pain, but manage to keep your grip. Using all the strength you can muster, you return his attack with one of your own, using your wooden sword to hit across his shoulder. Zeru backs away for a moment, looking surprised that you could hit so hard. You think you catch a hint of a smile, which is rare from Zeru. It seems that he appreciates having a worthy opponent.\n\n\nThe fight drags out for quite awhile and you’re both left with several nasty bruises that you’re definitely going to feel in the morning. Eventually, Zeru drops his sword and holds up his hands, signalling that he’s had enough for now. He says nothing, but gives you a respectful clap on the shoulder as he walks away.\n\n\nYou catch Titus and Rhode watching you from above. Titus has a broad grin on his face, clearly having enjoyed watching you fight, and Rhode gives you a nod of approval, glad that you managed to get Titus’s attention.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Zeru.\n","page 456":"It’s been awhile since Master Titus visited the academy, and after several months of brutal training, you and the other students are granted a well earned day of rest. It’s Feriae Latinae, the Latin Festival. A day for sacrifices to be offered to the Gods, the rich to lavish extravagant gifts on one another, and even slaves are generally granted a day free from labour. Of course, Rhode isn’t exactly pleased with this. If it were up to her, you’d be training all day, every day, but Titus thinks a little rest will do you all a world of good.\n\n\nYou and the rest of the younger students have been given free rein of the practice yard, where everybody seems to be making the most of their short break from training. Some are reading, some are playing chasing games and others are playing with small toys made from stones, carved wax and whatever other trinkets a slave can get their hands on.\n\n\nYou, Alexius and Lula are playing a game that involves throwing little stones into a circle drawn in the sand, to see who can get them closest to the centre. You decide to split the game into teams, and since Lula likes competing with you, she teams up with Alexius. This means you have to choose somebody else to play on your team.\n\n\nYou look around and consider your options. You’ve noticed Gerda playing the game before. She’s very competitive and has incredible aim, so if you chose her to play, you’ll probably win. Brasus has been watching you play for awhile. He seems to really enjoy the game, but rarely gets asked to play since he’s not very good at it. Zeru is sitting on his own, not even attempting to join in with the festivities. He might make a good player, but no one has ever asked him to play, since he doesn’t speak Latin. You look over them all briefly before making your decision.\n","page 577":"\"Are you all right, Brasus?\" you ask pointing to his head. \"You’ve got a nasty bump there.\"\n\n\nBrasus self-consciously moves his hand to cover the bruise. \"Oh that… That was Gerda,\" he mumbles. \"Sometimes the older students start fights with me, or steal my stuff. I keep telling Rhode about it, but she won’t do anything. She says I bring it on myself because I’m weak and I don’t train hard enough.\"\n\n\n\"Why don’t you train harder, then?\" you ask. \"If you got stronger, maybe the others wouldn’t single you out so much.\"\n\n\n\"I try, but I’m just no good at it!\" Brasus says in frustration. \"I’m not supposed to be a fighter! I’m way better at other stuff. I’m smart, and I can read and write really well. Maybe if Master Titus could see it, he might realise that it’d be a waste for me to be a gladiator, and take me to work in his house or something.\"\n\n\n\"Do you really think that’s going to happen though?\" you ask. \"That one day Titus will just pick you out of the group and take you to work as a house slave?\"\n\n\n\"Maybe,\" Brasus mutters. \"I don’t know. I hope so. If Mistress Rhode would just talk to him for me, tell him I don’t belong here… I just hope she says something. I don’t know how much longer I can last.\"\n","page 217":"Lula looks quite upset as you and Alexius are released from the rest of the group. \"You be brave,\" she whispers to you both. \"Listen you masters. No do nothing stupid for get beat or whipping. Stay alive.\"\n\n\nThe tattooed woman takes hold of your chains and starts to lead you away, when Titus suddenly puts his hand up to halt her. \"And the girl,\" he says, looking at Lula.\n\n\nRhode seems surprised by this. \"I thought you weren’t interested in buying any cheap Africans,\" she says, irritably.\n\n\n\"I wasn’t, but the women are actually coming into fashion right now. Some men have a taste for the exotic,\" before Rhode can object, Titus asks the Captain her price and it’s low enough that he agrees straight away. \"It might just be a passing fad, but we’ll see if she pays off.\"\n\n\nLula is chained back up next to you and Alexius while your new masters talk quietly amongst themselves. \"What do they want us for?\" you whisper to Lula, since she seems to know what all the masters are looking for in their slaves.\n\n\nThe girl just shrugs her shoulders. \"Not know,\" she admits. \"But we find out soon.\"\n","page 338":"\"Gerda!\" you call out as you head towards the javelin throwing range. \"Give me one of those spears!\"\n\n\nThe girl smirks as you draw nearer. \"Oh, you think you can show me up, do you, Greek girl?\" she asks, sounding extremely confident in herself. Taking one of the javelins, the girl throws it through the air and it lands in the ground right in front of you. \"Go ahead, try your best. Having an amateur like you standing next to me will just make me look better by comparison.\" With that, the girl takes a javelin and hurls it at the straw target, striking it square in the chest.\n\n\nIgnoring the girl’s taunts, you focus on the target in front of you. Adjusting your aim and balance, you send your javelin flying towards the straw man’s head. Unfortunately, your aim is a little off, and it goes right over the target’s shoulder. You hear Gerda give a snicker behind you. \"Steady, now. Try not to make yourself look too bad, or Master Titus will be too busy laughing at you to notice me.\"\n\n\nYou and Gerda practice with the javelins for awhile. Gerda’s extremely skilled and manages to hit her targets more often than not, generally in an area that would kill them if the straw targets were real human beings. You, on the other hand, are nowhere near as talented. You lost confidence after that first miss, and since then you’ve only managed hit the target in a lethal area a handful of times. More often than not, you miss the target altogether.\n\n\nGerda seems very pleased as she walked away, certain that she made a good impression. Looking up, you see that Titus and Rhode have been watching you. Rhode sighs and gives an agitated shake of her head. You defiantly got Master Titus’s attention, but considering your less than impressive performance, perhaps that wasn’t such a good thing after all.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have lost 5 approval with Rhode.\n","page 459":"\"Hey, Brasus, you want to be on my team?\" you ask the boy.\n\n\nYou can see his face light up when you pick him. \"Can I?\" he asks excitedly, rushing over to take his place next to you, as if he’s worried you’ll change your mind if he doesn’t get there quick enough. \"Don’t worry, I’ll do really well this time, I promise!\"\n\n\nIt turns out to be a promise that the boy can’t keep. You can tell he’s trying really hard, but he just isn’t very good at the game. Your team loses in the end, but at least Brasus seemed to have fun.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Brasus.\n\n\nOnce the game is over, Brasus gets back to whatever he was doing, Lula abandons you to play a chasing game with some of the other girls, and Alexius takes a toy out of his pocket that you’ve never seen in the academy before, a spinning top carved from wood that he repeatedly spins on the ground, trying to keep it from falling over.\n","page 337":"\"Gerda!\" you call out as you head towards the javelin throwing range. \"Give me one of those spears!\"\n\n\nThe girl smirks as you draw nearer. \"Oh, you think you can show me up, do you, Greek girl?\" she asks, sounding extremely confident in herself.

Making sure your aim and balance are perfect, you send your javelin flying towards the straw man’s head and manage to hit it so hard, the head actually falls off. You can’t help but smile at this, and you definitely catch a glare from Gerda, who now seems worried that she’s going to be the one looking like an amateur.\n\n\nYou and Gerda practice with the javelins for awhile. Gerda’s extremely skilled and manages to hit her targets more often than not, generally in an area that would kill them if the straw targets were real human beings. You, on the other hand, are absolutely flawless. In the short time that you’ve been at the academy, your aim has improved considerably, and today you manage to hit the target in a lethal area every single time.\n\n\n\"That’s enough!\" Gerda says eventually, dropping her javelin on the ground and starting to walk away. She pauses beside you briefly, and for a moment you think she’s going to hit you. Instead, she grits her teeth and forces herself to give you a compliment. \"Not bad,\" is all she can bring herself to say before storming off again. Gerda is clearly mad that you outshone her today, but she still respects your talent.\n\n\nYou catch Titus and Rhode watching you from above. Titus seems very impressed by your skills, and Rhode gives you a nod of approval, glad that you managed to get Titus’s attention.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Titus.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Rhode.\n\n\nYou have gained 5 approval with Gerda.\n","page 458":"\"Gerda!\" you call the girl over. \"You want to play stones with us?\"\n\n\nThe girl gives a little scoff when you ask her to join the game. \"You only want me to play because I’m the only chance you’ve got of winning,\" she taunts you, but walks over anyway. \"Don’t worry though, you could put me on a team with a blind monkey, and I’d still win. Just sit back and watch, and try not to drop the stone on your foot when it’s your turn.\"\n\n\nGerda spends most of the game insulting you, Alexius and Lula, whenever you have a bad throw, but at least when it’s her turn, she manages to pull her weight. In the end, picking her as your partner proves to be a good decision, since you win the game by several points.\n\n\nYou have gained 10 approval with Gerda.\n\n\nOnce the game is over, Gerda gets back to whatever she was doing, Lula abandons you to play a chasing game with some of the other girls, and Alexius takes a toy out of his pocket that you’ve never seen in the academy before.

That’s really kind of you. I didn’t get my apple this morning. I mean, the cook gave me one, but Gerda said she’d throw me down the well if I didn’t hand it over to her.

You trip down and fall on face,\" she teases, heading over to the starting point.\n\n\n\"We’ll see,\" you tell her, lining up next to her and leaning forward, ready to start.\n\n\n\"Go!\" Lula screams, getting a seconds head start before you join the race, leaping over hurdles as quickly as you can, trying to overtake her. The task seems impossible. You put every ounce of your physical ability into this race, but every time you start to take the lead, Lula puts in an extra burst of effort to push herself ahead of you.\n\n\nBy the end of the race, you feel like your legs are about to fall off, and with one final push, you and Lula both leap over the final hurdle, you pass the finish line less than a second ahead of her. \"I win!\" Lula cheers, holding her arms out in victory as she drops down to sit in the sand.\n\n\nYou are completely exhausted and need a moment to catch your breath before you can say anything. \"Like hell you did!\" you object, sitting down beside her to give your legs a rest. \"I was ahead of you that whole last lap!

At first, he doesn’t seem to understand the rules, but after watching the rest of you throw stones for a few turns, he starts to pick up on it, and once he understands how to play, it turns out he’s pretty good. In the end, Zeru manages to make up for the mistakes he made at the beginning, and the game is a draw. Of course, you can’t explain the results of the game to Zeru, but he doesn’t seem to care about winning or losing.
