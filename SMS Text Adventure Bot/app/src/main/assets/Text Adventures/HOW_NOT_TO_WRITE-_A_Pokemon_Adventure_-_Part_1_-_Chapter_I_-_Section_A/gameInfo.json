Like it\u0027s older cousin, The Land of Bad Writing, this story uses examples of bad writing as a way of showing how not to write and I don\u0027t have any one story in mind particularly in writing this, just practitioners of bad writing in general.\nI\u0027ve decided to base this story on Pokemon for no other reason than the fact Fan Fiction requires less creativity than most other styles of writing and because Pokemon reminds me of when I was a little Will11 and I, my ten brothers (all coincidently called Will as well) and my nine sisters (the Wilmas 1 to 9) would gather behind the nuclear waste and anthrax testing facility in the woods outside our little trailer park called Asbetos to trade black market Pokemon cards for Plutonium with a mixture of Gypsies, Elves and the Dutch... basically I\u0027m writing about Pokemon because I\u0027m feeling a little Nostalgic today :D\n(Rule 1.5: Don\u0027t write lengthy and pointless descriptions offering fake autobiographies to your readers)."]
