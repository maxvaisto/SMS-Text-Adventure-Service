{"page 6":"Tyson looks somewhat disappointed. You\u0027re not quite sure what he was expecting to happen, but he nods his head and smiles. \"You know you don\u0027t have to thank me. I\u0027ll always be there for you if you need me.\" He strokes your cheek gently.\n\n\nSuddenly, without warning, Tyson leans his face close to yours and kisses you gently on the lips. When he pulls away, he\u0027s blushing.\n\n\nYou stare at him in shock. \"Sorry. I couldn\u0027t help myself.\" He shrugs casually but says nothing else as he walks you home.\n","page 19":"\"Of course not! I\u0027ve been a fool to even think I could win your heart. It was always Isaac. He was older. He was stronger. His hands were undamaged. He was going places! How could you ever love me?\" Tyson looks away, hurt and anger spreading on his face.\n\n\n\"Tyson, no. It\u0027s not like that at all! I just...\" You\u0027re at a loss for words.\n\n\n\"You just what? Tell me! Please! I\u0027d love to know!\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t know, ok? I don\u0027t know...\" You\u0027re starting to tremble.\n\n\nTyson notices your trembling. His voice becomes gentler. \"Kiss me. Really kiss me and tell me you don\u0027t love me.\" He quickly leans toward you and wraps his arms around you, pulling you up against him. He covers your mouth with his and kisses you hungrily. His fingers trail up and down your body. His mouth never stops. His lips are on your neck, trailing along your jaw, and back on your mouth.\n\n\nAs if suddenly realizing he needs to breathe, he stops, still holding you, and comes up for air. \"Do you love me yet?\" He breathes heavily.\n\n\nThat\u0027s when you know your answer, once and for all.\n","page 5":"You were so overcome with emotion, you barely had any time to think before you reached up and gently pulled his face towards yours. Your lips met tenderly, and a small gasp of surprise escaped his lips. But he recovered and realized what was happening. He kissed you with a gentleness you weren\u0027t certain you knew existed. He ran his fingers through your hair and whispered \"Stupid girl\" against your lips as he pulled away.\n","page 18":"\"Do you really?\" With the aid of the moonlight streaming in through the window, you are able to see a smile quickly spread across Tyson\u0027s face. \"Oh, my love!\" He pulls you to him and presses his lips to yours. You feel a wave of heat wash through you as he run his hands through your hair.\n\n\nYou realize this is the first time he\u0027s ever kissed you without that gentleness he usually treats you with. He has replaced that gentleness with a hunger and passion that you find alarming, yet alluring.\n\n\nTyson gently eases you down on his bed and pins you beneath him. He sends fiery trails of kisses up and down your neck, along your jaw, and returns to your mouth, uttering vows of love against your lips. He breathes heavily as he runs his hands over your body and continues kissing you as if the world will end tomorrow. \"My love... oh, how I\u0027ve wanted you for so long!\"\n\n\nBy the early morning, you realize two things: First, you have just given yourself to Tyson. And second, you broke your promise to Isaac...\n","page 8":"\"Where am I?\" Tyson\u0027s eyes are open, and he\u0027s looking around like a lost child.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s ok, Tyson. You\u0027re safe here with me.\" You gently stroke his hair as he takes in his surroundings.\n\n\n\"Did you save my life?\" He asks. You suppose he could\u0027ve bled to death, but you weren\u0027t necessarily the one who saved him. \"Can I thank you for saving my life... like you thanked me?\"\n\n\nObviously a reference to the incident five years earlier. You two never talked about it - or the kiss - since it happened. But you were certain that\u0027s what he\u0027d implied.\n\n\nHe wants to kiss you. Do you let him?\n","page 7":"It\u0027s not long before a few men arrive at your door, hauling the injured Tyson. You lead them into the house and to an empty guest room where they lay him out on the bed. As soon as they have him positioned comfortably, they are on their way.\n\n\nYou realize that Tyson is drifting in and out of a state of consciousness. You do everything your mother taught you to do when you were young to treat an injury like Tyson\u0027s. All that\u0027s left to do is wait.\n\n\nSo you hold his hand and sit patiently.\n","page 2":"It is the mailman, you realize with excitement after opening the door! But he doesn\u0027t have a letter from Isaac. It\u0027s a letter from the man who runs the factory where Tyson, Isaac\u0027s younger brother, works. Tyson had apparently been injured while working the assembly line. He was badly hurt and had nowhere to go. So they were sending him to you. No questions asked. He needed to be taken care of, and you were the only likely candidate for the job. Real doctors were much to busy taking care of injured soldiers to devote their time to a young man who couldn\u0027t even fight their war.\n\n\nTyson had broken some bones in his right hand when he was fifteen, and because the injury was never treated, they did not heal properly, resulting in partial loss of the functions in his hand. Therefore, he was useless, except to sit in a factory all day, producing weapons.\n\n\nNo one ever let him forget how his injury affected his daily life and his ability to be useful. They would constantly make him miserable, taunting and teasing.\n\n\nBut not you. He saved your life. You never believed he was useless...\n","page 1":"You sit up abruptly and pull your sheets securely around your chest. It was just another dream about Isaac\u0027s departure, you realize. You\u0027ve been having a lot of those lately, even though it\u0027s been two months since he left. You haven\u0027t heard anything from him since about a week and a half after he arrived at his destination. It was nothing particularly heartwarming. Just a letter to say he was alive and would write soon. But he never did. He couldn\u0027t be dead, though, you think. Surely, someone would have informed you by now.\n\n\nSuddenly, you hear a knock at the door, interrupting your thoughts. You really don\u0027t feel like getting up. You didn\u0027t sleep well last night. On the other hand, it could be the mailman with a letter from Isaac.\n","page 4":"You were fourteen years old. It had already been a year since the accident when Tyson broke his hand, but he was still having trouble getting used to the fact that he didn\u0027t have full control over it.\n\n\nYou were walking along the beach one afternoon. You knew Tyson was at the top of a hill not far from the shore, watching you. There were signs of a storm coming in, but you didn\u0027t care. You wanted to be alone. You\u0027re father had just died, leaving you with only an aunt to take care of you.\n\n\nNaturally, you didn\u0027t notice (or maybe you just didn\u0027t care) when a huge wave came up the beach straight towards you. You had never been a strong swimmer, so when the wave dragged you into the raging ocean, you pretty much gave in.\n\n\nBut Tyson would not allow you to be stolen so easily. The next thing you knew, you were being carried out of the water in his strong, muscular arms. \"Stupid, stupid girl...\" He crooned gently as he stroked your hair. You weren\u0027t sure, but you thought he might\u0027ve had tears in his eyes.\n\n\nHow do you thank someone for just saving your life?\n","page 11":"When Tyson wakes up a few hours later, you sit next to his bed. You have prepared a meal for him, realizing he must be starving. He sits up carefully, wincing in pain as his injuries are once again agitated.\n\n\n\"Be careful.\" You say gently, resting your hand softly against his chest.\n\n\nHe looks up at you and sighs. He has an odd expression on his face, but you can\u0027t decide what he might be thinking about. \"Well, nurse,\" he says, his expression returning back to normal, \"I hate to be a bother, but I\u0027m really rather famished.\"\n\n\n\"Right. Here you go.\" You lift the plate out towards him, and he struggles to obtain it, his injuries obviously causing him extreme discomfort.\n","page 33":"Tyson smiles, his eyes shimmering in the moonlight streaming in through the window. \"I hoped so! Oh, my love!\"\n\n\nHe recovers instantly from his previous lack of breath. He instantly begins trailing kisses along every inch of your exposed flesh. His hands are restless. He wants more.\n\n\nYou suddenly realize you are willing to let him have more. He can have all of you, if that\u0027s what he wants.\n\n\n\"Do you want me?\" Your whispers are intoxicating.\n\n\nTyson nods his head, breathing raggedly against your skin.\n\n\nIt is well into the morning when you realize you have just broken your promise to Isaac.\n","page 10":"\"Tyson... I\u0027m sorry. We shouldn\u0027t. Isaac...\" You trail off.\n\n\n\"No, I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have asked. I just... I\u0027ve been wanting to kiss you again so badly ever since that day. But you were always his, weren\u0027t you?\" He looks away sadly.\n\n\n\"Tyson...\" You reach for his hand, but he pulls away.\n\n\n\"No, it\u0027s ok. I\u0027m fine with it. I\u0027m sure you two will be very happy once Isaac gets back. You\u0027ll get married, have his children, grow old together... But. Remember what I said, ok? Because I meant it. I\u0027ll always be there for you, even if you don\u0027t want me.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you.\" You whisper as you rise to leave. \"Get some rest, alright?\"\n","page 32":"Tyson\u0027s face suddenly draws a blank expression. He had expected this response, but he was obviously hoping you\u0027d changed your mind. He gently pushes you away. \"Please. Leave.\" His voice cracks.\n\n\nYour heart breaks seeing him this way. \"Tyson, I-\" He cuts you off.\n\n\n\"No. I don\u0027t want to hear it. Just go!\" His voice rises.\n\n\nWhen you wake the next morning, you realize Tyson is gone.\n","page 13":"You watch as Tyson struggles to position himself to eat. He makes slow progress in trying to feed himself. Every movement causes a flash of pain to course through him.\n\n\nYou would do anything to alleviate his pain, however, you don\u0027t want him getting the wrong idea. So instead, you wince as you watch him suffer.\n\n\nWhen he\u0027s finally finished, he looks at you pathetically. \"You are a wonderful cook. I only wish I could\u0027ve enjoyed your meal under more favorable circumstances.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m so sorry! You look miserable!\" You whine sadly.\n\n\n\"No, no, darling. It\u0027s alright, really. I\u0027m going to be honest. I don\u0027t mind it so much.\" He reaches out to take your hand and groans in pain. \"I don\u0027t mind because I get to be with you.\" He gently kisses your wrist.\n\n\nYou have difficulty suppressing a smile.\n","page 35":"Isaac had returned from the war three months after that night when you refused Tyson. You and Isaac were married in a simple ceremony.\n\n\nYou were glad you decided to wait for Isaac. You loved him dearly, and it seemed as if not seeing you for so long had made him somehow more affectionate.\n\n\nYou were, however, sorry for the pain you caused Tyson. By this time, Tyson had become an infamous drunk. He was known for taking many women into his home constantly. More interesting was the fact that it was noted that he preferred a certain type of woman\u0027s company. And when this type of woman was described to you, the description sounded remarkably like you.\n\n\nYou were certain it wasn\u0027t a coincidence.\n\n\nYou and Isaac were soon expecting your first child. Isaac was out working one day. That\u0027s when the contractions started. You needed someone - anyone - there with you.\n\n\nAnd that\u0027s when he showed up. Tyson. You looked at him with utter surprise and disbelief evident on your face.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll always be here for you.\" That was all he said. That was all he needed to say.\n\n\nBy the time Isaac got home, Tyson was long gone. In his place was a beautiful baby girl.\n","page 12":"His pain is too much for you to bear. Your hand instantly retracts, removing the dish from Tyson\u0027s reach. A distraught look quickly spreads upon his face. \"Why?\" He asks pathetically.\n\n\nYou shake your head. \"I\u0027m going to feed you. Whether you want me to or not. I can\u0027t stand seeing you grimace every time you move. So I\u0027ll do it.\"\n\n\nYou receive a look of shock in response. Possibly from the fact that you\u0027re treating him like a baby, or maybe just because of your extreme air of authority. But he doesn\u0027t object.\n\n\nYou scoop manageable bites into his mouth as he lays there helplessly. Every now and then, between bites, he\u0027ll send a small smile your way. Probably his less embarrassing way of thanking you for playing the role of his mother.\n\n\nAfter you\u0027ve fed him the last of his meal, you stand to go wash his dishes. But before you have time to make it a step away from Tyson\u0027s bed, he snatches your hand and sends an audible groan of agony through the room.\n\n\nHe had his purpose in mind, however, so as you stand there with a worried look on your face, he draws your hand towards his lips and plants a delicate kiss on your wrist. \"Thank you.\" He whispers for the second time that day.\n","page 34":"It has been three months since you and Tyson consummated your love for each other. You realize that there is no way to hide your affair from Isaac, if he returns.\n\n\nYou are pregnant.\n\n\nTyson returned to the factory two short weeks after your night of bliss. You haven\u0027t seen him since, but he\u0027s always sending flowers and writing to you. In his last letter, he informed you that he would be visiting in a week.\n\n\nHe doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re pregnant yet, but you plan on telling him when he arrives.\n\n\nYou spend the week preparing for his arrival. On the day of his arrival, you hear a knock at the door. You rush to the door, expecting to find Tyson. Instead, you are greeted by the mailman.\n\n\nIt is a letter from Isaac. He is coming home in three days.\n","page 15":"You carefully lead Tyson out of the house. He blinks a few times, his eyes readjusting to the bright sun he hasn\u0027t seen in forever. \"Where to?\" You ask.\n\n\nTyson thinks silently for a moment, then turns to you with a grin. \"I think I know just the place.\" He takes your small, soft hand in his firm, yet gentle, grasp.\n\n\nThe two of you walk in comfortable silence for a while until you realize where he\u0027s leading you. Just below the hill where the two of you now stand, you can see the beach. Not just any beach. The beach where Tyson saved your life five years ago.\n\n\nHe leads you down the hill, then turns to you with a bashful expression. \"I figured now was as good a time as any to talk about what happened that day.\" He presses your hand firmly over his heart. \"You must know I had certain... feelings for you. I don\u0027t honestly know that I would\u0027ve jumped in a raging ocean for just anyone.\"\n\n\nYou feel a wave of heat cross your face. You suppose you probably had figured that out by now, you just never wanted to consider the implications of what had occurred that day. Even back then, it was a known fact that Isaac had claimed you. You begin to wonder if you ever gave Tyson a fair chance.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not asking you to come out and say you\u0027ve always secretly been in love with me. But... I do hope that maybe you\u0027ll start to consider - truly consider - how you feel about me.\"\n","page 9":"He\u0027s injured. You don\u0027t feel as if you can refuse him. So you nod your head and lean close.\n\n\nHe gently reaches towards you, even though he clearly has pain in his arm, and pulls your face the remaining distance so your lips meet. You realize this is the first time the two of you have kissed since that day.\n\n\nHis lips are warm and soft against yours, not tainted with seawater as they were last time. He strokes your cheek gently as his mouth refamiliarizes itself with yours.\n\n\nThen suddenly, you pull away as if remembering something. You\u0027re engaged to his brother. For all either of you know, he may not be alive. But you are his. And you wouldn\u0027t betray his brother... Would you?\n\n\n\"Thank you.\" He whispers softly, as he closes his eyes to rest.\n","page 14":"It\u0027s been several weeks since you\u0027ve taken Tyson into your home.
