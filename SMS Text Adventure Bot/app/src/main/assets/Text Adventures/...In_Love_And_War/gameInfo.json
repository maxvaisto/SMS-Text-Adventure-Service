  "You are a young woman whose betrothed has gone off to fight in the war. You dream of his return and pray for his safety every night. Before he left, you promised you would wait for him. But you begin to feel lonely. Now the question that eats away at you is not whether he is still alive or not, but whether you are willing to wait long enough to find out.\n\nNote: There are three possible endings, but a few different ways to reach them. This is also my first storygame, so constructive criticism is appreciated."
