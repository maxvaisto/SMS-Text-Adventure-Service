The door is wide open, so you just let yourself in. You walk up to the greenhouse, and climb the wooden ladder that leads you there.\n\n\n“Have either of you seen a cat?” Tholi yells, frustrated.\n\n\nYou enter the greenhouse. Massive glass walls enclose a large room filled with every plant imaginable. It makes Blaise’s garden look like a weed growing out of a clump of dirt. Rows of roses, various small trees, endless amounts of shrubs, berry bushes, flowers and other fine pieces of greenery. In the center, standing perfectly still and fast asleep, is a Life Elemental. The massive, nine foot figure seems to be a massive talking tree with wooden arms and legs, with leaves and flowers growing from it’s body. It’s face, which looks like a master wood carver has carved it into the bark, is closed and asleep, with leaves growing across its chest that go up and down as it snores. An Elemental is a creature that is the embodiment of a magical element, in this case life, that has no morality besides the spreading of its own element. Because of this, Life Elementals are relatively pacifistic, although the issues they cause, such as destroying buildings to make room for plant life, digging up corpses for fertilizer and wiping out any loggers in the area make it an unwelcome guest to all but the Wood Elves. Still, since Tholi has managed to keep this one relatively tame, she’s allowed to use it as a gardener and a last line of defense should the house be attacked. You stare at the horrible be plant-beast, having some hate for it, but Blaise simply walks up to it and rubs it’s side. It’s eyes open, pure black, and Blaise slowly checks the various plants that make up its body for infection or disease, before letting the Elemental sleep again. She then drops to her knees and begins to tend to a bed of strange flowers that you vaguely remember being called Forgetting Flowers, or Never-Forget Flowers, or some other nonsense flower name like that.\n\n\n“Put the crate down in the corner,” Tholi shouts, and you do so.\n\n\n“Why did you have a cat?” you ask.\n\n\n“Some of the more… dangerous plants require a bit of food with a more… blood in it. I’m happy to kill a cat, they’re all just rat-killing monsters. No emotion, cats. I despise the little buggers.”\n\n\nYou shrug, and nod, before you head over, as you always do, to the Cranberry Tree.\n\n\n\"Dagden, if you have a single cranberry from that tree, I will murder you.\"\n\n\n\"Please?\"\n\n\n\"No, Dagden.\"\n\n\n\"If I\u0027m good can I make a pie? Can I have the pie you made? I saw you making pies earlier.\"\n\n\n\"The pies I made have been ordered by a merchant caravan staying in the city.\"\n\n\nSuddenly, you hear a loud banging on the door.\n\n\n“Go get that, will you?” Tholi says.\n\n\nYou nod, and quickly slide down the ladder. You run up to the door, to be faced with the rotting smile and sharpened grin that you haven\u0027t seen in years..\n\n\n“Trent, Kai. What the hell are…?”\n\n\n“It’s time to get out of Kashin. The Alliance is falling apart. There’s men waiting on the border to launch an invasion of the Elves and Dwarves, breaking into another war. The Orcs don’t seem to be preparing for war, well, not anymore than usual, although I’m sure they’ll hire themselves out to both sides,” Sir Trent says.\n\n\n“That’s… good for us, isn’t it?” you ask.\n\n\n“In a way. There’s quite a few more bands of adventurers and heroes searching around, a lot looking for Blaise.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“A patsy. They need a  patsy to blame for their troubles. They can’t mend the Alliance through love, but they can do so with hate. Demons, Necromancers, the strange men across the Great Sea, anything they can unite against.

I...\"\n\n\nYou listen to Kai\u0027s terrible singing, until you reach the city gates. Massive steel gates cover the tunnel down underground. The gates are guarded by a massive Orc, a Dwarf holding a battleaxe, and a massive giant humanoid creature chained to the wall.\n\n\n\"What the hell...?\" you say.\n\n\n\"Jack!\" Kai says, running up to the massive creature. \"Who\u0027s the best troll in the world?\"\n\n\nHe grips the massive troll in a bear hug, and to your surprise the troll doesn\u0027t tear Kai\u0027s head off.\n\n\n\"Hey!

He lets out a long laugh, which turns to a yell as his body begins to twist and break. His bones snap as his limbs stretch wider and his head and body grows. His face is torn apart as his teeth grow and sharpen past their usual point. Hair sprouts from his body, and you hear the Elves scream and curse. Within a few seconds, you\u0027re faced with the fearsome creature known as a Werewolf. \n\n\n\"Holy shit! He\u0027s a werewolf!\" Blaise gasps.\n\n\nKai roars, and charges forward. He swings his claw, beheading an Elf, before he lunges at another. Within a few seconds, he\u0027s bitten out the throat of another Elf and tore open the stomach of another. In about a minute, the Elves lie tore apart with a bloody Werewolf standing above them, gobbling on the guts of a dead Elf.\n\n\n\"What do we do?\" Blaise whispers.\n\n\nThe Werewolf stops, before turning and staring at you. It lets out a roar, and begins slowly heading towards you, growling.\n","page 245":"You stumble around in the darkness, looking for a way out. Your foot hits a rock and you trip. You reach your hands out to stop the ground, but you find yourself falling, flailing around while trying to grab onto something. You scream as your body smashes into the ground with a sickening thud.\n","page 487":"Chapter V: The Rise of the Reaper\n\n\nIn the small city of Kashin, time flies. The community’s large enough that there’s always something new to do unlike back with Reaper Castle, and you begin to learn all of the town’s secrets. The hidden stash of hallucinogenic mushrooms that you learn belongs to old Mrs DeAngelo, the old scouting tunnels that were used to spy for enemies, the barred off Dwarven Mines that lead to a nesting ground for bats, even the secret room behind the school that’s being used as a distillery of a cheap knock off of Dwarven Mead. The heat for Blaise lasts for longer than expected, with some light patrols and even some wandering Heroes arriving in search for two refugees. Still, they’re easy to hide from with the help of Tholi. As time passes on you begin reading some of the many books that fills the great library that Tholi has collected over the years, with your interests including the making of a fine ale to the history of the Orcish Tribes off towards the cold, inhospitable Northern mountains. You practice with your weapons and Blood Magic everyday, and Blaise eagerly collects any bandit corpses or dying carcasses to bring back to life and train with, before eventually allowing them to depart from this realm once she’s finished. The time flies incredibly quickly. You wait patiently as fewer and fewer faces arrive looking for Blaise, and to a much lesser extent, you. The large WANTED: NECROMANCER posters that once plastered the town slowly give way to newer and more important issues, such as WANTED: BANDIT CHIEFTAIN or WANTED: FORGER as Blaise’s name fades from the headlines. As well as this, you can tell from Newspapers that the so called “Alliance” has fallen apart without a threat to unite against. Orc Raiders attack human communities, humans expand into Orc territory, the Dwarves stay as xenophobic and isolated as ever and tension flares within the Elves as the Wood Elves demand peace, the Dark Elves embark on business ventures and mercenary works for the enemies of the Elves and the High Elves try to expand their empire. This quickly leads to infighting, before the Alliance falls apart. Minor skirmishes break out as soldiers class along changing borders. Not only is the Alliance dead, it’s only a matter of time before wars break out. Still, this has little effect on the tiny community of Kashin, which continues to act as a home for the various Undead, Exiled and Scum of this plane.\n\n\n“Dagden! I need you to head out with Blaise to the market!” Tholi yells from across your stone home.\n\n\n“For what?” you reply with a shout.\n\n\n“There’s a new shipment of flowers, fertilisers and seeds. I need you to pick it up from Mr Tabernius. There’s coin and breakfast by the table. I’ve left some extra money for whatever you feel like doing, around 100 coins.”\n\n\nOf course it’s flowers and other gardening stuff. What else could it possibly be? Tholi is, quite ironically, a Plant and Life Mage. Blaise’s love of gardening, which again is incredibly ironic for a master of death, has only got them to get along better than ever. The massive greenhouse, which is one of the few buildings that goes above ground in Kashin, is an impressive thing to behold. Through magic, skill and a lot of hard work, she’s made an incredible and very impressive garden. From what you’ve heard, Tholi’s made quite a bit of coin selling impossible to find herbs to the Merchant Caravans. You clamber out of your bed and quickly get dressed in a rough woolen tunic, before walking downstairs. Blaise sits there, eating a bowl of grapes. A second, untouched bowl sits next to her, which you eagerly grab and begin to dig into. You toss one to Stitches, who lies on the ground off to the side, half-asleep. You shovel the plump purple grapes into your gob, as Tholi appears.\n\n\n“Good morning,\" she says cheerfully.\n\n\n“What flowers are coming in, Tholi?” Blaise asks eagerly.\n\n\n“Ah, there’s some Purple Dragon Tongue, Silver Bells, Sunshine Pitchers, Black Roses and some Daffodils, I think. You’d be surprised how hard it is to find good daffodils.”\n\n\n“Cool,\" Blaise says, pushing her empty bowl away. “Are you ready, Dag?”\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, your mouth full. You stand, pop on your boots, and begin heading out the door. Blaise grabs the bag of coins, and you walk with her. At this stage, you both know the town like the back of your hand. You pass the Grave, an Inn who’s primary market are the many undead who once served Dante and now hide, scared to lose their “lives” for a second time in their existence. You pass the Silver Chalice Tavern, Da’qiq’s General Store and several large stone homes build into the caves. You look up at the stone roof that would’ve plunged the cavern into darkness without the massive and numerous torches that covered the cavern walls and every building inside. You eventually find yourself at Mr Tibernius’ Master Store. The building is unoccupied nine months of the year as Mr Tibernius travels across the world and, according to some, visits other planes of existence, collecting everything from ornate candlesticks to dark tomes that speak the name of creatures that could burn this world to ash if they simply noticed it.\n","page 248":"Eternal Sleep\n\n\nYour life force is taken from you as you enter the endless sleep of death.\n","page 247":"While the Dragon is distracted, you break into a sprint.

As you near the end of the cave, you come across a horrific scene.\n\n\n\"Fuck me,\" Kai says in surprise.\n\n\nDozens of slain human corpses lie in a pile, surrounded by zombies. The zombies have abandoned all intelligence, and are eagerly chewing into the pile of corpses. As they spot you, they growl and begin stumbling towards you. Blaise screams and backs away, before you catch her. You raise an eyebrow, and she nods. She takes a deep breath, and begins to whisper to herself. The zombies stop heading towards you, and begin tearing each other apart.

Within a few seconds, you\u0027re faced with the fearsome creature known as a Werewolf. \n\n\n\"Holy shit! He\u0027s a werewolf!\" Blaise gasps.\n\n\nKai roars, and charges forward. He swings his claw, beheading an Elf, before he lunges at another. Within a few seconds, he\u0027s bitten out the throat of another Elf and tore open the stomach of another.

You see a couple new Necromancers and Mercenaries among the crowd of undead. Blaise sits at the head of the table, as you realize how differently you were raised. Blaise\u0027s mum is dead and her father is rarely around, although she\u0027s spoiled by riches. Your parents were always there, but they never spoiled you. You decide you got the better deal.\n\n\n\"OK, bring out the gifts! Happy birthday, Blaise!\" Dante yells.\n\n\nYou look at Blaise as she begins to receive her gifts. A large ceramic bowl covered with decorations of wild and fantastic beasts which you’re told is of High Elf creation, is presented to her, filled to the brim with large, plump red fruit the size of a man’s head. You stare eagerly as more gifts are brought in, looking for anything interesting among the boring, “pretty” gifts. You see Blaise is given several new dresses made of various materials, ranging from a plain white cotton dress to a sparkling blue dress made from fine silk. Then there’s some more bland, banal gifts, before you spot something of interest, a large oak box with golden trim. Taylor opens it slowly, revealing a polished, shining dagger made of pure black.\n\n\n\"It’s obsidian. A choice tool of magic users from the Pyromaniac of Igia Falls to the Demon Price Narxhall to Grand Elder Hyde. You’ve become so skilled at Necromancy I think you deserve a weapon. The obsidian blade is performing rituals and brutally stabbing all your enemies. I hope you like it.”\n\n\n“Thanks. I love it,\" Blaise says, hugging her father.\n\n\nThe next few gifts are interesting and decorative, including a shining dragon egg with the dragon inside now dead, a full set of Elven Archer Armor on a stand that’s far too big for her to ever wear and is purely decorative, and a massive Dragon skull the size of Blaise that takes four undead beings to carry it. As well as her father’s endless barrage of gifts, the Necromancers, some mercenaries and even some Wights and Revenants give her presents, ranging from flowers for her garden to jewelry to clothes. All this makes your gift seem rather inadequate. You feel Mort run along your arm to sit on your shoulder, and gently stroke his head. You’ve got used to the little monster. You check your pocket, to find your gift’s still there.\n\n\nThe necklace wraps around your wrist. It’s chain is iron, the links scavenged off the many undead who inhabit the castle, no longer having any need for their jewelry. Hanging from the chain is the large dragon fang that was so hard to obtain, the pendant of the entire gift.\n","page 5":"\"Orc?\"\n\n\n\"Ha! Orc?

Do you want to go to the garden?\"\n\n\n\"Sure,\" you nod. \"But won\u0027t the others be annoyed or...?\"\n\n\n\"They\u0027re all far too drunk to notice. If we\u0027re back in time for the dinner feast, we\u0027ll be fine.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and quickly follow Blaise, exiting into her room. You push the bookshelf out of the way, and enter the hidden room, before entering the tunnels. You walk along the tunnels, then the hallways, before arriving at the garden.\n\n\n\"The flowers are looking good,\" you mention.\n\n\n\"Yeah, they are. The endless supply of bone meal that comes from being a Necromancer\u0027s daughter does help growth.\"\n\n\nBlaise leaps up through the tree branches and quickly climbs the tree. You follow after her, climbing the tree and reaching the top. You lie across the branches like you always do, as does Blaise.\n\n\n\"So...\" Blaise begins.\n\n\n\"So?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"What\u0027d you get me for my birthday? Is it a puppy?\"\n\n\n\"My friendship.\"\n\n\n\"I already had that. What I didn\u0027t have was a puppy.\"\n\n\n\"Well my friendship\u0027s better than a puppy.\"\n\n\n\"Seriously, what\u0027d you get me?\"\n\n\n\"A necklace,\" you say, sliding your hand into your pocket.\n","page 7":"\"Stag?\"\n\n\n\"Ha! Stag bone\u0027s better for feeding the dogs! It\u0027s dragon bone. A fierce, fiery red Dragon, slain by your grandfather Chieftain Torag. Alright, then. I have a damn many axes that need to be forged. Go now, Dagden, and make sure that knife tastes a lot of blood in its life.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, Lurkhim.\"\n\n\n\"Of course,\" Lurkhim smiles.\n\n\n\"Come on, Dag, let\u0027s go home,\" Bagig says.\n","page 267":"As you begin the walk over, Dante grabs your shoulder.\n\n\n\"Dagden. I\u0027m having one of my zombies bring your birthday gifts to your room.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"I also got you this,\" he says.\n\n\nHe drops a golden necklace with a giant diamond in your hands. You stare at the clearly feminine piece of jewelry for a second.\n\n\n\"Is... Am I supposed to wear this?\"\n\n\n\"No, of course not. I doubted you\u0027d be able to get Blaise a gift, so I got you one for her.\"\n\n\n\"Oh. Thanks.\"\n\n\n\"If you don\u0027t want to give it to her, that\u0027s alright. I just wanted to give you the option.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and Dante disappears off to command some zombies to bring out the food.\n\n\n\"Come on, sit! Time to feast!\" Dante cries.\n\n\nYou sit down, sliding both necklaces into your pocket. You\u0027ll give Blaise her gift later. You sit down, noticing Blaise sits at the head of the table in Dante\u0027s spot while Dante sits in Blaise\u0027s.\n\n\n\"Happy Birthday, Blaise. Having fun?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I am,\" Blaise smiles. \"So, did you get me a gift? Is it edible? Is it a puppy?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll give it to you later,\" you smile.\n\n\nThe undead, monstrosity that you\u0027ve come to love known as Stitches rushes out, and you begin to rub his back. You\u0027ve managed to teach Stitches not to eat Mort, so you\u0027re happy to have them both around. An undead zombie drops a plate of steaks, Blaise\u0027s favorite food, in front of you. You watch with many mixed emotions as Blaise eagerly snatches up a steak and crams it into her mouth. You have no idea how, but the massive chunk of meat is gone within seconds. You find it interesting that someone so small and skinny is able to consume so much. Maybe it\u0027s a human thing.\n\n\n\"A toast!\" Dante cries, raising a golden goblet. \"To Blaise, may she have a long and prosperous life!\"\n\n\nYou grab a mug of frothy wort beer and raise it.\n\n\n\"Cheers!\" you say and hear in return from everyone at the table.\n\n\nYou take a long drink, and put the mug down. You impale a piece of steak with a fork, and begin to eat your lunch eagerly.\n","page 2":"You take a few swings of your blade. It takes some effort and strength to properly swing the heavy blade, but it does work quite well.\n\n\n\"Hey! Watch it, you little shit!\" Bagig growls, as you realize you\u0027ve sliced open his knee.\n\n\n\"Oops.\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s already drawn blood. A promising start,\" Lurkhim grins.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re not called Red Blades for nothing,\" Bagig says, rubbing dirt into the cut.\n\n\n\"Sheath your blade, Dag, you\u0027re not in a battle yet, despite how much you may hope,\" she says, handing over a tiny leather belt that looks custom made for you. \n\n\nYou put the belt on and quickly sheath the weapon.\n\n\n\"Now, shall we get you a dagger? A dagger for Dag? Fitting.\"\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, as she takes you over to a row of knives. You look through them.\n\n\n\"Go ahead. Pick your favorite. You can tell a lot about an Orc from the dagger he picks. Whether it\u0027s gilded or plain, big or small, large or short...\"\n\n\nYou quickly eye your favorite.\n\n\n\"That one.\"\n\n\nLurkhim laughs, picking it up. It\u0027s a deadly sharp knife made of bone, simple yet elegant.\n\n\n\"Ha! I like your choice! So many boys your age pick the biggest or the shiniest. You know what you want, Dagden.\"\n\n\nYou smile, as she hands you the knife.\n\n\n\"Keep it in your boot, so you always have it. An Orc should never be caught without a blade handy. Do you know what kind of knife that is, Dagden? What kind of bone is it?\"\n","page 269":"You pull out the Dragon tooth necklace, and hand it to her. Her eyes widen.\n\n\n\"Is that a...?\"\n\n\n\"Dragon tooth? Yeah.\"\n\n\n\"I love it. It\u0027s beautiful,\" she says, putting it around her neck. \"Thank you. It\u0027s the best gift I\u0027ve even gotten. How did you even get it?\"\n\n\n\"I snuck out the night we saw the dragon and stole it from the dragon\u0027s nest.\"\n\n\n\"You idiot!

There\u0027s explosion of moving flames bursts across his palm, taking the form of a landmass emerging from the sea, than a massive forest growing, then a city emerging from the forest. If you squint your eyes, you can see horrific acts of slaughter and torture taking place in the city. Finally, the white ball drops down, changing into a man with a coat and top hat, who walks into the city.

She was the most beautiful baby I\u0027d ever seen. The most beautiful human being I\u0027ve ever seen. She\u0027s even prettier than her mother, may her soul find peace. When I met Annabelle, I thought I could never be in love more than I was with her. Blaise proved me wrong. I love Blaise more than anything in the world. I would abandon everything just to make her happy. So sweetheart, happy birthday, I love you, and you\u0027ll be the best goddamn... er... person ever!\"\n\n\nDante collapses into his chair to a polite round of applause, although Blaise seems genuinely touched by this.\n\n\n\"Happy birthday, Blaise,\" you say. \"May the next few years bring good fortune and luck for us all.\"\n","page 276":"After another two hours of drinking and feasting with Dante, other Necromancers and Mercenaries, all of who are far too pissed to even realize you exist let alone weren\u0027t there.

You do happen to spot Mr Nilvos trying to drunkenly convince Dante that he \"knows a really, really cool demon who would make this party so much better after a goat sacrifice or two\". You also spot Balok the Honorless drinking mugs of ale and Necromancer Trant having wine in a corner. You\u0027ll enjoy butchering them, eventually.

He says he has a newborn empire to command, and its slowly growing through small military engagements and negotiations, giving him more and more jobs that need to be done. You and Blaise continue to bond, although at this point you\u0027ve both explored pretty much everywhere and done everything there is to be done. You\u0027ve found the mass grave hidden under the kitchens, you found the hidden room filled with paintings under Dante\u0027s bedroom, you\u0027ve even discovered the escape tunnel that links through the tunnels through a hidden door. You find it odd that the hidden door is only accessible through going through tunnels that themselves can only be accessed through hidden doors. You also devise many, many plans and ways to butcher Necromancer Trant and Balok the Honorless, though boredom is the main reason behind that.\n\n\nAlthough the boring castle stays the same, as you hit twelve and then thirteen, you change. As you reach maturity, you grow in size. Puberty hits you especially hard and early, even for an Orc. You become taller, larger and stronger as your muscle mass rapidly increases. You teeth sharpen, your skin toughens and your strength. speed, endurance and stamina increase. Your maturity also heightens your abilities in Blood Magic. Mr Nilvos tells you that this is natural, and your puberty is awakening your dormant magic abilities. This further helps you become the killing machine you\u0027ve become.\n\n\nBlaise also matures, in different ways. Her magical abilities increase substantially. She gains control of her lightning powers, but those are pathetic in comparison with her necromancy. Her necromancy powers awaken and allow her control over the dead and the ability to raise them on a level unknown to her before. She\u0027s improving so quickly that she\u0027ll outclass her father much sooner than expected. She also changes in some other ways, that may or may not affect you in new and weird ways and awaken some primal part of you.\n\n\nYou sit in Mr Nilvos\u0027 Class, watching Blaise work. She stands surrounded by a circle of dead corpses, lying around her. She closes her eyes and begins whispering to herself, and the corpses begin to stand. They growl, and turn to look at Blaise. The dead salute, before drawing swords from their side. They all stab themselves through the heart, and collapse.\n\n\n\"Good, good. Well done, Blaise. Though I would\u0027ve preferred if you had them leave my class before killing themselves.\"\n\n\n\"Oh yeah. Sorry,\" Blaise blushes.\n\n\n\"Alright, let\u0027s finish for the day. We\u0027ll meet back here tomorrow and see what other undead monstrosities can be raised.\"\n\n\nStitches runs into the room, barking happily.\n\n\n\"Perhaps we\u0027ll kill the mongrel tomorrow,\" Mr Nilvos says, staring disdainfully at the dog. \"Dagden, practice your blood magic. Try to see if you can master breaking through a door when powered by blood sacrifice.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and follow Blaise and Stitches out of the room eagerly, heading straight to Dante\u0027s private Chambers. Tomorrow is the day of the Ceremony of Pledging. The various Necromancers, Mercenary Captains, Lords, Ladies, Mayors and Politicians who hold positions of power among the new empire of undeath are going to meet at Reaper Castle to pledge their loyalty to the Grand Necromancer. This means there\u0027s going to be a massive celebration and people coming from across the land, which will draw powerful and rich merchants from across the globe and all the goods and valuables that they bring, which can only be good.\n\n\n\"Dad! Dad!\" Blaise shouts, rushing ahead of you and arriving at Dante\u0027s room, before sharply knocking.\n\n\nDante opens the door, dressed in his Necromancer Robes.\n\n\n\"Ah, Blaise! Is your class finished already? That Dark Elf is getting lazier. Well, what is it?\"\n\n\n\"Have any of the Merchant Caravans come to supply the Ceremony of Pledging?\"\n\n\n\"Not to my knowledge.

Now, go along, They\u0027re in James\u0027 Barracks. I need to be alone, I need time to prepare. Some of the guests are arriving today, I need to get ready.\"\n\n\nBlaise nods, and Dante closes the door. You follow Blaise out towards James\u0027 Barracks, and knock on the oak door. The door is opened by a tall figure wearing a top hat and a black coat with purple trim.\n\n\n\"Ah, Children! I love children!

I’m half-scared of you.”\n\n\nYou touch your face and a small amount of the white face paint that’s painted your face into that of a leering skull comes off.\n\n\n“I’m in facepaint.”\n\n\n“It’s not facepaint. It’s… war paint. Don’t Orcs wear warpaint?”\n\n\n“It’s usually blood, not chalk.”\n\n\n“Well, skull’s aren’t red.”\n\n\nYou look down at the young faces of the children, seeing mixtures of awe and terror as you both approach. The children seem to be between six and sixteen years of age.\n\n\n“Are there none older?” you ask in surprise.\n\n\n“All the older ones were killed, imprisoned or fled the area. I don’t they’d come back after nearlhy dying in service of the last necromancer.”\n\n\nYou stare at the children. Most are human, but a surprising number are Elves. Very few are Dwarves and Orcs, but that’s to be expected. You didn’t expect to see a lot of greenskin representation here.\n\n\n“Greetings, Grand Necromancer,” a voice cries.\n\n\nYou turn to see that Lady Eli is back. She’s looking a lot more friendly now that you’re in charge of her town.\n\n\n“Hello, Lady Eli,” Blaise says.\n\n\nYou stare briefly at Lady Eli, before going back to the children.\n\n\n“Ladies and Gentlemen, I am the Grand Necromancer. I have come here to decide which of you will join me as Necromancers,” Blaise announces me. “I will decide which of you, if willing, are to under go the journey to mastery over death.”\n\n\n“You will each be given an obsidian blade, and will fight to the death. The winners shall be allowed to become Necromancers,” you shout, and many of the children begin to panic.\n\n\n“He’s joking!” Blaise shouts. “You said you wouldn’t scare them.”\n\n\n“I said I wouldn’t kill them. That’s it.”\n\n\nBlaise rolls her eyes.\n\n\n“We’re only taking those over twelve, the strongest we can find. I’ll pick out the best ones I can find, and you go through those and do a… psychological profile. Ween out the cowards and weaklings.”\n\n\nYou nod, dismounting from your horse. Some villager hands you a goblet of purple liquid, which you eagerly down. To your relief, it’s alcohol rather than poison, which you probably should’ve checked for beforehand. You watch as Blaise first sends away the young children, then those whose necromantic potential isn’t good enough or ready yet. Finally, you’re left with twenty kids. Six are around your age or a bit younger, with eight being just into their teens, and a final six who have barely passed Blaise’s set age limit. Most are humans, with a few exceptions; there’s a Wood and High Elf who are both barely passing the age limit, an Orc slightly younger than you, a High Elf that’s your age and two Dark Elves just into their teens as well as one your age. You walk forward, grinning. Time to sort out the weak from the strong.\n\n\n“Alright, I am General Dagden Dragontooth, General under the Dead Empire, Bearsbane, Red Blade, Survivor of the Fall of Reaper Castle, Envoy of the Grand Necromancer, Blood Mage and soon to be, Child Killer. I’m here to kill the weakest of you so there’s more food for the strong, got it? If at any point you want to leave, the door’s open. If you die, your families will be compensated. So, which of you are going to Choose Life and fuck off?”\n\n\nOne old kid, two young teens and surprisingly, only one small kid leave.\n\n\n“Good. Those were the smart ones,\" you say. “Now, as per Necromancer tradition, we’re going to need a bit of a sacrifice for the next part. If you’ve noticed, most famous Necromancer’s are missing their left ring finger.”\n\n\n“The Grand Necromancer has all of her fingers,” the young High Elf girl points out.\n\n\n“We had to flee before the Grand Necromancer. I’m impressed you notice, so you can keep yours. Everyone else, line up.”\n\n\nYou manage to scare off another three kids, bringing the total down to thirteen. You draw your dagger, and are faced with the tiny Wood Elf boy. He has short, combed brown hair and bright green eyes. You doubt he\u0027s much older than eight.\n\n\n“How old are you, kid?”\n\n\n“Twelve.”\n\n\n“You look fucking six.”\n\n\nThe Wood Elf shrugs, holding out his left hand. You have to admit, he has balls. You draw your bone dagger, holding it to the Wood Elf’s ring finger. He doesn’t flinch.\n\n\n“Fuck it, kid. You’ve got a pair on you, you know that?”\n\n\n“A pair of what?”\n\n\nYou roll your eyes with a snicker at his naivety.\n\n\n“Go stand with the other Elf. You can keep your finger.”\n\n\nThe Wood Elf smiles and happily bounds off. You’re then faced with a tall girl around your age.\n\n\n“I don’t believe you’re going to cut off our fingers. You’re just trying to scare us.”\n\n\nOK, she called your bluff. Time to act fast.\n","page 425":"\"I don\u0027t know.

Maybe if you were willing to slide a few coins...\"\n\n\n\"Maybe I could be a little more open about the information of your... current status. Tell me, was there a warrior\u0027s heaven or just darkness or...?\" Blaise asks.\n\n\n\"Ah, quiet down. No one needs to know. There\u0027s a few choices of escort. There\u0027s Kai, he usually drinks here. There\u0027s Sir Trent, who\u0027s currently in hiding because... he suffers the same... ailment as I do. Then there\u0027s the Golden Hand, a group of Heroes who were part of the assault of Reaper Castle. None of them are here now, but if I spread the word, they\u0027ll all probably be here within a few hours.\"\n\n\n\"Yes. Do that, and your secrets safe with me.\"\n\n\nThe undead Bartender nods.\n\n\n\"Oh, and we need a room.\"\n\n\n\"We don\u0027t have rooms to rent here.\"\n\n\n\"Where can we get a room, then?\"\n\n\n\"Old Legless\u0027 Inn just down the road.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you nod.\n\n\nThe undead bartender walks away from the bar.\n\n\n\"Good,\" Blaise says.\n\n\nBlaise takes a drink from her mug, and stares at you.\n\n\n\"I have an idea.\"\n\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\n\"What if we take over?\"\n\n\n\"The tavern?\"\n\n\n\"My dad\u0027s empire.\"\n\n\n\"Is this a joke?\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t mean now.

Hundreds of Undead stand, with more defending or garrisoned at the many towns joining the new Dead Empire. Several Revenants stand at the front of the army. Five Flesh Monstrosities stand among the crowd, with a massive dragon standing tall above them.\n\n\n\"Gods, I am feeling so powerful right now. Power really does corrupt. What do most insane dictators do?\" Blaise asks happily.\n\n\n\"Wipe out civilians? Burn orphanages? Make a heir?\" you suggest.\n\n\n\"A heir? That could work. A cute little, slightly green baby to dress up\"\n\n\n\"The first-born\u0027s definitely a son, who we\u0027ll name Bagig, and we\u0027re not dressing Baby Bagig up.\"\n\n\n\"What?

You continue trying to cheer up Blaise as she continues to reminisce about her father. She breaks into tears quite a few times, but you manage to cheer her up every time. Eventually, as the sun begins to fall, you spot a town in the distance.\n\n\n\"What town is that?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Northtower.

You see several rotting corpses piled around the town, probably the zombie and skeleton guards who were executed to dissuade the various armies from partaking in a brutal invasion. As you walk into the town, your hear a shout.\n\n\n\"Hold up!\"\n\n\nYou have Mort run down into your leather bag, while Blaise wraps Stitches rotting areas in a blanket.\n\n\nYou turn to see a woman walking towards you with a crossbow.\n\n\n\"Hold it right there.

It\u0027ll take a bit longer to search you, make sure you\u0027re not bringing in any illegal contraband.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and the woman leans in and quickly pats down your pockets.

You open it, to find a journal entry.\n\n\nDay 64\n\n\nWe found it. We finally found it! We were ordered to secure the area by Declan, and we dragged the body into a nearby cave, just South of here, obscured by some rocks and reeds we put out. Fuck, it took a lot of effort, even with magic. It\u0027d be a lot easier if we had our Mercenary Escorts, but fuckin\u0027 Declan had to sacrifice them to some demon he owed.

Which ways South?\"\n\n\nBlaise rolls her eyes, and begins marching down the valley. You follow, searching, until you notice several rocks and piled up dried weeds partially obscuring a large cave mouth. You push the rocks out of the way and throw the reeds out of the way.\n\n\n\"Do you have a torch?\" you ask.\n\n\nBlaise shakes her head, before flicking her fingers. A small candle light bursts into fire in her palm, before growing to a large size.\n\n\n\"You can do fire magic now?\" you ask in surprise\n\n\n“I mean, I wouldn’t say I’m good at it. I’ve mastered candlelight, and that’s it. I’m barely able to maintain this.”\n\n\nYou shrug, and begin walking down the cave. Massive gouges line the stone walls, and ash lies around the mouth, faintly blowing in the breeze. You walk further, until eventually you notice flashes of bone among the dirt. You brushes off the dirt, and are faced with a massive dragon skeleton.. It’s head is the size of a large horse, its teeth long and deadly sharp like short swords and daggers.  It body is larger than the average dragon, it’s wings still holding the unrotting, leathery membrane that gave it flight.\n\n\n“So… what do you think?” Blaise asks.\n\n\n“It’s... smaller than I imagined.”\n\n\n“It’s beautiful,” Blaise says in awe. “It’s one of the most beautiful creatures I’ve ever seen.”\n\n\nYou shrug.\n\n\n“I suppose. We’ll get more. Soon we’ll have a whole army of skeletal dragons.”\n\n\nBlaise grins, and sits by the dragon head, closing hey eyes and putting a hand on its forehead.\n\n\n“This might take some time, If I were you, I’d take a nap,” Blaise says.\n\n\nBlaise walks over and pulls out a healing potion from the many hidden pockets in her robes, and gives it to you.\n\n\n“Thanks,” you grunt, downing the sweet mixture.\n\n\nYou have to admit, after the fighting and travel, you’re quite tired. You bandage your wounds and collapse onto the ground, cushioning your head on a rock.\n","page 200":"You look at all the various books.

Another bandit grabs another, and uses his teeth to open his throat. There\u0027s a frenzy of conflict as the bandits begin to tear each other apart. You\u0027re let go, and stumble away from the bloodshed.

I’ve survived worse.”\n\n\nStitches stands up, and whines. Blaise quickly begins to rub his head and say something things to calm down her dog. The Bandit leader struggles against the rotten hands clawing at him, and Blaise looks at him.\n\n\n“Come on, you undead rats!

He… ah, what a coincidence.”\n\n\nThe door is kicked open, and a large man walks in. He has long braided hair, and wears only a pair of stained pants.

Kai rolls out of the way, before leaping into action. In a feral, brutal charge, Kai slaughters them. He beheads the first with one blow, before brutally clawing the second\u0027s face and biting out his throat. He hacks off the third\u0027s arm and stabs him through the stomach repeatedly, before finally slashing the final man\u0027s throat.\n\n\n\"Woo!\" Kai yells, punching a fist into the air.\n\n\nHe drops to his knees, pulling the straps of a breastplate, and using his machete to cut strips of meat from the corpse of one of Golden Hand, which he eagerly tears into.\n\n\n\"Here is not the place, Kai!\" Sir Trent growls.\n\n\n\"Fuck off, Trent, I\u0027m hungry!\" \n\n\n\"Kai!

It\u0027s at the edge of the Dwarven Clan\u0027s territory, so the Elves, Orcs and Men wouldn\u0027t head there, and the Dwarves are too scared shitless of going above ground for long enough to make the journey there.\"\n\n\n\"Good. I\u0027m certain that the Necromancer\u0027s daughter will have incur...?\"\n\n\n\"Who the fuck\u0027s the Orc?\" Kai interrupts.\n\n\n\"Dagden,\" you grunt in response.\n\n\n\"Can we trust him? Blondie, you want me to kill him?\"\n\n\n\"Yes we can trust him, and if you lay a hand on him I\u0027ll kill you... twice. Same if you call me Blondie.\"\n\n\nKai shrugs, and gets back to eating the corpses of the Golden Hand.\n\n\n\"As I was saying, the Necromancer\u0027s daughter having escaped will mean that they\u0027ll be men after you. Elves, most likely, they despise the undead, though men , the most numerous, could easily be encountered. Finally, there might be Orcs, those bastards are aggressive as hell and eager for war.

Dagden, is it?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"One of us will escort you and Dagden up to Kashin.

You eagerly dig in, devouring the sweet rolls and meats within a minute and quickly downing the ale. As you chew the last ounce of meat, you finish and begin watching Blaise as she eats. You find it strangely fascinating to watch another person eat. Blaise, as always to your surprise, devours the food with the ferocity of a Dragon. When she’s finished, you put away you food.

The community’s large enough that there’s always something new to do unlike back with Reaper Castle, and you begin to learn all of the town’s secrets. The hidden stash of hallucinogenic mushrooms that you learn belongs to old Mrs DeAngelo, the old scouting tunnels that were used to spy for enemies, the barred off Dwarven Mines that lead to a nesting ground for bats, even the secret room behind the school that’s being used as a distillery of a cheap knock off of Dwarven Mead. The heat for Blaise lasts for longer than expected, with some light patrols and even some wandering Heroes arriving in search for two refugees. Still, they’re easy to hide from with the help of Tholi. As time passes on you begin reading some of the many books that fills the great library that Tholi has collected over the years, with your interests including the making of a fine ale to the history of the Orcish Tribes off towards the cold, inhospitable Northern mountains. You practice with your weapons and Blood Magic everyday, and Blaise eagerly collects any bandit corpses or dying carcasses to bring back to life and train with, before eventually allowing them to depart from this realm once she’s finished. The time flies incredibly quickly. You wait patiently as fewer and fewer faces arrive looking for Blaise, and to a much lesser extent, you. The large WANTED: NECROMANCER posters that once plastered the town slowly give way to newer and more important issues, such as WANTED: BANDIT CHIEFTAIN or WANTED: FORGER as Blaise’s name fades from the headlines. As well as this, you can tell from Newspapers that the so called “Alliance” has fallen apart without a threat to unite against. Orc Raiders attack human communities, humans expand into Orc territory, the Dwarves stay as xenophobic and isolated as ever and tension flares within the Elves as the Wood Elves demand peace, the Dark Elves embark on business ventures and mercenary works for the enemies of the Elves and the High Elves try to expand their empire. This quickly leads to infighting, before the Alliance falls apart. Minor skirmishes break out as soldiers class along changing borders. Not only is the Alliance dead, it’s only a matter of time before wars break out. Still, this has little effect on the tiny community of Kashin, which continues to act as a home for the various Undead, Exiled and Scum of this plane.\n\n\n“Dagden! I need you to head out with Blaise to the market!” Tholi yells from across your stone home.\n\n\n“For what?” you reply with a shout.\n\n\n“There’s a new shipment of flowers, fertilisers and seeds. I need you to pick it up from Mr Tabernius. There’s coin and breakfast by the table. I’ve left some extra money for whatever you feel like doing, around 100 coins.”\n\n\nOf course it’s flowers and other gardening stuff. What else could it possibly be? Tholi is, quite ironically, a Plant and Life Mage. Blaise’s love of gardening, which again is incredibly ironic for a master of death, has only got them to get along better than ever. The massive greenhouse, which is one of the few buildings that goes above ground in Kashin, is an impressive thing to behold. Through magic, skill and a lot of hard work, she’s made an incredible and very impressive garden. From what you’ve heard, Tholi’s made quite a bit of coin selling impossible to find herbs to the Merchant Caravans. You clamber out of your bed and quickly get dressed in a rough woolen tunic, before walking downstairs. Blaise sits there, eating a bowl of grapes. A second, untouched bowl sits next to her, which you eagerly grab and begin to dig into. You toss one to Stitches, who lies on the ground off to the side, half-asleep. You shovel the plump purple grapes into your gob, as Tholi appears.\n\n\n“Good morning,\" she says cheerfully.\n\n\n“What flowers are coming in, Tholi?” Blaise asks eagerly.\n\n\n“Ah, there’s some Purple Dragon Tongue, Silver Bells, Sunshine Pitchers, Black Roses and some Daffodils, I think. You’d be surprised how hard it is to find good daffodils.”\n\n\n“Cool,\" Blaise says, pushing her empty bowl away. “Are you ready, Dag?”\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, your mouth full. You stand, pop on your boots, and begin heading out the door. Blaise grabs the bag of coins, and you walk with her. At this stage, you both know the town like the back of your hand. You pass the Grave, an Inn who’s primary market are the many undead who once served Dante and now hide, scared to lose their “lives” for a second time in their existence. You pass the Silver Chalice Tavern, Da’qiq’s General Store and several large stone homes build into the caves. You look up at the stone roof that would’ve plunged the cavern into darkness without the massive and numerous torches that covered the cavern walls and every building inside. You eventually find yourself at Mr Tibernius’ Master Store. The building is unoccupied nine months of the year as Mr Tibernius travels across the world and, according to some, visits other planes of existence, collecting everything from ornate candlesticks to dark tomes that speak the name of creatures that could burn this world to ash if they simply noticed it.\n","page 228":"“I… have come to take one of your teeth.”\n\n\nThe Dragon pauses, perhaps confused by this answer.\n\n\n“My teeth? Why? A dare, perhaps? An attempt at black magic?”\n\n\n“For a girl.”\n\n\nThe Dragon breaks into booming laughter, a horrible noise that makes you want to claw out your ears.\n\n\n“For a girl? I remember my days of mating past. I had entire Dwarven settlements wiped out and their treasure hoard stolen to be gifted to me by potential mates.\"\n\n\n“Well, I can’t do that.”\n\n\nThe Dragon stares at you, before it laughs again.\n\n\n“I’ll be honest, Orc, I’m nothing if not amused at this.

You shouldn\u0027t be. Go.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and quickly grab the dragon tooth and rush out of the cave. You quickly make your way down what is either a very large hill or a very small mountain.

The horse begins to gallop off towards the castle.\n","page 227":"You charge at it, jabbing your knife. You slash at its face, but your knife only scratches its scales.

Blaise mouths \"Tunnel\" to you before she turns away, and you nod. Thorin escorts you back to your room, locking the door behind you. Almost immediately, you head towards the bookshelf, pushing it out of the way to give you access to the tunnels inside. You do so, and walk into the darkness. You feel something run up your leg and you struggle not to scream, before realizing it\u0027s your new \"pet\" Mort. Mort sits on your shoulder, and you use all your inner strength to keep yourself from pushing him off.

As you enter the town hall, you see several new statues being pulled into place by multiple undead. The first shows a man standing on top of another, grinning. The second shows a man stuffing his face with food. The next shows a man in mid-battle, brutally beheading an Elf. The fourth shows a thief stealing a pouch of gold from another man. The fifth shows a woman glaring at a richer woman while seemingly pouring something into her drink. The sixth shows a man lying on top of a pile of cushions asleep. The last, quite surprisingly, shows a man and a woman in the middle of sex.\n\n\n\"Did you buy the six other statues to cover up the fact you really wanted porn?\" you ask, staring both impressed and disgusted with the beautiful chiseled testicles on the man in the last statue.\n\n\n\"I liked them. They\u0027re a set, for each of the main sins,\" Blaise says, walking on.\n\n\nYou notice a massive painting, featuring Blaise in her robes holding a skull in her hand.

As you near the end of the cave, you come across a horrific scene.\n\n\n\"Ah. There\u0027s been a battle,\" Sir Trent says.\n\n\nDozens of slain human corpses lie in a pile, surrounded by zombies. The zombies have abandoned all intelligence, and are eagerly chewing into the pile of corpses. As they spot you, they growl and begin stumbling towards you. Blaise screams and backs away, before you catch her. You raise an eyebrow, and she nods. She takes a deep breath, and begins to whisper to herself. The zombies stop heading towards you, and begin tearing each other apart. After a few seconds, the last one tears out it\u0027s own throat and falls to the ground. \n\n\n\"That was easy.\"\n\n\n\"Fighting undead\u0027s my specialty,\" Blaise shrugs.\n\n\n\"Wed better get on the road again.

There\u0027s a brief series of shouts as the various scouts and look-outs of the invading army notice the ghastly figures.\n\n\n\"Hey! Who goes there?\"\n\n\nOne of the Death Elementals cocks his head slightly, the ghastly smile of his skull becoming visible through his hood as it falls back slightly. There\u0027s a brief moment of silence as the Death Elementals stare at the soldiers who rush out of their tents, struggling to get dressed in their armor and grab weapons.\n\n\n\"Enemies of the Alliance will not stand before us? Drop your weapons or be destroyed.\"\n\n\nThe Death Elementals continue staring, almost amused at the predicament.\n\n\n\"Alright, let\u0027s send these creatures back to the void from whence they came! ATTACK!\"\n\n\nWith that cry, both sides burst into action. The soldiers start to rush forward, but the Death Elementals are much, much faster. They become blurs, charging forward with their scythes.They swing their blades with the skill and precision of creatures that had fought thousands of similar battles. There\u0027s a hundred terrified screams as the soldiers realize what they\u0027re fighting. You see flashes of steel followed by spurts of crimson as more soldiers drop. You see a trio of massive Orcs charge towards a Death Elemental and you briefly wonder if they\u0027ll take it down. Then, it strikes. The Death Elemental grabs the head of one of the orcs, knocking her sword out of the way and driving its boney fingers into the Orc\u0027s eye before grabbing her jaw as she screamed and tearing it off. It flings the jaw at the second Orc with such force that it shatters, filling the Orc with fragments of bone. As the second collapses backwards, the Death Elemental charges and punches the third with such force that it collapses the skull inward. It raises its scythe again, and resumes its killing. You watch as groups of unified soldiers are hacked apart before they can raise a shield in defense and massive, decorated warriors have their hearts ripped from their chests as they pitifully scream. The amount of carnage and death is astonishing. Entire regiments of soldiers are brutally murdered when the Death Elementals direct their attention towards them, soldiers are sliced apart before they can get out of their tents and limbs, heads and torsos fly through the air do to the massive force behind each swing of the scythe. Eventually, the carnage ends. A blood mist arises as you\u0027re left looking out on a massive scene of death and carnage. Thousands of bodies lie mutilated and twisted among the tents that have been destroyed, with an ocean of blood pooling beneath them. The only things left standing are the nine hooded skeletons that stand with scythes in their hands staring at what they\u0027ve created, or more accurately, what they\u0027ve destroyed.\n\n\n\"What the fuck...?\" you ask, in complete shock and terror.\n\n\nThe nine Death Elementals convene at the gates, staring at you. You go to draw your sword again, but Blaise stops you.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t.\"\n\n\n\"Fine,\" you say.\n\n\nThe nine Death Elementals stare at you for a few minutes, before the black, sulfurous smoke begins to be emitted from under their cloaks and you begin to cough as your vision\u0027s obscured. The smoke clears after a minute of coughing, and they\u0027re all gone. \n\n\n\"What the fuck just happened?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We witnessed the powers of death,\" Blaise whispers.\n\n\nYou stare at the massive army, thousands strong, now lying in front of you.\n\n\n\"Can we... well, you... raise them up?\"\n\n\nBlaise nods.\n\n\n\"We are now in possession of the largest army in existence.

You almost cry out in fear when you realize that its a an undead monster. It seems to be a zombie, although you\u0027ve no idea. You\u0027ve never had undead this far, and the sight of one is terrifying. You see Bagig awaken out of the corner of your eye, with a similar cloaked undead monster above him.

The zombie yanks you forward, and quite gently lays you on the ground. You open your eyes slightly, to see you\u0027re being laid out in rows. You\u0027re in the courtyard of what appears to be a massive castle made from black stone. You\u0027re surrounded by undead monsters, with one exception: A human, wearing hooded black robes, holding a steel sword. His face is paler than bone, and his angular facial features tells you there\u0027s probably some High Elf lineage in him. His black hair is slicked back undead his hood, and he eagerly looks at the corpses like a warrior among battle. An undead knight who had been leading the pack rides forward, looking at the man.\n\n\n\"Are you raising them, or is the Grand Necromancer?\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer. Papa\u0027s told you about him. A cowardly mage who uses raises the dead to fight for him.

The Grim Reaper shall not take you today! Shrug off the eternal sleep and wake!\" he laughs.\n\n\nHis eyes turn black as his pupils consume his irises and corneas. A faint blackness appears to flow from his fingertips outwards, enrapturing the corpses. The corpses begin to shudder as the black, magical energy floods into them. Then, the dead begin to rise. Slowly, the corpses begin to stand, their eyes still as soulless as before. The Necromancer pauses, spotting you. You attempt to stand slowly, like the newly created zombies, but stumble and fall flat again.\n\n\n\"Ah, someone from the land of the living is here! Hello!\"\n\n\nCold hands grab you, and you are yanked up. You crane your neck to see Bagig, holding you in his rotting hands. No, Bagig is dead. Bagig was loving, friendly, funny and kind. This... abomination, has black, soulless eyes. You draw your blade and sink it into the side of his head. Bagig\u0027s corpse releases you, and falls to the ground. Bagig has always loved you. His body deserves to rest.\n\n\n\"Ah, a fighter!\" the Necromancer laughs.\n\n\nRotting hands grab you, and the knife is ripped from your hands. You see several Orcs, seemingly alive, approach.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s the issue, Trant?\" one of them growls.\n\n\n\"My title is Necromancer Trant, servant of the Grand Necromancer.

He\u0027s quite a fair bit taller than Bagig was, although his body is covered with scars. Several scars run across his face, including one that\u0027s taken out his eye, leaving a disgusting hole in his face.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s just a boy.

You fall on the ground, and he grabs your arms. You watch with terror as a chopping block is brought out. One of the Orcs binds your hands with ropes, tightening them behind your back. You\u0027re shoved to your knees, and the chopping block is dropped in front of you. Your neck is forced to the chopping block. A bucket is shoved in front of you, no doubt for your head to fall into. The Mercenary Leader is handed a massive battleaxe. \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, kid. I\u0027ll make it quick.

The one in the lead is a tall, pale figure wearing hooded black robes with silver trim with short black hair. His face is gaunt and his eyes are sunken into his face, giving him the appearance of a skull. He is followed by a small girl, who looks to be only your age, wearing a dark red dress with flowing blond hair. She\u0027s considerably less pale than the man, and has bright green eyes. She looks worried at the sight of the execution, and she very well might\u0027ve just saved your life.\n\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" the tall man asks angrily.\n\n\n\"Nothing, Grand Necromancer.\"\n\n\n\"Nothing?

Well, not kids specifically, but my job is to kill whoever...\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer, despite being quite short, swings his fist, punching the Mercenary Leader.\n\n\n\"If you pull this shit again, I\u0027ll torture you to death, and then do it again!\" the Grand Necromancer says.\n\n\n\"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir,\" the Orc apologizes.\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer looks at you, before looking at the girl.\n\n\n\"Cut the boy loose, have his wounds dressed and have him cleaned and clothed.\"\n\n\n\"Then what?\" the Orc asks.\n\n\n\"Have him brought to my quarters.\"\n\n\nThe Orc nods. The Necromancer looks at you.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s your name, boy?\"\n\n\n\"Dagden.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s alright, Dagden. I promise you won\u0027t be harmed. I have problems to deal with, Balok. Don\u0027t cause more of them.\"\n\n\nHe turns, and strolls off. The girl stays behind for a few seconds, staring at you. Finally, she turns and quickly follows the Grand Necromancer.\n\n\n\"Well, fuck me,\" Balok sighs, cutting you loose. \"Come on, you little prick. I gotta follow the \"Master of Death\"\u0027s orders. And way to stand up for me, Trant. Fuck you, you fuckin\u0027 corpse-fucker.\"\n\n\nTrant smiles and gives Balok the finger.

You\u0027re eventually led to a pair of double doors.\n\n\n\"Through there,\" the Wight says.\n","page 56":"Chapter II: A Guest among the Graves\n\n\nYou push through the double doors, and find yourself in a large room. A massive feasting table stands in front of you, covered in food. Your stomach grumbles as you realize you haven\u0027t eaten in quite some time, and your mouth waters as you look upon roasted chicken, baked loaves of bread, turkey legs, roasted boar and even more food. You see the Grand Necromancer sitting at the head of the table, wearing his black robes with the silver trim, although his hood is pulled down. Sitting next to him is the young child from earlier. About a dozen black robed Necromancers sit at the table, as well as several Mercenary Captains. Standing guard are dozens of undead knights, who stare at you with their cold eyes. The Grand Necromancer looks up at you and smiles.\n\n\n\"Ah! Our guest is here, young Mr Dagden. Please, take a seat at my side.\"\n\n\nYou can tell by the cold, emotionless staring of the guards that declining this offer would be a bad move. You nod, and walk past the necromancers. You spot Trant among them, who winks at you. You make a silent promise to yourself that you\u0027re going to kill him. You take a seat next to the Grand Necromancer, directly across from the girl. The Grand Necromancer smiles at you, a charming smile from a horrible monster of a man.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry about the recent unpleasantness, Dagden. I sent my soldiers to wipe out bandits and thugs and retrieve their corpses to add to my forces. I\u0027m so sorry that you and your brother got confused with them.\"\n\n\nYou don\u0027t look at the Grand Necromancer, out of disgust and hatred. You grab a turkey leg, and eagerly begin chewing into it. You realize just how starved you are as begin to wolf down your meal.\n\n\n\"Hungry little one, aren\u0027t you? I bet you\u0027ve never eaten a meal this big, coming from a tribal village.\"\n\n\n\"I bet you didn\u0027t catch a single thing on this table yourself, and got stronger men to do it,\" you retort. \n\n\nThe Necromancer laughs.\n\n\n\"It tastes better that way, I would imagine. I admit, I don\u0027t catch my own food. I\u0027m not a strong person. My brothers were the strong ones. They wanted to be warriors. I wanted to be a scholar, but after I began to research magic, I decided to become a mage. I quickly specialized in Necromancy. It has a terrible reputation like all other forms of Black Magic, but I\u0027ve never understood it. Necromancy, Blood Magic, Creating Life, Elemental Darkness, Demon Summoning, Demon Bonding, deals with demons... Anything with demons, really, all hated by fools and morons. We hate Blood Magic because we can\u0027t seem to comprehend a need for sacrifice, we hate creating life because we seem to think that\u0027s the place of the Gods who barely exist and never help us \"foolish mortals\", we hate Elemental Darkness because the dumbest part of our brain is scared of what we can\u0027t see, we hate dealing with demons because we\u0027re too scared about our ability to keep control over them, and most importantly, we hate Necromancy because we have respect for corpses because of what they once were and fear the dead. It\u0027s pathetic. Do you know the amount of good Necromancy could do? Imagine cities defended by armies of undead, so hunting bandits and defending from enemies will no longer risk any lives. Do you see why my work is important?\"\n","page 59":"You sprint towards the gate, running as fast as you can. The undead notice, and a few of them draw their bows.

It moves slightly, revealing a small wooden door hidden behind it. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s a pretty obvious place to put a hidden door. I don\u0027t think this castle\u0027s architect was very clever.\"\n\n\nShe unlocks and opens the door.

You push the bookshelf closed, before you hear a short rapping on the door. Blaise opens it, and you\u0027re faced with the Dwarven Wight from earlier.\n\n\n\"Lady Blaise, Dagden.

Of course, if I think the request compromises the... security of you or anyone else here, I shall not grant it.\"\n\n\nYou nod, looking up at him. His rotting face stares blankly on, before he stops in front of a large oak door. He opens it, and you walk inside. There\u0027s a small room with a seat with a hole in the floor that you presume is a bathroom, a basin filled with water, a small bed, a wardrobe, a dresser, a bookshelf and a table and chair.There\u0027s also a massive bear skull mounted on the wall, which you think looks cool.\n\n\n\"This shall be your quarters for the duration of your stay. I shall guard the door for the night. Knock on the door if you need anything.\"\n\n\nWith that, Thorin closes the door. You can hear the clunking of the locking mechanism, and then silence. You look around. There\u0027s a book lying on the table that might be of some interest, and there\u0027s also the bed, which after such a long day looks quite appealing.\n","page 361":"Eternal Sleep\n\n\nYour life force is taken from you as you enter the endless sleep of death.\n","page 360":"You charge into Blaise\u0027s room.

The Knights repaired three destroyed Steel Skull Vessels and used them to launch raids against the pirating-fishing communities all along the coasts, before eventually crippling their operations all along the coast. These men turned their newly made fleet into the Royal Navy. The Navy first assured the continent was conquered by the Emperor, although they failed to conquer the Forests of the North due to the Elves, the Mountains of the South due to Dwarves, and the Hills and Mountains of the West due to the Orcs. They did manage to conquer all the way to the East, where they crossed the Great Sea, where they Royal Navy was essential in conquering both the coasts of the Lands of the East Men and the coasts of the Lands of Desert Men, although these invasions proved disastrous as the battles went inland, and the Royal Army got their ass handed to them.

Eventually, they were exposed as vampires after a Vampire Hunter used sunlight to hurt them. They then brutally fought to hold their power, and failed.

The first few pages detail simple, boring childhood games like Hopscotch, Hide and Seek, Tag and Stuck in the Mud. Then, it gets weirder.\n\n\nDragon Breath\n\n\nFirst, you need to get at least one friend, a torch. Go to a random house in the middle of the night, and use the torch to set the house on fire. Then, run through the house, entering through the front door and going out through the backdoor or a window. Then, have your friend run through the house. Take turns running through the house. Whoever fails to get through the house loses. If anyone refuses to go through out of fear, they\u0027re a chicken, and you know what to do with Chickens: Cook them! \n\n\nCalling Friends\n\n\nFirst, you need to get an iron blade, twenty stones taken from a riverbed, firewood, the son of a religious preacher and an amulet, necklace or brooch taken from a mother who died during labor. Affix the piece of jewelry to the son. Make a large platform out of firewood, and make a Cyrziachian Circle out of the stones. Place the son in the middle of the circle, and set the firewood alight. If the son tries to escape the flames, slash him with the knife. Ideally, have friends gather around the circle and slash him whenever he tries to get out. Once the son has fallen to the flames, wait. After the body has been consumed by ash, you should have a new friend to play with in the center of the flames.\n\n\nYou close the book, and put it back.

I don\u0027t know what they did to me. They hurt me, and then I became cold. I\u0027m so so cold. I couldn\u0027t even pick up the quill. It kept... falling through my hands. I managed after a while. This journal is all I have. It\u0027s all I have. I\u0027m so scared. I\u0027m scared by the men, and my family who aren\u0027t going to wake up, but I\u0027m most scared of the other body.

You go to take all the keys off, before thinking and deciding to only slide the library key off, which you recognize by the ominous black book on it. You briefly wonder if this is a trap because it seems too easy, but slide the key off with ease. Thorin picks up the platter, and puts it on the table.\n\n\n\"Sorry, Thorin,\" Blaise says.\n\n\n\"Oh, no problem at all, Lady Blaise. Shall I get you another meal?\"\n\n\n\"No thanks. I\u0027m full.

Rows of books fill the library, including any category from tragedy to comedy to history to pastoral to pastoral-comical to historical-pastoral to tragical-historical to tragical-comical-historical to one-act plays to long poems. At the end of the library, enclosed behind an iron gate, is the forbidden section. You walk over, and unlock the door.

Anyone alive could go to an Ant Hill, and drop crumbs to Chosen Ants and crush the Cursed Ants. This person would be a God to the Ants. Perhaps the Gods we observe are just the weaker, dumber, more arrogant beings who concern themselves with our affairs like an Elf who spends his time playing with Ants. What about the Gods who are more powerful? What about the so called all powerful, benevolent, omnipresent and omniscient God many claim exist? Well than I ask you, why worship him? The world must be perfect in the eyes of the new, all-powerful being or he would\u0027ve changed the world to fit his standards. Hence, unless you think the world is perfect, your view is different to the all-powerful being, and hence you shouldn\u0027t bother to follow him. Unless you decide to follow this being because he\u0027s the most powerful and hence his beliefs are right, you\u0027re simply appealing to authority, like a soldier saying it\u0027s alright to kill children because the most powerful King ordered him to do so. Hence, I have come to find the belief that we should become our own Gods. We should perform any ritual, learn any magic to become closer to all-powerful Gods above all others.\n\n\nAt this point, you get bored, and put down the book.

You turn the page, only to find almost the exact same story. Marion was a young fishmonger who couldn\u0027t find a husband, before finding the book and being teleported to the dark place to end up as an eternal wanderer searching for freedom. You turn the page, and see the same story again with a different person. You want to put down the book, but you simply can\u0027t. Something\u0027s forcing you to continue reading. You reach the final page, and let out a scream as you see the title: Dagden.\n","page 186":"You struggle to open the book through the crusty pages, which are mostly obscured by the disgusting liquids and stains that cover them.

You shrug. You sit down in a wooden chair, and watch as the conversation continues.

It has sharp, dark green thorns curving upwards coming from the stem, and beautiful black petals forming an intricate cupping shape, with a beautiful blood red pistil. Light reddish brown pollen gently lifts from the anthers into the air around it, carrying a scent like cooked meat, which is odd for a flower.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s...\" Tholi begins.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s your Death\u0027s Head Flower!

His head sits in his lap, a bloody iron crown with nine black gems built into it resting on his head.

It’s a shithole, a refuge for bandits and scum. After the war against your father, there was the awkward question of who would take Reaper Castle. All of the Alliance had some claim on it, whether it be because it’s closest to their territory, or they led the charge, or they killed the Necromancer or lost the most men. Since parts of the Dead Empire were given to all who fought and none could agree on who to give Reaper Castle to, they simply left it abandoned. Still, in this recent time of friction they each have large forces nearby, ready to take Reaper Castle in the event of war or another race trying to capture it. The Castle itself should still be structurally sound and mostly fine, it’s only been two years. Still, between the various bandits staying there, the few undead that were left behind and have no doubt gone feral and any other scum that’s taken up residence there, it will be some effort to take back,” Sir Trent says.\n\n\n“We can do it,” Blaise says, looking uncertain.\n\n\n“Yeah, we will,\" you reply.\n\n\n“You two better get some sleep. The sun’s falling, and we won’t be there for a few days.

Still, the Alliance\u0027s destruction does little to you. The Elf-Man War that\u0027s went on for many years on and off continues, but doesn\u0027t effect you.

At first, a few of the most recently buried burst from the ground and stand at attention. This number rises, and after a few minutes, over a hundred new undead soldiers.\n\n\n“We’re missing the leaders,” Blaise says.\n\n\n“Who?” you ask.\n\n\n“These are all plain undead. There should be a Revenant to lead the undead from Jarrow. Where is it, Lady Eli?”\n\n\n“The Alliance planned to wipe out any Revenant bodies that could be found.

The thing about…”\n\n\n“We got ‘em!” someone shouts.\n\n\nYou turn to see several coffins being hoisted from the ground. The first is opened, revealing a massive, rotting body of a woman. The second reveals a particularly large dwarf, the next two both large, bearded men, the fifth a tall, lean Half-Orc and, to your surprise, the last coffin is a tiny body wrapped in a shroud. For a second you think it’s a dwarf, before you realize it’s actually a young human child. Blaise walks to the side of a coffin and stands still for a second, black magic flowing from her. Then, the large woman stands with a growl. She does the same with the next coffin, and the next, before after repeating it several more times. Once the small child stands, there’s a brief moment of silence as the six stand there, stretching and coughing as air enters their dusty lungs for the first time in two years.\n\n\n“So… you’re the new necromancer, eh?” the large woman asks. “I remember you. The old guy’s daughter.”\n\n\n“I’m hungry,” the half-orc grunts. “Who has food?”\n\n\nSomeone throws the half-orc a piece of cooked meat, which he eagerly chews into.\n\n\n“Where am I?” the child asks, looking around.\n\n\n“Alright, listen up!” Blaise says loudly. “I am Lady Blaise, the Grand Necromancer!

Jarrow is one of the larger towns in close proximity of Reaper Castle, and one of the most loyal. Only the towns of Danton, Deadwoods and Haversham were more loyal to the Grand Necromancer, and Danton and Deadwoods were destroyed by the Alliance during the fall of the Dead Empire, and Haversham is far too small to hold what Blaise has planned.\n\n\n\"Why the hell are we on rotting horses? There were alive horses from the bandits.\"\n\n\n\"Looks cooler.

Child, how do you know we can trust these peasants?\" Soren and Malign say.\n\n\n\"We don\u0027t,\" Blaise says. \"The plan\u0027s simple.

We convince them to join us, or we make sure they know the future consequences.\"\n\n\n\"And if they attempt to turn us in to the Alliance?\" Sir Trent asks.\n\n\n\"I doubt they will.

Tied to the top of each stake are men and women, stripped down to their undergarments. Thankfully, they all appear to be dead, most having their throats slit or having been stabbed through the chest.\n\n\n\"Huh. I\u0027m impressed,\" Blaise says. \"I guess they probably will side with us.\"\n\n\n\"This is barbaric! These monsters have massacred soldiers! There are children there, boys little over sixteen years of age!\"\n\n\n\"Girls as young as nine were raped in the destruction of Danton. Pregnant mothers were stabbed with spears. Don\u0027t lecture us on morality, Paladin,\" Sir Trent says.\n\n\n\"No... the Alliance wouldn\u0027t do that. You\u0027re mistaken! You\u0027re lying! You\u0027re...! You\u0027re probably right.

Black pants, polished boots, a white shirt, a blue and golden jacket and a buckled fur cloak. You put them on, and realize quickly you look like a twat. Still, today\u0027s the day of the Ceremony of the Pledging, so you assume you\u0027re supposed to look like a twat like all the other important people coming here. You walk outside of your room, and Thorin\u0027s waiting for you.\n\n\n\"Dagden, you and Lady Blaise have been requested to have breakfast away from the head of the main feasting table.\"\n\n\n\"Why?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"You will have dinner with the other children.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m thirteen, I\u0027m not a child.\"\n\n\nThorin shrugs.\n\n\n\"What do you even mean, other children?\"\n\n\n\"Many of the various Necromancers, Mercenary Captains, Lords, Ladies, Mayors and Politicians who hold positions of power among the Grand Necromancer\u0027s empire have brought their sons and daughters here.

Weird feelings go through your body as you see her. She\u0027s wearing a long, deep crimson dress with a beige cloak over it. You feel a pang of joy when you see her dragon tooth necklace displayed proudly.\n\n\n\"Hi, Dag.\"\n\n\n\"Hey. How\u0027d you sleep?\"\n\n\n\"Good, thanks. Are you excited to see the new guests?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I can\u0027t wait.\"\n\n\nThorin leads you into the main hall, where an additional \"children\u0027s\" table has been set up. About a dozen children, ranging from Humans to Elves to Orcs to Dwarves sit at the table already, with two places at the head for you and Blaise. You take your seat next to Blaise and stare at them.\n\n\n\"Hello. I\u0027m Blaise,\" Blaise says cheerfully. \"And this is Dagden.\"\n\n\n\"Dagden what?\" one of the Orc children ask. \"What\u0027s your title?\"\n\n\nYou wince, realizing your lack of contact with other Orcs means that you\u0027ve yet to receive a title, meaning you still have the childhood title of Youngblood. You suppose Bearbane could be used, but the only one\u0027s who gave you that nickname died without telling anyone of your feat, so you have no witnesses to it and hence the title\u0027s invalid.\n\n\n\"Dagden Dragontooth.\"\n\n\nHuh. She was a lot quicker at bullshitting than you. Impressive.\n\n\n\"How\u0027d he earn that nickname?\"\n\n\n\"He stole a tooth from a dragon,\" Blaise says, and she smiles at you.\n\n\nThe Orc nods in respect, and you feel pride.

Humanoid creatures fought demons and some had pointy ears or green skin and raised the dead. I traveled with a show for a while, peering at the world while they peered at my freaks. Then I visited a few stores that sold items that I created to see what they do with it. I\u0027m tired of it, now. I\u0027m bored of watching what your world has to offer, and I\u0027m going to move on. Time to explore the next world.

OK, I\u0027m ready.\"\n\n\nThe door unlocks and swings open, and Blaise steps out. Her long hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and she\u0027s wearing a flowing black dress. She wears dark eye shadow, and dark red lipstick. She smiles at you.\n\n\n\"How do I look?\"\n\n\n\"Is pretty or scary what you were going for?\"\n\n\n\"A bit of both,\" Blaise says.\n\n\n\"Well, you\u0027ll definitely impress the villagers,\" you say.\n\n\n\"If you like this, you\u0027ll love your outfit.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not wearing an outfit.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, you are.\"\n\n\n\"If you try to put me in an outfit, I swear I\u0027ll burn this place down.\"\n\n\n\"You Orcs are so violent.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m pretty passive.

Inside, standing on an armor rack, is a large suit of black metal armor. Two skulls are mounted on the suit, one on each shoulder, and several short, small spikes emerge from the metal plates.\n\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\n\"Where\u0027d you find this stuff?\"\n\n\n\"The dress was my mom\u0027s. No one must have found it during the looting. The armor was in one of the abandoned rooms.

The corpses are dragged out, the bloodstains cleaned and the walls repaired to what extent can be done.\n\n\n“Do you like it?” Blaise asks as a team of undead finish repairing the gates.\n\n\n“It’s missing a lot of its decorative features.”\n\n\n“I’ll get them back. We need to start expanding first. There’s a few hidden stockpiles of Dad’s gold that the bastard raiding Alliance soldiers didn’t find.

Mr Nilvos might be, but I have no idea about the Elf-Orc-Demon Thing.”\n\n\nYou nod, and go talk to them. You wander along the halls to Mr Nilvos’ room. You find him sprawled out on his bed, a bottle of whiskey in his hand.\n\n\n“Ah, Greenskin.

Plus, I don’t know if you heard, but I’ve nowhere else to go.”\n\n\nYou nod, and leave Mr Nilvos’ in his night of drinking. You walk along the halls to Soren’s location. Room isn’t the right word, but it’s certainly his. He sits kneeling in an empty room, praying.\n\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n\n“Praying. The True Power will guide me through this time of strife.”\n\n\n\"What the fuck is the True Power?\"\n\n\n\"The True power is the one true God I have pledged to, the True Power. He will guide me. If I stay true to his ways, I shall make it through this.\"\n\n\n“Soren, why are you still here?”\n\n\n“Fear… Can you not smell it, boy? He’s practically pissing himself. He knows any sin he commits will give me more control. Isn’t it ironic that because he decided to forsake freedom and joy to follow the Gods and pray, he’s now had all freedom and happiness taken from him? I don’t believe we’ve been introduced. I am Malign.”\n\n\n\"I\u0027m Dagden.”\n\n\n“Stop conversing with it, for fuck’s sake! I… It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve yet to talk to the Dead Girl, but she seems like a valiant leader.”\n\n\n“She’s not dead.”\n\n\n“Not completely. But you don’t steal from Death without him noticing. Give it time, and death will reclaim what was once his… Perhaps. Perhaps the girl will win. I must admit, I am quite fascinated by the fight. I wonder where you two will end up. A grave? A throne? A more… interesting place? In all honesty, I’m quite happy to accompany and … advise the girl. I’ve always had a thing for mortals. Not in the way you\u0027re thinking, pervert. I\u0027ll leave you to that front.”\n\n\n“Alright, then. So you’re on our side?”\n\n\n“I’m so tired. It’s claws grip into my mind… I...”\n\n\n“Why haven’t you left? You’re a Paladin. You should’ve left here by now, taking everyone’s head.”\n\n\nSoren shakes his head.\n\n\n“No… I don’t think that the Necromancers can be wiped out. By forcing Necromancy into the darkness with cursed magic like Infernal Dealings, we’ve only made it worse. So perhaps I will try bring Necromancy back in with the good arts.

Thorin, for instance. They\u0027re usually made from trusted allies to command groups of zombies. Then there are the animals.

Where would you like to go, Dagden?\"\n","page 349":"You quickly begin packing your things.

When you reach the top, you find yourself at the top of the castle walls. You look out at the surrounding land, seeing only fields, a small portion of which has been turned to farmland. You spot the robed Grand Necromancer standing next to Blaise, and Thorin leads you to him. \n\n\n\"Ah, Dag. It\u0027s a pleasure to see you. How\u0027d you sleep?\"\n\n\n\"Good. Why am I here?\" you grunt in response, glaring at the Grand Necromancer.\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer smiles, either not noticing or not caring, or perhaps pretending not to notice or care.\n\n\n\"My daughter seems quite infatuated with you after last night, though I only left you only for about ten minutes. She asked me to let you come.\"\n\n\nBlaise blushes shyly, and the Grand Necromancer laughs.\n\n\n\"Thorin, you\u0027re dismissed. Dagden, as I was just telling my daughter, I think you should both know what my undead army is made of.\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer sweeps his hand across the courtyard, where an undead army is assembling. \n\n\n\"How much do you know of the Undead, Dagden?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m a kid who grew up in an Orc village. What do you think?\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer chuckles.\n\n\n\"Fair point. The average member of the undead is the Zombie, a simple corpse raised with Necromantic power with little sentience and little independence. Some are full rotting corpses while some are skeletons, with the powers of death being the only thing keeping the bones from falling apart.\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer points down to a rotting soldier armored in chain mail holding a sword and shield.\n\n\n\"Then there\u0027s the Spirits. Spirits are the souls of beings that remained on this plane long after their time on this plane has ended. With my help, they can materialize and are able to fight.\"\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer points down to a vaguely see-through, spectral figure. The figure is tinted a bluish-green, and you stare through it for a few seconds.\n\n\n\"Then there\u0027s the Wights. Almost indistinguishable from Zombies, though far more powerful. Dying men can be turned into them, their souls trappe... kept within their body at the time of death, keeping their intelligence and soul in their body, although it will still rot as others. Thorin, for instance. They\u0027re usually made from trusted allies to command groups of zombies. Then there are the animals. Animals are hard to keep control of, and some such as wolves and bears would be incredibly rebellious. Still, dogs such as Stitches and undead or even skeletal horses ridden by my calvary. There\u0027s also Liches?\"\n\n\n\"Like you?\" Blaise asks.\n\n\n\"No, no, I\u0027m just a Necromancer. A Lich is a Necromancer who turns himself into an undead being. They\u0027re immensely powerful and immortal. Someday, I hope to become one to look over my new world for centuries. I digress. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve shown you my Revenants or my Flesh Monstrosities. Revenants are powerful undead beings made through summoning the Spirit of a powerful being and binding it back to their bodies, although with extra work souls can be bound to other bodies. These beings are some of the most powerful undead. I only have a handful. Finally, there\u0027s the Flesh Monstrosities. You\u0027ll love it.\"\n\n\nA  massive, lumbering beast the size of three men in both height and width steps forward. It looks like a doll stuffed with meat. It looks like a child\u0027s pathetic attempt at drawing a human, and has a giant gaping mouth, massive bulging muscles that allow it to hold the massive sword it\u0027s holding.\n\n\n\"That is a Flesh Monstrosity. It\u0027s made by doctors under my personal supervision, stitched together from other corpses. It\u0027s an entirely new creature with a newly created soul. They\u0027re slow and dumb, but their strength, size and endurance makes them fantastic on the battlefield. That\u0027s pretty much everything in my army. Did you enjoy the tour?\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you,\" you grunt.\n\n\nThe Grand Necromancer sighs.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re not being very polite, you know that?\"\n\n\n\"Necromancer Trant ordered my brother\u0027s death, and Balok the Honorless tried to kill me.

Sadly, both Necromancer Trant and Balok the Honorless have yet to be killed in battle. Then again, this means they\u0027ll be alive for when you kill them. Although your initial anger and rage towards them has faded, you know as an Orc it\u0027s your duty and responsibility to get revenge for Bagig. This has clearly been hurting Blaise emotionally, as she\u0027s been acting sadder and spending more time in her room lately. Finally, you decide to talk to Thorin.\n\n\n\"Is she usually this sad when her dad goes?\" Thorin asks.\n\n\n\"Sometimes, especially around holidays.

Why did I start that? Long story short, he founded a small kingdom, he jumped into a volcano to prove his divinity, he died and the kingdom he founded eventually became the Kingdom of Man. He wasn\u0027t even one of the madder kings, except for thinking he was a god. You want crazy? King Stevens. Imported animals from across the world, all to have sex with. Made the Royal Zoo, a massive attraction today. Still, so much animal sex, all while drinking shots of dragon urine. Shall we learn about King Stevens? No, he\u0027s also quite boring. I mean, besides the animal sex and drinking of dragon urine, his reign was filled with some of the most boring events ever. The Registration of the Dark Mages. Not a war with them, not a battle, a registration. The Tariff on Fish. Salt Mines! God, it\u0027s boring. What do you want to learn about?\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t mind,\" Blaise replies.\n\n\n\"Orc boy? What do you want to learn about? Something not shitty, preferably.

In death, your body will be raised again to protect your family, and if you wish, your soul may stay as well. There will be no corruption in me, for once I embrace undeath and become a Lich, I will have no need for physical pleasure, I will live on through death to carve this empire and keep it going for an infinite number of generations. We will have the perfect world. The homeless will be housed, the sick healed and the starving fed. The dead will be risen! We fight for the perfect world! Our Empire will become the envy of the living, the dead and the Gods! We will create the perfect world!

Today you have pledged yourselves to my empire. We will build a better world. Through the Path of Death, we will create a new world of life. With one leader, we won\u0027t need war. With an army of undead, we won\u0027t need town guards to hunt down criminals and risk their lives. To protect us from threats we\u0027ll have an army that requires no food or rest. You children, your sons and daughters, will not be sent out to fight and die. In pledging to me, you\u0027ve pledged to have your children protected! In death, your body will be raised again to protect your family, and if you wish, your soul may stay as well. There will be no corruption in me, for once I embrace undeath and become a Lich, I will have no need for physical pleasure, I will live on through death to carve this empire and keep it going for an infinite number of generations. We will have the perfect world. The homeless will be housed, the sick healed and the starving fed. The dead will be risen! We fight for the perfect world! Our Empire will become the envy of the living, the dead and the Gods! We will create the perfect world! An end to poverty, an end to starvation, at end to racism, at end to sexism, an end to suffering, an end to death! You have joined me, and I swear, the Reaper will take me from to the grave before I let that vision crumble! Follow me past the obstacles of death and the enemy! We will create the new world!

Curse the Gods, this isn\u0027t going as well as I had planned. Are there any servants even left? Oh, here\u0027s a few.

I liked it.\"\n\n\n\"Good. I hope he gets to achieve his dreams of the perfect world, though I am realizing I\u0027m not really the heir to his throne if he does become immortal.\"\n\n\n\"Well, maybe we could have a military coup.\"\n\n\n\"Sure,\" Blaise laughs. \"I\u0027ll be Queen Blaise, and you can be my king.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, don\u0027t thank me.

I died back when I was sixteen. I was a farmer when Elves invaded and attacked my father. I took his spear, and joined the battle against the elves. I was in battle, and they told me to kill the Elf Captain, so I did. Then I killed a few more elves and the town said I was a hero. I spent the next two years fighting elves before I had my drink poisoned.\"\n\n\n\"You killed an Elf captain when you were fourteen?\"\n\n\nLucas nods, and Blaise walks over.\n\n\n\"Hello, M\u0027Lady. I am Lucas.\"\n\n\n\"Hello, Lucas. I am the new Grand Necromancer.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve noticed. You\u0027re quite beautiful, if I may so myself. Are you involved?\"\n\n\n\"I happen to be \"involved\" with this gorgeous green monstrosity,\" she says, patting you on the back.\n\n\n\"A pity,\" Lucas sighs, before turning and walking off.\n\n\nBlaise finishes swearing in the Revenants and giving them their orders, and turns back to you.\n\n\n\"OK, I\u0027m ready. Let\u0027s head home.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and walk off, back to your steed.\n","page 338":"As you dream, voices begin to break through the dream and scratch against your mind.\n\n\n\"Kill him.\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s just a boy.\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s old enough.
