  "Take control of Dagden, a small Orc child taken from his family and taken prisoner in Reaper Castle under the control of the Grand Necromancer, before making friends with his daughter Blaise and choosing how to make your mark in the world.\nThis is my spin-off to Mazkil, except better, longer and with more things you like and less things you don\u0027t like, whatever they may be. Somehow, I\u0027ve appealed to everyone! I\u0027d like to thank the OKish Mizal for beta-reading and helping me sort through the earlier version of this storygame and make it somewhat readable, she was a fantastic help. Please rate, comment and tell me if you find any bugs. Thanks, and enjoy!"
