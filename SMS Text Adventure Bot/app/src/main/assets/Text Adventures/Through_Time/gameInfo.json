  "You play as Jacob, a 28 year old man who has gone nowhere in life. Suddenly, you wake up to find yourself 10 years in the past. Once there, you meet several people who seem to recognize you, but you can\u0027t seem to remember them at all. Is your life the only one that went wrong? What really happened in your past?\nThis storygame plays out like a visual novel, with a unique route for each main character, and a true route. Replaying it more than once is highly recommended to get the full experience.\nI also recommend you complete all the good routes before going for the true end, as it ties everything else together.\nHow to load a saved file:\nGo to http://chooseyourstory.com/My/Saves.aspx\nClick restore beside the save titled \"Through Time\"\n(You must be logged in, and have a saved file for this to work)\nHow to interpret your score:\n(Max score) 97531  - You completed every route possible.\nScore has a 9 - You completed the true end.\nScore has a 7 - You completed Olivia\u0027s good end.\nScore has a 5 - You completed Ian\u0027s good end.\nScore has a 3 - You completed Tina\u0027s good end.\nScore has a 1 - You completed Allison\u0027s good end.\nThe actual \"score\", doesn\u0027t matter, just these numbers.\n\nSpecial Thanks:\nKiel_Farren - For editing and grammar\nTanstaafl - For editing and grammar\nComplete Walkthrough (should you require it): Link"
