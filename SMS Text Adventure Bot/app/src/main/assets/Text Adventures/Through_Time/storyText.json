{"page 123":"\"Let\u0027s go eat some food.\"\n\nYou tell Allison.\n\n\n\nThe food from the fair is exactly as you would have expected it to be. It\u0027s expensive, high in fat and sugars, and wildly mediocre in taste at best. However the two of you manage to enjoy some nachos together, and afterwards some cotton candy. During the week Allison had told you that she loved cotton candy, so you made sure to get some for the two of you. You had separate ones of course, but it made you happy to see her happy.\n\nCome to think of it, when was the last time you felt this way? After high school you had simply followed Ian into the supermarket, a decision that didn\u0027t have much thought or effort behind it. Then again, you never had the ambition to do anything anyway, so you were content. At least, you thought you were.\n\n\"This is sooo good!\"\n\nAllison practically squeals in delight while eating her cotton candy.\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nShe says, stuffing some of her partly eaten cotton candy into your mouth. Embarrassed, you eat it, to which she smirks.\n\n\"Is this really the kind of thing you should get embarrassed about, Jacob?\"\n\nAllison asks playfully, but your mind is elsewhere. This whole experience for you is so confusing. How can you be so infatuated with someone you just met? Somehow it feels like you\u0027ve known Allison for so much longer. The two of you finishing eating and go on to the next activity.\n","page 244":"Your body moves before you can even think, as you jump forward towards the rail. Reaching over, you somehow manage to grab her wrist in time. Olivia looks down at the water, terrified, then back up to you. She says nothing, but the look in her eyes tells you she\u0027s pleading for you to not let go. Using all of what is left of your strength, you grip her tightly, and pull her up and over the rail. She awkwardly falls on top of you, as you fall backward from the motion.\n\nYou lay there silently, expecting Olivia to roll off of you at any time, but instead she reaches her arms around you and hugs you, pushing her head into your chest. You hear her start to cry again.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m back now. You\u0027re not alone anymore.\"\n\nYou say, trying to reassure her. More memories of the two of you again flood your mind. None of them seem particularly special, but for some reason thinking about them makes you happy. Olivia lays on you crying for another few minutes, before she finally stands up. You pick up your umbrella and open it, handing it to her. Not that it matters at this point, as you\u0027re both thoroughly drenched.\n\nFiguring she shouldn\u0027t be alone right now, you decide to bring her back to your house, and she doesn\u0027t oppose. Once there, your mother throws a fit, trying to figure out why you\u0027re both soaked, and why you brought a girl over at night. You try and explain the situation as best you can, and she immediately becomes sympathetic. Once everything has calmed down, Olivia explains her situation a bit more. When you stop her and ask why she came over this morning, she explains that she wanted to see if you wanted to try and meet with Brent again.\n\nAfter that, she explains that a few years after you left, her parents got a divorce, and her father left while she stayed with her mother. While her mother never actually left her house, she did blame Olivia for the divorce, and as such effectively disowned her, and has ignored her since. According to Olivia, any friends she made would eventually betray her in some way. Girls just didn\u0027t get along with her, and boys seemed to always want to just use her. Dealing with all of that eventually lead her to this state. While you don\u0027t think of her romantically, you assure her that you won\u0027t be leaving her again.\n","page 122":"After the fair, you and Allison make your way to a bench just outside of the fairgrounds. According to Allison, this bench is the best viewpoint for the fireworks they\u0027re having. You weren\u0027t aware they were even having fireworks, so you just agreed with her to view them from here. The cold air getting at the her, Allison moves closer to you and rests her head on your shoulders.\n\nAt this point, you think it\u0027s all but official the two of you are dating now. All you\u0027d need to do now is lean down and kiss her, but you put it off for now. Whether it\u0027s fear, or nervousness, or something else, something inside of you is saying not to right now. Your feelings seem to be somewhat conflicted on the manner still.\n\nAllison shifts her weight and nudges in closer to you, causing you to unconsciously put your arm around her. She looks up at you and smiles, and you turn your head and blush. She really is cute, is all you can think about at this moment. Her long blonde and pink stripped hair flows down into her lap, and her bright blue eyes seem to shine even on this poorly lit bench. If she was just cute you could probably deal with ignoring her, but she seems to understand you perfectly, something you never thought could happen.\n\nSuddenly, the fireworks start, interrupting your internal conflict. You hadn\u0027t even noticed, but by now others have all gathered around the two of you to watch the fireworks. Luckily, you and Allison still have space between you and them, but you\u0027re suddenly really self-conscious that you\u0027re holding her in your arms. The bright lights and loud sounds of the fireworks seem to memorize the crowd for the few brief minutes they burst in the sky. Then, as quickly as they started, the fireworks end, and the crowd begins to disperse around you.\n\nAs they do, Allison grips a hold of your hand that\u0027s currently around her, and looks into your eyes.\n\n\"Hey, Jacob?\"\n\n\"H...Hm?\"\n\n\"This is okay, right?\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"The two of us, together. It\u0027s okay....right?\"\n\nAllison asks, as if she\u0027s pleading for you to answer for her. You\u0027re not sure if she\u0027s also conflicted, or if she just notices you are, but you need to answer her, to make a decision.\n","page 125":"After the fair, you and Allison make your way to a bench just outside of the fairgrounds.

Next you play around in the hall of mirrors, then you go to the haunted house. It\u0027s at this point Allison questions whether or not you\u0027d consider these rides or attractions, but you insist they count. After that, you decide to take her to a \u0027real\u0027 ride, the roller coaster that they have.\n\nThe roller coaster turns out to be a success, and after it you take her to some spinning cups, spinning cages, and finally, the Ferris wheel. From the start the Ferris wheel had been the only ride you really wanted to take her on, admittedly with an ulterior motive.\n\nThe two of you reach the top of the Ferris wheel and it stops. You gaze at the view. While it doesn\u0027t go that high, and there\u0027s nothing particular unique about the scenery in your town, there\u0027s something peaceful about seeing it from up here. You turn to Allison, who sighs as she too gazes into the distance.\n\n\"Hey, Jacob?\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"What do you think about me?\"\n\nShe asks. With her eyes looking elsewhere, she doesn\u0027t see you immediately dart your eyes away from her. You had come up here hoping for some sort of romantic scenario to unfold, but her tone and eyes seem distant and sad. Like she\u0027s trying to reaffirm something rather, than ask you for real.\n\n\"I like you, of course.\"\n\nYou manage to reply. You don\u0027t quite have the courage to say you love her as it stands, but you can at least say this much. She turns to you and smiles.\n\n\"Yeah....I know....\"\n\nAllison replies in almost a whisper.\n\n\"Thanks, I just needed to hear that. Sorry to make you uncomfortable.\"\n\nShe says in a more normal tone. You can\u0027t stand to see her looking so depressed, so you quickly reply.\n\n\"Don\u0027t be. I\u0027m having fun.\"\n\nYou say with a smile. She smiles back, and the ride continues. After exiting the Ferris wheel, you decide on where you want to head to next.\n","page 245":"Congratulations!

I\u0027m sorry Allison.\"\n\nYou reply as you look to the side, unable to face her properly. There\u0027s a brief moment of silence between you, before Allison speaks.\n\n\"You\u0027re probably right. I need to stop this....\"\n\nShe says softly.\n\n\"I keep getting side-tracked into my own delusions, and I keep doing all these selfish things...\"\n\nShe continues.

She\u0027s saying all these things you don\u0027t understand.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nYou manage to ask, curiosity gaining the better of you.

You manage to wake yourself up at about 1:30pm, in time to see Tina sitting in your living room with your mother. Oddly enough, your mother seems to be consoling her, as Tina is crying. After a quick look up and down, you see Tina is actually slightly injured. Your mother looks up at you and frowns.\n\n\"Jacob, did you know Tina went to the fair alone yesterday?\"\n\nYou frown back. Of course you\u0027d have no idea about something like that.\n\n\"No? Why?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"Well, she did, and this is what happened.\"\n\nYour mother replies. You look Tina up and down again, and don\u0027t really see the big deal. She doesn\u0027t appear to be that injured. To you it looks like she just got in a small scuffle. Not wanting to make your mother more upset, you attempt to show some sympathy.\n\n\"That sucks. Who did it?\"\n\n\"She won\u0027t tell me.\"\n\nYour mother replies. With that, it seems your mother draws her attention back to your sister. You shrug it off, and make yourself something to eat. You consider hanging out with Ian for the rest of the day, but decide against it. He\u0027s been avoiding you lately, and you really don\u0027t feel like going through the effort of properly telling him there\u0027s nothing between you and Olivia right now.\n\nLater into the day you sit on your bed, bored, and look out your window idly. It\u0027s raining right now, which you find somewhat depressing. You hear a soft knock on your door, and your mother walks in. It seems like she finally got Tina to calm down.\n\n\"By the way, Jacob.\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"A girl came over for you this morning. Her name was Olivia.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"It\u0027s funny, she kind of looks like the Olivia you used to play with when you were a kid.\"\n\nShe says with a slight laugh.

You shrug it off as another one of her weird moments, and stand up as well. You take hold of her hand, and the two of you leave.

You watch as they pass you by the front gate, but decide it\u0027s best not to confront them for the time being. Shortly after, you see Tina timidly walk by. She turns and notices you standing by the front gate, a mixture of fear and confusion in her eyes.\n\n\"Why...are you here?\"\n\nShe asks. You pause to think for a moment, and just as you\u0027re about to say something, your mother pulls up beside the two of you.\n\n\"Tina, who is...wait, Jacob? What are you doing here?\"\n\nShe asks, repeating Tina\u0027s question. Not wanting to admit you skipped the later half of classes to search for a girl you barely know, you lie.\n\n\"I just decided to pick up Tina is all.\"\n\nYou say. Your mother looks at you skeptically, but tells you and your sister to get in anyway. On the drive back, she reminds you that you need to wake up early to bring Tina to school tomorrow, since she works all day Saturday. You groan in response, but otherwise say nothing, and the rest of the night passes by without anything happening.\n","page 75":"You happily decide to sleep in, it\u0027s Saturday after all. You do the same as all teenagers in high school do, sleep as much as possible.\n\nOr rather, you would have spent it sleeping, had you not been rudely awoken at about two by someone knocking on your front door. You groan as you exit your bed and move downstairs to answer the door.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask angrily as you open it, only to find Allison happily standing in front of you. She smiles as you open the door.\n\n\"Why hello there, Jacob, or should I say good morning?\"\n\nShe says cheekily. You open your mouth to retort, but she interrupts you.\n\n\"Anyway, I\u0027ve been out here for a while, so can I come it?\"\n\nShe continues, you go to reply, but she again interrupts you.\n\n\"What do you mean no? Would you really leave a cute girl outside in the cold?\"\n\nYou stand silently and glare at her as she attempts to make a cute pose.\n\n\"...Done?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n","page 74":"Remembering your mother\u0027s words, you quickly spring to life early in the morning, and prepare to take your sister to school. Though, all that really involves is you walking a few blocks with her. Although you should have your license at this age (and after a quick check you confirm you do), your mother has the only vehicle, so driving your sister is out of the question. After getting ready you exit your door to find Tina standing there, her fist seemingly prepared to knock. An awkward moment of silence follows as you look at her, contemplating why you two never talk in the future.\n\n\"We...have to go soon.\"\n\nShe manages to say, looking down at the ground to avoid eye contact. Why the hell does it seem like she\u0027s afraid? It annoys you, but you try to ignore it. Your own sister, afraid of you.\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go.\"\n\nYou say, walking past her and towards the door. Come to think of it, you moved around a few times while you were a child, and a good portion of it was due to her. Even though Ian is your best friend, now and in the future, you had only become friends with him a year ago at this point in time. You had lived here before, years ago when you were a child, but you had to moved because of your father\u0027s work. You moved back eventually, but it was only due to Tina getting accepted into the private school she\u0027s currently attending.\n\nFinally ready, the two of you exit the house and begin the walk towards her school. It\u0027s done mainly in silence, and as you get closer to the school, she seems to unconsciously move closer to you, distancing herself again whenever you notice. It always annoyed you how quiet and shy she seemed to be. Once at the school\u0027s large and elegant gates, you stop.\n\n\"There, have fun at school.\"\n\nYou say, as you begin to walk away.\n\n\"U-um...\"\n\nYou hear a small voice say behind you as you go to walk.\n\n\"Can you pick me up after...after school...?\"\n\nYou hear your sister request. Turning to her you sigh.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nYou ask in an obviously annoyed tone. Tina nervously moves back as she clutches her bag.\n\n\"Just because...\"\n\nYou remember how yesterday you saw her get bullied by that group of students. Maybe that has something to do with why she wants to be picked up...\n","page 251":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off.

You sit down, and look over at her.\n\n\"So, why are we here?\"\n\nYou ask, confused.\n\n\"We\u0027re here to solve everything. The place where it all began is right here after all, so it should be the place where it all ends, right?\"\n\nShe replies confidently. She then puts her left hand on her right wrist, which suddenly reveals an odd looking bracelet you don\u0027t recall ever seeing. Noticing your confusion, Allison addresses it.\n\n\"Yeah, time travel sure is mysterious. For some reason, it seems this bracelet actually exists out of time, so no one else can see it...or something like that.\"\n\nAllison explains, you think. She then hits a switch on the bracelet, and it opens up, falling off of her wrist and onto her lap. Allison stares at it for a good minute, before picking it up and handing it to you. Cautiously, you accept it from her.\n\n\"Put it on.\"\n\nShe commands softly. You place it on your right wrist, and clip it into place. An odd sensation runs through you as you do, but nothing else seems to change about your surroundings.\n\n\"Um...can you explain what\u0027s going on now?\"\n\nYou ask, now even more confused by her actions. As you ask her, you notice Allison actually begin to cry, which does nothing to help your confusion.\n\n\"Ah, wait, I\u0027m not mad or anything...\"\n\nYou say quickly, thinking you\u0027re the source of it. Allison rubs the tears from her eye using her sleeve, and seems to steel herself, as she stops crying.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...for everything.\"\n\nAllison says softly.\n\n\"I\u0027ll explain what\u0027s going to happen now though.\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll only explain what you\u0027re going to be doing.

Before you get a chance to say something, you find her kissing you again. You still want an explanation, but you have a hard time pushing her off of you in such a situation. The kiss is brief, as Allison quickly pulls herself off of you, and practically jumps away. You notice that again, she\u0027s started crying.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...really...I\u0027ll try and pull it together.\"\n\nShe says, rubbing the tears in her eyes again.\n","page 131":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off.

The teacher announces that there was a break in at the school, and that several windows were destroyed during it. Luckily, it doesn\u0027t seem like they know it was you, nor do they have the means of finding out it was you, so you seem to be safe.\n\nBut you don\u0027t feel relieved. Allison is still missing, and her declaration that she\u0027s jumping through time, along with her not being a registered student, just leaves you anxious and worried. You try and justify doing nothing, and waiting for her to return up until lunch time, to no avail. You need to find her, that\u0027s what you think. You\u0027re obsessing over a girl you barely know, but you don\u0027t care. For some reason worrying about Allison just feels natural.\n\nAt lunch you tell Ian that you\u0027re leaving to look for Allison.\n\n\"Really? Well alright, want help?\"\n\nHe asks. You ponder over receiving help from Ian, but decide against dragging him into this. For starters you plan to just search the town at random, again, and it didn\u0027t turn out well last time. Even you let him help, you\u0027re not sure what he could really do.\n\n\"No, it\u0027s okay, I\u0027m pretty sure I know where she is anyway.

You wander around aimlessly for a while, hoping you\u0027ll run into her, before giving in and heading to the only place you can think of - the park.\n","page 233":"With your friendship mended, you begin to feel pretty good about your situation. Though, even if you\u0027ve fixed that, you still think you need to help Olivia with her boyfriend, Brent, somehow. That will have to come later though, for now you should focus on your immediate goal.\n\n\"Hey, Olivia, are we still on for the fair?\"\n\nYou ask, as the two of you sit in the cafeteria together. Ian seems to have been avoiding the two of you lately, maybe under the wrong impression that you want to date her or something. You can\u0027t really blame him though. Olivia is admittedly cute, you just don\u0027t think about her that way.\n\n\"The fair?\"\n\nOlivia asks. It seems like she forgot about agreeing to go with you earlier in the week.\n\n\"Yeah, I asked if you wanted to come to the fair with me before, remember?\"\n\n\"Ah...right!\"\n\nShe says with a short laugh.\n\n\"Sorry, I\u0027m usually not one to forget things like that.\"\n\n\"It\u0027s fine. We still on?\"\n\nYou ask. You\u0027re not sure why, but you really think the two of you need to go to the fair together. Olivia ponders for a moment before answering.\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose we can.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"So, you don\u0027t think Brent will mind?\"\n\nYou ask. You hate to bring that up now, but you\u0027d hate even more for her to get in trouble with him for going with you.\n\n\"Ah...don\u0027t worry about Brent. He\u0027ll be fine with it.\"\n\nOlivia says, reassuring you. You\u0027re not entirely convinced, but you\u0027re not exactly going to push the matter if she feels that way. The two of you finish eating lunch, and the next day the fair comes.\n","page 114":"\"Let\u0027s go eat some food.\"\n\nYou tell Allison.\n\nAllison gives you a strange look. \"It\u0027s a bit earlier for food don\u0027t you think?\" She says skeptically. You shrug and lead her to the food area anyway.\n\nThe food from the fair is exactly as you would have expected it to be. It\u0027s expensive, high in fat and sugars, and wildly mediocre in taste at best. However the two of you manage to enjoy some nachos together, and afterwards some cotton candy. During the week Allison had told you that she loved cotton candy, so you made sure to get some for the two of you. You had separate ones of course, but it made you happy to see her happy.\n\nCome to think of it, when was the last time you felt this way? After high school you had simply followed Ian into the supermarket, a decision that didn\u0027t have much thought or effort behind it. Then again, you never had the ambition to do anything anyway, so you were content. At least, you thought you were.\n\n\"This is sooo good!\"\n\nAllison practically squeals in delight while eating her cotton candy.\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nShe says, stuffing some of her partly eaten cotton candy into your mouth. Embarrassed, you eat it, to which she smirks.\n\n\"Is this really the kind of thing you should get embarrassed about, Jacob?\"\n\nAllison asks playfully, but your mind is elsewhere. This whole experience for you is so confusing. How can you be so infatuated with someone you just met? Somehow it feels like you\u0027ve known Allison for so much longer. The two of you finishing eating and go on to the next activity.\n","page 235":"Deciding she\u0027ll probably enjoy the giant bear more, you hand it to her.\n\n\"Sure, here you go.\"\n\nYou say as you do. Olivia grabs it triumphantly and squeezes it tightly.\n\n\"Thanks!\"\n\nShe says happily.\n\n\"So, what\u0027d you think of the fair?\"\n\nYou ask her as the two of you begin to walk to her house.\n\n\"It was fun. I kind of miss doing this like this with-\"\n\nShe begins, but she suddenly stops short of finishing her sentence.\n\n\"Yeah, it was fun.\"\n\nShe says again.\n\n\"Well, that\u0027s good.\"\n\nYou reply.\n\n\"So...you\u0027re sure Brent was fine with this?\"\n\n\"Yeah...probably.\"\n\nShe replies, a bit unsure. You\u0027re really starting to worry if this was such a great idea, but there\u0027s not much you can do now after the fact. You bring Olivia back to her house, wave goodbye to her, and return to your own, exhausted.\n","page 113":"The rest of the school week passes, and Saturday finally arrives. By now you\u0027ve made lots of small talk with Allison, finding out what foods she likes, and what rides she prefers. The only thing left to do is to actually go with her. You\u0027ve arranged to meet at the fair grounds at about 3pm. Before leaving for the fair, you swing by Ian\u0027s place to see what he\u0027s up to. Unfortunately, upon arriving you find that no one is home, which you find rather confusing. Even if Ian had already left, his brother, or anyone else, should have been home. After a quick scout around his house, you confirm that no one is home, and make your way to the fair alone.\n\nYou had wanted to hang around Ian and his date to make things less awkward with Allison, but it looks like you\u0027ll have no such luck. You arrive at the spot in the fair you agreed to meet Allison at a good ten minutes earlier, enough time to give you a second to take in the experience.\n\nYou haven\u0027t been to the fair before, so the first thing you notice is the overbearing lights and sounds. You\u0027d be surprised if any sort of meaningful conversation could be had between the two of you in this environment. The carnival games create a path through the fairgrounds, and surrounding that straight path lie all of the various rides, along with some food booths. You hear the loud clanging of metal all around you, when suddenly you feel a tug on your shirt.\n\nAllison stands behind you, wearing a cute outfit you didn\u0027t expect her to wear. You really don\u0027t like thinking about her that way, but the way she\u0027s acting is forcing your mind in that direction. Then again, the fact that you took her to the fair on a date means you had accepted that you liked her, so you might as well make the best of it. Now that she\u0027s here, she looks at you expectantly, and you tell her where you plan to take her first.\n","page 234":"Olivia meets you at the entrance to the fair. Oddly enough, she seems to no longer be wearing goth clothing, and her spiked dog collar is missing. Instead, she wears a bright floral dress, and her fingernails have had the black paint removed. You unintentionally stare at her long enough for her to understand you\u0027ve noticed her change in attire.\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\nShe asks nervously, tugging at the sides of her dress.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nYou quickly reply, not wanting to draw too much attention to the matter. You don\u0027t think about her that way after all, even putting aside the moral issue of you technically being a decade older than her. That being said, you can\u0027t help but think she looks much better in brighter colours. Olivia smiles and walks inside to the fair, and you follow her.\n\nThe layout of the fair is pretty straight forward. The carnival games create a path through the fairgrounds, and surrounding that straight path lie all of the various rides, along with some food booths. Olivia takes the lead for the afternoon, and pulls you around from ride to ride, then food booth to food booth, then finally through the fair games. Surprisingly, you find you\u0027re actually pretty good at the fair games. Since you\u0027ve never been to a fair before, you hadn\u0027t thought you would be.\n\nDuring the fair you find your mind wandering from time to time. You wonder about Olivia\u0027s relationship with Brent, and how she can stand to be with him. You think back to when she brought you to your old school, and wonder what she wanted to show you. What you wonder about most though, is why you feel this nostalgic feeling whenever you\u0027re around Olivia. It\u0027s been bothering you this whole time, but you can\u0027t figure it out. The two of you only met this week after all, so it\u0027s incredibly odd that you would feel this way. Maybe she reminds you of someone else that you used to know?\n\nAs the fair reaches its end, that\u0027s the conclusion you reach. While the two of you leave the fair, Olivia moves closer to you.\n\n\"Hey, Jacob?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Can I....\"\n\nOlivia begins, uneasily. Your throat closes as you consider what she could want, as she moves even closer to you.\n\n\"Can I have that bear?\"\n\nShe finishes, pointing to the large stuffed bear that you won at one of the carnival games. You sigh, relieved that you don\u0027t have to deal with an awkward situation.\n","page 116":"\"Let\u0027s go on the rides.\"\n\nYou tell Allison\n\nAllison ponders the idea, before nodding happily. \"Sounds good, it\u0027s getting late so we should go on some before we go.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\nThe two of you start off with the bumper cars, where Allison proceeds to repeatedly ram you against the wall with her car, much to your dismay and her pleasure. Next you play around in the hall of mirrors, then you go to the haunted house. It\u0027s at this point Allison questions whether or not you\u0027d consider these rides or attractions, but you insist they count. After that, you decide to take her to a \u0027real\u0027 ride, the roller coaster that they have.\n\nThe roller coaster turns out to be a success, and after it you take her to some spinning cups, spinning cages, and finally, the Ferris wheel. From the start the Ferris wheel had been the only ride you really wanted to take her on, admittedly with an ulterior motive.\n\nThe two of you reach the top of the Ferris wheel and it stops. You gaze at the view. While it doesn\u0027t go that high, and there\u0027s nothing particular unique about the scenery in your town, there\u0027s something peaceful about seeing it from up here. You turn to Allison, who sighs as she too gazes into the distance.\n\n\"Hey, Jacob?\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"What do you think about me?\"\n\nShe asks. With her eyes looking elsewhere, she doesn\u0027t see you immediately dart your eyes away from her. You had come up here hoping for some sort of romantic scenario to unfold, but her tone and eyes seem distant and sad. Like she\u0027s trying to reaffirm something rather, than ask you for real.\n\n\"I like you, of course.\"\n\nYou manage to reply. You don\u0027t quite have the courage to say you love her as it stands, but you can at least say this much. She turns to you and smiles.\n\n\"Yeah....I know....\"\n\nAllison replies in almost a whisper.\n\n\"Thanks, I just needed to hear that. Sorry to make you uncomfortable.\"\n\nShe says in a more normal tone. You can\u0027t stand to see her looking so depressed, so you quickly reply.\n\n\"Don\u0027t be. I\u0027m having fun.\"\n\nYou say with a smile. She smiles back, and the ride continues. After exiting the Ferris wheel, you decide on where you want to head to next.\n","page 237":"The next day you sleep in, with it being Sunday and all. You manage to wake yourself up at about 1:30pm, in time to see Tina sitting in your living room with your mother. Oddly enough, your mother seems to be consoling her, as Tina is crying. After a quick look up and down, you see Tina is actually slightly injured. Your mother looks up at you and frowns.\n\n\"Jacob, did you know Tina went to the fair alone yesterday?\"\n\nYou frown back. Of course you\u0027d have no idea about something like that.\n\n\"No? Why?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"Well, she did, and this is what happened.\"\n\nYour mother replies. You look Tina up and down again, and don\u0027t really see the big deal. She doesn\u0027t appear to be that injured. To you it looks like she just got in a small scuffle. Not wanting to make your mother more upset, you attempt to show some sympathy.\n\n\"That sucks. Who did it?\"\n\n\"She won\u0027t tell me.\"\n\nYour mother replies. With that, it seems your mother draws her attention back to your sister. You shrug it off, and make yourself something to eat. You consider hanging out with Ian for the rest of the day, but decide against it. He\u0027s been avoiding you lately, and you really don\u0027t feel like going through the effort of properly telling him there\u0027s nothing between you and Olivia right now.\n\nLater into the day you sit on your bed, bored, and look out your window idly. It\u0027s raining right now, which you find somewhat depressing. You hear a soft knock on your door, and your mother walks in. It seems like she finally got Tina to calm down.\n\n\"By the way, Jacob.\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"A girl came over for you this morning. Her name was Olivia.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"It\u0027s funny, she kind of looks like the Olivia you used to play with when you were a kid.\"\n\nShe says with a slight laugh. You look out into the rain and think...\n","page 115":"\"Let\u0027s go win some prizes at the games.\"\n\nYou tell Allison. She smiles and nods her head.\n\n\"Yes! I love these games! You\u0027ll win me something right?\"\n\nShe asks, leaning into you.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027m not very good at them, so I can\u0027t promise anything.\"\n\nYou reply, weary of her closeness.\n\n\"That\u0027s no good Jacob. When a girl tells you to get something for her, you should just do it!\"\n\nAllison proclaims in a bossy tone.\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the way relationships work....\"\n\nYou reply skeptically.\n\n\"Probably not, but it\u0027s how ours does, hehe.\"\n\nShe says with a cheeky grin.\n\n\"Well like I said, I\u0027m not good at them, but I\u0027ll try.\"\n\n\"Great, trying is all I ask of you.\"\n\n\"So you won\u0027t be disappointed when I lose?\"\n\n\"But you won\u0027t lose.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m telling you I\u0027m n-\"\n\nYou begin to retort, but Allison holds up her hand.\n\n\"Try before deciding if you\u0027ll fail or not.\"\n\nShe says calmly. You\u0027re slightly put off by her change in tone, but nod and agree to try.\n\nMuch to your surprise, you actually turn out to be pretty good at carnival games, winning a few prizes for yourself and Allison. Allison has a big \"I told you so\" smile the whole time, but you don\u0027t mind. After winning enough prizes to satisfy Allison, you decide on where you want to go to next.\n","page 236":"Deciding to tease her a bit, you tighten your grip on the large bear and smile at Olivia.\n\n\"Nope, it\u0027s mine.\"\n\n\"But Jacob!\"\n\n\"Hey, you tried, and you lost.\"\n\n\"But!\"\n\n\"And I won.\"\n\n\"But!\"\n\n\"Since when are you into giant stuffed bears anyway?\"\n\nYou ask, as Olivia pouts slightly. You\u0027re rather enjoying her reaction to this.\n\n\"Hmph! Since when are you into giant stuffed bears then?\"\n\nShe asks back.\n\n\"Aren\u0027t you a man?\"\n\nShe continues, throwing salt onto the wound.\n\n\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\"\n\nShe finishes, smiling triumphantly, thinking she has won. You actually don\u0027t care too much about her rather childish insults, but you pretend to. You groan and sigh heavily, tossing the large bear into her. Unexpectedly, the bear is large enough that it actually topples her over.\n\n\"Ah...sorry.\"\n\nYou say, picking the bear up off of her so she can stand. Olivia glares at you as she helps herself up, and snatches the bear from you.\n\n\"Mine.\"\n\nShe says, clenching the bear tightly. You consider laughing at how she\u0027s acting now, but decide it\u0027s best for her pride if you don\u0027t.\n\n\"Sure thing, Olivia. Let\u0027s go then.\"\n\nYou say, leading the way with a smile. She smiles back and follows you. You bring Olivia back to her house, wave goodbye to her, and return to your own, exhausted.\n","page 118":"\"Let\u0027s go win some prizes at the games.\"\n\nYou tell Allison. She smiles and nods her head.\n\n\"Yes! I love these games! You\u0027ll win me something right?\"\n\nShe asks, leaning into you.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027m not very good at them, so I can\u0027t promise anything.\"\n\nYou reply, weary of her closeness.\n\n\"That\u0027s no good Jacob. When a girl tells you to get something for her, you should just do it!\"\n\nAllison proclaims in a bossy tone.\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the way relationships work....\"\n\nYou reply skeptically.\n\n\"Probably not, but it\u0027s how ours does, hehe.\"\n\nShe says with a cheeky grin.\n\n\"Well like I said, I\u0027m not good at them, but I\u0027ll try.\"\n\n\"Great, trying is all I ask of you.\"\n\n\"So you won\u0027t be disappointed when I lose?\"\n\n\"But you won\u0027t lose.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m telling you I\u0027m n-\"\n\nYou begin to retort, but Allison holds up her hand.\n\n\"Try before deciding if you\u0027ll fail or not.\"\n\nShe says calmly. You\u0027re slightly put off by her change in tone, but nod and agree to try.\n\nMuch to your surprise, you actually turn out to be pretty good at carnival games, winning a few prizes for yourself and Allison. Allison has a big \"I told you so\" smile the whole time, but you don\u0027t mind. After winning enough prizes to satisfy Allison, you decide on where you want to go to next.\n","page 239":"You wonder why Olivia came to visit you, but don\u0027t think too much of it. You thank your mother for telling you, then continue to look out the window at the rain. She probably just came over to see if you wanted to do something during the day, but it\u0027s a bit late now to do anything.\n\nHowever, the next day you arrive at school and she\u0027s not there. A week passes, and you wonder where she could be, when suddenly the teacher makes an announcement during the morning. It seems that Olivia is missing, and hasn\u0027t been seen since your mother saw her the last Sunday. While he tried to assure everyone there was no reason for alarm, the fact that he brought it up means they are concerned.\n\nWeeks turns into months, which turn into years, and Olivia remains missing for all of that time. You spent may days trying to find her, but with no luck. As for your own future, you end up pursuing the same career path you did originally, becoming a stock boy with Ian. It seems even with going back in time, you weren\u0027t able to change the future for the better. If anything, you may have made it worse.\n","page 117":"\"Let\u0027s go on the rides.\"\n\nYou tell Allison\n\n\n\nShe replies.\n\nThe two of you start off with the bumper cars, where Allison proceeds to repeatedly ram you against the wall with her car, much to your dismay and her pleasure. Next you play around in the hall of mirrors, then you go to the haunted house. It\u0027s at this point Allison questions whether or not you\u0027d consider these rides or attractions, but you insist they count. After that, you decide to take her to a \u0027real\u0027 ride, the roller coaster that they have.\n\nThe roller coaster turns out to be a success, and after it you take her to some spinning cups, spinning cages, and finally, the Ferris wheel. From the start the Ferris wheel had been the only ride you really wanted to take her on, admittedly with an ulterior motive.\n\nThe two of you reach the top of the Ferris wheel and it stops. You gaze at the view. While it doesn\u0027t go that high, and there\u0027s nothing particular unique about the scenery in your town, there\u0027s something peaceful about seeing it from up here. You turn to Allison, who sighs as she too gazes into the distance.\n\n\"Hey, Jacob?\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"What do you think about me?\"\n\nShe asks. With her eyes looking elsewhere, she doesn\u0027t see you immediately dart your eyes away from her. You had come up here hoping for some sort of romantic scenario to unfold, but her tone and eyes seem distant and sad. Like she\u0027s trying to reaffirm something rather, than ask you for real.\n\n\"I like you, of course.\"\n\nYou manage to reply. You don\u0027t quite have the courage to say you love her as it stands, but you can at least say this much. She turns to you and smiles.\n\n\"Yeah....I know....\"\n\nAllison replies in almost a whisper.\n\n\"Thanks, I just needed to hear that. Sorry to make you uncomfortable.\"\n\nShe says in a more normal tone. You can\u0027t stand to see her looking so depressed, so you quickly reply.\n\n\"Don\u0027t be. I\u0027m having fun.\"\n\nYou say with a smile. She smiles back, and the ride continues. After exiting the Ferris wheel, you decide on where you want to head to next.\n","page 238":"Your heart drops as memories suddenly flash through your mind. It\u0027s not that she just looks like the Olivia you played with as a kid, it really is that same Olivia. All of these strange feelings of nostalgia you were feeling with her finally make sense. Yet you...\n\nYou forgot about her.\n\nYour best friend from when you were a child.\n\nAnd you forgot about her.\n\nThe thought makes you feel sick to your stomach, but an even worse thought goes through your mind.\n\nBut she didn\u0027t...\n\nYou forgot about her, but she didn\u0027t forget about you.\n\nThat\u0027s why she seemed so upset at you.\n\nIt\u0027s only natural. At this point in time you had been back for almost a year, yet you ignored her all that time.\n\nThat\u0027s why she brought you to the school.\n\nTo help jog your memory. But then why...\n\nWhy did she lie to you?\n\nAfter the school you flat out asked her if the two of you knew each other. No, even before then, you had asked her when you first came back in time if you knew each other. She denied it both times, but why? A sickening feeling comes over yourself as you realize why. Of course she\u0027d deny it. It\u0027d be too painful for her to admit that you knew each other after all that time had past. It\u0027d be too sad for her to admit she knew all this time, but never said anything.\n\nYou can\u0027t even imagine how she felt, seeing you every day, being reminded of your past together, yet knowing you didn\u0027t remember her. It must have been hard for her when you said you wanted to be friends with her, completely obviously to the fact that you were already friends before. It probably made her feel like she never meant anything to you, and that the times you spent together were worthless to you.\n\nBut that\u0027s not true.\n\nThey weren\u0027t worthless. You look back into your memories and can remember times you spent with her. She was much happier when you were younger. In fact, how she acted at the fair seemed reminiscent of how she used to act. You wonder what caused her change in personality, and as you do you jump out of your bed and rush to the front door. Your mother quickly jumps out of your path and says something to you as you move past her, but you can\u0027t hear her.\n\nYou can\u0027t think of anything right now but apologizing to Olivia. You can\u0027t take back how you acted until now, but you can change how you will act in the future. You curse your stupidity for not realizing it sooner, as you grab your umbrella and throw open the front door, running towards Olivia\u0027s house.\n","page 88":"The next morning comes and you head out to school with Ian like normal. The day passes and nothing of interest happens at all. You\u0027re not surprised or disappointed by this. Thinking back, this was the way you had always lived, simply going through life day after day, doing as little as possible. With no real ambition, you\u0027re likely to end up right back at the grocery store after you graduate. Maybe fate really is preventing you from changing your ways, or maybe you\u0027re just afraid of what might happen if you pursue something you actually want. If you\u0027re just going to fail and get disappointed anyway, then what\u0027s the point of trying to change, right?\n\nAt least, that\u0027s what you think.\n\nYou become content with falling back into your high school routine. Weeks pass, and the thought that you\u0027re a decade in the past is all but a distant memory. That\u0027s fine though. This is what was supposed to happen; the way it\u0027s meant to be. It\u0027s because of fate, so it\u0027s not your fault that you were unsuccessful in changing anything.\n\nAt least, that\u0027s what you tell yourself.\n","page 87":"You look across at Ian and sigh. You can\u0027t really think of anyone to go with, and you really don\u0027t want to go to the fair alone, which only leaves one choice....\n\n\"What are you saying Ian, I\u0027m going with you of course.\"\n\nYou say, trying to sound as natural as possible.\n\n\"You\u0027re what?\"\n\n\"I can\u0027t really think of anyone else to go with...\"\n\n\".........\"\n\nYou and Ian sit in silence for a minute, before he breaks it.\n\n\"...I don\u0027t swing that way Ja-\"\n\n\"I don\u0027t either!\"\n\nYou quickly interrupt.\n\n\"Well I was going to take Olivia, so you\u0027re out of luck man. I ain\u0027t gonna go with you over her.\"\n\n\"Really? I didn\u0027t know you were into Olivia.\"\n\nYou reply. Though, all things considered you can see the link pretty easily. He talks with her often, goes to the same club, and even introduced her to you.\n\n\"I suppose there\u0027s only one solution to this then...\"\n\nYou begin. Ian nods in anticipation.\n\n\"I\u0027ll have to come with the two of you.\"\n\nYou finish with a smirk. Ian glares at you.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"I\u0027ll hit you.\"\n\n\"Man, I wonder ride we should go on first.\"\n\n\"No seriously, I\u0027ll hit you.\"\n\n\"I think the Ferris wheel would be romantic, don\u0027t you?\"\n\n\"God damn you Jacob.\"\n\nIan says defeated. You laugh, content that you angered him. You don\u0027t really plan to mess with him and Olivia while they\u0027re there, but you probably will go and leave with them.\n\n\"Doesn\u0027t she have a boyfriend though?\"\n\nYou ask, suddenly remembering how she had really tried to stress that fact with the two of you.\n\n\"Well, I never see her with him, so he can\u0027t be that important.\"\n\nHe replies. You shrug, unable to argue with him about that. The conversation ends, and a few hours later Ian leaves and the night ends.\n","page 119":"After the fair, you and Allison make your way to a bench just outside of the fairgrounds. According to Allison, this bench is the best viewpoint for the fireworks they\u0027re having. You weren\u0027t aware they were even having fireworks, so you just agreed with her to view them from here. The cold air getting at the her, Allison moves closer to you and rests her head on your shoulders.\n\nAt this point, you think it\u0027s all but official the two of you are dating now. All you\u0027d need to do now is lean down and kiss her, but you put it off for now. Whether it\u0027s fear, or nervousness, or something else, something inside of you is saying not to right now. Your feelings seem to be somewhat conflicted on the manner still.\n\nAllison shifts her weight and nudges in closer to you, causing you to unconsciously put your arm around her. She looks up at you and smiles, and you turn your head and blush. She really is cute, is all you can think about at this moment. Her long blonde and pink stripped hair flows down into her lap, and her bright blue eyes seem to shine even on this poorly lit bench. If she was just cute you could probably deal with ignoring her, but she seems to understand you perfectly, something you never thought could happen.\n\nSuddenly, the fireworks start, interrupting your internal conflict. You hadn\u0027t even noticed, but by now others have all gathered around the two of you to watch the fireworks. Luckily, you and Allison still have space between you and them, but you\u0027re suddenly really self-conscious that you\u0027re holding her in your arms. The bright lights and loud sounds of the fireworks seem to memorize the crowd for the few brief minutes they burst in the sky. Then, as quickly as they started, the fireworks end, and the crowd begins to disperse around you.\n\nAs they do, Allison grips a hold of your hand that\u0027s currently around her, and looks into your eyes.\n\n\"Hey, Jacob?\"\n\n\"H...Hm?\"\n\n\"This is okay, right?\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"The two of us, together. It\u0027s okay....right?\"\n\nAllison asks, as if she\u0027s pleading for you to answer for her. You\u0027re not sure if she\u0027s also conflicted, or if she just notices you are, but you need to answer her, to make a decision.\n","page 89":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off. You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n“Hey Jake.”\n\n“Hey Ian, ready for another exciting day?” You ask sarcastically.\n\n“Oh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.” He replies with equal sarcasm, “I hope I never quit.”\n\n“Ah yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn’t it?”\n\n“A lifelong-dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to live that dream.”\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there’s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it’s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o’clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.\n","page 80":"A few minutes later you hear the bell ring and students from the private school start walking out of the door. You were always a bit jealous that your sister was able to go to a private school and that you weren\u0027t. After your sister was accepted into her first private school six years ago (from this point in time), you demanded that your mother let you take the entrance exam as well. You failed it, and that was the first and last time you tried. Defeated, you went to the public school of the area and that was that.\n\nSoon enough, you notice your sister exit the school. You see Allison smile as she sees her.\n\n\"Your sister really was cute.\"\n\nShe says in a distant tone. Tina notices you and hurries towards you, but when she reaches the other side of the school\u0027s gates, she stops and stares at Allison. A moment of silence goes by as Allison smiles at her, before realizing Tina has no idea who she is.\n\n\"Oh, um hi, Tina, I\u0027m Allison.\"\n\nShe says, awkwardly introducing herself. Tina manages out a smile and nods in response. The three of you begin your walk back to your house, and as you do your sister walks a little closer to you and tries to whisper.\n\n\"How do you know her?\"\n\nShe asks. Allison is close enough to notice her whisper, but probably can\u0027t hear her. Though, you\u0027re not really sure how to answer that question anyway, so you decide to go the safe route.\n\n\"She\u0027s a new classmate at my school.\"\n\nYou respond. It doesn\u0027t answer the heart of Tina\u0027s question, which was likely \u0027Why is she with you?\u0027, but she doesn\u0027t pry any further. Once you arrive home, Allison says her goodbyes, and the day proceeds with nothing else happening.\n","page 82":"You wake up the next morning to the sound of your mother calling for you, saying something about a phone. You slowly manage to wake yourself up and get dressed, only to have your mom scold you when you finally get downstairs.\n\n\"Honestly Jacob, it\u0027s noon now, it shouldn\u0027t take you this long to wake up on a Sunday.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"You won\u0027t be successful in life if you spend all your time sleeping.\"\n\nYou nod your head, still somewhat asleep in response. You can\u0027t really disagree with her, given she\u0027s right about not being successful in life, though you rather doubt it\u0027s because you tend to sleep in. After she finishes scolding you she explains that Ian called and that you need to call him back, so you take the phone and return his call.\n\n\"Hm? Why did I call?\"\n\nIan asks after you call him.\n\n\"I\u0027m bored, so I wanted to hang out. You busy?\"\n\nHe continues. You tell him you\u0027re not so he says he\u0027ll be over in a minute and hangs up. About twenty minutes later he comes over, and the two of you spend the afternoon together at your house. You reminisce about the times when you and Ian used to do these kinds of things. For you, high school was probably the high-light of your life, as after that you accomplished nothing but working in a dead end job. Sure it could have been worse, but you still wonder about what could have been. Eventually Ian asks you a question you didn\u0027t expect.\n\n\"So, who you goin\u0027 to the fair with?\"\n\nHe asks.

The mysterious girl has been on your mind quite a bit lately, and you still don\u0027t know a lot about her. The fair would be a great time to get to know her, especially given she basically just confessed she loved you the other day at the park. There\u0027s no way she should feel that strongly about you after such a short time.\n\n\"Allison? Oh, the new girl in our class? I didn\u0027t know you guys were talking.\"\n\nHe says, mildly shocked.\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027ve been talking with her this past week.\"\n\n\"Hmm...well good luck man.\"\n\nIan says.\n\n\"So, who are you goin\u0027 with?\"\n\nYou ask, turning the subject onto him.\n\n\"Me? Hm...I was gonna ask Olivia.\"\n\n\"Olivia? Really?\"\n\nYou say surprised. Though, thinking back it shouldn\u0027t be too surprising.

I\u0027m not asking her to date, I\u0027m just seeing if she wants to go to the fair with me.\"\n\nHe retorts. Ian\u0027s intentions here are obvious, but he\u0027s really trying to deny them. You weren\u0027t aware he was into Olivia though. Thinking back it kind of makes sense, they\u0027re both on the chess team, and he even introduced her to you.\n\n\"Anyway, she might say no, but you never know.\"\n\nHe finishes. You give a short nod, and the conversation ends.

It\u0027s not like we have to be dating to go together.\"\n\n\"You sure her boyfriend will think the same?\"\n\nHe replies. You frown, remembering that she told you several times that she has a boyfriend. But, you don\u0027t have those kind of intentions with her anyway. You just get the feeling going with her will be a good thing.\n\n\"Pfft, that doesn\u0027t matter.\"\n\nYou say. Ian doesn\u0027t give more than a shrug, indicating he won\u0027t press the subject any further.\n\n\"So, who you going with, since you were so interested who I was going to go with?\"\n\nYou ask. Ian seems to pause and think that over.\n\n\"Hmmm...I don\u0027t really know.\"\n\n\"Really? Why were you curious who I was going with then?\"\n\n\"Guess I was just wondering is all.\"\n\nHe replies, then he sighs.\n\n\"I had an idea, but I didn\u0027t go through with it yet.\"\n\n\"Well, you gonna?\"\n\nIan shrugs impassively.\n\n\"Naw, I\u0027ve lost interest.\"\n\n\"Oh...well okay then.\"\n\nYou say, confused as to why Ian would lose interest, but not really caring too much about it. That ends the conversation about the fair, and after a few more hours together, Ian leaves and the night ends.\n","page 85":"\"I think I\u0027m going to take Tina.\"\n\nYou reply. You haven\u0027t spent much time with your sister since you came back in time, so this would be a good chance. Come to think of it, you don\u0027t spend too much time with her in the future either.

I didn\u0027t think you two were close.\"\n\nIan replies, as you would expect.\n\n\"Well, we aren\u0027t really, but that can change right?\"\n\n\"Ha, damn right it can change! Siblings gotta be close. Nothing sadder than not getting along with your own flesh and blood.\"\n\nHe says firmly. You\u0027re reminded that Ian has a brother of his own, so he\u0027s probably talking more from experience here. At the moment you can\u0027t remember his name, so you just decide to ignore it.\n\n\"So, who you going with, Ian?\"\n\n\"Me? Well I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 with my brother that\u0027s for sure, haha. Naw, I think I\u0027ll ask Olivia to go with me.\"\n\nHe replies.

You managed enough sense to grab an umbrella, but in your haste you forgot your coat. Initially you thought you ran out in such a hurry because of how sorry you felt, but as you got closer to her house you began to feel uneasy. It\u0027s a different feeling from the self-loathing you felt after remembering you knew Olivia, like something bad is about to happen.\n\nYou reach the front entrance of Olivia\u0027s house, soaking wet now. None of the lights are on, which is odd given how late it is. You knock on the front door a few times, but get no answer. Your bad feeling now getting worse, you knock even louder a few more times, but still get no answer. You want to think that everything is fine, and that she must be at Brent\u0027s house or somewhere else, perfectly fine, but for some reason you don\u0027t think that is the case. Olivia came to visit you this morning, according to your mother, but what was that about?\n\nSuddenly, you remember how when you were kids, the two of you would always enter her house through a low window at the side that was always kept unlock. Circling the house, you quickly find the window, and after a brief moment of contemplation, squeeze through it and enter the house.\n\nBut she\u0027s not home. You even take the liberty of looking inside of every room, but find no one. As you exit out the window, you wonder why you feel so uneasy. Then a terrible thought goes through your mind, sending a shiver down your spine.\n\nThe bridge...\n\nYou recall crossing the bridge with Olivia, and her strange behaviour, and finally you find the source of your unease. There\u0027s no way that could be the case though. There\u0027s no way she would be at the bridge. There\u0027s no way that she\u0027ll be there.\n\nShe won\u0027t be there. She won\u0027t be there. She won\u0027t be there.\n\nIs what you repeatedly tell yourself, as you sprint towards the bridge.\n","page 121":"\"Let\u0027s go win some prizes at the games.\"\n\nYou tell Allison. She smiles and nods her head.\n\n\"Yes! I love these games! You\u0027ll win me something right?\"\n\nShe asks, leaning into you.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027m not very good at them, so I can\u0027t promise anything.\"\n\nYou reply, weary of her closeness.\n\n\"That\u0027s no good Jacob. When a girl tells you to get something for her, you should just do it!\"\n\nAllison proclaims in a bossy tone.\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the way relationships work....\"\n\nYou reply skeptically.\n\n\"Probably not, but it\u0027s how ours does, hehe.\"\n\nShe says with a cheeky grin.\n\n\"Well like I said, I\u0027m not good at them, but I\u0027ll try.\"\n\n\"Great, trying is all I ask of you.\"\n\n\"So you won\u0027t be disappointed when I lose?\"\n\n\"But you won\u0027t lose.\"\n\n\"I\u0027m telling you I\u0027m n-\"\n\nYou begin to retort, but Allison holds up her hand.\n\n\"Try before deciding if you\u0027ll fail or not.\"\n\nShe says calmly. You\u0027re slightly put off by her change in tone, but nod and agree to try.\n\nMuch to your surprise, you actually turn out to be pretty good at carnival games, winning a few prizes for yourself and Allison. Allison has a big \"I told you so\" smile the whole time, but you don\u0027t mind. After winning enough prizes to satisfy Allison, you decide on where you want to go to next.\n","page 242":"\"I\u0027m sorry...\"\n\nYou reply, in almost a whisper. Olivia seems to just barely hear you, as she stops crying long enough to look at you.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe asks, stunned. You grip your umbrella tightly and repeat yourself.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry!\"\n\nYou yell, tears coming to your eyes as well.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry I left without saying anything! I\u0027m sorry I was gone for so long! I\u0027m sorry...\"\n\nYou yell, trying to wipe the tears out of your eyes.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry I forgot about you! I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t remember...\"\n\nYou continue. Olivia\u0027s eye\u0027s go wide again, as she realizes you remember her.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...It must have been hard...\"\n\nYou finish, no longer yelling. Your tears won\u0027t stop now. Even though you need to hold yourself together, to help Olivia, you still break down and cry. Through the tears you look up, and see her place the hand not supporting her over her mouth. You drop the umbrella and fall to the ground, exhausted. You were already exhausted physically from running so much, but now you\u0027re emotionally exhausted too. You really are overly emotional. Even so, you push through the tears and say what you know you need to say.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...but I\u0027m here now...so please...come down.\"\n\nYou say, while kneeling on the ground. Even if she can see you\u0027re sorry, and even if she can forgive you, it won\u0027t matter if she goes through with this. Olivia looks back down at the water, then back to you. Finally, ever so slowly, she moves to bring her legs back over the rail.\n\nBut then you see a look of terror in her eyes, as her hand slips, and she falls over the side of bridge, towards the water below.\n","page 120":"\"Let\u0027s go eat some food.\"\n\nYou tell Allison.\n\n\n\nThe food from the fair is exactly as you would have expected it to be. It\u0027s expensive, high in fat and sugars, and wildly mediocre in taste at best. However the two of you manage to enjoy some nachos together, and afterwards some cotton candy. During the week Allison had told you that she loved cotton candy, so you made sure to get some for the two of you. You had separate ones of course, but it made you happy to see her happy.\n\nCome to think of it, when was the last time you felt this way? After high school you had simply followed Ian into the supermarket, a decision that didn\u0027t have much thought or effort behind it. Then again, you never had the ambition to do anything anyway, so you were content. At least, you thought you were.\n\n\"This is sooo good!\"\n\nAllison practically squeals in delight while eating her cotton candy.\n\n\"Here!\"\n\nShe says, stuffing some of her partly eaten cotton candy into your mouth. Embarrassed, you eat it, to which she smirks.\n\n\"Is this really the kind of thing you should get embarrassed about, Jacob?\"\n\nAllison asks playfully, but your mind is elsewhere. This whole experience for you is so confusing. How can you be so infatuated with someone you just met? Somehow it feels like you\u0027ve known Allison for so much longer. The two of you finishing eating and go on to the next activity.\n","page 241":"You arrive at the bridge, and your heart drops. She\u0027s really here. In the middle of the bridge, sitting on one of the rails overlooking the water, with her hand holding on to one of the supporting bars, is Olivia. Even with the rain, you can tell she\u0027s crying.\n\nWhy...?\n\nIs the only thing you can think of. Why is she here? No, you can kind of figure with all things considered her reason for being here, but what would drive her to do this? She seemed to be having fun just the other day, so why? Unconsciously you begin to slowly walk towards her. You don\u0027t know what you can say or do at this point, your mind is just blank. All you know is you can\u0027t walk away. Otherwise, it might really happen. Eventually, you stop a little bit out of arms reach from her, as she notices you. Her eyes grow wide as she looks at you, and she rubs away her tears, before she quickly looks back to the water.\n\n\"...Hi, Jacob...\"\n\nShe says in an ashamed tone, while attempting to give a normal greeting. You can\u0027t say anything though. It physically pains you to see her here, to know what she\u0027s thinking about do. You can\u0027t help but feel it\u0027s partly, no, entirely your fault as well. Thinking about how she must have felt while you were gone, and when you returned. How those feelings ultimately must have lead her to being here. The two of you stay there in silence, until she speaks again.\n\n\"Brent...broke up with me...\"\n\nShe says with a sniffle.\n\n\"I told him that we went to the fair...he wasn\u0027t okay with it.\"\n\nShe continues. You figured that would be the case. If that\u0027s why she\u0027s here though, that just makes this that much more your fault. Finally, after trying to keep it in, she seems to break down.\n\n\"Hey...Jacob?\"\n\nShe begins with another sniffle.\n\n\"Why does everyone always leave me?\"\n\nOlivia says, breaking down into tears.\n\n\"Am I just that bad a person?\"\n\nAnd that\u0027s all you can take.\n\n\"Brent left me...\"\n\nIt was all you could handle just to stand there silently.\n\n\"All of my friends left me...\"\n\nYou didn\u0027t want to say anything, because you weren\u0027t sure how to handle the situation, and you didn\u0027t want to make it worse.\n\n\"Even my family left me...\"\n\nBut you can\u0027t do nothing any longer. Not when Olivia is sitting there crying. Not while she\u0027s suffering so much.\n\n\"Even you...\"\n","page 6":"Although you roughly knew how to get to the school on your own, you have no idea what class you have. You follow Ian in hopes that you have the same first class together. Once at the classroom door Ian turns to you with a puzzled look.\n\n“Aren’t you going to class?”\n\n“Uh, yea...right...”\n\n“You’re acting pretty weird today man.”\n\n“Yea well...today’s a pretty weird day for me.”\n\nIan seems even more confused now, but decides to drop it and heads to his seat once he hears the warning bell. You walk down the hallway a little further before opening up your bag in hopes of finding some sort of clue telling you where you’re supposed to be. Inside you find various notebooks and textbooks, but nothing concerning your schedule. You sigh and notice the hallway is now completely empty.\n\nThe final bell which marks the start of class should be ringing any minute and you have no idea where you’re supposed to be. Unsure of what to do, you decide to sprint down the hallway and look for whatever seems familiar. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) you find two room numbers across from each other which seem somewhat familiar: Room 134 and Room 135. You’ll have to guess which is the right room.\n","page 145":"Ian will probably never shut up about it, but you don\u0027t care. It\u0027d be nice to have some additional company anyway, and maybe you won\u0027t feel as odd around Tina if Allison is there as well.\n\n\"Yeah sure, why not. I\u0027ll meet you at the front after class.\"\n\nAllison smiles.\n\n\"Sounds good, see you then!\"\n\nShe says, leaving you and Ian.\n\n\"I told yo-\"\n\n\"Not another word.\"\n\nYou interrupt Ian as he attempts to say he told you so.\n\n\"Well, I need to see how this unfolds, so I\u0027ll be coming too.\"\n\nIan replies smugly. You don\u0027t really care, so you just shrug.\n\nClasses end and the three of you meet at the front of the school. The walk to Tina\u0027s school is largely uneventful, but Ian seems to be unusually perceptive of the interactions between you and Allison. Upon arriving, you yet again see Tina waiting on the school steps, with the same seven students around her.\n\n\"The hell is with those guys? They aren\u0027t her friends are they?\"\n\nIan asks\n\n\"I really doubt they are.\"\n\nYou reply, remembering that Tina never had any friends that she spoke of while growing up. Unlike last time, the students don\u0027t notice you, so they continue talking to Tina after you arrive. You can\u0027t quite hear what\u0027s being said, but it sounds like they\u0027re trying to threaten her. Annoyed with waiting, Ian yells.\n\n\"We\u0027re hear Tina, hurry up.\"\n\nWith that, the seven students turn to the three of you, and quickly take their leave. Tina timidly walks towards you after they\u0027re gone.\n\n\"If they\u0027re bothering you just tell us already.\"\n\nIan says, acting like an older brother.\n\n\"It\u0027s fine...really...\"\n\nTina replies, trying to reassure him. Even with everyone here, Tina doing this still annoys you. Why do you find her so annoying? You don\u0027t remember it being like this. Ian sighs, understanding that Tina won\u0027t budge on the matter, and the three of you leave silently. Surprisingly, Allison says nothing the whole time, and merely watches quietly.

Yea...bye mom....”\n\nYou quickly rush out the door and meet Ian, who innocently shrugs in response to what happened.\n\n“What? It’s not like I knew she was there.”\n\nThe walk to school is uneventful. Ian tells you some story involving his older brother but you don’t really pay attention. The thought that you’re ten years in the past is all you can think about.\n\n“Hey.”\n\nIan pushes your shoulder gently once you reach the entrance of the school and the two of you stop. He has a concerned look on his face.\n\n“You alright? You sick or something?”\n\nHe asks.\n\n“Huh? No, I’m fine.

Something about her question seems off, and after a moment you realize what that is.\n\n\"What do you mean again?\"\n\nYou ask. Allison shouldn\u0027t know you picked Tina up yesterday.\n\n\"Hm?

However, apart from her no one else looks familiar, so this isn’t your class. This is further confirmed when the teacher begins speaking to you.\n\n“Why hello, Jacob.

Tina is a pretty level headed person, so you should get right back to getting along after you get past this.\n\nThinking that she is a level headed person suddenly reminds you of something.

Private schools so good you actually moved away from the city you\u0027re in now to another city for six years, just so she could go to them.\n\nYou sigh, remembering those times. You were upset when you first moved away, which lead to you becoming a rather destructive person. When you returned to this city, you had decided to stop all that, and you were largely successful in doing so. You became a rather unambitious person as a result, but it was a lot better than being violent.\n\nSo, why did she drop out? Did something happen? Something had to have happened, you\u0027re sure of it, but you can\u0027t for the life of you remember. Does it have something to do with those other kids you keep seeing her with?

Opening your drawers you notice your clothes seem different as well. Now even more confused, you get dressed and exit your room to find some answers. Outside your door you find your younger sister standing in front of you, in the uniform that she wore during high school. That is to say, while she has the same face, green eyes, and short brown hair as your sister, she looks considerably younger than she should.\n\n“Mom says wake up.” She states quietly, then turns to walk away.\n\n“Um, Tina?” you say, trying to confirm it’s her.\n\n“Hm?”, she replies softly, turning towards you.\n\n“Ah, um, never mind.

Ten years ago you were 18 and in your last year of high school. The fact that your sister was in her private high school uniform confirms this, since she was in her first year of high school when you were in your last. Your thought process is interrupted by the familiar yell of your mother.\n\n“Jacob, hurry up! You’re going to be late!”\n\nThere’s no point in thinking over this any longer.

After all, if this really is the past then doing something different could screw up the future in a major way.\n\nYou open the door and find Ian standing in front of you.

You were upset when you first moved away, which lead to you becoming a rather destructive person. When you returned to this city, you had decided to stop all that, and you were largely successful in doing so. You became a rather unambitious person as a result, but it was a lot better than being violent.\n\nSo, why did she drop out? Did something happen? Something had to have happened, you\u0027re sure of it, but you can\u0027t for the life of you remember. Does it have something to do with those other kids you keep seeing her with? You don\u0027t remember her having friends, but maybe you\u0027re wrong and that\u0027s all they are. You sigh, unable to remember any of the answers to the questions you have now, and close your eyes.\n","page 269":"Remembering that the last time you were able to successfully help Ian, was when you rushed straight there, you follow that plan. You sprint to the \u0027Wolf den\u0027, and easily make it before anyone else gets there. In fact, because you\u0027re there so early, you actually have plenty of time to talk to Ian and Peter before the other gang shows up.\n\n\"How do you even know about this place?\"\n\nIan asks, confused.\n\n\"That\u0027s not important. Pretty soon there will be guys coming here to try and take it from you guys.\"\n\nYou respond. Peter and Ian look at each other, as if trying to determine what you\u0027re trying to say.\n\n\"Ah, it\u0027s probably those guys.\"\n\nPeter says, thinking about the rival gang. The three of you sit together and talk about idle stuff, waiting for them to arrive. You all agreed that you\u0027d have to stand up for yourselves, otherwise they would just come back again later. Sure enough, the other gang arrives right around the same time you expect them to. Luckily, you convinced Peter to put away his knife, so you don\u0027t have to actually worry about him killing anyone.\n\nThe fight turns out similar to the previous time it happened. You get beat up, but all in all you guys win, and drive the others off. Of course, you get knocked unconscious in the process, just like before. You don\u0027t even hear the \u0027pop\u0027 of the bracelet this time, indicating that you\u0027re traveling through time again.\n","page 4":"“Yeah.”\n\nYou turn and wave goodbye to your mom, who waves in response, then quickly walk down your front porch to Ian. The two of you reach the sidewalk before you take a brief look back at the house.\n\nExactly as I remember it...\n\nThe walk to school is uneventful. Ian tells you some story involving his older brother but you don’t really pay attention. The thought that you’re ten years in the past is all you can think about.\n\n“Hey.”\n\nIan pushes your shoulder once you reach the entrance of the school and the two of you stop. He has a concerned look on his face.\n\n“You alright? You sick or something?”\n\nHe asks.\n\n“Huh? No, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it.”\n\nYou walk ahead into the entrance of the school and Ian follows shortly after.\n","page 3":"You blink your eyes and look at your new surroundings. You’re alone in the middle of a classroom, a very familiar classroom. Glancing down you notice you’re sitting in a desk and that there’s a small ‘J’ carved into the bottom right of its surface. This is your desk. At least it was, some point in time many years ago. Bringing your attention back up you notice the class is now filled with other students, each sitting in their own desks frantically writing notes. You don’t recognize any of them, or rather you can’t since none of their faces are clear to you. A teacher stands at the front of the class by the blackboard, presumably lecturing, though you all you can hear are muffled words.\n\nYou idly glance around the room and notice something out of place. A girl stands in the doorway, with long blonde and pink hair, flowing down to just above her waist. You stare at her for a while, trying to remember who she might be. No one else in the class pays any attention to her, and like the rest of them, you can’t seem to make out her face. Suddenly, she turns around and runs down the hallway.\n\nYou stand up and walk out of the classroom, ignored completely by the rest of the class. As you enter the hallway, you look down the way you saw her ran, but see no one. Curious, you continue down the seemingly endless hallway trying to find her. Finally, you seem to reach the end, as a black metal door now blocks the path. Grasping the handle, you push it open. A bright light emits from the inside, blinding you and preventing you from seeing what’s beyond the door. Curiosity gaining the better of you, you close your eyes and step through the doorway.\n","page 99":"\"Then....how do you feel about me?\"\n\nYou ask nervously.\n\n\"That\u0027s easy. I love you, Jacob.\"\n\nAllison shamelessly confesses with a smirk. Your heart practically skips a beat as you hear the words leave her lips. It\u0027s just as you thought, Allison really does love you. But how? She barely knows you, right?\"\n\n\"W....why? How can you lo...love me when we barely know each other.\"\n\nYou say stuttering. You shouldn\u0027t be this nervous in front of her, after all it\u0027s not like you\u0027ll actually act on her feelings towards you. You\u0027re a decade older than her after all, it just wouldn\u0027t feel right. Even so, you\u0027ve never had a girl in love with you. You can\u0027t even put into words how you feel right now. Allison makes a cute pose and crosses her arms.\n\n\"Beep beep. Nope, you only get one question!\"\n\nShe says triumphantly.\n\n\"Besides Jacob, a cute girl just confessed her love for you. Shouldn\u0027t you be saying something in return?\"\n\nAllison says accusingly. You take a step back in confusion. She\u0027s obviously talking about saying you love her back, but can you really say such a thing? You\u0027ll admit she\u0027s cute, and you do find her personality to be fun, but are you really sure if you love her or not? It\u0027s not something you ever considered before.\n\nYou shake you\u0027re head. There\u0027s no way you can say such a thing so soon, even if it was true you\u0027ve only know Allison for a week.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nYou say. Allison pouts in response, but doesn\u0027t seem surprised.\n\n\"You would say something like that. Just admit you like me!\"\n\n\"Well, I do like you. I can\u0027t say anything beyond that though...\"\n\nYou reply earnestly.\n\n\"I really should be used to you doing this to me by now.\"\n\nShe says with a sigh.\n\n\"Oh well. That\u0027s your one question. I need to go now, see you later Jacob.\"\n\nShe says, leaving you alone in the park with a wave. You wave back and let her leave, realizing you won\u0027t be able to stop her.\n\n\"I love you, Jacob.\"\n\nAllison\u0027s words echo in your head as you watch her go. If someone had asked you what you would expect if you had gone back in time while you were in the future, a girl you never met confessing her love to you would have never come to your mind.\n","page 98":"School ends and you met Ian as per usual at the front of school, however today you have something different in mind.\n\n\"Hey, Ian, I\u0027ll catch you later, I\u0027m going to go with Allison.\"\n\nYou tell him, spotting her down the hallway. Ian nods and leaves without you, and you head towards Allison. She smiles as she sees you, apparently back to her normal self.\n\n\"Why hello there Jacob! Why haven\u0027t you left for your house yet?\"\n\nShe asks.\n\n\"Well, I was waiting for you of course. Care to walk with me?\"\n\nYou reply, gesturing for her to follow. Allison takes the hint and walks besides you.\n\n\"Hmm, and where might you be taking me?\"\n\nShe asks with a coy smile.\n\n\"It\u0027s a secret.\"\n\nYou reply smiling, mimicking how she acted to you on Saturday. Rather than demand any further answers, she just continues smiling.\n\n\"I see. Well, lead on.\"\n\nAnd with that, the two of you exit the school grounds. Just like on Saturday, the two of you end up at the park Allison brought you to. While you succeeded in asking her to the fair, you\u0027ve been pondering the rest of the day as to how you should solve the other issues with her. You\u0027re curious as to how she knows you, but you also want to know how she really feels. It\u0027s possible you just misunderstood her the other day, so you need to clarify. As the two of you enter the oddly deserted park, you go to speak, but are stopped by her placing her index finger against your mouth. The intimacy of the sudden act immediately pacifies you, and you\u0027re left awkwardly staring into Allison\u0027s eyes.\n\n\"One question. I\u0027ll answer one question, regardless of what it is, as honestly as I can.\"\n\nShe says in a serious tone, removing her finger from your lips.\n\n\"But after that I make no promises, hehe.\"\n\nShe finishes. Allison seems to have read your mind and intentions here, so rather than tempt fate, you give in and ask her one question.\n","page 9":"You enter room 135 and quickly survey its contents. The room is filled with other students which you would assume are in the same grade as you. Some of those in the class give you a quick glance, before returning their attention to the teacher. The teacher himself, a middle-aged man with a short beard, whom seems fairly familiar, looks up from his desk as you slowly enter through the doorway. He says nothing, but his reaction to you gives you the impression he knows you and that it\u0027s normal for you to be here.\n\nTaking that as your cue, you look for any sort of empty seat, and sit in one right as the bell rings. The teacher then stands up and approaches the chalk board behind him.\n\n\"Alright class, it\u0027s time to review what we learned yesterday....\"\n\nHe begins, but you quickly lose interest in what he\u0027s teaching and look around the room in search for some familiarity. Not that you can really be blamed for not paying attention, as you\u0027ve listened to all this before anyway. That is, assuming you really have gone back in time, and this isn\u0027t all some weird dream.\n\nYou sigh softly, thoroughly confused at your current situation. Eventually, you spot a girl in the corner of the room that you seem to recognize. Or, rather than recognize, you should say you feel like you know her, for some reason or another. No name comes to mind, nor any memories involving her, but for some reason you still think she\u0027s someone you know.\n\nLong, black hair, with brown eyes, and a slim figure. What\u0027s most noticeable about her though, is her gothic outfit of all black, complete with a spiked dog collar, and black painted finger nails. Looking at her closer, you determine that her black hair is probably dyed, your guess being her originally hair colour is a light brown. You brood over how you may know her, and your predicament as a whole, until the class finally ends. As the goth girl leaves she seems to ignore you completely. Maybe you don\u0027t know her?\n","page 91":"As per usual, you and Ian walk to school together in the morning. He talks about his older brother, but by now you\u0027ve learned to just zone out while he\u0027s doing so. You have far more important things to think about anyway, such as how you\u0027re actually going to get Allison to go to the fair with you.\n\nNo, that\u0027s probably the wrong way of looking at it. The real hard part will be dealing with her being in love with you. Or having a crush on you. Or just really being into you. Truthfully you\u0027re not really sure which it is, but you\u0027ll need to settle that matter regardless. You do find Allison attractive, a thought that causes great conflicts within you, but you\u0027d feel like you\u0027re taking advantage of her if you pursued her that way.\n\nThinking about it further, you realize you still have no idea what her relation to you is either. After all, she clearly knew you before you met in class. The way she spoke to you and her avoidance of key questions made that clear, not to mention there\u0027s no way she\u0027d feel strongly about you if you just met.\n\nYou sigh as you enter the school, your thoughts becoming muddled. No matter which you decide to confront her on, the first step is to actually find and talk to her. A step greatly hindered by the fact that she isn\u0027t in your class when you enter. Confused, you approach the teacher.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nYou say, remembering you still have no idea what his name is.\n\n\"Um, is Allison sick or something?\"\n\nYou ask, pressing forward anyway. The teacher thinks for a moment then shakes his head.\n\n\"She hasn\u0027t called the school. It\u0027s odd, she transferred in near the end of the year, and she has skipped most of the lessons...\"\n\nHe replies pondering. The answer isn\u0027t exactly what you were expecting or what you wanted to hear, but you thank him anyway and head to your seat. The first period ends quickly, and you\u0027re left wondering how you should proceed with this situation.\n","page 93":"Monday morning comes, and as per usual you see Ian waiting for you outside your home, though he seems a bit less energetic than usual. Concerned, you inquire as to why.\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong, Ian?\"\n\n\"Hm? Nothing really.\"\n\nHe replies, shrugging off your concern. He then gets into a story involving his brother that you don\u0027t really care about. On the way to the school you think about how you should go about asking Olivia to the fair. Her having a boyfriend could be a problem. Well, could be a problem is a bit of an understatement. It definitely will be a problem, though you\u0027re sure that you can maybe get around that. Probably at least. Hopefully.\n\nThe two of you arrive at the school and go to your respective classes. You wait through the normal morning classes pondering further over how you should actually ask Olivia, occasionally shooting her glances during class, so that by the time lunch comes, you\u0027re fully convinced that you have no plan whatsoever.\n\nRegardless, you wait for her in the hall until she leaves the class.\n\n\"Hey, Olivia.\"\n\nYou say, greeting her as she leaves the class.\n\n\"Oh. Hi, Jacob.\"\n\nShe replies, oddly calm.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry I made you talk about your past earlier...\"\n\nShe says apologetically. You\u0027re not really sure why she thinks you\u0027d be upset about that, so you just shrug.\n\n\"No big deal, to make it up to me you can come with me to the fair on Saturday.\"\n\nYou reply with a grin, deciding to play off her guilt a little. She immediately looks at you with a bewildered expression.\n\n\"I...wait what? You\u0027re asking me to the fair?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nOlivia skeptically looks you up and down, as if trying to determine your motive. Deciding that could end badly, you intervene.\n\n\"Ah, don\u0027t worry, I just want to go as friends.\"\n\n\"Friends, huh...\"\n\nShe replies softly. Suddenly she perks up and smiles.\n\n\"Alright, we\u0027ll goes as friends then.\"\n\nShe says happily, much to your surprise. She then walks away from you towards the cafeteria, apparently ending the conversation. You watch her go and wonder why she agreed to it so easily, when you know she has a boyfriend.\n","page 92":"The next morning you wake up a bit earlier than usual. Intentionally of course, as you plan to do something that you know the you of the past would have never done. As you enter the living room and see your mother and sister, you announce your plans.\n\n\"Hey, Tina, I\u0027ll take you to school today.\"\n\nYou say, not even asking for a response. You still think it\u0027s rather pointless for your mother to drive her to a school that\u0027s only ten minutes away. Tina is in high school after all, she can walk the distance just fine. Even so, taking her there will be a good time to ask her to come with you to the fair, so you that\u0027s your plan.\n\n\"Are you sure, Jacob? Won\u0027t you be late for school?\"\n\nYour mother asks.\n\n\"Yeah I\u0027ll be fine.\"\n\nYou say, and that settles it. A few minutes later after you\u0027re both ready for school, you leave with Tina. The beginning of the walk is somewhat awkward, but you eventually start up a conversation.\n\n\"So, Tina, you heard about the fair right?\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"Did you want to go to it?\"\n\n\"...Sort of...\"\n\nTina replies hesitantly.\n\n\"Alright, I\u0027ll take you then.\"\n\nYou reply, undeterred. Tina looks at you, obviously surprised by this, but nods in response.\n\n\"Okay...\"\n\nShe timidly replies. The rest of your walk to her school is uneventful, but after dropping her off she makes a request.\n\n\"Will you pick me up again?\"\n\nTina asks. You ponder for a moment before nodding.\n\n\"Yeah sure.\"\n\nShe smiles and heads into her school, and you head to yours. You\u0027re starting to regret not spending more time with her growing up, but you can change that now. Besides, you\u0027re curious about those kids that pushed your sister around earlier.\n\nYou arrive at your school just slightly late, and after a small talk from your teacher, continue classes like normal. Oddly enough, Allison doesn\u0027t show up at the school until the second period, but you don\u0027t pay too much attention to her lateness.\n","page 95":"Realizing you have no idea where she could be anyway, you decide to just continue with your classes like normal. Allison has to return to school sometime, so you can just speak with her then.\n\nSure enough, in time for the start of your next class, Allison shows up. You don\u0027t really have a chance to speak with her during the class, but you can tell she seems pretty down. Not wanting to risk her leaving again before you get the chance to ask, you decide to slip her a note asking her to go to the fair with you. You can\u0027t think of a way to solve the other issues, so you\u0027ll just deal with them later.\n\nYou raise your hand to leave for the bathroom, and on your way out you pass by Allison\u0027s desk, dropping the note as you do. Out of the corner of your eye as you leave, you notice her open it. When the class ends, you approach her.\n\n\"So uh....do you have an answer?\"\n\nYou ask nervously. This whole scenario seems rather odd, but you can\u0027t help but feel like a high school boy asking out a girl. Allison gives you a short look and a nod. It seems like she\u0027s still upset over something though.\n\n\"You okay Allison?\"\n\nYou ask concerned. She nods again.\n\n\"I\u0027m just thinking about some things, I\u0027ll be fine in a bit.\"\n\nShe replies in a low voice, walking away. You frown, but can\u0027t think of anything else to say, so you leave it at that.\n","page 94":"Monday morning comes around, and as per usual Ian meets you in front of your house.\n\n\"Yo!\"\n\nHe says, greeting you with a wave, to which you wave back and begin walking with him.\n\n\"But yeah, apparently these guys got into an argument with my brother over turf. I don\u0027t really get why, but they\u0027ve been getting more threatening.\"\n\nIan says, explaining an event involving the wolves and some other gang. Since you\u0027re a member of the wolves now, you figure you should probably pay attention to these things.\n\n\"I thought you said this wasn\u0027t really a gang, Ian. What the hell did you drag me into?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean, it\u0027s not really a gang, but apparently some real gangs are thinking it is.\"\n\nHe replies, defensively. Well, you suppose if some fake gang went around calling themselves a gang, there may be issues.\n\n\"By the way...\"\n\nYou start, a bit reluctantly.\n\n\"What\u0027s um, your brother\u0027s name again?\"\n\n\"Hm? It\u0027s Peter.\"\n\n\"Ah right. You said I gotta meet with him to really become a wolf?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"So, in other words, I can avoid all of this if I don\u0027t meet him?\"\n\nYou say with a smirk.\n\n\"Dammit man! You already agreed.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. So, when am I meeting him?\"\n\n\"He should be there tomorrow, so then I suppose.\"\n\nIan replies. You\u0027re quite interested in what this gang is all about. At the very least, you need to find out if it\u0027s the reason why Ian never went to a college and became nothing more than a stock boy. You don\u0027t remember his brother well enough to decide his intentions for starting it. Come to think of it, you have no idea what happened to his brother in the future either.\n","page 97":"School ends and you met Ian as per usual at the front of school, however today you have something different in mind.\n\n\"Hey, Ian, I\u0027ll catch you later, I\u0027m going to go with Allison.\"\n\nYou tell him, spotting her down the hallway.

It\u0027s not like you\u0027re learning anything important anyway. You brazenly walk out the front doors of the school and head towards the park Allison took you to on Saturday; the only place you think she could be.\n\nThat is to say you start to head there, when you see Allison walking towards the school. Confused, but with your objective already achieved, you approach her. She notices you, and brings her gaze to the ground.\n\n\"Hey, Allison.\"\n\nYou say. Moments after the words leave your lips, you realize she seems off.\n\n\"You okay?\"\n\nYou ask in a concerned manner. Allison brings her eyes to yours briefly, before looking away and doing a small shuffle backwards.\n\n\"...I\u0027m fine...\"\n\nShe replies after a short silence.\n\n\"You don\u0027t seem fine...\"\n\nYou reply, fairly certain she\u0027s feeling nervous. Though, given your last meeting that\u0027s to be expected. Not being the best with words, you decide you can\u0027t apologize for this properly, so you move straight into your question.\n\n\"So, uh, I was wondering if you wanted to go to the fair with me...\"\n\nYou say, unconfidently with a small blush. Allison looks up at you, and for the first time you notice her eyes are bright blue. She stares at you expressionless for a second, before smiling.\n\n\"Yeah, that\u0027s just like you.\"\n\nShe says happily with a giggle, her mood changing completely.\n\n\"Yep, this is fine.

You alright?\"\n\nIan asks, concerned, as he helps you up. You press your hand against your face and grimace at the pain.\n\n\"Yeah, that\u0027s gonna leave a mark.\"\n\nHe remarks. Suddenly something in you clicks. This must be why you had a black eye at the fair, since the fair is technically tomorrow. Your guess is, this is what Allison meant when she mentioned your sense of time might get messed up.\n\n\"Anyway...why are you here?\"\n\nIan asks.\n\n\"I mean, how do you even know about this place? About the Wolves?\"\n\nHe asks. You ponder over how you should actually answer these questions. You rather doubt he\u0027d accept that you\u0027re traveling through time and these are all memories of other times you traveled through time. Come to think of it, you\u0027re not even sure yourself how this really is working. As you think, Ian\u0027s brother Peter approaches.\n\n\"You must be Jacob.\"\n\nHe says. You nod, indicating he\u0027s correct.\n\n\"You serious about joining the Wolves?\"\n\nHe asks in a firm tone. You look from Ian, to the others in the room. You feel like you really should join the Wolves, even if you just mentioned it in the spur of the moment.\n\n\"Yeah, I am.\"\n\nYou reply. Peter seems to consider this briefly, before extending his hand.\n\n\"Well, I gotta say. You got amazing timing, and you somehow knew about the rest of the Wolves. I think it\u0027s safe to say we can trust you. You\u0027re in.\"\n\nHe replies, welcoming you. You shake his hand, then return your attention to Ian.\n\n\"Ian, I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ve been a pretty shitty friend till now.\"\n\nYou say, confessing your feelings.\n\n\"No worries man, you don\u0027t need to worry about being friends anymore.\"\n\nHe says, confusing you.\n\n\"We\u0027re family now that you\u0027re in the Wolves, after all. I\u0027m glad you finally agreed to come.\"\n\nIan says, patting you on the shoulder. You remember the times he tried to convince you to come with him to here, or to at least listen to him talk about the place, but you had always ignored it.\n\n\"Suppose we are.\"\n\nYou reply. Suddenly you remember how he showed up at the fair.\n\n\"By the way, tomorrow I need you to help me with Tina.\"\n\nYou say, as you begin your explanation about how he should show up at the forest outside the fair, and to bring his bat.\n\n\"Sure thing man.\"\n\nHe replies. You smile, happy he agreed, when suddenly you hear that familiar \u0027pop\u0027 again, and everything goes dark.\n","page 270":"That\u0027s right, before when you interfered with the fight, you really got the shit kicked out of you. Reflecting on how everything happened, you determine that if the rest of the gang had been present, you probably could have avoided a fight all together. You can make it. You can gather them all in time. With that, you rush towards the \u0027Wolf den\u0027. You know that the other members are probably on their way to their jobs now, and their jobs are all near the old abandoned building.\n\nYou arrive with enough time, but the other members take a bit of convincing to come with you. After all, they have no idea who you are right now, since you\u0027re only knowledge of them is from memories of other times this has happened. Eventually, you convince them to at least come with you, and the group of four agree. With the Wolves gathered, you sprint towards the abandoned building, where you know Ian and Peter will be involved in a fight any minute now.\n\nThe four and you all arrive at the \u0027Wolf den\u0027, which seems to be empty. Knowing this isn\u0027t really the case, you run through it, going down hallways until you finally reach a familiar back room. Bursting through it, you see the four members of the opposing game you expected to see, the three guys and a girl. Inside the room is also a surprised Ian and Peter. A moment of awkward silence occurs, as the other four Wolves finally catch up with you. With your back up finally arrived, you smile at Ian and Peter.\n\n\"Sup guys, I\u0027d like to join the wolves.\"\n\nYou say with a large grin. You then turn to the four people of the opposing gang.\n\n\"You\u0027re outnumbered now. Get the fuck out and don\u0027t come back.\"\n\nYou order, trying to sound as intimidating as possible. As you speak, you see Peter reach into his back pocket, and a flash of memories tells you that is where he keeps the knife he used to kill one of these guys before. The biggest guy in the opposing gang, who is clearly the leader, looks back and forth between everyone else in the room, before laughing.\n\n\"Hahaha! Well, I suppose we\u0027ll just have to go then.\"\n\nHe replies with a grin. Something about this doesn\u0027t seem quite right though. Just as he\u0027s about to pass you, he stops.\n\n\"Just one thing though.\"\n\nHe says, suddenly punching you in the eye. The unexpected punch sends you to the floor, and causes you to groan in pain.\n\n\"You can keep this shitty building, but don\u0027t think for a second you\u0027ll intimidate us.\"\n\nHe says, walking away, with the rest of his gang following him. The rest of the Wolves simply watch as he leaves. You can\u0027t really blame them though, you\u0027re a complete stranger to them after all. As they leave, Ian rushes up to you.\n","page 152":"After laying on your bed a few minutes, you wake up to find it\u0027s already the morning. Deciding there\u0027s no point in dwelling on the past, you get out of bed and get ready for school. Whatever happened before doesn\u0027t matter, you decide what happens this time after all. With that in mind, you head downstairs and meet up with Tina, taking her to school again. You still feel irritated around her for some reason, but you decide to just ignore the feeling.\n\nYour classes pass without anything of interest really happening. You see Allison again, but she doesn\u0027t seem to make any effort to approach you for some reason, so you decide to initiate conversation yourself.\n\n\"Hey Allison, what\u0027s wrong?\"\n\nYou ask her during lunch, ditching Ian for a few minutes. Allison frowns and gives a soft sigh.\n\n\"Nothing really. I\u0027m just wondering if this will ever end.\"\n\n\"If what will ever end?\"\n\nYou ask confused. Allison appears to be saying weird things again. She sighs again.\n\n\"It\u0027s nothing. Don\u0027t worry about it. By the way, how are things with your sister?\"\n\n\"With Tina? Fine, why?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that\u0027s what I thought.\"\n\nAllison responds, oddly disappointed.\n\n\"What, is there something wrong with me getting along with my sister?\"\n\nYou ask, a bit defensive.\n\n\"No, if that was actually the case it\u0027d be great.\"\n\nShe replies disinterested.\n\n\"Anyway, I need to go now, see you another time, Jacob.\"\n\nAllison says with a short, unenthusiastic wave, walking away. You frown as she does, confused as to what her problem is, but go back to eating lunch with Ian.\n\nThe next few days pass, and Allison oddly enough doesn\u0027t show up at school. You follow your routine of bringing Tina to and from school, luckily with those suspicious classmates of hers not trying anything. Eventually, Saturday comes, and with it the fair arrives.\n","page 273":"Suddenly, you find yourself standing in the same park Allison left you at, with Allison standing right in front of you, a big smile on her face.\n\n\"You did it!\"\n\nShe exclaims, jumping into you and giving you a large hug. You hear her give a huge sigh of relief.\n\n\"It\u0027s finally over.\"\n\nShe says. She\u0027s right, whatever it is she wanted you to do, it seems to finally be over. But you can\u0027t feel all that happily or proud about it. You push Allison back gently, and look away from her.\n\n\"I\u0027m...a terrible person.\"\n\nYou say in dismay, reflecting on everything that has happened. Even if you went back and changed it all, you still were the cause of pain and suffering for everyone that you cared about. Before you know it, you\u0027ve begun crying. This whole experience has been one large emotional roller coaster for you. You feel Allison\u0027s hand gently touch your cheek, as she moves your face and makes you look into her eyes. Somehow, her doing this makes you feel at ease, and the tears stop. She gives a slow shake of her head, before stepping back.\n\n\"You\u0027re wrong. You\u0027re not a terrible person. Everyone does things they aren\u0027t proud of, it\u0027s just you could never get over it. Even now, even after you\u0027ve made everything right, you still feel guilty.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"I think it\u0027s time I tell you a very important story. Our story.\"\n","page 151":"That\u0027s right, you hate her. Ever since she caused you to move away to another city, away from all your friends, just so she could go to some fancy private school. A private school you couldn\u0027t even go to, because you weren\u0027t smart enough. It\u0027s only natural you would hate her after that. You lost everything you had cared about, so she could have what she wanted.\n\nYou not being accepted into the same school was the first time in your life you felt failure, real failure. It wasn\u0027t like you failed some test that didn\u0027t really matter, you had failed to prove you were worthwhile. Failed to prove that you were just as good as she was. You were jealous of her. What\u0027s worse, is that event pushed you into a downwards spiral.\n\nBeing only twelve years old at the time, you couldn\u0027t control your emotions, so you became violent. You constantly got into fights, and ended up being expelled from a couple of schools in that city. Not that you cared. You had lost the will to care about school. So, you took your anger out on whatever you could.\n\nAnd it was all her fault. She caused you to become like that. No, she even caused you to become who you are now. The person who achieved nothing but becoming a stock boy later in life. A person without dreams or ambitions. It\u0027s all her fault. Everything would have been better had she not gone to that private school. Everything would have been better had you not experienced that immense sense of loss. Everything would have been better had she just never existed...\n\nYou take a deep breath while laying on your bed, as you come to terms with your feelings. You hate your own sister. While you can\u0027t shake the feeling away, you feel sick knowing that\u0027s how you really feel about her. What\u0027s worse, is that she seems to be well aware of it. How can you forgive her for ruining your life? Do you even want to forgive her? Does she even deserve it?\n","page 272":"Suddenly, you find yourself standing in the park again, in front of a rather annoyed looking Allison. She glares at you silently, and just as you\u0027re about to speak, interrupts you.\n\n\"Dammit Jacob!\"\n\nShe yells.\n\n\"We\u0027re so close!\"\n\nShe continues.\n\n\"What do you mean? I fixed everything didn\u0027t I?\"\n\n\"No, you didn\u0027t. And now you\u0027re going to try again.\"\n\n\"You can do that?\"\n\n\"Of course I can. Do you know how many times I\u0027ve looped through time in order to get to this point?\"\n\nShe snaps. Clearly Allison is a bit upset at you for screwing up, though you\u0027re not really sure how you screwed up.\n\n\"Alright, alright. I\u0027ll try again.\"\n\nYou say, reassuring her. Her anger doesn\u0027t seem to subside much, but she does walk closer to you.\n\n\"You better!\"\n\nShe says in a commanding tone. Then her voice goes softer.\n\n\"Good luck, Jacob...\"\n\nShe says, tapping a button on the bracelet as she reaches you. Before you\u0027re able to reply, you hear a \u0027pop\u0027 noise, and everything goes dark.\n","page 154":"\"How did you even get into my house?\"\n\nYou ask in disbelief.\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t matter. Why are you just laying around in bed?\"\n\nAllison answers, pointing accusingly at you. You hardly even know Allison, yet here she is, somehow in your room. You grip a hold of your covers and pull them closer to you. There\u0027s no way you want to tell her that you hate your own sister.\n\n\"I\u0027m sick. Leave me alone.\"\n\nYou respond, pulling your covers over you and laying back down. You hear Allison click her tongue, and suddenly feel a sharp pain in your side.\n\n\"Ow! Why the hell did you just kick me?\"\n\nYou ask angrily, as Allison pulls back her leg.\n\n\"You\u0027re not sick.\"\n\n\"Yes I am.\"\n\n\"No you\u0027re not.\"\n\n\"Just leave already.\"\n\n\"STOP RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS!\"\n\nAllison suddenly yells. She then puts on foot on your bed and looks down at you, her breathing becoming heavier. She\u0027s clearly really upset with you.\n\n\"I\u0027m not...\"\n\nYou reply in an unconvincing manner.\n\n\"Is that so? Then tell me, how do you feel about your sister?\"\n\nAllison asks accusingly. The question comes as a huge shock to you. How does she even know this is about Tina? Why does she care?\n\n\"Why do yo-\"\n\n\"JUST ANSWER ME!\"\n\nShe screams, interrupting you. Allison is really getting emotional over this for some reason. You should give her an answer, if only to make her go away.\n","page 275":"\"Once upon a time.\"\n\nAllison begins.\n\n\"There was a girl. She was pretty, and smart, and elegant, and determined-\"\n\n\"And full of herself.\"\n\nYou interrupt with a grin. Allison smiles sweetly, then continues.\n\n\"Yes, she wasn\u0027t all perfect. She had her arrogant side, and many people thought she was rather odd.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"But then she met a boy. The boy was rude, emotional, unmotivated, and seemed to do nothing but wallow in his own self-pity.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"That\u0027s harsh.\"\n\nYou remark, and Allison smiles again.\n\n\"It is. Don\u0027t worry though, the boy also had a sweet side to him, and being emotional isn\u0027t always a bad thing. The girl met the boy, and as with all love stories, they fell in love. After some years together they vowed to stay together forever, and the girl really believed this would be the case...\"\n\nAllison says.\n\n\"But the boy had a past he couldn\u0027t escape, and he had done things he couldn\u0027t forgive himself for. Over time, he slowly realized the kind of person he had been, and how the choices he made, or didn\u0027t make, led to others suffering too.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"Of course, this wasn\u0027t really the case. Even if he played a part in it, it was hardly all his fault. But, he could never forgive himself, and years after vowing to spend the rest of their lives together, that vow was broken. The boy gave no notice, and the only thing he left behind, was a small note.\"\n\nAllison says. She then takes a deep breath, and continues.\n\n\"\u0027I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m a terrible person.\u0027, is what the note said. I\u0027m sure you can guess how this made the girl feel. The person who she loved more than anything, couldn\u0027t even love himself. But the girl was stubborn. She refused to let it end that way. She was always a sucker for fairytales, and she felt this sort of ending for the two of them was just too cruel.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"So, she dedicated the rest of her life to her job. She wasn\u0027t just smart, she was one of the smartest people to ever grace this earth. So smart, that after years of research, she accomplished her final goal.\"\n\nAllison says, reaching towards your wrist and the bracelet.\n\n\"Time travel. The girl would go back in time, and fix everything herself.\"\n\nShe says, unclipping the bracelet.\n\n\"But, time travel was more complicated than she had anticipated, and even when she solved all of the problems herself, she could never save the boy. The boy would always feel guilty. Even if the problems of the others were solved, he still felt bad for the part he played in them. So the girl tried again. And again. And again. And again...\"\n\nAllison says, trailing off.\n\n\"But, no matter how much she tried, the end was always the same. The boy she loved so much, seemed absolutely determined to hate himself until the very end. She began to doubt herself, and wonder if this was simply his fate. That the two of them were doomed to have the same tragic end, again and again.\"\n\nShe continues.\n\n\"But, with each time she tried, she grew to love the boy even more, so there was no way she could give up. She also noticed that the boy seemed to remember times they had together, even if it was in a different timeline. In fact, the boy began to claim he himself was also going back in time. Such a thing was a far cry from what the girl expected, and it appeared as though time travel was more complex than she realized. So, the girl thought about it long and hard, and decided. The only way for her to save the boy, would be to have him save himself. She could help guide him, but he would have to come to all of the realizations himself. She would help him, no matter how many times it took.\"\n\nAllison says, and with that you sense the end to her story.\n\n\"Jacob, the reason I wanted you to think about what you want to do with your life, is because you need to want to do something for this to work. You need to forgive yourself, and you need to move forward.\"\n\nShe says, explaining her past motive. You take a moment to absorb everything Allison has said to you. This girl went back in time, more times than she could count, all for you. You don\u0027t even have the right to hate yourself if someone that loves you this much exists.\n\n\"Thank you...\"\n\nYou reply, after a long silence. Allison slowly extends her arms towards you, and hugs you. You hugs her backing, appreciating her warmth. You feel like everything is finally over, and give a relieved sigh.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n\nYou hear Allison whisper in your ears. Confused, you back out of the hug, and look at Allison, who has yet again begun to cry.\n","page 153":"The next morning you find yourself lying in your bed, with no motivation at all to get up and go to classes. You\u0027re sick, not so much physically, but emotionally you\u0027re drained. You can\u0027t face Tina, and you don\u0027t even care about school, so you just lay in bed.\n\nYour mother knocks on your door and asks what\u0027s wrong, and you simply tell her you\u0027re sick and not going to school today.\n\n\"So, then you\u0027re not going to bring your sister to school and pick her up?\"\n\nShe innocently asks through your door. You thank the fact she can\u0027t see that you just cringed at her question. Why would you want anything to do with the person who ruined you life. The girl you can\u0027t even stand to look at.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nIs all you say in response. Your mother tells you she\u0027ll call the school and take of your sister in that case, then leaves.\n\nThe rest of the day passes, and you barely leave your bed. Once she returns home, your mother takes your temperature and asks some questions about your health. Even after she determines you have nothing physically wrong with you, you insist you\u0027re sick. Your mother is a caring person at heart, so she takes the hint and leaves you be.\n\nYou don\u0027t want to face Tina. You\u0027ll have to leave your room eventually, but you can still avoid Tina until high school is finished, then you can leave this house as soon as possible. Thinking back, that\u0027s exactly what you did in the past. You avoided your sister, and as soon as you could, left your house.\n\nWhat else could I have done...\n\nYou think to yourself. The day ends and Thursday arrives. The morning passes similar to the day before, and soon enough you\u0027re left alone in your house. You get a few hours of peace and silence, before your room door suddenly swings open.\n\n\"A...Allison?!\"\n\nYou say in disbelief, immediately sitting up in your bed. In the frame of your door stands Allison, clearly upset.\n\n\"So you were here. What the hell are you doing?\"\n\nShe asks angrily.\n","page 274":"You hear a light ringing noise in your head, as you begin to regain consciousness. Soon, the noise dissipates, and you hear someone talking instead. Forcing your eyes open, you see you\u0027re in the middle of a classroom. At least you think you are, as your vision is far too blurry to see anything properly. The voice continues to say something, and suddenly you recognize this as your classroom. Blinking a few times, your vision clears, your hearing returns, and you confirm that this is your classroom. You glance around the room, and notice Olivia sitting in her usual chair.\n\nAnd suddenly wave upon wave of memories flood through your mind.\n\nYou remember how you used to be friends. You remember how you left, without even getting the chance to say goodbye. Various memories of your past together overwhelm you for several minutes, and by the end of it you\u0027re practically in tears.\n\nNot only did you leave her, but you forgot about her as well. Worst still, flashes of memory from when you first came back to this city, where she seemed happy to see you, and where you ignored her, also come to the forefront of your mind. Not only did you forget about her, but she remembered you. She\u0027s had to deal with her best friend from childhood, completely forgetting about her, and ignoring her for almost a year now. You can\u0027t stand this. You\u0027re such a terrible person to have done this to her. It doesn\u0027t matter that she changed her hair colour, or that she wear different clothing now, she still is the spitting image of her past self.\n\nAnd you forgot about her.\n\nSuddenly, another, more terrifying memory goes through you. You remember being on a bridge with her, and her wanting to end her life. The pain and suffering she went through alone, and the guilt you felt then and now after remembering it, is almost too much to bear. The only redeeming factor here is that you can fix everything without having to reach the stage where the two of you are at the bridge.\n\nWith all your effort going towards keeping it together, you don\u0027t even notice the class end, and Olivia walk right past you. Suddenly, you understand what Allison meant when she said you\u0027d know what to do. You have to talk to Olivia. You have to tell her how you feel, and to set this right. You can\u0027t change what you\u0027ve already done, but you can mend your friendship with her. With that in mind, you wipe the tears from your face, and rush out the room. You run right past Olivia, and stop in front of her, blocking her path.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nShe asks in an annoyed tone, narrowing her eyes.\n","page 134":"You\u0027re not sure why you always think you\u0027ll be able to find her at the park. It\u0027s probably because the park is where you first really got to know her, or maybe it hold some sort of deeper meaning from the past, and you just intuitively know. Regardless, it seems like all your searches for Allison always lead you there.\n\nYou enter the park, and much to your surprise, Allison is actually there, sitting alone on one of the swings at the swing set. It\u0027s during the middle of the day, so everyone else is at school, making the park empty apart from you and her. Her eyes are facing the ground, and she\u0027s gently pushing herself back and forth. You go to approach her, when you remember how she ran away the last time the two of you talked. You stand still, silently staring at her for a few minutes, as you think of a plan to ensure she can\u0027t leave without answer you. The park is wide open, meaning that if she really wanted to, she could run away in any number of directions. You could block off one escape route just fine, but there\u0027s no way you could completely-\n\n\"ALLISON!\"\n\nYou find yourself yelling to her mid-thought. Allison immediately perks up and looks at you. It seems your emotions are all over the place, and you can\u0027t even think properly. You should probably ask her why-\n\n\"I LOVE YOU!\"\n\nI love her?\n\nYou find yourself yelling. You\u0027re not even sure why at this point, but your emotions take over, and you continue yelling.\n\n\"I LOVE YOU, SO PLEASE, JUST TELL ME WHAT\u0027S GOING ON!\"\n\nYou yell, as Allison clenches onto the chains of her swing.\n\n\"WHY?...why?...\"\n\nYou say, your loud voice being reduced to a mumble in frustration. The questions you want to ask her flow through your unstable mind. Why did she run from you? Why do you love her? What does she mean she\u0027s jumping through time? Who is she? Why do you love her? Why do you love her? Why did you just say you love her?\n\nYou avert your eyes from her and stare at the ground. You really just said you love her. It\u0027s the first time you\u0027ve ever said that to anyone. When was is that you started feeling like this? How can you love her when you barely know her? You\u0027ve forgotten the reason you originally came here, so you stand in silence, before two arms wrap around you.\n\nThe silence continues as your mind realizes that Allison just hugged you. It\u0027s also at this point that you realize you\u0027re crying, and that you\u0027ve been crying since you started yelling. What the hell is wrong with you? You\u0027re such a mess right now.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...\"\n\nAllison whispers.\n\n\"We should talk.\"\n\nShe says, ending the hug and backing away from you.

You look at the bracelet, then back to her.\n\n\"That sounds hard, can\u0027t we just kiss again?\"\n\nYou ask with a grin. Allison laughs wholeheartedly, before answering you.\n\n\"Dammit, Jacob! Focus!\"\n\nShe says, attempting to sound firm, but laughing as she speaks. You nod and motion your hand to indicate your zipping your lips.\n\n\"Good! I can\u0027t tell you much more than this: You\u0027ll know exactly what you need to do when you jump through time. I\u0027d tell you more, but, well, you kind of need to do it yourself.\"\n\nAllison explains.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"You\u0027ll find out after. Oh, and another thing. Memories are going to be flooding your head faster than you can really interpret, so just try and focus.\"\n\nShe continues.\n\n\"Also, since you\u0027re jumping through time so quickly, your sense of time might get, well, distorted. Just roll with it.\"\n\nAllison says.\n\n\"Is time travel really so fickle?\"\n\nYou ask skeptically, glancing at the bracelet on your wrist. Looking at it now, it really does look more like a machine than a bracelet. There\u0027s a touch screen on the front of it, and you can see the current date and time down to the second. Odd wires and metal things seem to stick out of it in seemingly randomly places. Allison notices you looking at the bracelet, and tries to draw you attention away from it.\n\n\"Focus, Jacob! You\u0027ll arrive back here once you accomplish everything. Well, it\u0027ll actually be this Sunday by the time you\u0027re back.

Allison seems to ignore your doubts, as she grabs a hold of your wrist and begins tapping on the screen of your bracelet. After a few moments, she backs away again, and you see that she has yet again started to cry.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...\"\n\nShe says, wiping her face.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry...everything will make sense...once you start. In a way...you\u0027ve already done it before.\"\n\nAllison says, in between sniffles and her tears. You still have no idea what\u0027s going on, but you hate seeing her cry like this. You begin to reach out to her, when she says one last thing.\n\n\"Good luck...I love you.\"\n\nYou hear her say. Then suddenly you hear a loud \u0027pop\u0027, and everything goes dark.\n","page 136":"You\u0027re left alone with your thoughts, reflecting on what just happened. You love Allison, and Allison loves you. Furthermore, you\u0027ve both gone back through time, and by the sounds of it, it\u0027s happened several times before, and you just don\u0027t remember as well as Allison. How and why remains to be seen, but knowing Allison, it probably has something to do with the answer to her question that she left you.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nLike you\u0027d know what you want. That\u0027s such a vague question it\u0027s almost unfair for her to ask. You never thought about what you really wanted before. After all, you had basically given up on achieving anything, and with that comes a lack of desire for, well, anything really. Sure at some point you probably had a dream, an ambition, or anything really. Everyone has one at some point. But, yours is long forgotten. You, without skills, without direction, without desire, simply had intended on living until you died.\n\nYou sigh and sit on a swing, gently rocking yourself back and forth. Is there even a right answer to her question? If you give her an answer, would she disagree with it if it was wrong or different from what she thought it should be? It\u0027s possible she already knows the right answer, and is just waiting for you to realize it.\n\nYou close your eyes and look deep within yourself to try and find an answer, but nothing comes.\n\nIt\u0027s hopeless.\n\nYou think to yourself. You\u0027ve long since lost what you wanted to do, assuming you ever wanted to do anything to begin with. You can\u0027t even remember a time when you had an ambition. You sigh again and lean back on the swing.\n\nIt\u0027s pointless.\n\nYou won\u0027t be able to think of anything. It\u0027s so unreasonable of Allison to give you such a tough question and only a day to answer her. Why just a day? Why can\u0027t she give you longer? Why can\u0027t she just help you?\n\nIt\u0027s hopeless, but...\n\nYou need to think of an answer. Somehow you know you do.\n\nIt\u0027s pointless, but...\n\nYou can find a way. Even if it\u0027s not yours alone, you can find a way, you convince yourself, standing up. If it\u0027s hopeless and pointless to think about it alone, then you just need to ask for another opinion. With that in mind, you return to the school, to see Ian.\n","page 257":"\"I love you!\"\n\nYou say confidently to Olivia, in the middle of the crowded hallway. Olivia stares blankly at you for a moment, taking in what you just said, before suddenly blushing.\n\n\"Y-y-you what?\"\n\n\"I love you, Olivia! I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t tell you until now!\"\n\nYou continue. For some reason, you think telling her you love her is the right this to do. Though, you question if you really do love her. After all, you love Allison don\u0027t you? Olivia now begins to back away from you slowly.\n\n\"Jacob...wh-what are you talking about?\"\n\nShe asks with a red face and a stutter.\n\n\"Where is this even coming from?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m not sure, but this feels like the right thing to do.\"\n\nOlivia glances around the hallway, noticing that the two of you are the center of attention.\n\n\"I...I have a boyfriend!\"\n\nShe yells, quickly turning around and sprinting down the hall. You watch her, curious as to why she had such an odd reaction. Before you get a chance to reflect too much on it, you hear a familiar \u0027pop\u0027, and everything goes dark again.\n","page 135":"Despite saying she wanted the talk, the two of you sit silently for several minutes before she says anything. That\u0027s for the better though, since that\u0027s about how long it took for you to steady yourself. Your tears have stopped, and you\u0027ve regained your sanity again. You really do love Allison. You\u0027re still confused as to the why and how, but that fact remains true.\n\n\"That\u0027s...the first time you\u0027ve said that to anyone, right?\"\n\nAllison asks, turning to you. You nod silently, embarrassed.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry...\"\n\nShe says, leaning towards you awkwardly on her swing. You wonder what she\u0027s about to do, when she leans further and kisses your lips. She breaks off the kiss after a moment, and smiles.\n\n\"Cause I love you too. None of this ever would have happened if I didn\u0027t after all.\"\n\nYou stare blankly at her. The kiss along with her confession together makes a fatal combo which completely pacifies you.\n\n\"I suppose I owe you an explanation now though...\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"For starters, don\u0027t worry about you going back in time ten years. I\u0027ve spent far longer than that going through time, so it\u0027s not like you\u0027re taking advantage of a young girl by kissing me.\"\n\nShe explains, precisely ending your largest reservation.\n\n\"Also, I\u0027m afraid you going back in time is my fault. See, I was the one who originally went back in time. It seems time and time travel isn\u0027t so simple though. Our connection lead to you inadvertently coming back as well. Ah, that\u0027s right, in the future we\u0027re together. If you\u0027re confused as to why you love me, it\u0027s because your memories and emotions towards me from the future still exist within you, even if you can\u0027t really recall them.\"\n\nShe say, continuing her explanation. Allison seems to know exactly what you want to know, without you even asking.\n\n\"If you\u0027re wondering how I know what you want to hear, it\u0027s because I\u0027ve said this before to you, in another cycle.\"\n\nShe says, immediately answering your thought.\n\n\"That difference between you and I going back in time, is I remember every iteration, whereas you for the most part forget it. Our connection allows for the memories and feelings to still exist, but it\u0027s so deep within you that you can\u0027t actively recall it.\"\n\nShe says, explaining even more things.\n\n\"I suppose I should stop my explanation there. It\u0027s a lot to take in, I know.\"\n\nAllison finishes. You nod, silently thanking her for ending her explanation. So, Allison really went back in time, and that\u0027s connected with you going back as well. You love Allison because you are together with her in the future, and love her there. You take solace in knowing you didn\u0027t fall in love with a girl within a week of knowing her, but there are still things left unanswered.\n\nWhy did she go back in time to begin with? If you going back in time with her was because you were together with her, why did you go back before you even met her? After all, ten years in the future you were still very much single. As you think about these things, Allison stands up. You immediately stand as well, but she holds her hand up.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll be at the school tomorrow like normal. I want you to think of something until then though...\"\n\nAllison says.\n\n\"What do you want? What is it that Jacob Tempus desires?\"\n\nYou frown in confusion.\n\n\"What do you mean what do I want?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"I mean exactly what I\u0027m asking. When you grow up, what do you hope to be? What do you want to have accomplished?\"\n\n\"Why does that matter?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s important, Jacob. Just think about it for me.\"\n\nAllison answers, as she leaves the park.\n","page 256":"\"I\u0027m sorry...Olivia.\"\n\nYou say quietly. Olivia\u0027s glare becomes softer, but she doesn\u0027t say anything back.\n\n\"I remember you now. We were friends, best friends, when we were younger. Yet...\"\n\nYou begin, attempting to hold your emotions in. Olivia\u0027s expression changes completely, as she realizes that you really remember her now. You see tears start to form by her eyes, and she quickly brings her hand to her mouth.\n\n\"Yet I did something terrible. I really did forget you...I forgot everything...\"\n\nYou continue, tears beginning to form in your eyes as well.\n\n\"So, I\u0027m sorry. I know I can\u0027t take back what I did, but I really am sorry.\"\n\nYou say, completely breaking down into tears. Olivia joins you, as the two of you begin to cry in the middle of the hallway. Most of the other students seem to have the sense to quickly walk away, so you have some sense of privacy. Once they\u0027re gone, Olivia practically jumps into you, and wraps her arms around you.\n\n\"So, Olivia. One more time, let\u0027s be friends.\"\n\nYou manage to get out. With her head in your chest, you feel her head move up and down, which you take to mean she says yes. You stand there hugging and crying for what seems like forever, before the two of you break apart. You awkwardly smile at each other, then suddenly you hear a familiar \u0027pop\u0027, and everything goes dark.\n","page 138":"Once you return home, you do something you know the past you never did. You ask your mother for advice. You don\u0027t even remember what her job right now is, but surely she can tell you something useful.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry Jacob, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you there.\"\n\nShe replies, crushing your hope that she could help.\n\n\"Only you can figure out what you want to do. If I, or someone else told you, then it wouldn\u0027t really be what you wanted to do, now would it?\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re thinking about it though, even if it is quite late.\"\n\nYour mother finishes, leaving you alone in the living room. You lay down on the sofa and stare at the ceiling, as if that would somehow lead you to an answer.\n\nIt\u0027s hopeless.\n\nYou begin to think again. You\u0027re just too far gone at this point.\n\nIt\u0027s pointless.\n\nWhat use is there in even figuring it out at this point? It\u0027s not like you can suddenly accomplish it.\n\n\"That\u0027s right, it\u0027d take lots of effort to do what I want to do...\"\n\nYou think out loud. Convincing yourself, you forget about the issue, and decide to tell Allison you can\u0027t think of an answer tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow comes, and you see Allison on your way to the school with Ian. As the two of you approach her, Ian goes on ahead, leaving the two of you alone.\n\n\"So, have an answer?\"\n\nAllison asks, getting right to the point. Maybe if you tell her you\u0027re stuck, she can help you.\n","page 259":"You slowly gain conscious again, and as you do you realize you\u0027re laying in your bed at your house. You groan as you sit up, thinking about what just happened. You still can hardly believe that Olivia is your old friend, and apologizing to her almost seems like a dream. Shaking your head, you roll off of your bed.\n\nAnd promptly fall onto the floor.\n\nTaking a moment to orient yourself, you slowly sit up again on the floor. Suddenly, you feel like you have a massive headache. Is this just a side-effect of time travel? Remembering that you have something you need to do, you quickly stumble out of your room, and head towards the front door. Oddly enough, you\u0027re already dressed and everything. It must be close to night time by now. On your way there, you run into your mother, who gives you a look of concern.\n\n\"All you alright, Jacob? Is your eye any better?\"\n\n\"My eye?\"\n\nYou ask confused, unconsciously putting your hand on your eye, which you instantly regret, as a rush of pain occurs when you touch it. Your mother seems to cringe as you do so.\n\n\"Yes, your eye. You came home with a black eye yesterday.\"\n\nShe explains.\n\n\"Something about a fight.\"\n\nAnd as soon as the words \u0027a fight\u0027, leave your mother\u0027s mouth, a flood of memories rushes into your mind, just like with Olivia. This time, memories of your sister, Tina, flow through you. Unable to take the strain, you fall to the ground, bracing yourself with your hands as you do.\n\n\"Jacob?\"\n\nYour mother asks, concerned. You ignore her, instead trying to make sense of the memories. You see all the times you ignored Tina, you remember the contempt you felt towards her, and you even feel the jealously sweep through you. That\u0027s right, you hated your sister. Your entire life, you\u0027ve hated her. Looking into all those memories, you see how completely unwarranted that hate really was. It wasn\u0027t her fault you moved away, it wasn\u0027t her fault you failed, and it wasn\u0027t her fault you stopped trying, yet you pushed all the blame and responsibility onto her.\n\nAnd as a result, she failed. A memory of her coming home, being beat up, and exclaiming she was quitting school comes to mind. You remember how you didn\u0027t care. No, in fact, you remember you were happy. You were glad to see her fail like that. A sickening feeling engulfs you, as you come to terms with how you acted to your sister.\n\nI\u0027m a terrible person.\n\nYou\u0027re upset at yourself, but something tells you that you don\u0027t have time to sit here. Another memory comes to mind, as you see yourself with Tina, and several other people, in a forest just outside the fair. You stand up and whip your forehead, now seeing that you had actually broken a cold sweat. Your mother, who was previously kneeling beside you, stands as well.\n\n\"Where\u0027s Tina?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"The fair, I believe.\"\n\nYour mother response. You should have expected that though. Allison would have sent you to a time when you could actually do something, you think. Come to think of it, you\u0027ve jumped ahead a few days by now, haven\u0027t you? You wonder what happened over those few days, as you grab a baseball bat, and quickly run out of your house.\n","page 137":"By the time you reach the school, it\u0027s about half-way through the fourth period. Deciding you shouldn\u0027t interrupt the class, you wait at the front of the school for Ian, continuing to think about Allison\u0027s question while you do. You hear the final bell ring, and shortly after see Ian approach you.\n\n\"Hey man, you find Allison?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she\u0027s fine...\"\n\nYou say, blushing slightly as you remember your confession and kiss with Allison.\n\n\"I got a question for you though.\"\n\n\"A question? Sure, what\u0027s up?\"\n\nIan says, choosing to ignore your blush in lieu of the question. You take a deep breath, and ask him.\n\n\"What do you want to do with your life?\"\n\nYou ask. Ian finishes gathering his stuff and the two of you exit the school.\n\n\"Man, that\u0027s a pretty deep question.\"\n\nHe says, pondering.\n\n\"I suppose I want to be a doctor though. I just need to score well on all my finals and I basically have a scholarship for it all.\"\n\nIan answers. You\u0027re somewhat frustrated and jealous he was able to answer you so easily.\n\n\"Why\u0027d you ask?\"\n\nHe asks.\n\n\"Ah, well I was just thinking about what I want to do, but nothing really came to mind.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you never did seem like you had any direction in life haha.\"\n\nIan carelessly responds. The answer is like a knife to your chest, but it\u0027s all true. You can\u0027t refute him or be mad at him giving you the honest truth.\n\n\"It\u0027s good you\u0027re thinking about it though, we\u0027re graduating soon after all.\"\n\n\"Yeah...I don\u0027t think I have the marks to accomplish anything that great anyway though.\"\n\nYou respond, realizing the hopelessness of the situation. That\u0027s right, even if you can think of what you want, it\u0027s far too late to try now isn\u0027t it. At this, Ian smacks the back of your head.\n\n\"What the hell, man?\"\n\n\"Grow up.\"\n\nIan responds firmly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Grow up. You can do courses after high school to bring up your marks if that is your issue. Just think of what you want to do, without worrying about the how.\"\n\nHe responds. You think he\u0027s saying this more based on his experience than anything. After all, his family doesn\u0027t have much money, so he probably thought at some point becoming a doctor was impossible for him as well. You nod in response, then ponder a bit more about what to become as you walk together, but come no closer to an answer.\n","page 258":"You slowly gain conscious again, and as you do you realize you\u0027re laying in your bed at your house.

Allison gives you a quick glance, but remains silent.\n\n\"Come on, just a bit. I can\u0027t do this on my own.\"\n\nAt this, Allison stop walking and sighs.\n\n\"You\u0027re wrong.

Allison gives you another glance, before turning into the school.\n\n\"Now, I try again...Good luck, Jacob.\"\n\nAllison replies, with a weak smile. Before you get the chance to say anything, Allison quite literally disappears in front of you. At least, you think she does. You think a girl just disappeared from in front of you. Wait, a girl disappeared from in front of you? No, that\u0027s ridiculous. You shake your head and walk into the school, wondering why you suddenly feel an immense sense of loss, but not being able to recall why.\n","page 0":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off. You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n“Hey Jake.”\n\n“Hey Ian, ready for another exciting day?” You ask sarcastically.\n\n“Oh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.” He replies with equal sarcasm, “I hope I never quit.”\n\n“Ah yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn’t it?”\n\n“A lifelong-dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to live that dream.”\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there’s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it’s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o’clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.\n","page 260":"You glance down at the bat in your hands as you sprint towards the fair. You\u0027re not really sure why you grabbed it, now that you think about it, but you\u0027re sure it\u0027ll come in handy. Sorting through your fresh memories, you remember that you actually fought all four of the guys you know are with Tina right now. You also broke your arm during that time, which is likely why you instinctively took the bat with you.\n\nReaching the fairground, you run through it to the other side, and finally into the forest behind it. You\u0027re thoroughly exhausted by the time you get there, but you finally manage to reach the opening in the forest you know you\u0027re supposed to go to.\n\nJust like you expected, you see Tina, along with the four boys and three girls from your memory. These are the seven people that bullied Tina until she broke down and dropped out of school. You tightly grip the bat, trying to contain your anger, when suddenly you notice that Ian is also there, between you and the other group, and he too is armed with a bat.\n\n\"About time you showed up, Jacob.\"\n\nIan says. You have no idea why he\u0027s here though, as in none of your memories he shows up.\n\n\"Y-yeah...\"\n\nYou reply, unsure of what else to say, as you walk up beside him.\n\n\"Anyway, let\u0027s get this over with.\"\n\nIan says, reading his bat. You look at Tina, who looks both scared and confused, and then to her group of bullies. One large guy, about the same size as you and Ian, holds a bat, while the rest of the guys are smaller, and unarmed. The three girls slowly back away during this time. This will be a pretty one sided fight.\n","page 141":"\"What the hell, man?\"\n\nIan angrily complains as the two of you eat lunch.\n\n\"If you\u0027re going to go to school ahead of me at least call or something.\"\n\nHe says.

I just forgot to tell you.\"\n\n\"Jackass.\"\n\n\"Hey, I said sorry.\"\n\n\"She agree at least?\"\n\n\"Of course. You ask Olivia yet?\"\n\n\"Ah...not quite.

Ah...no real reason.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"So, what\u0027s new with you?\"\n\nShe asks. You briefly wonder if you should tell her about your sister and the fair, before deciding it doesn\u0027t really matter and telling her anyway.\n\n\"Not much, I\u0027m gonna go to the fair with my sister.\"\n\nYou say.\n\n\"Ohhh, how nice. Do you do things often with her?\"\n\n\"Well, no, not really actually.

Make no mistake, I\u0027d like nothing more that to beat you little shits into your place.\"\n\nYou say, gentle tapping your bat on your hand. You\u0027re telling the complete truth. You can remember all the suffering they caused her. Hell, it could even be said that these punks ruined her life before.\n\n\"But, there\u0027s no need for that. We can end this peacefully.\"\n\nYou say, turning to Tina. You see her smile slightly as you do, reassuring you that this is what she wants too. For some reason, it just feels right, doing this rather than fighting.\n\n\"Alright. We\u0027ll leave her alone, and she\u0027ll change schools.\"\n\nThe biggest guy says, agreeing to the terms.\n\n\"Good, now fuck off.\"\n\nYou say, motioning for them to leave. They quickly comply, knowing that they just narrowly escaped an ass beating. With that, you and Ian approach Tina. Knowing that you need to make things right between the two of you, you speak up.\n\n\"Tina, I\u0027m sorry for the way I\u0027ve treat you. I\u0027ve been a terrible brother.\"\n\nYou see Tina about to speak, but you interrupt her, being able to guess what she\u0027s about to say.\n\n\"You\u0027re right. I haven\u0027t cared about you for the longest time. I hated you, I blamed you for everything bad that happened to me.\"\n\nYou openly admit.

I promise I\u0027ll be the brother you deserve now.\"\n\nYou say. Unable to hold it, Tina now begins to cry. Suddenly you feel a smack on your shoulder, and see Ian with a tear in his eye.\n\n\"That\u0027s how family is supposed to be.\"\n\nHe says with a grin. You grin as well, and try and hold your own tears back, as you hear that familiar \u0027pop\u0027, and everything goes dark again.\n","page 140":"\"I...I need more time to think.\"\n\nYou reply weakly. Allison gives you a surprised look, which you take to mean she didn\u0027t expect that.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, just give me a bit more time to think. I can probably think of something.\"\n\nYou say, almost desperately. You\u0027re not sure what you want to do now, but you\u0027re sure that if you keep thinking about it, you\u0027ll be able to figure it out. That\u0027s right, you just need a bit more time. At this, Allison gives you a big smile, and hugs you. You stand frozen, suddenly incredibly conscious of the fact that other students are passing you and can see this pretty girl with her arms around you. A moment later, Allison loosens her grip and steps back.\n\n\"Correct!\"\n\nShe exclaims with a big smile.\n\n\"Correct?\"\n\nYou ask, confused as to how that is correct at all.\n\n\"Of course. There\u0027s no way you could think of what you wanted to do after just one night. What\u0027s important is that you keep on thinking, and keep on trying things, until you find the right answer.\"\n\nShe replies with a grin. You frown and glare at her.\n\n\"That\u0027s unfair.\"\n\nYou say unhappily. You suddenly feel like she\u0027s just toying with you.\n\n\"I agree completely. More importantly, it\u0027s time to move on!\"\n\nAllison announces, grabbing your wrist and leading you away from the school.\n\n\"Wait, where are we going?\"\n\n\"I\u0027m sure you already know by now.\"\n\nShe replies, as the two of you walk forward.\n","page 261":"Confident in your ability to win, you rush forward with your bat at the ready, and Ian follows. The fight is as one-sided as you expected, and you let your anger get the better of you, causing a few more broken bones than necessary. By the end of it, the group of boys lay battered and beaten on the ground, while the three girls look on from the edge of the forest, terrified. You and Ian however, are almost perfectly fine.\n\n\"Well, that was easy.\"\n\nIan exclaims after it\u0027s finished. You nod and then look at your sister.\n\n\"Tina...I\u0027m sorry.\"\n\nYou begin.\n\n\"I\u0027ve been a terrible brother.\"\n\nYou state. However, rather than a heartfelt moment between you and her like you expected, Tina backs away from you, clearly afraid as well. You\u0027re not even sure she heard what you just said.\n\n\"Tina?\"\n\nYou ask, confused as to why she\u0027s acting this way.\n\n\"T-thanks...\"\n\nShe stutters quietly, backing away as she does. You go to move closer to her, but she turns around and runs away. Confused, you look at Ian, who shrugs.\n\n\"Maybe we took it a bit too far...\"\n\nHe says, glancing down at the kids the two of you beat up. You think over if maybe you really did take it too far, but suddenly you hear a familiar \u0027pop\u0027, and everything goes dark.\n","page 143":"The next morning you say you\u0027re bringing Tina to school again, to which your mother thanks you. Luckily, you told Ian yesterday you\u0027d be taking her, so he won\u0027t wait for you again today. As the two of you get ready, you yet again find yourself getting annoyed by Tina.\n\nShe puts on her shoes in a slow and calculated manner.\n\nIt annoys you.\n\nShe timidly says goodbye to your mother.\n\nIt annoys you.\n\nShe awkwardly stands at the end of your walkway and patiently waits for you.\n\nIt annoys you.\n\nEverything she\u0027s doing annoys you. It\u0027s not like she\u0027s intentionally annoying you, at least you doubt she is. Heck, there isn\u0027t even anything really annoying about what she\u0027s doing, so why is it getting at you? Why are you disliking being near her so much?\n\nThe two of you walk to her school in silence as you wonder about this. Upon arriving, Tina asks you the same thing she asked yesterday.\n\n\"So...will you pick me up again?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. Bye Tina.\"\n\nYou say, agreeing to pick her up. The two of you wave to each other and she enters her school. You\u0027re probably just feeling sick or something. That\u0027s why you\u0027re so agitated. Nothing else would really make sense.\n\nOnce you arrive at your school, classes pass without issue. However, during lunch Ian decides to bring something up.\n\n\"Hey I\u0027ve been meaning to ask, what\u0027s with that Allison girl?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, she\u0027s been talking to you even though you just met right?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"So, she\u0027s into you man.\"\n\n\"...and?\"\n\nIan frowns and glares at you.\n\n\"You\u0027re kidding right? You haven\u0027t even thought about asking her out?\"\n\nObviously you\u0027ve thought about that, but you\u0027re a decade in the past. There\u0027s no way you\u0027d actually do it, you\u0027d feel like you\u0027re taking advantage of Allison. Of course, you can\u0027t really tell Ian this, so instead you just shrug.\n\n\"Naw, I\u0027m good. I doubt she really likes me anyway.\"\n\nIs your reply. As you say that Allison appears behind you, and Ian waves her over.\n","page 264":"You groggily awaken, and as you do you realize that yet again you are laying on your bed. It feels like it\u0027s early morning though, and oddly enough, you don\u0027t feel any pain on your face.

You also see alternatives to that, where you actually helped them, and managed to prevent that from occurring. You remember the Wolves, and you remember how you treated Ian. Just like Olivia and Tina, you ignored him. Your best friend, the person who stuck by you even in the future where you both became screw-ups together, and you didn\u0027t help him when he needed you. No, looking into your memories, you see that not only did you not help him, but because you didn\u0027t help him, you ruined his life as well. You dragged him down with you. This time, no tears come. You\u0027re basically all cried out that this point anyway, and your self-loathing is overwhelming you.\n\nI\u0027m a terrible person.\n\nYou think, yet again. There\u0027s really no other way to explain it. You screwed over the lives of everyone that cared about you.As you think this, you stand up from your bed and rush towards the front door. You\u0027re changing that now. Even if that\u0027s what you did before, you can change it now. You can make everything right. Something tells you that once you help Ian, everything will be fine. It\u0027ll all come together, and everyone will be happy.\n\nYou mock yourself for thinking of such an odd fairytale ending to this, as you leave your house.

You shake your head, as that doesn\u0027t matter right now anyway.\n\nIan and his brother, Peter, will be at the \u0027Wolf den\u0027 right now. You need to be there to stop Peter from killing someone, so that Ian doesn\u0027t go into a downwards spiral.\n","page 142":"After all your classes are done, you tell Ian you\u0027re going to pick up your sister instead of walking home with him.\n\n\"Well, we can still go together.\"\n\nIan responds, as if you just told him something stupid by saying to leave without you. You shrug and say sure, and the two of you head to Tina\u0027s school.\n\nThe two of you arrive a good ten minutes after their classes ended, so unsurprisingly most of the students are already gone. Most of them except your sister, along with the people you saw her with the other day. They seem to be speaking with her on the steps again, but upon noticing you and Ian, decide to leave. The three girls and four guys stare you and Ian down as they pass, but say nothing.\n\n\"What\u0027s with them?\"\n\nIan asks. Not really knowing what\u0027s with them, you just shrug. Tina walks towards you two, and dissatisfied with your answer, Ian decides to ask her.\n\n\"Hey, what was with those kids?\"\n\nHe asks bluntly. Tina\u0027s eyes go wide before she looks away.\n\n\"Um...it\u0027s nothing.\"\n\nShe says, avoiding the question. Ian frowns and sighs.\n\n\"Well, if it turns into something let us know. Right, Jacob?\"\n\nHe says, smacking your shoulder.\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nYou reply unenthusiastically. Your sister\u0027s problems are her own after all. She should be the one to deal with them. Ian gives another frown, but accepts your answer anyway. The three of you walk back to your house, and Ian takes his leave. When he does, you look at your sister.\n\nFor some odd reason, you\u0027ve been feeling uncomfortable around her. You glare at her silently, as if doing so will tell you why. Tina notices and becomes nervous.\n\n\"Um...Jacob?\"\n\nShe asks timidly. It annoys you, the way that she asks, so you walk away without answering. Why does it annoy you? Upon entering your house, you realize just how cold that was of you, so you turn around to Tina.\n\n\"It\u0027s nothing, come on.\"\n\nYou tell her, to which she nods and enters the house as well. In spite of saying you want to get closer to her, your unease around Tina causes you to avoid her for the rest of the night.\n","page 263":"You groggily awaken, and as you do you realize that yet again you are laying on your bed.

It\u0027s probably for the better if she just lays there for a minute though. The four guys stand their ground, but seem hesitant to be the first to attack you. Deciding to leave the biggest guy for last, you aim for the right-most one. He panics as you get close, and doesn\u0027t put his hands up to protect his face in time.\n\nAnd you hit him in the cheek, as hard as you can. You let out all the anger and frustration you have at both yourself and at this situation in that first punch. You feel his jaw give in and with your follow-through, launch him a good foot backwards. He screams in pain, but you ignore it. His buddies however, don\u0027t, and no longer seem hesitant to hit you back.\n\n\"SON OF A BITCH!\"\n\nThe biggest guy yells, bringing his bat above his head. Though, even if he\u0027s the biggest in the group, he\u0027s still only a bit larger than you are. As he brings it down, you roll to the side and dodge it, then angle yourself to hit another one of them. The next guy you aim for instinctively protects his face, but that wasn\u0027t your target to begin with. You throw another full force punch into his gut, causing him to lose his breath and cough. As he doubles over onto the ground in pain, the fourth guy kicks you in the side. You groan in pain, but are able to catch his leg and push him back onto the ground.\n\nAs you do this however, the leader of the group swings around and hits you with his bat. Unfortunately, you\u0027re unable to dodge this time, and are forced to take the impact with your left arm. Which promptly breaks from the impact.\n\nYou hear a distinct crack, and a flash of blinding white pain flows through your body. However that won\u0027t stop you, no, it can\u0027t stop you now. You\u0027ve been in enough fights to suffer a few broken bones, and with the familiarity to the pain, have gained the ability to withstand it. That being said, the force of the blow still causes you to fall to the ground.\n\n\"Ha, stupid fucker. I don\u0027t know who this bitch is to you, but we\u0027re not letting her off with a small beating now. Maybe we\u0027ll break her arm too, haha. Hey, you alright, John?\"\n\nThe leader says, turning to the guy whose jaw you broke.\n\n\"LIKE HELL YOU FUCKING WILL!\"\n\nYou scream as you get back to your feet. The leader turns to you, surprised that you were able to stand back up. As he brings his bat back again, you charge forward, and before he can strike, punch him square in the nose. He screams in pain, and the bat leaves his hands. Taking this as your chance, you quickly run to it and pick it up with your good arm, then position yourself between them and Tina.\n\nTina has, since the start of the fight, stood up and slowly back away, making her way to the edge of the forest. The three girls are now no where to be seen, and the four guys are sprawled out on the ground. You take deep breathes to try and steady your breathing again, in order to calm down. After a minute, the four guys slowly stand up, and your breathing returns to normal. You point the bat threateningly at them.\n\n\"We\u0027re done here. If you ever even look at Tina again, you won\u0027t be able to walk away next time.\"\n\nYou say to them. They look among themselves and glare at you. You know they don\u0027t want to back down, and this was probably the worst way to solve this problem. But, truthfully you\u0027re not that bright, and this was the only way you could think of to solve it. Well, actually it\u0027s more like this is the only way you wanted to solve it. You needed some way to get rid of all your pent of frustration and anger.\n","page 166":"Feeling uneasy, you decide to look for her. Tina had been acting kind of weird for the last little bit, so maybe something happened. You give a quick scan of your surroundings, when suddenly you her a scream. It\u0027s faint, and you wouldn\u0027t have even heard it had you not been paying attention, but you can tell its direction.\n\nThere\u0027s a forest nearby, and for some reason that\u0027s where the scream is coming from. You hope it\u0027s not Tina, but you know you need to check it out anyway. Even if it\u0027s not her you should help the person in need. Before you know it, you find yourself frantically sprinting through the thicket, when you suddenly reach a clearing.\n\nAnd she\u0027s there.\n\nYou see Tina about 50 meters ahead of you, on the ground, surrounded by the same seven students, four guys and three girls, you keep seeing around her. This time however, they don\u0027t seem to have any intention of leaving even if you\u0027re here. In fact, one of them actually has a bat with him. As he\u0027s armed and the largest, you assume him to be their leader. Right now, one of the girls is sitting on top of Tina, with another one seemingly taunting her. The largest guy turns to you and smiles.\n\n\"Hey, what the fuck you lookin\u0027 at?\"\n\nHe asks mockingly. He then turns to Tina and points his bat at her.\n\n\"Ah, you know this bitch? Then you must know how miserable she\u0027s making our lives. Making us all look bad. But, I suppose that\u0027s how it is. Some women can\u0027t listen to reason, and got to be beat into place.\"\n\nHe continues. As he does, the girl on top of Tina pulls her hair, lifting her head off the ground, and the group laughs.\n\nThis happened before.\n\nYou realize, a chill running deep through your body. It happened before. This isn\u0027t some chance meeting, or some freak event, it already happened.\n\nYou let it happen.\n\nYou glare at the group of kids, who continue to smile at you.\n\n\"Ha, the fuck you thinkin\u0027 of? Even if you\u0027re a bit older, there\u0027s four of us and one of you!\"\n\nYou wanted it to happen.\n\nYou think as he taunts you. That\u0027s right, this must have been what happened to cause Tina to drop out of school. A flash of memory goes through your mind, with Tina entering the door, battered and bruised. You grit your teeth.\n\nYou knew it was happening.\n\nIn the memory you give her one look, and walk away without saying anything.\n\nIt\u0027s your fault it happened.\n\n\"Hey, you fucking listening to me?\"\n\nYou clench your fist in frustration. You\u0027re frustrated at yourself for not realizing this sooner, and for doing nothing the first time around. What\u0027s worse is...\n\nThey\u0027re just like me...\n\nYou think as you continue to silently glare at them. The group seems to stop what they\u0027re doing and watch you. They\u0027re mad at her for making them look bad, the exact same reason you hated her for so long. It frustrates you. Tina lived through this alone once already. It\u0027s only natural she would have dropped out if she had to deal with this alone.\n\n\"Hey, you gonna fucking say something or-\"\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU\u0027RE DOING?\"\n\nYou yell back, interrupting him. You can\u0027t hold it much longer. All you can think about is beating each and every one of them into the ground. You take a step forward, and the group seems to take a step back.\n\n\"He speaks! Listen, let us show her whose boss, after that you can-\"\n\nBut you don\u0027t care what he\u0027s doing. Mid sentence you sprint full speed at the group. You\u0027ll probably get hurt.\n\nYou deserve it anyway.\n\nIt\u0027s four versus one, and they have a weapon, but you have years of experience fighting, and three to four years on all of them. But, you could solve it peacefully, right? You chuckle at the thought as you reach the group.\n\nFuck that.\n\nThey need to feel pain. They need to regret doing this to your sister.\n","page 169":"Congratulations! You got the good end for Tina\u0027s route!\n\n\nNow that you\u0027ve gotten one of the real endings, you can replay the game to get the true ending to the entire story. As a hint, I\u0027ll say the true ending lies in Allison\u0027s route.\n\n\nI\u0027d highly recommend you save right now before deciding to replay or end the game. The next time you want to play, load up this saved game and hit replay, so the system will have it saved that you already completed Tina\u0027s Good End. That way, you will be able to reach the true ending to the story, which is otherwise locked.\n\n\nOr you can try to get the other character\u0027s good ends first.\n\n\nGood luck!\n","page 168":"\"Fine, whatever.\"\n\nThe leader of the group reluctantly says, agreeing while holding his nose.\n\n\"She ain\u0027t worth all this shit. Just make sure she stays the fuck away from us too.\"\n\nHe says, as the group gets up and leaves together. You can still hear a few of them moan in pain, but it shouldn\u0027t be anything permanent. Well, apart from maybe the guy with the broken jaw. With that, you turn to Tina, who looks at the ground beside you.\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"Sorry Tina, I dropped the pretzels.\"\n\nYou interrupt her with a smile, looking at the two large pretzels in the middle of the open field.\n\n\"Your arm...\"\n\nShe says softly, looking at it. You look at it as well, and notice that you can even see the bone through the skin on your forearm.\n\n\"Yeah, it\u0027s pretty bad. We should go now.\"\n\nYou reply, as you throw away the bat. With that, the two of you leave the forest and the fair. You don\u0027t say anything about those that bullied her on the way back. You can\u0027t, after all, every time you think of it it just reminds you of the part you played in it happening. There were so many signs, and you ignored them all, the first time around and this time. At least this time you were able to make it right. That\u0027s the only silver lining you see here, as you try to forget the fact that this ended much differently before.\n\nYour mother is noticeably upset at your broken arm when you return home, and the three of you immediately head to the emergency room to get it treated. However she\u0027s far more understanding when you explain how you got it. Much to you and your mother\u0027s surprise, Tina reveals that she no longer wants to attend the private school anyway, and instead asks if she can just transfer to your high school. Your mother is put off by this, but after some convincing eventually agrees to it. It\u0027s not the kind of ending you\u0027d expect after the fight, but you suppose the best thing in this case is for her to just leave that school. Your not sure what will happen, but you know that you were able to make things right by your sister, and that\u0027s enough for now.\n","page 171":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off.

She sees the two of your approaching, and immediately looks away.\n\n\"So cold, Olivia, what\u0027s wrong?\"\n\nIan asks with feigned sadness.\n\n\"You know I have a boyfriend, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027m pretty sure the entire school knows by now.\"\n\n\"Then why do you keep talking to me?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s a mystery. Isn\u0027t it, Jacob?\"\n\nIan says, turning to you. You nod silently, then suddenly realize you have no idea how to be his wing man, and that your idea of winging it is failing you tremendously. You should probably be saying something about Ian now, right?\n","page 156":"You bite your lip, not wanting to answer Allison honestly, but give in.\n\n\"I hate her...\"\n\nYou say scornfully. Allison removes her foot from your bed, and seems to calm down.\n\n\"Alright, now we can get somewhere.\"\n\nShe says, seemingly relieved.\n\n\"Can you just leave now? I want to be alone.\"\n\nYou mumble, trying to get Allison to go. She must surely think you\u0027re a terrible person now, not that your relationship with your sister was any of her business to begin with.\n\n\"Why do you hate her?\"\n\nAllison calmly asks, ignoring your request. She takes a seat on a chair in your room, and faces you. You\u0027re hesitant to answer her, but eventually give in.\n\n\"She ruined my life. How could I not hate her?\"\n\nYou say softly. You\u0027re not liking this conversation one bit. It makes you feel terrible to admit this kind of thing.\n\n\"Is it her fault your life was ruined?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Is it actually her fault, or are you just blaming her?\"\n\nAllison calmly asks. Why does she care? Of course it\u0027s Tina\u0027s fault. She\u0027s the one that wanted to go to the private school.\n\nSo?\n\nShe\u0027s the reason you moved away from your friends.\n\nSo?\n\nShe\u0027s the reason you failed to achieve anything.\n\nIs she really?\n\nOf course she is. You failed because of her.\n\nDid you?\n\nOf course you did. In the future you become nothing more than a stock boy. If that\u0027s not a failure than you don\u0027t know what is. You inner argument appears to reach its end, when suddenly another thought occurs.\n\nIs it her fault you stopped trying?\n\nThis thought causes you to think. Well no, it\u0027s only her fault you failed once, right?\n\nHow was that even her fault?\n\nWell she succeeded and you failed, so of course it was her fault.\n\nHow was it her fault you failed?\n\nYou can\u0027t think of an answer.\n\nAren\u0027t you just blaming her?\n\nOf course you\u0027re blaming her. It\u0027s her fault.\n\nBut how was it her fault?\n\nAgain you can\u0027t think of an answer. The realization slowly dawns on you, and you look Allison in the eyes. She\u0027s right. She\u0027s completely right. You\u0027ve just been blaming Tina for you inability to succeed. No, you\u0027ve just been using her as an excuse to not even try. How can you fail if you don\u0027t even try after all. You grip your comforter tightly, unable to contain your frustration. You\u0027re an idiot. It\u0027s not Tina\u0027s fault she\u0027s smarter than you, and it sure as hell isn\u0027t her fault you stopped trying. You\u0027ve been hating her for all these years, and she did nothing to deserve it.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nYou begin, taking in a large breath.\n\n\"I\u0027m an idiot...\"\n\nYou say, defeated. Allison gently places a hand on your shoulder.\n\n\"As long as you understand.\"\n\nShe says with a cheeky smile. You frown, as she seems to find some amusement in teasing you when you\u0027re feeling this down.\n","page 277":"After Allison disappears, you fall to your knees, and begin sobbing uncontrollably. You can\u0027t believe it really ended this way. In all of this, it was clearly Allison that suffered more than anyone, and it was her that had to sacrifice everything. She did it all for you. She did it all for you, so there\u0027s no way you could actually forget about her. You refuse to. You\u0027ll remember Allison for as long as you live. You\u0027ll find something that you want to do, and you\u0027ll find her, and the two of you will live happily ever after, just like she always wanted.\n\nMonths pass, and ever so slowly, your memory of Allison fades. True to what she said, you forget about going through time with her help, and eventually, about her all together. What you don\u0027t forget however, is how you helped everyone else, and that you have a burning desire to find something to do with your life. Even after a few months though, you still don\u0027t manage to think of anything, but you\u0027re sure you\u0027ll come up with something eventually.\n\nTina ends up switching schools, just like you said she should. Apparently those that bullied her kept their word, and left her alone. She ends up switching to your old high school, which you just barely manage to graduate from. She hasn\u0027t started classes again yet, but for the first time, she seems excited.\n\nOlivia\u0027s boyfriend ends up breaking up with her a few weeks after you rekindle your friendship with her. She gets depressed over the matter, but you\u0027re able to be there for her, so she gets over it. Furthermore, Ian is also there for her, and the two of them end up really getting along.\n\nIan himself ends up getting a scholarship to a fancy university like he wanted. His proclamations of becoming a great doctor seem to be coming true, and you\u0027re sure he\u0027s bound to succeed. You\u0027re happy for him. Thinking about it, you\u0027re happy for everyone. Life seems to be going well, and for the first time in a long time, you\u0027re happy as well.\n\nYou\u0027re not sure why though, but you can\u0027t help feeling like you\u0027ve lost something really important, in spite of that happiness. You walk through a crowded street, pondering over this. You\u0027ve begun to take these kinds of walks often now. You\u0027re not even sure why, but every once in a while you feel the urge to just aimlessly wander around town, almost as if you\u0027re searching for something. Suddenly, you notice something pink out of the corner of your eye move past you. Turning your head, you see a girl.\n\nA beautiful girl, with long blonde and pink hair, flowing down to her waist. A familiar looking girl. One who you instantly recognize as someone you should know. Do you know her? Unable to shake the feeling, you approach the girl, who gives you an unsure look as you stop in front of her.\n\n\"U-um, can I help you?\"\n\nShe asks, surprised.\n\n\"Ah, well, I\u0027m sorry to interrupt you. It\u0027s just, I can\u0027t help but think we\u0027ve met before...\"\n\nYou say, unsure of what else to say. The girl looks you up and down for a moment, before smiling.\n\n\"Funny, I was thinking the same thing. I\u0027m Allison.\"\n\nShe says, extending her hand to you. Smiling back, you extend your own hand and shake hers.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Allison. I\u0027m Jacob.\"\n","page 155":"\"She\u0027s my sister, of course I like her.\"\n\nYou lie. There\u0027s no way you\u0027d admit you hate your own sister. You can understand that makes you a terrible person, even if the reason is one you think is good enough to warrant hating her. Allison takes her foot off of your bed and sighs, calming down.\n\n\"I see. That settles it then.\"\n\nIs all she says, as she leaves your room. You wait a few minutes to see if Allison comes back, but it seems like she left your house after leaving your room. You sigh, relieved, and go back to resting. What was with her anyway?\n\nIt takes you a few days, but eventually you get back on your feet and return to school. Ian tries to ask what was wrong, but you just shrug him off and say you were sick. Allison doesn\u0027t show up at school anymore, and needless to say you go back to ignoring Tina, and don\u0027t bring her to the fair.\n\nJust like you planned, after school is finished you leave your house, and never interact with Tina again.\n","page 276":"\"I\u0027m sorry, but there isn\u0027t a fairytale ending for me in this story...\"\n\nAllison says, through her tears. Your heart drops as you try and understand what she means.\n\n\"I\u0027ve done this too many times...even if we lived together forever...I don\u0027t think I could really appreciate it...\"\n\nShe says. What does she mean? It\u0027s over now, isn\u0027t it?\n\n\"W-what are you saying Allison? We did it. It\u0027s over now, you don\u0027t-\"\n\nYou say desperately. Allison puts her finger over your lips and stops you. She then gently shakes her head, and tries to wipe away her tears with her other sleeve.\n\n\"Time travel isn\u0027t so simple...if I stay here, it will just loop again eventually.\"\n\nShe tries to explain.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry. I have to go back to my future...and...\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"And you\u0027ll forget about me when I do...\"\n\nShe finishes. You\u0027ll forget about Allison? There\u0027s no way that\u0027s possible. There\u0027s no way you could forget about her. That\u0027s just too cruel. How can this be the ending that she wanted? You start crying again, and before you know it, you find yourself hugging her again.\n\n\"You...can\u0027t.\"\n\nIs all you manage to get out. Allison stands there, almost lifeless in your arms. She doesn\u0027t want to resist, but it seems she doesn\u0027t want to support this action either.\n\n\"I have to.\"\n\nShe replies in a whisper.\n\n\"You\u0027ll forget about me, but you\u0027ll remember everything else. If everything goes well, you\u0027ll meet the me from this timeline later on. The two of you can share your lives together. Like I\u0027ve always wanted.\"\n\nAllison says, ending your hug.\n\n\"There\u0027s no way...I could forget you.\"\n\nYou say, attempting to wipe away your own tears.\n\n\"I was living here in the past. If you stay in this city, you\u0027re bound to run into me sometime.\"\n\nShe says softly, with a saddened expression.\n\n\"There\u0027s no way I could...\"\n\nYou repeat. Allison finally puts the bracelet she took from you back onto her wrist, and presses a few buttons. Once she seems satisfied with it, she leans into you and gives you one last kiss. You don\u0027t want this to end. You don\u0027t want to be separated from her. This can\u0027t end like this. You won\u0027t let it end like this.\n\nAllison breaks away from you, and forces a smile.\n\n\"Remember, find something you want to do, and do it. And, if you find me, treat me well.\"\n\nShe says, clearly holding back tears.\n\n\"I\u0027m a pretty good catch, if you ask me.\"\n\nShe says with another forced smile, and with that, you hear a \u0027pop\u0027, and the girl known as Allison, vanishes from in front of you.\n","page 157":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off.

You hadn\u0027t thought about it until recently, but going back in time is probably the best thing to happen to you. You\u0027ve always been an emotional person, so you suppose it just took time to get over what happened in the past. Time which, back then, or rather now, you didn\u0027t have.\n\nThe two of you go on some of the rides, when Tina begins to appear a little tense.\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong Tina?\"\n\nYou ask concerned. She looks at you, then the ground, before asking for the time. You look at your watch and see it\u0027s about 6pm, relaying the information back to her.\n\n\"I see...\"\n\nShe says uneasily.\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing...\"\n\nTina replies, with a lame attempt to reassure you. The two of you exit the spinning cups you were just on, and find a seat on a nearby bench. Thinking back, you remember seeing a few good food stalls, so you get an idea.\n\n\"Hey Tina, wait here for a minute and hold this bench. I\u0027ll go get us some food.\"\n\nYou tell her. She seems hesitant for some reason, but nods her head in agreement. With that, you leave her side and return to the fair.\n\nSure enough, after a short search you find a giant pretzel stand. During the fair you had a memory, in which you saw her happily eating one. Hopping to reenact that memory, you purchase the pretzel and return to the bench.\n\nBut Tina isn\u0027t there anymore.\n","page 189":"\"Hey Peter?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"Why did Ian join the Wolves?\"\n\nYou ask. Finding out Ian\u0027s intentions for being part of the Wolves was one of the biggest reasons you agreed to join them after all.\n\n\"Well, the two of us pretty much made the Wolves. Originally it was just me hanging around here when I didn\u0027t want to be at the house, but eventually Ian followed me here.\"\n\nHe says.\n\n\"And well, when he did he insisted on staying here with me. I said no at first, but he eventually got me to agree.\"\n\nPeter continues with a smile.\n\n\"After a few times of hanging around here together, we decided to call it our gang. Our home away from home. Then, over time, others joined us.\"\n\nHe finishes, no doubt referring to the three others he had shown up with. You\u0027re relieved that the Wolves don\u0027t seem to have any ill intentions, but something else bothers you now.\n\n\"In that case, why was Ian saying before that some other gang was threatening you guys?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"Ah yeah, that. Well apparently there\u0027s a real gang in this city now, and they\u0027ve basically said everything in the city is their turf, including this building. So, naturally when they came inside and told us to get out, we told them to fuck off.\"\n\nHe replies.\n\n\"And let\u0027s just say they didn\u0027t take that all too well, haha.\"\n","page 188":"Deciding you have no more questions for Peter, you stop talking.\n\n\"Well, let\u0027s go back and tell everyone the good news.\"\n\nHe says, leading you out the room. You nod silently and follow him. Peter leads you back to the side-room office, and the two of you enter together. The four inside, Ian and the other three members of the Wolves, look up from what they\u0027re doing, and anxiously wait for Peter to speak.\n\n\"He\u0027s in. Jacob is now a wolf!\"\n\nHe says, and then in a dramatic manner, lifts up your arm. You try and play along, but find it hard to really care all that much that you\u0027re in the Wolves. Ian walks up and congratulates you, and you spend the next few hours getting to know the rest of the group. All of them, as you expected, have some sort of family issue, which caused them to cut ties with their families and join the Wolves. They all work, in fact their jobs are within 10 minutes of this building, but most don\u0027t take their jobs too seriously, and seem to just live day by day. You start to wonder if maybe this mentality is the reason Ian turned out the way he did.\n\nEventually, the day ends and everyone says their goodbyes. All in all you don\u0027t think any of them are bad people, just a bit rough on the edges. With that in mind, you walk back to your house with Ian and wonder about what you can do to help fix his future.\n\n\"Hey Ian?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"What are you going to try and do after you graduate?\"\n\nYou ask, trying to confirm something. Ian ponders for a minute before answer.\n\n\"That\u0027s a pretty heavy question. I suppose I\u0027m going to try to become a doctor. Gotta make sure I ace these last exams to get a good scholarship though.\"\n\nHe replies, and you confirm that he does in fact care about his future. But that just confuses you even more, because if this is the way he feels, he should never had ended up like you did.\n\n\"Really? A doctor?\"\n\n\"Yep, why\u0027d you want to know?\"\n\n\"Ah, no real reason, I was just curious since you\u0027re smart and all.\"\n\nYou lie.\n\n\"Oh, well alright then.\"\n\nIan replies, thinking that\u0027s the end of the conversation.\n","page 190":"\"Hey Peter, what about the rest of your family?\"\n\nPeter immediately freezes and gets a grim look on his face.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You kept mentioning how your house wasn\u0027t really a home...that\u0027s why you made the Wolves right?\"\n\nPeter clearly doesn\u0027t like this topic, but decides to answer you.\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\nHe says with a sigh.\n\n\"Alright, I\u0027ll tell you then. You seem trustworthy enough.\"\n\nHe begins.\n\n\"Ian and I grew up with just our father, as our mother died when we were younger. Our father was, and probably still is, a useless fucking drunk.\"\n\nHe says scornfully.\n\n\"What\u0027s worse, is he was a manipulative and abusive bastard too. He\u0027d get us to spend hours doing the most pointless things, just because he thought he could. Then, whenever he was upset at something, he\u0027d beat us.\"\n\nHe continues.\n\n\"It was terrible, so I started running away. Eventually I found this place. Ian, while looking for me, also managed to find it. We decided that even if it was run-down and dirty, it was still more suitable as a home than our place.\"\n\nHe says, his fists beginning to shake a bit.\n\n\"But, our father didn\u0027t like that. He didn\u0027t like us not being there to serve him. One time when we got home, he decided to give us a beating to put us in our place. But I was fed up, I fought that fucker back, and even though he was terrified, Ian helped too.\"\n\nHe continues, releasing his fists.\n\n\"We won, if you can call beating the shit out of your own father winning. We don\u0027t know what happened to our father after that. We woke up the next day and he was just gone. The landlord came by one day asking for rent, so I had to drop out of school to work. I still don\u0027t know how he managed to pay for the place when all he did was sit on his ass all day haha...\"\n\nHe says with a weak laugh.\n\n\"That\u0027s why...this is our home now, and the Wolves are our family. That place is a house, but even without our father there, we still can\u0027t consider it a home. Too many bad memories. We\u0027ve only had each other, me and Ian, for as long as I can remember. And...aw well, I guess that should be enough.\"\n\nPeter says, finishing his story. You never knew. Even though you\u0027ve been friends with Ian for so long, you still never knew he had a past like this. You never bothered to ask, you never thought it was this bad. But even so, it doesn\u0027t explain why he become a stock boy. He\u0027s smart, so he should easily be able to get some sort of scholarship, so why?\n\n\"Anyway, that\u0027s enough of that kind of talk, let\u0027s go Jacob.\"\n\nYou nod and thank him for telling you, following him out the room. You feel kind of sick to your stomach after hearing all of that, but you try to ignore it.\n","page 192":"Deciding you have no more questions for Peter, you stop talking.\n\n\"Well, let\u0027s go back and tell everyone the good news.\"\n\nHe says, leading you out the room.

One guy is really fat and looks mean, another is average built, and is dressed in punk clothing, complete with tattoos and bright green hair. The girl also is dressed in punk, but instead has purple hair. The final guy, appearing to be the leader, is the tallest, with a muscular build and a mean expression.

One guy is really fat and looks mean, another is average built, and is dressed in punk clothing, complete with tattoos and bright green hair. The girl also is dressed in punk, but instead has purple hair. The final guy, appearing to be the leader, is the tallest, with a muscular build and a mean expression. The four of them greet Ian, then look to you with a confused expression. Noticing this, Ian quickly intervenes.\n\n\"Ah, this is Jacob, my friend that I was telling you about, Peter.\"\n\nHe says to the tallest one, whom you now assume to be his brother. Peter looks you up and down before nodding.\n\n\"Ha, nice to meet you then, Jacob.\"\n\nHe says, his expression suddenly turning very friendly as he extends his hand.\n\n\"You too...\"\n\nYou reply as you shake his hand, somewhat hesitantly. This whole situation seems so strange to you. Who would have thought Ian was actually in a gang like this.\n\n\"Well, suppose we should get to it. Let\u0027s go Jacob.\"\n\nPeter says, leaving the room and motioning for you to follow.\n\n\"It\u0027s time for your interview.\"\n\nHe says with a laugh. You turn to Ian who motions for you to follow his brother, so you obey.\n","page 181":"You can\u0027t take his mocking, and you\u0027ll never get anywhere if you just continue to dodge, so you decide to fight back. You\u0027ll probably lose if it\u0027s a fight to win, but given this is an interview, maybe he just wants to see what you can do, you hope. This time, when he goes to punch you, you only move your head to dodge, and then quickly give him a punch back to the gut.\n\nPeter jumps back and smiles, putting his hand on his gut.\n\n\"Ha, you\u0027ll have to hit harder than that to hurt me.\"\n\nHe says mockingly. Luckily that was just a quick punch, and you can hit harder. This time you take the offensive and rush at him, which turns out to be a terrible mistake. Peter lifts his leg and kicks you in the chest, knocking you flat on your back, and the wind right out of you. Again he brings up his foot to stomp on you, but again you manage to roll out of the way. With a cough, you also manage to swing your legs around and kick him in the legs, knocking him off his feet. You then quickly stand up and back away, trying to catch your breath.\n\n\"Not bad Jacob, not bad.\"\n\nPeter says, standing up and brushing off his legs.\n\n\"You remind me of how Ian was when we used to fight. You pass.\"\n\nHe says with a smile.\n\n\"Welcome to the Wolves, kid.\"\n\nHe says, extending his hand. By now you\u0027ve caught your breath, so you shake his hand.\n\n\"Thanks, but I\u0027m not a kid.\"\n\nYou say, to which he laughs.\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose you\u0027re not.\"\n\nHe says. Now that you\u0027re a member of the Wolves, you figure you can ask him some questions about the gang.\n","page 180":"Peter leads you through the factory for a few minutes, until you\u0027re a good distance away from Ian and the others. The room he leads you to is basically just an open space, void of any furniture, and with the ground littered in garbage.\n\n\"Well, guess this is far enough.\"\n\nHe says, stopping in the middle of the room.\n\n\"First question, why do you want to join the Wolves?\"\n\nHe says, getting right to the questions. You\u0027re a bit put off by how formal this seems to be, but go along with it anyway.\n\n\"Because Ian\u0027s in it.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s it?\"\n\n\"Pretty much.\"\n\nYou reply. Peter thinks about your answer for minute before nodding.\n\n\"Alright, fair enough. The next question you\u0027ll have to answer with your fists though.\"\n\nHe says, putting his fists up in front of his face.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask, backing away slightly. What the hell does he mean you have to answer with your fists?\n\n\"Next question! Can you fight?\"\n\nPeter says loudly, rushing forward at you.\n\n\"What the hell!?\"\n\nYou yell, as he launches a punch with his right fist at your face. Your body intuitively has you dodge to the left, and you avoid his punch.\n\n\"Haha, not bad kid!\"\n\nHe says as he turns and pushes you to the ground. You don\u0027t even have time to care that he just called you a kid. He\u0027s too fast for you to dodge, and you fall to the ground. Peter then attempts to stomp on your stomach as you lie on your back, however you manage to roll away.\n\n\"Is dodging all you can do, Jacob?\"\n\nHe mocks as you stand up. You\u0027re sure in a straight fight you\u0027ll lose, but his mocking really gets to you.\n","page 183":"\"So, what do the Wolves do exactly?\"\n\nYou ask, curious. Peter shrugs in response.\n\n\"Nothing really, we\u0027re just a gang in name after all. You and Ian are still in school, and the rest of us all have legitimate jobs elsewhere.\"\n\nHe replies.\n\n\"Really, all the gang is, is an excuse to hang around in this abandoned warehouse haha.\"\n\n\"So, you don\u0027t like, do anything gang related?\"\n\n\"Nope, not a single thing. Well, every once in a while we\u0027ll get in a fight, but I wouldn\u0027t say that\u0027s gang related.\"\n\n\"I see...\"\n\nYou reply. You\u0027re happy that the Wolves don\u0027t appear to actually do anything bad. You figure this means Ian probably didn\u0027t get hindered by being in this gang.\n\n\"Did you really have to fight me to let me in?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Did you fight Ian?\"\n\n\"Naw, we used to play fight a bit, so I knew he could hold his own.\"\n\n\"Did you fight those other guys?\"\n\n\"Naw.\"\n\nYou glare at Peter as he laughs. He really didn\u0027t have to fight you at all.\n","page 182":"Deciding there\u0027s no point in even trying to fight this guy, you stick to dodging. He\u0027s just testing to see how you hold up in a fight anyway, so dodging should be enough. Peter goes in again to punch you, and you again dodge to the side. This pattern of him attacking and you dodging continues for what feels like an hour, but in reality is less than a few minutes. Eventually, Peter seems to get tired of attacking.\n\n\"Hm...Well I suppose being able to dodge this much means you can fight.\"\n\nHe says skeptically, putting his hand on the back of his head while thinking.\n\n\"There any reason you\u0027re not fighting back Jacob?\"\n\n\"Well, I\u0027d lose in the long run, so I figured dodging would be better.\"\n\n\"Hm...Alright, I\u0027ll accept that.\"\n\nHe replies with a nod.\n\n\"Welcome to the Wolves then.\"\n\nPeter says, extending his hand. You shake it back and thank him. Now that you\u0027re a member of the Wolves, you should probably ask him those questions you\u0027ve been wanting to ask.\n","page 185":"\"So, why did you make the Wolves?\"\n\nYou ask Peter, curious. One of the biggest things you\u0027ve been wondering, is why does this so called gang exist in the first place.\n\n\"Ah...that\u0027s a bit of a tough one.\"\n\nHe begins. After an awkward pause, he continues.\n\n\"Well, I suppose I made it as a home away from home, you know. Sometimes things happen and you just wanna go somewhere safe.\"\n\nHe answers.\n\n\"And sometimes, your house ain\u0027t one of those places.\"\n\nHe says solemnly. You\u0027re beginning to think there\u0027s a bit more to the creation of this gang than you originally thought.

Never really kept track. Honestly, for the first few years it was just me and Ian here haha.\"\n\nHe says with a forced laugh.\n\n\"But, now it looks like the wolves have finally become what we\u0027ve always wanted it to be.\"\n\n\"What\u0027s that?\"\n\n\"Ah, well, that\u0027s a question for later I suppose.\"\n\nHe answer, avoiding the question.\n","page 184":"\"So, why did you make the Wolves?\"\n\nYou ask Peter, curious.

You stop briefly in front of the door, and wonder if Peter is there. Shaking your head, you realize you don\u0027t care if he is anyway, and you open the door. Luckily, Ian seems to be the only one there, however he looks pretty upset.\n\n\"Hey Ian, so, uh, it looks like I can\u0027t be in the gang.\"\n\nYou say, trying to sound nonchalant. Ian just nods silently in response.\n\n\"Anyway, let\u0027s go hang out at my place.\"\n\nYou say, trying to change the topic. You can just ask Ian about his family again later. However Ian still just sits in his recliner silently.\n\n\"Sorry, Jacob.\"\n\nHe eventually says.\n\n\"I never told you this, but my family was never the greatest. We\u0027ve only been friends for under a year now, but it was a fun year.\"\n\nHe continues, in a sad tone.\n\n\"Sorry...if you just weren\u0027t accepted into the gang it\u0027d be one thing, but my brother says you can\u0027t be trusted.\"\n\nWhat? You can\u0027t be trusted? What the hell does asking questions about his family have to do with being trusted?\n\n\"And, I trust my brother more than I trust you...\"\n\nThat\u0027s only natural, but still, how can you not be trusted?\n\n\"Wait, what do you mean I can\u0027t be trusted?\"\n\n\"Simple. Peter says you don\u0027t trust the gang, so we can\u0027t trust you.\"\n\nIan says plainly, standing up. Well of course you didn\u0027t trust the gang. It\u0027s because of this gang that Ian\u0027s life got screwed up, you\u0027re sure of it.\n\n\"Wait, Ian...I-\"\n\nYou start, as Ian passes you.\n\n\"Sorry, man...see ya.\"\n\nHe says, leaving the room while avoiding eye contact. You consider trying to stop Ian and convince him you can be trusted, but quickly realize that won\u0027t work. Ian trusts his brother far more than he trusts you after all. You sigh as you collapse onto a nearby sofa. Ian, your one true friend that you have, has just told you you\u0027re no longer friends and that you can\u0027t be trusted. You never would have thought that going back in time would cause you to screw up your future even more than it already was.\n","page 19":"After reaching the front doors of the school, you wait a few minutes for Ian to show up. Sure enough, even without the two of you agreeing to meet before hand, he shows as expected. Then again, the front entrance of the school is the likely place for any student to leave from anyway.\n\n\"Yo, Jake.\"\n\nHe says casually as he approaches you. You give him a silent wave and match his pace as the two of you exit through the front doors.\n\n\"So, mind telling me what the hell was wrong with you today?\"\n\nIan says, apparently not at all convinced by you reassuring him you were fine this morning.\n\n\"It\u0027s.....really hard to explain.\"\n\n\"I get you, girl troubles right?\"\n\nYou laugh without thinking. While you had a girlfriend from time to time, in and after high school, it was never anything serious. The banality of his answer makes it so you can\u0027t help but laugh.\n\n\"I\u0027m almost positive that my troubles right now are not caused by a girl, Ian.\"\n\nYou reply, still smiling.\n\n\"Well, what is it then?\"\n\nIan is your best friend, both now in the past and in the future, but even so you don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be all too quick to believe you went back in time. You\u0027d like to say you went back in time, to tell him everything about the future, but something inside is stopping you. This internal struggle goes on for a few silent minutes before you finally shrug in response.\n\n\"I guess I\u0027ve just been thinking about the future a bit too hard lately.\"\n\nIs the best you can come up with. Even though it\u0027s quite accurate to the actual reason why, you still feel a bit down for lying to Ian. He seems to accept this as a proper response.\n\n\"Ah, yeah man, I get you. We only got a year to make the biggest choice of our lives. What are you thinking of being anyway?\"\n\n\"Anything but a stock boy.\"\n\nThe two of you share a laugh, and you spend the rest of the walk back to your house making small talk. The rest of the day passes by with nothing of interest really happening. At the end of the day you go to sleep and wonder if you\u0027ll wake up back in the future.\n","page 18":"Suddenly, as you reach the front entrance of the school, you remember you have detention. You sigh, not thrilled at the prospect of having to spend the next hour sitting in a class to make up for something you didn\u0027t even do intentionally. Ian approaches you from behind and then reaches your side, looking at your face as he does.\n\n\"We going?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I was late for my first class. I got detention...\"\n\nHe frowns, though he doesn\u0027t seem that shocked.\n\n\"Alright man, I told you to hurry there though.\"\n\n\"Yeah I know...Where is detention by the way?\"\n\n\"Er, Room 225...\"\n\nIan replies, confused that you don\u0027t seem to know something that obvious. He looks like he\u0027s about to address the issue, but you quickly thank him and head towards room 225, leaving him behind.\n\nSure enough, it\u0027s the correct room for detention. An older woman you don\u0027t recognize at all sits at the front of the room. She looks up from her book in time to give you a quick glance, then returns to reading. You put your bag at the side of the room and take a seat away from most of the other delinquents already in the room, not wanting to associate yourself with them. You\u0027re only here because you\u0027ve gone back in time after all, you\u0027re not like them.\n\nAs the minutes pass, you find yourself looking around the room for anything of interest, and quickly spot something, or rather someone. The gothic girl from your first class is also in the room, staring out the window and paying no attention at all to the others in the class. She\u0027s only two chairs over from you, and with no one between you and everyone else in the class already occupied, you figure you can use this time to talk to her. If you actually want to that is. It is detention after all, so if you\u0027re caught you\u0027d likely be punished.\n","page 15":"The rest of the day goes rather smoothly, sort of. Eventually, your body seems to fill in the blanks as to where you\u0027re supposed to be going, and you manage to find the rest of your classes for the day without issue. Unfortunately, Ian wasn\u0027t in any of your classes, and you got lost during the lunch break, so you\u0027ve spent the school day feeling incredibly awkward and alone.\n\nSadly, that\u0027s the least of your worries. You\u0027ve also spent the majority, or rather the entirety, of the day pondering over your current predicament. If you really have gone back in time, there\u0027s a lot you can do to improve your future, probably. While that\u0027s the conclusion you\u0027ve reached, you really have no idea where to start in order to \"fix\" your future. Sure being a stock-boy isn\u0027t a grand job, but what else can you actually do? What exactly is there to \"fix\"? Maybe you\u0027re just meant to live unhappily in the future. Maybe you should just enjoy your youth while you can, and accept your future.\n\nMaybe you can\u0027t even change anything. If fate is real, then any attempt you make to actually change the future should result in, well, nothing happening and the future merely correcting itself. At least, that\u0027s what you think. Truthfully, you have no idea what may or may not happen if you attempt to change anything. In fact, you being in the past means you\u0027re bound to do something different at some point anyway.\n\nPutting all that aside, even more questions come to mind, that you actually try to ignore. \"Why\" and \"how\" being the two most disturbing.

Sinister answers are the ones that come to the front of your mind, the most prominent one being that you\u0027ve somehow pissed off some supernatural being that has decided to make you loop through time forever, until you\u0027re driven insane.\n\nYou always were a pessimist. Although you try to shake it off as impossible, the idea of going back in time was also something you thought impossible up until recently, so you can\u0027t get rid of the idea completely.

He strokes his short beard while glaring at you.\n\n\"So, Jacob, I see you\u0027ve arrived late.\"\n\nHe says in a angry tone. Luckily, and unfortunately, it seems like this is in fact your current class, which makes you late. The rest of the class joins him in staring at you as you awkwardly nod in response. You\u0027ve never been particularly nervous in front of crowds, but you still dislike being the center of attention for a negative reason.\n\n\"I\u0027m sure you understand this means you will have detention after school today.\"\n\nHe continues in a demeaning tone. Again you nod in response and quickly take a seat, trying to ignore the majority of the stares in the class.\n\n\"Now then class, reviewing what we learned yesterday...\"\n\nThe teacher says, beginning his lecture as he turns to face the blackboard. You pay attention for the first few minutes, as a sort of apology for being late, but you quickly lose interest in the topic itself. If you really have gone back in time, then you already know all this anyway; at least that\u0027s the excuse you give yourself. You idly look around the room for anything that looks familiar as he drones on.\n\nYou sigh softly, thoroughly confused at your current situation and bored with this class. Eventually, you spot a girl in the corner of the room that you seem to recognize. Or, rather than recognize, you should say you feel like you know her, for some reason or another. No name comes to mind, nor any memories involving her, but for some reason you still think she\u0027s someone you know.\n\nLong, black hair, with brown eyes, and a slim figure. What\u0027s most noticeable about her though, is her gothic outfit of all black, complete with a spiked dog collar, and black painted finger nails. Looking at her closer, you determine that her black hair is probably dyed, your guess being her originally hair colour is a light brown. You brood over how you may know her, and your predicament as a whole, until the class finally ends. As the goth girl leaves she seems to ignore you completely. Maybe you don\u0027t know her?\n","page 29":"After a short search through the cafeteria, you find Ian sitting with a girl, with long black hair, brown eyes, and dressed in a goth outfit. Oddly enough, you recognize her as Olivia, the girl you were talking to in detention yesterday. Noticing you, Ian waves you over to their table.\n\n\"Hey man, this here is Olivia.\"\n\nHe says, motioning to Olivia.\n\n\"We\u0027re both in the chess club together it seems, so I figured I should hang out with her a bit to get to know her better.\"\n\nOlivia looks at you with a mild expression of surprise while Ian speaks, before scoffing at his remark.\n\n\"I have a boyfriend you know.\"\n\nShe states, apparently thinking Ian had an ulterior motive.\n\n\"Ah, well of course you do. A cute girl like you is quite the catch.\"\n\nIan replies, although you can sense he didn\u0027t really expect her to have one. Olivia blushes slightly, but it\u0027s unnoticed by Ian.\n\n\"That\u0027s right, I had forgotten you were in the chess club Ian.\"\n\nYou say, finally sitting down.\n\n\"Yep, I\u0027m the best damn chess-inator there is!\"\n\nHe replies while puffing out his chest with an odd sense of pride. However you don\u0027t really doubt he\u0027s the best there, as he\u0027s always been incredibly smart. You gaze wanders to Olivia, who notices and speaks.\n\n\"Just cause I look this way doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m stupid. Girls can be smart too, you know.\"\n\nShe says harshly to you, apparently thinking you were judging her inability to play chess based on her goth outfit. You quickly shake your head in response.\n\n\"I, wait, I never said you couldn\u0027t.\"\n\nYou said defensively. She turns her head away from you, almost in disgust. Ian looks at the two of you confused.\n\n\"Am I missing something here? Do you two got some history or something?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. We just met yesterday after all. Didn\u0027t we, Jacob?\"\n\nOlivia replies angrily, even more upset now.\n\n\"I need to go.\"\n\nShe announces, quickly standing from the table and walking away. The two of you watch as she leaves and Ian shrugs as you turn to him.\n\n\"Girls man. Confusing as hell, right?\"\n\nHe says before taking a drink of his milk in front of him. You nod, but can\u0027t help but think there was something more to what Olivia said.\n","page 22":"You wake up to a brand new day, and to a familiar sight. Sure enough, you\u0027re still in the past, in your old bedroom. You get up, get dressed, and make your way downstairs to eat some breakfast. There you find your sister, already ready for her school, eating a waffle. She looks up at you and you can tell she\u0027s a bit surprised to see you up already, but you ignore it and grab a poptart for yourself. As you munch on it, you can feel Tina\u0027s eyes staring at you.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask, slightly annoyed. She visibly flinches at your question and quickly returns her gaze to her waffle. The two of you never really got along, before and after she entered high school, so this kind of interaction is normal.

You could get in even more trouble after all, and you probably don\u0027t even know her. Detention passes by slowly, but eventually you\u0027re dismissed. Ian is already long gone by the time you return to the front lobby, so you go back home alone.\n\nAlong the way you try to retrace your steps from this morning, and although you go down a wrong alley or two, you eventually make it home. Of course, your mother is noticeably upset you are hours late from school.\n\n\"So Jacob. Mind explaining why you have come home at such at late hour?\"\n\nYour mother asks impatiently as you enter the house, two hours after you should have been home.\n\n\"I...err...sort of had detention.\"\n\nYou reply.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I was late for my first class....\"\n\nYour mother seems annoyed, but doesn\u0027t push the matter too much further.\n\n\"Honestly Jacob, you won\u0027t ever succeed in life if you don\u0027t take things seriously.

She smiles again once she notices you, but rather than approach you, chooses to go outside. Instinctively you follow her out to the bench she is now sitting on.\n\n\"So...\"\n\nYou begin, cautiously taking a seat beside her on the bench.\n\n\"I don\u0027t I know you, do I? I mean, it feels like we\u0027ve met before.\"\n\nYou ask, recalling that you asked Olivia the same thing yesterday. Why does it seem like you know but can\u0027t remember so many people in this school?\n\n\"Hmmm. You could ask far more interesting questions than that.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"Why I\u0027m here, how I\u0027m here, who I\u0027m here for; all are far more interesting questions.\"\n\nShe says. You silently sit together, unable to come up with a proper response for her rather odd answer. Sensing that won\u0027t change soon, Allison sighs then speaks again.\n\n\"We just met now, correct? So it\u0027s safe to say it\u0027s our first meeting.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"If you believe in a linear concept of time that is.\"\n\nAllison adds in a playful tone. You frown, having no idea what she\u0027s going on about. Her answer puts you a bit at ease though. You haven\u0027t met before, according to her, so maybe you\u0027re just imagining things. Maybe your dream of her wasn\u0027t really about her then. As you think she stands up and walks a few feet away from you.\n\n\"For the love long since lost, the old friend forgotten, the new one neglected, the sister he could never see, and the brother he could never be.\"\n\nAllison says suddenly, bending forward and leaning in your direction.\n\n\"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\"\n\nShe says smiling, she then quickly runs away before you have a chance to question her about her cryptic message.\n\nJust who is that girl...\n\nYou wonder, shaking your head.\n","page 25":"You first class begins, but instead of teaching like normal, your teacher just stands at the front of the class beside the door.\n\n\"Today, a new student will be joining us\".\n\nHe says. As he does the new student enters the room. You see a pretty girl with familiar long blonde and pink hair flowing down to just above her waist. A realization hits you as the teacher introduces her.\n\n\"This is Allison- Jacob, what are you doing?\"\n\nHe asks annoyed, as you stand up and point to Allison with you mouth open. This is the girl you saw in your dream the other day. Her features are far more defined than they were in then, but this is unmistakably the same girl. She smiles at you, amused at your action, while the rest of the quietly giggles.\n\n\"I, um, her, ah never mind...\"\n\nYou say, returning to your seat flustered. You find it rather doubtful that the teacher will care you saw her in your dream. Rather he, Allison and the rest of the class would no doubt find it creepy.\n\n\"Alright, Allison, please find a seat.\"\n\nThe teacher says, and Allison walks over to an empty seat at the back of the room, flashing you another smile as she passes you. A familiar feeling you\u0027ve been getting all too often reoccurs. Do you know Allison?\n","page 27":"You chase Allison into the lunch room and grab her hand as you catch up, stopping her from running.

No one acts that friendly to someone they just met, and what you just said before sounds like it has some deeper meaning to it.\"\n\nYou say. Allison looks down to her hand, which you immediately let go of, then she glances around the room. Finally she sighs.\n\n\"You caught me. I know you. But the more important thing here, isn\u0027t what I know, but what you know. So, what do you know of me, Jacob?\"\n\nAllison replies, revealing that your guess was right. Unfortunately, you don\u0027t actually know anything about her. The closest you have to a memory of her is your dream, and even if she does actually know you, that\u0027d be a rather odd thing to bring up. Then again, she seems like a rather odd person anyway.\n\n\"How do you know me?\"\n\nYou ask, trying to ignore her question. She pouts and takes a step back.\n\n\"Beep beep, wrong answer. Should I take this to mean you don\u0027t know anything about me?\"\n\nShe asks.\n","page 20":"You decide to take the chance and go for it. The gnawing feelings inside of you that say you know her are too much to ignore, especially in this situation. You wait for a moment when the older woman at the front of the room seems engrossed in her book, and gracefully move over to the chair beside the gothic girl. With all the grace of a stampeding elephant that is. Not only do you turn over the desk your were previously sitting in, you manage to miss sitting in the other desk, and fall to the ground.\n\nThe class uproars in laughter before they are hastily shushed by the older woman at the front. You sheepishly smile and turn back your original chair to its original position, then sit in the one beside the goth girl. The woman at the front glares at you for what feels like eternity, before finally returning to her book. Meanwhile, the girl beside you is now turned towards you and glaring at you.\n\nMustering your courage, you finally speak, or rather whisper, to her.\n\n\"Hey, I\u0027m Jacob.\"\n\nYou say, darting a quick glance at the front to make sure you did it without being caught. The girl continues silently starting at you for a moment before replying.\n\n\"Olivia.\"\n\n\"Hey, Olivia. So, this is a bit forward, but I could swear I know you from somewhere.\"\n\nYou say.\n\n\"Have we, like, met before or something?\"\n\nOlivia looks to the front of the room, then back to you and shrugs.\n\n\"If we had, I\u0027d probably be offended you forgot about me.\"\n\nShe states with an apathetic tone. Though, if someone you knew had asked if they knew you, you\u0027d certainly be offended they had forgotten as well.\n\n\"Well, nice to meet you then.\"\n\nYou say, extending your hand. She slowly extends her own hand and shakes yours.\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll get along like the bestest of friends.\"\n\nOlivia says sarcastically. She then turns her attention back to the window, effectively ignoring you. Detention ends without too much else happening.

You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n“Hey Jake.”\n\n“Hey Ian, ready for another exciting day?” You ask sarcastically.\n\n“Oh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.” He replies with equal sarcasm, “I hope I never quit.”\n\n“Ah yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn’t it?”\n\n“A lifelong-dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to live that dream.”\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there’s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it’s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o’clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.\n","page 202":"Peter leads you back to the side-room office, and the two of you enter together. The four inside, Ian and the other three members of the Wolves, look up from what they\u0027re doing, and anxiously wait for Peter to speak.\n\n\"He\u0027s in. Jacob is now a wolf!\"\n\nHe says, and then in a dramatic manner, lifts up your arm. You try and play along, but find it hard to really care all that much that you\u0027re in the Wolves. Ian walks up and congratulates you, and you spend the next few hours getting to know the rest of the group. All of them, as you expected, have some sort of family issue, which caused them to cut ties with their families and join the Wolves. They all work, in fact their jobs are within 10 minutes of this building, but most don\u0027t take their jobs too seriously, and seem to just live day by day. You start to wonder if maybe this mentality is the reason Ian turned out the way he did.\n\nEventually, the day ends and everyone says their goodbyes. All in all you don\u0027t think any of them are bad people, just a bit rough on the edges. With that in mind, you walk back to your house with Ian and wonder about what you can do to help fix his future.\n\n\"Hey Ian?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"What are you going to try and do after you graduate?\"\n\nYou ask, trying to confirm something. Ian ponders for a minute before answer.\n\n\"That\u0027s a pretty heavy question. I suppose I\u0027m going to try to become a doctor though. Gotta make sure I ace these last exams to get a good scholarship though.\"\n\nHe replies, and you confirm that he does in fact care about his future. But that just confuses you even more, because if this is the way he feels, he should never had ended up like you did.\n\n\"Really? A doctor?\"\n\n\"Yep, why\u0027d you want to know?\"\n\n\"Ah, no real reason, I was just curious since you\u0027re smart and all.\"\n\nYou lie.\n\n\"Oh, well alright then.\"\n\nIan replies, thinking that\u0027s the end of the conversation.\n","page 204":"You lay in your bed Wednesday morning and ponder what happened to Ian.

However, your feeling still warrants some sort of action, so you head to Ian\u0027s house. Once there you find it to be, well, abandoned. No one is inside, and it seems to be really unkempt. If Ian isn\u0027t here there\u0027s only one other place you think he can be - the abandoned warehouse.\n\nFrom his house you make your way to the \u0027wolf den\u0027. By the time you actually reach the place, it\u0027s almost 9:00am. You enter the warehouse and immediately hear an ear-piercing scream. After hearing that, you sprint the rest of the way, and enter the small office to find something you never would have expected.\n\nInside the room, are five people you\u0027ve never met, four guys and a girl, all appearing to be in their early to mid twenties, and all rather obviously belonging to some sort of gang. Apart from them, Ian and Peter are also in the room. Ian looks rather beat up, and Peter currently stands above one of the other guys, with a knife in his hand. The knife drips blood from his hand down to the body of the guy. The four remaining unknown people stare at Peter in fear and shock, before quickly running past you out of the room as you stare in shock.\n\nShit...\n\nYou think as you stare at the dumbfounded Ian and his brother. You were wrong. It was never the gang that screwed up his life, it was this incident. A flood of memories rush to your head, as you remember Ian telling you one day that his brother was sent to jail for murder. In his grief, he had flunked every one of his test. No, you\u0027re not even sure he took any of them. Peter falls to the ground and desperately shakes the body of the man he just killed, and begins crying. Ian can do nothing more than look back between his brother and you, as if pleading for one of you to explain what going on.\n\nYou screwed up. You couldn\u0027t be there to help Ian like he needed you to be. You try and console him, but Ian isn\u0027t able to fully cope. His brother is sent to jail, and history repeats itself, with you and him ending up right back at the same store you worked at in the future before.\n","page 205":"Classes throughout the day go as normal, however during lunch you decide to let Ian and Olivia eat without you, primarily because you don\u0027t want to deal with her getting mad at you. This leaves you free during the lunch hour, at least that would have been the case, had Allison not decided to join you.\n\n\"Hey Jacob, so what\u0027s new?\"\n\nShe asks, taking a seat across from you.\n\n\"Um, hi Allison. Not much...\"\n\nYou reply, rather confused that Allison is sitting with you.\n\n\"Is there a reason-\"\n\nYou begin, but Allison cuts you off.\n\n\"This will probably confuse you a bit, but just listen.\"\n\nSlowly, you nod your head.\n\n\"Good, that feeling you have now is right. When the time comes, use your instinct to determine what to do. Trust me.\"\n\nShe says, then after confirming you understood her, she stands up.\n\n\"That\u0027s all. Good luck!\"\n\nAllison says in a happy manner with a smile as she leaves, although as she said, you\u0027re left really confused. How can she possibly know what you\u0027re feeling right now? You barely even know her. Remembering how strange of a girl she is though, you decide it\u0027s best to just ignore what she said for now. It\u0027s not like you really need to be told to follow your own instinct anyway.\n\nThe day ends and again after school you refuse to go to the \u0027wolf den\u0027 with Ian. He seems a bit put off, but doesn\u0027t protest too much. On Thursday the same pattern occurs, with you refusing to go with him in the morning, and insisting you don\u0027t go together after school. Yet again Ian seems reluctant to agree with you, but eventually agrees not to go to the warehouse.\n\nHowever, when Friday comes something different happens. You exit your house in the morning, to find that Ian is no where to be found. The time is currently about 8:00am, so he should be here by now. A sickening feeling comes to your stomach, as you somehow realize this is probably the day something really bad happens.\n","page 33":"After a short search through the cafeteria, you find Ian sitting with a girl, with long black hair, brown eyes, and dressed in a goth outfit. Oddly enough, you recognize her as Olivia, the girl you were talking to in detention yesterday. Noticing you, Ian waves you over to their table.\n\n\"Hey man, this here is Olivia.\"\n\nHe says, motioning to Olivia.\n\n\"We\u0027re both in the chess club together it seems, so I figured I should hang out with her a bit to get to know her better.\"\n\nOlivia looks at you with a mild expression of surprise while Ian speaks, before scoffing at his remark.\n\n\"I have a boyfriend you know.\"\n\nShe states, apparently thinking Ian had an ulterior motive.\n\n\"Ah, well of course you do. A cute girl like you is quite the catch.\"\n\nIan replies, although you can sense he didn\u0027t really expect her to have one. Olivia blushes slightly, but it\u0027s unnoticed by Ian.\n\n\"That\u0027s right, I had forgotten you were in the chess club Ian.\"\n\nYou say, finally sitting down.\n\n\"Yep, I\u0027m the best damn chess-inator there is!\"\n\nHe replies while puffing out his chest with an odd sense of pride. However you don\u0027t really doubt he\u0027s the best there, as he\u0027s always been incredibly smart. You gaze wanders to Olivia, who notices and speaks.\n\n\"Just cause I look this way doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m stupid. Girls can be smart too, you know.\"\n\nShe says harshly to you, apparently thinking you were judging her inability to play chess based on her goth outfit. You quickly shake your head in response.\n\n\"I, wait, I never said you couldn\u0027t.\"\n\nYou said defensively. She turns her head away from you, almost in disgust. Ian looks at the two of you confused.\n\n\"Am I missing something here? Do you two got some history or something?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. We just met yesterday after all. Didn\u0027t we, Jacob?\"\n\nOlivia replies angrily, even more upset now.\n\n\"I need to go.\"\n\nShe announces, quickly standing from the table and walking away. The two of you watch as she leaves and Ian shrugs as you turn to him.\n\n\"Girls man. Confusing as hell, right?\"\n\nHe says before taking a drink of his milk in front of him. You nod, but can\u0027t help but think there was something more to what Olivia said.\n","page 208":"Trusting your instinct like Allison recommended, you turn towards the \u0027Wolf den\u0027 and begin sprinting there. You\u0027re not sure why you think you need to get there so quickly, but you follow you gut and run. Odd flashes of jumbled memories run through your mind as you do, but you\u0027re unable to make any sense of them. Once at the front of the warehouse, you burst through the doors and keep running, all the way until the front of the side room office door. You take a deep breath, and open the door, preparing yourself for what may be on the other side.\n\nAnd upon opening the door, you see Ian and Peter calmly resting inside. The look up at you with confused expressions, as you stand in the doorway breathing heavily.\n\n\"I...thought...\"\n\nYou manage to say in between breaths.\n\n\"You alright man?\"\n\nIan ask worried, standing up and putting his hand on your shoulder. Unable to speak for the moment, you simply nod and take a seat. After a few minutes of catching your breath, you finally are able to speak. Now you have Ian and Peter looking at you expectantly, but what can you really say? You had a bad feeling, so you ran as fast as you can? You begin to curse your stupidity at taking a bad feeling so seriously, when suddenly the three of you hear the door open.\n\nIn front of you stands four people, three guys and a girl, all appearing to be in their early to mid twenties, and all dressed in apparel that would imply they two are part of a gang.\n\n\"The fuck do you guys want?\"\n\nPeter says standing up, confirming your suspicion. As he does more memories flood through your head, but this time you can actually make sense of it. Peter kills one of them, with a knife, is what you get out of the memories. You\u0027re not sure exactly how, but you recall a time in the future when Ian tells you his brother was put in jail for killing someone with a knife while protecting him. With his only family member gone, Ian feel into despair, and was unable to take his final exams, let alone ace them to get a proper scholarship.\n\nYou did nothing, and you knew nothing. Looking back, it was pretty obvious Ian\u0027s home life was bad, but you had never asked about it. You had never really cared, is what you now realize. Ian was your only real friend at this point in time, yet you never really treated him like one. You were never there when he needed you.\n\nYou clench your fists in frustration at your past self, and bring your attention back to the issue. You need to prevent Peter from stabbing one of them. No, you need to somehow resolve this conflict without anything bad happening to anyone, that\u0027s the only way for sure you can prevent the future from happening.\n\n\"We gave you your weeks notice, yet you\u0027re still here. Get out.\"\n\nThe apparent leader says.\n\n\"Fuck off.\"\n\nIs the reply he gets from Peter. The three guys size the three of you up, with the girl seemingly having no intention of fighting as well. Looking at each other for nods of approval, the appear to reach a decision.\n\n\"Well then, I guess we\u0027ll have to personally evict you folk.\"\n\nThe leader says with a malicious grin.\n","page 32":"After a short search in the cafeteria you find Ian sitting at a table together with a girl, who has long black hair, brown eyes, and a goth outfit.

Well of course you do, you\u0027re a pretty girl after all.\"\n\nIan replies, though you can sense he didn\u0027t really expect her to have one. Olivia blushes slightly, but it\u0027s unnoticed by Ian.\n\n\"That\u0027s right, I had forgotten you were in the chess club, Ian.\"\n\nYou say, taking a seat beside him.

Finally, Olivia notices you looking at her, and by now it seems you\u0027ve been looking at her long enough to be considered staring.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe asks, slightly annoyed.\n\n\"Ah, nothing. I was just thinking you kind of look familiar. Like we knew each other or something.\"\n\nYou reply instinctively. Olivia seems to think what you said over very carefully, causing a moment of awkward silence between the three of you.\n\n\"I guess not.\"\n\nShe replies with a short shrug.\n\nIan looks at the two of you before trying to lighten the mood.\n\n\"Well then, allow me to formally introduce you two...again! Jacob, this is Olivia, Olivia, this is Jacob.\"\n\nIan announces in a grand fashion. Olivia suddenly stands up.\n\n\"Sorry, I have to go now.\"\n\nShe says, with a hint of sadness.\n\n\"Alright then, see ya later Olivia.\"\n\nIan replies, taken a bit off guard. The two of you watch as she walks away, then continue eating. You can\u0027t help but wonder if you really did know each other or not.\n","page 207":"Deciding there\u0027s no need to panic, you head to school anyway. Ian is probably just skipping to hang out at the Wolves hideout, so there\u0027s no reason for you to be alarmed.\n\nHowever, that turns out to not be the case. You don\u0027t see Ian for well over a week, and when you finally do you can see bruise marks on his face from some sort of fight. When you asked what happened, he explains that the other gang he talked about earlier had raided their hideout, and during the fight Peter had stabbed and killed one of them. The sickening feeling you had before comes back to you, as you realize that this must have been the event that screwed up Ian\u0027s life. Unfortunately, it\u0027s too late for you to help now.\n\nIan explains that his brother has been sent to jail, and while you try to help him through the situation, the grief is too much for him, and the two of you end up going down the exact same path you had in the future.\n","page 35":"You sigh and nod.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry.

Maybe we\u0027ll get to know each other better in the future.\"\n\nAllison says, waving and walking away. You give her a short wave back and then decide to have something for lunch, and to maybe find Ian.

You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n“Hey Jake.”\n\n“Hey Ian, ready for another exciting day?” You ask sarcastically.\n\n“Oh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.” He replies with equal sarcasm, “I hope I never quit.”\n\n“Ah yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn’t it?”\n\n“A lifelong-dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to live that dream.”\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there’s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it’s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o’clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.\n","page 37":"Thinking it over, you decide it\u0027s better if you don\u0027t miss school today. You\u0027d miss your chance to talk to Olivia or Allison if you did after all.\n\n\"Sorry, I think I\u0027ll just go to school, Ian. See ya.\"\n\nYou say, walking onwards without him.\n\n\"Alright then, your loss man. Later.\"\n\nIan replies with shrug and a wave. He then turns and goes his own way. The walk to school is uneventful, and surprisingly when you arrive you find that Allison isn\u0027t there in your first class. Olivia is there as per normal, and she seems to ignore your presence, although you occasionally catch her glancing at you. The class itself is boring, and you start to regret not skipping it with Ian. However, once it ends and you finally have spare time, you jump up and approach the teacher.\n\n\"Hey, um, Mr...\"\n\nYou begin, however the realization hits you that you don\u0027t actually know his name, so you quickly just ask your question.\n\n\"Why isn\u0027t Allison at school today?\"\n\nYour teacher looks at you confused.\n\n\"Allison?\"\n\nHe asks. A brief moment of panic comes over you where you think you may have imagined her entirely. Then the teacher begins to speak again.\n\n\"Ah, the new girl that joined us yesterday...\"\n\nHe says. Internally you breathe a sigh of relief, happy to know you haven\u0027t gone insane.\n\n\"Yes, it appears she is absent today. Strange, she only just started yesterday...\"\n\nHe continues. You thank him and quickly exit the room. In the hall, you can see Olivia making her way towards the cafeteria.\n","page 36":"\"Alright fine, I\u0027ll come with you.\"\n\nYou reply somewhat grudgingly, trying to mask your interest. Fortunately, your mother had already left for work, taking your sister with her, so you easily return your bag to your closet without being caught. During the walk to the unknown destination, you and Ian converse.\n\n\"So, now that I\u0027ve agreed, care to let me in on where we\u0027re headed?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"You\u0027ll see when we get there.\"\n\nHe replies with a smile. You glare at him, annoyed that he refuses to tell you, but continue to walk along with him. After a short walk he stops in front of what looks to be an abandoned warehouse. You glance at him then to the building.\n\n\"Seriously? This is it?\"\n\nYou ask, clearly disappointed. A worn down and dangerous building isn\u0027t exactly your idea of fun, and it doesn\u0027t really fit Ian\u0027s either.\n\n\"You\u0027ll change your mind about it once we\u0027re inside.\"\n\nHe says, leading the way. You follow him into it, although you\u0027re rather doubtful your opinion will change. Sure enough, once you follow him through the main door, all you see is a large run-down warehouse, exactly like you expected.\n\n\"Come on, what are we even doing here Ian?\"\n\nYou ask, suddenly feeling a bit uneasy about the situation.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry man, just a little further.\"\n\nHe says, leading you through the large room and into a side-room. In the side room, which appears to have previously been an office of some sort, you see signs that it was recently used. In fact the furniture inside seems rather new, and there\u0027s even a mini-fridge at the side, plugged into a battery pack. Ian hops onto a large, comfortable looking couch, and then smiles.\n\n\"Welcome to the wolves.\"\n","page 39":"\"No.\"\n\nYou reply bluntly.\n\n\"And you shouldn\u0027t be in it either man. The hell is wrong with you?\"\n\nYou say, your voice getting louder. Ian at this points backs away a step, and seems a bit afraid.\n\n\"You\u0027re fucking smart man. Why the hell would you throw that away by being in a gang? You won\u0027t -\"\n\nYou yell, then you suddenly stop. \u0027You won\u0027t go anywhere in life\u0027, is what you were about to say, but then it dawns on you that that is exactly what happens. He joins you, doing nothing with his life, as a stock boy. Your anger subsides, and your breathing normalizes, but Ian still keeps his distance.\n\n\"I...I\u0027m sorry.\"\n\nYou say in a dejected tone, apologizing. You contemplate saying more, but decide against it. Slowly, you open the office door and exit the room.\n\n\"I\u0027ll see you later.\"\n\nYou say. Ian doesn\u0027t say anything in return, nor does he try to stop you. You leave the abandoned warehouse and wander around town for the rest of the day, wondering what you can do to help Ian.\n\nAlong the way you run into a group of girls, wearing a uniform you recognize as the one from the school your sister goes to. They laugh obnoxiously and talk about some other girl in their class. You sigh loudly, annoyed by their interruption of your thought process, but continue walking rather than confront them.\n\nBy the end of the day, you return home, hungry and without any real solution to how to help Ian. You\u0027ve concluded that there\u0027s nothing you can really do to talk him out of being in the gang. Although you think you probably should have asked him why he\u0027s in it before leaving. You eat dinner and go to bed, your mom and sister blissfully ignorant of your day out. You glance at your alarm clock before dozing off, happy that tomorrow is Saturday.\n","page 38":"\"The what?\"\n\nYou ask, thoroughly confused. You don\u0027t remember anything like this happening in the past. Maybe your decisions have been different from before, leading you to a different outcome. The possibilities run through your mind before Ian snaps you out of it.\n\n\"The Wolves man. Our gang. Well, you\u0027re not really in them yet, but I\u0027m sure my brother won\u0027t have a problem with it.\"\n\nIan says, standing up and opening the mini-fridge, pulling out a beer.\n\n\"Want one?\"\n\nHe asks casually. You don\u0027t really care that he\u0027s drinking while under aged, but this isn\u0027t how you remember Ian acting.\n\n\"No...\"\n\nYou reply slowly.\n\n\"Actually, what the hell is going on? Since when have you been in a gang?\"\n\nYou ask demanding an answer. Ian doesn\u0027t seem too put off by your response. It\u0027s almost as though he expected it.\n\n\"Ah well, I\u0027ve been telling you about this club for the last few days. I mean I never said it was a gang or anything, but it shouldn\u0027t come as that much of a surprise.\"\n\nHe replies.  That\u0027s when it hits you. The stories he was saying involving his brother that you largely ignored were about the gang he was in. Most likely he was trying to talk it up a bit before bringing you here. Still, Ian has a great future ahead of him, so he really has no need to be in a gang.\n\n\"So, you in man?\"\n\nHe asks, with a bit of hesitance.\n","page 31":"You sigh and nod.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry. I don\u0027t really know you.\"\n\nYou reply. Unexpectedly, she smiles and nods in response.\n\n\"Well, that\u0027s to be expected. We only just met after all. Maybe we\u0027ll get to know each other better in the future.\"\n\nAllison says, waving and walking away. You give her a short wave back and then decide to have something for lunch, and to maybe find Ian. After a short search through the cafeteria, you find Ian sitting with a girl, with long black hair, brown eyes, and dressed in a goth outfit. Oddly enough, you recognize her as Olivia, the girl you were talking with in detention yesterday. Noticing you, Ian waves you over to their table.\n\n\"Hey man, this here is Olivia.\"\n\nHe says, motioning to Olivia.\n\n\"We\u0027re both in the chess club together it seems, so I figured I should hang out with her a bit to get to know her better.\"\n\nOlivia looks at you with a mild expression of surprise while Ian speaks, before scoffing at his remark.\n\n\"I have a boyfriend you know.\"\n\nShe states, apparently thinking Ian has an ulterior motive.\n\n\"Ah, well of course you do. A cute girl like you is quite the catch.\"\n\nIan replies, although you can sense he didn\u0027t really expect her to have one. Olivia blushes slightly, but it\u0027s unnoticed by Ian.\n\n\"That\u0027s right, I had forgotten you were in the chess club Ian.\"\n\nYou say, finally sitting down.\n\n\"Yep, I\u0027m the best damn chess-inator there is!\"\n\nHe replies while puffing out his chest with an odd sense of pride. However you don\u0027t really doubt he\u0027s the best there, as he\u0027s always been incredibly smart. You gaze wanders to Olivia, who notices and speaks.\n\n\"Just cause I look this way doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m stupid. Girls can be smart too you know.\"\n\nShe says harshly to you, apparently thinking you were judging her ability to play chess based on her goth outfit. You quickly shake your head in response.\n\n\"I, wait, I never said you couldn\u0027t.\"\n\nYou reply defensively. She turns her head away from you, almost in disgust. Ian looks at the two of you confused.\n\n\"Am I missing something here? Do you two got some history or something?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. We just met yesterday after all. Didn\u0027t we Jacob?\"\n\nOlivia replies angrily, even more upset now. You go to answer but she quickly speaks again.\n\n\"I need to go.\"\n\nShe announces, quickly standing from the table and walking away. The two of you watch as she leaves.Ian shrugs as you turn to him.\n\n\"Girls man. Confusing as hell, right?\"\n\nHe says before taking a drink of his milk in front of him. You nod, but can\u0027t help but think there was something more to what Olivia said.\n","page 30":"\"That\u0027s not entirely true...\"\n\nYou reply to her. Curious, she takes a step towards you.\n\n\"So, what do you know about me then?\"\n\nAllison asks.\n\n\"I, um, well, it was just a dream.\"\n\nYou begin.\n\n\"I saw you, at least I think it was you, in a hallway of the school. You ran and I chased you, and then...\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\nShe asks.\n\n\"And nothing. The dream just ended after I chased you.\"\n\n\"Hmmmm...\"\n\nShe replies, clearly thinking about what you just said.\n\n\"So, when was this dream?\"\n\n\"Just the other day...\"\n\nYou reply, leaving out the part that you actually dreamt it 8 years in the future. Allison appears to be thinking deeply again. Then she suddenly giggles.\n\n\"That\u0027s kind of creepy to be honest.\"\n\nYou almost grasp your chest in response to that critical hit of an insult. Sure enough, she finds it weird and creepy that you would have dreamt about her.\n\n\"Well, I suppose it\u0027s not that bad. Even creeps and geeks have their own appeal after all.\"\n\nShe continues, teasing you.\n\n\"Catch ya later.\"\n\nAllison says, waving and walking away. You give her a short wave back and sigh, unhappy with the results of your conversation. Even so, you decide to hang out in the lunch room longer and have something to eat.\n","page 44":"You happily decide to sleep in, it\u0027s Saturday after all. You do the same as all teenagers in high school do, sleep as much as possible.\n\nOr rather, you would have spent it sleeping, had you not been rudely awoken at about two by someone knocking on your front door. You groan as you exit your bed and move downstairs to answer the door.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask angrily as you open it, only to find Allison happily standing in front of you. She smiles as you open the door.\n\n\"Why hello there, Jacob, or should I say good morning?\"\n\nShe says cheekily. You open your mouth to retort, but she interrupts you.\n\n\"Anyway, I\u0027ve been out here for a while, so can I come it?\"\n\nShe continues, you go to reply, but she again interrupts you.\n\n\"What do you mean no? Would you really leave a cute girl outside in the cold?\"\n\nYou stand silently and glare at her as she attempts to make a cute pose.\n\n\"...Done?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n","page 43":"Remembering your mother\u0027s words, you quickly spring to life early in the morning, and prepare to take your sister to school. Though, all that really involves is you walking a few blocks with her. Although you should have your license at this age (and after a quick check you confirm you do), your mother has the only vehicle, so driving your sister is out of the question. After getting ready you exit your door to find Tina standing there, her fist seemingly prepared to knock. An awkward moment of silence follows as you look at her, contemplating why you two never talk in the future.\n\n\"We...have to go soon.\"\n\nShe manages to say, looking down at the ground to avoid eye contact. Why the hell does it seem like she\u0027s afraid? It annoys you, but you try to ignore it. Your own sister, afraid of you.\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go.\"\n\nYou say, walking past her and towards the door. Come to think of it, you moved around a few times while you were a child, and a good portion of it was due to her. Even though Ian is your best friend, now and in the future, you had only become friends with him a year ago at this point in time. You had lived here before, years ago when you were a child, but you had to moved because of your father\u0027s work. You moved back eventually, but it was only due to Tina getting accepted into the private school she\u0027s currently attending.\n\nFinally ready, the two of you exit the house and begin the walk towards her school. It\u0027s done mainly in silence, and as you get closer to the school, she seems to unconsciously move closer to you, distancing herself again whenever you notice. It always annoyed you how quiet and shy she seemed to be. Once at the school\u0027s large and elegant gates, you stop.\n\n\"There, have fun at school.\"\n\nYou say, as you begin to walk away.\n\n\"U-um...\"\n\nYou hear a small voice say behind you as you go to walk.\n\n\"Can you pick me up after...after school...?\"\n\nYou hear your sister request. Turning to her you sigh.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nYou ask in an obviously annoyed tone. Tina nervously moves back as she clutches her bag.\n\n\"Just because...\"\n","page 46":"You briskly walk down the hall and catch up with Olivia. As you do, you recall that the last time the two of you talked, she was rather hostile with you.\n\n\"Hey Olivia, listen, I\u0027m sorry if I offended you or something.\"\n\nYou say, attempting to mend whatever you broke earlier.\n\n\"Can\u0027t we just start fresh? Forget whatever I did to make you angry?\n\nYou ask hopeful, extending your hand to her. She glances at it, then at you, and sighs.\n\n\"Sure, why not. Forgetting things seems to be a pattern for us anyway.\"\n\nOlivia replies, shaking your hand gently. You smile in response, though her off-hand sarcastic remark confuses you slightly.\n\n\"So, where are you headed off to?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"To the lunchroom, it\u0027s lunch time after all.\"\n\nOlivia responds, rather impassively.\n\n\"Fair enough, so, mind if I sit with you?\"\n\nYou ask, hoping you can maybe find out more about her.

As you approach your seats, you think over what you should talk to her about.\n","page 45":"More concerned about where Allison could be than school, you decide to look for her. With that in mind, you really have no idea as to where she could be. Your initial search is just around your high school, in the usual spots you might expect to find someone. The library, cafeteria, gym, courtyard, and the outside field all turn up nothing. If nothing else, it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s not at school. Undeterred, you decide this is a good time to skip school to continue your search.\n\nYou find yourself aimlessly walking around town in search of a girl you hardly even know. Sometime during your search, you find yourself wondering why you care so much about finding her. Do you intuitively know something is wrong and must find her? No, that can\u0027t be right, you don\u0027t think anything in particular is wrong with the situation. You were about to skip school yourself today, so it\u0027s not that big a deal that Allison would skip.\n\nThen, maybe you\u0027re just drawn to her? She is an odd one after all, so it\u0027s only natural you\u0027d be curious about her. There\u0027s also the matter of her probably knowing more than she lets on. Maybe she even knows about your current predicament...\n\n\"For the love long since lost, the old friend forgotten, the new one neglected, the sister he could never see, and the brother he could never be.\"\n\nWere the words she said to you when you first approached her. You hadn\u0027t really considered any real deep meaning to them, but considering your circumstances, it probably has to do with you. Then, which are you, and for that matter, who is she? Does she actually know that you went back in time, or is this simply a large coincidence? You shake your head a bit. It\u0027s probably better if you just ask her again what she meant by all of that when you find her.\n\nAs your mind was wandering, your feet were still moving. You now find yourself outside of your sister\u0027s private high school, oddly enough. You guess it\u0027s about time school was over, as students seem to be exiting the school in an orderly fashion. That would mean that you spent three hours looking for Allison with no results. You sigh to yourself, although not finding her really should have been expected.\n\nYou\u0027re about to leave the grounds when you notice your sister walk out. Tina exits the front doors of school looking rather nervous, a normal sight with her it would seem. Thinking you should probably head home now, you turn to leave, when you notice a group of students approach her.\n","page 48":"You make your way down the hallway and catch up with Olivia.\n\n\"So, where you headed off to?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"To the lunchroom, it\u0027s lunch time after all.\"\n\nOlivia responds, rather impassively.\n\n\"Fair enough, so, mind if I sit with you?\"\n\nYou ask, hoping you can maybe find out more about her.

As you approach your seats, you think over what you should talk to her about.\n","page 47":"The rest of the day goes by without much else happening. Neither Allison nor Olivia are in any of your other classes, and you don\u0027t seem to run into either of them. You walk home with Ian, and spend the rest of the day lounging around your home. You\u0027re beginning to feel like you\u0027ve fallen into your old routine from back in the day.\n\nThe next morning, Ian arrives at your door, as per usual, except this time he doesn\u0027t seem to have his backpack.\n\n\"Yo, Jacob.\"\n\nHe says while standing at the end of your walkway.\n\n\"Hey Ian, where\u0027s your backpack?\"\n\nYou ask while walking towards him, a bit confused.\n\n\"Ah, well about that, I was thinking we\u0027d do something a little more interesting than school today.\"\n\nHe replies.\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"Well...you\u0027ll see when we get there.\"\n\nHe says with a bit of a laugh.\n\n\"It\u0027ll be fun man, just hide your bag somewhere first, we won\u0027t need it for where we\u0027re going.\"\n\nHe adds. If you remember right, skipping school so haphazardly wasn\u0027t something Ian often suggested. In fact, if you recall correctly, you were usually the one suggesting it and he was the one rejecting the idea. This makes you really wonder what he has in mind for the day. You stand there and consider if you really want to go or not. After all, if you go you\u0027d be missing school, and you guess that would also mean you miss a chance to see Olivia or Allison.\n\n\"You won\u0027t give any hints about what we\u0027re gonna do?\"\n\nYou ask, hopeful.\n\n\"Not a single one.\"\n\nIan replies smiling.\n","page 49":"At this point you decide you shouldn\u0027t pry into her love life, so you ask her about her past. You pose the question, and she looks at you with a hostile expression that leads you to believe you may be entering a risky topic.\n\n\"My past? Why do you care?\"\n\nShe asks.\n\n\"Just curious is all. I can tell you about my past first if that helps...\"\n\nYou reply defensively. Olivia stares at you angrily, which you take to mean you better start talking.\n\n\"A-alright then. Well, I grew up in this city until I was about...let\u0027s see now, twelve I think. Then my sister got accepted into some fancy private school, and we had to move about an hour away. I still remember that we had to pick up and pack in like a day with no real notice. While in this other city my father...passed away.\"\n\nYou say, remembering him. Your father was by no stretch the greatest father ever, but he was able to pay you attention from time to time and had no large faults, so you have fond memories of him. Olivia\u0027s expression gets a bit softer, probably because she feels bad that she had you bring up a sad topic. You continue on as normal.\n\n\"Then my sister got accepted into another private school, that private high school in this town. So, we moved back here after being gone for six years. Once I came back I met Ian, though I haven\u0027t seen any of my old friends...\"\n\nYou finish, remembering that you did have some friends that you left behind originally, but you never did find them. Come to think of it, with how fast you left you\u0027re not even sure if you had to say goodbye to them to begin with. Olivia looks at you, seeming like she wants to say something.\n\n\"I see...\"\n\nIs all she manages to say thought. You\u0027re not sure why, but it seems like the topic has gotten her a tad depressed. She packs up her lunch and stands.\n\n\"I have to go now...talk to you later.\"\n\nShe says. You give her a wave goodbye, but feel a bit disappointed she didn\u0027t talk about herself at all. You sigh and exit the cafeteria, deciding to try asking her about her past some other time. The rest of the day goes by without much happening, and when you arrive home nothing exciting happens either. The night passes and you lay in your bed, staring at your alarm clock, quite pleased that tomorrow is a Saturday.\n","page 40":"You ponder joining the Wolves with Ian for a minute. This certainly isn\u0027t typical behavior for him after all. After a brief inner argument, you determine that there has to be something more to this gang. Ian wouldn\u0027t throw his life away for no reason, and who knows, maybe him saying it\u0027s a \u0027gang\u0027 is just some self-imposed label. Maybe they act nothing like a gang.\n\n\"Yeah, sure man I\u0027ll join.\"\n\nYou reply. Ian smiles, clearly relieved.\n\n\"Thanks, for a second there I wasn\u0027t sure what you\u0027d do.\"\n\nHe says with a bit of a nervous laugh. For a second there you weren\u0027t really sure what you\u0027d do either. You take a few steps into the room and sit on a comfy looking recliner.\n\n\"So...what now? What exactly does this gang of yours do?\"\n\nYou ask, as Ian places the beer he was previously holding back into the fridge. It seems he didn\u0027t plan on drinking it unless you did as well.\n\n\"Well, calling it a gang may have been a stretch. My brother made it up with his friends a while back, and I joined it pretty recently. So far we basically just all hang out together here every once in a while. A home away from home...kind of.\"\n\nHe says, trailing off a bit at the end.\n\n\"Hmmm. Cool.\"\n\nYou reply. You don\u0027t really want to pry any deeper into his reasons for being here, as you can kind of sense it\u0027s a sensitive topic, and you don\u0027t remember enough about the past, or rather the present, to be confident in your ability to not say something stupid.\n\nThe two of you hang out in the gang\u0027s headquarters for the rest of the day, until about the time when class would normally end. You don\u0027t do a whole lot, just sit around and talk, but it\u0027s kind of nice to just chill with Ian. On your way out, Ian says one more thing.\n\n\"Oh by the way, I can\u0027t make you an official member myself. You\u0027re gonna have to come back when my brother is here to do that.\"\n\n\"Sure, maybe he\u0027ll be here next time.\"\n\nYou reply as you return home. Once there, you find that neither your sister nor mother are aware that you skipped school today. The night passes and you lay in your bed, staring at your alarm clock, quite pleased that tomorrow is a Saturday.\n","page 42":"Remembering your mother\u0027s words, you quickly spring to life early in the morning, and prepare to take your sister to school. Though, all that really involves is you walking a few blocks with her. Although you should have your license at this age (and after a quick check you confirm you do), your mother has the only vehicle, so driving your sister is out of the question. After getting ready you exit your door to find Tina standing there, her fist seemingly prepared to knock. An awkward moment of silence follows as you look at her, contemplating why you two never talk in the future.\n\n\"We...have to go soon.\"\n\nShe manages to say, looking down at the ground to avoid eye contact. Why the hell does it seem like she\u0027s afraid? It annoys you, but you try to ignore it. Your own sister, afraid of you.\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go.\"\n\nYou say, walking past her and towards the door. Come to think of it, you moved around a few times while you were a child, and a good portion of it was due to her. Even though Ian is your best friend, now and in the future, you had only become friends with him a year ago at this point in time. You had lived here before, years ago when you were a child, but you had to moved because of your father\u0027s work. You moved back eventually, but it was only due to Tina getting accepted into the private school she\u0027s currently attending.\n\nFinally ready, the two of you exit the house and begin the walk towards her school. It\u0027s done mainly in silence, and as you get closer to the school, she seems to unconsciously move closer to you, distancing herself again whenever you notice. It always annoyed you how quiet and shy she seemed to be. Once at the school\u0027s large and elegant gates, you stop.\n\n\"There, have fun at school.\"\n\nYou say, as you begin to walk away.\n\n\"U-um...\"\n\nYou hear a small voice say behind you as you go to walk.\n\n\"Can you pick me up after...after school...?\"\n\nYou hear your sister request. Turning to her you sigh.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nYou ask in an obviously annoyed tone. Tina nervously moves back as she clutches her bag.\n\n\"Just because...\"\n","page 41":"You happily decide to sleep in, it\u0027s Saturday after all. You do the same as all teenagers in high school do, sleep as much as possible.\n\nOr rather, you would have spent it sleeping, had you not been rudely awoken at about two by someone knocking on your front door. You groan as you exit your bed and move downstairs to answer the door.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask angrily as you open it, only to find Allison happily standing in front of you. She smiles as you open the door.\n\n\"Why hello there, Jacob, or should I say good morning?\"\n\nShe says cheekily. You open your mouth to retort, but she interrupts you.\n\n\"Anyway, I\u0027ve been out here for a while, so can I come it?\"\n\nShe continues, you go to reply, but she again interrupts you.\n\n\"What do you mean no? Would you really leave a cute girl outside in the cold?\"\n\nYou stand silently and glare at her as she attempts to make a cute pose.\n\n\"...Done?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n","page 101":"If Allison really is willing to answer any question right now, then you should probably ask the question she\u0027s least likely to answer otherwise. With that in mind, you ask her.\n\n\"Why were you upset earlier? You said you had some things going on, so what\u0027s wrong?\"\n\nYou ask in a concerned tone. Allison\u0027s expression changes from her being amused to her be surprised. Apparently she didn\u0027t expect this kind of question. All things considered she\u0027s right, anyone would have expected you to ask her one of the things you\u0027ve been asking her all along. Even so, you\u0027re more concerned about what could be going on with her then those other things. You can probably easily get those answers out of her at the fair. After some silence, she finally responds.\n\n\"I...um...can\u0027t really tell you.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"What? Too bad, you said you would answer the question as truthfully as you could.\"\n\n\"Ah...well...I didn\u0027t expect you to ask that...\"\n\nShe says nervously.\n\n\"Ask a different question.\"\n\nShe requests.\n\n\"Too bad.\"\n\n\"Please?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\nAllison clicks her tongue, disappointed. You originally just asked as a passing thought, but now you\u0027re really curious if she\u0027s so unwilling to tell you. After a few moments of silence, she finally sighs.\n\n\"Alright, I\u0027ll try to explain to you why...\"\n\nShe begins.\n\n\"I\u0027m...jumping through time...\"\n\nShe says. She then smacks herself in the head.\n\n\"Ugh, I didn\u0027t expect you to ask that.\"\n\n\"Wait, what do you mean you\u0027re jumping through time?\"\n\nYou ask in a serious tone. She just said something that would normally be passed off as a joke, but given you have literally gone through time yourself, you\u0027re sure there could be some truth to it. Allison nervously looks around the park, clearly uncomfortable with answering that, but she continues.\n\n\"I...that was a joke! Haha...haha...there\u0027s no way that would be possible right?\"\n\nShe says with faked laughter. You frown and glare at her, indicating you\u0027re not buying it. Suddenly she points behind you.\n\n\"Look out, Jacob!\"\n\nAllison yells, pushing you to the ground. You fall, completely off-balance because of how unexpected it was, and quickly look to where Allison pointed.\n\nAnd see nothing.\n\nYou turn to where she was standing a moment before, in time to see her sprinting out of the park.\n\nDammit!\n\nYou think as you stand up. Rushing to the entrance of the park, you turn in the direction you saw her leave, but can\u0027t see where she went. You kick the ground in futility. She\u0027s jumping through time? What does that even mean? Knowing this, is there some connection between her going through time and you? Unable to follow her, and unable to answer the ever growing questions in your mind, you go back home, and hope you see her again tomorrow.\n","page 222":"\"So, why do you know so much about that bridge?\"\n\nYou ask, concerned. Olivia continues to walk forward without looking at you.\n\n\"It\u0027s nothing, I just have some weird hobbies.\"\n\nShe replies defensively.\n\n\"And what hobby would you consider this one?\"\n\n\"Bridges.\"\n\n\"Your hobby is bridges?\"\n\n\"Yeah, got a problem with that?\"\n\nOlivia snaps. With that, you decide you better stop talking about bridges with her.\n\n\"So, the fair comes here every year right?\"\n\nYou say, figuring that\u0027s a safe topic.\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nOlivia replies, without looking at you.\n\n\"You ever been to it before?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Well, you enjoy it?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"You\u0027re not really interested in talking right now, are you?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"You\u0027re a quick one there, Jacob.\"\n\nShe replies sarcastically.\n\n\"Are you mad at me or something?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s because you don\u0027t know why, that I\u0027m mad at you.\"\n\nShe replies. You stop in your tracks and stare blankly at her. She\u0027s mad at you because you don\u0027t know why she\u0027s mad at you? How can that even make sense? Olivia continues walking ahead, ignoring you, so you quickly catch up to her and match her pace again.\n\n\"That\u0027s....how does that even makes sense?\"\n\nYou ask exasperated. Olivia then stops in front of a house, which is apparently hers. You glance up at it, and find it oddly familiar.\n\n\"Goodnight, Jacob.\"\n\nShe says, walking into house without answering your question. You stand in front of her house in silence, confused and frustrated with her. Olivia can be really unreasonable it seems.\n","page 100":"\"Alright, how do you know me? You act really friendly with me, like we\u0027ve known each other for a long time, but I\u0027ve only known you for less than a week.\"\n\nYou tell her.\n\n\"Hmm...The easiest way to answer that, is to say we used to date.\"\n\nShe responds.\n\n\"We did?\"\n\nYou ask confused. You don\u0027t remember dating her in the past.\n\n\"We certainly did. How do you think I know you so well?\"\n\nShe asks in turn. While she hasn\u0027t mentioned any facts about your past or anything to prove she really knows you, she is pretty good at guessing what you\u0027ll say and do. To this, you shrug, unable to come up with an answer.\n\n\"Thought so. We dated, that\u0027s the answer to your question. The only answer I\u0027ll be giving, I might add.\"\n\nAllison says, attempting to stomp out any additional questions. You don\u0027t want to say she\u0027s wrong, and that you haven\u0027t dated before, but you honestly can\u0027t remember your past well enough to dispute it.\n\n\"Alright, when did we date then?\"\n\nYou ask.\n\n\"Nope, that\u0027s a second question!\"\n\nAllison answers with a smile.\n\n\"No it\u0027s not, it\u0027s part of the first question!\"\n\nYou reply.\n\n\"Nope! It\u0027s a brand new question. That\u0027s it for today Jacob! See you later.\"\n\nAllison says, turning and leaving with a short wave before you get a chance to tell her otherwise. You sigh, but with your question answered, just give in and wave back. You didn\u0027t expect that you had dated her before, but it\u0027s not entirely impossible. It probably would have been at least seven years ago, when you were eleven, since in between then and now you were in a completely different city. Allison must have a pretty good memory to remember you from back then. Done with the park, you return home.\n","page 221":"\"So, why did you bring me to the school?\"\n\nYou ask Olivia, wanting to know. Olivia glances at you, then looks forward again.\n\n\"I just thought...I\u0027m not sure.\"\n\nShe replies uneasily.\n\n\"Olivia...have we met before?\"\n\nYou ask, stopping on the sidewalk. Olivia stops as well and looks back at you. You\u0027ve can\u0027t help but feel you\u0027ve met Olivia before, and that you know her, but when you look back into your memories, you can\u0027t remember anyone that looked like her. She awkwardly shuffles where she stands, before answering you.\n\n\"...No, we haven\u0027t.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"I just wanted to bring you to the school to show you...something...but I decided not to at the last minute. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n\nShe continues. While it\u0027s clear she\u0027s still hiding something from you, the two of you already knowing each other doesn\u0027t seem to be it. You\u0027re curious as to what it is she wanted to show you though, and perhaps more importantly, why she decided not to. Maybe, it has something to do with how she acted when you first arrived there.\n\n\"I see, sorry for asking you a weird question like that then.\"\n\nYou say, starting to walk again.\n\n\"It\u0027s fine, don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n\nShe replies, joining you. After a short walk, Olivia stops in front of a house. You glance up at it, and find it oddly familiar.\n\n\"Goodnight, Jacob.\"\n\nShe says, walking into her house.\n","page 224":"The next day, Wednesday, things go by relatively smoothly. Olivia acts a lot calmer, and the two of you are able to talk during lunch without incident. After school, she informs you that tomorrow she will introduce you to Brent. You wonder why she\u0027d want to introduce the guy that\u0027s going to take her to the fair, to her boyfriend, but agree to it anyway.\n\nThen, Thursday after school, the two of you meet in front of the school, as per what she said the previous day.\n\n\"Alright, we\u0027re gonna go to his house.\"\n\nShe tells you, as she leads the way.\n\n\"You, uh, sure this is a good idea?\"\n\nYou ask skeptically.\n\n\"Of course, you two should get along.\"\n\nShe says in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n\"And you can\u0027t do that unless I introduce you to him.\"\n\nYou can\u0027t disagree with that, but you still don\u0027t think it\u0027s a great idea.\n\n\"Hey...why doesn\u0027t this Brent go to our school?\"\n\nYou ask, curious.\n\n\"Ah, well he did, but he dropped out.\"\n\n\"He dropped out?\"\n\n\"Well...more like he was expelled.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s, um, well just meet him before you judge him.\"\n\nShe says, attempting to save face for him. You\u0027re already getting the idea that he\u0027s not that great a person. And sadly upon reaching his house you find you\u0027re right.\n\nStanding, or rather sitting on his couch, at a good two-hundred and forty pounds, Brent casually glances up at the two of you as you enter his parents house.\n\n\"Hey babe.\"\n\nHe says as she enters the living room, with you behind her.

Why would you bring another guy into my house?\"\n\n\"C-calm down Brent, this is Jacob, he\u0027s just a friend.\"\n\n\"He gay?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nYou reply, before Olivia gets the chance. Brent pulls himself off his couch and walks over to the two of you.\n\n\"Then you ain\u0027t friends, get the fuck out of my house.\"\n\nHe says, glaring at you.\n\n\"Brent! Don\u0027t be like this!\"\n\n\"I SAID GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!\"\n\nHe yells directly in your face, ignoring her completely. He\u0027s a complete dick, is what you determine. You glare back at him, contemplating punching him in the face, but decide not to, instead simply walking out of his house. Olivia seems to panic now, and tries to reason with Brent once you leave the house. At least, that\u0027s what you think, as you can hear their argument from outside the house. You can tell this relationship won\u0027t end well at all. Olivia exits the house after a few minutes.\n\n\"Haha...sorry about that. Brent can get a bit...protective at times.\"\n\nShe says, trying to make light of the situation.\n","page 102":"The next day Allison appears to be missing again. You\u0027re still not sure why she\u0027s keeps disappearing like this, but after yesterday you\u0027re satisfied enough to not look for her. You got her to agree to go to the fair with you, and to answer one of the questions you were dying to ask, so you\u0027ll just be patient and wait for her to return. Although you think that, you\u0027re still hopefully she\u0027ll show up during the day.\n\nHowever she never shows. Classes pass and the school day ends, and Allison is still nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Hey Jacob, something wrong?\"\n\nIan asks as the two of you prepare to leave the school. Ian\u0027s pretty good at reading you, so he probably knows something has been on your mind all day.\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027m really curious as to where Allison is.\"\n\nYou reply absentmindedly.\n\n\"Ah yeah, the new girl who keeps skipping school. You asked her to the fair already right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she said yes.\"\n\n\"Great man, so you ready for the fair?\"\n\n\"What do you mean ready?\"\n\nThe two of you reach the other perimeter of the school and Ian stops.\n\n\"Ready, as in you planned what you\u0027re going to do with her...\"\n\nHe says, as though it\u0027s a really obvious fact you should already be aware of. You had been so focused on getting her there and your other issues, that you had forgotten what you\u0027d actually do.\"\n\n\"Shit....\"\n\nYou say. You then look to Ian.\n\n\"What are you going to do then? You asked Olivia to go right? Did she say yes?\"\n\nYou ask. Ian frowns and sighs.\n\n\"Sort of. I asked her but she\u0027s pretty keen on saying she has a boyfriend. Apparently she\u0027s not even going to go with him anyway.\"\n\nHe complains.

You want to tell her she\u0027s wrong, and that he clearly doesn\u0027t, but you don\u0027t think you\u0027ll get through to her. Instead, you give a sigh of your own.\n\n\"I see, I guess this is it then.\"\n\n\"Yep, sorry Jacob.\"\n\nOlivia replies, brushing away a tear as she begins to cry.\n\n\"I thought it could work...but I guess not.\"\n\nShe continues with a sniffle. You get she\u0027s upset you can\u0027t be friends, but crying for someone you just met seems a bit much. Olivia really isn\u0027t that stable at all.\n\n\"I guess not.\"\n\nYou reply, giving her a short wave and walking away. On your way home, you contemplate if you should try and be friends with Olivia in spite of her boyfriend, but decide she wouldn\u0027t go for that.\n\nFrom that point on, the two of you ignore each other at school. Needless to say, you don\u0027t end up taking her to the fair like you had originally intended. Life passes, and it seems you end up with the exact same future you had the first time around. It looks like you weren\u0027t able to change anything.\n","page 104":"The next day Allison appears to be missing again. You\u0027re still not sure why she\u0027s keeps disappearing like this, but after yesterday you\u0027re satisfied enough to not look for her. You got her to agree to go to the fair with you, and to answer one of the questions you were dying to ask, so you\u0027ll just be patient and wait for her to return. Although you think that, you\u0027re still hopefully she\u0027ll show up during the day.\n\nHowever she never shows. Classes pass and the school day ends, and Allison is still nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Hey Jacob, something wrong?\"\n\nIan asks as the two of you prepare to leave the school. Ian\u0027s pretty good at reading you, so he probably knows something has been on your mind all day.\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027m really curious as to where Allison is.\"\n\nYou reply absentmindedly.\n\n\"Ah yeah, the new girl who keeps skipping school. You asked her to the fair already right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she said yes.\"\n\n\"Great man, so you ready for the fair?\"\n\n\"What do you mean ready?\"\n\nThe two of you reach the other perimeter of the school and Ian stops.\n\n\"Ready, as in you planned what you\u0027re going to do with her...\"\n\nHe says, as though it\u0027s a really obvious fact you should already be aware of. You had been so focused on getting her there and your other issues, that you had forgotten what you\u0027d actually do.\"\n\n\"Shit....\"\n\nYou say. You then look to Ian.\n\n\"What are you going to do then? You asked Olivia to go right? Did she say yes?\"\n\nYou ask. Ian frowns and sighs.\n\n\"Sort of. I asked her but she\u0027s pretty keen on saying she has a boyfriend. Apparently she\u0027s not even going to go with him anyway.\"\n\nHe complains. You nod sympathetically, and your mind wanders to thinking about what you should do with Allison when the fair comes while Ian speaks.\n","page 225":"\"You call that protective?\"\n\nYou reply.\n\n\"He\u0027s clearly a controlling bastard. Why the hell are you with someone like that?\"\n\nAt this, Olivia seems to get offended.\n\n\"He\u0027s nicer than you think. He just has his bad moments!\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"Unlike most people, he actually gives a damn about me. He just has a awkward way of showing it!\"\n\nShe continues, angrily. You briefly consider backing down, but decide it\u0027s too late for that now.\n\n\"Bullshit! He doesn\u0027t care about you at all! I just met the guy and I can see that!\"\n\n\"Exactly! You just met him! You know nothing about him!\"\n\nOlivia says, beginning to yell.\n\n\"And you know nothing about me either!\"\n\nShe adds. You stand there silently as she catches her breath.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, we can\u0027t be friends anymore.\"\n\nShe finally says.\n\n\"What? Why not?\"\n\nYou ask, confused and angry.\n\n\"Because I don\u0027t want to be friends with someone like you! Now get the fuck away!\"\n\nShe screams. At this, Brent leaves his house and stops on his front porch.\n\n\"You heard her. Get the fuck off my property.\"\n\nBrent says, holding a bat in his hands. Olivia looks nervously at the bat then back to you. Realizing it\u0027s a lost cause to try and argue here, you walk away. On the way home, you think about what you should do. Olivia\u0027s emotions seem all over the place, but if she really cares about Brent, you can understand how she could be upset with you. Maybe you should apologize to her about it tomorrow?\n","page 107":"You enter the park and Allison isn\u0027t there. You expected that though, it\u0027d be far too convenient if she were to always be here. Come to think of it, it was pretty naive of you to think she would be here to begin with. However, you\u0027re not satisfied with this. After a quick check around the park, you leave and continue your search for her around the town.\n\nIt\u0027s a futile act, and you laugh at yourself as you search for her. The you that never tried at anything, is now frantically searching for some girl he just met. Your search goes on for hours, before you finally reach the place you were earlier.\n\nThe school.\n\nIt\u0027s around eight at night now, and your eyes have just adjusted to the darkness. The school looks rather intimidating in the dark, but you know no one is inside. While searching, you had an idea of how you could find her. It took you long enough to think of it, but Allison\u0027s address should be in the school\u0027s database. She should be at her house, so in order to find her all you need to do is look that up.\n\nYou circle the building, and unable to find an open window, pick up a nearby rock and throw it through one. Wrapping your shirt around your hand, you clean some of the glass out of the windowsill and hop inside. You used to do this kind of thing all the time when you originally moved away, so you don\u0027t feel too bad about it. Once inside, you wander the halls until you find the main office.\n\nThe doors are locked, but you have enough experience in lock picking to open it without much issue. You\u0027re not really proud of your past that gave you these skills, but they certainly are coming in handy now. You go to a nearby computer and turn it on. Luckily there\u0027s no password or anything needed to log in, and in a few minutes you find what you\u0027re searching for.\n\nBut she\u0027s not there. The school has no record of Allison. With that, you lean back on the chair you were sitting in and sigh. You have no other ideas as to how to find her, so your search for her ends here, with no results to speak of. You wonder why the hell you even bothered to try, when suddenly you hear footsteps down the hall.\n","page 228":"No, there\u0027s no reason for you to apologize when you\u0027re not in the wrong. Olivia is the one being unreasonable here, not you. If anything, it should be her that apologizes to you tomorrow. The next day you decide to tell her this.\n\nWaiting in front of the school, you watch as Olivia walks towards you. She clearly doesn\u0027t want to talk with you, which is understandable, but you feel like you need to tell her this.\n\n\"Hey, Olivia.\"\n\nYou begin. Olivia walks up to you and stops, bringing her eyes to the ground.\n\n\"What do you want, Jacob? I said we can\u0027t be friends anymore...\"\n\nShe asks in a depressed tone. Though if you recall, she said she didn\u0027t want to be friends with you, not that she can\u0027t. You take a deep breath, then speak.\n\n\"Stop being an idiot.\"\n\nYou say calmly. Her attitude immediately shifts to anger.\n\n\"What!?\"\n\n\"Why are you really with Brent?\"\n\n\"I...because we\u0027re in love.\"\n\nShe replies, unsure.\n\n\"You\u0027re obviously not.\"\n\n\"How the fuck would you know?\"\n\nOlivia angrily replies.\n\n\"Stop acting like you know me, and stop pretending...to care.\"\n\nShe continues, pushing past you. You\u0027re not stopping here though. You turn and grab her hand, and she immediately turns around. To your surprise, you can see that she\u0027s started to cry, which causes you to let go of her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe asks, as she makes a futile attempt to wipe her tears away with her sleeve.\n\n\"I...nothing.\"\n\nYou reply, defeated. There\u0027s no way you can yell at a girl who is crying after all. With that, Olivia heads back towards the school without a word. You watch her for a few minutes, unable to come up with a good way to mend this.\n\nThe rest of the day passes with you unable to look at her, let alone talk to her. For some reason seeing her cry, no, being the reason she was crying, has caused you to rethink your friendship with her. Maybe it really is for the better you stop being friends. Maybe it\u0027s just not meant to be. Weeks pass, and as they do it gets harder and harder to talk to Olivia, until eventually you give up on the idea all together. Time goes by, and the future turns out exactly as you remember. It looks like you were unable to change it.\n","page 106":"The next day comes and you haven\u0027t been able to come up with much of a plan for what to do with Allison. From what you can remember about the fair, it was a rather small one, and was mainly comprised of the typical carnival games that no one can ever win. You think there was a Ferris wheel, at least there should be one, and a few other rides. Apart from the Ferris wheel though, there isn\u0027t anything romantic there.\n\nYou shake your head at the thought and bring your attention back to class. The teacher is going on about something to do with your futures, which you quickly lose interest in, causing your attention to drift back to Allison and the fair. You\u0027re still feeling guilty about it all for some odd reason, but you asked her to the fair, which you can assume to implicitly mean she does like you. Well, actually you already know she likes you, you\u0027re just not sure how far you should take that. Your plan had been to take her to all the romantic rides, since you figured that\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to do, but you\u0027re quickly realizing your situation isn\u0027t so typical.\n\nHalfway through the day, Allison finally arrives at the school. You\u0027re relieved to see that she\u0027s fine, but feeling somewhat anxious seeing her again.\n\n\"Hey Jacob! Did I miss anything important?\"\n\nAllison asks as she joins you and Ian in the cafeteria.\n\n\"Nope, nothing at all.\"\n\nYou reply. She smiles and sits beside you, with Ian smirking in a chair across from the two of you.\n\n\"Ah, look at the time. Sorry Jacob, I\u0027ll leave you with the new girl, I gotta go find Olivia.\"\n\nIan announces, standing up. Obviously he intends to have you and Allison spend some time alone, which you internally thank him for.\n\n\"Seeya, new girl.\"\n\nIan says waving to Allison, to which she politely waves back. She then turns and looks at you.\n\n\"So....\"\n\nYou begin awkwardly.\n\n\"Where were you yesterday?\"\n\nYou ask. Allison averts her gaze.\n\n\"No where special. Just didn\u0027t feel like coming to school.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"More importantly, how are things with you?\"\n\nShe asks. You shrug.\n\n\"Fine. You\u0027re ready for the fair this weekend right?\"\n\nYou ask. Allison frowns, apparently unhappy with that reply.\n\n\"Really? Nothing new or unexpected happened to you?\"\n\n\"Not in particular, no.\"\n\nYou reply with a straight face. Apart from the fair and Allison, nothing new or important has been happening to you since you went back in time. Well, apart from you actually going back in time, but you don\u0027t intend on telling her that. You hear Allison mutter something under her breath in an annoyed tone, before she speaks again.\n\n\"I see. That\u0027s a shame, new and exciting things happening is what makes life good.\"\n\nShe says.\n\n\"I suppose. We can count the fair as one of those things though, right?\"\n\nYou reply hopeful. Allison sighs, then smiles.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose we can. I do love those carnival games after all.\"\n\nThe two of you finishing eating and return to class. You continue attempting to plan your day at the fair with Allison throughout the afternoon, and by the end of school you think you have a pretty good idea of what to do.\n","page 227":"Yeah, you need to apologize to her. You don\u0027t agree with her being with Brent at all, but you can see that directly opposing it is not the way for you to help her. Who is to say you even have the right to try and help her anyway? You\u0027ve only known each other for like a week. With that in mind, you decide being humble and apologizing is the way to proceed. If you\u0027re lucky, maybe you can still take her to the fair on Saturday. Even with all of this conflict, you feel like that would be a good thing.\n\nThe next day, you wait in front of the school for Olivia, who upon seeing you, approaches cautiously.\n\n\"Hey, Olivia.\"\n\nYou say, attempting to be friendly.\n\n\"What do you want, Jacob? I said we can\u0027t be friends anymore...\"\n\nShe replies, trying to avoid eye contact. Though if you recall correctly, she said she didn\u0027t want to be friends with you, not that she can\u0027t.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n\nYou say, even unconsciously bowing your head slightly.\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\nOlivia replies, bewildered.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry. I acted like a jerk yesterday.\"\n\nYou continue. Olivia stares at you dumbfounded, before looking away again.\n\n\"So what?\"\n\nShe replies coldly. You\u0027re not really sure how to reply to that. After thinking it through though, you come up with one idea, even if it seems childish.\n\n\"So...can we be friends?\"\n\nYou ask, trying your best not to blush out of embarrassment. Come to think of it, you\u0027re not even sure when you began to care about being her friend this much, or why for that matter. You try and think back to how the past you would have acted, and you\u0027re almost positive he never would have cared. Coming out of your internal thoughts, you see Olivia thinking very carefully over your proposition. It makes you nervous, but it\u0027s better than her laughing or immediately saying no.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nShe finally replies. You smile, relieved, and extend your hand.\n\n\"Good. Friends again?\"\n\nYou ask, confirming. Olivia looks at your hand hesitantly, before extending her own.\n\n\"Yeah...friends...again.\"\n\nShe replies softly, as the two of you shake hands. You wonder if it really makes sense to shake hands with a girl to become friends, but you figure it can\u0027t be too weird. It felt like the right thing to do at the time. The two of you then head inside to your classes, your friendship now mended.\n","page 55":"\"Good, I\u0027m closing the door.\"\n\nYou reply, shutting it immediately in her face. You hear a cry of protest from the other side, and some more banging on the door. Happy with your revenge, you open it again to find her standing there pouting. You smile in response.\n\n\"Done?\"\n\nYou ask. She nods in response.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nYou reply, shutting the door yet again in her face and laughing.\n\n\"Just let me in already, Jacob!\"\n\nYou hear her yell from the other side. You comply and smirk once you see her pouting face again.\n\n\"Well, what you waiting for? Come in!\"\n\nYou say, feigning ignorance and opening the door wider, letting her in. Though it suddenly dawns on you that yourself and a high schooler are about to be alone in your house. You quickly shake off some of the thoughts that come to mind and shut the door once she enters, escorting her into the living room.\n\n\"So, what\u0027d you want?\"\n\nYou ask. She places her hand to her mouth and does an \u0027eh-hem\u0027, before replying.\n\n\"I came to invite you somewhere.\"\n\nAllison replies. You wait for a moment for her to explain further, but get no such response. You\u0027re getting quite a few of these invitations to mysterious places lately.\n\n\"And where would that be?\"\n\n\"Does it matter? You\u0027ll be there with me!\"\n\nShe answers, smiling. For someone you just met the other day, she sure is acting awfully close to you.\n\n\"Alright, when did you want to go then?\"\n\nAllison looks at the nearby clock, seems to nod approvingly, then looks back to you.\n\n\"Right now.\"\n","page 109":"Not wanting to be caught, you throw caution to the wind...and the chair you were sitting on out the window. You\u0027ve dealt with the cops enough to know that if you\u0027re caught now that\u0027ll be the end of your school days. Though, going back in time means you don\u0027t really need school, and come to think of it your job didn\u0027t even need a high school diploma anyway.\n\nYou shake your head and quickly brush the glass away with your shirt, then jump out the window as you hear a yell from down the hall followed by the sound of people running. But they\u0027re too slow. You land on the grass and sprint out of the school grounds, noticing a police car in the parking lot. Sure enough, they\u0027re the ones inside. The school probably has some sort of silent alarm.\n\nYou sprint most of the way home, and by the time you return it\u0027s almost nine at night. Your mother scolds you when you lie and say you were hanging out with Ian. She doesn\u0027t seem convinced, but since you look uninjured lets it go. You sigh a breath of relief, eat, then head up to your room and collapse onto your bed. In the end you wasted hours looking for Allison, ruined a perfectly good shirt, and even broke into the school, with nothing to show for it.\n\nThat being said, for some reason you think it was good that you did it. Even if you didn\u0027t accomplish what you wanted to, you feel relieved knowing that you tried. You had almost forgotten what it was like to actually try.\n","page 54":"Why should you have to pick her up? It\u0027s bad enough you had to walk her here, but Tina is old enough to be walking to and from her own high school.\n\n\"No, you can walk home yourself. Grow up already.\"\n\nYou reply coldly, turning and walking away. Tina doesn\u0027t reply back, and merely walks to the school. She should have expected that answer, given you have no reason to pick her up. Returning to your house, you do what any high schooler does, you spend the day sleeping.\n\nOr rather, you would have spent it sleeping, had you not rudely been awoken at about two by the smashing of fists against your front door. You groan as you exit your bed and move downstairs to answer the door.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask angrily as you open it, only to find Allison happily standing in front of you. She smiles as you open the door.\n\n\"Why hello there, Jacob, or should I say good morning?\"\n\nShe says cheekily. You open your mouth to retort, but she interrupts you.\n\n\"Anyway, I\u0027ve been out here for a while, so can I come it?\"\n\nShe continues, you go to reply, but she again interrupts you.\n\n\"What do you mean no? Would you really leave a cute girl outside in the cold?\"\n\nYou stand silently and glare at her as she attempts to make a cute pose.\n\n\"...Done?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n","page 108":"You quickly shut off the computer and hide underneath the principle\u0027s desk in an attached room. The footsteps get louder and you try to control your breathing.\n\nWhat could her not being in the system mean? You know Allison exists, so did she just not enroll? Maybe she just lied to your teacher and she believe her for whatever reason. Maybe she transferred again already?\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted when you hear the door to the room open wider and someone enter. The school probably has some sort of silent alarm, which called the cops or something. You\u0027ve been inside for about half an hour now, so the person near you is probably a cop.\n\nYour suspicions are confirmed when you see a face peer over the ledge of the desk and a beam of bright light go right into your eyes.\n\n\"Found you!\"\n\nThe cop exclaims, reaching out and grabbing you by the neck. You try to struggle, but with you being temporarily blinded, and him being a lot stronger than you, you stand no chance. Realizing it\u0027s pointless to continue struggling, you give in and comply. Another cop soon enters the room, and the two of you speak to you for a bit.\n\nThe cops brings you back to your house and explains the situation to your mother, who just glares at you in disappointment. You\u0027re expelled from school for breaking an entering. Normally you\u0027d just be given a suspension, but you have quite a bad record, so they bump it out to a full expulsion. You never end up seeing Allison again.\n\nWell, I guess that\u0027s what I get for trying...\n","page 229":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off. You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n“Hey Jake.”\n\n“Hey Ian, ready for another exciting day?” You ask sarcastically.\n\n“Oh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.” He replies with equal sarcasm, “I hope I never quit.”\n\n“Ah yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn’t it?”\n\n“A lifelong-dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to live that dream.”\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there’s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it’s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o’clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.\n","page 57":"\"Fine, come in\", you reply, opening the door further and allowing her to enter.

You pose the question, and she looks at you with a hostile expression that leads you to believe you may be entering a risky topic.\n\n\"My past? Why do you care?\"\n\nShe asks.\n\n\"Just curious is all. I can tell you about my past first if that helps...\"\n\nYou reply defensively. Olivia stares at you angrily, which you take to mean you better start talking.\n\n\"A-alright then. Well, I grew up in this city until I was about...let\u0027s see now, twelve I think. Then my sister got accepted into some fancy private school, and we had to move about an hour away. I still remember that we had to pick up and pack in like a day with no real notice. While in this other city my father...passed away.\"\n\nYou say, remembering him. Your father was by no stretch the greatest father ever, but he was able to pay you attention from time to time and had no large faults, so you have fond memories of him. Olivia\u0027s expression gets a bit softer, probably because she feels bad that she had you bring up a sad topic. You continue on as normal.\n\n\"Then my sister got accepted into another private school, that private high school in this town. So, we moved back here after being gone for six years. Once I came back I met Ian, though I haven\u0027t seen any of my old friends...\"\n\nYou finish, remembering that you did have some friends that you left behind originally, but you never did find them. Come to think of it, with how fast you left you\u0027re not even sure if you had to say goodbye to them to begin with. Olivia looks at you, seeming like she wants to say something.\n\n\"I see...\"\n\nIs all she manages to say thought. You\u0027re not sure why, but it seems like the topic has gotten her a tad depressed. She packs up her lunch and stands.\n\n\"I have to go now...talk to you later.\"\n\nShe says. You give her a wave goodbye, but feel a bit disappointed she didn\u0027t talk about herself at all. You sigh and exit the cafeteria, deciding to try asking her about her past some other time. The rest of the day goes by without much happening, and when you arrive home nothing exciting happens either. The night passes and you lay in your bed, staring at your alarm clock, quite pleased that tomorrow is a Saturday.\n","page 50":"Olivia seems pretty intent on letting everyone know that she has a boyfriend, so maybe that\u0027d be a good place to start. The two of you sit down and take your lunches out.\n\n\"So, tell me about this boyfriend of yours. You must really like him if you keep mentioning him.\"\n\nYou say as you pull out some food. Olivia seems rather surprised that you would ask her such a question, but doesn\u0027t seem reluctant to answer.\n\n\"Why are you interested in Brent?\"\n\nShe asks. You shrug in response. It\u0027s not that you\u0027re interested in him, you just need some sort of starting ground with her.\n\n\"So, I take it Brent is his name then?\"\n\nYou ask, sidestepping her question.\n\n\"Well, it is, but you didn\u0027t answer me.\"\n\nShe replies.

You question if him asking her out is a quality a girl would typically give, but roll with it.\n\n\"So he\u0027s not smart then?\"\n\nYou ask with a laugh.\n\n\"No, though that seems to be a common issue with guys.\"\n\nShe responds with a glare. If you didn\u0027t know better, you\u0027d think she\u0027s implying you\u0027re an idiot.

You don\u0027t really have much else to do later today, so you might as well pick her up, you decide.\n\n\"Fine, I\u0027ll see you after you\u0027re done then.\"\n\nTina, oddly enough, smiles in response. Something you shouldn\u0027t find odd at all, but she never seemed to smile from what you remember.\n\n\"Thanks, see you after I\u0027m done then!\"\n\nShe replies, hurrying into the school. You watch her run away and frown. Why does she want you to pick her up anyway? Sighing again, you turn and leave the school, returning back to your home. It\u0027s only about a 10 minute walk to the school, which calls into question if walking her to and from it really matters, but the distance means you basically have the entire day to yourself. Which you of course, decide to spend sleeping.\n\nOr rather, you would have spent it sleeping, had you not rudely been awoken at about two by the smashing of fists against your front door. You groan as you exit your bed and move downstairs to answer the door.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nYou ask angrily as you open it, only to find Allison happily standing in front of you. She smiles as you open the door.\n\n\"Why hello there, Jacob, or should I say good morning?\"\n\nShe says cheekily. You open your mouth to retort, but she interrupts you.\n\n\"Anyway, I\u0027ve been out here for a while, so can I come in?\"\n\nShe continues, you go to reply, but she again interrupts you.\n\n\"What do you mean no?

You know this place is more than just a hang-out for him, so there\u0027s no way you guys will leave peacefully. Giving a quick glance at Peter, you notice you can see the switchblade in his back pocket.\n\n\"Maggie, watch the door.\"\n\nThe leader says to the girl, who quickly leaves the room.\n\n\"Three-on-three. We win, this place is ours. Fair deal, right?\"\n\nThe leader announces.\n\n\"Fuck off.\"\n\nPeter replies yet again. You can tell he\u0027s currently holding himself back, but won\u0027t be able to for much longer. What can you really do to stop him from stabbing someone though?\n\nYou can\u0027t...\n\nIs what you think to yourself, when a realization comes to you. Maybe you just have to make it so he doesn\u0027t need to use the knife? Maybe if you guys can win without it, nothing bad will happen. Just as you think that, you notice Peter begin to reach into his back pocket. Trusting your instinct, you decide the best course of action is to rush the three yourself, with Peter and Ian having to rush in to help you.\n\nSo, you rush forward and take a swing at the leader, who pulls up his two arms and protects his face.\n\n\"Alright then, we got ourselves a fight!\"\n\nThe leader says, blocking your punch, and swinging back at you. His two buddies rush towards Ian and Peter, giving Peter little time to actually pull out his switchblade, and forcing him to fight with his hands.\n\nGood...\n\nNow you just have to actually win...\n","page 215":"A few hours later, you finally awaken to a splitting headache. You take a moment to regain yourself, and look around at your surroundings. You\u0027re in the \u0027Wolf Den\u0027 still, and by now it seems like the rest of the wolves have arrived. You\u0027re laying on one of the couches, while everyone else converses around you. Noticing you wake up, Ian walks over to you.\n\n\"Hey man, hell of a fight, you uh...gonna be alright there?\"\n\nHe ask cautiously. You can\u0027t see yourself, but for him to word it like that, you must be pretty beat up. Comparatively, Ian and Peter look relatively fine now that you get a good look at them. They certainly look like they\u0027ve been in a fight, but nothing too bad.\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027ll be alright...probably.\"\n\nYou say, sitting up. Peter now notices you\u0027re awake, so he walks over as well.\n\n\"Damn, you must have held back against me, Jacob. You really did a number on that guy haha.\"\n\nHe says with a laugh. He then puts his hand on your shoulder, causing you pain.\n\n\"Ouch.\"\n\n\"Ha, sorry. You\u0027ve got some pretty good timing there too. Running into the room just before they show up.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well. I guess so.\"\n\nYou reply, trying to divert attention away from that.\n\n\"Well, good job man. We appreciate it.\"\n\nHe says, turning serious. Peter then walks away and rejoins the rest of the wolves, leaving just you and Ian. You sigh a breath of relief, realizing that you managed to prevent anything serious from happening. You\u0027re not sure what the future holds, but you\u0027re sure it\u0027s changed for the better now.\n\n\"You\u0027re a good friend, Ian.\"\n\nYou say, thinking about the kind of friend he\u0027s been over the years to you, and how it took you so long to reciprocate that.\n\n\"Naw man, we ain\u0027t friends.\"\n\nIan unexpectedly replies.\n\n\"We\u0027re family.\"\n\nHe says with a smile, looking at you then the rest of the wolves.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess we are.\"\n","page 214":"The fight itself is actually quite gruesome. While one on one you could never beat Peter, that had more to do with your styles of fighting than anything. The leader of this other gang, is poorly matched against you, relying heavily on strength while you rely on speed. This means that every time he goes to punch you, you have just enough time to dodge and then give a counter punch to him.\n\nOf course, he\u0027s not so stupid to let this continue, so once you get in a good few punches, he grabs your shoulder with one hand and holds you in place. Unfortunately, he\u0027s too strong for you to get away from, so after a brief lead, you spend the next few minutes desperately trying to protect yourself from his powerful right punches. You had given him at least a black eye and bloody lip, but a few more minutes in, and you\u0027re looking far worse than he is.\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong kid!\"\n\nHe taunts as he again punches you in the face. You had blocked it, but he\u0027s strong enough that even with a block the force still reaches your head. Your mind is becoming dazed, and you\u0027ve long since lost track of how Ian and Peter are doing. Realizing you can\u0027t continue like this, you scream in frustration, and decide to ignore blocking him, instead throwing fist after fist at his face. Your arms move in a flurry, and with his one arm grabbing you, he can\u0027t hope to block you. He tries to continue to exchange blows with you, but it\u0027s apparent that even with him pounding you in the face, he\u0027s still taking more damage. With that, he lets go of you, and pushes you back, his face dripping in blood. You look up at him from the ground, desperately gasping for air, you own face also dripping in blood.\n\nAt this point you can barely even see him in front of you. All you can feel is pain, and all you can think about is beating the shit out of him, but your body just can\u0027t. You know you can\u0027t win this, what\u0027s worse, is he knows too. Through the blood and sweat you can see him grin down at you. It pisses you off. With another loud scream to motivate yourself, you quickly stand back up, and with what little strength you have left, uppercut him as hard as you can.\n\nBut it\u0027s still not enough, he\u0027s push back into the wall from the force, and you clearly felt something break, but he\u0027s still standing, and still grinning.\n\nFuck...\n\nIs what you think to yourself, as he pulls back his fist and throws an uppercut of his own at you. The punch lifts you off the ground, and you fall back onto the floor. You gasp for breath and watch as he walks towards you, when suddenly a figure flies past you and punches their leader right in his smiling face. This time his smile fades as he\u0027s again knocked into the wall.\n\n\"FUCK OFF ALREADY!!\"\n\nYou hear Peter scream. You can\u0027t tell, but you can only assume this means he and Ian beat their two opponents.\n\nShit...\n\nYou think to yourself, realizing that Peter may still pull out his knife. You try and tell him to stop, but you can barely even breath.\n\n\"WE ARE THE GOD DAMN WOLVES!\"\n\nYou hear Peter yell.\n\n\"THIS IS OUR FUCKING FAMILY!\"\n\nYou hear Ian yell from behind you.\n\n\"AND WE\u0027LL BE DAMNED IF WE LET YOU FUCK WITH IT!\"\n\nThey yell in unison. Their screams seem to echo throughout the building, as the leader of the opposing gang stands by the wall, bracing himself against it. A moment of silence follows, and he coughs up a bit of blood. He glances from Ian to Peter then to you, and finally turns away, leaving the room without saying anything. His gang members follow shortly after, at least you think they do, as moments later, your consciousness leaves you.\n","page 216":"Congratulations!

Allison does a triumphant fist pump to the air and smiles.\n\n\"Great, well then let\u0027s go!\"\n\nShe says, standing up and leaving your house. You follower her obediently for about 10 minutes through the streets of your town before you reach your final destination - a park. She sits on a nearby bench and motions for you to follow.\n\n\"So, what was the point of coming here?\"\n\nYou ask as you sit beside her. Allison gives a soft shrug in response.\n\n\"No real reason.\"\n\nShe answers as she kicks her legs back and forth. You sigh and turn your attention to the park, which while not full of people, still has a few pairs of children and parents playing. Allison makes small talk with you for a bit, about how she used to live in this area, and was fond of this park. You in turn tell her a few random facts about yourself, nothing really interesting. The mood slowly goes from being a light-hearted conversation into awkward silence. Then Allison sighs.\n\n\"I can\u0027t take this anymore...\"\n\nShe says, and then she promptly grabs your shoulders and pushes herself into your chest. You freeze, her sudden show of affection catching you completely off guard.\n\n\"I, um, Allison?\"\n\nYou manage say, incredibly conscious of the fact that her blonde and pink hair is brushing up against your face, and that you can feel her breathing on you.\n\n\"Shut up...you\u0027re so stupid...\"\n\nShe mumbles into you as she clenches your shoulders.\n\n\"Why can\u0027t you figure it out already...\"\n\nYou don\u0027t respond. You can figure by what she\u0027s doing now that she probably has a crush on you. You still have no clue how she knows you, however you can guess that the past you just didn\u0027t notice her. Thinking back, the you of the past was pretty oblivious to the things going on around him. You quietly curse your past self for not noticing this cute girl earlier. Then reality kicks in, and you remember that you\u0027re in a park with other people, being held by a girl a decade younger than you. Your moral center kicks in shortly after, and you force yourself to gentle push her away from you. Even if you\u0027re technically the same age now, something just doesn\u0027t feel right. Surprisingly, Allison doesn\u0027t protest at all.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...\"\n\nYou say, unable to say anything else.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, I understand how you\u0027re feeling.\"\n\nShe says softly with a forced smile.\n\n\"That was pretty rude and selfish of me, sorry...\"\n\nShe continues, standing up.\n\n\"I should have thought about how you felt too.\"\n\nAllison finishes. Before you have a chance to properly respond, she dashes out of the park. You sit there for a few minutes in silence. You hadn\u0027t thought that going back into the past would have revealed something like a past crush that you hadn\u0027t noticed. It depresses you, but eventually you pick yourself up and head home.\n","page 219":"During lunch you meet Ian at your usual table, although he still seems a bit down.\n\n\"Seriously man, what\u0027s wrong?\"\n\nYou ask, taking a seat at the table. Ian gives you a short glare before sighing.\n\n\"It\u0027s nothing, really. You ask Olivia yet?\"\n\n\"Actually, yeah. Surprisingly she said yes.\"\n\nYou say as you begin to eat.\n\n\"That is surprising.\"\n\nIan replies in a disinterested tone. You\u0027re kind of annoyed that he\u0027s so moody today, but you decide not to push it too much. The rest of the day goes by, and after classes are over, Olivia surprises you again by meeting you in front of the school.\n\n\"Hi, Jacob, Ian.\"\n\nShe says, greeting the two of you. The two of you say hi back, so Olivia gets right to her point.\n\n\"Um...Jacob, I want to show you something. Is that okay?\"\n\nShe asks nervously. You kind of surprised by her seemingly sudden change in personality, or at least disposition towards you, but you try and hide that.\n\n\"Well, I don\u0027t mind, but what do you want to show me?\"\n\n\"Just, well, a place.\"\n\n\"A place?\"\n\nOlivia nods. Sensing he\u0027s not really invited, Ian begrudgingly says goodbye and leaves the two of you. You watch him leave, then bring your attention back to Olivia.\n\n\"Why do you want to show me this place?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s....just something I want you to see.\"\n\nShe replies. Not really having anything better to do anyway, you nod and agree to go with her.\n\n\"Alright! This way.\"\n\nShe says excitedly, leading the way. The two of you then head all the way to the other side of town, a good thirty minute walk. Finally, you seem to reach your destination. It\u0027s an elementary school. If you recall correctly, it\u0027s the same one you went to as a child. You turn to Olivia and she eagerly looks at you.\n\n\"So?\"\n\nShe asks, apparently thinking you have something to tell her. You glance at the school and then back to her.\n\n\"It\u0027s a school.\"\n\n\"Do you recognize it?\"\n\n\"Well, it\u0027s the school I went to when I was younger, I think.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And what?\"\n\nOlivia continues to look at you eagerly, before slowly realizing that whatever it is she wanted to hear from you, she isn\u0027t going to hear it. Her mood seems to drop back down, and she seems to become sad.\n\n\"...I see.\"\n\n\"Wait, you brought me all the way here just to show me the school?\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\nYou look at Olivia who hangs her head down, then look back at the school, and try to figure out the point of her bringing you here. You were able to remember this was your school, but beyond that it doesn\u0027t hold any sort of important meaning to you, so you\u0027re at a loss as to what you should say to her. Maybe her bringing you here had something to do with what\u0027s she\u0027s keeping from you?\n\n\"I suppose we should head back then.\"\n\nOlivia says, beginning to walk back in the direction you came.\n","page 65":"\"I\u0027d really prefer not to...\"\n\nYou reply, attempting to dissuade her. In response, she moves towards you until she\u0027s right by your face.\n\n\"Are you really refusing to go out with a cute girl?\"\n\nShe asks accusingly. For a moment she seems to be thinking about something, then she suddenly grabs your hand.\n\n\"Nope, you\u0027re coming!\"\n\nAllison happily declares. You pull your hand away from her, standing your ground.\n\n\"I don\u0027t want to go with you. Who the hell are you anyway?\"\n\nYou ask the girl. For someone who you just met a few days ago, she\u0027s incredibly clingy and demanding of you. Shocked, she backs away from you and sits back in her chair, eyes facing the ground.\n\n\"I...I\u0027m sorry Jacob.\"\n\nShe weakly states.\n\n\"I got a bit ahead of myself it seems. Heh, something must really be wrong with me.\"\n\nShe continues in a dejected tone. You sigh. It seems you got too angry with her and made her upset. Truthfully you find her persistence a little, well more than a little, annoying. You never had that much motivation to do anything growing up, so seeing someone so opposite to you just gets at you a bit.\n\n\"Naw, it\u0027s me that has something wrong with him. Refusing to leave with such a cute girl.\"\n\nYou reply, you face flushing red as you compliment her.\n\n\"But really, I barely know you. Why are you so interested in me?\"\n\nYou ask. You also remember that you never actually told her where you live, but you get the feeling you really don\u0027t want to hear how she knows. Allison takes a deep breath, smacks her cheeks, and looks up to face you.\n\n\"No real reason. You just seemed interesting is all.\"\n\nShe says with an obviously fake smile.\n\n\"Well, if you don\u0027t want to go with me I should probably go.\"\n\nShe says standing up.\n\n\"I\u0027ll see you later Jacob...\"\n\nShe says as she waves to you and exits your house. You want to question her more, but she seems like she\u0027s moments away from emotionally breaking down, so you instead just nod in response as she leaves. You lay down on your couch after she\u0027s gone and stare up at your ceiling.\n\nWho is she...\n\nYou think, before drifting off to sleep for a nap.\n","page 218":"The sound of your alarm clock wakes you and you groggily switch it off. You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n“Hey Jake.”\n\n“Hey Ian, ready for another exciting day?” You ask sarcastically.\n\n“Oh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.” He replies with equal sarcasm, “I hope I never quit.”\n\n“Ah yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn’t it?”\n\n“A lifelong-dream. Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to live that dream.”\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there’s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it’s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o’clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.\n","page 68":"The rest of the day goes by without much else happening. Neither Allison nor Olivia are in any of your other classes, and you don\u0027t seem to run into either of them. You walk home with Ian, and spend the rest of the day lounging around your home. You\u0027re beginning to feel like you\u0027ve fallen into your old routine from back in the day.\n\nThe next morning, Ian arrives at your door, as per usual, except this time he doesn\u0027t seem to have his backpack.\n\n\"Yo, Jacob.\"\n\nHe says while standing at the end of your walkway.\n\n\"Hey Ian, where\u0027s your backpack?\"\n\nYou ask while walking towards him, a bit confused.\n\n\"Ah, well about that, I was thinking we\u0027d do something a little more interesting than school today.\"\n\nHe replies.\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"Well...you\u0027ll see when we get there.\"\n\nHe says with a bit of a laugh.\n\n\"It\u0027ll be fun man, just hide your bag somewhere first, we won\u0027t need it for where we\u0027re going.\"\n\nHe adds. If you remember right, skipping school so haphazardly wasn\u0027t something Ian often suggested. In fact, if you recall correctly, you were usually the one suggesting it and he was the one rejecting the idea. This makes you really wonder what he has in mind for the day. You stand there and consider if you really want to go or not. After all, if you go you\u0027d be missing school, and you guess that would also mean you miss a chance to see Olivia or Allison.\n\n\"You won\u0027t give any hints about what we\u0027re gonna do?\"\n\nYou ask, hopeful.\n\n\"Not a single one.\"\n\nIan replies smiling.\n","page 67":"The rest of the day goes by without much else happening.

Given her personality, you\u0027re rather doubtful she would have accepted no as an actual answer. You lead her into your living room and sit across from her once there.\n\n\"So, what\u0027d you want?\"\n\nYou ask skeptically. Allison\u0027s eyes seem to wander around your living room during this time, but are brought back to you once you ask.\n\n\"I\u0027d like to invite you somewhere...can you come?\"\n\nShe asks. You sit and wait for her to elaborate, but when she remains silent you decide you\u0027ll have to ask yourself.\n\n\"Invite me to where?\"\n\n\"It\u0027s a secret!\"\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t answer my question.\"\n\n\"It wasn\u0027t suppose to!\"\n\n\"You\u0027re not going to answer me properly are you?\"\n\nYou ask.

In response, she moves towards you until she\u0027s right by your face.\n\n\"Are you really refusing to go out with a cute girl?\"\n\nShe asks accusingly.

Allison does a triumphant fist pump to the air and smiles.\n\n\"Great, well then let\u0027s go!\"\n\nShe says, standing up and leaving your house. You follower her obediently for about 10 minutes through the streets of your town before you reach your final destination - a park. She sits on a nearby bench and motions for you to follow.\n\n\"So, what was the point of coming here?\"\n\nYou ask as you sit beside her. Allison gives a soft shrug in response.\n\n\"No real reason.\"\n\nShe answers as she kicks her legs back and forth. You sigh and turn your attention to the park, which while not full of people, still has a few pairs of children and parents playing. Allison makes small talk with you for a bit, about how she used to live in this area, and was fond of this park. You in turn tell her a few random facts about yourself, nothing really interesting. The mood slowly goes from being a light-hearted conversation into awkward silence. Then Allison sighs.\n\n\"I can\u0027t take this anymore...\"\n\nShe says, and then she promptly grabs your shoulders and pushes herself into your chest. You freeze, her sudden show of affection catching you completely off guard.\n\n\"I, um, Allison?\"\n\nYou manage say, incredibly conscious of the fact that her blonde and pink hair is brushing up against your face, and that you can feel her breathing on you.\n\n\"Shut up...you\u0027re so stupid...\"\n\nShe mumbles into you as she clenches your shoulders.\n\n\"Why can\u0027t you figure it out already...\"\n\nYou don\u0027t respond. You can figure by what she\u0027s doing now that she probably has a crush on you. You still have no clue how she knows you, however you can guess that the past you just didn\u0027t notice her. Thinking back, the you of the past was pretty oblivious to the things going on around him. You quietly curse your past self for not noticing this cute girl earlier. Then reality kicks in, and you remember that you\u0027re in a park with other people, being held by a girl a decade younger than you. Your moral center kicks in shortly after, and you force yourself to gentle push her away from you. Even if you\u0027re technically the same age now, something just doesn\u0027t feel right. Surprisingly, Allison doesn\u0027t protest at all.\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry...\"\n\nYou say, unable to say anything else.\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, I understand how you\u0027re feeling.\"\n\nShe says softly with a forced smile.\n\n\"That was pretty rude and selfish of me, sorry...\"\n\nShe continues, standing up.\n\n\"I should have thought about how you felt too.\"\n\nAllison finishes. Before you have a chance to properly respond, she dashes out of the park. You sit there for a few minutes in silence. You hadn\u0027t thought that going back into the past would have revealed something like a past crush that you hadn\u0027t noticed. It depresses you, but eventually you pick yourself up and head home.\n","page 64":"\"I\u0027d love to go Allison, but I gotta pick up my sister from her school soon.\"\n\nYou reply earnestly. Allison seems surprised by the answer, but smiles.\n\n\"I see, when do you have to leave then?\"\n\nYou turn and look at the clock. It currently says it\u0027s about 2:15pm, and your sister\u0027s school ends at 3:00pm, if you\u0027re not mistaken, so you\u0027d have to go in about half an hour, which you imagine is not long enough to leave with Allison.\n\n\"In about half an hour.\"\n\nYou reply. Allison frowns in response.\n\n\"That would have been plenty of time to go with me.\"\n\nShe replies.\n\n\"Oh, I know! I\u0027ll come with you to pick her up!\"\n\nShe says excitedly.

You sigh, unable to give a real reason for her not to, you agree to let her come with you. Until then, the two of you make small talk, although nothing of interest really comes up. You want to ask her more serious questions, like how does she know you, but never find the right moment to bring it up. You leave a little while later, and after a short walk, the two of you reach your sister\u0027s school.\n\n\"So, here we are. Was there really a point in you coming too?\"\n\nYou ask.

You\u0027ve considered asking her if you\u0027ve really never met before, but couldn\u0027t find the right moment. Once in the middle of it, she speaks.\n\n\"Hey Jacob, do you know the height needed to kill yourself from jumping off a bridge?\"\n\n\"No...\"\n\nYou say, completely put off by her comment.\n\n\"Two-hundred fifty feet, from the bridge to the water, results in about a 95% fatality rate.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s...interesting?\"\n\nYou say, almost scared of what she could be thinking.\n\n\"Well, this bridge isn\u0027t that high, but I\u0027m sure it could still be fatal...\"\n\nShe says, looking over the bridge at the water.\n\n\"Why do you know such a morbid fact?\"\n\nYou ask, unsure of what else to say.\n\n\"No real reason.\"\n\nOlivia replies with a shrug. There\u0027s no way there\u0027s no real reason behind this. You figured with her goth outfit Olivia was a bit off, but you didn\u0027t think she was this crazy. You watch her carefully until the two of you are over the bridge, but luckily she doesn\u0027t actually do anything.\n\n\"No one\u0027s ever actually done that here, have they?\"\n\nYou hesitantly ask.\n\n\"There was one person years back. They died, but no one was ever sure if it was an accident or intentional.\n\nShe replies calmly. Once over the bridge, Olivia starts to walk away.\n\n\"Well, I\u0027m gonna go now. See ya, Jacob.\"\n\nShe says, beginning to walk away. There\u0027s no way you can just let her go home by herself after what she just said, so you decide to walk back with her.\n\n\"Alright, I\u0027ll walk you home then.\"\n\nYou say walking up to her. Olivia gives you a quick glance, then continues walking.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nShe says, seemingly disinterested. On the way to her house, you decide to try and strike up a conversation.\n"}
