There\u0027s a long pause, as you just manage to avoid swearing or cussing him out. You wait, choosing your words carefully.\n\n\n\"You have a lot of explaining to do, Joseph.\"\n\n\n\"Explaining?\" Joseph asks with a smile. \"I\u0027m fighting for an Irish republic and full independence. That\u0027s what we both fought for with the IRA, isn\u0027t it? I never left the IRA, and I never stopped fighting. Maybe you need to explain yourself.\"\n\n\n\"I did what was necessary! We got the best we were ever going to get, and you want to throw it away, to gun down your former friends, comrades and family, all for nothing!\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m doing what I can to see the Irish flag fly free!\"\n\n\n\"You might as well piss on the fucking flag, Joseph.\n\n\n\"I wasn\u0027t the one firing artillery down on our heads in the Four Courts!\" Joseph says, growing angrier. \n\n\n\"You were the one who took the Four Courts in the first place!

It\u0027s men\u0027s work!\" \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t talk to me like that!\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"Mary, for god\u0027s sake, this is stuff between men! I\u0027m not trying to belittle you, I\u0027m trying to keep you safe.\"\n\n\n\"Joseph, you need to come home and stop fighting! Killing Irishmen is not the way forward! We will get a full republic, but through the political process!\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s right, Joseph,\" Mary says. \"I\u0027m sick of all of you killing each other and saying it\u0027s just men\u0027s work none of us simple women would understand! It\u0027s not men\u0027s work to widow wives, orphan children, burn towns and slaughter loved ones!\"  \n\n\n\"How the fuck are you going to give out to me for fighting Michael\u0027s British allies!? You, of all fucking people!?\" Joseph snaps. \"That baby sitting right here with us is only here because a fucking British soldier serving the crown got pissed off whiskey and had a fucking go with you!\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re so taken aback you can\u0027t even find the anger within you. Mary pauses, her bottom lip quivering, before her eyes flash with unbridled anger. \n\n\n\"You bastard! You fucking bastard!\" she snarls, standing up. \"How dare you?! How fucking dare you!? You got my husband killed with all of your fucking IRA bullshit antics, and now you\u0027re going to bring that up?!\"\n\n\nMary grabs your pistol from it\u0027s spot at the counter, aiming with both her hands at Joseph\u0027s chest. Joseph raises his hands, backing up to the wall.\n\n\n\"Mary! Put down the gun, goddammit!\" you say. \n\n\n\"Get the fuck out of here, Joseph! OUT!\" Mary shouts.\n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t come here...!\" Joseph says, before Mary interrupts him by pulling back the hammer loudly. \n\n\n\"Get the fuck out of here, Joseph. Nothing good\u0027s going to come from you staying,\" she says darkly. \n\n\nJoseph goes to protest, before nodding weakly. You watch as he makes his way out of the house. You let out a quiet sigh of relief that he\u0027s left, before turning to Mary, whose darkened face is staring at Joseph walks down the driveway. As soon as he\u0027s out of sight, Mary drops to the ground, the gun skidding along the ground. You grab Mary, embracing her tightly, as she bursts into crying, quickly followed by Morgan.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Michael, I just got so caught up in it, and he mentioned Morgan...\" she sobs.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m alright. Nothing to be sorry for,\" you say. \"Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s OK. Come on, let\u0027s go get a drink.\"\n\n\nLittle else is said in the night, as you drink away your sorrows. When Ma gets back, not a word is said to her. It\u0027s best not to upset her with these things. Instead, you all just head to bed, not wanting to talk about the day\u0027s events.\n",

You spend quite a bit of time out on patrol, making sure the IRA are pacified. Out in the field, you have a chance to fight, to protect your country, to do something for the nation that actually matters to you. There, in the fields, you can work for hours on end, focusing on nothing but work. You don\u0027t have to picture children burning alive in fires just out of your view. No, you don\u0027t have to deal with that until night falls. \n\n\nBy April 1923, the fight for independence has worsened considerably for your side. More and more IRA soldiers are captured, with over 12,000 imprisoned at this point in the war. Ernie O\u0027Malley, the man who trained the old IRA unit in the fight against the British, is shot twenty times, before being captured. Impressively, he manages to survive. The IRA forces are desperate for a ceasefire, hoping they\u0027ll simply survive as it becomes clear there\u0027s little chance of success. Frank Aiken is elected to the Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, becoming the anti-Treaty commander. \n\n\nWith Aiken being put in charge, a new offensive is being organized by the National Army. You\u0027re heading down to Cork, for an organized sweep of rebel-held areas, arms stockpiles, outposts and anything else. If Cork, the rebel county that once literally burned with passionate rebelliousness, falls, then the anti-Treaty forces won\u0027t have control of any territory, and they\u0027ll be crushed. With their fall, the anti-Treaty forces will be left broken and disbanded, giving them almost now power.\n\n\nYou find yourself deep in Cork, out in the countryside, moving on the old town of Bandon, one of the last bastions of the anti-Treaty forces. You move along the road with your squad of a dozen Free State soldiers, moving towards the center of the town. Although they\u0027re heavily outnumbered and outgunned, with none of the powerful weaponry you thought that your forces have, the anti-Treaty forces are trying to defend their town through hidden riflemen and moving squads of ambushers ready to hit your flanks and retreat off into the distance. You\u0027ve been left as the second of command of the group, with Fionn in charge. Your mission is simple: clear the enemies and take back Bandon.\n\n\nYou walk along the road, at the head of your column of men. You stroll along the road, moving toward the town. You hold up a hand, stopping the column. Ahead, down the road, is a hastily constructed barricade, simply a toppled tree trunk blocking off the road with a few smaller logs stacked against it. A cursory glance shows you that the barricade is unmanned, although you can\u0027t tell for sure. It blocks the only main path forward through the woods, although you\u0027re sure there\u0027s other paths forward.\n\n\n\"Barricade,\" you say to Fionn. \"Could be abandoned. Could be an ambush.\"\n\n\n\"Any suggestions?\" Fionn asks, rubbing his rifle barrel nervously.\n",

You raise your rifle, firing after one of them as he slips off behind a building, before seeing another moving towards the stables, planning to steal a horse. You rush towards the stables, hurrying to catch up with the larger silhouette. You race after him, reaching him just as he nearly manages to clamber onto a horse. You raise your rifle, pointing it at the back of his head. \n\n\n\"Hold! Hold, or I\u0027ll shoot you!\"\n\n\nThe figure stops, before slowly raising his hands, He turns to face you, as you stare at Joseph, who looks darkly at you. \n\n\n\"Hey, Michael,\" he says darkly. \n\n\n\"Joseph!\" you say, taken aback. \"Jesus, Joseph.

I\u0027d say my time has come.\"\n\n\n\"Then drop your weapons, and this can be over!\" you shout.\n\n\nJoseph slowly unbuttons his holster, placing his hand on the revolver handle.\n\n\n\"Drop the gun, Joseph!\" you snarl.\n\n\n\"No, I don\u0027t think I can, Michael. I\u0027m tired of fighting, but I won\u0027t abandon my cause. I\u0027ll go out like a soldier. Now, I\u0027m going to draw my pistol, and I\u0027m going to start shooting for as long as I last.

You boot it open with a heavy kick, rushing over to take cover behind a gravestone as rifle fire bursts out from the town hall, nearly killing you.

After them!\" Fionn yells.\n\n\nYou quickly burst out of the town hall, rushing after the escaping soldiers. You raise your rifle, firing after one of them as he slips off behind a building, before seeing another moving towards the stables, planning to steal a horse. You rush towards the stables, hurrying to catch up with the larger silhouette. You race after him, reaching him just as he nearly manages to clamber onto a horse.

You raise your rifle, smashing open one of the stained glass windows, knocking the glass out with the butt of your rifle, quickly clearing a path to get through. A soldier offers you a knee, and you clamber into the church, toppling inside the building as you land on the floor with a thud. Your unit quickly enters the church, as you head to the other side to get out of there.\n\n\n\"Something feels wrong about sneaking through a church,\" Fionn says.\n\n\n\"All of this is wrong.

  "page 710": "The next few months are a dark, miserable time. Ever since Joseph coming over, incident, you\u0027ve noticeably darker. You spend quite a bit of time out on patrol, making sure the IRA are pacified. Out in the field, you have a chance to fight, to protect your country, to do something for the nation that actually matters to you. There, in the fields, you can work for hours on end, focusing on nothing but work. You don\u0027t have to picture children burning alive in fires just out of your view. No, you don\u0027t have to deal with that until night falls. \n\n\nBy April 1923, the fight for independence has worsened considerably for your side. More and more IRA soldiers are captured, with over 12,000 imprisoned at this point in the war. Ernie O\u0027Malley, the man who trained the old IRA unit in the fight against the British, is shot twenty times, before being captured. Impressively, he manages to survive. The IRA forces are desperate for a ceasefire, hoping they\u0027ll simply survive as it becomes clear there\u0027s little chance of success. Frank Aiken is elected to the Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, becoming the anti-Treaty commander. \n\n\nWith Aiken being put in charge, a new offensive is being organized by the National Army. You\u0027re heading down to Cork, for an organized sweep of rebel-held areas, arms stockpiles, outposts and anything else. If Cork, the rebel county that once literally burned with passionate rebelliousness, falls, then the anti-Treaty forces won\u0027t have control of any territory, and they\u0027ll be crushed. With their fall, the anti-Treaty forces will be left broken and disbanded, giving them almost now power.\n\n\nYou find yourself deep in Cork, out in the countryside, moving on the old town of Bandon, one of the last bastions of the anti-Treaty forces. You move along the road with your squad of a dozen Free State soldiers, moving towards the center of the town. Although they\u0027re heavily outnumbered and outgunned, with none of the powerful weaponry you thought that your forces have, the anti-Treaty forces are trying to defend their town through hidden riflemen and moving squads of ambushers ready to hit your flanks and retreat off into the distance. You\u0027ve been left as the second of command of the group, with Fionn in charge. Your mission is simple: clear the enemies and take back Bandon.\n\n\nYou walk along the road, at the head of your column of men. You stroll along the road, moving toward the town. You hold up a hand, stopping the column. Ahead, down the road, is a hastily constructed barricade, simply a toppled tree trunk blocking off the road with a few smaller logs stacked against it. A cursory glance shows you that the barricade is unmanned, although you can\u0027t tell for sure. It blocks the only main path forward through the woods, although you\u0027re sure there\u0027s other paths forward.\n\n\n\"Barricade,\" you say to Fionn. \"Could be abandoned. Could be an ambush.\"\n\n\n\"Any suggestions?\" Fionn asks, rubbing his rifle barrel nervously.\n",
  "page 712": "\"Let\u0027s tear the barricade down,\" you say. \"That\u0027ll give us the mobility to move into the town and finish them off.\"\n\n\nYou walk forward, moving up to the barricade. A few of the soldiers begin pulling down the logs, tossing them aside and off into the woods as you move to the tree trunk, lifting it up with a mighty pull as the others help, and you begin to lift the tree trunk free.\n\n\nA bullet thuds into the tree trunk, as the shot rings out across the woods, as a smattering of gunfire bursts out. The tree trunk drops to the ground with  a heavy thud as two men fall to the ground, bullets blowing through their chests.\n\n\n\"Shit, snipers!\" you yell out.\n\n\nThe next bullet bounces off the wooden barricade with a spray of splinters, as you dive for cover. You clamber behind the trunk, as another shot slams into your back, knocking you to the ground. You\u0027re knocked onto the trunk, as you cling to it with a desperate gasp as blood runs down your back. You try to stand, before the next shot hits your shoulder, sending you collapsing off the trunk and onto the ground, as blood begins soaking through your uniform.\n\n\nOne of your allies rushes over to you, grabbing your arm to attempt to drag you to cover, although the world quickly grows dark, as you vision blurs. Soon, the last of your blood seeps out onto the ground, and you\u0027re left cold and limp.\n",
  "page 711": "Over the next few weeks, the anti-Treaty forces begin regrouping and making plans, as hostilities rise. They attempt to recruit and find arms, but there\u0027s little actual engagements. The fighting is kept to small-time raids and ambushes. It\u0027s clear that no one really wants to kill their fellow countrymen, their comrades, their friends, their family. \n\n\nEventually, after several tours defending the area from potential IRA ambushers and attacks, you return home, where you meet with your family, including the newest addition to the family, Morgan, Mary and Arthur\u0027s child. Well, not exactly Mary and Arthur\u0027s, but... still. \n\n\nIt\u0027s good to return home to be with your family, and you\u0027ve a few weeks leave, so you might finally get a break from the constant cycle of violence and bloodshed and killing.\n",
  "page 714": "\"Let\u0027s move through the trees to avoid this obstacle,\" you advise.\n\n\nFionn agrees, as you quickly break into the trees, heading into the woods. You begin marching through th trees, stomping through the mud and muck of the place as you hurry to get to Bandon. However, amongst the trees, you become dispersed, not marching in tight formation due to the terrain, instead splitting apart as you break away into several units. \n\n\nYou walk along through the woods, before pausing as you stumble across a plainclothes man hiding behind a tree, trying to stay in cover, a rifle in hand. You pause, your eyes widening as he stares at you for a brief moment.\n\n\n\"Men! We\u0027ve an IRA soldier sneaking...!\" you begin to yell, turning back to your own men as you frantically raise your rifle. \n\n\n\"Shut the fuck up!\" he says, slamming the butt of his rifle into your head with a frantic smack. \n\n\nYou hit the ground, your rifle skidding along the dirt. You frantically reach out for it, muck and dirt covering your face. A boot slams into your back, stomping onto your side as you let out a pained groan. A rifle jams into your back, as a bullet slams through your chest, blowing out your lungs. The next shot pierces your side, before a third shot blows out your heart, killing you instantly.\n",
  "page 713": "\"Push forward and secure the area,\" you order, as your squad moves forward, quickly taking the area around the barricade and setting up a secure defensive position.\n\n\n\"God job, men,\" you say. \"Murphy, O\u0027Flynn, get to work tearing down the barri...!\"\n\n\nA bullet dashes off the ground to your right, as an unknown number of gunmen open fire from the words. You dive for cover, as quickly your men let out a burst of gunfire. From their defensive position, you quickly push back the enemy without a loss, as the anti-Treaty gunmen quickly hurry to retreat off into the woods. You pause, wondering to pursue them.\n",
  "page 716": "\"Follow them!\" you order loudly. \"Don\u0027t let them escape, dammit!\"\n\n\nYou quickly lead the men the men into the woods, rushing after the gunmen as you lead your forces charging out through the woods, hurrying out through the trees. You rush after the gunmen, heading through the thick undergrowth as you hurry through the trees as you leave the road long behind you.\n\n\nSuddenly, a hail of bullets fires out from the bushes, as you realize you\u0027ve been led into an ambush. Gunfire bursts out from the hidden positions, as you frantically attempt to stop your forces from being routed. A bullet slams into your neck, sending you toppling to the floor. You smack into the ground with a thud, before another bullet blows out your skull, sending a mixture of brain matter and skull chunks out onto the ground. \n",
  "page 717": "You hold your position, as the gunmen retreat, leaving you alone to deal with the current issue at hand. With your opponents gone, you quickly cease control of the road and tear down the barricade, pulling the log down and moving it aside, clearing your path up for the approach to continue.\n\n\nWith the barricade taken down, you quickly return to work, moving down the path as you soon reach the town of Bandon. The medium-sized town is in chaos, as several other groups of Free State soldiers attack the last core of anti-Treaty soldiers in the town, and perhaps even the entire county. \n\n\nThe anti-Treaty forces have secured the town hall, guarding it as they\u0027re advanced upon by the far larger and far better armed and supplied National Army. You stare ahead, realizing you\u0027ve a straight shot up to the town hall to bust in and bring this to a close. You can push on in a straight charge, the quickest, most direct route to the enemy, although it fully exposes you to their rifle fire. You can flank through them through the church, using that to ambush and attack them in a flanking maneuver to avoid their fire, although using a church for war seems very dishonorable way to win. You could also use the cover of the local graveyard to move up to capture the town hall, although that also could be quite an immoral way to deal with the enemy.\n",
  "page 620": "\"Fionn, we outnumber you, you\u0027re not going to survive!\"\n\n\n\"I said surrender, dammit!\" Fionn says, raising his rifle to aim at your head.\n\n\n\"Fionn, we fought a fucking war together!\"\n\n\n\"Michael, lower your weapon!\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re not going to shoot me!\"\n\n\nFionn fires his rifle, as a bullet explodes through your chest. The bullet splatters through your chest, as you\u0027re left standing there, feeling like you\u0027ve been punched in the chest, blood seeping through your shirt.\n\n\n\"Huh,\" you say\n\n\nFionn lowers his rifle as he realizes what he\u0027s just down, as Joseph raises his rifle, firing and killing him instantly. As you collapse onto the ground, blood pouring out your chest as Joseph guns down the other three men who stand there, stunned and shocked. Immediately after, Joseph drops his rifle, moving down to help you, but his voice is already faint and far in the distance, his face dark and blurry. Soon, you\u0027re falling backwards into sleep, and you\u0027re left with nothing.\n",
  "page 501": "You walk with Joseph down the dark streets towards the small bar known as the Boar\u0027s Head. You\u0027ve already searched several other bars for the man known as Carter, as well as all the local Black and Tan spots. The staunchly unionist Boar\u0027s Head Pub is one of the last places you\u0027ve left to check, but one of the most promising. A heavy revolver sits tucked away in your pocket, as Joseph pushes open the door and you follow Joseph inside.\n\n\nThe interior of a pub is a well lit, relatively empty place. Apart from a few old patrons, the main customers of the place are a group of uniformed Black and Tans who sit around a table.\n\n\n\"That\u0027s gotta be them?\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s do this,\" you say, walking forward.\n\n\nYou walk up to the group of men, leaning down over them as their laughter and conversation grows soft.\n\n\n\"Hello there, lads. I\u0027m looking for Carter?\"\n\n\nA young, blond-haired man with blue eyes looks up at you. \n\n\n\"Yes?\" he asks.\n",

We surrender!\"\n\n\n\"What?\" one of the IRA soldiers asks, taken aback.\n\n\n\"We can\u0027t fucking surrender!\" Joseph shouts angrily, his gun raised.\n\n\n\"Look, just...! Everybody, lower your rifles so n...!\" you try to formulate words, before the second push of IRA soldiers flood in, and it all goes to hell in a hand basket.\n\n\nThe next wave of IRA soldiers surges into the room behind you, and they\u0027re far more eager to break into fighting rather then trying to negotiate. Of course, this leads to the Free State soldiers raising their rifle as they fire back, and you\u0027re left stuck in the crossfire. Bullets hammer through you, back and front, as frantic, panicky riflemen fire into the confusing mess in front of them, unsure of what\u0027s going on. A bullet quickly finds its way to your skull, busting it open like a nut and sending your brains splattering out onto the floor.\n",
  "page 500": "With that, you begin the long journey home. It takes some time, and as you arrive, the sun is just disappearing over the hill, vanishing from your site. You push open the door to the same house, walking inside. Joseph and Ma sit at the kitchen table. Joseph\u0027s reading a book, while Ma stares, worried looking into the candle that sits in the middle of the table. You sit down next to her, sighing.\n\n\n\"I couldn\u0027t get anything for you,\" you say. \"The Black and Tans attacked, wrecking everything I bought. A huge waste of money even going out in the first place, really.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s OK, it doesn\u0027t matter,\" Ma says, absent-mindedly, her gaze not shifting from the flame.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Mary\u0027s gone missing,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Mary is an hour late to get home,\" Joseph says. \"She\u0027s not gone missing.\"\n\n\n\"Mary is never home late,\" Ma says. \"Never.\"\n\n\n\"She\u0027s probably out with Arthur,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Arthur\u0027s a good boy, he never ends of being late,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Never thought I\u0027d here you say that about a Unionist,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"We need to go out and look for her,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s fine,\" you say. \"She\u0027s a grown woman. She\u0027ll be home soon.\"\n\n\nYou quickly begin preparing dinner, getting the stove going and boiling the potatoes and getting everything ready. You make sure you\u0027re cooking up enough for Mary as well, because like Ma says, it\u0027s strange she\u0027s late. She\u0027ll definitely be home for dinner.\n\n\nYou\u0027re halfway through finishing dinner when the door to the farmhouse opens, as Mary arrives home.\n\n\n\"Thank Christ,\" you mutter under your breath, walking out to the entrance to the home.\n\n\nMary stands there, in the worst state you\u0027ve ever seen her in. Her hair is slick with blood, sticking to the side of her face as it smears it red. Her face is heavily bruised from what must\u0027ve been one serious beating. Her dress is nearly torn off her, with several tears along the skirt. Tears run down her discolored cheeks, as her lip quivers from the trauma of her night. A long cut runs across her forehead, disappearing to her hairline, with a trickle of blood running down her face and soaking her hair and scap with the dark blood. Her inner thighs and legs are slick with blood and... you grimace, as Mary stares at you with a distant, deadened look.\n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you say. \"Ma! Joseph! Get down here!\"\n\n\nYou rush over to her, wrapping her up as she presses her face into the the nook of your neck and shoulder. Ma and Joseph arrive on scene. Ma lets out a horrified shriek, running over to her daughter and giving her a tight hug as you step back.\n\n\n\"Oh my dear God, sweet God above, what\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened you?\" \n\n\n\"I... I was walking home, and he attacked me,\" she says in between sobs. \n\n\n\"Who?

You pause, staring blankly at Joseph, who is absolutely fuming with rage.\n\n\n\"That fucking bastard raped her,\" Joseph says. \"We\u0027ve been putting up with far too much, far too much bullshit because of cockroaches like these. We need to deal with him. This can\u0027t be left stand.\"\n\n\n\"What do you want us to do?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"We go group up my IRA unit. They\u0027re all good, brave men who\u0027d die for me, and sure as hell would kill for me and justify this. You\u0027d recognize a few of them from the rising. We organize an ambush. Blow Carter\u0027s head off with a fucking rifle and deal with this shit.\"\n\n\n\"We shouldn\u0027t involve them. This is our duty to deal with, not yours. We need to fucking do something about this ourselves, not just gather up your men for another ambush,\" you say. \"We deal with this personally.\"\n",
  "page 503": "You sit around the kitchen of a farmhouse, waiting patiently for the other Volunteers to arrive for training. You sit next to Fionn, a young man who is an adamant supporter of the cause who even at his young age is willing to spill blood, your brother Joseph, and an older man by the name of John who is remarkably quiet.\n\n\n\"Sean Treacy always was a remarkably aggressive man. I\u0027m not surprised at this,\" Fionn says.\n\n\n\"You don\u0027t support his actions?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Of course I do. They\u0027re for the best. It was only a matter of times before Britain attacks. So, probably the best we made the first move.\"\n\n\n\"Now, we can\u0027t submit to the British anymore,\" Joseph says. \"Today, we\u0027re forced to live or die, fight or break. It\u0027s freedom or death, now.\"\n\n\n\"Sean Treacy and his group did their crimes without the approval of the Dáil. That wasn\u0027t an act of soldiers, it was an act of terrorism. They didn\u0027t fight for any nation, they fought to force us to act,\" Sean says, breaking his silence.\n\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Fionn says. \"But perhaps it was necessary.\"\n\n\nThe door to the house opens, as a man strolls in, a pipe clenched between his teeth. He looks to Fionn, smiling.\n\n\n\"McGregor, I presume?\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s right. I can\u0027t say we\u0027ve met before. You are?\" Fionn asks.\n\n\n\"Ernie O\u0027Malley,\" the man smiles. \"I\u0027m in charge of organizing the IRA rural branches. I was told your branch was meeting here.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re the college student who took pot shots at the British from UCD, didn\u0027t you?\" Joseph asks, as Ernie O\u0027Malley grins, embarrassed.\n\n\n\"Aye, that was me. I admittedly wasn\u0027t a big nationalist back then, but that tendency has grown, clearly,\" he nods. \"Anyway, I hitched a ride here with a cart and carriage carrying a few men. How many are you expecting?\"\n\n\n\"Nineteen men, myself included,\" Fionn says.\n\n\n\"Perfect. More than enough men to do what needs to be done. Now, it\u0027s best to keep drilling to night, and as quietly as can be, but this\u0027ll do for now. I\u0027m in a bit of a hurry. Shall we begin?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, we shall,\" Fionn says, as you all head outside.\n\n\n\"Sorry, I didn\u0027t catch your names,\" Ernie says, turning to you.\n\n\n\"Sean Craig.\"\n\n\n\"Craig? Hardly a Catholic surname. Are you a Protestant?\"\n\n\n\"That a problem?\" Sean asks.\n\n\n\"Of course not. Wolfe Tone was a proper Irish patriot, and he was Protestant. There\u0027s rumors that the IRA are a Catholic supremacy organization, but that\u0027s a load of drivel. We want equal rights for Catholics and Protestants. We want nothing more ,and we\u0027ll take nothing else.\"\n\n\nErnie O\u0027Malley turns to you two again, nodding.\n\n\n\"And you two?\"\n\n\n\"Joseph McCarthy. This is my brother, Michael.\"\n\n\n\"A pleasure to meet you two.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re led outside, where about a dozen other men have assembled. A few hold rifles, taken from Fionn\u0027s shed. Ernie strolls over, grabbing a rifle from a recruit. He shoulders it, checking to make sure it\u0027s loaded, before staring down the iron sights. \n\n\n\"This\u0027ll work,\" he nods, before looking around. \"Any targets?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve a scarecrow that I\u0027ve used before,\" Fionn says, as you spot the old scarecrow down the field, among the cold, winter-stricken fields.\n\n\n\"The scarecrow, then. A shame we don\u0027t have a British uniform to stuff it in. Anyone care to be the example?\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re shoved forward by Joseph, as Ernie grins, handing you the rifle.\n\n\n\"All yours, Michael. Do your best.\"\n\n\nYou grab the rifle, aiming down it the iron sights as you stare at the scarecrow. It\u0027s very, very far away, and you highly doubt you have a chance to actually hit it.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re trying to ambush this British soldier, before he gets to your house, shits in your bed, pisses in your tea and eats your dinner. Take your time, he hasn\u0027t seen you yet. Go.\"\n",

Joseph, do you stand by your brother\u0027s opinion?\"\n\n\nJoseph nods.\n\n\n\"Well then, we\u0027re decided. We attack. Assemble the troops.\"\n\n\nYou quickly assemble the troops, preparing them for an assault. The rescued prisoners are organized into groups and armed, as you hurry to move your forces out there to eliminate the Free State soldiers before this battle can even begin.\n\n\nYou find the Free State soldiers on the outskirts of the town, the Free State soldiers attempt to organize, setting up their long-range field guns to provide some artillery in the assault on the town, while setting up ammo reserves and first aid centers to take the wounded to. They\u0027re in no way ready for your quick, fast-paced attack and you fall upon them with gusto.\n\n\nHowever, the battle quickly turns to chaos. Without an organized plan, and the lack of fluidity in action that comes from trying to bring men from across the country into an army in such a small period of time, your IRA forces quickly break up and fall into chaos. The Free State soldiers, taken by surprise and still somewhat disorganized, are left in a desperate panic as well. This isn\u0027t helped by the fact many of you know men on the other side, leading to an unwillingness to partake in the brutality necessary to swiftly win a battle.\n\n\nThe battle becomes a bizarre combat, as soldiers break lines and break into melees, while others retreat, try to surrender, or do anything they can in this awful attempt at combat. The battle swiftly turns to hell, as you\u0027re left desperately trying to organize something, anything, out of the miserable chaos of the battle.\n\n\nIn the general chaos are both forces try to organize, a Free State rifleman manages to get a clear shot at one of the IRA leaders desperately trying to organize their men. He raises his rifle, staring down the iron sights as he lets out a quiet prayer for the soul he\u0027s about to send to God, before finally pulling the trigger. \n\n\nThe shot bursts straight through your chest, as you stumble forward for a meek few steps. You let out a pained gasp for air, before your strength is sapped and your legs give way, and you collapse to the ground, death quickly taking you.\n",
  "page 502": "Later that day, where Dáil Éireann declares an Irish republic, similar to the Proclamation of Irish independence during the 1916 Easter Rising. Of course, that\u0027s not the main event of the day. In an event inspired by the declaration, a group of nine Irish volunteers, in an unauthorized action, organized an ambush at Soloheadbeg.\n\n\nIn hopes of provoking off a brutal conflict, the group ambush a convoy of two council officers and two RIC officers with the hopes of taking the guns and gelignite, an explosive. After calling on them to surrender, the RIC officers opened fire. They were gunned down, and the two council officers captured so the explosives and weapons could be taken. The group fled, releasing the hostages and escaping off into the farmlands.\n\n\nHowever, it\u0027s clear that this isn\u0027t the end of the story. The actions of the volunteers provokes a brutal response. This action is such a serious event that it\u0027s clear the situation in Ireland has changed. It is the start of the Irish War of Independence, as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) is forced to defend the existence of the newfound Irish republic, and the Royal Irish constabulary and British army desperately attempt to defend their right.\n\n\nThe Irish War of Independence has began.\n",

You\u0027ve done endless hours of rifle training and drilling, this shouldn\u0027t be that hard, but that scarecrow is incredibly far away.\n\n\nYou could drop to a knee, taking the classic kneeling position. It\u0027ll give you a better chance at at shot then just raising your rifle or firing, or you could go prone, lying flat on the ground, which might work just as well. It\u0027s hard to tell which would work.\n",

Joseph, do you stand by your brother\u0027s opinion?\"\n\n\nJoseph nods.\n\n\n\"Well then, we\u0027re decided. We try organize the troops. Meanwhile, prepare for a defense in case they refuse our terms.\"\n\n\nYou quickly assemble the troops, preparing them for a defense, while Frank Aiken sends out an unarmed messenger to offer terms to the Free State. The terms are simple: the IRA forces be allowed to retreat with the prisoners captured and the arms taken, in exchange for allowing the Free State to retake the town, as well as releasing the Free State prisoners that have been captured in the taking of the town. There\u0027s a long, desperate and nerve-wracking wait, as you prepare for the Free State\u0027s response. \n\n\nAfter about an hour of waiting, the messenger finally returns. Frank Aiken, you, Joseph and Aiken\u0027s other lieutenants assemble around him.\n\n\n\"What did he say?\" Frank Aiken asks.\n\n\n\"They said if they have your word that their men will be released, and that there will be no attempt at sabotaging the town or leaving behind traps for the Free State soldiers who take back the town, then it\u0027s agreed, and you can begin evacuating the town.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" Frank Aiken says, a relieved smile flashing across his face. \"Let\u0027s begin the evacuation as soon as we can.\"\n\n\nYou begin to organize the transport of the captured arms out of the barracks in a few trucks captured out back, as you organize the released Republican soldiers. You leave the captured Free State soldiers in the cells they once imprisoned your comrades. With that, you begin a slow, nervous evacuation of the town, retreating to the countryside where you can disperse and escape with your captured spoils. As you sit in the passenger seat of a truck laden with captured rifles, you nervously wait, terrified of the Free State going against their word and attacking, which with the element of surprise and the use of artillery, they could easily wipe you out. Thankfully, though they make no such attempt, and you quickly escape out. \n\n\n\"A successful operation,\" Frank Aiken says. \"Thank god for this. Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you sigh in relief, as the truck full of arms and released prisoners rolls free of the town.\n",

He grabs you by the collar, jamming the barrel of his revolver against your head. \n\n\n\"Pick up that fucking rifle and finish this, Michael!\" he screams, tears running down his face.\n\n\nYou stare down at your rifle as it sits in the mud, before shaking your head. Joseph scowl drops, as he drops his revolver.\n\n\n\"You bastard,\" he says sadly. \"You won\u0027t even give me a fucking ending to this whole shit show.\"\n\n\nJoseph releases his grip on you, letting out a sigh. He raises his hands, putting them behind his head and dropping to his knees.\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Surrendering.

Barricades are hastily erected, houses fortified into defensive outposts, prisoners armed and organized into garrisons to defend the various sections. Thankfully, you have more than enough time to set up the defense, and you\u0027re left waiting to repel the Free State soldiers.\n\n\nThere\u0027s a few small engagement with British patrols, but the main force don\u0027t arrive. You\u0027re left patiently waiting there, poised to strike as soon as they arrive, but they don\u0027t. \n\n\nOf course, when the first artillery shell tears through a nearby building, you realize why. You\u0027d counted on the fact that there are civilians to discourage the use of artillery, but it seems the Free State is more desperate to bring this thing to a close than you thought. They\u0027re armed with heavy fielder cannons, and as soon as they begin their barrage, you realize what a huge mistake you\u0027ve done.\n\n\nThe next shot tears throwing the street outside, sending chunks of pavement flying.

Over 400 rifles are taken, with 240 Republican prisoners being released. Quickly, you move patrols out, taking the town and routing the Free State soldiers from it.

You disgrace your whole nation of cowards and thieves!\"\n\n\n\"You know, your sister was a virgin, right? There was a lot of blood when I stuck my cock in her.\"\n\n\nYou go to scream at him, but he rushes you, patting on his rifle.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re surrounded by Unionists, talking to a group of veterans of the Great War, and proper Englishmen. It\u0027s best if you go up to the bar, pay for a round of drinks for us, and head home. Otherwise, we might not be so kind as to let you leave in such a nice condition.\"\n\n\n\"You fucking animals!\" you scream. \"You can\u0027t treat people like this!\"\n\n\n\"The crown says we can,\" Carter grins.\n\n\nYou turn to Joseph, who has quieted down, looking sternly ahead.\n\n\n\"Joseph, aren\u0027t you going to say something about this?!\" you ask in frustration.\n\n\n\"There\u0027s nothing to say to him. Best not to call him names,\" Joseph says. \"Ma taught us better than that.\"\n\n\n\"Listen to your brother and fuck off before this stops being amusing,\" Carter says. \n\n\n\"Ma taught us better,\" Joseph repeats. \"She taught us not to speak ill of the dead.\"\n\n\nJoseph draws his revolver, pointing it at the man\u0027s head, blowing out the back of his skull and painting the walls and his friends with brains and bloods. You look at the other Black and Tans, who all sit there in shock. There\u0027s a brief pause as silence fills the bar, as it takes a moment for everyone to comprehend what you\u0027ve just done.\n",

You swing again, before another one bashes you in the stomach. You grunt, collapsing to the ground, as they\u0027re upon you. Repeatedly, dozens of fists, boots and gun butts smash into you, quickly beating you quite severely as you\u0027re bloodied, bruised and battered. \n\n\nAfter the pair of you are beaten brutally, you\u0027re dragged outside of the pub, barely able to see what\u0027s happening. You\u0027re forced to your knees, as a rifle is pressed to the back of your head.\n\n\n\"By order of the fucking crown, we judge you a traitor and a terrorist, and sentence you to death,\" one of them says.\n\n\n\"Die, you fucking paddy,\" another jeers.\n\n\nThen, the gun goes off, blowing your brains out across the street.\n",

Lower your rifle!\" you shout.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not surrendering to let traitors take these guns and free these criminals!\" Fionn says. \"If you want to get past us, you\u0027re going to have to put a bullet in me!\"\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t make us, Fionn. If you don\u0027t give us a choice, we\u0027ll do what needs to be done!\" Joseph growls.\n\n\n\"You have a choice. Surrender to the Irish Free State, and you will be treated well! If you don\u0027t surrender, I will kill you!\" Fionn says.\n",
  "page 619": "You pull your rifle, your gun kicking in your hands as the rifle fires. The bullet explodes in Fionn\u0027s chest, as blood sprays onto the floor and he topples to the ground unceremoniously, dead within a second. The other Free State soldiers are quickly gunned down by the other member of the squad, and you\u0027re left standing there, eyes narrowing on Fionn\u0027s body.\n\n\n\"Fuck! FUCK!\" you say, rushing over to Fionn, grabbing his head as blood pools out and soaks into his pale blonde hair. \"Bollocks, it wasn\u0027t supposed to go down like this!\"\n\n\nThe next group of IRA soldiers surges into the building, to push forward with you to capture the barracks.\n\n\n\"Any wounded?\" one of them asks.\n\n\n\"No casualties. Push on and take this shit-hole,\" you say, lifting your heavy rifle into the air and marching forward.\n\n\nWith the element of surprise and numbers, the barracks is quickly taken over. Over 400 rifles are taken, with 240 Republican prisoners being released. Quickly, you move patrols out, taking the town and routing the Free State soldiers from it. Most are captured or escape off into the hills, with only a few kills. Perhaps it\u0027s because your troops are far more hesitant to shoot fellow Irishmen than they are British occupiers.\n\n\nQuickly, however, the next wave of Free State soldiers soon arrive and prepare a counter-attack to take back the town. Quickly, Frank Aiken assembles you and a few other high-ranking IRA soldiers whose opinions he trusts.\n\n\n\"We have a problem,\" Frank Aiken says. \"The Br...\"\n\n\nFrank Aiken pauses, almost forgetting himself. For many of you, Aiken included, it\u0027s been a hard transition to go from fighting British soldiers to former friends and comrades.\n\n\n\"The Free State have arrived in force. They\u0027re going to attempt to push us out of the city, and we need to decide how we\u0027re going to react before they organize and attack. I need opinions. I\u0027ve been considering a truce with them, to allow us to retreat with our captured weapons and freed comrade in exchange for the release of the men we captured. It seems like the most peaceful way this can end.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s too weak. We need to hit them hard, before they have a chance to properly organize. We can strike a hard blow, and push them back with ease,\" one of the soldiers says.\n\n\n\"No, we should hold down. We have the arms, we have the men, and we\u0027ll have the defensive advantage,\" a particularly qualified soldier named Sean F. Quinn says.\n\n\n\"And what do the McCarthy twins think? Joseph?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re not twins,\" Joseph says, as if disliking that notion. \"I don\u0027t make decisions. That\u0027s more of Michael\u0027s job. I just shoot guns and take over when we get into the kick of it.\"\n\n\n\"Well, then, Michael? What\u0027s your opinion on the matter?\"\n",
  "page 199": "\"You group the riflemen at one point,\" you say. \"That way, you have all your guns taking advantage of the element of surprise, plus you have the firepower. But, you keep two men further down the road in order to prevent the convoy from just charging straight through. That is, unless you can put up some sort of blockade, but if that would set the British off and be too obvious, then you need the two spare men down the road.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect!\" Ernie grins. \"The exact tactics that were used at the Soloheadbeg Ambush. The British won\u0027t have a bleedin\u0027 chance with men like you in this division! A shame you hadn\u0027t served in the rising or had IRB connections, because you\u0027d be a good section commander. All I can recommend is that you\u0027re put forward as the second.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you kindly,\" you nod.\n\n\n\"Anyhow, the tactic that Michael so kindly suggested is the one we\u0027re going to use to deal with the RIC convoy we\u0027re going to be raiding. That\u0027s our plan. The gracious Michael Collins have given us information on a weapons convoy we\u0027re going to hit.\"\n\n\nQuite a few of the men around you nod eagerly. Apparently, Michael Collins has made quite a reputation for himself in Frongoch, and now as the Minister of Finance of Dáil Eireann, a commander of the IRA, and director of information, he\u0027s a very powerful man. He controls vast networks of informants, and a near mystical group of assassins known as the Squad, or the Twelve Disciples, that hunt down spies and informants as well as performing assassinations.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re going to hit them to fully arm this group. Until then, we\u0027re using weapons borrowed from Liam Lynch and the No. 2 Cork Brigade. We\u0027re going to hit in the formation discussed, and wipe out the convoy. I\u0027ll be taking the ten best shots here, so let\u0027s get to work and show me what you can do.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the day is spent drilling and going over tactics, as well as O\u0027Malley and the locals establishing the various levels fo support held for them among all the various locals. Various safe houses and villages with high nationalist tendencies, as well as areas with a high unionist presence that are likely to be filled with informants. The locations of various RIC barracks and where the presence of the British army is strongest, as well as the area that this branch was expected to deal with, a large section of outer and rural Dublin. It\u0027s going to be hard work, and you\u0027re under-supplied, under-armed and under-supported, but most importantly, you\u0027re underestimated. The Crown think the problem in Ireland is a bunch of peasants mucking about in their pigsties, trying to rise up without knowing what they\u0027re doing. \n\n\nThey\u0027ll learn never to underestimate an Irishman.\n",

Who\u0027s ready?\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a roar among the men, and the officer smiles.\n\n\n\"Come on then, boys! For king! For country! For England! CHARGE!\"\n\n\nThe soldiers urge forward, and you grab the trench wall, pulling yourself over, heading straight into the thick of it.\n\n\nYou find yourself transported into hell. You peer your head over the edge of the trench, staring out into the horrors of war. Barbed wire covers the muddy ground between the two trenches, covered in the scars of artillery strikes. Gas covers the battlefield, slowly spreading out like a yellow tide. Gunfire flashes from the enemy trench, and you watch as one of the charging men next to you explodes in a burst of crimson, writhing under the force of the bullets.\n\n\n\"Charge! Charge!\" the officer screams, as you rush forward. A soldier screams as he falls to the ground from a gut wound, as your men surge forward into the meat grinder.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s a fucking massacre!\" Fitzpatrick says, his cool facade breaking. \"I don\u0027t...!\"\n\n\nFitzpatrick takes a bullet to the throat, as a huge, bleeding, gaping hole is blown through his neck. He collapses to the ground, bleeding to death in front of you.\n\n\n\"Fitzpatrick!\" you yell, before a soldier shoves you forward.\n\n\n\"We can\u0027t stop, push forward!\" the soldier screams.\n\n\nYou look around, seeing a straight dash to the enemy trench, a path through the area the artillery is mainly striking and a partially covered path of barbed wire.\n\n\nAnother hail of gunfire rips through the ranks of soldiers, as Douglas\u0027 leg is blown clean off. He falls to the ground, not even screaming, only staring at his leg in pure shock. You stand there, as the world goes  silent, the bullets now just a gentle thudding in the back of your head. You stand there, staring at Douglas as the blood gushes out of his leg. \n\n\nAfter a brief moment, he begins to scream in horrific pain, bringing you back to reality. You look around frantically, seeing a straight dash to the enemy trench, a path through the area the artillery is mainly striking and a partially covered path of barbed wire. Douglas continues to sit on the ground, screaming.\n",

Your boot catches on a strand of barbed wire ,the metal thorn cutting through your pants leg and slicing a long but thankfully shallow cut on your leg.

Horse-mounted calvary charges being cut down by machine gun fire in horrific massacres.

Endless, hellish days of artillery raining down, sniper fire every moment striking down anyone they see, the worst nightmares come to life. \n\n\nAfter far too much training, you\u0027re finally sent out to fight. Unfortunately, there\u0027s a lot of patrolling and not a lot of actual combat. It\u0027s probably fortunate that you\u0027re kept out of war, kept safe, mostly left with patrolling and guarding trenches where miraculously, you aren\u0027t attacked once. The food is shit, the weather\u0027s awful, there\u0027s constant fear of diseases, and although you\u0027re safe, the role is just incredibly boring. Still, after about a year of boring work, you find yourself shipped to Turkey. It\u0027s not the Huns you were expecting, but the Ottomans are as important a part of the Central Powers as the Huns. You suppose in a way you\u0027re still protecting Belgium by hitting Germany\u0027s allies, although it feels more and more like you\u0027re just a pawn being used to battle the wars of an Empire rather than a real soldier fighting for a country\u0027s freedom.\n\n\nYou find yourself walking along a muddy trench, a rifle in your hands as you creep forward. The trenches are filled with cold water and mud, enough of which has seeped into your boots that sepsis is a serious issue. The sound of machine gun fire and artillery shells is booming, as you move into the forward trench. Machine guns crackle around you, as you keep your head low. You\u0027ve never even seen an enemy soldier, but according to your sergeant, you\u0027re to prepare for a charge soon enough. \n",

You crawl forward, moving past the broken bodies.\n\n\nSuddenly, a pair of hands begins to burst out from the corpses, gripping your leg. You turn, to see a dying soldier, his legs blow clean off, his chest a mess of blood and blown apart chunks of flesh. His hands desperately claw at you as he begs for help, his hands wrapping around you. Knowing you can\u0027t help her, there\u0027s only one thing left to do. You close your eyes, crawling forward as the weak hand releases it\u0027s grip, sliding off your leg as you climb off.\n\n\nYou keep pushing forward, before you near the trench.

You groan, your head fuzzy as you realize your helmet has blown off. You see it lying next to you and grabbing, taking note of the piece of shrapnel you pull off that would\u0027ve taken off your head if not for the helmet. You quickly look over your body, but thankfully you\u0027re alright, and none of the shrapnel hit other than a minor cut across your knee.\n\n\nYou grab your helmet, prying the shard of shrapnel from it as you take the helmet in your hand. You pop it back on, before you begin to cough and splutter as the air begins to sting. You turn your head, spotting a tide of gas enveloping you. You cough as your eyes and mouth begin to burn, as you shut your mouth and try to stumble out of the spreading gas cloud. Suddenly, your lungs force you take a deep breath as your lungs fill with gas.

He speaks Gaelic like a true Fenian. At first, the guards feared you were plotting a break out, but it wasn\u0027t long before they learnt you mainly talked about which prisoner had the biggest nose or which guard had the thickest accent. You\u0027re not action heroes, you don\u0027t plan to take on the whole camp to escape. Plus, at this point, you\u0027ve befriended most of the guards, and you can\u0027t imagine having to kill one of them. \n\n\n\"What is it?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The guards are rounding us up! We need to go!\"\n\n\nYou look around, noticing several other prisoners just miling about in the open fenced area you\u0027re currently in, before raising an eyebrow.\n\n\n\"What about them?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Irish only!\" Coogan says.\n\n\n\"If you say so,\" you say curiously.\n\n\nYou walk with Coogan, followed him to the one of the large housing units for prisoners, Cell Block D. A German Guard leans against the wall outside, a cigarette in his mouth.\n\n\n\"Irish, yes?\" he says in his thick, German accent.\n\n\nAlthough it takes you a moment to decipher his accent, you nod vigorously.\n\n\n\"Yes, yes, Irish,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Where are you from?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"Dublin,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"Tipperary,\" Coogan says.\n\n\nThe German cracks a grin, nodding.\n\n\n\"Ah, Tipperary, I know that place!\" he says, before he starts singing an old tune. \"It\u0027s a long way to Tipperary, it\u0027s a long way to go!\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Coogan laughs, nodding. \"That\u0027s the tune.\"\n\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" the soldier says stepping aside.\n\n\n\"Why are we here?\" you ask him.\n\n\n\"There is an Irishman here to see you all,\" he says.\n\n\n\"An Irishman?\" you ask, intrigued, as you surge into the room with Coogan.\n\n\nYou look around the room at the others there. McCardle, a fisherman who was captured in France, a cheerful fellow whose smile is easily recognizable by the set of black and yellow teeth he has. O\u0027Connor, a farmer like yourself, a hard-working, friendly chap. Johnston, a mild-mannered postman whose sister you used to know from the local dance halls. There\u0027s a few others you recognize, but most prominent in the room is a tall, well-spoken man who everyone\u0027s crowded around.\n\n\nThe tall man has a thick black beard that\u0027s quite well-groomed, with a long, thin mustache that sprouts from either side of his cheek. He has short, curly black hair and pointy features, with his ears sticking out slightly. He swears a striped suit with its collar up, tight around his neck, looking like he\u0027s ready for a formal ball.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re Irish?\" Coogan asks loudly, as the man smiles. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m from Sandy Cove. South east of Dún Laoghaire and Glasthule, of you know it.\"\n\n\nYou nod vigorously, grinning.\n\n\n\"A fellow Dubliner!\" you say. \"What brings you here?\"\n\n\n\"Simple, my good fellow. I am Sir Roger Casement,\" he says.\n\n\nYou pause, as there\u0027s a hush of whispers. You know that name. Roger Casement was a humanitarian. He worked in far off, distant countries like the Congo and Peru, helping the poor negroes who were being abused by the British in power there, just like you Irish were. However, he was knighted by the King for doing so. The British King, King George V. You narrow your eyes, wondering what he\u0027s doing here.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sure by this long in captivity you\u0027ve seen that the Germans aren\u0027t the villains you were told. They haven\u0027t forsaken the Lord Jesus Christ, they don\u0027t torture prisoners, they don\u0027t eat babies!\"\n\n\n\"I wish they did,\" McCardle says. \"We could use some meat in our rations.\"\n\n\nThe group laughs, as Casement nods, smiling.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sure you could. But, in such a time of trouble, the poor Irish souls that have seen such little opportunity have been awarded a great deal of it. The British grasp on Ireland is weakening as it focuses on the Central Powers. For the first time in history, we have a chance to do something about that.\"\n\n\nRoger Casement pauses, looking around at the faces around him. You try to make out his emotions, but you can\u0027t, his face unchanging as stone.\n\n\n\"Germany is willing to release you, to accompany me on our return to Ireland. They\u0027re offering us arms, rifles and machine guns, in order to return to our comrades in Ireland. There, they plan an uprising on a national level. We have a chance to liberate our nation with our brothers, to claim Ireland as a free, independent republic!\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll be hung,\" someone says, scared. \"We\u0027re just prisoners now. We join you, we become traitors!\" \n\n\n\"My friend, there will be no one to hang us! The free nation of Ireland will see us as heroes, and Britain won\u0027t be able to do anything about that!\" Casement says. \"Our brothers at home risk hanging! Do you think they fear? Of course not, my friend. Of course not! Now, I offer you a chance at freedom. Not only your own freedom, but the freedom of the entire nation! Together, Ireland will rise up, new and free! What men will stand with me?!\"\n\n\nYou pause, thinking his offer through. A chance to liberate your nation, but at what cost? Betraying the British you fought alongside to serve the Huns? Risking death as a traitor? But of course, is there a price too great for freedom?\n",
  "page 45": "As a prisoner, you\u0027re rounded up with the others taken from the battle and pushed back to the secondary trenches to avoid a recapture attempt. From there, you\u0027re taken inwards to a POW camp.\n\n\nThe stay there is surprisingly tolerable. A few of the Turks speak English, and they\u0027re actually quite a friendly people. You\u0027re treated quite well, with relatively good food and a warm cot.\n\n\nHowever, as the war turns, you and a few other POWs are transported to Germany, where you end up in another POW camp in Germany. The Huns are even kinder than the Ottomans. They treat you well, and with respect. You wonder why this war even needed to happen. You don\u0027t care for things being disputed for in the war. Neither do the German soldiers, mostly poor peasants like yourself, recruited to fight other poor peasants as the Kings and Queens that sent you out to die don\u0027t miss a meal. Their worries aren\u0027t the Ardennes Offensive, they worry about feeding their families, surviving the war and returning home, and making sure their farm isn\u0027t destroyed in the chaos. \n\n\nYou\u0027re not sure how the war is going, as the Germans try to keep you from learning, but you think your allies are succeeding. However, seeing what your enemies are like, you wonder why you should care who wins. All you hope for it peace.\n",

Among you, not a single man is willing to join him.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re not traitors!

He\u0027s more disappointed than angry or annoyed. After a moment, he nods firmly.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll serve my country, even if you will not. If I\u0027m to liberate Ireland alone, I\u0027ll do it. All I wanted was some comrades willing to serve Ireland like I am. I see now there\u0027s none of them to be found here.\"\n\n\nRoger Casement turns, walking quickly off. Your fellow Irishmen jeer and mock as he walks away, but you just feel sad more than anything else, watching the pathetic man. He\u0027s trying to serve his country, he\u0027s just doing it with a fool\u0027s errand that will never work.\n",

Your sons, your daughters, your grandchildren, they thank you!\"\n\n\nYou look around the room, waiting for an onrush of support for Casement, but you find it\u0027s disturbingly silent.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re not traitors!

Let\u0027s go,\" he says.\n\n\nRoger Casement turns, strolling off as you walk with him, heading off. You let out a sigh, as your fellow Irishmen jeer and mock as you all walk away. \n\n\nThey\u0027ll thank you one day. If not them, then their children will.

It\u0027s them who you\u0027ll use to takeover, they\u0027ll be the main fighting force used. With them, your dreams of a free and independent Ireland can be accomplished.\n\n\nHopefully, you\u0027ll see Joseph again. You\u0027re sure if there\u0027s something like this coming about, he\u0027ll be there.\n\n\nCasement\u0027s Brigade is given 20,000 Mosin-Nagant 1891 rifles, good, durable weapons that will serve your people well, alongside ten new machine guns, as well as large quantities of ammo. However, they refuse to send trained German soldiers with you, not even giving you a single German officer to help organize and lead the uprising. Plus, the machine-gun training promised to you never comes, so these powerful machines of death are of little use to you, as you barely understand how to use them.\n\n\nStill, there\u0027s hope. It\u0027s mainly up to the Irish at home, but you know you\u0027ll be able to do it, for Ireland.\n",
  "page 40": "You charge with the bayonet, ramming the blade at the man\u0027s chest. He grabs the gun barrel, pushing the bayonet away from you as it sinks into the dirt walls of the trench. You twist the rifle to try and pull it out, of the wall, but the bayonet snaps off the rifle uselessly.\n\n\nSuddenly, you\u0027re tackled, sent flying to the ground. Your head smacks off against the wooden walling of the trench, although thankfully your helmet absorbs most of the blow. You groan, turning to see that an Ottoman soldier, younger than even you, is standing there. \n\n\nYou look around desperately, seeing your gun resting next to you. The Ottoman screams something in his barbaric tongue, although you don\u0027t understand a word of it.\n",
  "page 42": "You reach for your gun, grabbing it and quickly raising it, aiming down the sights. The Ottoman man fires, two shots thudding into you with such speed you don\u0027t even feel it. You pull the trigger, blowing a hole out of the Ottoman man\u0027s throat. He collapses next to you as you feel the blood start to soak through your uniform. Your entire body goes cold, as you shiver, terrified. \n\n\nThe other man lets out a horrified, gurgling gasp as he reaches out for help in the darkening world. The two of you lie there, and for a moment, you wonder why you both needed to kill each other. It\u0027s clear to you he\u0027s just another peasant, the same as you, fighting in a war between two kings, just left there, dying in a war started by the rich.\n\n\nAs your vision goes dark, you grab the man\u0027s arm as he lies there panting next to you, giving it a gentle squeeze before your eyes roll to the back of your head.\n",
  "page 55": "Within two years, the war has fallen apart. Back in a POW camp, you\u0027re imprisoned once again, going through the same bullshit. You\u0027re moved to another camp, with all the reports of your betrayal of the empire being lost to the pangs of bureaucracy so you hope that you\u0027ll manage to escape the hangman\u0027s noose when the Brit\u0027s take over. Still, Germany\u0027s losing the war. The Germans try to hide that fact from you, but given that the rations grow smaller and there\u0027s less and less guards everyday, it\u0027s clear.\n\n\nEventually, German surrenders, and the Central Powers buckle. With morale failing, the German people were left without a will to fight, and with their industrial production being crushed, they lost the means to do so. The Central Powers crumbled under the Summer Offensive of the Allied powers, finishing off the Great War.\n\n\nWith Germany\u0027s fall, you and the rest of the POWs are released. Thankfully, it seems due to the records of the falling Germany leaving everything to fall apart, Britain\u0027s doesn\u0027t find out about you agreeing to Casement\u0027s offer. Like the rest of them, you\u0027re sent back to the Ireland.\n",
  "page 54": "You stay in Germany, allowing Casement to travel back to Ireland without you, as he instead takes Sergeant Daniel Bailey. Unfortunately, at this point, it all turns to shit.\n\n\nCasement attempts to travel to Ireland via a German submarine, to meet with the other leaders. His plans were to convince them to call it off, as they didn\u0027t have the arms or manpower to succeed. Ironically, he was caught and arrested before he could do so, and imprisoned. In order to avoid setting off alarm bells, the Irish revolutionaries made no attempt to rescue him, focusing on the upcoming rising. \n\n\nIn Easter, 1916, the rising began, but it was doomed to fail from the beginning. Disputes among the Irish volunteers meant that only a fraction of the members showed up for the rising, with the rest staying home. Little over twelve hundred Irish men fought, against a thousand British Royal Constabularies, and sixteen thousand British troops. There was a lot of early success, with the rebels securing key points of the city, but when the British reacted with full force, even sailing a gunboat up the river Liffey to shell the city, they were forced to surrender to avoid more civilian causalities for a lost cause.\n\n\nThe rebels counted sixty six brave Irish men among the dead. The British lost a hundred and forty three. Of course, they combined were less than half the dead. No, the true losers were the civilians, poor Irish men and women like yourself, like your family. Two hundred and sixty men were killed, with thousands more being injured.\n\n\nCasement was executed for treason, along with sixteen of the main leaders of the uprising. One of the men, James Connolly, was so wounded by the fighting he couldn\u0027t even stand for the firing squad. They had to prop him up in a chair before the firing squad could finish him off. Casement wasn\u0027t even given the honor of a soldier\u0027s death. After his knighthood was taken away, he was hung like a dog, like a common criminal, like only an Irishman ever is.\n\n\nOver the next six months, the reaction to this changes, surprisingly. While initially, the rebels seem like villains, disturbing the peace and betraying Britain while she faces the evil Huns in the Great War, this quickly changes.\n\n\nEarly on, dozens of cases of atrocities committed by the British come out. Prisoners having been executed in the fighting. The destruction of property out of spite. The use of a pacifist activist as a human shield. Journalists being rounded up and executed by firing quad. Over a dozen civilians being rounded up and shot or bayoneted to death. All of that didn\u0027t even take into account Britain\u0027s indiscriminate shelling of the area. All of this coming to light quickly turns public favor, as makes the rebels, who took care to avoid civilian casualties, seem like the heroes of this uprising. Just as Padraig Pearse wanted, his men didn\u0027t achieve a tactical victory, but have become painted as martyrs for a cause, gaining huge support and lighting the fire of patriotism in the soul of every Irishman there.\n\n\nThen, the British saw fit to execute the sixteen key figures of the rising: Pádraic Pearse, Thomas Clarke, MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, Edward Daly, Michael O\u0027Hanrahan, Willie Pearse, John MacBride, Eamonn Ceantt, Michael Mallin, Sean Heuston, Con Colbert, Thomas Kent, Séan MacDiarmada and James Connolly.\n\n\nThese executions further made the British seem as oppressors rather than peace-keepers. Some of those executed weren\u0027t even leaders of the rising. John MacBride hadn\u0027t been aware of the rising until it began, while Thomas Kent hadn\u0027t participated in it. The manner of execution was worse. John Connolly was so wounded he had to be tied in a chair to stay standing before his firing squad. Joseph Plunkett married his wife Grace Gifford, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism, seven hours before his execution. They weren\u0027t allowed to speak to each other or touch each other. He was shot later that day.\n\n\nStories like this quickly turned public support in favor of the rebels. Support for Sinn Féin, a nationalist political party, surged, as republicanism gained massive support. It became clear Britain was sitting on a powder keg as it tried to focus on dealing with this. With Sinn Féin rising into power, republicanism on the rise and a desperate longing for independence arising in the Irish zeitgeist, it seems clear that violence is coming. \n\n\nYou, however? Well, you\u0027re straight shit out of luck. Without Casement or hopes of an Irish Brigade, the Germans toss you back into prison, where you can rot.\n",
  "page 57": "\"You go that way!\" you whisper loudly. \"I\u0027ll lure them off, give you a better chance of completing the mission.\"\n\n\nYou quickly begin moving the opposite direction, hoping to get out of there. You rush forward, waiting to get far enough away to be able to get around to luring them off. Unfortunately, you don\u0027t even need to, as the rising sun makes it just about bright enough that you don\u0027t really have a chance.\n\n\n\"I see something! It\u0027s one of them!\" a voice yells in the darkness, no doubt a British soldier.\n\n\n\"Take the shot! He can\u0027t get away!\" another growls.\n\n\nYour chest explodes in a burst of blood. You manage to run another dozen steps, before smacking into the ground. You lie there, your lungs filling with warm blood as you struggle to breath, choking on your own blood. You lie there, dying pitifully, as all you can do is hope that your efforts divert the chase and Casement escapes.\n",
  "page 56": "You begin sprinting after Casement and Monteith, running alongside them as you hurry towards the fort as quickly as you can. Casement stumbles and you quickly move to his side, grabbing him and helping him keep going.\n\n\n\"Can\u0027t go down now, sir!\" you say hurriedly. \"We have too much to do, remember?\"\n\n\nYou keep going, raising through the dark. It\u0027s only a matter of time before the British discovers your rowboat, and then you\u0027re screwed. Or the sun rises, letting them see you, and then you\u0027re screwed. Or their search net stumbles across you, and then you\u0027re screwed.\n\n\n\"I think I see something!\" a soldier yells.\n\n\n\"Labhair de na diabhal,\" you mutter.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s them! It\u0027s fucking them,\" another soldier yells.\n\n\nYou keep going, before you see the old, ancient stones of the ring fort, laid by the ancient Celts of old. True, free Irishmen. You hurry towards the stones, running past them as you enter the land where once stood a huge Fenian fort.\n\n\nCasement slips from your grasp, crumpling to the ground. He lies there, breathing heavily and staring at you meekly.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll never make it,\" Casement says. \"All we can do now is pray for the rebellion to succeed, with God\u0027s graces.\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re fucked,\" Monteith says. \"Éireann will weep for us.\"\n\n\n\"We can\u0027t go out like this! We\u0027ll hang! We\u0027ll fucking hang!\" you say, desperately. \n\n\nYou don\u0027t have a way to escape this. You\u0027ll be meeting God almighty at Heaven\u0027s gates soon enough. But it\u0027s your choice how you\u0027re getting there.\n",
  "page 59": "\"Stay back, you fucking bastards!\" you yell, raising your rifle and firing. \"I\u0027m not going to go down without a fight!\"\n\n\nYou lean over the chunk of ancient Celtic stone, staring down the iron sights. You find a British soldier in the sights, pulling the trigger as the man crumples. You switch to another shadow moving through the night, trying to make out his form as he moves through the darkness. You raise your rifle, firing as the man drops. \n\n\nBullets bounce off the stone around you, but you keep out of cover, aiming. You\u0027re ready to die here. You refuse to go down without taking a few of them out. However, you\u0027re outnumbered, and even your training in the war won\u0027t get you out of this one.\n\n\nA well-placed shot by a British soldier hits you in the forehead, sending you stumbling backwards, blood covering your face. You hit the ground, raising your hand up to your face to press your fingers against the grazing wound. You take a deep breath, focusing your attention as you move to stand.\n\n\nYou try to stand, wiping the blood from your eyes so you can see better, but by now the soldiers have moved forward, raising their rifles. A volley of shots goes off, and you collapse to the ground, no more.\n",
  "page 50": "It\u0027s all gone to shit. Hell in a fucking hand basket. \n\n\nThe gun running was a mass failure. A German cargo ship was heavily disguised as a Norwegian vessel. Given Norway\u0027s neutrality, it was thought this would get the weapons through. The ship bore Norwegian colors, the crew wore Norwegian clothes, all the charts and books were even in fucking Norwegian, yet it to shit. The British apprehended the ship, forcing the crew to blow their ship up, sinking it to avoid capture.\n\n\nDesperately, Casement plans to head to Ireland, to inform the rebel leaders of the change in plans and the necessity to postpone the uprising until a more better time. He plans to sneak their via submarine with German assistance, and has asked you to go with him. As an Irishman, you\u0027ll have no trouble blending in when you arrive, plus, having an extra man to assist in convincing the rebel leaders wouldn\u0027t go astray. \n",
  "page 53": "The rowboat hits onto the beach of sand, as you and Casement step off, onto the sands. Robert Monteith follows you afterwards, grinning.\n\n\n\"Home,\" Roger says weakly. \"Thank fuck.\"\n\n\nCasement\u0027s been sick for some time. At first you thought it was simple seasickness or claustrophobia, but now you\u0027re beginning to fear it\u0027s the return of his here-and-there malaria sickness he picked up in the Congo. He\u0027s pale, tired and sickly, and without a car, you don\u0027t know how far he can go. As there\u0027s British patrols everywhere due to a possible leak of information, it\u0027s going to be hard getting out of here.\n\n\n\"We have a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it. Let\u0027s go,\" Monteith says. \"But it damn sure is good to be here. Something special about Irish air, isn\u0027t there?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re in a fucking hurry,\" you say, keeping your mind on the mission. \"There\u0027s British soldiers prowling around these beaches. We need to do this quick and clean.\" \n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go then,\" Casement says weakly.\n\n\nYou rush up the beach, hurrying to get away from this scene and get somewhere safe. There\u0027s a few safe houses you could visit on the way, supporters of the uprising you\u0027ve been referred to who\u0027d be happy to keep the three of you for a night or two. \n\n\nAs you reach the lip of the beach, you frown, as you spy a few lanterns in the distance, floating in the near completely black early morn.\n\n\n\"Shit, they\u0027re here,\" you say. \"We need to get out of here fast, before the British get us. \n\n\n\"I know this area,\" Robert says. \"There\u0027s an old Celtic ring fort nearby. We can hide from the patrols there.\"\n\n\nYou pause, looking at Casement. You doubt he\u0027ll be fast in this state. He might not even be able to make it at all. You need to do something.\n\n\n\"We head to the fort, then,\" Casement nods, as he weakly begins half-running in the direction ring fort.\n",

With that, you wander off down the street towards the Irish Volunteers\u0027 headquarters.\n\n\n\"You hear about the massacre in the Ottoman Empire?\" Morgan asks. \"Brits got their ass handed to them. They say the war\u0027s going to stretch on again.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s for the best that England\u0027s staring out at the Central Powers instead of pressing their boot down on our necks,\" you point out.\n\n\nYou stroll past Liberty Halls, where the Irish Citizen Army is based out of. A banner hangs over the door, proclaiming \"We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland\". Although the workers there aren\u0027t members of the Irish Volunteers, they might as well be. Their views only differ economically, and you know if push comes to shove you\u0027ll stand by them and they\u0027ll stand by you.\n\n\nYou tip your hat as you pass one of the Irish Citizen Army soldiers, and he smiles and tips his.\n\n\n\"How are things? Connolly still promising to give you the Prod\u0027s money, Stevens?\" you ask with a grin.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll get it once MacNeill gets the first words of Irish boys and girls to be in Gaeilge,\" the man replies, strolling past. \"We won\u0027t have a penny in our pockets, but as long the word on our tongue is in Gaelic he\u0027ll be happy.\"\n\n\nYou both chuckle as you walk past, before you continue on your walk to the headquarters.\n\n\nIt\u0027s a short but brisk walk before arrive at the drilling ground. A few small buildings stand around a large field where the Volunteers mill about. Many of them are crowded around the corner of field in a field, seemingly investigating something. Your commanding officer, Francis, stands by one of the houses, leaning against it.  He notices you, and walks over.\n\n\n\"McCarthy\u0027s! Grab a pair or rifles from the store room and hurry up! We\u0027ve drilling to do.\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s going on over there?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Countess Markievicz is visiting to see what the boys are like,\" Francis replies. \"Go see her, if you want.

She joined the Irish Citizen Army, donating all of her wealth to either funding soup kitchens, funding the ICA\u0027s strike for worker writings during the Great Lock-Out of 1913 and even designed the ICA uniform and anthem. Perhaps the best way to describe her is with advice she gave out to Irish women, with the line \"Dress suitably in short skirts and strong boots, leave your jewels in the bank and buy a revolver.\" \n\n\nShe stands in full uniform, her hat pulled low and her green uniform making her look more like a man than a woman. By her side is a revolver so large you know it could take off a man\u0027s head.\n\n\n\"Gentlemen, I\u0027m looking for volunteers for the nearby soup kitchen Sunday coming. The fight for independence is fought with a knife, but that knife should be used for peeling potatoes to feed those in need as as much as a bayonet.\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a few promises to work, before the Countess bids you to go off and drill, before leaving.\n",

Joseph was among the rebels that the traitor Casement would\u0027ve had you fighting alongside. While you and the British soldiers were fighting in the Great War, he was butchering them at home.

  "page 63": "From what you hear, the uprising is a failure. Although they don\u0027t want to tell you, many of the German guards are sympathetic, and reveal that Casement has been caught and hung alongside the rebel leaders, after the rising was defeated after hundreds of deaths. The rebels surrendered, being transported to some British prison camp. After a few months, they were released in an attempt to appease Irish citizens, although from what you\u0027ve heard, the nation of Ireland is alight with anger towards the Crown for their behavior during the uprising. All you can hope is this doesn\u0027t stain the records of all you brave men who fought for Ireland and England alike.\n\n\nWithin two years, the war has fallen apart. In the POW camp, life is still alright. You have your friends, the guards are nice, if getting more solemn as the war turns, and even though your rations grow less and less so every week, you survive. The war is being lost by Germany, though. The Germans try to hide that fact from you, but given that the rations grow smaller and there\u0027s less and less guards everyday, it\u0027s clear.\n\n\nEventually, German surrenders, and the Central Powers buckle. With morale failing, the German people were left without a will to fight, and with their industrial production being crushed, they lost the means to do so. The Central Powers crumbled under the Summer Offensive of the Allied powers, finishing off the Great War.\n\n\nWith Germany\u0027s fall, an armistice is reached while Germany desperately tries to hold onto at least some of it\u0027s power rather than being completed annihilated, you and the rest of the POWs are released in a prisoner exchange.

We spent the past few days in our farm in the country.\"\n\n\n\"How do we know that\u0027s true?\" the first soldier asks.\n\n\n\"Well, he wasn\u0027t captured, so he\u0027s not a rebel.\"\n\n\n\"He could\u0027ve escaped,\" one of the soldiers says.\n\n\n\"If he had escaped, why would I have brought him back here to risk being captured.\"\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" he admits. \"Just stay back from the prisoners.\"\n\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" you say, stepping away.\n\n\nJoseph nods slowly, also stepping back.\n\n\n\"Whatever you say, sir,\" he says.\n",
  "page 128": "You walk over to the old couple, tipping your hat to them as Joseph does the same.\"\n\n\n\"Good day to you,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"Good morning. How are you two doing?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Good day to you,\" the man replies. \"Such a shame what\u0027s happened to this city, isn\u0027t it? All for a few radicals\u0027 ideals? Awful. The beautiful city like this being tarnished so awfully.\"\n\n\n\"They\u0027re trying to free Ireland,\" Joseph says. \"Isn\u0027t that worth a bit of sacrifice?\"\n\n\n\"I absolutely want a free Ireland, I want it with all my heart. I voted for Sinn Féin my entire life,\" the man says. \"But I never condone violence. Look at all this chaos. The bloodshed, the destruction, the gloom. Such a shame. I wanted politicians to free Eireann, not armed thugs. I\u0027ll tell you this, the entire city is against these ruffians.\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027ve tried politics,\" Joseph says tersely. \"And we still don\u0027t have even a parliament to pretend to be our own nation with.\"\n\n\n\"That was postponed to focus on the war! Britain needed us to focus to help them repel those vicious Huns, and these men have betrayed Britain\u0027s trust\" the woman says. \"We were happy, safe and doing well under the British rule. They treated us better than they ever had. Now these vandals have gone and caused a bunch of issues. Now the British will treat worse than ever, and we\u0027ll deserve you.\"\n\n\n\"Betrayed? The Huns never imprisoned us, never shot our priests, burned our...!\" Joseph begins to say, his voice grower louder and angrier.\n\n\nYou grab Joseph\u0027s wrist, squeezing it tightly.\n\n\n\"Calm down, would you?\" you growl. \"Apologies. My brother\u0027s a very passionate man. Personally, I can\u0027t disagree with either of you. I must be on my way, but it was a pleasure talking to the both of you. Have a good day.\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll be off. A good day to you two as well,\" the woman says.\n",
  "page 249": "With that, you begin the long journey home. It takes some time, and as you arrive, the sun is just disappearing over the hill, vanishing from your site. You push open the door to the same house, walking inside. Joseph and Ma sit at the kitchen table. Joseph\u0027s reading a book, while Ma stares, worried looking into the candle that sits in the middle of the table. You sit down next to her, putting the groceries onto the table. You pull out the bottle of apple juice, sliding it over to her.\n\n\n\"Here you are,\" you say. \"How are you doing, anyway?\"\n\n\n\"I... ah, you know,\" Ma says, absent-mindedly, her gaze not shifting from the flame.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Mary\u0027s gone missing,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Mary is an hour late to get home,\" Joseph says. \"She\u0027s not gone missing.\"\n\n\n\"Mary is never home late,\" Ma says. \"Never.\"\n\n\n\"She\u0027s probably out with Arthur,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Arthur\u0027s a good boy, he never ends of being late,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Never thought I\u0027d here you say that about a Unionist,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"We need to go out and look for her,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s fine,\" you say. \"She\u0027s a grown woman. She\u0027ll be home soon.\"\n\n\nYou quickly begin preparing dinner, getting the stove going and boiling the potatoes and getting everything ready. You make sure you\u0027re cooking up enough for Mary as well, because like Ma says, it\u0027s strange she\u0027s late. She\u0027ll definitely be home for dinner.\n\n\nYou\u0027re halfway through finishing dinner when the door to the farmhouse opens, as Mary arrives home.\n\n\n\"Thank Christ,\" you mutter under your breath, walking out to the entrance to the home.\n\n\nMary stands there, in the worst state you\u0027ve ever seen her in. Her hair is slick with blood, sticking to the side of her face as it smears it red. Her face is heavily bruised from what must\u0027ve been one serious beating. Her dress is nearly torn off her, with several tears along the skirt. Tears run down her discolored cheeks, as her lip quivers from the trauma of her night. A long cut runs across her forehead, disappearing to her hairline, with a trickle of blood running down her face and soaking her hair and scap with the dark blood. Her inner thighs and legs are slick with blood and... you grimace, as Mary stares at you with a distant, deadened look.\n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you say. \"Ma! Joseph! Get down here!\"\n\n\nYou rush over to her, wrapping her up as she presses her face into the the nook of your neck and shoulder. Ma and Joseph arrive on scene. Ma lets out a horrified shriek, running over to her daughter and giving her a tight hug as you step back.\n\n\n\"Oh my dear God, sweet God above, what\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened you?\" \n\n\n\"I... I was walking home, and he attacked me,\" she says in between sobs. \n\n\n\"Who? Who fucking did it?\" Joseph shouts.\n\n\n\"Calm down, Joseph,\" you say, grabbing his arm.\n\n\n\"Calm down? Don\u0027t you know what they did to her?!\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"And she doesn\u0027t need you yelling at her. Take it easy.\" \n\n\n\"Carter. The others called him Carter,\" she says softly. \n\n\n\"Leave her alone!\" Ma hisses, tears streaming down her face. \"Come on, sweetheart, you\u0027re alright, you\u0027re alright.\"\n\n\nMa leads Mary to the bed as she continuously sobs, as you\u0027re left with Joseph. You pause, staring blankly at Joseph, who is absolutely fuming with rage.\n\n\n\"That fucking bastard raped her,\" Joseph says. \"We\u0027ve been putting up with far too much, far too much bullshit because of cockroaches like these. We need to deal with him. This can\u0027t be left stand.\"\n\n\n\"We go group up the IRA unit, organize an ambush. Blow Carter\u0027s head off with a fucking rifle and deal with this shit,\" you say.\n\n\n\"No, we can\u0027t involve the unit. It\u0027s not their job to deal with this. It\u0027s ours,\" Joseph says. \"We confront the fucker man to man, right now.\"\n\n\n\"Then we do that. Either way, we finish this.\"\n",
  "page 77": "\"I\u0027m in,\" Joseph says, as you shake your head.\n\n\n\"No. No, I\u0027m not going to join,\" you say, as Joseph turns to look at you.\n\n\n\"Well, that\u0027s a shame,\" Seamus says. \"From what Dougal said, you would\u0027ve fought well for this country\u0027s freedom. Well, we all know what needs to be done. If you want to join us, Joseph, you must kill Michael to preserve our secret.\"\n\n\nYou and Joseph both turn to stay at Seamus, who stares at you. Suddenly, the corners of his mouth turn ever so slightly upward, as a smile breaks out.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m kidding. Jesus, have a sense of humor,\" Seamus says, before every sits there in silence. \"Well? What are you waiting for. If you don\u0027t want to join, go home.\"\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t you want to... like, threaten me so I stay quiet?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re a smart lad. I know you can figure out what you should and shouldn\u0027t do.\"\n\n\nWith that, you stand up. You look to Joseph, who only seems happy to sit there, unresponsive and seemingly content to stay. You shake your head. No matter. You walk out of the bar and into the bright day. You begin strolling along the sidewalk, heading home.\n",
  "page 76": "\"I\u0027m in,\" you and Joseph say in unison. \n\n\n\"Alright. The rules are simple. You need to remain loyal and remain quiet about this. That\u0027s it.\"\n\n\n\"How many are in the brotherhood?\"\n\n\n\"Mum\u0027s the word on that one. Understand, we\u0027re not telling you much here. You\u0027re new blood. This is only to test the waters. Soon, you\u0027ll learn more,\" Seamus says.\n\n\n\"You need to swear them in,\" Dougal says. \n\n\n\"Alright. You need to make the oath. Understood?\" Seamus says, as you and Joseph nod. \"Repeat after me. In the presence of God, I, so and so McCarthy, do solemnly swear that I will do my utmost to establish the independence of Ireland, and that I will bear true allegiance to the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Government of the Irish Republic and implicitly obey the constitution of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and all my superior officers and that I will preserve inviolable the secrets of the organization.\"\n\n\n\"Alright,\" you say, nodding. \"In the presence of God, I, Michael McCarthy, do solemnly swear that I will do my utmost to establish the independence of Ireland, and that I will bear true allegiance to the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Government of the Irish Republic and implicitly obey the constitution of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and all my superior officers and that I will preserve inviolable the secrets of the organization.\"\n\n\nJoseph says the oath for himself and by the end Seamus\u0027 grin has widened.\n\n\n\"Terrific boys. Erin go bragh!\"\n\n\n\"Erin go bragh,\" you all answer.\n\n\nYou share a glance with Joseph, and for a moment you feel like little kids playing dress up, in over their heads. Then, there\u0027s a cheer from the table, and you\u0027re there smiling again. Now, you\u0027re in the Irish Republican Brotherhood.\n",
  "page 79": "Over the next year, a lot changes. The Great War escalates as the Turkey Campaign goes badly, and war seems to have changed. With the use of planes, tanks, poison gas and the machine gun, reports convey a hell unlike anything known to man before. The warfare has turned to slow, brutal trench warfare where every foot of land is bought with the lives of men. You don\u0027t envy those men, forced to slog through such a miserable experience fighting for the king and queen that have labeled them as disposable pawns to be tossed away in a horrifying war.\n\n\nMeanwhile in Ireland, rebellion is becoming increasingly likely. With the fear of conscription looming on you all, there\u0027s a strong demand for the Irish Volunteers to stand up against this. Still, the failure of the Irish Parliamentary Party to secure home rule despite the now several year old Home Rule Act has meant that there\u0027s been increasing support for nationalism amongst the younger generations who see that their culture, their language, their people are being systematically wiped out by the work of the British Empire. Through the rumors coming along the line from the IRB members, it seems the military council that commands the IRB is pushing for an armed rebellion. Both you and Joseph are ready and willing to rise up when the time comes.\n\n\nIn other news for the IRB, the military council had a recent member joining: Darragh Connolly, the famous Socialist who lead the Irish Citizen Army in pushing for the rights of the worker in breaking free from the brutal exploitation of the lower and middle class by the rich and powerful. In inviting him to join, the IRB have secured that the Irish Citizen Army will stand alongside them when the time for violence comes.\n\n\nYou stroll along the street, the sun setting on the horizon as you lower the brim of your hat. You soon find yourself at the house where the meeting\u0027s taking place between the local IRB members to brief them on the current situation. \n\n\nYou walk inside, where the others await. They stare up at you, motioning for you to take a seat. You nod in response, pulling out your seat and sitting down. \n\n\n\"What needs to be discussed?\" you ask. \"What\u0027s new?\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s new, he asks,\" one of the men, Sean, responds. \"Other than the fact the Crown\u0027s got their foot on our throat and the British are ready to send us out to be carved up to keep their empire intact.\n\n\n\"He asked what was new, not what\u0027s been happening for centuries,\" Joseph says, as the group chuckles.\n\n\nAdmittedly, as much as you sympathize with the group\u0027s cause, they do constantly complain. Never the less, you get through it.\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s Finchy?\" you ask, referring to your almost always late IRB Comrade.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s not here yet. It doesn\u0027t matter, we can start without him,\" Seamus says. \"The plan\u0027s continued. We need to strike quick and hard, while Britain\u0027s weak in the war. The Rising\u0027s been moved to Easter, this year of 1916.\"\n\n\n\"Do we have the arms and men for it?\" you ask. \"Do we even have the support of the Irish Volunteers? I thought Eoin MacNeill wanted to avoid conflict.\"\n\n\n\"He does, unless necessary. Unfortunately, he doesn\u0027t seem to buy that it\u0027s necessary. We\u0027ve had our top forger make up a document, however. It\u0027s called the Castle Document. It calls for the imprisonment of all leaders of the Irish Volunteers and the dissolving of the Volunteers as a whole. We\u0027ve already faked a raid on Dublin Castle to obtain it. With it, we\u0027re going to convince Eoin that we need to fight, as he\u0027ll think the British have planned to arrest him and destroy everything he\u0027s built.\"\n\n\n\"So... we have a document we made to look like it\u0027s from the British? Are we sure it\u0027ll work?\"\n\n\n\"Relatively,\" Seamus nods. \"It\u0027s a good forgery. That\u0027ll give us the volunteers.\"\n\n\n\"Even then, is it enough?\" another volunteer, Rory O\u0027Connor, asks.\n\n\n\"We also have an ally. Sir Roger Casement,\" Seamus says.\n\n\nYou pause, as there\u0027s a hush of whispers. You know that name. Roger Casement was a humanitarian. He worked in far off, distant countries like the Congo and Peru, helping the poor negroes who were being abused by the British in power there, just like you Irish were. However, he was knighted by the King for doing so. The British King, King George V. \n\n\n\"He\u0027s recognized the plight of the downtrodden here, just as he saw it in Peru, and the Congo. He\u0027s been to Germany. They\u0027re desperate to end the war, and they think we\u0027ll help draw British attention away. They\u0027re releasing all Irish POWs willing to fight, as well as gifting us with rifles, 20,000 of them, and ten machine guns. This force is going to sneak here via submarine, and join us. Then, with their help, we take Dublin.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s brave,\" an IRB comrade remarks. \"We might well do it.\"\n\n\n\"We will do it, and we\u0027ll succeed,\" Seamus says. \"Now, you\u0027ll be organizing the distribution of the rifles among our forces.\"\n\n\n\"Aye,\" the comrade nods.\n\n\n\"Rory, you\u0027re to escort the Castle Document, meet with Roger Casement. You know him, you\u0027ll be able to convince him.\"\n\n\n\"Got it,\" Rory O\u0027Connor nods.\n\n\n\"McCarthy brothers, we have two possible roles for you. The first is to escort the Castle Document and our IRB comrade to Eoin MacNeill. If you must, you are to give your lives to ensure it gets where it\u0027s going. The second is to rendezvous with another car to meet with Roger Casement and our German allies. Then, you lead them to the safe-house we\u0027ve set up for it. As Finchy didn\u0027t show up yet, the choice is yours.\"\n",

Mary was always a smart one. Perhaps she\u0027s right. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time she outsmarted her two brothers. Maybe this is a lost cause. You can\u0027t imagine letting Joseph get killed fighting, but then again, you can\u0027t imagine living under the heel of the British. You don\u0027t know. You don\u0027t want violence to happen. But if the British try to stop you marching, protesting, arguing, simply speaking for your rights, you\u0027ll have to. Ah, the sacrifices you make for Ireland.\n\n\nYou take a deep breath, raising your head before blowing air through your teeth. You pause, seeing Joseph standing. He stands in front of you, his rifle resting in his hands, clad in his Volunteer uniform.\n\n\n\"Joseph?\" you ask quizzically.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s going on?\" you ask. \"The march was yesterday, and even that was cancelled. Why do you even have your rifle at home? No one\u0027s marching.\"\n\n\n\"The volunteers might not be, but I am. I\u0027m serving the cause no matter what.\"  \n\n\n\"Joseph,\" you say slowly, standing. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\"I need to go. I don\u0027t have time to explain,\" he says.\n\n\nJoseph goes to push past you, before you pause, realizing what\u0027s going on.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re going to try takeover,\" you say suddenly.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re all going, Michael! The Irish Republican Brotherhood has chosen to strike, to force the boot off our throat and to free Ireland.

  "page 71": "You wander over to Countess Markievicz, who stands surrounded by men. For a woman nearing her fifties, she looks well. Certainly not attractive, but well. \n\n\nThe wife of a Polack Count and daughter of a land baron, the Countess is the kind of woman who\u0027d normally scorn the poor volunteers like you. She joined the Irish Citizen Army, donating all of her wealth to either funding soup kitchens, funding the ICA\u0027s strike for worker writings during the Great Lock-Out of 1913 and even designed the ICA uniform and anthem. Perhaps the best way to describe her is with advice she gave out to Irish women, with the line \"Dress suitably in short skirts and strong boots, leave your jewels in the bank and buy a revolver.\" \n\n\nShe stands in full uniform, her hat pulled low and her green uniform making her look more like a man than a woman.

I want Ireland to be free, but I don\u0027t want to see men be sent to the slaughter by Butcher MacNeil!\"\n\n\n\"Eoin MacNeil is willing to die for the cause!\"\n\n\n\"Eoin MacNeil isn\u0027t going to die for the cause! It\u0027s idiots like Joseph with their hearts so full of ideals that they can\u0027t listen to their head who die for the cause, and I don\u0027t want to see that!\"\n\n\n\"To get what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Milk and eggs!\" Mary says angrily, heading out of the room.\n\n\n\"We live on a fucking farm with three hens and a cow!\" you shout after her, before the door slams shut. \"Bollocks.\"\n\n\nYou slam your head against the table, trying to think. Mary was always a smart one. Perhaps she\u0027s right. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time she outsmarted her two brothers. Maybe this is a lost cause. You can\u0027t imagine letting Joseph get killed fighting, but then again, you can\u0027t imagine living under the heel of the British. You don\u0027t know. You don\u0027t want violence to happen. But if the British try to stop you marching, protesting, arguing, simply speaking for your rights, you\u0027ll have to. Ah, the sacrifices you make for Ireland.\n\n\nYou take a deep breath, raising your head before blowing air through your teeth. You pause, seeing Joseph standing. He stands in front of you, his rifle resting in his hands, clad in his Volunteer uniform.\n\n\n\"Joseph?\" you ask quizzically.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s going on?\" you ask. \"The march was yesterday, and even that was cancelled. Why do you even have your rifle at home? No one\u0027s marching.\"\n\n\n\"The volunteers might not be, but I am. I\u0027m serving the cause no matter what.\"  \n\n\n\"Joseph,\" you say slowly, standing. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\"I need to go. I don\u0027t have time to explain,\" he says.\n\n\nJoseph goes to push past you, before you pause, realizing what\u0027s going on.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re going to try takeover,\" you say suddenly.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re all going, Michael! The Irish Republican Brotherhood has chosen to strike, to force the boot off our throat and to free Ireland. MacNeil and the rest of the volunteers might not be willing to, but I am, and I\u0027m not going to cower at a moment like this.\"\n\n\n\"Joseph, it\u0027s suicide. I can\u0027t let you go get killed for them!\"\n\n\nJoseph looks at you sternly, and you\u0027re certain he won\u0027t be talked down.\n",

Are you willing to give your life for the cause?\"\n\n\n\"Of course,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Terrific! Off we go, then!\" Dougal says.\n\n\nYou follow Dougal down to the pub, the Thatch House. You walk inside, to find a small group of green-clad men in Irish Volunteer garb, sitting in a booth as a bartender puts a tray of pints down on the table. Dougal leads you to the table, sitting down.\n\n\n\"Erin go braugh,\" Dougal says.\n\n\n\"Erin go braugh,\" the men respond.\n\n\nOne of the men, a massive bearded man with bright green eyes, looks at you, before staring at Dougal.\n\n\n\"Which one\u0027s Joseph?\" he asks in a gruff tone.\n\n\n\"I am,\" Joseph says. \n\n\n\"Who the fuck are you, then?\" the bearded man asks you. \n\n\n\"An Irish lad who\u0027s going to break someone nose if people don\u0027t stop shitting on him,\" you reply, as the bearded man grins.\n\n\n\"Good answer. What are you drinking?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll take a pint of Guinness.\"\n\n\n\"Jerry!\" the bearded man booms. \"A pint of Guinness, please.\"\n\n\nYou all sit down at the table, as you exchange glances with Joseph.\n\n\n\"So,\" the bearded man says. \"I thought you were only watching Joseph. Where\u0027d the other lad come in?\"\n\n\n\"This is Michael McCarthy, Joseph\u0027s brother. The two are joined at the hip, you can\u0027t watch one without watching the other,\" Dougal responds.\n\n\n\"Right then, lads,\" the bearded man nods. \"The name\u0027s Seamus. I have a single question for you. Are you willing to die for a united Ireland? Are you willing to...?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve asked them,\" Dougal says.\n\n\n\"What\u0027d they say?\" Seamus asks.\n\n\n\"They said fuck the Irish, kill the gingers, pints are shit and God save the King. What the fuck do you think they said, Seamus?\"\n\n\n\"Fair point,\" Seamus nods. \"Do you boys know who we are?\"\n\n\n\"Enlighten us,\" you respond.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re the IRB. The Irish Republican Brotherhood. We stand for a full Irish republic. Not just a parliament, but complete freedom. We don\u0027t want to just be slaves with less rules. We want to be free!\"\n\n\nJoseph nods vigorously, as you listen.\n\n\n\"No kings. No kaiser. A president, voted by the Irish people. Voted by you and me. Not the rich protestants, not the fuckers in London, but the Irish people! Dougal\u0027s been watching you for the past year. We want you to join us. I need to know. Are you in, or are you out?\"\n",

After some time, it becomes clear you\u0027re lacking in both weapons and men. Fortunately, you and Joseph are sent to to County Louth to remedy that solution, and to assist in the operations of the IRA there. Dundalk is the home of a large Free State barracks and prison. There\u0027s a large stockpile of guns, as well as hundreds of IRA prisoners being held there for opposing that bloody Treaty through the only way they know how. It\u0027s almost too ideal a target, and should solve both of your biggest issues.\n\n\nDue to your experience, you\u0027re appointed as the lieutenant of the anti-Treaty IRA commander by the name of Frank Aiken, a well-known and daring commander who has fought well, especially for someone so unsure of his position on the treaty.

The group assembles into formation, and you and Joseph are among the first intruders in, planting a pair of old captured mines on the barracks wall so you can break in, quickly heading to capture the prisoners and arms. \n\n\nAfter a short journey of frog-marching through the hills, you reach the barracks, and escort your soldiers ahead as you quickly ahead before any sentries catch you.

There\u0027s a stand off between O\u0027Malley and 800 of his anti-treaty IRA and 700 pro-Treaty IRA men under Michael Brennan over who will take over the military barracks in Cork after British soldiers abandoned it, which ends peacefully, thankfully, after the barracks is divided between pro-treaty and anti-treaty forces. Later in Cork, IRA soldiers raise a British ship, taking 1500 rifles, 700 handguns and 60 machine guns. \n\n\nThen, comes a more definitive attack on your Free State. Led by Cathal Brugha and Rory O\u0027Connor, your old friend, 200 anti-treaty IRA soldiers take over the Four Courts, the center of judicial power in Dublin, in order to show defiance and to provoke a response from the British soldiers in Dublin, hoping that if Britain\u0027s provoked, the Irish will be able to team up again in repelling them and the war can continue. You\u0027re positioned outside the Four Courts, ready to defend the Free State if these traitors make an attack.\n\n\nIn May, anti-Treaty soldiers take over the center of Kilkenny, before being dislodged by 200 Free State soldiers.

The election takes place, with pro-Treaty parties far outdoing anti-treaty parties. Sir Henry Hughes Wilson is assassinated in Britain, although whether it\u0027s by anti-Treaty IRA soldiers or a secret assassination by Michael Collins and the Free State is debated, due to Sir Hughes Wilson being an almost universally hated figure among Irish for his treatment of Irish citizens in the war.

The police are withdrawn from the street, and the rebels have seized the city.\n\n\nYou stand inside the GPO, with the Irish Volunteers Director of Arms walking alongside you as you lead him to a recently captured British soldier. The man, known mainly as The O\u0027Rahilly, wasn\u0027t a member of the IRB, and thus wasn\u0027t told about the Rising until a day later. He drove here in his motorcar, showing him with a grin and a fervor to do his patriotic duty.\n\n\n\"Did you really need to come here?\" one of the other soldiers escorting them says. \"You didn\u0027t support an armed action, did you?\"\n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ve helped to wind up the clock -- I might as well hear it strike!\" he says, grinning. \"I\u0027ll do my duty to this new republic happily.\"\n\n\nHe\u0027s quickly led to the British soldier, who is tied up in telephone wire in a telephone box.

Food, water? I\u0027m really sorry about this whole situation, but you know how armed combat is. Hopefully, we can be gentlemen about this.\"\n\n\nThe O\u0027Rahilly turns to the soldier to his left, nodding vigorously.\n\n\n\"I want this officer to watch the safe to see that nothing is touched. You will see that no harm comes to him.\"\n\n\nThe soldier nods, as the O\u0027Rahilly turns to you.\n\n\n\"Alright, thanks for showing me the way. Go return to your post, soldier, a pleasure meeting you. What did you say your name was?\"\n\n\n\"Michael, sir. Michael McCarthy,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Pleasure to meet you, Michael,\" he says, shaking your hand. \"God bless you and your service.\"\n\n\nYou nod, before you begin walking down back to the streets, as you hurry to a nearby barricade set up in the streets to repel a British attack. You take your post there, lined up with Joseph and a few other soldiers.\n\n\nOver the next few hours, you\u0027re left guarding there, with no attacks. As you\u0027re the headquarters in the center of the Rebel-controlled territory, the British aren\u0027t able to directly attack.\n\n\nAfter a few hours, late in the evening, you\u0027re left smoking a cigarette, staring out across the barricade of chairs, barrels and bricks tossed haphazardly into a wall. Joseph walks back and forth, clearly bored.\n\n\n\"God, this freedom fighting can get boring, can\u0027t it?\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"Shut up and do your duty, you dopey fool!\" Liam, another soldier, shouts from across the duty, as there\u0027s a few laughs.\n\n\n\"Jesus, Liam, that\u0027s not what your...!\" Joseph replies with a laugh,\n\n\n\"Shut up!\" you say suddenly, pausing as you hear a faint whistling in the air. \"Shit, get...!\"\n\n\nThe ground explodes, as an explosive shell smashes into the barricade, exploding it in a shower of shrapnel. You\u0027re docked off your feet, sent flying through the air as you smack into the ground. Shells begin slamming into the barricade, the street and the room around you, as explosions tear through the city. There\u0027s a terrified scream, as a Volunteer is showered with wooden shrapnel from a destroyed table, killing him instantly. Another shell hits a man directly, setting him off in a red mist of gore.\n\n\n\"Fuck, shelling!\" someone screams.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s going on?!\" you yell.\n\n\n\"The British have sailed a gunboat up the River Liffey!\" someone yells.\n\n\nYou swear, keeping low as you wonder what to do. \n",
  "page 115": "You walk through the near empty streets of Dublin, strolling along the River Liffey. All around you are the destroyed wreckages of buildings devastated. Rubble fills the street, forcing you to walk over the chunks of rebar and concrete that fill the street. Bullet holes are thudded into the wall of a building, and you slowly run your fingers along them, peering inside at the pieces of metal still within.\n\n\n\"The machine guns did a number on these places,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"They could\u0027ve done a number on you,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"For God\u0027s sake, Michael, can you leave off it? I was trying to do what I could. I couldn\u0027t take the order to fight today. Next time, I\u0027m going to. This is only the beginning.\"\n\n\nYou continue to walk, staring around at the wreckage. You walk past the destroyed remains of a barricade, the shining, broken remainders of bayonets lying on the ground, from what must\u0027ve been a serious last charge. \n\n\nThe casualties of war are gone, their bodies dragged off for burial, but the blood still remains to show you how brutal the fighting was. A long smear runs across the road, where a dying man was dragged or tried to crawl away. The larger pool of dried blood tells you that he probably didn\u0027t make it. \n\n\n\"Hundreds lost in a week. So many souls lost,\" you whisper.\n\n\n\"They\u0027ll be remembered,\" Joseph says firmly.\n\n\nAlmost immediately, however, life seems to have gone. You watch as a woman pushes a stroller through the streets, narrowly avoiding debris as she coos at her baby. An old couple walks hand in hand down the street, admiring the river as if oblivious to the destruction around them. It\u0027s almost impressive how quickly the Irish people have bounced back.\n\n\nYou continue walking down the street, before you see them. The British have cordoned off a section of the road, and now they\u0027re escorting captured Volunteers down it. You watch as they try to round up the men and escort them down the road towards the trucks that can\u0027t drive through the rubble filled streets.\n\n\nYou look to see if you can recognize anyone from the crowd, but you can\u0027t, attempting to the prisoners.\n\n\n\"Heroes, the lot of them,\" Joseph says. \"I shoul...\"\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t fucking say it,\" you snarl.\n\n\nJoseph nods, before waving as the prisoners pass.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t wave at the prisoners!\" a British soldier barks.\n",

However, it\u0027s too little too late, as the Irish people already wants full independence now, and home rule clearly isn\u0027t enough. \n\n\nIn order to help deal with the Irish dilemma, the Englishmen begin recruiting vast quantities of English veterans from the Great War.

In retaliation for losing men to IRA attacks, they burn down towns, beat up civilians, rob businesses, shooting innocent people and executing prisoners.

  "page 238": "Over the next few months, the British government puts forward the Government of Ireland Act 1920, where three of the four Irish provinces, Munster, Leinster and Connaught, all combine into an entity gaining it\u0027s own \"Southern Parliament\" while the Northmost Ulster remains under the British parliament, and Southern Ireland gains home rule. However, it\u0027s too little too late, as the Irish people already wants full independence now, and home rule clearly isn\u0027t enough. \n\n\nIn order to help deal with the Irish dilemma, the Englishmen begin recruiting vast quantities of English veterans from the Great War. Due to their expertise in fighting they\u0027re perfect for waging war on the IRA, but due to the fact that they\u0027re not soldiers and are hired as police men, the British can continue to pretend like they\u0027re not at war with Ireland and that they\u0027re simply putting down a wave of crime and terrorism. As they wear a mixture of tan military uniforms and black police uniforms, these men are known as the Black and Tans.\n\n\nThe Black and Tans are brutal in their oppression of the Irish people. A lack of discipline allows them to perform endless atrocities. In retaliation for losing men to IRA attacks, they burn down towns, beat up civilians, rob businesses, shooting innocent people and executing prisoners. Of course, this oppression fails to break the spirit of the Irish people. Instead, it forces the Irish people to pick sides, and they almost all side with the less brutal IRA. A wave of nationalism surges through the country, and it becomes clear peace is impossible. No, the path forward is one of war and bloodshed.\n\n\nYou walk down the busy streets of Dublin, a cigarette hanging in the corner of your mouth. You hold a bag of bottled apple juice for Ma, her favorite, as well as quite a few other bits and bobs for the house. You hurry down the road, quickly trying to reach home before sunrise.\n\n\n\"Shut your fucking mouth!\" a voice screams. \"You fucking Irish cunt, I will blow your husbands head off and make you tongue the neck-hole!\" \n\n\n\"Jesus,\" you mutter, turning to see what the dilemma is.\n\n\nA young man lies on the street corner, covered in blood. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s been heavily beaten by the bruising covering his face. A woman is being held against the wall by a Black and Tans\u0027 fist, as three others stand over the man. \n\n\n\"Stay the fuck back!\" one of the Black and Tans says, raising his rifle to aim it at your chest. \n\n\nYou quickly raise your hands in a gesture of surrender, stepping back.\n\n\n\"Relax, I\u0027m not trying to start anything,\" you say. \"I served in the Great War the same as you, I\u0027m a veteran.\" \n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t ask for your fucking story, paddy. What do you want?\"\n\n\n\"This man is a traitor to the Empire!\" the Black and Tan explains. \"He proclaimed we were \"invaders\", the fucking pig farmer. I\u0027m so sick of this fucking civil war, I\u0027m not showing mercy to any fucking supporters of the enemy.\"\n\n\n\"You called it a civil war,\" you remark. \"Haven\u0027t the British argued that they\u0027re only putting down terrorists?\"\n\n\n\"Watch it, paddy,\" the Black and Tan says, glaring at you. \"Don\u0027t get smart with me.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s not a crime, is it?\" you ask.\n\n\nThe Black and Tan spits on the ground in front of you, snarling.\n\n\n\"It is if I go and fucking say it is, you understand? Best stroll on before it gets dark. We\u0027ll deal with this.\"\n\n\nFuckers. It\u0027s times like this you wish you\u0027d joined up with the IRA with Joseph. Still, that\u0027s the past. The only question now is whether you\u0027re going to stand up to these thugs.\n",
  "page 359": "You draw your pistol from your pocket, raising it through the air. You pull the trigger, a bullet flying through the air. It slashes past the face of one of the men, knocking him backwards as blood pours down his face.\n\n\n\"Fuck! IRA! Attack, attack!\" he screams, as the others dive behind the cover the burning building provides.\n\n\nYou look to Joseph, who draws his rifle as well. You hear a shout as a group of Black and Tans wielding rifles charge out from around the corner. You turn to see the soldiers charge for you, as the Black and Tans quickly outnumber you.\n\n\n\"Fuck it, we\u0027ve distracted them, at least,\" Joseph says. \"Let\u0027s get the fuck out of here.\" \n",
  "page 88": "You smash upon him with the pan, the pan smacking into the rifle as it knocks the gun barrel aside. You leap upon him, pinning his gun arm with your knee as you raise the pan into the air, smacking it down on him with a powerful smack. Joseph yelps, the pan cutting open his forehead and giving him a powerful wallop. You raise the pan again, smacking it into his hand as it raises to defend itself, knocking his hand aside.\n\n\nYou raise his hand repeatedly, smashing the pan into Joseph repeatedly, cutting open his skin and battering his flesh. You raise your pan again and again, smacking it into your brother. After about a minute of hits, the gun drops from Joseph\u0027s hands, clattering across the ground as he goes limp, battered and bruised, bleeding heavily. Your brother lets out a deep sob, as you let the pan slip from your hands.\n\n\n\"I need to fight, goddammit! I need to serve my country!\" \n\n\nYou grab Joseph\u0027s bleeding head, holding it tightly against your chest as he breaks down in sobbing.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Joseph. I can\u0027t let you die. I can\u0027t let you die,\" you say.\n\n\nThe two of you sit there, blood soaking through to your clothes, as you hold your brother tight, not willing to let him go.\n",
  "page 87": "Later that morning, the Irish rebels strike. You presume that Joseph is among them, and all you can do is hope he\u0027s OK. In Dublin city center, the area bounded by the Grand Canal and Royal Canal, the rebels make their attack, quickly splitting up to take several key positions in the city, such as the General Post Office, the Four Courts, St Stephen\u0027s Green, Dublin City Hall and South Dublin Union. Within the first day, the British forces had been crushed, with little actual fighting taking place. Padraig Pearse, the leader the of rising, even read a proclamation of the Irish republic, hoisting up a big old flag for the Republic.\n\n\nTuesday, the British sailed a gunship up the river Liffey, allowing them to have artillery support through the entire city. Their forces counter-attacked, striking through the city, with mixed success. Their was heavy shelling, and all you could do is hope that. Ma wept and prayed for Joseph\u0027s life, while Mary suggested searching the city to try bring him home, but you know shells don\u0027t ask your allegiance before going off.\n\n\nBy Wednesday, hundreds of British troops attacked twenty six volunteers in the Mendicity Institute, and they became the first of the rebels to surrender. Impressively, these men had been placed as a diversion to hold the area for a few hours to slow down the British, but had lasted three days. Meanwhile in the assault on Mount Street, seventeen Irish rebels managed to hold off over a thousand British soldiers, taking out 240 British soldiers with only 4 of their own casualties.\n\n\nOf course, after that, the British hit hard. Over the next few days, there was endless brutality, As the British forces push in, they take heavy losses, but do push the rebels back. Eventually, with the combined. Both a lack of numbers, and the high amount of unexpected civilian casualties, either those killed in the shelling, in the crossfire, or those executed in retaliation by the British, meant that the rebels lost their will to fight. \n\n\nOn Saturday, the rebels abandoned their headquarters in the GPO. Shortly after, to avoid further civilian causalities, the rebels officially surrendered, and the Rising drew to a close. 260 civilians lost their lives, although with 126 British soldiers, 82 rebels and 17 police officers. Hopefully, Joseph is among the majority that surrounded and was captured, rather than among the dead.\n",
  "page 119": "You sit in the kitchen, a cup of tea in your hand as always. Ma sits in her rocker as always, knitting. Mary sits next to you, her eyes scanning the casualty lists for anyone she knew. Joseph sits in the corner, despondent and broken-hearted.\n\n\nIt truly is a heart-warming scene.\n\n\nThankfully, the fighting was far too far away, in the main city rather than out here in the countryside, to have had any effect on you other than a lack of post and the farmer\u0027s market being closed. You\u0027re left sitting there, wondering what\u0027s going on in the city.\n\n\nYou take a swig of the tea, staring around. \n",
  "page 89": "You drop the pan, as it clatters to the ground. You sigh, looking at the ground in disappointment, as Joseph keeps the rifle aimed at your chest.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Michael, I don\u0027t want to do this,\" Joseph says, the gun barrel pressed to your chest. \"But I need to go.\"\n\n\nJoseph slowly moves towards the door, the gun still pointed at you.

Tell Ma and Mary I love them dearly.\"\n\n\nYou reach out to Joseph, to try talk to him, to try to convince him to stay, but he strolls out the door, his stride firm, his eyes downcast. He heads out the door, off to fight the unwinnable war against an Empire.\n\n\nYou collapse back into the kitchen chair, disgusted in yourself. You lean your head back, screaming at the ceiling at the top of your very lungs.\n\n\n\"FUCK!\" you scream angrily.\n\n\nThis isn\u0027t how it should be. Your brother\u0027s throwing away his life after a lost cause. Now, he\u0027ll die, shot in the street or hung like a dog, and there\u0027s ultimately nothing you can do about it. All that\u0027s left to do is to drown your sorrows.\n\n\nYou stare over at the cabinet, standing. You trudge over, pulling the cabinet door open as you pull out a bottle of fine, expensive Irish whiskey. Or more accurately, Irish whiskey. You grab a clay mug, pulling it from the cabinet and laying it on the table. You slowly twist off the bottle\u0027s cork, pulling it off to get a scent of the toxic cure inside. You slowly pour the mug, about half full with the liquid, before lifting it, pressing the brim of the mug to your lips.\n\n\n\"For Eireann,\" you say, downing the mug of burning liquid. \n",

Snarling, he immediately begins sizing up to you. He\u0027s far stronger and bulkier, but you\u0027re taller, so that might help, you suppose. Of course, he\u0027s holding a rifle in his hands, so you\u0027re not entirely sure how this will go.\n\n\n\"Michael, don\u0027t make me put fists on you. Because I will. I promise you, I don\u0027t want to, but I\u0027ll do whatever I have to for the good of Ireland.\"\n\n\nYou stand firm, looking Michael dead in the eye, staring into his eyes.

Your fist connects with his jaw, as he smashes backwards, collapsing onto his ass with a pained grunt, his rifle flying out of his hands.\n\n\nYou look frantically around, spotting an old iron pan left out from yesterday\u0027s cooking that could make a hefty club, and Joseph\u0027s rifle clattering along the ground. Of course, you could also take this to the ground, tackling Joseph to the ground.\n",
  "page 84": "You charge forward, diving down to the ground and wrapping your fingers around the rifle. However, Joseph is as fast, grabbing the rifle from you, almost ripping it from your hands. You tighten your grip on the rifle, as the two of you wrestle over it. Joseph tears himself to his feet, as the two of you struggle brutally over the rifle, smacking into the table.\n\n\n\"Let go! Let fucking go!\" Joseph yells.\n\n\nJoseph slams the rifle against you, smacking you against the floor. The rifle goes off with a bang, as you\u0027re slammed against the wall. You slowly skid down, leaving a large trail of blood going down the wall, groaning as blood begins to pour from the bullet whole in the center of your chest.\n\n\n\"MICHAEL!\" Joseph screams, tossing his rifle aside. \"Michael, you stupid son of a bitch! I\u0027m so sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to. I swear to God, I didn\u0027t mean to. Don\u0027t worry, don\u0027t worry.\"\n\n\nYou try to talk, but your entire chest is rapidly growing cold and numb, as the warm blood running down your chest feels ice cold. Your clothes are quickly soaked through with blood, your shirt sticking to your chest as it\u0027s stained crimson red. Joseph presses his hands against your chest in an attempt to stem the tide of blood pouring down your chest, but the blood just keeps gushing out. Your mouth opens and closes, as you try to tell Joseph it\u0027s not his fault, but no noise comes out.\n\n\n\"Michael! I\u0027m so sorry, please Michael, don\u0027t die, don\u0027t die,\" Joseph pleads, his voice growing fainter and fainter.\n\n\nThat\u0027s the last things you hear, as the world grows dark. \n",
  "page 83": "You march with Joseph, rifle in hand, down the empty streets of early morn. It\u0027s not long before you reach a huge amassing of people from the Irish Volunteers, the female branch Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army. Joseph quickly leads you to one of the men trying to organize this whole affair.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ve met,\" the man says.\n\n\n\"This is Michael. He\u0027s a volunteer, and my brother.\"\n\n\n\"Seamus,\" the man says, shaking your hand.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m here to fight,\" you say, determined.\n\n\n\"The Volunteers didn\u0027t come today. It\u0027s the Irish Republican Brotherhood here,\" Seamus says.\n\n\n\"We were supposed to be here. Can\u0027t you use the men?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I can use a few men. Join in with Joseph\u0027s squad. I don\u0027t have time to organize the men into groups,\" Seamus says. \"You\u0027ll be taking the General Post Office with the main force. Do you have ammo?\"\n\n\n\"I do,\" you nod eagerly.\n\n\n\"Good. You\u0027ll need it,\" he says. \"Best of luck, boy.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re handed a black brimmer hat, as well as a yellow Volunteer armband and a bandolier. You\u0027re also handed a spare grenade, which you slide into your satchel. The groups break away, splitting off into the various designated group.\n\n\nThe plan is simple. Take Dublin City Centre. There\u0027s a large, oval-shaped area between the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, with the River Liffy running through the middle. You\u0027re to set up, barricade and prepare to force back any British assaults until... well, that seems to be the unanswered question on everyone\u0027s mind.\n\n\nYou\u0027re left with the largest group, made up of 400 Irish Volunteers and men of the Irish Citizen Army. You watch as the leaders of this group assemble in front of you, standing up on some old city steps as they stare at their group.\n\n\nTom Clarke, an elderly, bespectacled man with a thick gray mustache stands on the far left. The man\u0027s been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood for 38 years, and despite his age, the man\u0027s possibly the most powerful man in the IRB.\n\n\nTo Clarke\u0027s right is Seán Mac Diarmada. The man beams at the men assembled before him, an ecstatic look on his face. He nods to those around him. He leans heavily on a cane, which at his young age can only be from a bout of polio. As one of the most prominent promoters of the Irish language and culture, as well as a national organizer for Sinn Féin and the manager of the Irish Freedom newspaper, he\u0027s well known by everyone there.\n\n\nNext is Joseph Mary Plunkett. The young, timid, bespectacled man is an affluent poet, although his loyalty to the cause is well known. Plunkett was the man who traveled secretly to Germany, making plans with Roger Casement and the German government to secure arms and POWs. Although his plans have gone up in flames due to Casement\u0027s capture, the man seems more unnerved by the attention than the actual idea of fighting. You know his family, despite being more than rich enough to turn their head at the plight of the common man, have pledged their loyalty to the cause, with two of his brothers fighting today and his father having turned some of his property into a training camp for IRB soldiers.\n\n\nNext is Pádraig Pearse, who stands proud and determined. He\u0027s the most powerful figure in the Volunteers here, which for a school teacher is impressive. The man\u0027s been the mastermind of the entire Easter Rising, and seems to look out at the crowd with a fierce spirit. His brother, Willie Pearse, is also fighting today. There\u0027s not a man in the crowd who isn\u0027t familiar with Pearse\u0027s contributions to the cause of Irish nationalism.\n\n\nFinally, there\u0027s James Connolly, the commander of this unit. He\u0027s a middle-aged, balding man with a great thick mustache, who almost seems unassuming. However, as an ex-British soldier, a militant socialist who founded the Irish Citizen Army and fought hard for the rights of the downtrodden and the poor, he\u0027s a hero to the common man. As a huge supporter of the rights of women, saying \"the female is the slave of the slave\", he\u0027s even gotten quite a great deal of support from the women here, noted when they cheer the loudest as he steps forward.\n\n\nYour attention temporarily switches to the women of Cumann na mBan, the woman\u0027s equivalent of the Irish volunteers. They\u0027ve come today to help with the organization of the rebellion, to work as couriers, medics and procure arms and rations.\n\n\nOf course, not all of them are so content to \"help out\" in the rising. The Irish Citizen Army allows female soldiers, and there\u0027s a few there, armed with rifles. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! Would you be so kind as to give me a moment\u0027s attention?\" James Connolly booms.\n\n\nImmediately, over 400 people go silent, staring at the figure in front of them. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re here today for one reason: freedom! The Irish people have been stepped on, downtrodden, and abused for centuries. The British will not give us our language, they will not give us our culture, they will not give us our parliament. Thus, we are here today to take what is rightfully ours.\"\n\n\nJames Connolly pauses for a moment, surveying the crowd.\n\n\n\"The Irish cause is one dear to my heart. It\u0027s dear to all of our hearts. Together, we have a duty to do what\u0027s best for the nation of Ireland. We do not fight for ourselves, but for our children, and our children\u0027s children. Every Irish child, here and abroad, will remember the tale of the men who fought today, for freedom, for independence, for Eireann!\"\n\n\nJames Connolly sticks his chin up, looking proudly at the group.\n\n\n\"Now, we don\u0027t have a moment to waste. All across the city, our forces prepare for the takeover. Let\u0027s do our part, and secure the GPO for the Irish Republic!\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a reply of thunderous applause, before you quickly take up marching. It\u0027s not long before you reach the GPO, marching quickly up the steps of it as you take the people simply going to the post by surprise and send them hurrying to their homes.\n\n\n\"Come on, inside!\" Connolly yells.\n",

It\u0027s going to be a hard fight to win this battle and push them back out of the city. \n\n\nNow, on Thursday, a British force of soldiers have pushed up an advance force to the GPO, and you\u0027re forced to defend it. With a handful of other soldiers, James Connolly included, you\u0027re left defending an upper floor.\n\n\nYou stand by the window of the GPO, rushing to reload rifles. The single-shot nature of your rifles means you\u0027ve set it up so while two men reload\n\n\n\"Christ, I need a better stance,\" Connolly says, putting his foot up on the windowsill. \n\n\nJames Connolly aims down his rifle, taking another shot. Suddenly, a bullet thuds into his leg, as he\u0027s sent toppling over with a scream. He lies on the ground, clutching his heavily bleeding leg. You drop the rifle you\u0027re holding, looking around for something to do. You can\u0027t see outside, but you know it\u0027s not going to take much to overrun your position.\n",
  "page 360": "You move along the streets, quickly moving through the streets as you wonder what\u0027s going on. Dozens of buildings are up in flames, as various RIC and Black and Tans looting and committing mass arson. Huge sections of the city are up in flames, as homes are destroyed.\n\n\nIt\u0027s not long before you reach the fire brigade, at the center of the city outside the burning Cork City Hall and Carnegie Library. Surprisingly, however, they\u0027re not attempting to put out the fire. Instead, they\u0027re crouching low behind a fire truck. However\n\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" you ask, rushing over to the fire fighters. \n\n\nA bullet pings near you, bouncing off the ground, as you scamper to hide behind the truck. You turn, looking at them, rushing near an ash-covered man with a thick mustache. He looks at you, scampering over.\n\n\n\"You need to get out of here! This whole place is dangerous!\" he barks.\n\n\n\"What the fuck\u0027s going on? Why are you pinned down here?\"\n\n\n\"Black and Tans took over the city hall and are burning it down from the inside. However, they\u0027ve slashed our hoses so we can\u0027t use them, and left a few men by the city hall window to take potshots at us in case we keep trying to put out the fires.\"\n\n\n\"The Black and Tans are sabotaging firefighting attempts? Those fucking bastards,\" Joseph says. \"This is why we need to fight, Michael.\"\n\n\n\"Fight?\" the firefighter says, scowling. \"Look around you. The second largest city in the country is being burned to the fucking ground because of this war. We were content before 1916. We had peace. Death, and this is all you bastards brought us!\"  \n\n\n\"We\u0027re trying to help!\" you say. \"We...!\"\n\n\n\"Can it. I\u0027m in no mood to argue politics. I\u0027m trying to save as much as this city as I can.\" \n\n\nYou step back, still crouched behind the fire truck with Joseph.\n\n\n\"We need to help some way, don\u0027t we?\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"What can we even do?\" you ask.\n",
  "page 481": "You turn, bursting towards the nearest building as shells land around you, rushing inside a building as your comrades do the same. You shoulder open the door, finding you\u0027re in an office building, no doubt one that was abandoned when the fighting started. You\u0027re left waiting there inside, hoping that the violence ends soon as shells explode outside.\n\n\nThe shelling continues until nightfall, as the sky darkens on the second day of the newly proclaimed Republic. As the shelling ends, you\u0027re left clutching at your rifle, praying to God it doesn\u0027t start up again, as tiles from the roof drop down, breaking open with crashes around you. For the next few minutes, or hours, perhaps, you\u0027re just left desperately hoping it doesn\u0027t start again, terrified out of your mind. Your allies are equally terrified. You\u0027re not soldiers; you\u0027re children, sent out to take back your country from an impossibly large Empire. \n\n\n\"God our father, almighty Jesus, Holy Spirit, please grant me the strength and power to last through the nigh.t Please help me break away from the...\" you begin to mutter, before Joseph angrily grasps your arm.\n\n\n\"They can\u0027t take away our fighting spirit that easily!\" Joseph says desperately. \"They just can\u0027t! It\u0027s not fair!\"\n\n\n\"Joseph, just quiet down. No one wants to hear you breaking the silence. They\u0027re content in it. Just leave them appreciate the fact that shells aren\u0027t raising now.\"\n\n\nJoseph falls silent, but this time, the silence isn\u0027t as still. You can hear whimpering from the other buildings, crying from the wounded and the scared, desperate muttered prayers from the others. You close your eyes, desperately hoping for a way out. Joseph looks around, seeing the same group of terrified boys hiding that you see. He closes his eyes tightly, before opening them with a fierce look of determination. Slowly, he begins to sing one of the new Irish patriot tunes, his voice rising above the terrified mutterings of the rest of the pour souls hiding out there.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll sing a song, a soldier\u0027s song, with cheering rousing chorus, As round our blazing fires we throng, The starry heavens o\u0027er us!\" \n\n\nJoseph\u0027s never been a good singer by any degree, but something about the emotion, the determination, the spirit in his voice, it awakens the same feelings in you. Slowly, a few voices, yours included, join in.\n\n\n\"Impatient for the coming fight, And as we wait the morning\u0027s light...!\"\n\n\nMore voices join the singing, as the voices grow louder and more fierce. \n\n\n\"Here in the silence of the night, We\u0027ll chant a soldier\u0027s song!\" the voices sing out into the night, \n\n\nThe song continues as your voices get louder, the song breaking through the cold, dark silence and filling you with inspiration. \n\n\n\"Soldiers are we whose lives are pledged to Ireland. Some have come from a land beyond the wave! Sworn to be free. No more our ancient sire land shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the gap of danger. In Erin\u0027s cause, come woe or weal!\"\n\n\nAt this point, not a voice is silent or passionless, dozens of voices roaring without pause, without regard for the enemy at the throat of the deathly rain of shrapnel and flames that landed minutes ago.\n\n\n\"\u0027Mid cannons\u0027 roar and rifles peal We will chant a soldier\u0027s song!\" you roar\n\n\nThe group continues singing into the endless darkness. It\u0027s clear to you, as your voice is added to dozens of others, that the Irish spirit hasn\u0027t been broken tonight.\n",
  "page 121": "\"Give me a few minutes, and we\u0027ll head into town. I\u0027m not ready yet, though.\"\n\n\n\"If you say so. Don\u0027t take too long,\" Joseph says, as you turn away from him. \n",
  "page 120": "You walk through the near empty streets of Dublin, strolling along the River Liffey. All around you are the destroyed wreckages of buildings devastated. Rubble fills the street, forcing you to walk over the chunks of rebar and concrete that fill the street. Bullet holes are thudded into the wall of a building, and you slowly run your fingers along them, peering inside at the pieces of metal still within.\n\n\n\"The machine guns did a number on these places,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"They could\u0027ve done a number on you,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"For God\u0027s sake, Michael, can you leave off it? I was trying to do what I could. I couldn\u0027t take the order to fight today. Next time, I\u0027m going to. This is only the beginning.\"\n\n\nYou continue to walk, staring around at the wreckage. You walk past the destroyed remains of a barricade, the shining, broken remainders of bayonets lying on the ground, from what must\u0027ve been a serious last charge. \n\n\nThe casualties of war are gone, their bodies dragged off for burial, but the blood still remains to show you how brutal the fighting was. A long smear runs across the road, where a dying man was dragged or tried to crawl away. The larger pool of dried blood tells you that he probably didn\u0027t make it. \n\n\n\"Hundreds lost in a week. So many souls lost,\" you whisper.\n\n\n\"They\u0027ll be remembered,\" Joseph says firmly.\n\n\nAlmost immediately, however, life seems to have gone. You watch as a woman pushes a stroller through the streets, narrowly avoiding debris as she coos at her baby. An old couple walks hand in hand down the street, admiring the river as if oblivious to the destruction around them. It\u0027s almost impressive how quickly the Irish people have bounced back.\n\n\nYou continue walking down the street, before you see them. The British have cordoned off a section of the road, and now they\u0027re escorting captured Volunteers down it. You watch as they try to round up the men and escort them down the road towards the trucks that can\u0027t drive through the rubble filled streets.\n\n\nYou look to see if you can recognize anyone from the crowd, but you can\u0027t, attempting to the prisoners.\n\n\n\"Heroes, the lot of them,\" Joseph says. \"I shoul...\"\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t fucking say it,\" you snarl.\n\n\nJoseph nods, before waving as the prisoners pass.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t wave at the prisoners!\" a British soldier barks.\n",

We didn\u0027t do anything!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Shut the fuck up, paddy,\" one of them says, as a rifle barrel presses against your neck. You pause, wondering what to do. You can fight, grabbing a rifle and taking it to a melee, you can try to escape, running off to get out of there, or you can back down and surrender.\n",
  "page 6": "\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\"\n\n\nA good quote, you think to yourself. It\u0027d have had to be written by an Irishman, of course. The English would never speak of themselves being in the gutter with the common muck,, they\u0027d claim to be of the stars themselves if they could. No, an Irishman would have to have written it, because only an Irishman would understand subjugation.\n\n\nYou stand under a gray sky, a field of barley and oats surrounding you. Thanks to it being August, there\u0027s relatively little to do, so you\u0027re given time to think. Of course, without working to keep you going, the thinking usually goes downhill. Either your evenings end with you grabbing the bottle, or staring at those stars as dreams of freedom fill your mind.\n\n\nEireann is truly in the gutter, you think to yourself. The British boot sits on her throat, keeping her down, like it has for hundreds of years. It will continue to, until the people can rise up and fix that problem. Of course, Britain weakens, its empire collapsing inwards. It\u0027s only a matter of time before you finish what the proud Fenians of old had started, what Wolfe Tone continued, and what your generation will finish: the fight for independence. \n\n\n\"Michael! Michael, get in here!\" a shrill voice screams from the farmhouse. \n\n\nYou turn, sighing, as you work towards the farmhouse, your boots plodding through the mud. It\u0027s always something with that woman, you think to yourself. You reach the door, pushing it inwards as you walk into your cramped kitchen. \n\n\n\"Ma, what\u0027s wrong?\" you say, leaning in the doorway.\n\n\nMa sits in the kitchen at the table, a newspaper in her hands. Joseph stands next to her, his tall, sturdy frame filling a long overcoat. Mary is staring around Joseph, a frail, timid creature in comparison to your burly brother, like a delicate flower growing next to a great Oak. Ma motions for you to see the paper, and you shrug, leaning in to see the pages.\n\n\nYou lean over, looking at the crinkled paper. \"BRITAIN AT WAR: GERMANY IGNORES FINAL ULTIMATUM\" reads the title.\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" you say.\n\n\nYou\u0027re struck in the face by Ma, who doesn\u0027t miss a beat in doing so. While the age has certainly taken much from the woman, it sure hasn\u0027t sapped her strength by how much it stings. Still, your mind is too focused on the looming war to even register the pain. \n\n\n\"Michael, don\u0027t take the Lord\u0027s name in vain!\" the old woman croaks.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war, Ma, don\u0027t blame him. He\u0027s shocked,\" Mary says, rubbing your arm.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war?\" Joseph says indignantly. \"When did Ireland declare war?! This is their doing, not ours!\"\n\n\n\"You can\u0027t be saying that, Joseph. It\u0027s our empire too!\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"Like bloody hell it is!\" Joseph says, stepping back to avoid the incoming slap from Ma. \"I\u0027d sooner bow downs to the King of Holland than the King of England.\"\n\n\n\"They gave us a parliament!\"\n\n\n\"They didn\u0027t give us a parliament! They promised us a parliament, which we haven\u0027t gotten! Now that\u0027ll be postponed because of the war, and when that\u0027s finished, we\u0027ll be feeling the British boot pressed against our throats yet again!\n\n\nThere\u0027s a short silence, as you all think about the repercussions this new war will have.\n\n\n\"Will you be signing up? They\u0027re recruiting,\" Mary says softly.\n\n\nJoseph lets out a barking laugh, shaking his head in disgust.\n\n\n\"Are you joking? Unless the Kaiser\u0027s recruiting Irishmen to take out the crown, you can count me out!\"\n\n\nJoseph spits on the ground, turning and heading out of the room. Ma immediately darts up as quick as a bullet, far faster than any old woman has a right to do, heading after him to give him another smack. You chuckle as the two rush out of the room. This leaves you and your sister standing alone around the table. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re in dark times, Michael,\" Mary says to you. \"I\u0027m worried about Joseph. He\u0027s been hanging around too many hotheads, violent thugs and brutes the lot of them!\"\n\n\n\"Joseph\u0027s fine,\" you say dismissively. \"How do you think he\u0027d react when you asked him if he\u0027d sign up?\"\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" she says. \"But, Michael, you understand, right? Why we need to serve the Empire, to prove the Irish are a loyal, hard-working people.\"\n\n\n\"To prove that to who?\" you say, annoyed. \"The British? They saw how loyal we are many a time, they just don\u0027t like what we\u0027re loyal to. We\u0027re Irish, Mary, not British. Don\u0027t forget it.\"\n\n\nMary turns in a huff, moving out of the room. Thankfully, this leaves you alone to think, and you let out a quiet sigh of contentment, sitting down at the table. You grab the newspaper, flicking through it. Might as well read up while you\u0027re alone.\n",
  "page 145": "You move in, smashing your fist into the side of Joseph\u0027s head with all your strength. He slams backwards, knocking him into the cold earth.\n\n\n\"You fucking bastard! You nearly got yourself killed, and you scared Mary and Ma half to death! Fuck, you scared me half to death! Ma\u0027s an old woman, she can\u0027t take the stress of having one of her sons do this!\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Michael,\" Joseph says. \"I did what I thought was right.\"\n\n\n\"Get up, you stupid bastard,\" you say, putting out your hand. \n\n\nJoseph grabs your hand, and you pull him up. You pull him in for a warm embrace, patting him on the back.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good to see you, Joseph,\" you say.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good to see you too, Michael. I\u0027ve missed you.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m guessing your time in Wales hasn\u0027t convinced you that violent nationalism is not the way forward.\"\n\n\nJoseph shakes his head, frowning.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Michael, but it hasn\u0027t.\"\n\n\nYou sigh, before nodding. \n\n\n\"So be it. We\u0027ll discuss it later. For now, let\u0027s let you see the family. Mary\u0027s missed you more than ever, and Ma\u0027s been praying everyday for you.\"\n\n\n\"Ma! Mary! I\u0027m home!\" Joseph says grinning, as you follow up up the porch for a family reunion.\n",
  "page 266": "With that, you begin the long journey home. It takes some time, and as you arrive, the sun is just disappearing over the hill, vanishing from your site. You push open the door to the same house, walking inside. Joseph and Ma sit at the kitchen table. Joseph\u0027s reading a book, while Ma stares, worried looking into the candle that sits in the middle of the table. You sit down next to her, sighing.\n\n\n\"I couldn\u0027t get anything for you,\" you say. \"The Black and Tans attacked, wrecking everything I bought. A huge waste of money even going out in the first place, really.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s OK, it doesn\u0027t matter,\" Ma says, absent-mindedly, her gaze not shifting from the flame.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Mary\u0027s gone missing,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Mary is an hour late to get home,\" Joseph says. \"She\u0027s not gone missing.\"\n\n\n\"Mary is never home late,\" Ma says. \"Never.\"\n\n\n\"She\u0027s probably out with Arthur,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Arthur\u0027s a good boy, he never ends of being late,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Never thought I\u0027d here you say that about a Unionist,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"We need to go out and look for her,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s fine,\" you say. \"She\u0027s a grown woman. She\u0027ll be home soon.\"\n\n\nYou quickly begin preparing dinner, getting the stove going and boiling the potatoes and getting everything ready. You make sure you\u0027re cooking up enough for Mary as well, because like Ma says, it\u0027s strange she\u0027s late. She\u0027ll definitely be home for dinner.\n\n\nYou\u0027re halfway through finishing dinner when the door to the farmhouse opens, as Mary arrives home.\n\n\n\"Thank Christ,\" you mutter under your breath, walking out to the entrance to the home.\n\n\nMary stands there, in the worst state you\u0027ve ever seen her in. Her hair is slick with blood, sticking to the side of her face as it smears it red. Her face is heavily bruised from what must\u0027ve been one serious beating. Her dress is nearly torn off her, with several tears along the skirt. Tears run down her discolored cheeks, as her lip quivers from the trauma of her night. A long cut runs across her forehead, disappearing to her hairline, with a trickle of blood running down her face and soaking her hair and scap with the dark blood. Her inner thighs and legs are slick with blood and... you grimace, as Mary stares at you with a distant, deadened look.\n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you say. \"Ma! Joseph! Get down here!\"\n\n\nYou rush over to her, wrapping her up as she presses her face into the the nook of your neck and shoulder. Ma and Joseph arrive on scene. Ma lets out a horrified shriek, running over to her daughter and giving her a tight hug as you step back.\n\n\n\"Oh my dear God, sweet God above, what\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened you?\" \n\n\n\"I... I was walking home, and he attacked me,\" she says in between sobs. \n\n\n\"Who? Who fucking did it?\" Joseph shouts.\n\n\n\"Calm down, Joseph,\" you say, grabbing his arm.\n\n\n\"Calm down? Don\u0027t you know what they did to her?!\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"And she doesn\u0027t need you yelling at her. Take it easy.\" \n\n\n\"Carter. The others called him Carter,\" she says softly. \n\n\n\"Leave her alone!\" Ma hisses, tears streaming down her face. \"Come on, sweetheart, you\u0027re alright, you\u0027re alright.\"\n\n\nMa leads Mary to the bed as she continuously sobs, as you\u0027re left with Joseph. You pause, staring blankly at Joseph, who is absolutely fuming with rage.\n\n\n\"That fucking bastard raped her,\" Joseph says. \"We\u0027ve been putting up with far too much, far too much bullshit because of cockroaches like these. We need to deal with him. This can\u0027t be left stand.\"\n\n\n\"What do you want us to do?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"We go group up my IRA unit. They\u0027re all good, brave men who\u0027d die for me, and sure as hell would kill for me and justify this. We organize an ambush. Blow Carter\u0027s head off with a fucking rifle and deal with this shit.\"\n\n\n\"We shouldn\u0027t involve your gang of thugs. This is our duty to deal with, not yours.

You burst out of the room, running ahead. The men waiting outside raise their rifles, opening fire. Bullets slam into your chest as you stumble forward, before another shot knocks you hard to the ground. You hit the ground with a thud, killing you instantly. You collapse to the ground, struggling to breath as smoke and blood fills your lungs. You desperately attempt to struggle forward. You groan, coughing up blood, before one of the soldiers strolls up to you, aiming his rifle at your skull.\n\n\n\"Burn in hell with the rest of this city, paddy,\" the man says, before pulling the trigger and blowing your brains out onto the floor. \n",
  "page 5": "There are several prominent factions that have power in Ireland.\n\n\nThe British Government are the rulers of Ireland, ever since the invasion of Ireland by King Henry VI. Through the Royal Irish Constabulary, or RIC police force they maintain control of the militias that are rising to power in Ireland.\n\n\nThe Irish Volunteers are a militia of Irish patriots who have risen up in response to the rise of the Ulster Volunteers to ensure, with violence if necessary, that nothing prevents the Home Rule Act from being passed. It is is led by Eoin MacNeill, although the actions of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary party has huge sway over it. They number over 180,000.\n\n\nThe Home Rule Party, now renamed as the Irish Parliamentary Party, is a political party that has pledged to fight for Irish Home Rule. They\u0027ve enjoyed huge popularity because of the recent passing of the Home Rule Act. They are led by John Redmond.\n\n\nThe Ulster Volunteers are a group of Protestants who have risen up and armed themselves, with the goal of resisting Home Rule at all costs. They signed the Solemn League and Covenant, pledging their lives to fight against Home Rule, some even signing in their own blood. They number over 100,000.\n\n\nThe Unionist Party is a political party that has pledged to keep Ireland under the British Parliament. They are popular among Protestants and in Ulster.\n\n\nThe Irish Republic Brotherhood (IRB) are an underground group that have pledged to rise up against the British and fight against their rule in order to get a free, independent Ireland. They are led by a secret military council, with Padraig Pearse holding the most power among them.\n\n\nSinn Fein is a political party that supports full Irish independence and the creation of an Irish republic that would be separate from Britain. It is led by Arthur Griffith. Unbeknownst to Griffith, it has a strong IRB element undercover in it.\n\n\nThe Irish Citizen Army is a militia made up of working class who support socialism and a change in the economy to give more rights to the worker, and a protection of workers rights in this time of industrialization. They are led by James Connolly.\n",
  "page 144": "Over the next six months, the situation changes, surprisingly. While initially, the rebels seem like villains, disturbing the peace and betraying Britain while she faces the evil Huns in the Great War, this quickly changes.\n\n\nEarly on, dozens of cases of atrocities committed by the British come out. Prisoners having been executed in the fighting. The destruction of property out of spite. The use of a pacifist activist as a human shield. Journalists being rounded up and executed by firing quad. Over a dozen civilians being rounded up and shot or bayoneted to death. All of that didn\u0027t even take into account Britain\u0027s indiscriminate shelling of the area. All of this coming to light quickly turns public favor, as makes the rebels, who took care to avoid civilian casualties, seem like the heroes of this uprising. Just as Padraig Pearse wanted, his men didn\u0027t achieve a tactical victory, but have become painted as martyrs for a cause, gaining huge support and lighting the fire of patriotism in the soul of every Irishman there.\n\n\nThen, the British saw fit to execute the sixteen key figures of the rising: Pádraic Pearse, Thomas Clarke, MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, Edward Daly, Michael O\u0027Hanrahan, Willie Pearse, John MacBride, Eamonn Ceantt, Michael Mallin, Sean Heuston, Con Colbert, Thomas Kent, Séan MacDiarmada and James Connolly.\n\n\nThese executions further made the British seem as oppressors rather than peace-keepers. Some of those executed weren\u0027t even leaders of the rising. John MacBride hadn\u0027t been aware of the rising until it began, while Thomas Kent hadn\u0027t participated in it.\n\n\nThe manner of execution was worse. John Connolly was so wounded he had to be tied in a chair to stay standing before his firing squad. Joseph Plunkett married his wife Grace Gifford, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism, seven hours before his execution. They weren\u0027t allowed to speak to each other or touch each other. He was shot later that day. Roger Casement, formerly Sir Roger Casement, a famed humanitarian who had done extensive charity work in Peru and the Congo, was hung, not even being given the soldier\u0027s death of a firing squad.\n\n\nStories like this quickly turned public support in favor of the rebels. Support for Sinn Féin, a nationalist political party, surged, as republicanism gained massive support. It became clear Britain was sitting on a powder keg as it tried to focus on dealing with this. In a desperate move to attempt to gain public approval, as Christmas nears, they make a decision to release the vast swathes of political prisoners held at Frongoch, otherwise known as the Rebels of the 1916 Easter rising. \n\n\nWith Sinn Féin rising into power, republicanism on the rise and a desperate longing for independence arising in the Irish zeitgeist, it seems clear that violence is coming.\n",

Are you sure you\u0027ll be able to get him back?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll be fine,\" he says. \"Hopefully, the IRA will deal with scum like that some day.\"\n\n\n\"They will, eventually,\" you say. \"Slan go foill.\" \n\n\n\"Slan go maile, agus go raibh mile maith agat,\" he says.\n",

If nothing else, the woman appreciates a cup of tea.\n\n\n\"Thank you, Michael,\" she says. \n\n\nYou grab the newspaper, and begin reading. \"John Redmond to address Irish volunteers\" is the title. Reading on, you learn that John Redmond is assembling the Irish Volunteers today for a grand speech. It\u0027s actually happening fairly close by, so it\u0027ll be easy to head down to it. \n\n\nJoseph walks into the room, taking off his cap and leaning over you to read the newspaper. \n\n\n\"Redmond\u0027s calling an assembly,\" you tell him. \"We should go.\"\n\n\n\"Give me a sec, I\u0027m still reading,\" he says, before staying silent for a brief moment. \"We should definitely go.

You grab his wrist, keeping steady, before dropping low to gather his papers.\n\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" you apologize. \"I was distracted by my brother.\"\n\n\n\"Not a problem, my man,\" the man replies, running a hand through his dark hair and he takes the papers back from you. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s easy to be distracted when you\u0027re accompanied by such a great big fool.\"\n\n\n\"Rory O\u0027Connor!

We shared a cell.\"\n\n\n\"Fought together? Bollocks, Rory, you didn\u0027t do any fighting. You went down and were captured almost immediately.\"\n\n\n\"I was hit by a sniper on a reconnaissance mission,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says, lifting his shirt slightly to show a scar where the bullet must\u0027ve entered.\n\n\n\"No one wants to see that old scar again,\" Joseph says. \"Don\u0027t you have somewhere to be? You were in an awful hurry.\"\n\n\n\"I do indeed, I\u0027ve a lot to do, actually,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says. \"Speaking of, you could help me in that. I\u0027m on a recruitment drive.\"\n\n\n\"For what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The Irish Republican Army. We\u0027re reorganizing the Irish Volunteers, turning them into a proper fighting force. I\u0027m taking on the role of Director of Engineering.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s no republic for there to be an army to fight for,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"That changes today. The Sinn Féin politicians are getting together to found the first Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, the assembly of Ireland. We will declare an Irish republic, and with that, the IRA will have a nation to fight for. So, Joseph, will you join the IRA and fight for this newfound nation?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m in,\" Joseph says, extending his hand as the two shake hands. \"I\u0027ll happily shed my blood for this country once more.\"\n\n\n\"Delightful,\" he says, grinning, before turning to you. \"You\u0027re welcome to join as well, you know,\" \n\n\n\"I\u0027m not a soldier. I served in the Irish Volunteers, but I never fought in the Easter Rising.\"\n\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t matter in the slightest. All that matters is whether you\u0027re willing to fight now, to protect our newfound nation. Surely you long for the independence of our glorious nation? Would you consider it?\"\n",
  "page 268": "You walk with Joseph down the dark streets towards the small bar known as the Boar\u0027s Head. You\u0027ve already searched several other bars for the man known as Carter, as well as all the local Black and Tan spots. The staunchly unionist Boar\u0027s Head Pub is one of the last places you\u0027ve left to check, but one of the most promising. A heavy revolver sits tucked away in your pocket, as Joseph pushes open the door and you follow Joseph inside.\n\n\nThe interior of a pub is a well lit, relatively empty place. Apart from a few old patrons, the main customers of the place are a group of uniformed Black and Tans who sit around a table.\n\n\n\"That\u0027s gotta be them?\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s do this,\" you say, walking forward.\n\n\nYou walk up to the group of men, leaning down over them as their laughter and conversation grows soft.\n\n\n\"Hello there, lads.

  "page 7": "You\u0027re a young man of nineteen years, a mind full of wit and a heart full of ideals. With a relatively moderate sized farm, for a Catholic, you\u0027re not doing too badly for yourself, with enough crops to feed and cloth the family with even a bit left over, but you\u0027re a far sight from rich, instead forced to work hard during the Spring and Autumn months, laboring away to keep the farm going.\n\n\nYour father died a good few years ago, when sepsis hit him hard. Ma was left to finish raising you all, and with her strict Catholic upbringing, she worked hard at it. Sure, she raised a pair of lads who take to the drink a bit too often, aren\u0027t afraid to gamble and swear as much as any other man, but you\u0027re both good, moral, god-fearing men. \n\n\nJoseph has always been the more quick. As your younger brother, he never learnt discipline at the end of your father\u0027s belt, so once he learned to overcome the sting of Ma\u0027s slaps, he was a rogue from then on. Short-tempered and quick to fight, he\u0027s a passionate fellow. Rather than raise his hand to a woman he\u0027d sooner hack it off, and if you\u0027re good to him, he\u0027d never betray you as long as he\u0027d live.\n\n\nMary, on the other hand, is a frail, gentle creature. She\u0027s always kind-hearted to a fault, she\u0027s toss a bone to a wolf. A good, Catholic, chaste and modest girl, she\u0027s the envy of more than a few boys. Of course, given that she has Joseph and you for brothers, it\u0027s enough to keep them away. However, she\u0027s too young and naive to understand that the relationship between the British and Irish isn\u0027t a peaceful one, still thinking that there\u0027s a chance for peace between you two.\n\n\nAll in all, you\u0027ve a good, strong Irish family, working the fields to survive like many, many others. \n",

You\u0027re still a hardcore, blood-shedding Nationalist, then?\"\n\n\n\"Even more so.\"\n\n\nYou sigh, before nodding. \n\n\n\"So be it. We\u0027ll discuss it later.

  "page 2": "\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\"\n\n\nA good quote, you think to yourself. It\u0027d have had to be written by an Irishman, of course. The English would never speak of themselves being in the gutter with the common muck,, they\u0027d claim to be of the stars themselves if they could. No, an Irishman would have to have written it, because only an Irishman would understand subjugation.\n\n\nYou stand under a gray sky, a field of barley and oats surrounding you. Thanks to it being August, there\u0027s relatively little to do, so you\u0027re given time to think. Of course, without working to keep you going, the thinking usually goes downhill. Either your evenings end with you grabbing the bottle, or staring at those stars as dreams of freedom fill your mind.\n\n\nEireann is truly in the gutter, you think to yourself. The British boot sits on her throat, keeping her down, like it has for hundreds of years. It will continue to, until the people can rise up and fix that problem. Of course, Britain weakens, its empire collapsing inwards. It\u0027s only a matter of time before you finish what the proud Fenians of old had started, what Wolfe Tone continued, and what your generation will finish: the fight for independence. \n\n\n\"Michael! Michael, get in here!\" a shrill voice screams from the farmhouse. \n\n\nYou turn, sighing, as you work towards the farmhouse, your boots plodding through the mud. It\u0027s always something with that woman, you think to yourself. You reach the door, pushing it inwards as you walk into your cramped kitchen. \n\n\n\"Ma, what\u0027s wrong?\" you say, leaning in the doorway.\n\n\nMa sits in the kitchen at the table, a newspaper in her hands. Joseph stands next to her, his tall, sturdy frame filling a long overcoat. Mary is staring around Joseph, a frail, timid creature in comparison to your burly brother, like a delicate flower growing next to a great Oak. Ma motions for you to see the paper, and you shrug, leaning in to see the pages.\n\n\nYou lean over, looking at the crinkled paper. \"BRITAIN AT WAR: GERMANY IGNORES FINAL ULTIMATUM\" reads the title.\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" you say.\n\n\nYou\u0027re struck in the face by Ma, who doesn\u0027t miss a beat in doing so. While the age has certainly taken much from the woman, it sure hasn\u0027t sapped her strength by how much it stings. Still, your mind is too focused on the looming war to even register the pain. \n\n\n\"Michael, don\u0027t take the Lord\u0027s name in vain!\" the old woman croaks.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war, Ma, don\u0027t blame him. He\u0027s shocked,\" Mary says, rubbing your arm.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war?\" Joseph says indignantly. \"When did Ireland declare war?! This is their doing, not ours!\"\n\n\n\"You can\u0027t be saying that, Joseph. It\u0027s our empire too!\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"Like bloody hell it is!\" Joseph says, stepping back to avoid the incoming slap from Ma. \"I\u0027d sooner bow downs to the King of Holland than the King of England.\"\n\n\n\"They gave us a parliament!\"\n\n\n\"They didn\u0027t give us a parliament! They promised us a parliament, which we haven\u0027t gotten! Now that\u0027ll be postponed because of the war, and when that\u0027s finished, we\u0027ll be feeling the British boot pressed against our throats yet again!\n\n\nThere\u0027s a short silence, as you all think about the repercussions this new war will have.\n\n\n\"Will you be signing up? They\u0027re recruiting,\" Mary says softly.\n\n\nJoseph lets out a barking laugh, shaking his head in disgust.\n\n\n\"Are you joking? Unless the Kaiser\u0027s recruiting Irishmen to take out the crown, you can count me out!\"\n\n\nJoseph spits on the ground, turning and heading out of the room. Ma immediately darts up as quick as a bullet, far faster than any old woman has a right to do, heading after him to give him another smack. You chuckle as the two rush out of the room. This leaves you and your sister standing alone around the table. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re in dark times, Michael,\" Mary says to you. \"I\u0027m worried about Joseph. He\u0027s been hanging around too many hotheads, violent thugs and brutes the lot of them!\"\n\n\n\"Joseph\u0027s fine,\" you say dismissively. \"How do you think he\u0027d react when you asked him if he\u0027d sign up?\"\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" she says. \"But, Michael, you understand, right? Why we need to serve the Empire, to prove the Irish are a loyal, hard-working people.\"\n\n\n\"To prove that to who?\" you say, annoyed. \"The British? They saw how loyal we are many a time, they just don\u0027t like what we\u0027re loyal to. We\u0027re Irish, Mary, not British. Don\u0027t forget it.\"\n\n\nMary turns in a huff, moving out of the room. Thankfully, this leaves you alone to think, and you let out a quiet sigh of contentment, sitting down at the table. You grab the newspaper, flicking through it. Might as well read up while you\u0027re alone.\n",

What a homecoming.\n\n\nYou arrive at the old wooden door to the place, pulling it open as you stroll inside. \n\n\n\"Hello?\" you ask loudly. \n\n\nMary appears out of the kitchen, looking at you. She certainly looks older now, her hair longer, her face more matured and like a woman rather than a girl, her body less boyish than you\u0027d have hoped as she\u0027s matured into a full, grown woman.

With almost surprising strength she squeezes you tightly, planting a kiss on your lips before another goes on your cheek.\n\n\n\"My two boys, both come home to me after being taken!\" Ma shrieks loudly, pulling you in for a tight hug. \"Oh Michael, the Lord has blessed me. He\u0027s so good to me, Michael, so good to me.\" \n\n\n\"Two boys? Where was Joseph?\" you ask.\n\n\nThen, Joseph appears from outside, his hands and face covered in dirt. His bearded face grins wide, as he wraps his arms around his entire family, squeezing you to an almost painful degree.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good to see you, Michael. I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re back? How was it? France, Turkey, Germany?\"\n\n\n\"They were all as miserably cold and rainy as Ireland, except without there being any Irish there.

Gone for four years, and that\u0027s the second thing you say to me?\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh Michael, I\u0027m making sure you don\u0027t become some brute. You just know I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. I\u0027m so glad to have my two sons under my roof again. I can\u0027t tell you how desperately lonely it was for me and Mary living in the same house.\"\n\n\nYou raise your eyes, looking at Joseph, as the grin slips from his face and he pales.\n\n\n\"Where were you, Joseph?\" you ask, before cracking a smile. \"You didn\u0027t try run off with a Protestant girl, get hitched off in Cork and get the ferry to England, did you?\"\n\n\n\"I was imprisoned on Frongoch, in Wales,\" Joseph says sternly.\n\n\n\"For what?\" you say, growing serious, the grin slipping off your face. \n\n\n\"I fought in the Easter Rising with the rebels,\" Joseph says.\n\n\nYou pause, nodding. Joseph was among the rebels who fought in the Easter Rising. The men who you would\u0027ve been fighting alongside if not Casement\u0027s capture. You pause, thinking that through, remembering what\u0027s happened. Although it\u0027s probably best to keep the amount of people who know about the betrayal and your treason to a minimum, it might be worth telling Joseph about your attempt to help him.\n",
  "page 1": "The nation of Ireland has had a long and varied history. From the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who walked there via land bridge, the Neolithic Men behind the ancient and amazing Newgrange, the Celts who soon popularized the country when it was known as Hibernia and from the Christians who spread after the return of Saint Patrick, who was enslaved by Irish pirates in his youth and endless Viking attacks, there\u0027s been a long history of pioneers and innovators creating a proud and noble nation.\n\n\nIrish history first has serious Anglo involvement in the Norman invasion of Ireland. Before then Ireland was simply a series of kingdoms and warring clans. The larger and more advanced Norman forces soon managed to conquer considerable sections of Ireland. However, rather than push for a full takeover, English focuses soon shifted, leaving a fortified area known as the Pale around Dublin under British control, with the rest mostly being allowed to survive under local rule. After this, there was a divide in power between the Gaelic Lords who could trace their origins back to the Celts who popularized the lands, and the Norman lords descended from those who sought to conquer the island.\n\n\nHowever, in 1536, Henry VII led an invasion of Ireland. Although there was brutal fighting as the Irish appealed to Catholic Spain for help, Ireland was soon conquered. Then, with a religious divide forming due to the birth of Protestantism, the issues first began arising. Using a system of land confiscation and colonization known as Plantation, English and Scottish Protestants were given Irish land to run, using the Irish Catholics as slaves. Although there were many brutal Irish rebellions such as the War of the Three Kings, which succeeded temporarily before the re-conquest of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell, the Rebellion of 1641, which was fought over the division between Catholics and Protestants, and many more bloody and brutal rebellions, Ireland failed ot successfully regain control of its lands, and were treated as second class citizens by the Protestants who ruled over the country.\n",

You know what I mean.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, shrugging.\n\n\n\"Christ, you really haven\u0027t been with many girls. Or more accurately, any girls. She liked you, Michael. Speaking of, I\u0027ve heard there\u0027s more than a few girls are on the hunt for a man like you, you know. Katie Hales, for instance.\"\n\n\n\"The one with the face like a horse? I\u0027ll pass, Joseph.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, don\u0027t be a bollocks. Jane Garrety. She\u0027s a pretty girl, you can\u0027t argue with me there.\"\n\n\n\"Barely a personality there at all. I\u0027d sooner marry horse-face.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re an awful man. There must be some woman you like.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, as Joseph groans in frustration.\n\n\n\"You know, maybe those rumors are true, for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027ve heard the rumors before, and this. The accuracy in them might be what makes them so enraging.\n\n\n\"Watch your fucking tone with me,\" you growl.\" I swear to fuck, I will put your head through a fucking wall.\" \n\n\n\"Shit, sorry, sorry!\" Joseph says, raising his hands defensively. \"Didn\u0027t mean to start anything.\"\n\n\n\"Then don\u0027t,\" you say tersely.\n\n\nYou walk on for about a minute as Joseph goes silent and cowers down. Finally, he decides to break the silence again.\n\n\n\"So, shall we get the whiskey?\" Joseph asks innocently. \n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you mutter. \n\n\n\"Well, I don\u0027t hear any suggestions from you.\"\n\n\n\"Something girly. A dress, or something.\"\n\n\n\"Do you know Mary\u0027s size?\" Joseph asks, as you stare at him blankly.\n\n\n\"Ah for fuck\u0027s sake, I don\u0027t know. She\u0027s fairly small.\"\n\n\n\"I doubt \"fairly small\" is a dress size.\"\n\n\n\"Christ above, then get her a book, or a fucking c...!\"\n\n\nYou slam into another man, knocking his papers to the ground as he nearly tips backwards. You grab his wrist, keeping steady, before dropping low to gather his papers.\n\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" you apologize. \"I was distracted by my brother.\"\n\n\n\"Not a problem, my man,\" the man replies, running a hand through his dark hair and he takes the papers back from you. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s easy to be distracted when you\u0027re accompanied by such a great big fool.\"\n\n\n\"Rory O\u0027Connor! How are you doing, my fine friend?\" Joseph grins.\n\n\n\"You know each other?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Joseph and I fought together in the Easter Rising, and we were imprisoned together at Frongoch. We shared a cell.\"\n\n\n\"Fought together? Bollocks, Rory, you didn\u0027t do any fighting. You went down and were captured almost immediately.\"\n\n\n\"I was hit by a sniper on a reconnaissance mission,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says, lifting his shirt slightly to show a scar where the bullet must\u0027ve entered.\n\n\n\"No one wants to see that old scar again,\" Joseph says. \"Don\u0027t you have somewhere to be? You were in an awful hurry.\"\n\n\n\"I do indeed, I\u0027ve a lot to do, actually,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says. \"Speaking of, you could help me in that. I\u0027m on a recruitment drive.\"\n\n\n\"For what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The Irish Republican Army. We\u0027re reorganizing the Irish Volunteers, turning them into a proper fighting force. I\u0027m taking on the role of Director of Engineering.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s no republic for there to be an army to fight for,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"That changes today. The Sinn Féin politicians are getting together to found the first Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, the assembly of Ireland. We will declare an Irish republic, and with that, the IRA will have a nation to fight for. So, Joseph, will you join the IRA and fight for this newfound nation?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m in,\" Joseph says, extending his hand as the two shake hands. \"I\u0027ll happily shed my blood for this country once more.\"\n\n\n\"Delightful,\" he says, grinning, before turning to you. \"You\u0027re welcome to join as well, you know,\" \n\n\n\"I\u0027m not a soldier. I served in the Irish Volunteers, but I never fought in the Easter Rising.\"\n\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t matter in the slightest. All that matters is whether you\u0027re willing to fight now, to protect our newfound nation. Surely you long for the independence of our glorious nation? Would you consider it?\"\n",
  "page 4": "\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\"\n\n\nA good quote, you think to yourself. It\u0027d have had to be written by an Irishman, of course. The English would never speak of themselves being in the gutter with the common muck,, they\u0027d claim to be of the stars themselves if they could. No, an Irishman would have to have written it, because only an Irishman would understand subjugation.\n\n\nYou stand under a gray sky, a field of barley and oats surrounding you. Thanks to it being August, there\u0027s relatively little to do, so you\u0027re given time to think. Of course, without working to keep you going, the thinking usually goes downhill. Either your evenings end with you grabbing the bottle, or staring at those stars as dreams of freedom fill your mind.\n\n\nEireann is truly in the gutter, you think to yourself. The British boot sits on her throat, keeping her down, like it has for hundreds of years. It will continue to, until the people can rise up and fix that problem. Of course, Britain weakens, its empire collapsing inwards. It\u0027s only a matter of time before you finish what the proud Fenians of old had started, what Wolfe Tone continued, and what your generation will finish: the fight for independence. \n\n\n\"Michael! Michael, get in here!\" a shrill voice screams from the farmhouse. \n\n\nYou turn, sighing, as you work towards the farmhouse, your boots plodding through the mud. It\u0027s always something with that woman, you think to yourself. You reach the door, pushing it inwards as you walk into your cramped kitchen. \n\n\n\"Ma, what\u0027s wrong?\" you say, leaning in the doorway.\n\n\nMa sits in the kitchen at the table, a newspaper in her hands. Joseph stands next to her, his tall, sturdy frame filling a long overcoat. Mary is staring around Joseph, a frail, timid creature in comparison to your burly brother, like a delicate flower growing next to a great Oak. Ma motions for you to see the paper, and you shrug, leaning in to see the pages.\n\n\nYou lean over, looking at the crinkled paper. \"BRITAIN AT WAR: GERMANY IGNORES FINAL ULTIMATUM\" reads the title.\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" you say.\n\n\nYou\u0027re struck in the face by Ma, who doesn\u0027t miss a beat in doing so. While the age has certainly taken much from the woman, it sure hasn\u0027t sapped her strength by how much it stings. Still, your mind is too focused on the looming war to even register the pain. \n\n\n\"Michael, don\u0027t take the Lord\u0027s name in vain!\" the old woman croaks.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war, Ma, don\u0027t blame him. He\u0027s shocked,\" Mary says, rubbing your arm.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war?\" Joseph says indignantly. \"When did Ireland declare war?! This is their doing, not ours!\"\n\n\n\"You can\u0027t be saying that, Joseph. It\u0027s our empire too!\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"Like bloody hell it is!\" Joseph says, stepping back to avoid the incoming slap from Ma. \"I\u0027d sooner bow downs to the King of Holland than the King of England.\"\n\n\n\"They gave us a parliament!\"\n\n\n\"They didn\u0027t give us a parliament! They promised us a parliament, which we haven\u0027t gotten! Now that\u0027ll be postponed because of the war, and when that\u0027s finished, we\u0027ll be feeling the British boot pressed against our throats yet again!\n\n\nThere\u0027s a short silence, as you all think about the repercussions this new war will have.\n\n\n\"Will you be signing up? They\u0027re recruiting,\" Mary says softly.\n\n\nJoseph lets out a barking laugh, shaking his head in disgust.\n\n\n\"Are you joking? Unless the Kaiser\u0027s recruiting Irishmen to take out the crown, you can count me out!\"\n\n\nJoseph spits on the ground, turning and heading out of the room. Ma immediately darts up as quick as a bullet, far faster than any old woman has a right to do, heading after him to give him another smack. You chuckle as the two rush out of the room. This leaves you and your sister standing alone around the table. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re in dark times, Michael,\" Mary says to you. \"I\u0027m worried about Joseph. He\u0027s been hanging around too many hotheads, violent thugs and brutes the lot of them!\"\n\n\n\"Joseph\u0027s fine,\" you say dismissively. \"How do you think he\u0027d react when you asked him if he\u0027d sign up?\"\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" she says. \"But, Michael, you understand, right? Why we need to serve the Empire, to prove the Irish are a loyal, hard-working people.\"\n\n\n\"To prove that to who?\" you say, annoyed. \"The British? They saw how loyal we are many a time, they just don\u0027t like what we\u0027re loyal to. We\u0027re Irish, Mary, not British. Don\u0027t forget it.\"\n\n\nMary turns in a huff, moving out of the room. Thankfully, this leaves you alone to think, and you let out a quiet sigh of contentment, sitting down at the table. You grab the newspaper, flicking through it. Might as well read up while you\u0027re alone.\n",
  "page 3": "Ireland is home to a serious cultural divide. The majority of Ireland is made up of the Irish Catholics descended from the original Celtic tribes as well as British colonists who interbred with them. They\u0027re the vast majority in Ireland, although due to British-caused sectarianism they\u0027re much poorer than the Protestant majority. The Catholics are the main supporters for the Home Rule movement, which wants Ireland to have its own parliament. \n\n\nThe other main ethnic group are the Protestants, descended from later British colonists who arrived with a specialized attempt to further colonize Ireland with the plantations, which were more successfully in the Northern Province of Ulster, leading to that being the richest and most Protestant-controlled area. The Protestants are much richer and more powerful in comparison to the Catholics thanks to British backing. They\u0027re behind the Unionist movement that wants to stay under the rule of Britain\u0027s parliament to keep power in Protestant hands.\n\n\nIreland suffers from serious political divide for these reasons. Ireland is ruled by the British Monarch and Parliament, although recent acts have passed to give Ireland it\u0027s own parliament, though Britain will still be in power over Ireland and be in charge of war, trade, foreign policy and war. Still the recent war with Germany has prevented this from being put into place. There\u0027s a small, hardcore movement that wants full Irish independence with the party Sinn Fein, although the success of the Home Rule Party in passing the recent acts have drawn votes away from the party.\n",

  "page 9": "You\u0027re a young man of nineteen years, a mind full of wit and a heart full of ideals. With a relatively moderate sized farm, for a Catholic, you\u0027re not doing too badly for yourself, with enough crops to feed and cloth the family with even a bit left over, but you\u0027re a far sight from rich, instead forced to work hard during the Spring and Autumn months, laboring away to keep the farm going.\n\n\nYour father died a good few years ago, when sepsis hit him hard. Ma was left to finish raising you all, and with her strict Catholic upbringing, she worked hard at it. Sure, she raised a pair of lads who take to the drink a bit too often, aren\u0027t afraid to gamble and swear as much as any other man, but you\u0027re both good, moral, god-fearing men. \n\n\nJoseph has always been the more quick. As your younger brother, he never learnt discipline at the end of your father\u0027s belt, so once he learned to overcome the sting of Ma\u0027s slaps, he was a rogue from then on. Short-tempered and quick to fight, he\u0027s a passionate fellow. Rather than raise his hand to a woman he\u0027d sooner hack it off, and if you\u0027re good to him, he\u0027d never betray you as long as he\u0027d live.\n\n\nMary, on the other hand, is a frail, gentle creature. She\u0027s always kind-hearted to a fault, she\u0027s toss a bone to a wolf. A good, Catholic, chaste and modest girl, she\u0027s the envy of more than a few boys. Of course, given that she has Joseph and you for brothers, it\u0027s enough to keep them away. However, she\u0027s too young and naive to understand that the relationship between the British and Irish isn\u0027t a peaceful one, still thinking that there\u0027s a chance for peace between you two.\n\n\nAll in all, you\u0027ve a good, strong Irish family, working the fields to survive like many, many others. \n",

Please.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Michael, but I can\u0027t,\" Joseph says, pushing past you and heading out the door. \"I\u0027ll see you soon. Tell Ma and Mary I love them dearly. Sorry we had to come to this at gunpoint.\"\n\n\nThe gun still pointed at your chest, Joseph slowly moves out of the room, making sure to keep enough distance from you to avoid giving you a chance to strike.

All that\u0027s left to do is to drown your sorrows.\n\n\nYou stare over at the cabinet, standing. You trudge over, pulling the cabinet door open as you pull out a bottle of fine, expensive Irish whiskey. Or more accurately, Irish whiskey. You grab a clay mug, pulling it from the cabinet and laying it on the table. You slowly twist off the bottle\u0027s cork, pulling it off to get a scent of the toxic cure inside. You slowly pour the mug, about half full with the liquid, before lifting it, pressing the brim of the mug to your lips.\n\n\n\"For Eireann,\" you say, downing the mug of burning liquid. \n",

Joseph, perhaps a moment slower, laughs.\n\n\n\"So what, our sister\u0027s been gifted with the virgin birth like the original Mar...\" Joseph seems to understand the situation about halfway through, and quiets down as a silence defends over the group.\n\n\n\"Does Arthur know?\" you ask after a moment.\n\n\n\"He does,\" Mary nods.\n\n\n\"And he\u0027s still willing to marry and raise the child?\" you ask, as Mary nods. \"Then we just don\u0027t tell anybody what happens. Not the community, not the Church, not even the child. We can move past this.\"\n\n\nMary nods quietly, as tears begin to run down her face. You grab her, hugging her tightly against your chest. \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, doll, we\u0027ll deal with that.\" \n\n\nYou all embrace each other, gently hoping you can get through this.\n",

After a few months back in Dublin, you\u0027ve quickly went back into the thick of it, planning out ambushes and raids and serving with Joseph as Fionn\u0027s seconds. Ever since the Black and Tans showed up, there\u0027s been a huge amount of recruits, meaning you spend quite a bit of time training and drilling them. Although the war continues to be brutal, exhausting the forces of both the British and the Irish, it\u0027s clear the war\u0027s reaching a boiling point for both side. Victory or defeat is on the horizon, although you can\u0027t tell which. \n\n\nYou stroll into Fionn\u0027s farmhouse, followed by Joesph. Although it\u0027s not a training day and there\u0027s no attack planned, he\u0027s called for you to come talk to him. You move inside, where Joseph sits at his kitchen table, his little brother sitting next for him, buttering some bread.\n\n\n\"Oh, good, you\u0027re here,\" Fionn says. \"Aidan, give us a few minutes, can you?\"\n\n\n\"Can\u0027t I stay and listen?\" Aidan asks, as Fionn shakes his head.\n\n\n\"No, get out of here,\" Fionn says, as Aidan leaves the room.\n\n\n\"Is everything alright?\" Joseph asks. \n\n\n\"Not exactly. I need your help making a decision,\" Fionn asks. \"I\u0027m having a bit of trouble with loyalty.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s a traitor among our unit?\"\n\n\n\"There may be, but if there is, it\u0027s me,\" Fionn laughs.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re not thinking of surrender, are you?\" you ask, worried.\n\n\n\"Of course not. However, the President of the Dáil has asked for some of our men to attend an attack on the Customs House.\"\n\n\n\"And?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Eamon DeValera\u0027s plan is that a significant attack of like 120 IRA soldiers in full uniform on a major British target would help to show that we\u0027re not a terrorist movement of criminals. It\u0027d be a huge propaganda victory and be a massive symbol for the success of our whole movement.\"\n\n\n\"So what\u0027s the issue?\" Joseph asks. \n\n\n\"It\u0027d be a massacre, that\u0027s the issue. Michael Collins pointed out that our success so far has been through guerilla warfare, and he\u0027s right. In outright battles, we\u0027d be decimated. Michael Collins called for units to increase in guerilla warfare as a counter to this, but he\u0027s been outvoted. So I need to decide whether I\u0027m lending my unit to the Customs House attack in a months time, or whether I\u0027m to simply increase in our use of guerilla warfare and raise the attacks. So, I\u0027ve come to you. We can join in the symbolic attack to prove we\u0027re a real army, so that maybe the outside world will recognize us and this war can end. Or, we can keep the fight going as guerilla fighters. I need your opinions.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not a tactician. I can lead in battle, but I sure as hell don\u0027t know how to command the forces on that grand a level,\" Joseph admits. \"Michael?\"\n",

Immediately, a dozen guns are aiming at him.\n\n\n\"Stop, you stupid bugger!\" Joseph yells.\n\n\nThe caretaker keeps rushing off, before the gun fires, and the back of his head explodes.

  "page 133": "Over the next six months, the situation changes, surprisingly. While initially, the rebels seem like villains, disturbing the peace and betraying Britain while she faces the evil Huns in the Great War, this quickly changes.\n\n\nEarly on, dozens of cases of atrocities committed by the British come out. Prisoners having been executed in the fighting. The destruction of property out of spite. The use of a pacifist activist as a human shield. Journalists being rounded up and executed by firing quad. Over a dozen civilians being rounded up and shot or bayoneted to death. All of that didn\u0027t even take into account Britain\u0027s indiscriminate shelling of the area. All of this coming to light quickly turns public favor, as makes the rebels, who took care to avoid civilian casualties, seem like the heroes of this uprising. Just as Padraig Pearse wanted, his men didn\u0027t achieve a tactical victory, but have become painted as martyrs for a cause, gaining huge support and lighting the fire of patriotism in the soul of every Irishman there.\n\n\nThen, the British saw fit to execute the sixteen key figures of the rising: Pádraic Pearse, Thomas Clarke, MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, Edward Daly, Michael O\u0027Hanrahan, Willie Pearse, John MacBride, Eamonn Ceantt, Michael Mallin, Sean Heuston, Con Colbert, Thomas Kent, Séan MacDiarmada and James Connolly.\n\n\nThese executions further made the British seem as oppressors rather than peace-keepers. Some of those executed weren\u0027t even leaders of the rising. John MacBride hadn\u0027t been aware of the rising until it began, while Thomas Kent hadn\u0027t participated in it.\n\n\nThe manner of execution was worse. John Connolly was so wounded he had to be tied in a chair to stay standing before his firing squad. Joseph Plunkett married his wife Grace Gifford, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism, seven hours before his execution. They weren\u0027t allowed to speak to each other or touch each other. He was shot later that day. Roger Casement, formerly Sir Roger Casement, a famed humanitarian who had done extensive charity work in Peru and the Congo, was hung, not even being given the soldier\u0027s death of a firing squad.\n\n\nStories like this quickly turned public support in favor of the rebels. Support for Sinn Féin, a nationalist political party, surged, as republicanism gained massive support. It became clear Britain was sitting on a powder keg as it tried to focus on dealing with this. In a desperate move to attempt to gain public approval, as Christmas nears, they make a decision to release the vast swathes of political prisoners held at Frongoch, otherwise known as the Rebels of the 1916 Easter rising. \n\n\nIt\u0027s a dark, cold night, and you\u0027ve the stove on in the house. You stand on the porch, staring at the cold wind rustles the fields, a cigarette in your hand. You inhale through your teeth, staring outwards.

Her hair is slick with blood, sticking to the side of her face as it smears it red. Her face is heavily bruised from what must\u0027ve been one serious beating. Her dress is nearly torn off her, with several tears along the skirt. Tears run down her discolored cheeks, as her lip quivers from the trauma of her night. A long cut runs across her forehead, disappearing to her hairline, with a trickle of blood running down her face and soaking her hair and scap with the dark blood. Her inner thighs and legs are slick with blood and... you grimace, as Mary stares at you with a distant, deadened look.\n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you say. \"Ma! Joseph! Get down here!\"\n\n\nYou rush over to her, wrapping her up as she presses her face into the the nook of your neck and shoulder. Ma and Joseph arrive on scene.

What\u0027s happened you?\" \n\n\n\"I... I was walking home, and he attacked me,\" she says in between sobs. \n\n\n\"Who? Who fucking did it?\" Joseph shouts.\n\n\n\"Calm down, Joseph,\" you say, grabbing his arm.\n\n\n\"Calm down? Don\u0027t you know what they did to her?!\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"And she doesn\u0027t need you yelling at her. Take it easy.\" \n\n\n\"Carter.

You pause, staring blankly at Joseph, who is absolutely fuming with rage.\n\n\n\"That fucking bastard raped her,\" Joseph says. \"We\u0027ve been putting up with far too much, far too much bullshit because of cockroaches like these. We need to deal with him. This can\u0027t be left stand.\"\n\n\n\"What do you want us to do?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"We go group up my IRA unit.

While initially, the rebels seem like villains, disturbing the peace and betraying Britain while she faces the evil Huns in the Great War, this quickly changes.\n\n\nEarly on, dozens of cases of atrocities committed by the British come out. Prisoners having been executed in the fighting. The destruction of property out of spite. The use of a pacifist activist as a human shield. Journalists being rounded up and executed by firing quad. Over a dozen civilians being rounded up and shot or bayoneted to death. All of that didn\u0027t even take into account Britain\u0027s indiscriminate shelling of the area. All of this coming to light quickly turns public favor, as makes the rebels, who took care to avoid civilian casualties, seem like the heroes of this uprising.

Some of those executed weren\u0027t even leaders of the rising. John MacBride hadn\u0027t been aware of the rising until it began, while Thomas Kent hadn\u0027t participated in it.\n\n\nThe manner of execution was worse. John Connolly was so wounded he had to be tied in a chair to stay standing before his firing squad.

Support for Sinn Féin, a nationalist political party, surged, as republicanism gained massive support. It became clear Britain was sitting on a powder keg as it tried to focus on dealing with this.

The English would never speak of themselves being in the gutter with the common muck,, they\u0027d claim to be of the stars themselves if they could. No, an Irishman would have to have written it, because only an Irishman would understand subjugation.\n\n\nYou stand under a gray sky, a field of barley and oats surrounding you. Thanks to it being August, there\u0027s relatively little to do, so you\u0027re given time to think. Of course, without working to keep you going, the thinking usually goes downhill. Either your evenings end with you grabbing the bottle, or staring at those stars as dreams of freedom fill your mind.\n\n\nEireann is truly in the gutter, you think to yourself. The British boot sits on her throat, keeping her down, like it has for hundreds of years. It will continue to, until the people can rise up and fix that problem. Of course, Britain weakens, its empire collapsing inwards. It\u0027s only a matter of time before you finish what the proud Fenians of old had started, what Wolfe Tone continued, and what your generation will finish: the fight for independence. \n\n\n\"Michael!

You reach the door, pushing it inwards as you walk into your cramped kitchen. \n\n\n\"Ma, what\u0027s wrong?\" you say, leaning in the doorway.\n\n\nMa sits in the kitchen at the table, a newspaper in her hands. Joseph stands next to her, his tall, sturdy frame filling a long overcoat. Mary is staring around Joseph, a frail, timid creature in comparison to your burly brother, like a delicate flower growing next to a great Oak. Ma motions for you to see the paper, and you shrug, leaning in to see the pages.\n\n\nYou lean over, looking at the crinkled paper. \"BRITAIN AT WAR: GERMANY IGNORES FINAL ULTIMATUM\" reads the title.\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" you say.\n\n\nYou\u0027re struck in the face by Ma, who doesn\u0027t miss a beat in doing so. While the age has certainly taken much from the woman, it sure hasn\u0027t sapped her strength by how much it stings. Still, your mind is too focused on the looming war to even register the pain. \n\n\n\"Michael, don\u0027t take the Lord\u0027s name in vain!\" the old woman croaks.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re at war, Ma, don\u0027t blame him.

This is their doing, not ours!\"\n\n\n\"You can\u0027t be saying that, Joseph. It\u0027s our empire too!\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"Like bloody hell it is!\" Joseph says, stepping back to avoid the incoming slap from Ma. \"I\u0027d sooner bow downs to the King of Holland than the King of England.\"\n\n\n\"They gave us a parliament!\"\n\n\n\"They didn\u0027t give us a parliament! They promised us a parliament, which we haven\u0027t gotten! Now that\u0027ll be postponed because of the war, and when that\u0027s finished, we\u0027ll be feeling the British boot pressed against our throats yet again!\n\n\nThere\u0027s a short silence, as you all think about the repercussions this new war will have.\n\n\n\"Will you be signing up? They\u0027re recruiting,\" Mary says softly.\n\n\nJoseph lets out a barking laugh, shaking his head in disgust.\n\n\n\"Are you joking? Unless the Kaiser\u0027s recruiting Irishmen to take out the crown, you can count me out!\"\n\n\nJoseph spits on the ground, turning and heading out of the room. Ma immediately darts up as quick as a bullet, far faster than any old woman has a right to do, heading after him to give him another smack. You chuckle as the two rush out of the room. This leaves you and your sister standing alone around the table. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re in dark times, Michael,\" Mary says to you. \"I\u0027m worried about Joseph.

You watch as the flames lick the black sky, feeling utterly helpless.\n\n\n\"Jesus,\" you mutter.\n\n\nYou watch the destruction of endless buildings, the end of dozens of businesses and the jobs from them.

  "page 140": "The 1918 Irish general elections are a shocker, but make it clear how polarized the nation is thanks to the radicalizing effect of the Easter Rising and its aftermath. Of the 105 seats the Irish people had in the House of Commons, the last election had left the main Home Rule party, the Irish Parliamentary Party, with 74 seats, with 17 going to the Irish Unionist party which sought to keep Ireland as part of Britain. The nationalist Sinn Féin did not hold a single seat.\n\n\nAfter the elections, the Irish Parliamentary Party had six seats left. The Irish Unionist Party was left with 22. Sinn Féin now held a whopping 73 seats. Led by Éamon de Valera, a prominent commander in the Easter Rising who had been spared the firing squad due to his American citizenship and the fact that Britain was hoping to get America to join in on the war, Sinn Féin had become the most prominent party in Ireland. However, their members have taken a drastic policy, refusing to attend British parliament for fear that would legitimize Britain\u0027s rule over Ireland. What they plan to do next is anyone\u0027s guess.\n\n\nNow, it\u0027s the 21st of January, 1919. Thanks to winter, there\u0027s little work to do at the farm other than maintaining the animals, so you\u0027re left with a little free time. Given that it\u0027s nearly Mary\u0027s birthday, you\u0027ve went into the city to try purchase a gift for her with Joseph. \n\n\nYou walk along the cold streets, your hands in your coat. Joseph walks alongside you. A cigarette hangs in your lips, while you listen to Joseph trying to justify his gift idea.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good for her, but it\u0027s good for the whole house! That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re being selfish, we\u0027re just being logical.\"\n\n\n\"Mary doesn\u0027t drink, Joseph. She\u0027s had a few sips, but she\u0027ll never appreciate anything worth giving as a gift.\"\n\n\n\"Well, what do you suppose?\" he asks.\n\n\nYou pass a group of young girls walking together. You tip your hat and smile at them, as they all smile respectfully back. You turn back to Joseph to continue your conversation, but your brother has a big, goofy grin on his face. \n\n\n\"She was looking at you, Michael. She seemed like she was dripping,\" he laughs.\n\n\n\"Dripping?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Yeah. You know what I mean.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, shrugging.\n\n\n\"Christ, you really haven\u0027t been with many girls. Or more accurately, any girls. She liked you, Michael. Speaking of, I\u0027ve heard there\u0027s more than a few girls are on the hunt for a man like you, you know. Katie Hales, for instance.\"\n\n\n\"The one with the face like a horse? I\u0027ll pass, Joseph.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, don\u0027t be a bollocks. Jane Garrety. She\u0027s a pretty girl, you can\u0027t argue with me there.\"\n\n\n\"Barely a personality there at all.

The accuracy in them might be what makes them so enraging.\n\n\n\"Watch your fucking tone with me,\" you growl.\" I swear to fuck, I will put your head through a fucking wall.\" \n\n\n\"Shit, sorry, sorry!\" Joseph says, raising his hands defensively. \"Didn\u0027t mean to start anything.\"\n\n\n\"Then don\u0027t,\" you say tersely.\n\n\nYou walk on for about a minute as Joseph goes silent and cowers down. Finally, he decides to break the silence again.\n\n\n\"So, shall we get the whiskey?\" Joseph asks innocently. \n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you mutter. \n\n\n\"Well, I don\u0027t hear any suggestions from you.\"\n\n\n\"Something girly. A dress, or something.\"\n\n\n\"Do you know Mary\u0027s size?\" Joseph asks, as you stare at him blankly.\n\n\n\"Ah for fuck\u0027s sake, I don\u0027t know. She\u0027s fairly small.\"\n\n\n\"I doubt \"fairly small\" is a dress size.\"\n\n\n\"Christ above, then get her a book, or a fucking c...!\"\n\n\nYou slam into another man, knocking his papers to the ground as he nearly tips backwards. You grab his wrist, keeping steady, before dropping low to gather his papers.\n\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" you apologize. \"I was distracted by my brother.\"\n\n\n\"Not a problem, my man,\" the man replies, running a hand through his dark hair and he takes the papers back from you. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s easy to be distracted when you\u0027re accompanied by such a great big fool.\"\n\n\n\"Rory O\u0027Connor! How are you doing, my fine friend?\" Joseph grins.\n\n\n\"You know each other?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Joseph and I fought together in the Easter Rising, and we were imprisoned together at Frongoch. We shared a cell.\"\n\n\n\"Fought together? Bollocks, Rory, you didn\u0027t do any fighting. You went down and were captured almost immediately.\"\n\n\n\"I was hit by a sniper on a reconnaissance mission,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says, lifting his shirt slightly to show a scar where the bullet must\u0027ve entered.\n\n\n\"No one wants to see that old scar again,\" Joseph says. \"Don\u0027t you have somewhere to be? You were in an awful hurry.\"\n\n\n\"I do indeed, I\u0027ve a lot to do, actually,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says. \"Speaking of, you could help me in that. I\u0027m on a recruitment drive.\"\n\n\n\"For what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The Irish Republican Army. We\u0027re reorganizing the Irish Volunteers, turning them into a proper fighting force. I\u0027m taking on the role of Director of Engineering.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s no republic for there to be an army to fight for,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"That changes today. The Sinn Féin politicians are getting together to found the first Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, the assembly of Ireland. We will declare an Irish republic, and with that, the IRA will have a nation to fight for. So, Joseph, will you join the IRA and fight for this newfound nation?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m in,\" Joseph says, extending his hand as the two shake hands. \"I\u0027ll happily shed my blood for this country once more.\"\n\n\n\"Delightful,\" he says, grinning, before turning to you. \"You\u0027re welcome to join as well, you know,\" \n\n\n\"I\u0027m not a soldier. I served in the Irish Volunteers, but I never fought in the Easter Rising.\"\n\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t matter in the slightest. All that matters is whether you\u0027re willing to fight now, to protect our newfound nation. Surely you long for the independence of our glorious nation? Would you consider it?\"\n",
  "page 382": "\"We hide!\" you whisper loudly, grabbing Joseph and quickly rushing into the nearest building. \n\n\nYou push through the door to a shop that\u0027s been abandoned in the chaos, smashing open the door as you find the shopkeeper thankfully left it unlocked in his desperation to escape. \n\n\n\"IRA! Come out!\" a voice screams.\n\n\n\"Stay low and quiet,\" you whisper.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not an idiot!\" Joseph replies. \n\n\n\"No one saw them escape.

No, too much risk and too time consuming,\" the first voice says. \n\n\n\"Then we burn them out.

Unfortunately, as the walls as splashed and soaked with gasoline and set alight, the building quickly erupts into flame. \n\n\nSoon, flames begin bursting through the walls of the room. You wait, hoping they\u0027ll go away, as the entire house is quickly engulfed in flames.\n\n\n\"Michael, what do we do?\" Joseph asks. \"They\u0027re waiting for us outside, they\u0027ve surrounded the whole area!

You assumed the rebels had been crushed, that their morale had been broken. \n\n\nYou couldn\u0027t be farther from the truth.\n\n\nThese men aren\u0027t broken. They\u0027re marching proudly towards the prison trucks, happy and brave. Their fighting spirit is stronger than ever. This is only the start of their plan.

He looks at you with a grin, dried blood coating the side of his face from a shrapnel hit. Serves the fucker right for beating the shit out of you that he\u0027d end up getting his face slashed open. He salutes you, before a barking soldier forces him to move on, down the street.

Her hair is slick with blood, sticking to the side of her face as it smears it red. Her face is heavily bruised from what must\u0027ve been one serious beating. Her dress is nearly torn off her, with several tears along the skirt. Tears run down her discolored cheeks, as her lip quivers from the trauma of her night. A long cut runs across her forehead, disappearing to her hairline, with a trickle of blood running down her face and soaking her hair and scap with the dark blood. Her inner thighs and legs are slick with blood and... you grimace, as Mary stares at you with a distant, deadened look.\n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you say. \"Ma! Joseph! Get down here!\"\n\n\nYou rush over to her, wrapping her up as she presses her face into the the nook of your neck and shoulder. Ma and Joseph arrive on scene. Ma lets out a horrified shriek, running over to her daughter and giving her a tight hug as you step back.\n\n\n\"Oh my dear God, sweet God above, what\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened? What\u0027s happened you?\" \n\n\n\"I... I was walking home, and he attacked me,\" she says in between sobs. \n\n\n\"Who?

I admittedly wasn\u0027t a big nationalist back then, but that tendency has grown, clearly,\" he nods. \"Anyway, I hitched a ride here with a cart and carriage carrying a few men. How many are you expecting?\"\n\n\n\"Nineteen men, myself included,\" Fionn says.\n\n\n\"Perfect. More than enough men to do what needs to be done. Now, it\u0027s best to keep drilling to night, and as quietly as can be, but this\u0027ll do for now. I\u0027m in a bit of a hurry.

Hardly a Catholic surname. Are you a Protestant?\"\n\n\n\"That a problem?\" Sean asks.\n\n\n\"Of course not. Wolfe Tone was a proper Irish patriot, and he was Protestant. There\u0027s rumors that the IRA are a Catholic supremacy organization, but that\u0027s a load of drivel. We want equal rights for Catholics and Protestants. We want nothing more ,and we\u0027ll take nothing else.\"\n\n\nErnie O\u0027Malley turns to you two again, nodding.\n\n\n\"And you two?\"\n\n\n\"Joseph McCarthy.

A shame we don\u0027t have a British uniform to stuff it in. Anyone care to be the example?\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re shoved forward by Joseph, as Ernie grins, handing you the rifle.\n\n\n\"All yours, Michael.

  "page 156": "The 1918 Irish general elections are a shocker, but make it clear how polarized the nation is thanks to the radicalizing effect of the Easter Rising and its aftermath. Of the 105 seats the Irish people had in the House of Commons, the last election had left the main Home Rule party, the Irish Parliamentary Party, with 74 seats, with 17 going to the Irish Unionist party which sought to keep Ireland as part of Britain. The nationalist Sinn Féin did not hold a single seat.\n\n\nAfter the elections, the Irish Parliamentary Party had six seats left. The Irish Unionist Party was left with 22. Sinn Féin now held a whopping 73 seats. Led by Éamon de Valera, a prominent commander in the Easter Rising who had been spared the firing squad due to his American citizenship and the fact that Britain was hoping to get America to join in on the war, Sinn Féin had become the most prominent party in Ireland. However, their members have taken a drastic policy, refusing to attend British parliament for fear that would legitimize Britain\u0027s rule over Ireland. What they plan to do next is anyone\u0027s guess.\n\n\nNow, it\u0027s the 21st of January, 1919. Thanks to winter, there\u0027s little work to do at the farm other than maintaining the animals, so you\u0027re left with a little free time. Given that it\u0027s nearly Mary\u0027s birthday, you\u0027ve went into the city to try purchase a gift for her with Joseph. \n\n\nYou walk along the cold streets, your hands in your coat. Joseph walks alongside you. A cigarette hangs in your lips, while you listen to Joseph trying to justify his gift idea.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good for her, but it\u0027s good for the whole house! That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re being selfish, we\u0027re just being logical.\"\n\n\n\"Mary doesn\u0027t drink, Joseph. She\u0027s had a few sips, but she\u0027ll never appreciate anything worth giving as a gift.\"\n\n\n\"Well, what do you suppose?\" he asks.\n\n\nYou pass a group of young girls walking together. You tip your hat and smile at them, as they all smile respectfully back. You turn back to Joseph to continue your conversation, but your brother has a big, goofy grin on his face. \n\n\n\"She was looking at you, Michael. She seemed like she was dripping,\" he laughs.\n\n\n\"Dripping?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Yeah. You know what I mean.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, shrugging.\n\n\n\"Christ, you really haven\u0027t been with many girls. Or more accurately, any girls. She liked you, Michael.

Finally, he decides to break the silence again.\n\n\n\"So, shall we get the whiskey?\" Joseph asks innocently. \n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you mutter. \n\n\n\"Well, I don\u0027t hear any suggestions from you.\"\n\n\n\"Something girly.

How are you doing, my fine friend?\" Joseph grins.\n\n\n\"You know each other?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Joseph and I fought together in the Easter Rising, and we were imprisoned together at Frongoch. We shared a cell.\"\n\n\n\"Fought together? Bollocks, Rory, you didn\u0027t do any fighting. You went down and were captured almost immediately.\"\n\n\n\"I was hit by a sniper on a reconnaissance mission,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says, lifting his shirt slightly to show a scar where the bullet must\u0027ve entered.\n\n\n\"No one wants to see that old scar again,\" Joseph says. \"Don\u0027t you have somewhere to be? You were in an awful hurry.\"\n\n\n\"I do indeed, I\u0027ve a lot to do, actually,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says. \"Speaking of, you could help me in that. I\u0027m on a recruitment drive.\"\n\n\n\"For what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The Irish Republican Army. We\u0027re reorganizing the Irish Volunteers, turning them into a proper fighting force. I\u0027m taking on the role of Director of Engineering.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s no republic for there to be an army to fight for,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"That changes today. The Sinn Féin politicians are getting together to found the first Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, the assembly of Ireland. We will declare an Irish republic, and with that, the IRA will have a nation to fight for. So, Joseph, will you join the IRA and fight for this newfound nation?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m in,\" Joseph says, extending his hand as the two shake hands. \"I\u0027ll happily shed my blood for this country once more.\"\n\n\n\"Delightful,\" he says, grinning, before turning to you. \"You\u0027re welcome to join as well, you know,\" \n\n\n\"I never was an Irish Volunteer. In fact, I served the crown in the Great War, in the Royal Army.\"\n\n\n\"Then you have experience fighting,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says. \"We could use that, without a doubt we could use that. Would you consider it?\"\n",
  "page 398": "\"We force a surrender,\" you say. \"No need to kill them when we can just as easily capture them. Liam, Ronan, move to the left flank. Conor, Edward, right flank. Give them the idea that they\u0027re surrounded.\"\n\n\nThe other two forces begin moving off to the flanks slowly, before you give the signal to push up. As you edge closer, you finally hold up a fist, before rising so you, and more importantly, your rifle, are more visible.\n\n\n\"Hands in the air!\" you order with a barking shout. \"You\u0027re outnumbered and outgunned!\"\n\n\nThe first soldier frantically tries to draw his rifle, but instead, drops it by accident. The second pauses, before slowly lowering his rifle, tossing it to the ground as he holds up his hands.\n\n\n\"We surrender! Don\u0027t shoot!\" one of the soldiers says.\n\n\nThe other one raises his hands, although more sternly, a look of anger on his face. \n\n\n\"Keep your guns aimed at them,\" you say. \"Joseph and I will retrieve their rifles.\"\n\n\nYou begin moving down to the road, rifles raised to make sure the soldiers don\u0027t try anything. You quickly take their rifles, staring up at them. Joseph begins to tie up the hands of one of them, while you go for the other.\n\n\n\"You are now prisoners of war of the Irish Republic,\" you say. \"For the best you surrendered. We had half a dozen rifles on you.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve been taken prisoner. I didn\u0027t surrender,\" the soldier says, determined.\n\n\n\"It sure seems like you did,\" you say, gesturing to his hands.\n\n\nYou grab his wrist, pulling it behind his back and you begin binding his hands together.\n\n\n\"You can only surrender to a foreign army. There\u0027s no army here, only a bunch of traitors to the crown and terrorists.\"\n\n\nYou punch the man in the back of the head, dropping him to his knees.\n\n\n\"Good to know. Well, let\u0027s get you out of that uniform.\"\n\n\nYou take the cap form the officer, popping it on your head. You unbutton the man\u0027s trousers in an admittedly awkward time, before pulling off his boots. You pull off his trousers, before you finally struggle to take off the jacket, removing his bindings temporarily before you tie him up again. Thankfully, he doesn\u0027t try anything, and neither does Joseph\u0027s prisoner. \n\n\nYou pull the jacket on, before removing the man\u0027s boots and trousers. It\u0027s not long before you\u0027re fully dressed, as is Joseph. You nod to other three soldiers.\n\n\n\"OK, I\u0027m finished. Take these prisoners out and find somewhere to hide them out of view. Then, leave a man guarding them and have the other two join up with Team 2.\"\n\n\nThe other soldiers nod, pulling the prisoners up and quickly leading them away. You turn to Joseph, who grins at you, looking spiff and span in his pristine uniform.\n\n\n\"How do I look? Charming?\" Joseph smiles.\n\n\n\"Yeah, you look fine. How about mine?\"\n\n\n\"Nah, you look perfect. We should be fine.\"\n\n\nYou stand by the road as the ambush position is set up, as you patiently wait as the rest of the unit dumps the bodies off in a field and sets up the ambush.\n\n\nAfter about an hour, the two weapons transports begin approaching. Two trucks filled with a mixture of soldiers and weaponry. You wait patiently, as the truck begins approaching. You stand by the road, holding up a hand to motion for them to stop.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re slowing down,\" Joseph says. \"Thank Christ.\"\n\n\nYou pause, wondering what\u0027s going on as a mixture of emotions crosses the front driver\u0027s face. The truck stops slowing down, although it doesn\u0027t speed up either. You stand straight and continue gesturing, trying to stay calm and casual.\n\n\n\"They might\u0027ve noticed something,\" Joseph says. \"Stay calm or hit now?\" \n",

The truck drives forward as the driver attempts to speed off, having a brief moment where you\u0027re the only person shooting at him. The bullets bounce off the car side, the window shattering, but they don\u0027t slow down. The truck drives forward, slamming into you as you\u0027re sent spiraling down the street.

Your body crunches as the heavy truck rolls straight over you, as you\u0027re killed in such a brutal manner.\n",
  "page 159": "The 1918 Irish general elections are a shocker, but make it clear how polarized the nation is thanks to the radicalizing effect of the Easter Rising and its aftermath. Of the 105 seats the Irish people had in the House of Commons, the last election had left the main Home Rule party, the Irish Parliamentary Party, with 74 seats, with 17 going to the Irish Unionist party which sought to keep Ireland as part of Britain. The nationalist Sinn Féin did not hold a single seat.\n\n\nAfter the elections, the Irish Parliamentary Party had six seats left. The Irish Unionist Party was left with 22. Sinn Féin now held a whopping 73 seats. Led by Éamon de Valera, a prominent commander in the Easter Rising who had been spared the firing squad due to his American citizenship and the fact that Britain was hoping to get America to join in on the war, Sinn Féin had become the most prominent party in Ireland. However, their members have taken a drastic policy, refusing to attend British parliament for fear that would legitimize Britain\u0027s rule over Ireland. What they plan to do next is anyone\u0027s guess.\n\n\nNow, it\u0027s the 21st of January, 1919. Thanks to winter, there\u0027s little work to do at the farm other than maintaining the animals, so you\u0027re left with a little free time.

Joseph walks alongside you. A cigarette hangs in your lips, while you listen to Joseph trying to justify his gift idea.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good for her, but it\u0027s good for the whole house! That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re being selfish, we\u0027re just being logical.\"\n\n\n\"Mary doesn\u0027t drink, Joseph. She\u0027s had a few sips, but she\u0027ll never appreciate anything worth giving as a gift.\"\n\n\n\"Well, what do you suppose?\" he asks.\n\n\nYou pass a group of young girls walking together. You tip your hat and smile at them, as they all smile respectfully back. You turn back to Joseph to continue your conversation, but your brother has a big, goofy grin on his face. \n\n\n\"She was looking at you, Michael. She seemed like she was dripping,\" he laughs.\n\n\n\"Dripping?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Yeah. You know what I mean.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, shrugging.\n\n\n\"Christ, you really haven\u0027t been with many girls. Or more accurately, any girls. She liked you, Michael. Speaking of, I\u0027ve heard there\u0027s more than a few girls are on the hunt for a man like you, you know. Katie Hales, for instance.\"\n\n\n\"The one with the face like a horse? I\u0027ll pass, Joseph.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, don\u0027t be a bollocks. Jane Garrety. She\u0027s a pretty girl, you can\u0027t argue with me there.\"\n\n\n\"Barely a personality there at all. I\u0027d sooner marry horse-face.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re an awful man. There must be some woman you like.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, as Joseph groans in frustration.\n\n\n\"You know, maybe those rumors are true, for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027ve heard the rumors before, and this. The accuracy in them might be what makes them so enraging.\n\n\n\"Watch your fucking tone with me,\" you growl.\" I swear to fuck, I will put your head through a fucking wall.\" \n\n\n\"Shit, sorry, sorry!\" Joseph says, raising his hands defensively. \"Didn\u0027t mean to start anything.\"\n\n\n\"Then don\u0027t,\" you say tersely.\n\n\nYou walk on for about a minute as Joseph goes silent and cowers down.

You can\u0027t carry a rifle around in public, but you need protection. Thus, you have a pistol concealed somewhere.\"\n\n\nErnie cracks a smile, nodding, as he draws a pistol from his coat. He takes the rifle with one hand, offering you his pistol in the other. You grab the pistol, hefting the weight of it in your hands. A simple revolver, simple but powerful. You check to make sure it\u0027s loaded, and it is. You slide it into your coat pocket, before you pluck the pipe from Ernie\u0027s mouth.\n\n\n\"Matches?\" you ask for, putting the pipe in your mouth. \n\n\nErnie gives you a box of matches, staring at you curiously. You take the matches, and casually begin walking towards the scarecrow, trying to light the match. The other volunteers slowly slowly follow, as you calmly work forward. You light the match as you grow nearer. You begin burning the tobacco as you inhale slowly, walking straight past the scarecrow. As soon as you\u0027re behind him, you casually reach into your coat pocket, hurrying to draw your pistol. You quickly raise it, pointing it at the back of the scarecrow\u0027s head and pulling the trigger as it\u0027s head explodes.\n\n\n\"Impressive,\" Ernie says, grinning. \"He didn\u0027t see you coming, you were so close you didn\u0027t miss. One of the most casual killings ever. It was a bloody assassination.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll need a new scarecrow,\" Fionn complains.\n\n\n\"That is true,\" Ernie says. \"I suppose this is a good lesson on how easy it can be to assassinate a man. However...\"\n\n\nErnie reaches forward, plucking the pipe out of your mouth.\n\n\n\"Never takes a man\u0027s pipe, Michael,\" Ernie says. \"Now, let\u0027s try focus on a potential ambush position. Let\u0027s continue your streak, Michael. You\u0027re trying to ambush a convoy going down a long road with plenty of cover. You have, let\u0027s say... eight riflemen. How do you space them out?\" \n",
  "page 299": "You turn, rushing towards your pistol as quickly as you can. The man you were beating up tackles you to the ground, as you smack into the wooden floor with a painful thud. The man forces his knees onto your arms, struggling to pin you down with his weight. One of the other soldiers quickly arrives with his rifle, standing over you.\n\n\n\"Hold him steady!\" he shouts.\n\n\n\"I am!\" the soldier replies through gritted teeth.\n\n\n\"Fucking cunts!\" you yell, struggling to push the soldier from off you. \n\n\n\"Hold him steady!\" the man shouts again, as the gun barrel is aimed at your face. \n\n\nYou stare down the gun barrel, taking a deep breath as you try to force the man off you in desperation. The man pulls the trigger, ending your struggle.\n",
  "page 177": "You nod, dropping down to the floor, lying flat, where you\u0027re obscured by the long grass. You slowly begin to press forward, crawling along the ground as you raise your rifle, aiming it ahead.

You\u0027re crawling through dirt, destroying\n\n\nThe men chuckle, as you continue to crawl ahead through the muck and the grime.\n\n\n\"Laugh all you want, but this is a true killer, a true patriot, a true soldier,\" Ernie says.\n\n\nYou continue crawling, until you\u0027re close enough that you can definitely make the shot. You raise your rifle, aiming down the sights at your target, before you pull the trigger. With that, the scarecrow\u0027s chest explodes in a burst of straw and hay as three rounds burst through its chest.\n\n\n\"Impressive,\" Ernie says, grinning. \"Good shot, a good call getting in close to deal with, all around impressive.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll need a new scarecrow,\" Fionn complains.\n\n\n\"That is true,\" Ernie says. \"Observe his shooting position, men, he\u0027s a good shot. Practice often, and you\u0027ll be able to shoot the button\u0027s of a Constabulary\u0027s coat.\"\n\n\nErnie walks up to the scarecrow, giving it\u0027s button eyes a gentle flick as he smiles to himself.\n\n\n\"Now, let\u0027s try focus on a potential ambush position.

You scream out in pain, grabbing at your leg with a desperate scream. \n\n\nThe next punch is from the man you\u0027ve been beating, as he knocks your head backwards, as your blood squirts over the floor. Immediately, all three of them are upon you, as boots begin to smash into you. You\u0027re quickly stomped several times in the head, your blood and teeth spilling out onto the floor. When they finally stop, you\u0027re too broken and bloodied to even know what\u0027s happening. All you hear is the pulling back of a rifle bolt, and then it all ends.\n",
  "page 179": "You drop down to you knee, crouching with the other leg as you raise your rifle to your shoulder, cocking your head to stare down the iron sights as you train your gun barrel onto the scarecrow. You take a deep breath, focusing slowly.

The second shot hits the soil just to the left of the scarecrow, shooting up dust.

Until then, we\u0027re using weapons borrowed from Liam Lynch and the No. 2 Cork Brigade. We\u0027re going to hit in the formation discussed, and wipe out the convoy. I\u0027ll be taking the ten best shots here, so let\u0027s get to work and show me what you can do.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the day is spent drilling and going over tactics, as well as O\u0027Malley and the locals establishing the various levels fo support held for them among all the various locals. Various safe houses and villages with high nationalist tendencies, as well as areas with a high unionist presence that are likely to be filled with informants. The locations of various RIC barracks and where the presence of the British army is strongest, as well as the area that this branch was expected to deal with, a large section of outer and rural Dublin. It\u0027s going to be hard work, and you\u0027re under-supplied, under-armed and under-supported, but most importantly, you\u0027re underestimated. The Crown think the problem in Ireland is a bunch of peasants mucking about in their pigsties, trying to rise up without knowing what they\u0027re doing. \n\n\nThey\u0027ll learn never to underestimate an Irishman.\n",

Joseph, do you stand by your brother\u0027s opinion?\"\n\n\nJoseph nods.\n\n\n\"Well then, we\u0027re decided. We attack. Assemble the troops.\"\n\n\nYou quickly assemble the troops, preparing them for an assault. The rescued prisoners are organized into groups and armed, as you hurry to move your forces out there to eliminate the Free State soldiers before this battle can even begin.\n\n\nYou find the Free State soldiers on the outskirts of the town, the Free State soldiers attempt to organize, setting up their long-range field guns to provide some artillery in the assault on the town, while setting up ammo reserves and first aid centers to take the wounded to. They\u0027re in no way ready for your quick, fast-paced attack and you fall upon them with gusto.\n\n\nHowever, the battle quickly turns to chaos. Without an organized plan, and the lack of fluidity in action that comes from trying to bring men from across the country into an army in such a small period of time, your IRA forces quickly break up and fall into chaos. The Free State soldiers, taken by surprise and still somewhat disorganized, are left in a desperate panic as well. This isn\u0027t helped by the fact many of you know men on the other side, leading to an unwillingness to partake in the brutality necessary to swiftly win a battle.\n\n\nThe battle becomes a bizarre combat, as soldiers break lines and break into melees, while others retreat, try to surrender, or do anything they can in this awful attempt at combat. The battle swiftly turns to hell, as you\u0027re left desperately trying to organize something, anything, out of the miserable chaos of the battle.\n\n\nIn the general chaos are both forces try to organize, a Free State rifleman manages to get a clear shot at one of the IRA leaders desperately trying to organize their men. He raises his rifle, staring down the iron sights as he lets out a quiet prayer for the soul he\u0027s about to send to God, before finally pulling the trigger. \n\n\nThe shot bursts straight through your chest, as you stumble forward for a meek few steps. You let out a pained gasp for air, before your strength is sapped and your legs give way, and you collapse to the ground, death quickly taking you.\n",
  "page 400": "You raise your rifle, opening fire. You drop to a knee, raising your rifle as you aim ahead, trying to get a shot in at the driver to stop the truck and block up the road. You press the butt of the rifle against your shoulder, tilting your head and staring straight down the iron sights.\n\n\nHowever, attacking this early leaves the trucks out of the firing range, and also in raising your gun and firing, it actually takes a moment for the other IRA soldiers to realize you\u0027ve changed the signal. The truck drives forward as the driver attempts to speed off, having a brief moment where you\u0027re the only person shooting at him. The bullets bounce off the car side, the window shattering, but they don\u0027t slow down. The truck drives forward, slamming into you as you\u0027re sent spiraling down the street. You bounce against the hard ground, rolling along, before the truck continues driving. Your body crunches as the heavy truck rolls straight over you, as you\u0027re killed in such a brutal manner.\n",
  "page 521": "You walk with Joseph and an IRA volunteer, who shares the lovely name Michael with you, down the busy streets of Cork by Dillon\u0027s Coss. Across from you, walking in the same direction, is commander Seán O\u0027Donoghue, Seán O\u0027Donoghue wears the uniform of an off-duty British officer. You try to avoid looking at him to avoid drawing attention to him and thus the many imperfections in his disguise that could get him caught and killed.\n\n\nThe plan is simple. Two lorries of Auxilaries should be coming down the road, transporting Captain James Kelly, your target. You\u0027re outnumbered and in a busy city center, so you\u0027re going to have to work hard to win, especially since you\u0027ll be trying to minimize civilian casualties, while the Auxilaries won\u0027t necessarily be trying to do the same. Plus, thanks to the fact you\u0027re in a city, you\u0027re not well armed, instead armed with revolvers hidden on your persons, as well as a grenade each, also hidden on your person. \n\n\nSeán O\u0027Donoghue stops, leaning against the wall of a pub and lighting a cigarette. You quickly move behind a waist-high stone wall with Joseph, finding another two soldiers low down against the wall there. You move next to them, crouching low so you\u0027re hidden from the street view. The last soldier in your six man crew stands next to you, leaning against the wall casually. As you can\u0027t see the road of Seán O\u0027Donoghue, you\u0027re to wait for his signal. Sean O\u0027Donoghue is to slow the head lorry down, and then you strike.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re coming,\" the man against the wall says, staring at the road.\n\n\n\"Hello there, officers!\" you hear Sean O\u0027Donoghue say.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s do this,\" the man leaning against the wall, rising his pistol. \n\n\nYou rise up to see a pair of lorries slowing down in the street. Your comrades release a volley of grenades. Surprisingly, most miss, bouncing off harmlessly against the sides of the truck. One lucky throw lands in the second grenade, going off and immediately disabling the drunk in a burst of smoke as men frantically get out of the vehicle.\n",
  "page 642": "\"We organize a truce, like you said. That seems like the best way forward. If we\u0027ve freed the prisoners and taken the arms, we\u0027ve done all this mission had to accomplish. If we can end it without any further bloodshed, that\u0027s even better.\"\n\n\n\"So then, if the majority of us support that, it seems like a reasonable decision. Joseph, do you stand by your brother\u0027s opinion?\"\n\n\nJoseph nods.\n\n\n\"Damn straight I do. I\u0027m just glad to see him again.\"\n\n\n\"Well then, we\u0027re decided. We try organize the troops. Meanwhile, prepare for a defense in case they refuse our terms.\"\n\n\nYou quickly assemble the troops, mostly taking control of the Republican prisoners you\u0027ve come to know, preparing them for a defense, while Frank Aiken sends out an unarmed messenger to offer terms to the Free State. The terms are simple: the IRA forces be allowed to retreat with the prisoners captured, which you sure as hell were adamant about keeping in there, given how shit sick you are of prison food,and the arms taken, in exchange for allowing the Free State to retake the town, as well as releasing the Free State prisoners that have been captured in the taking of the town. There\u0027s a long, desperate and nerve-wracking wait, as you prepare for the Free State\u0027s response. \n\n\nAfter about an hour of waiting, the messenger finally returns. Frank Aiken, you, Joseph and Aiken\u0027s lieutenants assemble around him.\n\n\n\"What did he say?\" Frank Aiken asks.\n\n\n\"They said if they have your word that their men will be released, and that there will be no attempt at sabotaging the town or leaving behind traps for the Free State soldiers who take back the town, then it\u0027s agreed, and you can begin evacuating the town.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" Frank Aiken says, a relieved smile flashing across his face. \"Let\u0027s begin the evacuation as soon as we can.\"\n\n\nYou begin to organize the transport of the captured arms out of the barracks in a few trucks captured out back, as you organize the released Republican soldiers. You leave the captured Free State soldiers in the cells they once imprisoned your comrades. With that, you begin a slow, nervous evacuation of the town, retreating to the countryside where you can disperse and escape with your captured spoils. As you sit in the passenger seat of a truck laden with captured rifles, you nervously wait, terrified of the Free State going against their word and attacking, which with the element of surprise and the use of artillery, they could easily wipe you out. Thankfully, though they make no such attempt, and you quickly escape out into the countryside. \n\n\n\"A successful operation,\" Frank Aiken says. \"What\u0027s that breath of free air like?\"\n\n\n\"Beautiful,\" you grin, leaning back as you relax. \"Thank God I\u0027m out. Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ll get you home to Dublin to see your family, Michael,\" Frank Aiken says.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you sigh in relief, as the truck full of arms and released prisoners rolls free of the town.\n",
  "page 520": "You travel with Joseph to Fionn\u0027s, where he secures you with a letter to head down to Cork. The two of you quickly head to Cork, where you meet with the leaders of the IRA forces down there: Liam Lynch, Tom Barry and Sean O\u0027Donoghue. They organize a room down with another IRA volunteer by the name of Brendan, who you vaguely recognize from the rising. In exchange for helping out with the farm, you get free room and board from him. Although you try to avoid it, the fact that you\u0027ve already killed your fair share of Black and Tans and the fact that you harbor a special hatred for them means it\u0027s not long before you start assisting in ambushes as a scout. Plus, you have a lot of respect from the lads thanks to having fought in the Easter Rising and since you were imprisoned in Frongoch. Then, you quickly join the ranks of the riflemen, and it\u0027s not long before you\u0027re a soldier of necessity in the IRA. With the way the British treat the people of Ireland, it\u0027s unexpected. You quickly get involved with the IRA down there, organizing drilling, training and ambushes alongside the vast rebel forces down there.\n\n\nFor the battle of independence, the war gets worst, especially for Cork. In March, the Mayor of Cork is murdered by a group of Black and Tans.  In response to increased internment, Munster and Cork get especially violent. 24 prisoners of war are hung by the British, and Sean Tracey, the man who started this all, is killed in Dublin. In August, Terence MacSwiney, the new Mayor of Cork, dies on a hunger strike, attracting vast international attention.\n\n\nWhen November rolls around, the violence only continues. On the 21st, Bloody Sunday happens. Michael Collins and the Squad, his anti-spy squad, assassinate 14 undercover British Intelligence officers in a single day. In a reprisal attack, the British forces attack a Dublin v Tipperary football match, killing indiscriminately, killing twelve people including one of the goalies. Two prisoners of war and an innocent man are executed at Dublin Castle in addition to this, purely as acts of spite against the entire Irish people. This event is known as Bloody Sunday.\n\n\nIt\u0027s late November now, only a few days after Bloody Sunday and you\u0027re down in Cork. You sit in a small room Brendan\u0027s farmhouse in Cork, discussing matters with a group of other IRA soldiers. Liam Lynch, a small, bespectacled man you\u0027d normally look over, stands at the center of attention, commanding the entire group.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re low on arms, low on manpower and all-around we\u0027re doing worse than we can. Fighting this war is going to be tough,\" Liam Lynch admits.\n\n\n\"If we quiet down on the ambushes and go underground while doubling our recruitment efforts, we can make up our numbers in no times,\" Tom Barry, a young commander with a mess of black hair suggests.\n\n\n\"Not a chance in hell, Tom. If we reduce attacks, the British will think they can quash out the rebellion here. If they subdue Munster, if they take Cork, this rebellion will falter here as badly as in Ulster. Connaught will be a mop up, and with that, their focus on Dublin will wipe us out completely.\"\n\n\n\"Then what do you suggest?\"\n\n\n\"We attack. We double-down, and hit hard and fast. Make sure those Brits understand that this isn\u0027t going to be easy for them. I\u0027ve already lined up two targets. Tom, I want you to head to Kilmichael shortly, to set up an ambush. It\u0027ll happen a week after the Sunday Massacre. You\u0027re to hit a group of Auxiliaries, around eighteen men. I\u0027ll give you twice that. I want this group blown out of the fucking water. Make sure the Brits know who is fighting this war.\"\n\n\n\"Aye. There\u0027ll be no survivors,\" Tom Barry nods.\n\n\nThe plan for Kilmichael actually represents a serious change in the IRA method of waging war. Rather than small, occasional ambushes from locals, the IRA has began organizing flying columns of soldiers, permanently mobile units of soldiers that stay at various safe-houses to rest and resupply to avoid capture, while hitting hard, aggressive attacks. It\u0027s a show of total war, thanks to the escalation in violence the Black and Tans caused.\n\n\n\"The second ambush I\u0027m planning is a bit more distant. In early December, I plan to capture or kill Army Intelligence Corps Captain James Kelly, to put a face to this slaughter. A simple six man unit hits their lorry, killing their men with grenades and sweeping through the survivors with rifle. Understood?\"\n\n\n\"Whose to lead it?\" a voice asks.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll give that to Seán O\u0027Donoghue.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" Seán O\u0027Donoghue says. \"We\u0027ll get the target.\"\n\n\n\"Good, good,\" Liam Lynch says, handing out two lists of names to either chosen commander. \"These are your men.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve a problem,\" Seán O\u0027Donghue says. \"Two of my men, Paddy Trahey and Patrick Donohue, were killed Tuesday by a Black and Tan. He snuck into a meeting wearing civilian clothes and killed them with a grenade, alongside Seamus Mehigan.\"\n\n\n\"Bollocks. Take the Dubliners. Dubliners, are you free? Mick, do you finally consider yourself one of us, or are you still a blessed, holier than thou pacifist?\" Liam Lynch says, getting a few laughs.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll fight. I\u0027ll happily kill more than any man here, especially you,\" you retort.\n\n\n\"No man would be happier than me if I heard you\u0027d gunned down a dozen Black and Tans, Mick. Joseph, same for you?\"\n\n\n\"Aye, commander. We\u0027ll be free,\" Joseph says.\n\n\nLiam Lynch nods, looking down at his notes.\n\n\n\"Good, good. Or... I suppose I could switch you with Dennis and Lordan, if you\u0027d rather head out earlier to Kilmichael. Seeing as I\u0027ll have to shift names around either way, it\u0027s your choice.\"\n",

Joseph, do you stand by your brother\u0027s opinion?\"\n\n\nJoseph nods.\n\n\n\"Well then, we\u0027re decided. We fortify and defend Dundalk. Assemble the troops, and let\u0027s set this place up for a siege..\"\n\n\nYou quickly assemble the troops, preparing them for the defensive of the town. Barricades are hastily erected, houses fortified into defensive outposts, prisoners armed and organized into garrisons to defend the various sections. Thankfully, you have more than enough time to set up the defense, and you\u0027re left waiting to repel the Free State soldiers.\n\n\nThere\u0027s a few small engagement with British patrols, but the main force don\u0027t arrive. You\u0027re left patiently waiting there, poised to strike as soon as they arrive, but they don\u0027t. \n\n\nOf course, when the first artillery shell tears through a nearby building, you realize why. You\u0027d counted on the fact that there are civilians to discourage the use of artillery, but it seems the Free State is more desperate to bring this thing to a close than you thought. They\u0027re armed with heavy fielder cannons, and as soon as they begin their barrage, you realize what a huge mistake you\u0027ve done.\n\n\nThe next shot tears throwing the street outside, sending chunks of pavement flying. You desperately dive for cover inside a house, as the next shot hits the house directly, sending it\u0027s weakened foundations crumbling as the building collapses in on top of you. You barely have time for a terrified scream as you\u0027re buried under a mountain of rubble, debris, concrete and rebar building your tomb.\n",

You\u0027re left secure, as the enemy falls back, leaving you with a night\u0027s peace. Of course, that\u0027s what you think, until the shelling begins anew, as the British decide on that tactic instead of fighting. Connolly survives, but is badly wounded, and left unable to walk.

With that done, you head inside the large house. You move inside, staring around at a large hallway. You move over to the counter, scraping off a mixture of old English pounds and freshly printed Irish notes and stuffing them into your pocket. Joseph takes off his rucksack, beginning to pile expensive, fancy silverware into the bag. You \n\n\n\"There should be jewelry upstairs in the master bedroom. Let\u0027s try hurry this, though,\" Joseph says. \"We don\u0027t have a lot of time before McGarry comes home.\"\n\n\nYou quickly head upstairs, rushing up the staircase and moving straight into the master bedroom. It\u0027s a large enough room, a bit luxurious for a public servant. You move to the bedside counter, pulling it open as you search through the drawers. Eventually, you manage to find a drawer filled with woman\u0027s jewelry, a fancy man\u0027s watch and a pair of handsome and expensive looking silver cufflinks. You take it all, sliding it into your pocket, before stepping away from the bed \n\n\nYou move out, your pockets jangling with jewelry as you head down the stairs. However, just as you begin moving down the stairs, you pause, hearing a rustling nearby in one of the rooms, although it could\u0027ve easily been your imagination. \n\n\n\"Come on! We\u0027re in a hurry to do this before McGarry and his family shows up and we all get shot to shit! Stop searching through a massive house before we get caught!\" Joseph cries from downstairs. \n",
  "page 524": "You rush over to the window, grabbing Connolly\u0027s rifle. You look to the woman sitting next to him, reloading the second rifle.\n\n\n\"We keep firing! If they get in, we\u0027re all fucked!\"\n\n\nShe nods determined, as you quickly get to work. \n\n\nYou quickly begin firing, and swapping your rifle with the woman, but you realize why Connolly changed shooting position and exposed himself. Standing in cover means you barely have any field of view, and you can only fire down at a few of the soldiers, but it\u0027s mostly weak shots as you can\u0027t position yourself right. In order to get a better shot, you need to kind of change position, half-hanging out the window in order to fight and force back the enemy.\n",

Connolly needs a medic!\" a voice cries behind you. \n\n\nYou fire your rifle, swapping it again as you raise the rifle, aiming down the iron sights again. You lean in, pressing your eye against the rifle, and pulling the trigger. Shots begin pinging off the stone window frame around you, before you swap your rifle again, grabbing another rifle. You aim again, firing as the bullet thuds into the paved street below, the bullet bouncing off the ground as you nearly hit a soldier charging down the street.\n\n\nSuddenly, a bullet slams into your chest, as you\u0027re shot in the chest, sent fumbling out of the window with a pained scream.

Immediately, a volley of shots goes off as you dive behind cover with Joseph, the two of you raising your rifles. You open fire, as the two driver\u0027s are killed by dozens of bullets. You raise your rifle, joining your gunfire into the massacre. They\u0027re quickly surrounded and gunned down, the soldiers barely managing to climb out of their trucks before they\u0027re shot and killed. Within a minute of fighting, the battle is over, and you\u0027re the victors.\n\n\n\"Alright!\" you shout. \"Push forward, men! Capture the trucks so we can get these arms.\"\n\n\nToday is victory, without a doubt. You\u0027ve secured a shipment of arms, eliminated a British convoy and even taken a pair of prisoners, even if you\u0027ll have to release them due to your mobile nature and lack of actual territory to build prisons for them.

  "page 631": "Over the next few months, the treaty war gets more and more out of hand, spiraling out of control. It\u0027s not long before it becomes clear that the IRA are losing, and the Free State are soon going to triumph.\n\n\nHowever, like every war, there are casualties. Arthur Griffith, overworked and strained from constant stress in keeping the government running smoothly while keeping Britain appeased, dies from heart failure leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Only ten days later, at Béal na Bláth, Michael Collins is assassinated in an IRA ambush, where he is the only loss.\n\n\nAfter losing two great leaders, the Free State becomes far more draconian in it\u0027s work in ending this whole blasted war., including performing executions without trials, larger scale internment and the criminalization of holding any arms whatsoever. This leads to the execution of Erskine Childers, the man who first ran guns for the Irish Volunteers, after he was found with a pistol that he claimed was a gift form Michael Collins. As the war gets more brutal, it becomes clear Ireland as a nation will not last unless this comes to an end soon.\n\n\nIn an attempt to influence the political background here, you\u0027ve been ordered to head down to the house of adamant pro-Treaty TD Seán McGarry. Whilst he\u0027s away on business leaving the house unoccupied, you\u0027re to set fire to the place and burn it down to the ground, to hopefully scare the TD into ending his support for the treaty. \n\n\nYou drive a small truck down the back road to McGarry\u0027s large country house. Like you were told, the place is empty, with no cars out front. You pull over, clambering out of the car to grab the two big cannisters of gasoline in the back.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get to work, then,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You know,\" Joseph suggests. \"We could rob this place before we burn it down. You know, take out a few valuables. They\u0027d be destroyed anyway...\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re professionals,\" you say. \"We should just be burning this place down, not looting like criminals.\"\n\n\n\"No one would know.\"\n\n\n\"Joseph!\"\n\n\n\"Oh, damn it! Seriously?\" he asks. \"God, you\u0027re too professional.\"\n",
  "page 752": "With the final sweep of the IRA-controlled territory, the Free State regains control of the country. The IRA fighters move into a guerrilla phase, performing ambushes, assassinating key Free State leaders and bombing infrastructure. Still, the fact that the anti-Treaty forces have far less support than the original IRA in their fight against the British, means that the anti-Treaty forces can\u0027t survive with this guerrilla warfare like you once did.  Frank Aiken is nearly captured, with the Quinn brothers, his lieutenants being killed or captured. Frank Aiken manages to escape, although little more than a week later he calls a cease fire in an attempt to minimize the death and destruction from his new position of leadership in the IRA.\n\n\nThe month after has little fighting, mostly just waiting, as you patiently wonder what\u0027s to happen. Due to the fractured nature of the IRA, many continue fighting despite the ceasefire, although the violence is hugely decreased, and you personally don\u0027t see any action against these remaining groups. Then, Frank Aiken gives the order. \"Dump arms, and return home\". It\u0027s that simple. Toss your rifle aside and go home, and the war is over. With that, your enemy is defeated. Eamon DeValera supports this move, sending out the following message: \"Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic\". It\u0027s a spiteful message, sure, and the man\u0027s an absolute coward, but he\u0027s surrendered, and the battle comes to an end. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t a major battle that ends the war, not a decisive victory or some great battle. No, it\u0027s a bunch of old friends growing tired of shedding each other\u0027s blood, or killing civilians, or executing prisoners. Instead, it\u0027s a few words, and a desperate plea for an end to the fighting. \n\n\nThe Republican prisoners are held for several months, but they\u0027re released with time. In November of 1924, a general amnesty is declared for acts committed during the civil war, and it all comes to an end.\n\n\nAfter the war, it seems there\u0027s finally a chance at peace. The Free State treats the anti-treaty rebels surprisingly well, and they\u0027re released after sometime. Many of these anti-Treaty leaders would rise up in politics as leaders of the nation, such as Eámon DeValera, President and Taoiseach, Sean Lemass, Taoiseach, and even the son of a man executed in the civil war, Erskine H. Childers, who would go on to be president. His father, Robert Erskine Childers, ran guns for the very first Volunteers, and was executed for holding arms in the civil war.\n\n\nAfter the war, you begin to rebuild the newfound nation. Two political parties rise up from Sinn Féin, known as Fianna Fail and Fianna Gael, the former made up of anti-Treaty politicians, the latter pro-Treaty politicians. These parties are joined by Sinn Féin, which becomes a more old-fashioned party focused mainly on the joining of Northern Ireland to the Republic, but of course, more parties rise up, such as Labour, the Green Party, Social Democrats and many more. \n\n\nHowever, it\u0027s not long before Fianna Fail is voted in, with Eamon DeValera taking power. The Statute of Westminster is signed, which gives Ireland substantial power in the United Kingdom. Through political maneuvering, the power of the British over the Free State is diminished, until the statute is used to overturn the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and Ireland succeeds from the UK, becoming the Republic of Ireland. It\u0027s a joyous day, but you can\u0027t help but feel bitter that the man who waged a war that got heroes like Michael Collins killed would end up later using the political methods to gain freedom like Collins had suggested. \n\n\nAs a free, independent nation, Ireland prospers. It advances quickly thanks to the prosperous economic policies of Taoiseach Sean Lemass, who had fought with the rebels in the Treaty War. The county slowly begins to end the sectarian conflict that plagued Ireland for generations, while outgrowing the zealous Catholic restrictions that plagued the nation.\n\n\nYour life story is far simpler, after the war. You get married to a girl you went to school with, having two children. She passes, unfortunately, although the relationship was never that... romantic, to say the least. Mary helps raise them with you, as you help her raise her boy, who never learns the unfortunate circumstances of his conception, only being told his father was killed by rebels in the war. Which, technically is true, both for Arthur and the blood father. Ma passes, as with all things, and time goes on. \n\n\nThe first child you name Joseph. It seems like a fitting name for the boy, who has the same stubbornness that Joseph held, as you come to find out. The second, a daughter, is named Saoirse, the Irish word for freedom. It seems fitting, after all you struggled for. \n\n\nIt\u0027s a summer day, as you walk through the seats at a football match, leading your children along to see Ireland play France. You can\u0027t wait to watch the match, even though the kids are far more into it than you. Well, Saoirse is. Joseph is just along for the ride, and it\u0027s good to get his head out of the books. Hell, it\u0027s that fact that makes him the farthest from Joseph he could be. You quickly find your seats, sitting down. You wrap your arms around your children, leaning back in your seat as you sigh in satisfaction.\n\n\n\"When\u0027s it starting, Dad?\" Saoirse asks.\n\n\n\"When it starts. Be patient,\" you smile back. \"Joseph, are you OK? You look cold.\"\n\n\n\"Fine, Dad,\" Joseph says back, distracted by a pretty girl several rows down.\n\n\nUgh, puberty. That\u0027s going to be something you\u0027re going to have to deal with. You smile, knowing you\u0027ve dealt with worse.\n\n\nBefore the ceremony begins, you all stand, as the Irish team begin to sing the national anthem and flags are waved. You join in, of course, as do your children and every Irishman in the stadium, at the top of your lungs.\n\n\nYou can\u0027t help but feel a swelling of pride. Tears well in your eye as you put your hand over your heart, and sing along with the national anthem. You\u0027re not proud of the flag, or the anthem. Well, you are, but that\u0027s not what brings tears to your eyes. You didn\u0027t fight for a colored flag or a catchy tune. You fought for the two children by your side, who will be raised as free citizens in a country that is theirs, not to be oppressed because of their race, religion or creed, but instead, to live free as Irish citizens. \n\n\nThat is why you\u0027re proud. That is what freedom truly means.\n",

We surrender!\"\n\n\n\"What?\" one of the IRA soldiers asks, taken aback.\n\n\n\"We can\u0027t fucking surrender!\" Joseph shouts angrily, his gun raised.\n\n\n\"Look, just...! Everybody, lower your rifles so n...!\" you try to formulate words, before the second push of IRA soldiers flood in, and it all goes to hell in a hand basket.\n\n\nThe next wave of IRA soldiers surges into the room behind you, and they\u0027re far more eager to break into fighting rather then trying to negotiate. Of course, this leads to the Free State soldiers raising their rifle as they fire back, and you\u0027re left stuck in the crossfire. Bullets hammer through you, back and front, as frantic, panicky riflemen fire into the confusing mess in front of them, unsure of what\u0027s going on. A bullet quickly finds its way to your skull, busting it open like a nut and sending your brains splattering out onto the floor.\n",
  "page 751": "You pause, unable to to pull the trigger. Instead, you take a deep breath.\n\n\nJoseph fires his pistol, two shots flying far over your head. Joseph\u0027s determined face contorts into a confused, emotional one, as he snarls at you.\n\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing, Michael! I don\u0027t want to kill you! I want to die a hero! They\u0027ll sing songs about me.\"\n\n\n\"This isn\u0027t a great song of heroes and glory, Joseph,\" you say, dropping your rifle. \"This is a song of sorrows, of dead fools and brothers killing brothers. I don\u0027t want to sing that song anymore.\"\n\n\n\"Pick up your rifle, Michael!\" Joseph says, gesturing with his pistol. \"You\u0027ve won! You don\u0027t have to die for your cause! I do!\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t care for causes anymore, Joseph. None of us need to die. For any of this. I\u0027ve buried too many friends on either side.\"\n\n\nJoseph walks forward, anger flashing on his face. He grabs you by the collar, jamming the barrel of his revolver against your head. \n\n\n\"Pick up that fucking rifle and finish this, Michael!\" he screams, tears running down his face.\n\n\nYou stare down at your rifle as it sits in the mud, before shaking your head. Joseph scowl drops, as he drops his revolver.\n\n\n\"You bastard,\" he says sadly. \"You won\u0027t even give me a fucking ending to this whole shit show.\"\n\n\nJoseph releases his grip on you, letting out a sigh. He raises his hands, putting them behind his head and dropping to his knees.\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Surrendering. What else can I do?\" Joseph softly. \n\n\nYou embrace Joseph, holding him tightly, as tears stream down your face. This isn\u0027t how it was supposed to go. You thought you were heroes, patriots, fighting for what was fight. You\u0027re not. No man is. You\u0027re just a bunch of poor peasants, pig farmers, fools who wanted to be something. You\u0027re not a famous King like Brian Boru or a famous patriot like Wolfe Tone.\n\n\nYou\u0027re just a pair of brothers who wanted to do more than mucking around in pigsties, who wanted something greater than that little farm in Dublin, who wanted a song to be sung about them. In the end, that\u0027s all that soldiers and rebels ever are.\n",
  "page 512": "You quickly turn, racing to exit the room as you grab Joseph, yanking him out with you. The Black and Tans quickly reach for their guns, raising them quickly and aiming as you hurry for the door. You run to shoulder the door open, but the gunfire goes off. Bullets slam into you, knocking you through the door as you stumble forward, before crumpling into the street, blood pooling around you. Joseph only manages to make it a few steps forward before the bullet to the chest causes him to collapse.\n\n\nThe two of you quickly bleed out in the street, as your assassination attempt comes to an end.\n",
  "page 633": "As time goes on, you slowly return to normal life, working hard on the farm and supporting the growing surge of nationalism that\u0027s erupting through the country.\n\n\nThe 1918 Irish general elections are a shocker, but make it clear how polarized the nation is thanks to the radicalizing effect of the Easter Rising and its aftermath. Of the 105 seats the Irish people had in the House of Commons, the last election had left the main Home Rule party, the Irish Parliamentary Party, with 74 seats, with 17 going to the Irish Unionist party which sought to keep Ireland as part of Britain. The nationalist Sinn Féin did not hold a single seat.\n\n\nAfter the elections, the Irish Parliamentary Party had six seats left. The Irish Unionist Party was left with 22. Sinn Féin now held a whopping 73 seats. Led by Éamon de Valera, a prominent commander in the Easter Rising who had been spared the firing squad due to his American citizenship and the fact that Britain was hoping to get America to join in on the war, Sinn Féin had become the most prominent party in Ireland. However, their members have taken a drastic policy, refusing to attend British parliament for fear that would legitimize Britain\u0027s rule over Ireland. What they plan to do next is anyone\u0027s guess.\n\n\nIt\u0027s the 21st of January, 1919. Thanks to winter, there\u0027s little work to do at the farm other than maintaining the animals, so you\u0027re left with a little free time. Given that it\u0027s nearly Mary\u0027s birthday, you\u0027ve went into the city to try purchase a gift for her with Joseph. \n\n\nYou walk along the cold streets, your hands in your coat. Joseph walks alongside you. A cigarette hangs in your lips, while you listen to Joseph trying to justify his gift idea.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good for her, but it\u0027s good for the whole house! That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re being selfish, we\u0027re just being logical.\"\n\n\n\"Mary doesn\u0027t drink, Joseph. She\u0027s had a few sips, but she\u0027ll never appreciate anything worth giving as a gift.\"\n\n\n\"Well, what do you suppose?\" he asks.\n\n\nYou pass a group of young girls walking together. You tip your hat and smile at them, as they all smile respectfully back. You turn back to Joseph to continue your conversation, but your brother has a big, goofy grin on his face. \n\n\n\"She was looking at you, Michael. She seemed like she was dripping,\" he laughs.\n\n\n\"Dripping?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Yeah. You know what I mean.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, shrugging.\n\n\n\"Christ, you really haven\u0027t been with many girls. Or more accurately, any girls. She liked you, Michael. Speaking of, I\u0027ve heard there\u0027s more than a few girls are on the hunt for a man like you, you know. Katie Hales, for instance.\"\n\n\n\"The one with the face like a horse? I\u0027ll pass, Joseph.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, don\u0027t be a bollocks. Jane Garrety. She\u0027s a pretty girl, you can\u0027t argue with me there.\"\n\n\n\"Barely a personality there at all. I\u0027d sooner marry horse-face.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re an awful man. There must be some woman you like.\"\n\n\nYou shake your head, as Joseph groans in frustration.\n\n\n\"You know, maybe those rumors are true, for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027ve heard the rumors before, and this. The accuracy in them might be what makes them so enraging.\n\n\n\"Watch your fucking tone with me,\" you growl.\" I swear to fuck, I will put your head through a fucking wall.\" \n\n\n\"Shit, sorry, sorry!\" Joseph says, raising his hands defensively. \"Didn\u0027t mean to start anything.\"\n\n\n\"Then don\u0027t,\" you say tersely.\n\n\nYou walk on for about a minute as Joseph goes silent and cowers down. Finally, he decides to break the silence again.\n\n\n\"So, shall we get the whiskey?\" Joseph asks innocently. \n\n\n\"Christ above,\" you mutter. \n\n\n\"Well, I don\u0027t hear any suggestions from you.\"\n\n\n\"Something girly. A dress, or something.\"\n\n\n\"Do you know Mary\u0027s size?\" Joseph asks, as you stare at him blankly.\n\n\n\"Ah for fuck\u0027s sake, I don\u0027t know. She\u0027s fairly small.\"\n\n\n\"I doubt \"fairly small\" is a dress size.\"\n\n\n\"Christ above, then get her a book, or a fucking c...!\"\n\n\nYou slam into another man, knocking his papers to the ground as he nearly tips backwards. You grab his wrist, keeping steady, before dropping low to gather his papers.\n\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" you apologize. \"I was distracted by my brother.\"\n\n\nYou pause, recognizing him.\n\n\n\"Rory? Rory O\u0027Connor?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Ah, it\u0027s the McCarthy brothers!\" he grins. \"It\u0027s great to see you both. How\u0027s life after Frongoch?\"\n\n\n\"Too close to life before Frongoch,\" you say. \n\n\n\"How are you, Rory?\" Joseph grins, as the man smiles.\n\n\n\"So, how\u0027s life with you?\" he asks, grinning.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re both surviving. What are you rushing about to do, anyway? You were in some fierce hurry.\"\n\n\n\"I do indeed, I\u0027ve a lot to do, actually,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says. \"Speaking of, you could help me in that. I\u0027m on a recruitment drive.\"\n\n\n\"For what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The Irish Republican Army. We\u0027re reorganizing the Irish Volunteers, turning them into a proper fighting force. I\u0027m taking on the role of Director of Engineering.\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s no republic for there to be an army to fight for,\" you point out.\n\n\n\"That changes today. The Sinn Féin politicians are getting together to found the first Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, the assembly of Ireland. We will declare an Irish republic, and with that, the IRA will have a nation to fight for. While you\u0027re here, actually, we\u0027re in a bit of a recruitment drive. So, I suppose I\u0027ll just ask. McCarthy Brothers, will you join the IRA and fight for this newfound nation?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m in,\" Joseph says, extending his hand as the two shake hands. \"I\u0027ll happily shed my blood for this country once more.\"\n\n\n\"Delightful,\" he says, grinning, before turning to you. \"Michael? Your experience in the IRB and Rising could be appreciated. A lot of people have a lot of respect for you. We could use someone like you.\"\n",
  "page 754": "With the final sweep of the IRA-controlled territory, the Free State regains control of the country. The IRA fighters move into a guerrilla phase, performing ambushes, assassinating key Free State leaders and bombing infrastructure. Still, the fact that the anti-Treaty forces have far less support than the original IRA in their fight against the British, means that the anti-Treaty forces can\u0027t survive with this guerrilla warfare like you once did.  Frank Aiken is nearly captured, with the Quinn brothers, his lieutenants being killed or captured. Frank Aiken manages to escape, although little more than a week later he calls a cease fire in an attempt to minimize the death and destruction from his new position of leadership in the IRA.\n\n\nThe month after has little fighting, mostly just waiting, as you patiently wonder what\u0027s to happen. Due to the fractured nature of the IRA, many continue fighting despite the ceasefire, although the violence is hugely decreased, and you personally don\u0027t see any action against these remaining groups. Then, Frank Aiken gives the order. \"Dump arms, and return home\". It\u0027s that simple. Toss your rifle aside and go home, and the war is over. With that, your enemy is defeated. Eamon DeValera supports this move, sending out the following message: \"Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic\". It\u0027s a spiteful message, sure, and the man\u0027s an absolute coward, but he\u0027s surrendered, and the battle comes to an end. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t a major battle that ends the war, not a decisive victory or some great battle. No, it\u0027s a bunch of old friends growing tired of shedding each other\u0027s blood, or killing civilians, or executing prisoners. Instead, it\u0027s a few words, and a desperate plea for an end to the fighting. \n\n\nThe Republican prisoners, Joseph included, are held for several months, but they\u0027re released with time. In November of 1924, a general amnesty is declared for acts committed during the civil war, and it all comes to an end.\n\n\nAfter the war, it seems there\u0027s finally a chance at peace. The Free State treats the anti-treaty rebels surprisingly well, and they\u0027re released after sometime. Many of these anti-Treaty leaders would rise up in politics as leaders of the nation, such as Eámon DeValera, President and Taoiseach, Sean Lemass, Taoiseach, and even the son of a man executed in the civil war, Erskine H. Childers, who would go on to be president. His father, Robert Erskine Childers, ran guns for the very first Volunteers, and was executed for holding arms in the civil war. \n\n\nAfter the war, you begin to rebuild the newfound nation. Two political parties rise up from Sinn Féin, known as Fianna Fail and Fianna Gael, the former made up of anti-Treaty politicians, the latter pro-Treaty politicians. These parties are joined by Sinn Féin, which becomes a more old-fashioned party focused mainly on the joining of Northern Ireland to the Republic, but of course, more parties rise up, such as Labour, the Green Party, Social Democrats and many more. \n\n\nHowever, it\u0027s not long before Fianna Fail is voted in, with Eamon DeValera taking power. The Statute of Westminster is signed, which gives Ireland substantial power in the United Kingdom. Through political maneuvering, the power of the British over the Free State is diminished, until the statute is used to overturn the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and Ireland succeeds from the UK, becoming the Republic of Ireland.

Which, technically is true, both for Arthur and the blood father. Ma passes, as with all things, and time goes on. Joseph helps out as well, of course, but he\u0027s busy settling down with his own family, a pair of kids of his own, twins named Rory, after the late Rory O\u0027Connor, and Arthur, which Mary appreciates.

  "page 755": "With the final sweep of the IRA-controlled territory, the Free State regains control of the country. The IRA fighters move into a guerrilla phase, performing ambushes, assassinating key Free State leaders and bombing infrastructure. Still, the fact that the anti-Treaty forces have far less support than the original IRA in their fight against the British, means that the anti-Treaty forces can\u0027t survive with this guerrilla warfare like you once did.  Frank Aiken is nearly captured, with the Quinn brothers, his lieutenants being killed or captured. Frank Aiken manages to escape, although little more than a week later he calls a cease fire in an attempt to minimize the death and destruction from his new position of leadership in the IRA.\n\n\nThe month after has little fighting, mostly just waiting, as you patiently wonder what\u0027s to happen. Due to the fractured nature of the IRA, many continue fighting despite the ceasefire, although the violence is hugely decreased, and you personally don\u0027t see any action against these remaining groups. Then, Frank Aiken gives the order. \"Dump arms, and return home\". It\u0027s that simple. Toss your rifle aside and go home, and the war is over. With that, your enemy is defeated. Eamon DeValera supports this move, sending out the following message: \"Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic\". It\u0027s a spiteful message, sure, and the man\u0027s an absolute coward, but he\u0027s surrendered, and the battle comes to an end. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t a major battle that ends the war, not a decisive victory or some great battle. No, it\u0027s a bunch of old friends growing tired of shedding each other\u0027s blood, or killing civilians, or executing prisoners. Instead, it\u0027s a few words, and a desperate plea for an end to the fighting. \n\n\nThe Republican prisoners, Joseph included, are held for several months, but they\u0027re released with time. In November of 1924, a general amnesty is declared for acts committed during the civil war, and it all comes to an end.\n\n\nAfter the war, it seems there\u0027s finally a chance at peace. The Free State treats the anti-treaty rebels surprisingly well, and they\u0027re released after sometime. Many of these anti-Treaty leaders would rise up in politics as leaders of the nation, such as Eámon DeValera, President and Taoiseach, Sean Lemass, Taoiseach, and even the son of a man executed in the civil war, Erskine H. Childers, who would go on to be president. His father, Robert Erskine Childers, ran guns for the very first Volunteers, and was executed for holding arms in the civil war.\n\n\nAfter the war, you begin to rebuild the newfound nation. Two political parties rise up from Sinn Féin, known as Fianna Fail and Fianna Gael, the former made up of anti-Treaty politicians, the latter pro-Treaty politicians. These parties are joined by Sinn Féin, which becomes a more old-fashioned party focused mainly on the joining of Northern Ireland to the Republic, but of course, more parties rise up, such as Labour, the Green Party, Social Democrats and many more. \n\n\nHowever, it\u0027s not long before Fianna Fail is voted in, with Eamon DeValera taking power. The Statute of Westminster is signed, which gives Ireland substantial power in the United Kingdom. Through political maneuvering, the power of the British over the Free State is diminished, until the statute is used to overturn the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and Ireland succeeds from the UK, becoming the Republic of Ireland. It\u0027s a joyous day, but you can\u0027t help but feel bitter that the man who waged a war that got heroes like Michael Collins killed would end up later using the political methods to gain freedom like Collins had suggested. \n\n\nAs a free, independent nation, Ireland prospers. It advances quickly thanks to the prosperous economic policies of Taoiseach Sean Lemass, who had fought with the rebels in the Treaty War. The county slowly begins to end the sectarian conflict that plagued Ireland for generations, while outgrowing the zealous Catholic restrictions that plagued the nation.\n\n\nYour life story is far simpler, after the war. You get married to a girl you went to school with, having a child. Your wife, Fiona, passes, unfortunately, although the relationship was never that... romantic, to say the least. Mary and Arthur help raise them with you, as you become a favored uncle to their child, who never learns the unfortunate circumstances of his conception. Which, technically is true, both for Arthur and the blood father. Ma passes, as with all things, and time goes on. Joseph helps out as well, of course, but he\u0027s busy settling down with his own family, a pair of kids of his own, twins named Rory, after the late Rory O\u0027Connor, and Jack, after his wife\u0027s father. You name your daughter Saoirse, the Irish word for freedom. It seems fitting, after all you struggled for. You settle down to a simple job as a plumber, which may not be the most glorious job, but soon gives you your own business after a fair bit of work.\n\n\nIt\u0027s a summer day, as you walk through the seats at a football match, leading your lit tle girlalong to see Ireland play France. You can\u0027t wait to watch the match, even though Saoirse\u0027s far more into it than you. You quickly find your seats, sitting down. You wrap your arms around your daughter, leaning back in your seat as you sigh in satisfaction.\n\n\n\"When\u0027s it starting, Dad?\" Saoirse asks.\n\n\n\"When it starts. Be patient,\" you smile back. \"You\u0027re too giddy.\"\n\n\n\"I want to see the much.\"\n\n\n\"And you will, it\u0027ll be happening right in front of you. Eventually,\" you chuckle.\n\n\nBefore the ceremony begins, you all stand, as the Irish team begin to sing the national anthem and flags are waved. You join in, of course, as does Saoirse and every Irishman in the stadium, at the top of your lungs.\n\n\nYou can\u0027t help but feel a swelling of pride. Tears well in your eye as you put your hand over your heart, and sing along with the national anthem. You\u0027re not proud of the flag, or the anthem. Well, you are, but that\u0027s not what brings tears to your eyes. You didn\u0027t fight for a colored flag or a catchy tune. You fought for the little girl by your side, who will be raised as a free citizen in a country that is hers, not to be oppressed because of her race, religion or creed, but instead, to live free as an Irish citizen. \n\n\nThat is why you\u0027re proud. That is what freedom truly means.\n",

You\u0027re treated relatively fairly, with three meals a day and good conditions, although the most painful fact is that you\u0027re unable to take part in the fight for true independence.\n\n\nYou spend several months imprisoned, being moved between various holding cells rather than being sent to an actual prison. It\u0027s more boring than anything else, as you spend your days stuck in small cells, making small talk with the guards who know they shouldn\u0027t befriend you, even though you share interests, grew up close enough and fought the same enemy for most of your career as soldiers. Hell, you probably saved a few of your guards lives in the fight against the British, or they saved you. You spend most of your days in your cell, reading from the old Irish writers like W.B. Yeats, James Joyce with his new masterpiece Ulysses that\u0027s barely a year old, and your personal favorite, Oscar Wilde.\n\n\nHowever, you eventually manage to find an ally amongst the prison staff, a man you served with in the IRA against the British who isn\u0027t entirely set on the Treaty. As an old favor, he offers you a chance to decide where you\u0027re being transferred... off the books, of course. You\u0027re left with two choices. The larger Dundalk Prison, or a smaller prison in Dublin.\n\n\nDundalk is the main place where Republican prisoners are being held, and being transferred there could give you a possible chance to stage a break out with the others. As well as this, it could give you some ability to network with other Republicans from across the country.\n\n\nHowever, the Dublin prison is far closer to home. You won\u0027t be able to fight, but you might still see your family, barring Joseph, although there\u0027s rumors of brutality against IRA prisoners of war in Dublin and it\u0027s surrounding areas.\n",

I support your fight, but I\u0027ve had enough bloodshed in my life.\"\n\n\n\"So be it,\" Rory O\u0027Connor says, disappointed. \"I suppose it\u0027s a lot to ask you to serve the country through violence.

I thought you\u0027d support the fight, especially after fighting in the Rising.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m tired of all the fighting. Hopefully, we\u0027ll just be coming into a time of peace.

  "page 518": "You charge forward, bashing into him as you knock him against the wall, before you toss him onto the table. You raise your gun, before you begin to pistol-whip the man as you smash the heavy iron gun into his face as you smash his head against the table, bashing teeth and blood across the table. You repeatedly smash the gun against him until his face is nearly caved in, before you pause, looking over to Joseph. The last Black and Tan still standing pins Joseph to the ground, keeping his arms pressed against the ground with his knees as he begins to punch him.\n\n\nYou quickly fumble for the bullets left in your coat pocket, grabbing one as you flick out the chamber, shaking out the shells inside. You quickly pop the bullet into the chamber, clicking it into place. You raise your revolver, firing and striking the man in the side of the head, blowing out his brains and knocking him to the ground. You pause, sighing as you walk over to Joseph, reaching down. Joseph grasps your hand as you yank him to his feet, looking at you with a heavily bruised face.\n\n\n\"God above, my face stings like a bitch,\" Joseph says. \n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" you say, as Joseph stumbles to the bar, leaning heavily against it as he grabs a half-finished pint of Guinness, bought by a long-gone patron who disappeared when things got rough.\n\n\nJoseph drinks it down with a few chugs, before clambering over the bar as he grabs a bottle of whiskey. He climbs over the bar again, heading to the door with you. \n\n\n\"Pass the drink,\" you say, as he uncaps the whiskey before passing it over to you. \"If nothing else, this\u0027ll be a story for your IRA friends.\"\n\n\n\"Here here,\" Joseph says, as you take a long drink of the burning liquid. \"At least we avenged Mary.\"\n\n\n\"Mary doesn\u0027t give a fuck about justice or being avenged,\" you say. \"Let\u0027s be honest, this was for us.\"\n\n\n\"I suppose,\" Joseph we says. \"What\u0027ll we tell Arthur?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll see what she wants to do,\" you say. \"We\u0027ll tell him for her, if she needs.\"\n\n\nIn the late, dark back roads, you find it easy to escape off into the night. It\u0027s a long, cold work home, as you drink to warm yourself and deal with the stress of the night. By the time you get there, the bottle\u0027s empty, and it\u0027s early in the morning. You walk into the house, exhausted, drunk and tired. Ma sits in the kitchen, praying over her bible again. You walk in, sitting down next to her. \n\n\n\"Where is she?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"She\u0027s in bed.\"\n\n\n\"Is she alright?\" Joseph asks.\n\n\n\"No,\" Ma says.\n\n\n\"Of course not,\" you say. \"The poor girl.

I\u0027ll make sure to have a few of the unit looking after you, though.\"\n\n\n\"Where will we go?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We head down South. I have allies down there in the IRA, they\u0027ll set us up in a safe house for a while. We\u0027ll have to do our part to help out, but it\u0027ll be fine.\"\n\n\n\"So, I\u0027ll be bunking in with your IRA friends? Delightful,\" you say.\n\n\n\"They\u0027ll take us in happily.

You\u0027re two strong, good sons.\"\n\n\n\"We love you too, Ma,\" you say.\n\n\nWith that, you pack your things, gathering up everything you\u0027ll need.

Probably a good idea. Still, it\u0027s not too miserable, and you\u0027re probably treated well. It\u0027s a boring, miserable existence, but tolerable.\n\n\nIt\u0027s another one of those dark, miserable days, like most days in prison, where you\u0027ve been left to rot in your cell, lying about it as you wait for something to happen. Daydreaming, you imagine being back at the farm, a few friends at your side as you work in the nice, sunny weather, free at last...\n\n\nYour daydreaming is interrupted as a guard rushes up to the cell doors, looking panicked and frantic.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re being evacuated!

One of them pauses, pressing his grinning, bearded face between the cell bars.\n\n\n\"Michael!\" Joseph grins.\n\n\n\"Joseph?\" you ask. \"Jesus, Joseph, what the fuck are you doing here?\"\n\n\n\"We were coming to see you, but visiting hours weren\u0027t on so we had to break in and get you out of here,\" Joseph smiles. \n\n\nJoseph moves down, grabbing the keys off the guard and quickly unlocking the cell door.

Over 400 rifles are taken, with 240 Republican prisoners being released. Quickly, you move patrols out, taking the town and routing the Free State soldiers from it. Most are captured or escape off into the hills, with only a few kills. Perhaps it\u0027s because your rescuers are far more hesitant to shoot fellow Irishmen than they are British occupiers.\n\n\nQuickly, however, the next wave of Free State soldiers soon arrive and prepare a counter-attack to take back the town. Quickly, Frank Aiken assembles a few high-ranking IRA soldiers whose opinions he trusts, and thankfully you\u0027re one of them thanks to the fact you actually were kept in this prison and are the brother of Aiken\u0027s newest lieutenant. \n\n\n\"We have a problem,\" Frank Aiken says. \"The Br...\"\n\n\nFrank Aiken pauses, almost forgetting himself. For many of you, Aiken included, it\u0027s been a hard transition to go from fighting British soldiers to former friends and comrades.\n\n\n\"The Free State have arrived in force. They\u0027re going to attempt to push us out of the city, and we need to decide how we\u0027re going to react before they organize and attack. I need opinions.

It seems like the most peaceful way this can end.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s too weak. We need to hit them hard, before they have a chance to properly organize. We can strike a hard blow, and push them back with ease,\" one of the soldiers says.\n\n\n\"No, we should hold down. We have the arms, we have the men, and we\u0027ll have the defensive advantage,\" a particularly qualified soldier named Sean F. Quinn says.\n\n\n\"And what do the McCarthy twins think?

Still, he\u0027s always kind, even if he\u0027s a bit eager to show off his scar. \n\n\n\"How\u0027s life, Rory?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good enough. Are you looking for Joseph?\"\n\n\n\"I am. Have you seen him?\"\n\n\n\"He should be back in a few minutes, if you want to wait. I think he was heading off to find cigarettes.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" you say, sitting down on one of the beds.\n\n\nYou sit down and begin making small talk with Rory. The man spent quite a fair bit of time in Canada as a railway engineer, so he regales you with a story about a deer carcass on the track. He\u0027s just finishing with the unfortunate yet hilarious ending when Joseph shows up again.\n\n\n\"Rory, I couldn\u0027t find... oh, Michael. How are you doing?\"\n\n\n\"Just checking in. How\u0027s life going?\"\n\n\n\"Well, my roommates an asshole, but besides that, things are going pretty well.\"\n\n\nThe three of you discuss past, present and future over the next few minutes, before suddenly, you\u0027re interrupted by the cheering and celebrating of your fellow Irishmen outside.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong?\" you ask, leaning out of the room at a passing Irishman. \"What are ye so giddy about?\" \n\n\n\"We\u0027re being released!\" one of them says. \"The British are releasing us in order to focus on the Great War and to try pacify us! Fat fucking chance!\"\n\n\nYou pause, grinning, as the Irishman hugs you.\n\n\n\"Seriously? This is unbelievable! We\u0027re going back to Ireland!\"\n\n\nYou grin as Joseph hugs you, feeling a great joy surge through you. Just like that, the British are releasing the men who gent rebelled against them, and you\u0027re free again.\n\n\nAnd just like that, after only eight months, you\u0027re released from Frongoch, and returning home to Ireland.\n",

The armored car quickly bursts into action, letting out a burst of machine gun fire that bursts towards you. Bullets begin pinging off the ground around you, as you toss the grenade through the air. It bounces along the road, rolling to a stop right next to the Mutineer. You dive down low as it goes off, showering the Mutineer with shrapnel.\n\n\nYou quickly rise up, charging ahead again, before the gunner twists to aim at you. The machine crackles with a burst of gunfire, as bullets slam into your body, knocking you off your feet and shredding your organs, killing you instantly.

More gunfire tears through the air, slamming into you as you collapse onto the bonnet of the car. You slowly slide off the car, leaving a bloody smear on the car.\n",

  "page 304": "A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan Mountains, but on the valley side the water is lined with trees — willows fresh and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winter’s flooding; and sycamores with mottled, white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool. On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them. Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of ‘coons, and with the spreadpads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split-wedge tracks of deer that come to drink in the dark.\n\n\nThere is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a path beaten hard by boys coming down, and trust me, I do mean a path beaten hard by boys. Anal metaphors a plenty in this story, don\u0027t you worry sir. Anyhow, a path from the ranches to swim in the deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungle-up near water. In front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it. All over it, leaving it stinking off ass. The perfect limb, really.\n\n\nEvening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the leaves. The shade climbed up the hills toward the top. On the sand banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones. And then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried noiselessly for cover. A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down river. For a moment the place was lifeless, and then two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green pool.\n\n\nThey had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open one stayed behind the other. Both were dressed in denim trousers that had regularly been pulled aside to allow for anal and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first man was small and quick to cum, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, and wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.\n\n\nThe first man stopped short in the clearing, and the follower nearly ran over him. He took off his hat and wiped the sweat-band with his forefinger and snapped the moisture off. He licked his sweat off his finger, loving it, his erection growing instantaneously. His huge companion dropped his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of the green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into the water like a horse. The small man stepped nervously beside him.\n\n\n“Lennie!” he said sharply. “Lennie, for God’ sakes don’t drink so much.” Lennie continued to snort into the pool. The small man leaned over and shook him by the shoulder. “Lennie. You gonna be sick like you was last night. It\u0027s only a matter of time before you get AIDS, and then I get AIDS, and trust me, I don\u0027t want that.\"\n\n\nLennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back. “That’s good,” he said. “You drink some, George. You take a good big drink.” He smiled happily. \"I know you love drinking, but it ain\u0027t usually water.\"\n\n\nGeorge unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank. “I ain’t sure it’s good water,” he said. “Looks kinda scummy.”\n\n\nLennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. “Look, George. Look what I done.”\n\n\nGeorge knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick scoops. “Tastes all right,” he admitted. “It\u0027s no cum, but it\u0027ll do. Don’t really seem to be running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain’t running, Lennie,” he said hopelessly. “You’d drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty.” He threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.\n\n\nGeorge stared morosely at the water. The rims of his eyes were red with sun glare. He said angrily, “We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin’ about. ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the highway,’ he says. ‘Jes’ a little stretch.’ God damn near four miles, that’s what it was! Didn’t wanta stop at the ranch gate, that’s what. Too God damn lazy to pull up. Or to pull out, matter of fact. Bastard came right inside me. Wonder he isn’t too damn good to stop in Soledad at all. Kicks us out and says ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the road.’ I bet it was more than four miles. Damn hot day.”\n\n\nLennie looked timidly over to him. “George?”\n\n\n“Yeah, what ya want?”\n\n\n“Where we goin’, George?”\n\n\nThe little man jerked off slightly with his muscular hands, choking his cock like a puppy, or a woman, or... shit, forget that bit, it\u0027s not happened yet. Jerking off, he was jerking off. Oh hang on, that\u0027s the other one, don\u0027t worry, keep reading. I mean...\n\n\nHe pushed down the brim of his hat and scowled over at Lennie. “So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!”\n\n\n“I forgot,” Lennie said softly. “I tried not to forget. Honest to God I did, George.”\n\n\n“O.K — O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got nothing to do. Might jus’ as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you things and then you forget ‘em, and I tell you again.”\n\n\n“Tried and tried,” said Lennie, “but it didn’t do no good. I remember about the rabbits, George.”\n\n\n“The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever can remember is them rabbits. O.K.! Now you listen and this time you got to remember so we don’t get in no trouble. You remember settin’ in that gutter on Howard Street and watchin’ that blackboard?”\n\n\nLennie’s face broke into a delighted smile. “Why sure, George. I remember that.... but.... what’d we do then? I remember some girls come by and you says.... you says....”\n\n\n“The hell with what I says. You remember about us goin’ in to Murray and Ready’s, and they give us work cards and bus tickets?”\n\n\n“Oh, sure, George. I remember that now.” His hands went quickly into his side coat pockets. He said gently, “George.... I ain’t got mine. I musta lost it.” He looked down at the ground in despair.\n",

The sun\u0027s out, there\u0027s clear skies above. There\u0027s a cool breeze, birds flying overhead, and the a general beauty in the world that feels delightful.\n\n\nGod, it feels good to be back in Ireland. What a homecoming.\n\n\n\"This is what we fought for, isn\u0027t it?\" Joseph asks. \"This beautiful nation.\"\n\n\nYou arrive at the old wooden door to the place, pulling it open as you stroll inside. \n\n\n\"Hello?\" you ask loudly. \n\n\nMary appears out of the kitchen, looking at you. She certainly looks older now, her hair longer, her face more matured and like a woman rather than a girl, her body less boyish than you\u0027d have hoped as she\u0027s matured into a full, grown woman. Mary blinks slowly, staring at you in shock.\n\n\n\"Michael? Joseph?\" she asks. \"Boys! Ma, the boys are home!\"\n\n\nMary rushes towards you, embracing you, You wrap an arm around her, lifting her into the air as she laughs. Joseph quickly bursts in, hugging the two of you as Mary begins to tear up.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s so good to see you. I\u0027ve missed you both so much.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m glad to see you too, Mary,\" you grin. \"How are things?\"\n\n\nMa appears in the hallway, rushing towards you as fast as the hobbled over woman can. With almost surprising strength she squeezes you tightly, planting a kiss on your lips before another goes on your cheek.\n\n\n\"My two boys, both come home to me after being taken!\" Ma shrieks loudly, pulling you in for a tight hug. \"Oh boys, the Lord has blessed me. He\u0027s so good to me, so good to me.\"\n\n\n\"Come on, let\u0027s go get a cup of tea and hear all about how you\u0027ve been,\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you say. \"I\u0027m dying for a taste of the Irish stuff.\"\n",

Many of them are forced to use old-model rifles and pistols, while your forces have top of the line weapons thanks to support from the British Empire. \n\n\nThe IRA soldiers quickly realize their position is failing, and they begin to fall back, desperately trying to escape out of of the Eastern Section.

Although it was a decisive win for the National Army, that was always going to be the case, as the IRA troops in the Four Courts were outnumbered twenty times over, with only 200 IRA soldiers facing 4000 Free State Troops. Although the Irish capital city of Dublin was secured by the new government, leaders like Cathal Brugha killed and men like Rory O\u0027Connor, your old friend at the original IRA, and even though the anti-Treaty soldiers were dispersed and their strength broken, many anti-Treaty leaders such as Oscar Traynor, your old friend Ernie O\u0027Malley and many other anti-Treaty fighters managed to escape to continue the fight. With this, the spirit of war managed to survive, and inspired many other anti-Free State units to stand up and oppose the new National Army. \n\n\nYou know this is the start of what\u0027s to be a brutal conflict.

Once the place is suitably flammable, you light simply light a match, and toss it into the puddle.\n\n\nImmediately and with a roar of heat, the flames quickly begin to run along the gas as flames begin to feast upon the house\u0027s old wooden structure. It\u0027s not long before this quick burn spreads throughout the place, letting large, powerful flames engulf the old wooden consume the massive building. It\u0027s not long before it\u0027s completely up in flames, falling in on itself as the great big bonfire spews smoke up at the sky. \n\n\n\"Beautiful sight, isn\u0027t it?\" Joseph says. \"That\u0027s revolution, that.\"\n\n\n\"If you say so. Let\u0027s get out of here, Joseph,\" you say.\n\n\nWith that, you quickly move away from the great big fire, getting back in the truck and racing off into the distance.\n",

Another man goes to help him, before a round hits him in the chest. You swear, realizing you\u0027re taking heavier losses than the mission planned for. You move forward, opening fire at you blow a hole in the stomach of a soldier, who collapses to the ground. After a few minutes, the gunfight is coming to an end, with the British soldiers nearly eliminated. You continue opening fire, killing the last few of the enemies as they drop to the ground.\n\n\nYour forces quickly move forward, taking the trucks. You check your casualties, and they aren\u0027t ideal. You\u0027ve lost four men, with two wounded. Even though you managed to secure the arms, you took quite a few casualties. At this rate, you\u0027re losing far more men than you\u0027re recruiting to keep this war against the British going.

  "page 653": "The next few months are a dark, miserable time. Ever since the Sean McGarry incident, you and Joseph are both noticeably darker. You contribute less to the cause, spending large amounts of time at home in the fields. There, in the fields, you can work for hours on end, focusing on nothing but work. You don\u0027t have to picture children burning alive in fires just out of your view. No, you don\u0027t have to deal with that until night falls.\n\n\nBy April 1923, the fight for independence has worsened considerably for your side. More and more IRA soldiers are captured, with over 12,000 imprisoned at this point in the war. Ernie O\u0027Malley, the man who trained the old IRA unit in the fight against the British, is shot twenty times, before being captured. Impressively, he manages to survive. The IRA forces are desperate for peace, hoping they\u0027ll simply survive as it becomes clear there\u0027s little chance of success. Frank Aiken, who you know quite well at this point, is elected to the Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, becoming the anti-Treaty commander. He\u0027s nearly captured, with the Quinn brothers, his lieutenants who you talked to briefly, being killed or captured. Frank Aiken manages to escape, although little more than a week later he calls a cease fire in an attempt to minimize the death and destruction from his new position.\n\n\nThe month after has little fighting, mostly just waiting, as you patiently wonder what\u0027s to happen. Due to the fractured nature of the IRA, many continue fighting despite the ceasefire, although the violence is hugely decreased. Then, Frank Aiken gives the order. \"Dump arms, and return home\". It\u0027s that simple. Toss your rifle aside and go home, and the war is over. Eamon DeValera supports this move, sending out the following message: \"Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic\". It\u0027s a spiteful message, sure, but an order of surrender. \n\n\nIt isn\u0027t a major battle that ends the war, not a decisive victory or some great battle. No, it\u0027s a bunch of old friends growing tired of shedding each other\u0027s blood, or killing civilians, or executing prisoners. Instead, it\u0027s a few words, and a desperate plea for an end to the fighting. \n\n\nThe night of the 24th of May, you\u0027re staying in an IRA safe-house with the rest of your unit as you wait for word, preparing to attack if the Free State break the cease fire. \n\n\nWhen you get the order, there\u0027s a mixed response. Some cheer. Some swear. Joseph, however, doesn\u0027t say a word. He nods grimly, and heads to his bed. There\u0027s a few words of complaint, but most of the men are tired of the killing. There\u0027s rumors that a few of them are going to mutiny, to refuse the orders and continue the fight. You... you don\u0027t know anymore. You\u0027ve given up so much for this war. Done so much. You wonder, can you abandon the cause after all this?\n",

Fall back and regroup!\" Fionn yells after giving you a nod, as you quickly firing at the soldiers, heading into the grass.  \n\n\nYou quickly disappear off into the grass, rushing off through the fields. The British soldiers don\u0027t have the numbers to follow and confront you, especially since they fear you might just be leading them into another ambush. After a few minutes, you disappear off back to the nearby town, where your cousin Patrick has a house he\u0027s allowed you to use. From there, you\u0027re easily able to split off, escaping before any British counter-attacks can occur. \n\n\nYou\u0027ve escaped the brutal ambush with not a single soldier lost, although you failed to secure the weapons. Now, without your weapons, continuing fighting is going to be far harder than ever before. As ammunition and arms run low, you don\u0027t know how long you\u0027ll be able to last.\n",

Now that Sean McGarry\u0027s house has been burned down, you\u0027ve made it known you can get to him. Now, you\u0027re to make your threat a bit more clear, to try force him to shift his support in favor of opposing the treaty to help give more of a political edge to the right side of this whole conflict.\n\n\nThe two of you wear long, dark coats and low brimmers as you approach him on the street outside his Mother\u0027s house in the city. You both have pistols hidden in your coat, although you doubt you\u0027ll use it. You approach the man, noting just how haggard and red-faced he looks. He looks broken, and like he hasn\u0027t slept a wink.\n\n\n\"Good evening,\" you nod. \"Mr Sean McGarry, I presume?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Aye,\" the man nods back after a second, before falling silent again, his gaze distant.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t say a word, don\u0027t call for help, don\u0027t run,\" you say. \"We\u0027re from the IRA, and we have two guns aiming straight at your heart.\"\n\n\nSean McGarry doesn\u0027t say a word back, perhaps trying not to show fear. You wait a moment for him to respond, before continuing. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re very powerful people, McGarry. As I think you understand, we have access to your home life, to you, to your family. And we\u0027re not afraid to take things to a darker place than things need to go if you don\u0027t do as we ask.\"\n\n\n\"You... you what?\" he asks, seeming to snap to reality, the haze of confusion lifting.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re the men who burned your house to the fucking ground. Now, we\u0027re more than...!\"\n\n\nSuddenly, Sean McGarry grabs Joseph, slamming him against the wall with remarkable speed. His fingers immediately begin scratching at his eyes as Joseph yelps, taken entirely by surprise.\n\n\n\"Jesus Christ!\" you say, frantically drawing your gun and jamming it against the man\u0027s head. \"Get the fuck off him!\" \n\n\nSurprisingly, he doesn\u0027t react to the gun, instead swinging at you and knocking you to the ground as you let out a pained grunt. \n\n\n\"You fucking animals! ANIMALS!\" Sean McGarry screams, diving on top of you as he begins to elbow you in the nose, no doubt breaking something as your face is repeatedly smashed. Joseph grabs him, hefting him off you as he immediately turns his rage back to Joseph.\n\n\n\"Fucking hell, we\u0027ll kill you if you don\u0027t stop! Calm down!\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m going to claw out your fucking heart, you monster!\" Sean McGarry spits, lunging at Joseph again as the two grapple, nearly toppling into the street. \"He was a boy! A fucking boy! He had no part in this, you animals!\"\n\n\nSean McGarry grabs for Joesph\u0027s gun, lifting it into the air. He pulls the trigger, as the gun goes off, loudly attracting the attention of anyone who hasn\u0027t already been drawn to the fight. No doubt it won\u0027t be long before the RIC show up. \n\n\n\"What boy? We didn\u0027t touch anyone, we just fucked with a house!\" you say, as the two of you pin Sean McGarry against the wall, tearing the gun from his hands. \n\n\n\"My boy!\" Sean McGarry says, his anger breaking into deep sadness as tears run down his face. \"You killed my boy Emmet! He was only seven, you fucking animals! He had no part in this war!\"\n\n\n\"We didn\u0027t do anything!\" Joseph says, keeping him pinned against the wall with his weight.\n\n\n\"His fucking boy! His fucking body was found in the ash, you fucking animals!\" Sean McGarry says. \n\n\nYou pause, going pale as you realize what\u0027s happened. You didn\u0027t have time to search the whole house. You were just relying on what you were told, that the house was empty. There... Jesus, there was a boy in there.\n\n\n\"We need to go,\" you mutter, not knowing what else to say.\n\n\n\"What... what about him?\" Joseph asks weakly.\n\n\n\"We need to fucking go, Joseph!\" you say, tears filling your eyes. \n\n\nYou grab Joseph\u0027s arm, yanking him away as the two of you rush down the street. Sean McGarry doesn\u0027t move, sitting in the street and crying. You rush down the streets as quickly as you can, until you\u0027re far away from the scene of that incident and you\u0027re left completely unable to run any further. You look at Joseph, staring at him with a pit growing in your stomach.\n\n\n\"What... what did we do, Joseph?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We couldn\u0027t... we didn\u0027t know,\" Joseph says meekly. \"We didn\u0027t know what...fuck, Christ above forgive us.\"\n\n\n\"We... we need to get out of here,\" you say.\n\n\nIt\u0027s a long, dark walk back to the farm.

Was any of it worth it?\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s not a question for us to answer. History will answer that. Our children will answer that. Us? It\u0027s not our place to determine where we sat in history. Who knows, maybe they\u0027ll sing songs about us.\"\n\n\n\"It better be a song of sorrows. Anything else would be a lie. The war for a republic has ended, and it didn\u0027t even end in a Republic,\" Joseph says. \"Only dead fools who didn\u0027t deserve to end up that way.\"\n\n\n\"The war\u0027s not over, Joseph,\" you say. \"It\u0027ll just be fought by politicians now.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s not war,\" Joseph says. \"War leaves mothers, wives and daughters crying by coffins. War sends young men, young boys, charging into battle. War burns...\"\n\n\nJoseph pauses, the words getting caught in his throat.\n\n\n\"... War burns kids in their sleep. I\u0027m glad the war\u0027s over, Michael. I want freedom. I want independence. I want a republic. But I don\u0027t want this.\"\n\n\n\"Well then, we\u0027ll celebrate peace,\" you say. \"Hopefully, it\u0027ll last, and we can look back on this a few years down the line as bad times. That we got through.\"\n\n\n\"Hopefully,\" Joseph smiles weakly. \"Hopefully.\"\n",
  "page 415": "The war does not continue. Shortly after, negotiations begin between the Republican Government and the British government. President of Dáil Eireann, Eamon DeValera, visits London four times, before finally a delegation is sent over for negotiations.\n\n\nNegotiating for Britain was Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Lord Chancelor Lord Birkenhead, Leader of the House of Commons Austen Chamberlain, Secrety of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Attorney General Sir Gordon Hewart and Chief Secretary for Ireland Sir Hamar Greenwood.\n\n\nOn the Irish side, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and famed nationalist politician Arthur Griffith is chairman, accompanied by Secretary of Finance and military general Michael Collins, Secretary for Economic Affairs Robert Barton, and two Members of British Parliament and members of Dáil Eireann, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy.\n\n\nStrangely, President of Dáil Eamon DeValera chooses not to attend. Although reasons were not given, there\u0027s rumors that he knew whatever deal the Irish delegation could manage to argue for would certainly be far less than wanted, and he wanted someone to pin the blame on. \n\n\nThe negotiations are long and hard. The Anglo-Irish Treaty is devised, but it involves both sides sacrificing quite a bit. The Irish delegation refuses to sign it without consulting DeValera and the Dáil. Eventually, under threat of taking the two countries to war again, a final ultimatum is made: sign the treaty, or continue the war. With little choice, the delegation takes the former option. \n\n\nThe Treaty was a long, complicated document, but the main things were these: Crown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland. Ireland was to become a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, similar to Australia, Canada or South Africa. The British King would be the Head of State of the new state, known as the Irish Free State, or Saorstát Éireann. The new free state\u0027s parliament would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State. The more Protestant, Unionist Northern Ireland would would withdraw from the Free State, becoming it\u0027s own dominion of Britain with it\u0027s own parliament. Britain would control a number of Treaty Ports in Ireland. Ireland would draft it\u0027s own constitution giving it power of itself, but Britain would decide it\u0027s policies in terms of foreign affairs and war.\n\n\nThe treaty was met with a mixed bag. In many ways, it was far more than anyone had dreamed of before 1916. On the other hand, the idea of a free, independent Irish Republic was what many men had fought for, and was what many men had died for. Many saw it as a betrayal of principle to bow down to the crown after what they\u0027d done. \n\n\nThere\u0027s along debate in the Dáil, with Eamon DeValera leading the anti-Treaty side. The threat of war was used as evidence that the treaty was signed under duress and did not stand. In the end, the final vote was 64 to 57 in favor of the treaty. DeValera resigned as president in protest, to be replaced by Arthur Griffith. Many anti-treaty TDs left the Dáil, refusing to swear the Oath of Allegiance that would be necessary to stay in the Dáil. It became clear that there were serious divisions in the community. These divisions run through your community.\n\n\nYou stand in Fionn\u0027s farmhouse, discussing plans with him. The debate has been long and hard on what your unit has done. The IRA is to be disbanded, to be replaced by the National Army of the Irish Free State. As soldiers in the IRA, you\u0027re all offered positions in the army. However, many anti-treaty IRA officers have refused this offer, staying in the \"new\" IRA that refuses to acknowledge the treaty or the Dáil, for betraying the Irish republic they swore loyalty to. The path forward is being debated.\n\n\n\"This is more than we could ever get,\" Fionn says. \"If we oppose this, we\u0027ll be crushed. We don\u0027t have the arms or numbers to continue fighting.\"\n\n\n\"We didn\u0027t in the rising either!\" Joseph says. \"But we fought on, and good men gave their lives for the republic! Not this pathetic offering!\"\n\n\n\"The Dáil we pledged ourselves to voted in favor of this,\" Fionn says. \"We have a duty to serve.\"\n\n\n\"Damn right we do!\" Sean says. \"We swore a duty to the republic! We\u0027ll stand by it!\"\n\n\n\"Michael Collins\u0027 defended his view at the Dáil,\" Liam says. \"I was there. We\u0027re not abandoning the republic. He said this is only a stepping stone, but the path forward is through politics. We can\u0027t fight anymore but with our votes!\"\n\n\n\"Our votes?!\" Sean says. \"Did that get us anywhere in the past?!\"\n\n\n\"The new IRA has called for all true sons and daughters of the republic to serve them. I stand with them!\" Joseph says. \n\n\n\"That\u0027s a massacre. We\u0027ll be massacred if we go to war. We couldn\u0027t fight on,\" Fionn defends.\n\n\n\"We could\u0027ve fought on! We can fight on! I refuse to bow to the tyranny of the British crown, until the flag of the Republic of Ireland flies over the Dáil! Enough men died for us to fight on to see it happen!\" Joseph shouts.  \n\n\n\"Michael!\" Fionn says, looking to you. \"You\u0027ve stayed silent. Care to make your opinions known?\"\n",

There\u0027s a frantic yell, as you\u0027re left running desperately to escape the machine gun fire.\n\n\nA bullet slams into your ankle, sending you stumbling to the ground.

The building burns for five whole days, being completely destroyed by fire. Although it\u0027s a huge propaganda victory, it\u0027s a serious military loss. Not a single British soldier or police officer was killed, while on the Irish side, the losses were intense. Five men killed, with 80 being captured after the undersupplied force ran out of ammo. Commander Tom Ennis managed to escape, but took two bullets to the leg. It soon becomes clear that the war is being lost.\n\n\nAll you can do is continue fighting.

You all stand around him, listening to him talk.\n\n\n\"We need to do some serious damage, and hurt them where it\u0027ll matter. Their pockets. We\u0027re going to send soldiers over to England, to show them that the war will hurt them just as much as us.

The war... it\u0027s over!\"\n\n\n\"A truce?\" Tom Ennis asks.\n\n\n\"Eamon DeValera and the other Dáil politicians have organized a truce.\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a murmur of discussions breaking out from among the group.\n\n\n\"Thank god,\" Joseph says to you. \"We could use a break from the fighting.

The machine gun quickly zeroes in on the few of you, machine gun fire crackling as bullets fly through the air, zipping through the air. You awkwardly run forward, trying to avoid the bullets. The O\u0027Rahilly has bullets slamming into his chest as he twists and shakes under the gunfire, collapsing to the ground in a pool of blood. He lies there, spluttering and wounded.\n\n\n\"Fuck!

  "page 656": "The next few months are spent desperately trying to hide out, protecting your arms and trying to avoid arrest. Now that the central anti-Treaty IRA forces have surrendered, the Free State\u0027s law and enforcement has increased to a huge degree, making it far harder to stay hidden, let alone perform attacks. Eventually, however, you manage to secure equipment, and a target. You manage to steal an armored car from a Free State military base via forged credentials, as well as using stockpiled weapons stolen during th remain chunk of the Treaty War, to prepare an attack on the HMS Scythe in Queenstown, formerly Cobh in it\u0027s Irish tongue, one of the three Treaty Ports that exists . You plan an assault on the British warship, in hope of sparking a brutal retaliatory attack from them on the Irish populace. This could remotivate the IRA to oppose them, and perhaps even bring the Free State over and create an international issue.\n\n\nYou sit in the drivers seat of the armored car, driving down the back roads of Queenstown towards the famous port that\u0027ll be your target. The others in the car are all dedicated warriors of the cause, all brutal fighters who\u0027ve lost a lot in the war to independence. Casey, the gunner, lost three brothers in the Easter Rising, one a civilian who was just watching the fighting from their home, and lost his pregnant wife to a Black and Tan attack. The two riflemen in the back, the O\u0027Riordan brothers, lost multiple cousins, their father and their sister. It\u0027s clear that you\u0027re all willing to die for the cause. \n\n\nThe armored car begins coming up on the port, but it\u0027s Free State details mean it\u0027s not stopped or doesn\u0027t cause any suspicion. You soon make out the HMS Scythe, a large Destroyer that sits docked to the port. Most of the crew is up top with civilian dock workers, making preparation for launch. You drive up to them, getting the widest range of fire. Then, you stop and the gun slowly turns to aim. There\u0027s a brief pause, before it begins.\n\n\nThe burst of machine gun fire begins from the top, a thunderous roar as the gun\u0027s maw fires streams of lead to cut down the British enemy and their collaborators who betrayed the nation. You watch, as they\u0027re hurriedly \n\n\nFor a brief moment, adrenaline floods through you, as you watch the sailors are gunned down on mass. \n\n\nYou pause, however, as you realize what\u0027s actually going on, staring out at who you\u0027re shooting at. Not British soldiers occupying Irish villages, but simple sailors in the British Navy returning home, mainly, who are unprepared for the attack, thinking their days of fighting were over. Civilians, who just happen to be at the dock, who the gunner appears to be firing at indiscriminately. \n\n\nYou\u0027re massacring civilians, not waging war. This isn\u0027t justice, this is hatred. This isn\u0027t an attempt to gain independence, but an attempt to shed blood.\n\n\nThe enemy, those with guns, begin returning with heavy fire. \n\n\nYou slow down the armored car, as bullets thud off it. You let out a sigh, swinging open the door, and giving the soldiers outside a clear shot at you. \n\n\nYou\u0027d like to have thought you were dying as a martyr, but you died as a villain.\n",
  "page 659": "After the war ends, it seems there\u0027s finally a chance at peace. The Free State treats the anti-treaty rebels surprisingly well, and they\u0027re released after sometime.

Childers, who would go on to be president. His father, Robert Erskine Childers, ran guns for the very first Volunteers, and was executed for holding arms in the civil war. \n\n\nAfter the war, you begin to rebuild the newfound nation.

We are being watched,\" Rory smirks. \"Calm down and stop drawing attention to us.\" \n\n\n\"But...!\" you begin to say, before taking a deep breath to calm yourself down. \"Why...?\"\n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t. It\u0027s this old Irish thing from way back before even the Celts. It\u0027s called a joke.\"\n\n\n\"Ha-ha, very fucking funny,\" you say, your face darkening as you feel embarrassed at your outburst.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I though so,\" Rory smiles smugly. \n\n\nYou continue walking along the streets, but it\u0027s not long before you notice a shawled figure, leaning behind an old bar. The figure\u0027s head immediately bounces up as you walk by, and it watches you with interest. The figure slowly creeps out towards the street, remaining in the shadows as it clearly focuses on you alone.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re being tailed,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Take it easy, Michael. Are you sure you\u0027re OK?\" Joseph asks.\n\n\nWhilst you might be the boy who cried wolf on this one, you have a duty to protect this letter. If that figure is an informant, it\u0027ll take them but a moment to get some constables to search you, and there\u0027s a nearby police station nearby, so it wouldn\u0027t be long before you were swarmed. It\u0027s best you act as soon as possible.\n",
  "page 539": "It has become clear that the rising has failed. With too few men, too few supplies and the hastily relocated headquarters barely being capable to keeping the thing together, there\u0027s little chance of success.\n\n\nMore importantly that are the heavy casualties. Not among the rebels, of course, and certainly not among the enemy, but it\u0027s the deaths of those not involved in the fight that hits hardest. The British have been committing more than a few atrocities against the civilian populace of Ireland, executing men without trial for simply being associated with a rebel, . This indiscriminate shelling of the city has led to a huge level of losses. \n\n\nTo ask soldiers to fight and die for the cause is necessary. There\u0027s to be no regrets when a soldier gives his life for Ireland. But civilians? Men, women and children who didn\u0027t join this? Their deaths are a horror. With more civilians dying that Rebels and Loyalists alike, they\u0027re the true victim of the war. \n\n\nSean McLoughin attempts to organize a break-out to take back enemy positions, but this is vetoed by Padraig Pearse, who fears that this will just prolong the inevitable and lead to further serious loss of civilian life. \n\n\nThus, a message is drafted, to be sent out to the various rebel cells across the city and in the outer areas, to be carried by a nurse, Elizabeth O\u0027Farrell. It reads:\n\n\n\"In order to prevent the further slaughter of Dublin citizens, and in the hope of saving the lives of our followers now surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered, the members of the Provisional Government present at headquarters have agreed to an unconditional surrender, and the commandants of the various districts in the City and County will order their commands to lay down arms.\"\n\n\nAfter that, Padraig Pearse heads out, to surrender to the British General William Lowe, and with that, the rebellion officially comes to an end with a weak whimper. Still, you march out proudly with your head held high as you\u0027re taken prisoner on mass. You refuse to let them break them, refuse to let them see how weak you are. \n\n\nWith that, you proudly march out into the streets, your weapons surrendered, you\u0027re taken prisoner. You\u0027re left their, at the mercy of the British soldiers as you\u0027re rounded up. You find yourself standing next to Joseph and a badly wounded James Connolly, who is being held by two soldiers. He\u0027s incapable of standing, lying there badly wounded. You doubt he\u0027ll last very long.\n\n\n\"Well, Michael, I\u0027m sorry it had to come to this,\" Joseph says, sad but determined.\n\n\n\"It was always going to end this way,\" you say. \n\n\n\"We\u0027ll die heroes, at least,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re going to kill us?\" a soldier asks meekly. \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry,\" James Connolly says, stirring from his pained sleep and having a moment of clarity. \"Those of us that signed the proclamation will be shot. But the rest of you will be set free.\"\n\n\nThe soldier nods, as James Connolly smiles, before quickly collapsing back into sleep. \n\n\nYou\u0027re rounded up, your arms taken as the British hurry to organize this mass surrender. You\u0027re all taken away, as they attempt to separate the rank and file rebel soldiers from the leaders of this insurrection. It\u0027s not hard. The rebel leaders make no attempt to hide, proudly declaring their goals and their achievements in serving the cause. They\u0027re taken away to private locations, where they\u0027ll no doubt be tried and executed as soon as can be. \n\n\nYou\u0027re soon spread out between the local jails, where you\u0027re held temporarily. However, it\u0027s not long before the British realize that holding you on your own territory, where your supporters still remain, isn\u0027t the best idea. Instead, a few cargo ships are converted to prison ships, where they\u0027ll take you across the channel. If the British are lucky, German boats will sink you and send you to a watery grave so you don\u0027t have to be dealt with. If not, you\u0027re to be taken to a POW camp designed for German soldiers, where you\u0027ll be held, somewhere in Wales. The German POWs held there are being moved, and you\u0027ll instead stay there. Your destination is a place known as Frongoch, although you\u0027ve never heard of it. You have no idea how long you\u0027ll stay there, but you can only hope you\u0027ll be getting out of there, and if you\u0027re lucky, it won\u0027t be in a coffin. \n\n\nYou sit in the bowels the ship, trying to stay calm as you face the idea of leaving Ireland for the first time in your life. You\u0027re in a tight, barred area reserved for cargo, sitting in one of the bunks crammed in there, surrounded by other men just like you. You\u0027re nervous, terrified, even, but you\u0027re trying to hide it, as is every man there. Well, that is, every man there besides one.\n\n\n\"Well? How did it go?\" a dark haired, surprisingly cheerful man says out loud, drawing your attention, and everyone else\u0027s\n\n\nYou pause, as you recognize the man as the man who captured that British soldier the O\u0027Rahilly talked to. Michael Collins was his name, you think.\n\n\n\"How did what go?\" someone asks, confused.\n\n\n\"Why, the Easter Rising, of course,\" he smiles. \"We need to learn from our failures of his whole thing for the next time.\"\n\n\n\"Next time?\" you ask. \"What next time? It\u0027s over. We lost.\"\n\n\n\"This isn\u0027t the end,\" Michael Collins says. \"This is the start. We\u0027ve lit the fire, but now we need to continue. I\u0027d say we\u0027re about ready to begin planning the next take over. This is just the beginning, I promise you that.\"\n\n\nYou nod, feeling slightly more prepared for the trip to Wales, as all you rebels begin plotting for the next great rebellion.\n",
  "page 660": "Over the next few months, the treaty war gets more and more out of hand, spiraling out of control. It\u0027s not long before it becomes clear that the IRA are losing, and the Free State are soon going to triumph. \n\n\nOut of prison, you get to see Ma and Mary once again. Mary\u0027s had her boy, a little lad named Morgan. Although you don\u0027t get to see much of them due to being on the run with the others, given that your name and face is down on a registry of escaped anti-Treaty criminals, but it\u0027s nice to see them for even a little bit.\n\n\nHowever, like every war, there are casualties. Arthur Griffith, overworked and strained from constant stress in keeping the government running smoothly while keeping Britain appeased, dies from heart failure leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Only ten days later, at Béal na Bláth, Michael Collins is assassinated in an IRA ambush, where he is the only loss.\n\n\nAfter losing two great leaders, the Free State becomes far more draconian in it\u0027s work in ending this whole blasted war., including performing executions without trials, larger scale internment and the criminalization of holding any arms whatsoever. This leads to the execution of Erskine Childers, the man who first ran guns for the Irish Volunteers, after he was found with a pistol that he claimed was a gift form Michael Collins. His last words become famous. As he stared down the firing squad to execute him, he said \"Take a step forward, lads. It\u0027ll be easier that way.\" If nothing else, the man went out with style.\n\n\nAs the war gets more brutal, it becomes clear Ireland as a nation will not last unless this comes to an end soon.\n\n\nIn an attempt to influence the political background here, you\u0027ve been ordered to head down to the house of adamant pro-Treaty TD Seán McGarry. Whilst he\u0027s away on business leaving the house unoccupied, you\u0027re to set fire to the place and burn it down to the ground, to hopefully scare the TD into ending his support for the treaty. \n\n\nYou drive a small truck down the back road to McGarry\u0027s large country house. Like you were told, the place is empty, with no cars out front. You pull over, clambering out of the car to grab the two big cannisters of gasoline in the back. \n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get to work, then,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You know,\" Joseph suggests. \"We could rob this place before we burn it down. You know, take out a few valuables. They\u0027d be destroyed anyway...\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re professionals,\" you say. \"We should just be burning this place down, not looting like criminals.\"\n\n\n\"No one would know.\"\n\n\n\"Joseph!\"\n\n\n\"Oh, damn it! Seriously?\" he asks. \"God, you\u0027re too professional.\"\n",
  "page 200": "\"You group the main few soldiers at one point, so that their firepower is consolidated and there\u0027s an element of surprise for all the soldiers. However, you have a pair of them further up the road, scouting ahead to wait to see the convoy passing through.\"\n\n\n\"Ah, but we\u0027re not equipped with any equipment to communicate other than shouting. No messenger pigeons for us, this isn\u0027t the trenches. So as the convoy bursts through, the scouts won\u0027t be able to get any information on numbers or arms or convoy size to the main bulk. Really, you\u0027re just losing two men who can\u0027t do anything. No, the ideal system we have, like the one used at the Soloheadbeg Ambush, is to have a primary body at the ambush point. They attack in superior numbers, wiping out the enemy, but if the enemy, try to blow on straight through and drive on, have two more men further up ahead to eliminate the drivers if they try to escape. That\u0027s the system we go with.\"\n\n\nThe soldiers all nod thoughtfully, as you nod as well.\n\n\n\"That\u0027s the tactic we\u0027re going to use to deal with the RIC convoy we\u0027re going to be raiding. That\u0027s our plan. The gracious Michael Collins have given us information on a weapons convoy we\u0027re going to hit.\"\n\n\nQuite a few of the men around you nod eagerly. Apparently, Michael Collins has made quite a reputation for himself in Frongoch, and now as the Minister of Finance of Dáil Eireann, a commander of the IRA, and director of information, he\u0027s a very powerful man. He controls vast networks of informants, and a near mystical group of assassins known as the Squad, or the Twelve Disciples, that hunt down spies and informants as well as performing assassinations.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re going to hit them to fully arm this group. Until then, we\u0027re using weapons borrowed from Liam Lynch and the No. 2 Cork Brigade. We\u0027re going to hit in the formation discussed, and wipe out the convoy.

The locations of various RIC barracks and where the presence of the British army is strongest, as well as the area that this branch was expected to deal with, a large section of outer and rural Dublin. It\u0027s going to be hard work, and you\u0027re under-supplied, under-armed and under-supported, but most importantly, you\u0027re underestimated. The Crown think the problem in Ireland is a bunch of peasants mucking about in their pigsties, trying to rise up without knowing what they\u0027re doing. \n\n\nThey\u0027ll learn never to underestimate an Irishman.\n",
  "page 321": "\"Throw the second grenade!\" you yell, although in the din of battle, no one seems to hear you, or be willing to waste the second grenade in this action.\n\n\nThe Auxiliary slams into you, knocking you into the dust. In a frantic melee, the man slams the butt of his rifle into your face, breaking your nose instantly. He slams it down again, and again, brutally beating you about the face. He steps back, raising his rifle and firing, killing you instantly.\n\n\nAlthough the Kilmichael Ambush is a historic victory, unfortunately you count yourself among the few casualties. \n",
  "page 442": "You raise your hand, as does Liam. However, every other IRB member keeps there hand lowered. Liam looks around, realizing how unpopular he\u0027s made himself, and looks at the floor in shame.\n\n\n\"Michael!\" Joseph says, his voice dripping with disappointment.\n\n\nYou pause, lowering your hand, ashamed. \n\n\n\"Well then,\" Seamus says. \"The issue\u0027s been put to a vote, and we\u0027re going to war.\"\n\n\nSeamus stares at you for a second, frowning.\n\n\n\"The only question left is if there\u0027s any men who are still unwilling to fight,\" Seamus says.\n\n\nThe question is left hanging in the air, as you stare at Seamus. You\u0027re under-supplied, you have far less soldiers than you\u0027d have hoped for, and even with both of those a successful rebellion would\u0027ve been hard to pull off. Are you willing to risk your life just for this?\n",
  "page 563": "\"Drive forward,\" you order. \"We need to draw attention from the machine gunners!\" \n\n\nThe Mutineer rolls forward, as you continue firing on the Free State soldiers. You do successfully draw the enemies away from the machine gun positions, allowing them to reload. However, it\u0027ll take a minute for these untrained gunners to reload the weapons, and that\u0027s more than you have. The Free State soldiers rush the armored car from cover, moving in too close for you to be able to hit them with a burst of machine gun fire.\n\n\nYou draw your pistol, attempting to take them out with some close range fire, before one of them lobs a grenade into the Mutineer through your machine gun position. You let out a terrified scream, having only a moment to react.\n",
  "page 684": "Over the next few weeks, the anti-Treaty forces begin regrouping and making plans, as hostilities rise. They attempt to recruit and find arms, but there\u0027s little actual engagements. The fighting is kept to small-time raids and ambushes. It\u0027s clear that no one really wants to kill their fellow countrymen, their comrades, their friends, their family. \n\n\nEventually, after several tours defending the area from potential IRA ambushers and attacks, you return home, where you meet with your family, including the newest addition to the family, Morgan, Mary and Arthur\u0027s child. Well, not exactly Mary and Arthur\u0027s, but... still. \n\n\nIt\u0027s good to return home to be with your family, and you\u0027ve a few weeks leave, so you might finally get a break from the constant cycle of violence and bloodshed and killing.\n",
  "page 320": "You get low, charging in with your bayonet raised. The Auxiliary lets out a yell as you slam into him, thrusting your bayonet upwards as you jab it between his ribs and into his soft stomach. You pull out the blade with a sickening squelch as the man falls to the ground with a desperate scream. You jab the bayonet into his throat, plunging it into the soft flesh as you hack open his throat with a torrent of blood. The Auxiliary\u0027s screams turn to wet squelching, and that turns to silence quickly after. \n\n\nYou look up, to see the first lorry of nine officers has been easily wiped out. You don\u0027t think you see a single loss on your side. The second lorry has already stopped at position two, and is exchanging fire with them.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go help those bastards!\" Tom Barry yells.\n\n\nThe group quickly rushes down the road to position two, where the Auxiliaries stand a chance. That is, until you arrive. You quickly take cover as you arrive at the second lorry, opening fire. There\u0027s a short, brutal exchange of firefire. You quickly see an IRA man, foolishly crouched halfway out of cover, shot in the head and killed instantly.\n\n\n\"For god\u0027s sake, surrender!\" Tom Barry screams. \"No more men need to die!\"\n\n\n\"We surrender, we surrender!\" a voice among the Auxiliaries calls out, as the gunfire stops. \"We surrender, hold your fire!\"\n\n\n\"Thank Christ,\" Tom Barry mutters. \"I\u0027m sending men over to collect your rifles. You are now officially prisoners of the Irish Republic.\"\n",
  "page 441": "You march with Joseph, rifle in hand, down the empty streets of early morn. It\u0027s not long before you reach a huge amassing of people from the Irish Volunteers, the female branch Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army. You quickly find Seamus, who is attempting to organize this whole affair.\n\n\n\"Ah, McCarthy brothers!\" Seamus says, turning with a grin.\n\n\n\"Seamus,\" you say. \"Are we ready?\"\n\n\n\"Of course, boys. Do ye have ammo?\"\n\n\n\"I do,\" you nod eagerly.\n\n\n\"Good. You\u0027ll need it,\" he says. \"Best of luck, boys. For Eireann.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re handed a black brimmer hat, as well as a yellow Volunteer armband and a bandolier. You\u0027re also handed a spare grenade, which you slide into your satchel. The groups break away, splitting off into the various designated group.\n\n\nThe plan is simple. Take Dublin City centre. There\u0027s a large, oval-shaped area between the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, with the River Liffyrunning through the middle. You\u0027re to set up, barricade and prepare to force back any British assaults until... well, that seems to be the unanswered question on everyone\u0027s mind.\n\n\nYou\u0027re left with the largest group, made up of 400 Irish Volunteers and men of the Irish Citizen Army. You watch as the leaders of this group assemble in front of you, standing up on some old city steps as they stare at their group.\n\n\nTom Clarke, an elderly, bespectacled man with a thick grey mustache stands on the far left. The man\u0027s been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood for 38 years, and despite his age, the man\u0027s possibly the most powerful man in the IRB.\n\n\nTo Clarke\u0027s right is Seán Mac Diarmada. The man beams at the men assembled before him, an ecstatic look on his face. He nods to those around him. He leans heavily on a cane, which at his young age can only be from a bout of polio. As one of the most prominent promoters of the Irish language and culture, as well as a national organizer for Sinn Féin and the manager of the Irish Freedom newspaper, he\u0027s well known by everyone there.\n\n\nNext is Joseph Mary Plunkett. The young, timid, bespectacled man is an affluent poet, although his loyalty to the cause is well known. Plunket was the man who traveled secretly to Germany, making plans with Roger Casement and the German government to secure arms and POWs. Although his plans have gone up in flames due to Casement\u0027s capture, the man seems more unnerved by the attention than the actual idea of fighting. You know his family, despite being more than rich enough to turn their head at the plight of the common man, have pledged their loyalty to the cause, with two of his brothers fighting today and his father having turned some of his property into a training camp for IRB soldiers.\n\n\nNext is Pádraig Pearse, who stands proud and determined. He\u0027s the most powerful figure in the Volunteers here, which for a simple teacher is impressive. The man\u0027s been the mastermind of the entire Easter Rising, and seems to look out at the crowd with a fierce spirit. His brother, Willie Pearse, is also fighting today. There\u0027s not a man in the crowd who isn\u0027t familiar with Pearse\u0027s contributions to the cause of Irish nationalism.\n\n\nFinally, there\u0027s James Connolly, the commander of this unit. He\u0027s a middle-aged, balding man with a great thick mustache, who almost seems unassuming. However, as an ex-British soldier, a militant socialist who founded the Irish Citizen Army and fought hard for the rights of the downtrodden and the poor, he\u0027s a hero to the common man. As a huge supporter of the rights of women, saying \"the female is the slave of the slave\", he\u0027s even gotten quite a great deal of support from the women here, noted when they cheer the loudest as he steps forward.\n\n\nYour attention temporarily switches to the women of Cumann na mBan, the woman\u0027s equivalent of the Irish volunteers. They\u0027ve come today to help with the organization of the rebellion, to work as couriers, medics and procure arms and rations.\n\n\nOf course, not all of them are so content to \"help out\" in the rising. The Irish Citizen Army allows female soldiers, and there\u0027s a few there, armed with rifles. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! Would you be so kind as to give me a moment\u0027s attention?\" James Connolly booms.\n\n\nImmediately, over 400 people go silent, staring at the figure in front of them. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re here today for one reason: freedom! The Irish people have been stepped on, downtrodden, and abused for centuries. The British will not give us our language, they will not give us our culture, they will not give us our parliament. Thus, we are here today to take what is rightfully ours.\"\n\n\nJames Connolly pauses for a moment, surveying the crowd.\n\n\n\"The Irish cause is one dear to my heart. It\u0027s dear to all of our hearts. Together, we have a duty to do what\u0027s best for the nation of Ireland. We do not fight for ourselves, but for our children, and our children\u0027s children. Every Irish child, here and abroad, will remember the tale of the men who fought today, for freedom, for independence, for Eireann!\"\n\n\nJames Connolly sticks his chin up, looking proudly at the group.\n\n\n\"Now, we don\u0027t have a moment to waste. All across the city, our forces prepare for the takeover. Let\u0027s do our part, and secure the GPO for the Irish Republic!\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a reply of thunderous applause, before you quickly take up marching. It\u0027s not long before you reach the GPO, marching proudly up the steps as you head toward the building, passersby realizing what\u0027s going on and frantically rushing home.\n\n\n\"Come on, inside!\" Connolly yells.\n",
  "page 562": "You stay in the armored truck, firing bursts of machine gun fire to hold the advancing Free State soldiers back the advancing enemies. You manage to prevent the advancing enemy line from pushing on, as the machine guy positions combined with the Mutineer makes short work of any fool too stupid to take cover. You pause, realizing the Free State soldiers aren\u0027t just retreating from your machine gun fire, but seem to be retreating entirely. You crack a grin, smiling at this as you...\n\n\n\"Shit! Artillery!\" a scream comes out, as you hear the whistling of incoming shells.\n\n\nYou dive from your gunner\u0027s spot inside the Mutineer, as the first shell rocks the car, nearly knocking it spinning over as it\u0027s wheels are eviscerated with a burst of shrapnel. You wait patiently, as artillery thumps around you, smashing into the ground with explosions tearing through the ground for several minutes, before the artillery barrage ends.\n\n\nAfter a few moments, the artillery barrage stops. You cautiously wait a moment, before popping your head up and grabbing the machine gun, ready for an enemy charge.\n\n\n\"The wheels are gone. This whole thing\u0027s completely immobilized,\" the driver says. \"We\u0027re stuck here.\"\n\n\n\"Shit,\" you complain. \"Just... let me think.\"\n\n\nAbandoning the Mutineer will allow the Free State forces to push up and push your men entirely back into the buildings of the Four Courts, where you\u0027ll be easily crushed. \n",

  "page 446": "You march with Joseph, rifle in hand, down the empty streets of early morn. It\u0027s not long before you reach a huge amassing of people from the Irish Volunteers, the female branch Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army. You quickly find Seamus, who is attempting to organize this whole affair.\n\n\n\"Ah, McCarthy brothers!\" Seamus says, turning with a grin.\n\n\n\"Seamus,\" you say. \"Are we ready?\"\n\n\n\"Of course, boys. Do ye have ammo?\"\n\n\n\"I do,\" you nod eagerly.\n\n\n\"Good. You\u0027ll need it,\" he says. \"Best of luck, boys. For Eireann.\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re handed a black brimmer hat, as well as a yellow Volunteer armband and a bandolier. You\u0027re also handed a spare grenade, which you slide into your satchel. The groups break away, splitting off into the various designated group.\n\n\nThe plan is simple. Take Dublin City centre. There\u0027s a large, oval-shaped area between the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, with the River Liffyrunning through the middle. You\u0027re to set up, barricade and prepare to force back any British assaults until... well, that seems to be the unanswered question on everyone\u0027s mind.\n\n\nYou\u0027re left with the largest group, made up of 400 Irish Volunteers and men of the Irish Citizen Army. You watch as the leaders of this group assemble in front of you, standing up on some old city steps as they stare at their group.\n\n\nTom Clarke, an elderly, bespectacled man with a thick grey mustache stands on the far left. The man\u0027s been a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood for 38 years, and despite his age, the man\u0027s possibly the most powerful man in the IRB.\n\n\nTo Clarke\u0027s right is Seán Mac Diarmada. The man beams at the men assembled before him, an ecstatic look on his face. He nods to those around him. He leans heavily on a cane, which at his young age can only be from a bout of polio. As one of the most prominent promoters of the Irish language and culture, as well as a national organizer for Sinn Féin and the manager of the Irish Freedom newspaper, he\u0027s well known by everyone there.\n\n\nNext is Joseph Mary Plunkett. The young, timid, bespectacled man is an affluent poet, although his loyalty to the cause is well known. Plunket was the man who traveled secretly to Germany, making plans with Roger Casement and the German government to secure arms and POWs. Although his plans have gone up in flames due to Casement\u0027s capture, the man seems more unnerved by the attention than the actual idea of fighting. You know his family, despite being more than rich enough to turn their head at the plight of the common man, have pledged their loyalty to the cause, with two of his brothers fighting today and his father having turned some of his property into a training camp for IRB soldiers.\n\n\nNext is Pádraig Pearse, who stands proud and determined. He\u0027s the most powerful figure in the Volunteers here, which for a simple teacher is impressive. The man\u0027s been the mastermind of the entire Easter Rising, and seems to look out at the crowd with a fierce spirit. His brother, Willie Pearse, is also fighting today. There\u0027s not a man in the crowd who isn\u0027t familiar with Pearse\u0027s contributions to the cause of Irish nationalism.\n\n\nFinally, there\u0027s James Connolly, the commander of this unit. He\u0027s a middle-aged, balding man with a great thick mustache, who almost seems unassuming. However, as an ex-British soldier, a militant socialist who founded the Irish Citizen Army and fought hard for the rights of the downtrodden and the poor, he\u0027s a hero to the common man. As a huge supporter of the rights of women, saying \"the female is the slave of the slave\", he\u0027s even gotten quite a great deal of support from the women here, noted when they cheer the loudest as he steps forward.\n\n\nYour attention temporarily switches to the women of Cumann na mBan, the woman\u0027s equivalent of the Irish volunteers. They\u0027ve come today to help with the organization of the rebellion, to work as couriers, medics and procure arms and rations.\n\n\nOf course, not all of them are so content to \"help out\" in the rising. The Irish Citizen Army allows female soldiers, and there\u0027s a few there, armed with rifles. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! Would you be so kind as to give me a moment\u0027s attention?\" James Connolly booms.\n\n\nImmediately, over 400 people go silent, staring at the figure in front of them. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re here today for one reason: freedom! The Irish people have been stepped on, downtrodden, and abused for centuries. The British will not give us our language, they will not give us our culture, they will not give us our parliament. Thus, we are here today to take what is rightfully ours.\"\n\n\nJames Connolly pauses for a moment, surveying the crowd.\n\n\n\"The Irish cause is one dear to my heart. It\u0027s dear to all of our hearts. Together, we have a duty to do what\u0027s best for the nation of Ireland. We do not fight for ourselves, but for our children, and our children\u0027s children. Every Irish child, here and abroad, will remember the tale of the men who fought today, for freedom, for independence, for Eireann!\"\n\n\nJames Connolly sticks his chin up, looking proudly at the group.\n\n\n\"Now, we don\u0027t have a moment to waste. All across the city, our forces prepare for the takeover. Let\u0027s do our part, and secure the GPO for the Irish Republic!\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a reply of thunderous applause, before you quickly take up marching. It\u0027s not long before you reach the GPO, marching proudly up the steps as you head toward the building, passersby realizing what\u0027s going on and frantically rushing home.\n\n\n\"Come on, inside!\" Connolly yells.\n",
  "page 567": "\"We need to fall back!\" you say with a yell.\n\n\nYou quickly clamber out of the armored car, as your driver clambers out with you. The two of you quickly hurry towards back towards the line, shouting at the machine gunners.\n\n\n\"The armored car\u0027s disabled, we need to fall back! Let\u0027s go!\" you scream.\n\n\nYou quickly fall back to the inner defensive line, where it soon becomes clear that the Battle of Dublin is coming to an end, and you\u0027re not the victors. The Free State forces have better weapons, more numbers, and outnumber you. You\u0027ve been pushed back to the inner areas of the Four Courts, and the plan\u0027s changed. No longer do you hope to spark off the war between the British and Irish again. Instead, you\u0027ve started a war between Irishmen. \n\n\nWith few choices left, the remaining rebels, those who haven\u0027t been captured or killed, have little choice. However, you do, as you\u0027re left with the option to help the anti-Treaty leaders escape through a mass break out through using several sympathizers among the pro-Treaty side. However, you can also stay behind as a distraction force, Cathal Brugha, who has volunteered to stay behind to hold off the Free State forces for long enough to escape. As they look for volunteers for both movements, you wonder what\u0027s left to do.\n",

Instantly, one of the men sent to collect the rifles has his head explode, as another is shot in the stomach, chest and arm, collapsing on the ground as he quickly bleeds to death.

In Dublin city center, the area bounded by the Grand Canal and Royal Canal, the rebels make their attack, quickly splitting up to take several key positions in the city, such as the General Post Office, the Four Courts, St Stephen\u0027s Green, Dublin City Hall and South Dublin Union. Within the first day, the British forces had been crushed, with little actual fighting taking place. Padraig Pearse, the leader the of rising, even read a proclamation of the Irish republic, hoisting up a big old flag for the Republic.\n\n\nTuesday, the British sailed a gunship up the river Liffey, allowing them to have artillery support through the entire city. Their forces counter-attacked, striking through the city, with mixed success. Their was heavy shelling, and all you could do is hope that. Ma wept and prayed for Joseph\u0027s life, while Mary suggested searching the city to try bring him home, but you know shells don\u0027t ask your allegiance before going off.\n\n\nBy Wednesday, hundreds of British troops attacked twenty six volunteers in the Mendicity Institute, and they became the first of the rebels to surrender. Impressively, these men had been placed as a diversion to hold the area for a few hours to slow down the British, but had lasted three days. Meanwhile in the assault on Mount Street, seventeen Irish rebels managed to hold off over a thousand British soldiers, taking out 240 British soldiers with only 4 of their own casualties.\n\n\nOf course, after that, the British hit hard. Over the next few days, there was endless brutality, As the British forces push in, they take heavy losses, but do push the rebels back. Eventually, with the combined. Both a lack of numbers, and the high amount of unexpected civilian casualties, either those killed in the shelling, in the crossfire, or those executed in retaliation by the British, meant that the rebels lost their will to fight. \n\n\nOn Saturday, the rebels abandoned their headquarters in the GPO. Shortly after, to avoid further civilian causalities, the rebels officially surrendered, and the Rising drew to a close. 260 civilians lost their lives, although with 126 British soldiers, 82 rebels and 17 police officers.

You quickly take up your position on O\u0027Connell street, taking shelter in an old hotel known as Hamman Hotel. The building\u0027s already in flames when you get there, but it\u0027s the best defensive position, and you\u0027re more likely to be overrun than you are to be forced out by the fire. Your role is now simple: from your barricaded position, you plan to defend from the Free State advance to give more time to the main force, especially the Anti-Treaty leaders, to escape and continue the fight. Although you might not survive, hell, will not survive, you know your death will be for Ireland.\n\n\nYou spend what seems like eternity crouched in cover, your rifle aimed down the street as you fire at anyone who nears. Eventually, it becomes clear your mission has succeeded: the Free State soldiers have failed to push past after more than enough time for the anti-treaty leaders to escape. Thus, your mission is complete, and all you\u0027re left to do is hold out for as long as you can in what\u0027s to be your last stand.\n\n\nWhilst in the old days of the war, you\u0027d be more than eager to hold out just to spite the enemy, just to kill a few more, just to resist the will of your hated foe. But that\u0027s not the case anymore. Now, you\u0027re fighting Irishmen. You recognize the faces of the enemy, the faces peeking up from cover, the faces staring down the rifle at you, Your enemy isn\u0027t some oppressive foe responsible for endless atrocities: they\u0027re your comrades.\n\n\nAfter a long wait, being pushed out by flames and gunfire, Cathal Brugha makes his decision.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re going to surrender. They\u0027ll treat you fairly, I know they\u0027re good men.\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a moments of protesting, before Brugha holds up a hand to order them to stop.\n\n\n\"You will follow my orders. I won\u0027t have you die for no meaning.\"\n\n\n\"You... you said you,\" you say. \"Not us. What\u0027s to happen you?\"\n\n\nCathal Brugha smirks half-heartedly, as if amused you picked up on that.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not surrendering. I\u0027ll be shot, just like the sixteen of the rising. So I\u0027d prefer to go out on my own terms. I\u0027ll head out there to go down fighting. You\u0027ll surrender. It\u0027s the best way forward.\"\n",

We will shoot you in the head,\" you say.\n\n\nArthur slowly steps to the left, inching towards the gun.\n\n\n\"Arthur...\" you warn.\n\n\nArthur frantically leaps for the gun, wrapping his fingers around it. You go to scream another warning, but it\u0027s drowned out by the shot of Joseph\u0027s gun firing. Arthur\u0027s head snaps back as it explodes against the wall, as you let out a scream.\n\n\n\"What the fuck, Joseph?!\" you yell, rushing over to Arthur.\n\n\nThe limp, heavily bleeding man now lies broken on the ground, his eyes rolled back in his head as the brains that Mary loved him for are now splattered against the wall.\n\n\n\"You said we were going to shoot if he reached for it!\"\n\n\n\"The poor bastard wouldn\u0027t hurt a fly! I doubt he\u0027d ever even fired a gun!\" you say. \"Fuck sake, we need to get out of here.

He\u0027ll never get a proper burial,\" Joseph says.\n\n\nYou pause, knowing you\u0027ve fallen behind schedule because of this. Smoke is beginning to spread through the building as a haze, and it won\u0027t be long before this place becomes a fiery inferno. Plus, by now, local Auxiliaries will already have shown up due to how central a location you\u0027re at, and in number. If you\u0027re going to act, you need to act quick.\n",
  "page 572": "Over the next few months, hostilities rise between the forces of the Irish Free State and the anti-treaty IRA. In February, Ernie O\u0027Malley, the Cork IRA leader who had sheltered you, manages to take over an RIC barracks in Clonmel, capturing 40 police officers and 600 rifles. There\u0027s a stand off between O\u0027Malley and 800 of his anti-treaty IRA and 700 pro-Treaty IRA men under Michael Brennan over who will take over the military barracks in Cork after British soldiers abandoned it, which ends peacefully, thankfully, after the barracks is divided between pro-treaty and anti-treaty forces. Later in Cork, IRA soldiers raise a British ship, taking 1500 rifles, 700 handguns and 60 machine guns. \n\n\nThen, comes when you take action. Led by Cathal Brugha and Rory O\u0027Connor, your old friend, 200 anti-treaty IRA soldiers take over the Four Courts, the center of judicial power in Dublin, in order to show defiance and to provoke a response from the British soldiers in Dublin, hoping that if Britain\u0027s provoked, the Irish will be able to team up again in repelling them and the war can continue. You set up camp in the Four Courts, refusing to leave, as tensions continue to rise. \n\n\nIn May, anti-Treaty soldiers take over the centre of Kilkenny, before being dislodged by 200 Free State soldiers. There\u0027s a firefight, with 18 casualties, before peace reigns again with a truce. In Donegal, there\u0027s another firefight between pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty IRA soldiers, with two deaths. Also in Donegal, a Free State motor convoy is ambushed by Republicans, where one Free State soldier is killed In County Meath, RIC and anti-Treaty fighters clash, with one killed on either side.  The election takes place, with pro-Treaty parties far outdoing anti-treaty parties. Sir Henry Hughes Wilson is assassinated in Britain, although whether it\u0027s by anti-Treaty IRA soldiers or a secret assassination by Michael Collins and the Free State is debated, due to Sir Hughes Wilson being an almost universally hated figure among Irish for his treatment of Irish citizens in the war. However, this forces the British to put pressure on the Free State to dislodge you and the anti-Treaty rebels from the Four Courts.\n\n\nYou\u0027re left waiting nervously to see what the Free State is do, but you\u0027re unwilling to leave the Four Courts and abandon your chance at Irish independence.\n",

The rifle goes off with a bang, as you\u0027re slammed against the wall. You slowly skid down, leaving a large trail of blood going down the wall, groaning as blood begins to pour from the bullet whole in the center of your chest.\n\n\n\"MICHAEL!\" Joseph screams, tossing his rifle aside. \"Michael, you stupid son of a bitch!

You reach the hall again, where everyone found is being forced to kneel by the other. You pause, noticing IRA soldiers are taking up defensive positions, while a lorry carrying hay and petrol has arrived, and these are being spread about the Customs House to make it all the more flammable. Tom Ennis turns, looking at you. \n\n\n\"You two, get to work!\" he says. \"We need all hands on deck!\"\n\n\n\"Get to work doing what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t know,\" Tom Ennis shrugs. \"We need to spread the petrol and hay to successfully burn this place to ash, but we also need guards.

They start at you as you leave,completely disgusted with you, just as you all share the same hatred of them for how cowardly and weak they\u0027re being.

  "page 552": "Over the next six months, the situation changes, surprisingly. While initially, the rebels seem like villains, disturbing the peace and betraying Britain while she faces the evil Huns in the Great War, this quickly changes.\n\n\nEarly on, dozens of cases of atrocities committed by the British come out. Prisoners having been executed in the fighting. The destruction of property out of spite. The use of a pacifist activist as a human shield. Journalists being rounded up and executed by firing quad. Over a dozen civilians being rounded up and shot or bayoneted to death. All of that didn\u0027t even take into account Britain\u0027s indiscriminate shelling of the area. All of this coming to light quickly turns public favor, as makes the rebels, who took care to avoid civilian casualties, seem like the heroes of this uprising. Just as Padraig Pearse wanted, his men didn\u0027t achieve a tactical victory, but have become painted as martyrs for a cause, gaining huge support and lighting the fire of patriotism in the soul of every Irishman there.\n\n\nThen, the British saw fit to execute the sixteen key figures of the rising: Pádraic Pearse, Thomas Clarke, MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, Edward Daly, Michael O\u0027Hanrahan, Willie Pearse, John MacBride, Eamonn Ceantt, Michael Mallin, Sean Heuston, Con Colbert, Thomas Kent, Séan MacDiarmada and James Connolly.\n\n\nThese executions further made the British seem as oppressors rather than peace-keepers. Some of those executed weren\u0027t even leaders of the rising. John MacBride hadn\u0027t been aware of the rising until it began, while Thomas Kent hadn\u0027t participated in it.\n\n\nThe manner of execution was worse. John Connolly was so wounded he had to be tied in a chair to stay standing before his firing squad. Joseph Plunkett married his wife Grace Gifford, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism, seven hours before his execution. They weren\u0027t allowed to speak to each other or touch each other. He was shot later that day. Roger Casement, formerly Sir Roger Casement, a famed humanitarian who had done extensive charity work in Peru and the Congo, was hung, not even being given the soldier\u0027s death of a firing squad.\n\n\nStories like this quickly turned public support in favor of the rebels. Support for Sinn Féin, a nationalist political party, surged, as republicanism gained massive support. It became clear Britain was sitting on a powder keg as it tried to focus on dealing with this. With Sinn Féin rising into power, republicanism on the rise and a desperate longing for independence arising in the Irish zeitgeist, it seems clear that violence is coming. \n\n\nYour life, on the other hand, shifts. Conditions in Frongoch are surprisingly good. However, it seems the intention of the British to quash the rebellious spirit has failed even worse in Wales than back in Ireland. They\u0027ve put together the various rebels from across the country. Most of the rebellion took place in Dublin, but there\u0027s men from all over the country who rebelled. This means that the most radical, nationalist thinkers of the country are allowed to exchange ideas and plan for the future of the country. Connections are made between rebel members from all over Ireland, that\u0027ll allow for a more nationalized movement.\n\n\nAs well as this, the newest branch of nationalist leaders arrives. With the death of the old leaders, this leaves a power vacuum that new men are more than willing ot step into. Men like Michael Collins, Seán McLoughlin, Patrick Daly, W.T. Cosgrave and many more rise up, using charisma and intellect to organize the prisoners. You all practically run the camp yourself, with jobs being organized by these new leaders to put in work together. \n\n\nLife in Frongoch has been surprisingly easy. Surrounded by other Irishmen, you get along surprisingly well, with few issues rising up between prisoners. The workload is shared among men, and you\u0027re treated very well by the British, who are desperate to avoid another propaganda moment arising from your mistreatment. It\u0027s still prison, of course, but hey, it\u0027s not ended too badly, all things considered. Time flies quite quickly, and ultimately, it\u0027s barely even a punishment.\n\n\nIt\u0027s one of of those cold winter days, December 1916. You find yourself right at free time, ready to be released from your cell. Michael Collins is organizing work so that the younger men can fill in for the shifts so that the older men, and thus suffering from long standing injuries don\u0027t have to work. You owe him an extra shift, you could meet with him to get to work. You could also go visit Joseph in his cell, and see how that\u0027s going. Finally, you could go find a guard, attempting to garner some information on the status of your current imprisonment.\n",

The last force taken out is Cathal Brugha and his diversionary attack at O\u0027Connell street.

For all your flanking work, the enemy still escapes, and you can\u0027t just finish this war. \n\n\nThe Battle of Dublin has been a quick, brutal battle. Although it was a decisive win for the National Army, that was always going to be the case, as the IRA troops in the Four Courts were outnumbered twenty times over, with only 200 IRA soldiers facing 4000 Free State Troops. Although the Irish capital city of Dublin was secured by the new government, leaders like Cathal Brugha killed and men like Rory O\u0027Connor, your old friend at the original IRA, and even though the anti-Treaty soldiers were dispersed and their strength broken, many anti-Treaty leaders such as Oscar Traynor, your old friend Ernie O\u0027Malley and many other anti-Treaty fighters managed to escape to continue the fight. With this, the spirit of war managed to survive, and inspired many other anti-Free State units to stand up and oppose the new National Army. \n\n\nYou know this is the start of what\u0027s to be a brutal conflict.

You wait patiently, sweat running down your nervous hands as you continuously wipe the gun dry, as if your sweat will some how magically prevent the gun from working. \n\n\nHowever, the Free State soldiers don\u0027t attack. You\u0027re left standing there, wondering why for quite some time, before you hear the distant booms of cannons... followed by far closer booms as the shells land around you in a burst of explosions.\n\n\n\"Artillery!\" you scream, as a shell lands next to you, sending you flying through the air.\n\n\nYou smack into the hard ground, rolling along the ground. You let out a pained groan, but you\u0027re in one piece, and you don\u0027t even seem to be bleeding despite all the shrapnel sprayed everywhere. It must be some blessed miracle, but you\u0027re alive. You hurry to your feet, as you begin rushing forward with a stumble. You scramble for your machine gun, but the shells continue in another barrage. With the next barrage, another shell lands directly on top of you.\n\n\nThere\u0027s not a second miracle. \n",

Although the Irish capital city of Dublin was secured by the new government, leaders like Cathal Brugha killed and men like Rory O\u0027Connor, your old friend at the original IRA, and even though the anti-Treaty soldiers were dispersed and their strength broken, many anti-Treaty leaders such as Oscar Traynor, your old friend Ernie O\u0027Malley and many other anti-Treaty fighters managed to escape to continue the fight. With this, the spirit of war managed to survive, and inspired many other anti-Free State units to stand up and oppose the new National Army. \n\n\nYou know this is the start of what\u0027s to be a brutal conflict. All you can do is prepare to serve your nation and do the best you can.\n\n\nThis is only the beginning of the bloodshed.

You quickly get involved with the IRA down there, organizing drilling, training and ambushes alongside the vast rebel forces down there.\n\n\nFor the battle of independence, the war gets worst, especially for Cork. In March, the Mayor of Cork is murdered by a group of Black and Tans.  In response to increased internment, Munster and Cork get especially violent. 24 prisoners of war are hung by the British, and Sean Tracey, the man who started this all, is killed in Dublin. In August, Terence MacSwiney, the new Mayor of Cork, dies on a hunger strike, attracting vast international attention.\n\n\nWhen November rolls around, the violence only continues. On the 21st, Bloody Sunday happens. Michael Collins and the Squad, his anti-spy squad, assassinate 14 undercover British Intelligence officers in a single day.

If we reduce attacks, the British will think they can quash out the rebellion here. If they subdue Munster, if they take Cork, this rebellion will falter here as badly as in Ulster. Connaught will be a mop up, and with that, their focus on Dublin will wipe us out completely.\"\n\n\n\"Then what do you suggest?\"\n\n\n\"We attack. We double-down, and hit hard and fast. Make sure those Brits understand that this isn\u0027t going to be easy for them. I\u0027ve already lined up two targets. Tom, I want you to head to Kilmichael shortly, to set up an ambush. It\u0027ll happen a week after the Sunday Massacre. You\u0027re to hit a group of Auxiliaries, around eighteen men. I\u0027ll give you twice that. I want this group blown out of the fucking water. Make sure the Brits know who is fighting this war.\"\n\n\n\"Aye. There\u0027ll be no survivors,\" Tom Barry nods.\n\n\nThe plan for Kilmichael actually represents a serious change in the IRA method of waging war. Rather than small, occasional ambushes from locals, the IRA has began organizing flying columns of soldiers, permanently mobile units of soldiers that stay at various safe-houses to rest and resupply to avoid capture, while hitting hard, aggressive attacks. It\u0027s a show of total war, thanks to the escalation in violence the Black and Tans caused.\n\n\n\"The second ambush I\u0027m planning is a bit more distant.

Two lorries of Auxilaries should be coming down the road, transporting Captain James Kelly, your target. You\u0027re outnumbered and in a busy city center, so you\u0027re going to have to work hard to win, especially since you\u0027ll be trying to minimize civilian casualties, while the Auxilaries won\u0027t necessarily be trying to do the same. Plus, thanks to the fact you\u0027re in a city, you\u0027re not well armed, instead armed with revolvers hidden on your persons, as well as a grenade each, also hidden on your person. \n\n\nSeán O\u0027Donoghue stops, leaning against the wall of a pub and lighting a cigarette.

Many of them are forced to use old-model rifles and pistols, while your forces have top of the line weapons thanks to support from the British Empire. \n\n\nThe IRA soldiers quickly realize their position is failing, and they begin to fall back, desperately trying to escape out of of the Eastern Section.

You\u0027re outnumbered and in a busy city center, so you\u0027re going to have to work hard to win, especially since you\u0027ll be trying to minimize civilian casualties, while the Auxilaries won\u0027t necessarily be trying to do the same. Plus, thanks to the fact you\u0027re in a city, you\u0027re not well armed, instead armed with revolvers hidden on your persons, as well as a grenade each, also hidden on your person. \n\n\nSeán O\u0027Donoghue stops, leaning against the wall of a pub and lighting a cigarette. You quickly move behind a waist-high stone wall with Joseph, finding another two soldiers low down against the wall there. You move next to them, crouching low so you\u0027re hidden from the street view. The last soldier in your six man crew stands next to you, leaning against the wall casually. As you can\u0027t see the road of Seán O\u0027Donoghue, you\u0027re to wait for his signal. Sean O\u0027Donoghue is to slow the head lorry down, and then you strike.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re coming,\" the man against the wall says, staring at the road.\n\n\n\"Hello there, officers!\" you hear Sean O\u0027Donoghue say.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s do this,\" the man leaning against the wall, rising his pistol. \n\n\nYou rise up to see a pair of lorries slowing down in the street. Your comrades release a volley of grenades. Surprisingly, most miss, bouncing off harmlessly against the sides of the truck. One lucky throw lands in the second grenade, going off and immediately disabling the drunk in a burst of smoke as men frantically get out of the vehicle.\n",
  "page 436": "\"Come on,\" you say, clambering out of the vehicle. \"Let\u0027s draw them away. You take the vehicle and draw half of them that way, I\u0027ll draw the other half this way.\"\n\n\nJoseph nods, moving into the driver\u0027s seat and beginning to honk his horn as he disappears down the darkened road. Meanwhile, you quickly begin moving the opposite direction, hoping to get out of there. You rush forward, waiting to get far enough away to be able to get around to luring them off. Unfortunately, you don\u0027t even need to, as the rising sun makes it just about bright enough that you don\u0027t really have a chance.\n\n\n\"I see something! It\u0027s one of them!\" a voice yells in the darkness, no doubt a British soldier.\n\n\n\"Take the shot! He can\u0027t get away!\" another growls.\n\n\nYour chest explodes in a burst of blood. You manage to run another dozen steps, before smacking into the ground. You lie there, your lungs filling with warm blood as you struggle to breath, choking on your own blood. You lie there, dying pitifully, as all you can do is hope that your efforts divert the chase and Casement escapes.\n",
  "page 557": "You hold the line, staying in your position of cover as you take potshots at the Free State soldiers. However, you\u0027re outnumbered and outgunned, and the Free State soldiers know how to take advantage of that. Bullets smack into the stone wall you\u0027ve taken cover behind, and you desperately attempt to switch between crouching into cover and trying to find some way to escape. Bullets thump into the ground around you, as you stay crouched.\n\n\nYou flick out of cover, firing your rifle as you manage to snag a Free State soldier in the thigh, knocking him to the ground and taking one soldier out of the fight. However, the Free State soldiers respond in kind, as bullets thump into your chest.\n\n\nThe bullets burst through your chest, knocking you backwards in a moment. You\u0027re killed instantly, and the Free State soldiers push on without regard, as the Eastern Wing falls.\n",

The last force taken out is Cathal Brugha and his diversionary attack at O\u0027Connell street. Cathal Brugha orders his forces to surrender, before walking out into the street with his pistol raised to die a martyr. With his death, you wait for the main group of anti-Treaty leaders to surrender. \n\n\nHowever, the escape attempt doesn\u0027t come. You quickly hear that the anti-Treaty leaders like Oscar Traynor and Rory O\u0027Connor manage to escape out with large groups of anti-Treaty soldiers through using allies in the National Army, who betray their country to help terrorists and traitors escape. For all your flanking work, the enemy still escapes, and you can\u0027t just finish this war. \n\n\nThe Battle of Dublin has been a quick, brutal battle. Although it was a decisive win for the National Army, that was always going to be the case, as the IRA troops in the Four Courts were outnumbered twenty times over, with only 200 IRA soldiers facing 4000 Free State Troops. Although the Irish capital city of Dublin was secured by the new government, leaders like Cathal Brugha killed and men like Rory O\u0027Connor, your old friend at the original IRA, and even though the anti-Treaty soldiers were dispersed and their strength broken, many anti-Treaty leaders such as Oscar Traynor, your old friend Ernie O\u0027Malley and many other anti-Treaty fighters managed to escape to continue the fight. With this, the spirit of war managed to survive, and inspired many other anti-Free State units to stand up and oppose the new National Army. \n\n\nYou know this is the start of what\u0027s to be a brutal conflict. All you can do is prepare to serve your nation and do the best you can.\n",

Ernie watches him run, nodding.\n\n\n\"Glad we didn\u0027t have to kill them all. There\u0027s a lot of great men who don\u0027t deserve to die on either side of this war. He might\u0027ve been one of them. Now, let\u0027s bring those horses out from where we left them and load up the rifles so we can get out of here,\" Ernie says.\n",
  "page 342": "You shake your head.\n\n\n\"No, Joseph. We can\u0027t. They hopefully won\u0027t kill him. If we get involved, they definitely will, along with us as well.

Let\u0027s go head home.\"\n\n\nIt\u0027s a long walk home through the darkness, as you\u0027re just left feeling worse about the night.

Their rifle fire, bursting out in an exchange of bullets, as you stay in cover, firing back at the advancing Auxiliaries in an attempt to hold them back. You manage to stop them from rushing up to push into the Customs House, although this situation clearly won\u0027t last as you\u0027re low on ammo.\n\n\nIt\u0027s not long before the IRA soldiers around you begin running out of ammo. There\u0027s been little more than half an hour of gunfire, and you\u0027re not able to keep fighting. You crouch behind a pillar outside the Common House, staring at Joseph.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m nearly out,\" you tell him.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m gone,\" Joseph says. \"We need to make a runner. If we surrender, we\u0027ll be executed.\"\n\n\n\"On three?\" you ask, as Joseph nods, determined.\n\n\n\"One, two...!\"\n\n\nYou burst out from cover, sprinting along the columns as you hurry to escape the fire. Rifles explode in the distance, bullets bouncing around you. Suddenly, a bullet slams into your side, knocking you to the ground with a pained yell.\n\n\n\"Get the fuck...!\" Joseph screams, grabbing you. \n\n\nJoseph\u0027s head snaps back as he\u0027s hit in the head. You let out a pained, traumatized scream, grabbing Joseph as he collapses to the ground. You wrap your arms around him, your blow flowing into his, as you hug him tightly. Then, rifle fire ends your suffering.\n",
  "page 103": "You walk through the near empty streets of Dublin, strolling along the River Liffey. All around you are the destroyed wreckages of buildings devastated. Rubble fills the street, forcing you to walk over the chunks of rebar and concrete that fill the street. Bullet holes are thudded into the wall of a building, and you slowly run your fingers along them, peering inside at the pieces of metal still within. You continue to walk, staring around at the wreckage. You walk past the destroyed remains of a barricade, the shining, broken remainders of bayonets lying on the ground, from what must\u0027ve been a serious last charge. \n\n\nThe casualties of war are gone, their bodies dragged off for burial, but the blood still remains to show you how brutal the fighting was. A long smear runs across the road, where a dying man was dragged or tried to crawl away. The larger pool of dried blood tells you that he probably didn\u0027t make it. \n\n\nAlmost immediately, however, life seems to have gone. You watch as a woman pushes a stroller through the streets, narrowly avoiding debris as she coos at her baby. An old couple walks hand in hand down the street, admiring the river as if oblivious to the destruction around them. It\u0027s almost impressive how quickly the Irish people have bounced back.\n\n\nYou continue walking down the street, before you see them. The British have cordoned off a section of the road, and now they\u0027re escorting captured Volunteers down it. You watch as they try to round up the men and escort them down the road towards the trucks that can\u0027t drive through the rubble filled streets.\n\n\nYou look to see if you can recognize anyone from the crowd, but you can\u0027t, attempting to the prisoners.\n",

Not a single British soldier or police officer is killed, while five IRA are killed. However, a shocking 80 men are captured when they run out of ammo, and are unable to continue fighting. Commander Tom Ennis managed to escape, but took two bullets to the leg. However with all you\u0027ve lost, who knows how you\u0027ll be able to continue.\n\n\nThanks to that loss, you have no idea how you\u0027re going to survive thanks to that.

Plus, it\u0027ll be easier to evade capture seeing as they\u0027re not under martial rule.

The war... it\u0027s over!\"\n\n\n\"A truce?\" Tom Ennis asks.\n\n\n\"Eamon DeValera and the other Dáil politicians have organized a truce.\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a murmur of discussions breaking out from among the group.\n\n\n\"Thank god,\" Joseph says to you. \"We could use a break from the fighting. This\u0027ll give us a chance to regroup, recruit and rearm in preparation for the war to start up again.\"\n\n\n\"What makes you so sure the war isn\u0027t over?\" you ask him.\n\n\n\"The British won\u0027t give us what we want. We haven\u0027t pushed them far enough,\" Joseph says. \"This won\u0027t be the end, I\u0027m sure.\"\n\n\n\"I hope you\u0027re wrong, Joseph. I hope you\u0027re wrong.\"\n",

  "page 225": "Over the next few months, the war continues, with you just siting on the sidelines. As the IRA attempts to spread and organize, it\u0027s focus is mainly the founding of the new cells and units, as well as the information war. The British refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Dáil, or even that it\u0027s fighting a war. They claim that it\u0027s simply an enforcement of martial law by the British army as well as a heavy reinforcing and militarization of the police in Ireland. Still, it\u0027s not a particularly brutal war, and there\u0027s hope peace may still come about. All you can hope for is that both sides see reason and this ends.\n\n\nYou stand in the fields, working away as you plant endless seeds. There\u0027s sweat in your brow and a desperate hunger in your stomach, but you\u0027re nearly finished.

Joseph holds a crumpled up letter in his hands. \n\n\n\"Joseph, stop!\" Mary says.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not going to do anything!\" Joseph says. \"I\u0027m just talking to my brother about family business!\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s none of either of your business, Joseph?\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s wrong?\" you ask, tossing down your sack of seeds and strolling towards him.\n\n\n\"Mary\u0027s gone and got herself a suitor.\"\n\n\nYou crack a smile, looking at Mary. \n\n\n\"Anyone we know, Mary?\"\n\n\n\"He goes by the name Arthur,\" Joseph says. \"I\u0027ve a little love letter from him here.\"\n\n\n\"Arthur? That\u0027s hardly a name for an Irishman,\" you say.\n\n\n\"That\u0027s because it\u0027s not, is it? He\u0027s an Englishman, or at least his parents are. Proper unionist, runs the local Irish Unionist party.\" Joseph says. \n\n\n\"If you touch a hair on his head, I\u0027ll take your rifle and shoot you both!\" Mary shouts.\n\n\nAdmittedly, in the past, you have been a bit rough with Mary\u0027s boyfriends. Not because you\u0027re bad people, but she does have a habit of falling in love with various scumbags and villains. But a Unionist is a step worse than even you\u0027d have thought.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll go have a talk with him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"A talk like you had with Seamus, who he ended up with a broken collarbone?\" Mary says, accusatively.\n\n\n\"A talk like we had with Seamus, who we found out was screwing Sarah from the butcher\u0027s behind your back,\" Joseph says.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, we won\u0027t do anything awful,\" you say. \"Let\u0027s go, we\u0027ll head into town.\"\n\n\n\"Michael! I...!\" Mary says, before you hush her.\n\n\n\"I promise, nothing much,\" you lie. \"Why would Joseph or I have any issue with a unionist? Well Joseph, maybe, but me? I couldn\u0027t care less.

You hurry to slip on your cap, moving out to the hallway.

We won\u0027t be fighting,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll need them for protection. If the Black and Tans are on a rampage, it\u0027s better to be safe than sorry.\"\n\n\nJoseph reaches out to grab his revolver, before you grab his arm, stopping him.\n\n\n\"Aye. I agree. And I agree that it\u0027s also better safe than sorry should we be stopped and searched, as they\u0027re doing to every man, it seems. They find these on us, they\u0027ll shoot us and toss us in the River Lee.\"\n\n\n\"And if we don\u0027t have them, they might shoot us for being Irish and we\u0027ll be left with no way to stop them,\" Joseph says. \n",

Not a single British soldier or police officer is killed, while five IRA are killed. However, a shocking 80 men are captured when they run out of ammo, and are unable to continue fighting.

However with all you\u0027ve lost, who knows how you\u0027ll be able to continue.\n\n\nThanks to that loss, you have no idea how you\u0027re going to survive thanks to that.

  "page 469": "The war does not continue. Shortly after, negotiations begin between the Republican Government and the British government. President of Dáil Eireann, Eamon DeValera, visits London four times, before finally a delegation is sent over for negotiations.\n\n\nNegotiating for Britain was Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Lord Chancelor Lord Birkenhead, Leader of the House of Commons Austen Chamberlain, Secrety of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Attorney General Sir Gordon Hewart and Chief Secretary for Ireland Sir Hamar Greenwood.\n\n\nOn the Irish side, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and famed nationalist politician Arthur Griffith is chairman, accompanied by Secretary of Finance and military general Michael Collins, Secretary for Economic Affairs Robert Barton, and two Members of British Parliament and members of Dáil Eireann, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy.\n\n\nStrangely, President of Dáil Eamon DeValera chooses not to attend. Although reasons were not given, there\u0027s rumors that he knew whatever deal the Irish delegation could manage to argue for would certainly be far less than wanted, and he wanted someone to pin the blame on. \n\n\nThe negotiations are long and hard. The Anglo-Irish Treaty is devised, but it involves both sides sacrificing quite a bit. The Irish delegation refuses to sign it without consulting DeValera and the Dáil. Eventually, under threat of taking the two countries to war again, a final ultimatum is made: sign the treaty, or continue the war. With little choice, the delegation takes the former option. \n\n\nThe Treaty was a long, complicated document, but the main things were these: Crown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland. Ireland was to become a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, similar to Australia, Canada or South Africa. The British King would be the Head of State of the new state, known as the Irish Free State, or Saorstát Éireann. The new free state\u0027s parliament would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State. The more Protestant, Unionist Northern Ireland would would withdraw from the Free State, becoming it\u0027s own dominion of Britain with it\u0027s own parliament. Britain would control a number of Treaty Ports in Ireland. Ireland would draft it\u0027s own constitution giving it power of itself, but Britain would decide it\u0027s policies in terms of foreign affairs and war.\n\n\nThe treaty was met with a mixed bag. In many ways, it was far more than anyone had dreamed of before 1916. On the other hand, the idea of a free, independent Irish Republic was what many men had fought for, and was what many men had died for. Many saw it as a betrayal of principle to bow down to the crown after what they\u0027d done. \n\n\nThere\u0027s along debate in the Dáil, with Eamon DeValera leading the anti-Treaty side. The threat of war was used as evidence that the treaty was signed under duress and did not stand. In the end, the final vote was 64 to 57 in favor of the treaty. DeValera resigned as president in protest, to be replaced by Arthur Griffith. Many anti-treaty TDs left the Dáil, refusing to swear the Oath of Allegiance that would be necessary to stay in the Dáil. It became clear that there were serious divisions in the community. These divisions run through your community.\n\n\nYou stand in Fionn\u0027s farmhouse, discussing plans with him. The debate has been long and hard on what your unit has done. The IRA is to be disbanded, to be replaced by the National Army of the Irish Free State. As soldiers in the IRA, you\u0027re all offered positions in the army. However, many anti-treaty IRA officers have refused this offer, staying in the \"new\" IRA that refuses to acknowledge the treaty or the Dáil, for betraying the Irish republic they swore loyalty to. The path forward is being debated.\n\n\n\"This is more than we could ever get,\" Fionn says. \"If we oppose this, we\u0027ll be crushed. We don\u0027t have the arms or numbers to continue fighting.\"\n\n\n\"We didn\u0027t in the rising either!\" Joseph says. \"But we fought on, and good men gave their lives for the republic! Not this pathetic offering!\"\n\n\n\"The Dáil we pledged ourselves to voted in favor of this,\" Fionn says. \"We have a duty to serve.\"\n\n\n\"Damn right we do!\" Sean says. \"We swore a duty to the republic! We\u0027ll stand by it!\"\n\n\n\"Michael Collins\u0027 defended his view at the Dáil,\" Liam says. \"I was there. We\u0027re not abandoning the republic. He said this is only a stepping stone, but the path forward is through politics. We can\u0027t fight anymore but with our votes!\"\n\n\n\"Our votes?!\" Sean says. \"Did that get us anywhere in the past?!\"\n\n\n\"The new IRA has called for all true sons and daughters of the republic to serve them. I stand with them!\" Joseph says. \n\n\n\"That\u0027s a massacre. We\u0027ll be massacred if we go to war. We couldn\u0027t fight on,\" Fionn defends.\n\n\n\"We could\u0027ve fought on! We can fight on! I refuse to bow to the tyranny of the British crown, until the flag of the Republic of Ireland flies over the Dáil!

  "page 473": "The war does not continue. Shortly after, negotiations begin between the Republican Government and the British government. President of Dáil Eireann, Eamon DeValera, visits London four times, before finally a delegation is sent over for negotiations.\n\n\nNegotiating for Britain was Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Lord Chancelor Lord Birkenhead, Leader of the House of Commons Austen Chamberlain, Secrety of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Attorney General Sir Gordon Hewart and Chief Secretary for Ireland Sir Hamar Greenwood.\n\n\nOn the Irish side, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and famed nationalist politician Arthur Griffith is chairman, accompanied by Secretary of Finance and military general Michael Collins, Secretary for Economic Affairs Robert Barton, and two Members of British Parliament and members of Dáil Eireann, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy.\n\n\nStrangely, President of Dáil Eamon DeValera chooses not to attend. Although reasons were not given, there\u0027s rumors that he knew whatever deal the Irish delegation could manage to argue for would certainly be far less than wanted, and he wanted someone to pin the blame on. \n\n\nThe negotiations are long and hard. The Anglo-Irish Treaty is devised, but it involves both sides sacrificing quite a bit. The Irish delegation refuses to sign it without consulting DeValera and the Dáil. Eventually, under threat of taking the two countries to war again, a final ultimatum is made: sign the treaty, or continue the war. With little choice, the delegation takes the former option. \n\n\nThe Treaty was a long, complicated document, but the main things were these: Crown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland. Ireland was to become a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, similar to Australia, Canada or South Africa. The British King would be the Head of State of the new state, known as the Irish Free State, or Saorstát Éireann. The new free state\u0027s parliament would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State. The more Protestant, Unionist Northern Ireland would would withdraw from the Free State, becoming it\u0027s own dominion of Britain with it\u0027s own parliament. Britain would control a number of Treaty Ports in Ireland. Ireland would draft it\u0027s own constitution giving it power of itself, but Britain would decide it\u0027s policies in terms of foreign affairs and war.\n\n\nThe treaty was met with a mixed bag. In many ways, it was far more than anyone had dreamed of before 1916. On the other hand, the idea of a free, independent Irish Republic was what many men had fought for, and was what many men had died for. Many saw it as a betrayal of principle to bow down to the crown after what they\u0027d done. \n\n\nThere\u0027s along debate in the Dáil, with Eamon DeValera leading the anti-Treaty side. The threat of war was used as evidence that the treaty was signed under duress and did not stand. In the end, the final vote was 64 to 57 in favor of the treaty. DeValera resigned as president in protest, to be replaced by Arthur Griffith. Many anti-treaty TDs left the Dáil, refusing to swear the Oath of Allegiance that would be necessary to stay in the Dáil. It became clear that there were serious divisions in the community. These divisions run through your community.\n\n\nYou stand in Fionn\u0027s farmhouse, discussing plans with him. The debate has been long and hard on what your unit has done. The IRA is to be disbanded, to be replaced by the National Army of the Irish Free State. As soldiers in the IRA, you\u0027re all offered positions in the army. However, many anti-treaty IRA officers have refused this offer, staying in the \"new\" IRA that refuses to acknowledge the treaty or the Dáil, for betraying the Irish republic they swore loyalty to. The path forward is being debated.\n\n\n\"This is more than we could ever get,\" Fionn says. \"If we oppose this, we\u0027ll be crushed. We don\u0027t have the arms or numbers to continue fighting.\"\n\n\n\"We didn\u0027t in the rising either!\" Joseph says. \"But we fought on, and good men gave their lives for the republic! Not this pathetic offering!\"\n\n\n\"The Dáil we pledged ourselves to voted in favor of this,\" Fionn says. \"We have a duty to serve.\"\n\n\n\"Damn right we do!\" Sean says. \"We swore a duty to the republic! We\u0027ll stand by it!\"\n\n\n\"Michael Collins\u0027 defended his view at the Dáil,\" Liam says. \"I was there. We\u0027re not abandoning the republic. He said this is only a stepping stone, but the path forward is through politics. We can\u0027t fight anymore but with our votes!\"\n\n\n\"Our votes?!\" Sean says. \"Did that get us anywhere in the past?!\"\n\n\n\"The new IRA has called for all true sons and daughters of the republic to serve them. I stand with them!\" Joseph says. \n\n\n\"That\u0027s a massacre. We\u0027ll be massacred if we go to war. We couldn\u0027t fight on,\" Fionn defends.\n\n\n\"We could\u0027ve fought on! We can fight on! I refuse to bow to the tyranny of the British crown, until the flag of the Republic of Ireland flies over the Dáil! Enough men died for us to fight on to see it happen!\" Joseph shouts.  \n\n\n\"Michael!\" Fionn says, looking to you. \"You\u0027ve stayed silent. Care to make your opinions known?\"\n",

You can hear the screams and cries in the distance, as well as gunshots. You quickly hurry down the streets towards them, as the air gets hot and fills with ash. Soon, you\u0027re confronted by a row of buildings, all either going up in flames or fully ablaze. You watch as people desperately try to escape the buildings, hurrying to escape as smoke fills their lungs and burns lick their flesh.\n\n\nMeanwhile, standing right next to them, seemingly uncaring to their pains and struggles, are a group of Black and Tans. Some wear their uniform, others don\u0027t, but they have balaclavas pulled up their face, covering their mouths to obscure their face and stop them from breathing in smoke. They laugh, splashing petrol into the burning buildings, helping the fire spread, although due to the old wooden frameworks of the buildings, they\u0027re already burning at an incredibly rate.  \n\n\nYou look around, wondering how to deal with this. You could confront the bastards doing this, or just keep a low profile and try help the people. \n",

  "page 593": "The struggle for Irish independence was a long and brutal one. Many men lost their lives on both sides. Irish citizens suffered under British oppression for hundreds of years, as Catholics were discriminated against and treated as second class citizens. Poverty was rampant under British rule, as the rich took advantage of the poor. Food was actually shipped out of Ireland during the Great Famine, where a million lives were snuffed out, and a million more souls being forced to emigrate. To this day, the Irish population hasn\u0027t recovered to its pre-Famine numbers.\n\n\nThe troubles in Northern Ireland would eventually lessen as religious divides were cast aside. To this day, these tensions still exist, however. Still, the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, has improved greatly, to the point where they\u0027re tied to the hip economically and culturally.\n\n\nIn the end, there was a struggle between ideas, with heroes on both sides. In the Easter Rising, there were simple soldiers and policemen trying to keep order at home while there comrades fought the Germans across the seas, and Irish patriots desperate to free and liberate their country. In the War of Independence, although there were certainly many abusive and oppressive figures on the side of Britain, there were also many soldiers just performing their duty to keep order and PTSD-stricken veterans who were making a living the only way they could, with people trying to free their country and end a long, painful oppression. In the Treaty War, there were those who wanted peace, who were willing to go with pragmatism and take what they could, versus those who felt betrayed by their country and wanted to free their independence, a goal so many of their friends had been given for. Even in later years, with the Troubles in Northern Ireland, there was just those trying to protect their newfound country and their cultural identity, versus men who still considered themselves as soldiers in the war of independence, forgotten by the greater nation as they tried to end British rule and the oppression of Catholics.\n\n\nIn the end, there were victors and victims, but thankfully, the bloodshed could come to an end, and independence could be achieved peacefully.\n\n\nHopefully, you\u0027ve enjoyed the story of a nation at war with itself, of brothers fighting brothers, of conflict, loss and passion. If nothing else, I hope you\u0027ve learnt something about my home nation and its struggle for independence.\n\n\nGo raibh maith agat as léamh, agus tá lá iontach agat.\n",

However, it\u0027s barely ten minutes before people start running out of ammo, and your forces begin getting far more desperate in trying to push off the enemy. It\u0027s clear that the defense isn\u0027t going to last much longer.\n\n\n\"Fuck! They\u0027re going to overwhelm us soon!\" Joseph says. \"We don\u0027t have rifles, we\u0027re low on ammo, and we\u0027re not going to last long. What do we do?\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t know! The mission\u0027s complete, maybe it\u0027s time to retreat,\" you say.\n",
  "page 697": "Over the next few months, the treaty war gets more and more out of hand, spiraling out of control. It\u0027s not long before it becomes clear that the IRA are losing, and the Free State are soon going to triumph.\n\n\nHowever, like every war, there are casualties. Arthur Griffith, overworked and strained from constant stress in keeping the government running smoothly while keeping Britain appeased, dies from heart failure leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Only ten days later, at Béal na Bláth, Michael Collins is assassinated in an IRA ambush, where he is the only loss.\n\n\nAfter losing two great leaders, the Free State becomes far more draconian in it\u0027s work in ending this whole blasted war., including performing executions without trials, larger scale internment and the criminalization of holding any arms whatsoever. This leads to the execution of Erskine Childers, the man who first ran guns for the Irish Volunteers, after he was found with a pistol that he claimed was a gift form Michael Collins. His last words become famous. As he stared down the firing squad to execute him, he said \"Take a step forward, lads. It\u0027ll be easier that way.\" If nothing else, the man went out with style. As the war gets more brutal, it becomes clear Ireland as a nation will not last unless this comes to an end soon.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it seems you have a new assignment. Rory O\u0027Connor, your old ally in the IRA, who was captured in the taking of the Four Courts, has been sentenced to death. You\u0027re part of the firing squad that\u0027s being used to execute the poor man later in the day.\n\n\nAs you walk down the streets of Dublin in your uniform, you wonder if you should stop by Rory\u0027s cell, to see him one last time before the end. Or perhaps you should just head to the nearest bar and get a drink, see if you can\u0027t drink away the pains of killing an old friend.\n",
  "page 212": "\"Put your fucking hands up high!\" you scream. \"I swear to God, I will shoot you!\"\n\n\nThe RIC reaching for the gun pauses, raising his hands again. You keep him in your sights, as Sean begins slowly moving down the rocky terrain, several lengths of rope tied around his waist and a pistol in his hands. \n\n\n\"Now, my good friend Brian Boru is going to tie all you up. Isn\u0027t that right, Mr Boru?\" Ernie O\u0027Malley says. \n\n\n\"Damn fucking straight,\" Sean replies. \"Whilst I have you, Constables, been looking for my crown ever since Clontarf. You seen it?\"\n\n\nSean reaches the constables, and grabs the first\u0027s wrists, binding them together. He moves to the next, binding him, before going onto the third. The third grabs Sean\u0027s wrists, pushing him back for a second. Sean raises the pistol, pressing the barrel against the RIC\u0027s chin.\n\n\n\"I swear to fuck, am I not making myself clear? If you were going to make a fucking move, best have done it already, when you had four fighting men with you instead of two,\" Ernie says. \n\n\nThe man pauses, releasing his grip on Sean\u0027s wrist. Sean tries his hands up, making sure there\u0027s a loop of rope around his head to keep it forced down. He moves to the last RIC, who again lets Sean tie them. The prisoners are forced to their knees, as Ernie steps out into the open, strolling over to the carriage. You follow him to the back, where he climbs inside, pulling open the door to let you all see inside. Boxes of ammo and rifles sit inside, as Ernie busts the first one open to reveal a bolt-action rifle. \n\n\n\"Perfect,\" Ernie says. \"Now, let\u0027s get out of here, men. We follow the plan.\"\n\n\n\"What about the captives?\" Sean asks.\n\n\nErnie walks over to the captives, looking them over.\n\n\n\"You are the luckiest men I have ever seen,\" Ernie chuckles. \"If you had been captured by any other men of the IRA, you might\u0027ve been executed. Or at least had your hands broken so you couldn\u0027t fight. I\u0027m just going to give you some information. If you\u0027re ever captured by me again, you\u0027re going to be tortured and shot. Retire from the Royal Irish Constabulary, men. Learn your lessons. Now, stand up and get walking, or I\u0027ll here shoot you dead.\"\n\n\nThe prisoners stand, and quickly begin hurrying away. Ernie watches them run, nodding.\n\n\n\"Glad we didn\u0027t have to kill them. There\u0027s a lot of great men who don\u0027t deserve to die on either side of this war. Now, let\u0027s bring those horses out from where we left them and load up the rifles so we can get out of here,\" Ernie says.\n",
  "page 333": "You raise your pistol, opening fire as the other lorry successfully pulls up. Immediately, over a dozen Auxiliaries begin piling out of that lorry, joined by the least wounded from the other lorry. They quickly fall into formation, their more powerful rifles raising as they open fire at you. \n\n\nQuickly, their high numbers and better weapons quickly overwhelms you. Their gunfire strikes down one of the men next to you. Another bullet slams into your chest, punching you backwards as you collapse to the ground. You lie on the ground, blood pouring down your chest as it fills your lungs. You cough and splutter as you writhe on the ground. It doesn\u0027t take long before the rest of your squad is dying alongside you, outnumbered and outgunned.\n",
  "page 454": "\"Arson, I suppose,\" you say.\n\n\nYou and Joseph quickly grab a pair of cans of petrol, and head back to Wing B, a good as place to start as any. You begin dousing the files you\u0027re trying to destroy with petrol, soaking everything in it so that you can make sure all the evidence of this British regime and all their knowledge garnered through the oppression of the Irish people is lost. Finally, when all that is said and done, you strike a match, watching with a smile as the light yellow flame warms your heart and very soul. \n\n\n\"Beautiful,\" you say. \"Let\u0027s get back to the main hall.\"\n\n\n.At this point, fire\u0027s spread through much of the building, as it gives off a big great plume of smoke. Still, it\u0027s easy enough to navigate. As you try to head back to your allies in the main hall, an IRA soldier slams into you. The boy\u0027s been rushing the halls blindly, and looks confused.\n\n\nA man rushes through the hallways of the burning building, slamming into you.\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s your gun, boy? What are you doing?\" you ask, pushing the man off you.\n\n\n\"We were overrun! We\u0027re out of ammo, we need to get out of here while we still can! They\u0027re capturing everyone else!\" he says frantically. \n\n\n\"What? We can\u0027t have been fighting more than half an hour!\" you say.\n\n\nThe man shrugs, before pushing past you and rushing off. You quickly begin planning your escape. The plan involved an escape route, guarded by IRA soldiers from which to evacuate after the fires were set. On the other hand, you could escape out the back, where the smoke is being blown, which might provide you with some cover to escape this place.\n",
  "page 575": "\"I\u0027m going too,\" you say. \"I\u0027m not going to surrender.\"\n\n\n\"No, boy, you should surrender. You don\u0027t need to die with me. Surrender. That\u0027s an order.\"\n\n\n\"Well then, I\u0027ll happily mutiny against your unjust orders. I\u0027ve committed treason against Britain and the Free State, I\u0027ll happily do so again for the cause.\"\n\n\n\"I suppose so. Let\u0027s go out like gentlemen, then. It\u0027s been an honor, men. Let\u0027s finish this,\" he says.\n\n\nHe takes a deep breath, letting out a silent prayer, before he moves out of cover and bursts out of the house, raising his revolver.\n\n\nYou raise your rifle, charging out of the room as you rush into the street, raising your rifle and firing. Cathal Brugha is struck in the thigh, spiraling into the street with a pained scream. You raise your rifle, firing back at the Free State soldiers. You don\u0027t really aim; you\u0027re tired of the bloodshed. Instead, you attack to make sure they have to. There\u0027s a burst of rifle fire, as a bullet slams into your chest, knocking the wind from your lungs. \n\n\nYou collapse back to the street, as a warmth overtakes you. Slowly, your pained gasps begin to still, as a great calm overtakes you. You relax, as your blood seeps out into the streets of Dublin.\n",

I guess I\u0027ll be on my way, then.\"\n\n\nJoseph tersely tips his cap to you in an almost mocking manner, before he turns and begins strolling down the road away from the farm.

There\u0027s a long pause, as you just manage to avoid swearing or cussing him out. You wait, choosing your words carefully.\n\n\n\"You have a lot of explaining to do, Joseph.\"\n\n\n\"Explaining?\" Joseph asks with a smile. \"I\u0027m fighting for an Irish republic and full independence. That\u0027s what we both fought for with the IRA, isn\u0027t it? I never left the IRA, and I never stopped fighting. Maybe you need to explain yourself.\"\n\n\n\"I did what was necessary! We got the best we were ever going to get, and you want to throw it away, to gun down your former friends, comrades and family, all for nothing!\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m doing what I can to see the Irish flag fly free!\"\n\n\n\"You might as well piss on the fucking flag, Joseph.\n\n\n\"I wasn\u0027t the one firing artillery down on our heads in the Four Courts!\" Joseph says, growing angrier. \n\n\n\"You were the one who took the Four Courts in the first place! That\u0027s an act of war!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Michael, Joseph, stop fighting, for god\u0027s sake!\" Mary begs.\n\n\n\"Stay out of this, Mary.

I\u0027m not trying to belittle you, I\u0027m trying to keep you safe.\"\n\n\n\"Joseph, you need to come home and stop fighting! Killing Irishmen is not the way forward! We will get a full republic, but through the political process!\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s right, Joseph,\" Arthur adds. \"The pen will be what wins the country independence, not the gun!\"\n\n\n\"How the fuck are you going to give out to me for fighting Michael\u0027s British allies!? You, of all fucking people!?\" Joseph snaps. \"That baby sitting right here with us isn\u0027t even your fucking kid, he\u0027s the son of a fucking British soldier who raped your wife while serving the crown that Joseph serves!\"\n\n\nYou\u0027re so taken aback you can\u0027t even find the anger within you. Mary bursts into tears, pressing her face into your chest as Arthur rises. You turn to look at him, who sits there, his eyes narrowing. Arthur doesn\u0027t snap, or go red, but he\u0027s instead taken by something far more terrifying. Arthur stands, his lanky frame no filling the room with his presence, as his voice drops to a quiet, cold snarl.\n\n\n\"You ever say a fucking about my son, I will put a fucking bullet through your skull,\" Arthur says, stepping up close to Joseph as Joseph\n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t mean...\" Joseph says meekly, as Arthur sneers at him.\n\n\n\"Get the fuck out of here, Joseph. Nothing good\u0027s going to come from you staying,\" he says darkly. \n\n\nJoseph goes to protest, before nodding weakly. You watch as he makes his way out of the house. You let out a quiet sigh of relief that he\u0027s left, before turning to Arthur, whose darkened face is staring at Joseph walks down the driveway. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Arthur,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m alright. Nothing to be sorry for,\" Arthur says, leaning in to give Morgan a quick peck on the cheek. \"He\u0027s wrong. Morgan\u0027s my boy. Nothing else matters.\"\n\n\nArthur nods wordlessly, as you go to the cabinet.\n\n\nLittle else is said in the night, as you drink away your sorrows. When Ma gets back, not a word is said to her. It\u0027s best not to upset her with these things. Instead, you all just head to bed, not wanting to talk about the day\u0027s events.\n",

You hurry out to where smoke floods through the room, bursting out into the smoke as you rush out, staying low as you cough and splutter, smoke entering your lungs. Your eyes begin to water as you struggle to breath. You quickly move through the the smoke as it grants you cover, letting you escape out into  the surrounding city.\n\n\nThis gives you the opportunity to quickly escape down off towards the other buildings around you, retreating to the alley of a building. You rush through it, looking briefly back at the burning Common House behind you, as it\u0027s set up in flames.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Joseph says, grabbing your shoulder.\n\n\nYou nod with determination, before heading off to get the hell out of there.\n",

At least, no one else.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s not entirely true,\" Cathal Brugha chuckles grimly. \"I\u0027m armed with a revolver, and I will not surrender to a puppet of the state we once fought against.

Two Auxiliaries stand over a kneeling man, who is completely naked, his clothes sitting besides him. They press the rifle against his head, as a red-faced man barks and screams at him, as he forces the naked man to sing \"God save the Queen\", the English national anthem.\n\n\n\"Long to reign over us! God save the Queen!\" the man is forced to sing. \n\n\nIt\u0027s clear he\u0027s been singing for quite some time at the top of his lungs. He\u0027s exhausted, with sweat dripping down his brown as he freezes in the cold. \n\n\n\"They\u0027re not even IRA. Those bastards just rounded up civilians to do this. It\u0027s humiliating.\"\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here, we don\u0027t want to risk getting caught.\"\n\n\n\"Michael, we have to help them! We can\u0027t leave them,\" Joseph says.\n",
  "page 458": "\"Let\u0027s go!\" you say to Joseph. \"Out through the smoke, it\u0027ll let us escape.\"\n\n\nJoseph nods, and the two of you rush towards the back of the building, rushing through the hallways as there\u0027s a frantic attempt to retreat. You hurry out to where smoke floods through the room, bursting out into the smoke as you rush out, staying low as you cough and splutter, smoke entering your lungs. Your eyes begin to water as you struggle to breath. You quickly move through the the smoke as it grants you cover, letting you escape out into  the surrounding city.\n\n\nThis gives you the opportunity to quickly escape down off towards the other buildings around you, retreating to the alley of a building. You rush through it, looking briefly back at the burning Common House behind you, as it\u0027s set up in flames.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Joseph says, grabbing your shoulder.\n\n\nYou nod with determination, before heading off to get the hell out of there.\n",
  "page 579": "You rush down to the grenade sitting on the floor of the Mutineer, frantically grabbing for it. Unfortunately, it\u0027s slipped between a pair of seats.\n\n\n\"Fuck, get the grenade, get the grenade!\" you scream, desperately rushing down to grab the grenade.\n\n\nYou reach down, your fingers slipping around the grenade. Your sweaty fingers take a moment to grab hold, but you do, pulling it up with a mighty tug. However, just as you raise it into the air to fling it out, it goes off, showering you with shrapnel as the burning hot metal slices you apart and killing you instantly.\n",
  "page 219": "You don\u0027t step forward, like the rest of the men there. You all just watch, sickened by the scene in front of you. After a moment, Ernie smiles, nodding.\n\n\n\"There we are. We spare him. It\u0027s easy to sentence a man to death, but so much harder to pull the trigger,\" he says again. \"Sean, use the rope to tie him up.\"\n\n\nSean tries his hands up, making sure there\u0027s a loop of rope around his head to keep it forced down. The prisoner is forced to his knees, as Ernie steps off, strolling over to the carriage. You follow him to the back, where he climbs inside, pulling open the door to let you all see inside. Boxes of ammo and rifles sit inside, as Ernie busts the first one open to reveal a bolt-action rifle. \n\n\n\"Perfect,\" Ernie says. \"Now, let\u0027s get out of here, men. We follow the plan.\"\n\n\n\"What about the captive?\" Sean asks.\n\n\nErnie walks over to the captive, looking down at him\n\n\n\"You are the luckiest man I have ever seen,\" Ernie chuckles. \"If you had been captured by any other men of the IRA, you might\u0027ve been executed. Or at least had your hands broken so you couldn\u0027t fight. I\u0027m just going to give you some information. If you\u0027re ever captured by me again, you\u0027re going to be tortured and shot. Retire from the Royal Irish Constabulary, Cobh man. Learn your lessons. Now, stand up and get walking, or I\u0027ll here shoot you dead.\"\n\n\nThe prisoner stands, and quickly begins hurrying away. Ernie watches him run, nodding.\n\n\n\"Glad we didn\u0027t have to kill them all. There\u0027s a lot of great men who don\u0027t deserve to die on either side of this war. He might\u0027ve been one of them. Now, let\u0027s bring those horses out from where we left them and load up the rifles so we can get out of here,\" Ernie says.\n",
  "page 218": "You step forward, raising your rifle as you point at the man\u0027s head. You take a deep breath, focusing the gun barrel and staring down the iron sights.\n\n\n\"Are you willing to do it?\" Ernie O\u0027Malley says, intrigued.\n\n\nYou pull the trigger, and the man\u0027s head explodes in a burst of pink, grey skull matter and chunks of skull bursting out in front of you. \n\n\n\"Jesus,\" Ernie says, stepping back. \"You called my bluff. Fuck\u0027s sake, you\u0027re a cold son of a bitch.\"\n\n\nYou nod, feeling a strange rush of emotions as you look at the dead man by your feet. Joseph looks at you, a worried look on his face.\n\n\n\"Jesus, Joseph,\" he says nervously. \"How... how the fuck could you do that?\"\n\n\n\"I did what needed to be done,\" you say. \"We can\u0027t have mercy in this war.\"\n\n\n\"Damn right,\" Sean says. \"You\u0027re a better man than I.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose,\" Fionn says. \n\n\n\"You\u0027ve changed so quickly, Michael,\" Joseph says. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll forget this.\"\n\n\n\"Forget it, we need to act. Let\u0027s check on the guns,\" Ernie says. \n\n\nErnie steps away from the scene of the execution, strolling over to the carriage. You follow him to the back, where he climbs inside, pulling open the door to let you all see inside. Boxes of ammo and rifles sit inside, as Ernie busts the first one open to reveal a bolt-action rifle.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s bring those horses out from where we left them and load up the rifles so we can get out of here,\" Ernie says. \"Now, let\u0027s get out of here, men. We follow the plan.\"\n",
  "page 460": "\"Let\u0027s go!\" you say to Joseph.\n\n\nThe two of you quickly let out a burst of fire, before you burst out from the columns, sprinting along them. You rush out towards the flank, where there\u0027s few Auxiliaries. You rush along the ground, hurrying along with Joseph and a few other men. The Auxiliaries, thinking you\u0027re charging them, seem to retreat temporarily, panicked as they misunderstand the situation, giving you a path to escape to the surrounding buildings of the city. This gives you the opportunity to quickly escape down off towards the other buildings around you, retreating to the alley of a building. You rush through it, looking briefly back at the burning Common House behind you, as it\u0027s set up in flames.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Joseph says, grabbing your shoulder.\n\n\nYou nod with determination, before heading off to hide and get home.\n",
  "page 581": "Seeing no other option, you lower your gun slowly, before dropping it to the ground. \n\n\n\"We surrender!\" you call out to the Free State soldiers.\n\n\n\"Come out with your hands up then! Any funny business and we open fire!\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re all Irish here? Do you think we\u0027re the type to try a false surrender?\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027d do anymore. I never thought my fellow Irishmen, especially those of the IRA, would betray the cause.\"\n\n\n\"We...!\" you begin to say angrily, before realizing there\u0027s no use.  \"We\u0027re coming out\"\n\n\nYou move out into the open, staring right down the barrel of a rifle, as you\u0027re quickly surrounded by a group of Free State soldiers. You raise your hands, as they grab your arms, pulling them behind your back as you\u0027re forced to your knees.\n\n\n\"Evening, gentlemen,\" you say with a weak, bitter smile as you\u0027re quickly dragged away, where you\u0027re blindfolded and forced to whatever fate awaits you.\n",
  "page 580": "With a scream, you frantically hurry to clamber out of the armored car, just managing to roll off the roof of the car as the Mutineer is destroyed behind you. You hit the mud with a soft thump, as you frantically rise up to your feet.\n\n\n\"Hands in the air!\" a voice cries from besides you. \n\n\nYou look up at the Irish Free State soldiers who are now swarmed around you, staring down as they shift their rifles to aim at you. Unfortunately, you\u0027ve found yourself armed with only a pistol, surrounded by the very men who just swarmed the Mutineer. As your pistol feels heavy in your holster, you quickly decide what to do.\n",

  "page 340": "You nod, feeling rage boil up through you.\n\n\n\"We can\u0027t let this man die because of our actions!\" you\u0027re right.\n\n\nJoseph draws his pistol, nodding at you.\n\n\n\"We rush them, then get the wounded man out of there before he\u0027s executed. Then, we draw them off, letting the other men escape.\"\n\n\n\"On three,\" you whisper. \"One, two...\"\n\n\nYou quickly rush forward, opening fire with your revolver. One of the Auxiliaries\u0027 heads explodes as he collapses backwards with a burst of blood. The second one goes to raise, his rifle, before Joseph fires, shooting him in the chest and killing him instantly.\n\n\n\"Hey! You fucking traitors to the Crown! IRA!\" one of the soldiers screams.\n\n\nQuickly, half a dozen riflemen rush out of the bar, as you reach down, grabbing the man\u0027s arm.\n\n\n\"Joseph, help me! We need to get him out of here!\" you yell.\n\n\nJoseph leans down, grabbing the brutalized man as you yank him to your feet. You manage to get him to your feet, before the rifles went off. You feel like you\u0027re punched in the chest, as you\u0027re knocked to the ground, bringing down the injured man and Joseph with you. You collapse to the ground, as pain begins to shoot through your body as you let out a desperate gasp for help. Another volley of shots goes off, and your pain ends.\n",
  "page 461": "You raise your pistol, opening fire at the advancing Auxiliaries. Their rifle fire, bursting out in an exchange of bullets, as you stay in cover, firing back at the advancing Auxiliaries in an attempt to hold them back. You manage to stop them from rushing up to push into the Customs House, although this situation clearly won\u0027t last as you\u0027re low on ammo.\n\n\nIt\u0027s not long before the IRA soldiers around you begin running out of ammo. There\u0027s been little more than half an hour of gunfire, and you\u0027re not able to keep fighting. You crouch behind a pillar outside the Common House, staring at Joseph.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m nearly out,\" you tell him.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m gone,\" Joseph says. \"We need to make a runner. If we surrender, we\u0027ll be executed.\"\n\n\n\"On three?\" you ask, as Joseph nods, determined.\n\n\n\"One, two...!\"\n\n\nYou burst out from cover, sprinting along the columns as you hurry to escape the fire.

Suddenly, a bullet slams into your side, knocking you to the ground with a pained yell.\n\n\n\"Get the fuck...!\" Joseph screams, grabbing you. \n\n\nJoseph\u0027s head snaps back as he\u0027s hit in the head. You let out a pained, traumatized scream, grabbing Joseph as he collapses to the ground. You wrap your arms around him, your blow flowing into his, as you hug him tightly. Then, rifle fire ends your suffering.\n",
  "page 582": "You raise your pistol, opening fire at the men around you. You fire a burst of lead into the chest of the nearest soldier, knocking him off his feet as he collapses into the gutter. You twist around, continuing to fire, before a burst of bullets is shot straight through your chest as your lungs are blown to ribbons. You try to let out a desperate scream, but instead it\u0027s a weak, wet squelch as you find yourself incapable of making any sound besides the wet dribbling of your blood as it runs down your chest.\n\n\nAs your life is blown from your chest, you\u0027re left stumbling backwards as you gently bump into the armored car, before sliding down it with a wet, red smear, your vision going dark and blurry. With that, your head rolls to the side. \n"
