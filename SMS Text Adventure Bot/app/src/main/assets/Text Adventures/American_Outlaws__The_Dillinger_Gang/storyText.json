Hands up!\" you shout. \"Everybody on the floor!\"\n\nHomer strides towards the counter, one of the teller runs from the counter into an office and tries to slams the door.

We\u0027re looking at a bank job in Grand Haven, Michigan later this month if you are interested.\"\n\n\"Thanks Homer but Harry and I have some scores of our own lined up,\" John tells him. \"I\u0027ve got a mind to try and get some guns smuggled into Michigan State Pen to help Pete, Charles, Red and Russell bust out.

Eddie Green is a red-haired veteran stick-up man, Tommy Carroll is a handsome ex-boxer while the two recruits Earl Doyle and Chuck Fisher are typical grim-faced gangsters. Eddie Bentz is blond-haired and capable, he has a long history of pulling off some of the most successful bank robberies of the last ten years.\n\nOne summer\u0027s day you, Eddie Bentz and Jimmy walk into the bank while Homer and Earl guard the doors, Eddie Green and Tommy wait on the streets and Chuck sits in the escape car. The three of you walk up to the counter and draw your pistols while Jimmy whips a machine gun out from under his coat.\n\n\"Hands up,\" he barks.\n\nEddie Green and Tommy hurry inside as planned and help you take the customers and bank staff hostage while Eddie and Jimmy begin emptying the contents of the vault into sacks.\n\nOutside you hear Homer shout \"Hurry, the alarm\u0027s been raised!\"\n\n\"Don\u0027t shoot unless they start shooting first,\" Eddie B cautions Jimmy.\n\nWith the sack of money in hand you all run out on the street as a man with a shotgun fires at you from the other side of the road, blasting a hole in a bank window - Jimmy returns fire wit his machine gun making the man dive for cover as the bullets blast through car windows and glass store fronts. The others run out onto the street as well.\n\nAt that point you notice something.\n\n\"Our car, where is it?\" you demand.\n\n\"Chuck panicked and drove off,\" Homer yells back to you.\n\nFor a moment you are all stunned and then Eddie B runs into the road and waving his pistol he forces an approaching car to stop. As the woman inside scrambles out Eddie stands by the open door and yells for you all to get in. Most of your fellow gang members start running towards him.\n\n\"We all won\u0027t fit in that little car,\" Earl shouts back. \"We should run for it.\"\n",

Much of Homer\u0027s stuff is still at his apartment but he doesn\u0027t dare go back for it in case the FBI is watching it, Eddie decides to pay a woman he knows to go to the apartment, collect up all the stuff and then drop by her apartment to pick it up. You are nervous about the idea but Eddie asks you to accompany him.\n",

Initially you and Harry are unsure what to do but days later ten prisoners use the guns John smuggled into them to escape Michigan State Penitentiary.\n\nYour friends Harry Pierpont, Charles Makley, Red Hamilton and Russell Clark use stolen cars to reach Indianapolis where you and Harry meet with them a few days later. You are thrilled to see your pals again: Harry, cold and clever, Charles, experienced and dependable, Red, absent-minded but loyal and Russell, gregarious and confident, are all thrilled to see you too. They are soon planning a bank robbery in the nearby town of St Mary\u0027s Ohio before busting John out of prison. Harry, who doesn\u0027t know any of them, turns down taking part in the robbery and instead opts to hide out in Chicago for a month or two.\n",

John makes contact with some guards who agree to smuggle several loaded pistols he purchased into the prison. Once that is accomplished you both head down to Dayton, Ohio so John can visit a girlfriend of his called Mary Longnaker.\n\nVisiting Mary\u0027s apartment you decide to go out on the balcony for a smoke while John shows Mary some photos he took recently. While you are on the balcony you hear a knock on the door. A moment later you hear it opened and two men walk into the room. A second later your blood runs cold as you hear them speak.\n\n\"Stick them up John, we\u0027re police officers,\" a voice orders. \"Don\u0027t resist John. I\u0027ll kill you.\"\n\nA dozen thoughts rush through your head, though you are on the fifteenth floor you wonder if you can climb down onto the balcony below...\n",

Your gun goes flying and you try to struggle but a pistol is shoved in your face quickly convincing you to stop. You are both taken into custody and within days found guilty of bank robbery.\n\nYou have only been out of prison for five months when you are sent back to Michigan State Penitentiary to serve your time - there you are reunited with your friends Pete Pierpont, Charles Makley, Red Hamilton and Russell Clark.\n\nFortunately John does not intend for you to stay in prison for long...\n",
  "page 9": "Two weeks after the Daleville Robbery the three of you drive into the little town of Montpelier, while Harry stays in the car you and John stroll into the bank, draw your pistols on the customers and tellers inside and announce this is a stick-up. Almost immediately a female teller reaches towards a button on the wall and John trains his gun on her.\n\n\"What are you trying to do, set off that alarm?\" he asks, chewing his gum.\n\n\"I would if I could,\" the woman snaps back.\n\nJohn herds the prisoners up against a wall while you stride into the vault and shove all the money you can find inside into a bag before locking the customers inside the vault. As you walk out of the bank you encounter an old man standing outside who has obviously been watching what has happened through the windows.\n\n\"Looks like the bank\u0027s being held up again,\" he comments to the pair of you.\n\n\"It\u0027s so easy, I\u0027m not surprised,\" you tell him with a smile. Climbing in the car you drive off with Harry and count the money in the back. You have stolen $10,000, making your share $3,300. Soon after the robbery you get word that your old prison friend Homer Van Meter wants to meet so the three of you drive up to Chicago, Illinois to see him.\n\nHomer, a skinny, cold character who in prison was something as a loner greets the three of you looking happier than you remember seeing him looking before.\n\n\"Hello pals,\" he says shaking hands with you all. \"I\u0027ve been reading about your bank jobs in Indiana and Ohio, they\u0027re great stuff. I\u0027ve teamed up with an outfit myself led by Baby Face Nelson. You know him right, used to lead a gang three years ago and escaped from prison last year? He\u0027s a real tough character.\"\n\n\"I heard he was gun-crazy and a killer,\" Harry says frowning.\n\n\"Well maybe a little but he\u0027s a guy you want on your side in a gun-battle,\" Homer says cheerfully. \"He\u0027s put together a nice little crew, there\u0027s me, a former boxer called Tommy Carroll, Eddie Green of the Barker-Karpis Gang, that old veteran masterthief Eddie Bentz and two Chicago gangsters called Earl Doyle and Chuck Fisher. We\u0027re looking at a bank job in Grand Haven, Michigan later this month if you are interested.\"\n\n\"Thanks Homer but Harry and I have some scores of our own lined up,\" John tells him. \"I\u0027ve got a mind to try and get some guns smuggled into Michigan State Pen to help Pete, Charles, Red and Russell bust out. If I can get them out we can start up our own gang.\"\n\n\"Well the offer is always there if you want it,\" Homer tells John before turning to you. \"What do you reckon? You want to join the Nelson Gang?\"\n",
  "page 14": "You join the others in running towards the car, there isn\u0027t enough room for everybody inside the compact car so while Eddie B drives and Jimmy, Tommy and Eddie G pile in you and Homer have to stand on the running boards as you drive out of town - looking back you see Earl Doyle tackled to the ground and captured by townsfolk. Once you are out of town you are able to hijack a second car out of town and drive on across the state.\n\nCounting the money you find you have stolen just $3,500, making your share $500. Eddie B is furious at the poorly executed robbery and derides all of you as a gang of amateurs. He plans to go to New York and essentially retire from crime. Jimmy is not much perturbed and is quickly putting together plans to rob another bank, this time in Minnesota.\n",
  "page 17": "You stick with the Nelson Gang and two months after the Grand Haven fiasco you drive into Brainerd, Minnesota. This time Jimmy leaves you in the car while he leads Homer, Tommy, Eddie and Chuck into the bank. You sit tight for ten minutes drumming your fingers impatiently on the dashboard until finally your companions emerge. There is no sign that the alarm has been raised.\n\nSuddenly Jimmy does an inexplicable thing. He raises his machine gun and fires a burst of bullets into a shop front across the street, making the people inside dive for cover. Striding towards the car he continues to fire at shop fronts and cars grinning before jumping in the car after the others and all of you drive out of town. You are not convinced Jimmy is completely mentally stable.\n\nThe Gang has escaped with $32,000, making your share $5,300. Jimmy decides that you should all split up: Chuck and Tommy will drive down to San Antonio, Texas and hide out while Jimmy, Eddie and Homer will go to St Paul, Minnesota. In the papers you read how John and Harry succeeded in busting your friends out of prison where they have formed a gang and started robbing banks but as you have no idea where they are or how to find them you\u0027ll have to hide out with one of the halves of the Nelson Gang for now.\n",
  "page 16": "You decide to go into hiding with Eddie Bentz, relying on the wily veteran to keep you both out of trouble. This he largely manages: while your fellow gang members are all robbing banks, getting arrested or shot you two live quietly in hotels in New York, rarely venturing outside. You read in papers of Harry Copeland\u0027s arrest, of the arrest of Chuck Fisher and the shooting deaths of Eddie Green and Tommy Carroll. Soon of your friends only John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter remain at large and the whole country is looking for them.\n\nFinally one day, more to relieve the boredom than anything else, you and Eddie drive up to Vermont where you sit in the car while Eddie goes into the bank. He emerges five minutes later with a sack of money and the two of you drive back down south. You have both stolen $8,500, making your share of the money $4,200.\n\nYou return to New York and continue to live quietly for the rest of the year: by the end of the year John, Homer and Baby Face have all been tracked down and killed by local lawmen or the FBI. You and Eddie are the only members of the Dillinger or Nelson Gangs still at large and now the FBI are focusing all their resources on finding you two... you begin to question whether it is safe to remain in New York.\n",

  "page 0": "Born in 1900 you were a prosperous lawyer in Ohio. You had a wife, a good job and a good salary.\n\nIn 1929 the banks went bust, money became worthless and the Great Depression destroyed America. Your life savings were lost and your world destroyed. Many banks closed, dollars weren\u0027t worth the ink to print them, lenders demanded their money back and your life changed forever. First you were sacked, your office closed and unable to find work you were forced to watch as your personal belongings were sold one by one. Your wife, pregnant with your first child, caught pneumonia which worsened and on Christmas Day she died.\n\nYour last dollars were spent on her funeral and tombstone.\n\nDays later your house was repossessed; destitute and desperate you joined the millions travelling from town to town seeking work but there was nothing: one in three Americans were unemployed and there were no jobs available. Crime became the answer for many, including you.\n\nOne desperate night you broke into a shop and stole food, drink and the money in the till: thirteen Dollars. The robbery was noticed by a passing policeman and though you tried to flee on foot you were cornered in an alley and arrested by several armed policemen. Taken to prison you were swiftly put on trial, convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Locked in a cell you were forgotten.\n\nIt is in prison that you met John Dillinger and his friends.\n\nJohn Dillinger, a handsome joker with an addiction for chewing gum, came to befriend you. He was in prison for a small-time robbery as well but because he used a gun he received a ten year sentence. He has been forgotten too: betrayed by his friends, rejected by his family and divorced by his wife. Over the years you became close friends with him and several other criminals, all convicted bank robbers. Over time you befriend Pete Pierpont, Red Hamilton, Charlie Makley, Russell Clark and Homer Van Meter, except for Homer all are surving lengthy sentences.\n\nFinally your day comes: in the spring of 1933 you and John are paroled on the same day, a short while later Homer is released from prison as well and moves away, drifting in and out of contact. On the day of your release Pete, Charlie, Red and Russell give you and John two lists: one of banks that they know would be easy to rob and one of fellow criminals you could team up with if you do plan a robbery. You throw away your lists, return to your hometown in Ohio and determined to go straight you try to get a legitimate job.\n\nPrison did not give you any money when you were released, make any arrangements to help you or even keep track of you. After three years the Depression still holds America in its terrible grip as strongly as ever - you only survive at all thanks to Soup Kitchens and Homeless Shelters and all your desperate attempts to get a job end in failure. Day after miserable day you sit on the streets or stand in the bread lines thinking about your friends in prison.\n\nFinally one summer day you have had enough: you travel to John\u0027s home in Mooresville, Indiana where you find your friend glad to see you. He has been planning a bank robbery of his own with two kids called William Shaw and Paul Parker that he met in a pool hall and he is glad to have you join them.

  "page 171": "John Dillinger was described by his friend Harry Pierpont as \"the kind of guy you would want for a brother\". He was an easy-going, friendly and charismatic person who chewed gum through his robberies, said things like \"Attaboy sport\" and avoided unnecessary killings and shootings (except one time) throughout his career.\n\nIn contrast to this his fellow outlaw Baby Face Nelson could fairly be described as a murderous psychopath who laughed on multiple occasions as he sprayed machine gun bullets towards innocent civilians including women and children. Dillinger\u0027s fellow outlaws were usually murderous too, to a lesser or greater extent, and most paid the price for their lives of crime.\n\nI am hugely indebted to Bryan Burrough\u0027s fantastic book Public Enemies (which was turned into a film starring a strangely charmless Johnny Depp as Dillinger), the FBI Reading Room Files about their manhunt of Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson Journal which is a great little website full of little bits of information about the Gang.\n\nThis story is part of the larger American Outlaws series, a set of books that are based mainly around the robberies, gunfights and shootings that various Outlaw gangs in American History were involved in. After heavy research these stories become incredibly easy to write as they are 90% based on true history, hence a 100 page story in a month becomes no major challenge once the research is done.\n\nThese non-fiction story-games are not choose your own adventures in the traditional sense of the term but it is a new approach to the genre that I hope will prove popular. In the future I want to experiment with new formats for the whole choose your own adventure concept and I want to sincerely thank any readers who have been patient or curious enough to read this far - their feedback good or bad really encourages and assists my writing so thank you.\n\nJohn once said \"all my life I wanted to be a bank robber, carry a gun and wear a mask. Now that it\u0027s happened I guess I\u0027m just about the best bank robber they ever had and I sure am happy.\"\n\nThose last four words are pretty much how I feel about writing. :D\n",

Finally at the end of November you all decide to seek shelter with a friend of Jimmy\u0027s in Wisconsin. You drive up to his home and are startled when a man in a suit comes out to meet you.\n\n\"Is Eddie here?\" Jimmy asks him.\n\n\"No,\" the man replies. \"He went downtown to do some shopping.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jimmy replies, reverses the car and drives away. As you drive down the road Jimmy glances at you.\n\n\"Sure as hell that was a G man and we caught him with his pants down,\" Jimmy says with a grim smile.

Startled you and John return fire with automatic rifles, the other car accelerates even more and quickly surges ahead out of sight. Your car is slowing down: one of the shots fired at your car has hit the motor. Suddenly a second car passing you in the other lane, again with two men in it pulls a U-Turn and begins following you. Cursing Jimmy pulls his car to the right and brakes, the other car brakes sharply ahead of you on the other side of the road.\n\nYou, Jimmy and John all jump out of your car and open fire with automatic rifles and machine guns on the two men in the other car. You can see one of the men is armed towards a machine gun, moving towards the back of the car, and the other man is armed with a shotgun as he moves towards the front of the car. You and John fire at them both.\n\nAt that moment Jimmy does something incredible: leaving the shelter of your own car which you have all been using as cover he begins to stride directly across the road, advancing in plain sight on the two rival gunmen who are almost certainly FBI Agents.\n",

You and John run forward and jump into the car as well, driving away from the two dead lawmen you have left at the scene. You can tell from looking at him that Jimmy is fatally wounded, you manage to get him to the safe house of some friend of his and lie him on the bed but it is too late.\n\n\"It\u0027s getting dark,\" Jimmy rasps to you. \"I can\u0027t see you anymore.\"\n\nMinutes later Jimmy dies. You and John make arrangements for the body to be dumped someplace where it can be found and discuss what to do. John has had enough of all this shooting: he has seen the other six members of the Dillinger Gang die now and though the newest recruit he has no wish to share their fate.\n\n\"I\u0027m going back to California to surrender,\" he tells you.\n\nYou consider your options: Cuba doesn\u0027t seem like a bad idea...\n",

Somehow you remain standing and as the lawman throws aside his shotgun and draws a pistol you raise your machine gun and shoot him once in the head. He falls dead to the ground.\n\nBoth of your opponents are down but you have been fatally wounded: Jimmy is lying motionless on the road, dead as well. You sink to the ground as John Chase stops firing and runs over but it is too late.
