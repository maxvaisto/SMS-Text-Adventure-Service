  "If you see a bright light, duck and cover!\nAdditional notes:\nI should point out that this story can be very long assuming you\u0027re not dying. Years pass and your surroundings will most likely change. You may very well live a life time in the story if you\u0027re lucky. You will also experience a completely different adventure depending on how you escaped the initial nuclear strike. (Assuming you do survive it.)\nAs with any of my writings, the \"story\" comes before the \"game\". However, this story was written in a \"game like\" format. So while there isn\u0027t a complex inventory and all of that, you can technically \"win\" by getting one of the 4 special endings. (You\u0027ll know if you get one because you\u0027ll get an epilogue)"
