  "page 123": "100 years later…\n\n“What we’re asking is reasonable sir. GZS just wants to use New Haven in a commercial to show the excellence of their products.”\n“Are you fuckin’ kidding me? I heard the stories passed down from my great-great-great grandfather who looked after the GZS central computer personally! And in his own immortal words: “GZS were a bunch of fuckin’ loonies with too much time on their hands, who built inferior shit!” Zachary yelled.\n“Sir! With all due respect this so called inferior product kept your ancestors alive! I think you at least owe GZS gratitude for your current existence!”\n“I don’t owe GZS shit! It was people like my ancestors who ensured my current existence! THEY built New Haven through hard work not GZS! Now get outta my office!”\n“Fine! You could’ve made a lot of money from this venture! We’ll just ask Last Chance instead!”\n“Last Chance? THERE? Okay. Good luck on dealing with the xenophobic government. Last I heard they’d completely closed themselves off to the outside world and were shooting anyone who came near the walls of the place…hmm, maybe you should go there after all.”\n\nGZS negotiator storms out of the room in defeat, while Zachary’s wife Carol came in.\n\n“Lemme guess, you turned down another GZS deal.”\n“Of course! Besides we’re doing alright.”\n“But you know they were offering a lot of money this time, it could really help New Haven.”\n“Carol, I love you. You know I do, but you’re from Ashtown you’ll never understand.”\n“Here we go…” Carol says hearing that remark from her husband many times before just like she was about to hear the same follow up speech before.\n\n“Those motherfuckers think they can waltz in after a hundred and fifty years and take the glory that my ancestors earned? No fuckin’ way. My family personally was responsible for most of the initial laws and practices still used to this day! Great-great-great grandma Nina was the FIRST shelter leader! It was her guidance and her husband’s technical knowledge that got the shelter through those first few hard years! Why I even heard about how he rebuilt the GZS computer from scratch because the damn thing was faulty to begin with! The both of them were pioneers!”\n\nZachary points out of his window to a nearby hill.\n\n“They both lie next to each other buried on that hill over there and I’ll be damned if I’ll let GZS cheapen their sacrifices or the sacrifices of ANY of my people!”\n“I gotta say, that speech never loses its zeal, even if you’ve said it over and over to everyone.”\n“It doesn’t lose its zeal, because it’s something I believe. I’m not just talking out my ass when I say that shit. I’m not selling this place out to GZS for some money. We’ll get by like we always have; hard work.”\n\n“Well that’s one thing you’ve always been good at hard work. I guess that’s what makes you one of the few excellent politicians.”\n“It’s in the genes Carol. Politicians and technicians, that’s what people in my family have always eventually become…well except for great-grandpa Henry. He became an explorer and kept insisting on calling himself Arizona or something…I dunno. They said his parents let him watch too many old movie vids. Nevertheless he always still called New Haven his home.” Zachary looked out at the same hill he pointed to a few moments ago and fell into silence.\n\nCarol smiled a bit, she knew Zachary was very proud of his heritage, perhaps a little bit misguidedly so, but still, it made him a better person who tried to do the right things, as well as someone she was glad she married. Even if he did go off on a tangent every now and then about how New Haven saved Ashtown’s “ass” from The Combine invasion forty five years ago.\n\n“You’re right Zach, so are you ready to go to this dinner function? As President of New Haven you’re kind of expected to be there you know.”\n“Huh? Oh yeah, I’ll be there in a moment. I just want a little time alone first.”\n\nAnother common habit Carol was used to, that one always puzzled her a bit since he was in politics, but that was just who he was. She knew he’d be down in a moment though. Carol left Zachary to his solitude.\n\nZachary cherished the silence he rarely got in his line of work and continued to look out on the hill where you and Nina were buried. He reminded himself that he would soon have to go visit your graves to put fresh flowers again.\n\nHe often wondered if you both were looking down on him from somewhere and proud of him.\n\n“Yeah… they are.”\n",
  "page 244": "Hiding won’t do any good, you have to get out the area altogether. Hopefully your infamous reputation hasn’t spread THAT far yet.\n\nOf course there’s the fact you have to get out of the area first. You make haste immediately.\n\nOver the course of a mere week, you’re hounded by attackers. You barely get out of the situations alive half of the time. You’re exhausted and can’t even afford to sleep for very long.\n\n\nEventually within the month your days soon come to an end, when a bounty hunter snipes you from a vehicle with a high powered rifle, striking you in the back. You don’t die right away though, but you’re in no condition to do anything as you collapse to the ground. The vehicle stops nearby and another one of your assailants kicks you over before finishing you off. You can’t help but be surprised by who you see.\n\n“Hey, now I got something for YOUR mouth!” Vivica says to you, before shooting you in the head.\n",
  "page 243": "You have to lay low somewhere for a few months, maybe even a year! However, you doubt if going to a town is going to be suitable. Your reputation at this point is pretty infamous, not to mention The Combine has a nasty habit of incorporating towns into their organization, if they aren’t affiliated already. Even an “Outlaw” town wouldn’t be suitable, you’d just have to watch your back even more, and bounty hunters aren’t adverse to entering those either.\n\nYou don’t know where to go, so you just start walking, it’s during this time when you find something that just might help you.\n\nIts something you haven’t though about in years…those old late night commercials you used to see before the bombs dropped. Ground Zero Survival. The corporation that was trying to sell their shelters to people. You remember when you were hiding in your basement after the attack, you thought about how much you should’ve bought a bomb shelter.\n\nIndeed, you wonder what things would’ve been like if you had…\n\nWell you’ve found one, sitting right here in the middle of nowhere. You go inside.\n\nYou enter the shelter entrance and see a single elevator door across from you and an ATM like machine nearby. Upon looking at the ATM machine thing, the display reads “ERROR”.\n\nYou press a few buttons and hit the machine a couple times, just to see what happens, to your surprise the elevator door opens up.\n\n“HELLO JOHNATHAN! YOUR IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED AND YOUR CARD HAS BEEN APPROVED! WE AT GZS HOPE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE A PLESANT STAY DURING THE APOCALYPSE!”\n\nHuh, that’s weird. You shrug your shoulders and guess the computer thinks you’re someone else. You briefly wonder what happened to the family that was supposed to use this shelter though.\n\nYou enter the elevator which goes down. You can’t help but notice there aren’t any call buttons on the thing, when you exit you also notice there aren’t any call buttons on the outside either.\n\nWhen it closes behind, you suddenly get the sinking feeling you’re trapped down here and you’re pretty much right.\n\n“What the hell kind of idiotic design is this shit? GZS must’ve been run by a bunch of fucktards!”\n\nBefore you worry about it, you explore the Shelter a bit more and this really isn’t so bad. You’re really well stocked here. Food, water, entertainment, comfortable living conditions. Actually it’s like a much bigger and better version of your old home outside of Cinderville.\n\nYou decide if you have to be a prisoner here, this isn’t really a bad way to spend it. You settle in and make yourself comfortable.\n\nTen years pass…\n\nTwenty years have passed and even you’re amazed you survived this long given all the things you did. Of course hiding down here probably helped.\n\nIn fact you’ve been reflecting on your past life lately. Or more accurately re-examining it. It’s weird since it was isolation that sort of set you on the dark path you chose, yet now, your isolation is creating a sense of regret and sorrow in you.\n\nAnd its not the isolation itself, it’s just the fact you’ve had more time to think about all the terrible things you’ve done in the past and much of it is extremely appalling. Unforgivable really.\n\nYou’ve lied.\nYou’ve stole.\nYou’ve tortured.\nYou’ve betrayed.\nYou’ve used people as slave labor.\nYou’ve murdered countless people.\nYou’ve killed children.\nYou’ve raped women.\nYou’ve orchestrated chaos.\nYou’ve committed numerous atrocities and you did it mostly all for your own pleasure.\n\nAnd oddly you’ve gotten away with all of it for the most part.\n\nWhy did you do any of it? You don’t even know why anymore, you’re just sorry that you did. You’ve begun to have nightmares about some of the things you’ve done. All the faces of your victims.\n\nIt’s like it’s all starting to finally catch up with you…in more ways than one.\n\nYou wake up in a cold sweat from one of your nightmares one day, except this time you see something at the foot of your bed. Something familiar, but strangely appropriate.\n\n\n“Y’know, everyone else stopped looking for you after you disappeared, but I knew if I continued my search, I’d find you eventually.”\n\nIt’s that mutant bounty hunter you saw ten years ago. At this range he really does look like death personified. In fact, you don’t think he’s a mutant at all. For the first time in your life, you feel fear, but there’s something very surreal about all of this.\n\n“You can’t be here! The elevator doesn’t work! I would’ve heard you coming down!” you say in disbelief.\n“Well you were asleep, but it’s amazing what you can block out of your mind, I think you know all about that don’t you?”\n“…how did you find me?”\n“You can’t hide from the past. Of course I think you know all about that too, right?”\n“I’m hallucinating! I’m seeing things that aren’t there. I’m sick!”\n“That’s probably the understatement of the decade. But you haven’t been well in twenty years and that’s why I’m here now. I can make it all go away. Tried to do it ten years ago, but you weren’t ready yet I guess.”\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you. This…being isn’t here to punish you at all; he’s here to release you. And it’s finally welcome.\n\n“Will you really make it all go away?” you ask with a quiver in your voice.\n“Of course, like I said that’s why I’m here.”\n“Oh good, thank you!” you begin to sob.\n\nThe pale being readies his weapon, but before he releases you, you still have some questions.\n\n“Wait, before you do it. Do you know why I did it?”\n“Because you could.”\n“That’s it?”\n“That’s it. All those other reasons you might’ve toyed with in the past were merely philosophical smoke screens to mask the truth from your mind. You did what you did, because you could. There is no deeper reason. The people who started World War three did it, because they could. None of it makes any sense, and any attempt to make sense of it, is meaningless. Your time here was meaningless. Whether you killed a bunch of people or you had saved a bunch of people, it wouldn’t have mattered. Life and world would’ve gone on regardless. You weren’t special, you never were. And you know it, deep down inside you know it.”\n\nFor the first time you finally see everything so clearly.\n\n“Yes…you’re right. I see that now.”\n“Of course I’m right…so now are you ready?”\n“Yes.”\n\nYou sit up in your bed and close your eyes. You hear the sound of a pistol being cocked and feel a steel barrel against your temple.\n\nYou breathe hard in anticipation.\n\nThen you hear a shot.\n",
  "page 125": "Maybe you’re high on your new found physique and adrenaline, but for whatever reason, something comes over you to volunteer. Indeed you’ve made everyone a little surprised by your actions especially since you’re an outsider. The Colonel looks at you with interest.\n\n\n“Hmm, you’re the one I’ve heard about from Marina, didn’t expect you to volunteer, she’s always mentioned you’re quiet loner type. Then again, you might be just what I need…alright you’re coming with me. Harry, you start picking some of the others and form recon detachments. Everyone goes on assignment tomorrow.”\n\nThe Colonel then takes you to his office, where he sits down and gets a bunch of papers from his desk.\n\n“Okay, I’m sure during your short stay here, you probably think we’re all a bunch of survivalist militia loonies, and to a certain extent, we probably are, however we aren’t without a plan.”\n\nThe Colonel shows you some blueprints to what looks to be a small military base.\n\n“My friend Alex was stationed at this base. It’s not exactly close by, but its closest military base around here.”\n“Didn’t realize there were any military bases in the area.”\n“Most people don’t, it was a top secret, and kept off the records so it wouldn’t be targeted. There aren’t even any roads leading to the place, you have travel by foot. Though I guess you could say it wasn’t so much of a military base as it was a research facility. Obviously I know about it, because I had a friend stationed there who was feeding me information. He didn’t exactly run the place, but he was attempting to work his way up to get special level clearance. Apparently GZS was working with the government on some high tech weaponry.”\n”GZS?”\n“The Ground Zero Survival Corporation. I’m sure you’ve heard of them, they were the ones hawking their Shelters like snake oil salesmen before doomsday.”\n“Oh yeah, I used to see their commercials on late at night, I thought about buying one of those.”\n“Well good thing you didn’t, only an idiot would’ve bought one of those things. Look at this.”\n\nThe Colonel now shows you a schematic of a GZS Shelter.\n\n“Why? It certainly looks just as equipped as this compound and has a lot more conveniences.” You remark.\n“It would appear that way, but the fucking thing is a death trap. They engineered them so once you entered; you most likely couldn’t get out of them. Supposedly the GZS computer is supposed to let you out when it deems that it’s safe to do so. In fact the whole thing is controlled by the computer. A computer that could glitch and break down at anytime. Let a machine be in charge of your survival…yeah great idea. I dunno about you, but I’ll take this compound any day. It might not look pretty, but I don’t have to worry about getting trapped with no access to food or water. Not to mention I heard from Alex that they suffered cutback during the creation of most of those things meaning they cut a lot of damn corners, so they probably aren’t as state of the art as they claimed. I’ll bet those dumb bastards who are living in those things are regretting it as we speak.”\n \nYou’re not sure where he’s going with all this so you interrupt.\n\n“So, what does all this mean? Are we going to seek out these shelters and rescue the people inside?”\n“What?! HA HA! That’s a good one!” The Colonel laughs. “Hell no son, as far as I’m concerned they’ve made their choice now they can live with it, we’re not here to play white knight. We have to look out for ourselves, and part of that is making sure we’re the best defended and from what I heard, whatever they were working on in that base, sounds like it would make things a lot easier in the defense department.”\n“Whoa, hold on, if this is a military base won’t they just shoot me on sight if I go there I mean won’t it be heavily guarded? I mean I know I went through some training, but I doubt to the degree that I can take on an entire military base!”\n“Alex was making friends with most of the lower personnel there, getting them to follow him as it were. Last I heard, he was pretty successful, so chances are, as long as I gave you some identifiers to take with you proving that you were following my orders, you wouldn’t have any problems when you arrived, but obviously there IS a problem or I wouldn’t be sending you at all.”\n“Of course…” you say expecting this assignment to be even more complicated.\n“I haven’t heard anything from Alex for a month before the bombs dropped. I dunno what’s happened to him.”\n“Is it possible they discovered he was leaking information and killed him?”\n“I suppose, but chances are that afterwards they would’ve found out about us and also sent the National Guard as well as GZS private security here to lay waste to this compound.”\n“Well the National Guard were busy trying to maintain order to the major cities at the time. I should know I was there when they were stationed in the one I was working at.”\n“True, but I still think they would’ve sent someone here, and GZS still would have. As I said they had enough money to pay for their own security force. Maybe not as well trained as military personnel, but fanatical enough to eliminate anyone that GZS thought was discovering secrets about them. That’s why Alex always focused on solely making friends with the grunts and government officials. The GZS employees always seemed a bit more dedicated to their corporation.”\n“Okay, well is it possible that the base wasn’t so secret and it got hit after all?”\n“Nope, mainly because I get the impression the background radiation level would be a hell of a lot higher, if that got nuked, so I’m pretty sure the place is intact, in fact I’m guessing its been abandoned. We recently figured out their frequency, we never used it before for obvious reasons, but now, why not? We’re getting a signal, but no verbal answers from anyone. To sum up, I want you to go there to scout and explore as much as you can. Find out what the hell happened to Alex if possible, and let me know if that high tech weaponry is worth anything or just more bad engineering by GZS. Here. You’ll probably need this security pass to enter, got it from Alex, last time he was here; I hope it’s still valid. And here’s my ring and a letter, if Alex IS still alive then those will prove that you’re working for me. That’s all I can do to help other than to give you a map to the place and what equipment you think you’ll need.”\n\nBefore you leave you have to ask.\n\n“Okay why me?”\n“Why you? You volunteered son!”\n“I know, but for this particular job, surely you have others more qualified to tackle it.”\n“Eh…you MIGHT think that, but to be quite honest, no. I mean don’t get me wrong I see all of these people here as family, but a lot of them are a bunch of weekend warriors who were playing survival. I’m sure in the years to come we’re going to see who’s a REAL soldier and who isn’t. Not that it matters, I mean I’ll find something for them to do, but you’re different. You certainly aren’t some commando, but there’s definitely something about you that makes you seem a bit more…detached from everything else. Like you’ll be willing to do what’s necessary to survive without hesitation. While you may never have been in a situation like this one, I got a feeling you’ll do just fine. Besides Marina’s previous beaming remarks about you are good enough for me. Now go get some rest, you’ll be leaving tomorrow.”\n\nYou head back to your room and think about what the Colonel said. He might be right in a lot of ways, but you still wonder if he’s sending you because as he said, “All these people here are like family, but you’re different.” Maybe if you get killed it won’t feel like such a loss. You don’t think anymore about it, mainly because Marina enters your room to interrupt your thoughts.\n\n“I hear you’re leaving tomorrow, I just want to tell you how brave I think you are for doing this for all of us. I know we didn’t get a lot of quality time with each other, but I wanted us to spend at least what could be the last time I see you together.”\n\nMarina’s ominous words that imply how much danger you’re possibly getting yourself into might worry you more if she wasn’t on top of you right now…\n\nThe next day you load up with what you think you might need, water, food, rifle, pistol, knife, Geiger counter, all the basic essentials. You get a bunch of goodbyes and good lucks. Harry merely sneers and mentions he expects you to get yourself killed twenty feet after you leave. The Colonel is a little more supportive and gives you a silent salute, but you like Marina’s goodbye kiss best of all.\n\nAnd with that, you’re on your way. It’s actually amazing to see that the outside world doesn’t look drastically different, you can only assume the bombs didn’t hit near your area. When you’re out of sight of the compound, you go back to thinking about this mission you volunteered for and wondering if you should go through with it. You do have the suitable equipment and skills to survive off the land after all.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to just go AWOL as it were…\n",
  "page 127": "You start briskly walking ahead, Roger suddenly notices.\n\n“Hey what’s your fucking hurry?”\n“I’m not waiting around for your slow asses, you’re taking too fucking long with all the goddamn talking. I’m gonna scout out ahead, I’m supposed to be on point right? I’m taking the risk, so what the hell do you care?”\n“But…oh fuck it, go on ahead and get yourself killed then, we’ll be right here. Better be back by nightfall though, because we’ll assume you’re dead and leave without you.”\n“Yeah, yeah.”\n\nYou leave the three stooges to their idiotic conversation, and proceed to go about your way, amongst the ruined buildings. It’s weird to walk through the city and it being so quiet with no other people around. Ah, by yourself again, it’s been awhile since you’ve had any private time to yourself. The Compound doesn’t really allow for it. In fact with all this time to finally have to yourself gives you the opportunity to seriously consider leaving the Compound like you were thinking about earlier. It would be easy, all you have to do is wander off, and Roger did say they would assume you were dead by nightfall. You think about Marina though, you do like her…but you also like not having to have an asshole who hates you barking orders at you all the time too.\n\nWhile you’re struggling with the delimma of your current living situation, you suddenly hear a gravelly voice nearby and some slow shuffling.\n\n\n“Meeeeeeeeat...(Wheez)”\n\nYou turn your head to see a walking horror. A man with badly distorted features and limbs hobbles in your direction. One of the bomb victims no doubt. You knew you had to run into them eventually. The problem is now more of them are starting to appear, and they look like they can do more damage. Many of them have a half-crazed appearance and severe radiation burns. Apparently their minds have damaged along with their bodies.\n\nThese ones aren’t even making an attempt to speak; they’re just looking at you menacingly and growling. They’re beginning to encircle you.\n",
  "page 248": "Given the whole suspicious nature of this set up you have a feeling the truth will not help you here; you’ll have to bullshit your way it. You try to remember some of the stuff you were reading on the documents upstairs.\n\n\n“No, I’m from GZS Headquarters, Shipping Division. And I hope you got some answers because there’s been a bunch of fucking mistakes in where things were getting transported! Who are YOU?”\n“…I’m Owen! What the fuck? I ain’t in charge of that! I’m just security!”\n“I don’t give a shit WHO you are! Where’s your supervisor?”\n“…I..uh…I guess Lisa is my supervisor, but she’s not here!”\n“Oh? And where the hell is she? GZS Headquarters is VERY displeased!”\n“I don’t understand, Lisa wasn’t in charge of any kind of shipping. She was an egghead! A researcher! We were down here for…other reasons…but you should know that!”\n“LOOK! I work in a cramped fucking office with boring paper work all goddamn day, I don’t have a window, someone keeps stealing my stapler, and they don’t tell me shit unless it’s to scream at my fucking face. I don’t care WHY you’re here! All I know is; I got my ass chewed out by HQ for someone else’s fuck ups! We got Shelters all over the goddamn tri-state area with mixed up equipment during the building process and we’re only NOW just finding out about it! You know how BAD that makes us look to our customers? I got sent down here to see if I could find out anything and all I’ve found out is the goddamn City is crawling with fucking cannibalistic mutants! Now that I’ve FOUND someone who might have some answers for me, I’m not just gonna dismiss that! So open up the goddamn door and let me in!”\n\nYour act and tone is very convincing of someone who’s had to deal with red tape and silly corporate orders. (Though you do know something of them having had to deal with them at your own job in your “old life”) obviously the security guard knows about them as well, because he lets you in.\n\nWhen the door opens up, you see a surprisingly scrawny man. You were expecting someone a little more burly, but he still wields an assault rifle slung around his shoulder making the need for physical strength unnecessary.\n\n“You…you don’t look like a GZS employee…shouldn’t you be in a suit and tie or something?”\n“I’m not gonna be running all over the nuclear wasteland in a hot ass suit and tie! Shit, I swear we hire dumber and dumber security guards each year. Just goes to show even natural selection fails sometimes in the face of near mass extinction. So where the hell is this Lisa?” you ask walking past him and noticing the well lit room and its sterile appearance. Some sort of generator sits in a corner giving off a low hum.\n\n“I told you she’s not here; she went to the surface again. She should be back soon.” The security guard says still eyeing you suspiciously.\n“Again? Why’s she going up there in the first place? Ain’t nothing left up there.”\n“You’re telling me. I went up once and nearly got myself killed. Since then Lisa says she’d rather me stay guard here and not get in the way of here so called research. Fine by me.”\n“I still don’t understand, what’s this research?”\n“Uh…well…um…it’s supposed to be a secret. I’m really surprised you being from HQ that you don’t know about it…”\n“I told you, I get BURIED in paperwork, and they don’t tell me shit. I mean I’ve heard things here and there, but I don’t know what else was going on here.”\n“Well…I guess it really doesn’t matter now…I mean what’s done is done and HQ probably should know anyway…okay well you know how GZS has dealings with the military and the government and shit right?”\n“Sure.”\n“Well it’s something like that going on, but I don’t know the intricate details about it, just what I know from Lisa, but I guess GZS was trying to develop some sort of radiation drug, y’know something to make the body immune to the shit.”\n“That does sound pretty useful, but this place doesn’t exactly look like a complex lab for doing something like that.”\n“Oh, its not. This is just a research outpost as it were. The real drug was made somewhere else, but it needed to be tested right? So they decided to test it here, a batch of it got dumped in the water supply months before the bombs hit. The idea is that the survivors of the initial blast would still be able to live and not get cancer, sterility or tumors and all that other bad shit that radiation causes. So even people caught in the cities would survive and be able to eventually rebuild and get civilization up and running again. I think they wanted to dump the drug into ALL the major cities, but it looks like world war three happened sooner than they though eh?”\n\nWhat you just heard sounds like some sort of science fiction tale! Then again being the cynic you are, you can’t say you’re completely surprised by it. Though now you have a more important question.\n\n“Okay, but if that was the intention…what’s with all the mutants in the City trying to eat me?”\n“Uh…well…I guess it didn’t work the way it should’ve? That’s sort of why Lisa and me were still here. Lisa was supposed to record the results of the drug after the bombs hit and that’s what she’s been doing. Lisa says the drugs are affecting people’s minds, and combined with the already fucked up situation I’d say it probably explains a lot already. Though I gotta say there was some pretty bad rioting even before the bombs dropped so I wonder if the drug was starting to affect the minds of people even then…but that’s silly I mean me and Lisa haven’t been affected by it at all, I dunno.”\n“YOU and her drank the water too?”\n“Well yeah, our personal water recycling system has it. I mean if we were going to be here, we damn well had to be pretty resistant to radiation…wait a minute I just realized something… you mean GZS sent you down here without this knowledge? Oh shit! You realize how many rads you’ve probably soaked up without the drug’s protection? Oh man, you were right! They must hate your guts at HQ! Ha ha ha ha ha! Sucks to be you!” Owen laughs uncontrollably\n“Yeah, yeah…”\n“Man, I mean shit! They pretty much sent you to die!  I mean really why the hell would they worry about whether shelters got the right equipment shipments now for anyway? GZS already got their money, did you actually think they were going to go send someone personally to each shelter correct the mistakes? They were already built man! Use your head!”\n“Uh huh, so…”\n“Ha ha ha ha! I mean damn, you work in shipping, GZS fucking up shouldn’t even be news to you! Look at what happened with this goddamn anti-radiation drug! I mean what asshole fucking moron thought up those shelter elevator designs?”\n“Why what’s wrong with the elevator designs?” you ask innocently, which suddenly puts Owen in a less jovial mood, he begins to get suspicious again.\n\n“Something ain’t right here…anyone who works for GZS knows how idiotic the computerized shelter elevator set up is. People got fired for that one. Why hell why do you think WE have a ladder? You claim you’re from HQ and you don’t know? I don’t care HOW much you say you’re out of the loop… I’m a lowly security guard and even I heard about the fucked up elevator designs!”\n\nOwen goes for his assault rifle slung on his shoulder, and you charge slamming him into the wall with an elbow to his face. You then pistol whip him a couple times before taking his rifle away from him. He holds on to his bloody face looking at you.\n\n“Ughhhh, shit…my face…” he groans.\n“Okay look, I was probably wrong for lying about working for GZS and…”\n“Fuck you…you goddamn piece of shit…”\n“HEY! Asshole! I’m the one with the gun here! Now I don’t want to kill you, but…”\n\nOwen unsuccessfully tries to grab his rifle back, you kick him back down.\n\n“Are you fuckin’ kiddin’ me? I nearly shot you, dumb fuck! I’d probably be able to kick your ass even without these guns, so you better just calm…”\n\nOwen once again attempts to attack you, this time you butt him with the rifle hard, and kick him out the door then lock it.\n\n“Fuck you then asshole! Let the mutants eat you!” you shout, you expect to hear banging on the door, or even pleading, but you don’t hear anything. After a few hours pass, you open up the door, and Owen is gone. You close the door back up and explore your surroundings a bit more.\n\nThere’s not much to explore though, just two simple bedrooms, an eating area, bathroom and the “living area” which you’re already familiar with. The generator provides power, and a water recycling system provides water. Looks like there’s some sort of food dispensing system as well, though what it dispenses isn’t particularly tasty. You could be set up here for awhile if you wanted to be, though perhaps you just want somewhere to rest first before getting out of the city.\n",
  "page 126": "Maybe you’re a leaner meaner fighting machine now, but that’s still no reason to be foolish and volunteer for things. Eventually The Colonel picks someone at random and tells Harry to start assigning recon detachments.\n\n“Alright you fuckin’ bottom feeders, its time to put all that fuckin’ training to good use! We’re gonna go scout out the nearest towns we know of. Now I’m sure you know there were a lot of little towns dotted all over the place in these parts, are job is to make contact and see what the situation is. Don’t be surprised if they open fire on you immediately. Catastrophes tend to make people behave like animals…and that’s where we’re coming in. We’re here to be the tamers, just like the Colonel said, now then, Dixon, Bradson, Wilson, Copperheim! You’re Alpha Team. Sams, Barns…”\n\nHarry goes down a list assigning people. Time passes and you’re one of the last people left. You can’t help but notice that the ones left aren’t exactly the most competent. You start wonder if you’ll just be assigned to Compound duty, which you wouldn’t really mind since it offers less opportunity to get shot at.\n\nYour wonder is soon dispelled, when Harry puts down his list and addresses the rest of you directly.\n\n\n“Alright now the rest of you fucking shit eating pansies get a different assignment, because you’re so goddamn special like a fucking epileptic retard. You folks get to go to the CITY!”\n\nNobody looks too enthusiastic about that idea, except you’re the only one with any balls to protest since you know Harry hates you anyway.\n\n“The fucking city, are you kidding? It’s probably been nuked into slag! There can’t be anything useful there!”\n“Y’know, I expected that kind of cowardly shit from you, so that’s why you’re going to be point man for the entire mission! Anyway, we don’t know if the city has been completely destroyed, chances are that it not being a major city and its low importance, it may not have been hit with anything larger than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima back in old World War 2.”\n“OH well then, I’m SURE it’ll be safe to enter then!” you reply.\n“Shut your fucking mouth and stop being a bitch! You’re all going to be wearing radiation suits anyway, which will keep your yellow ass safe. That alleviate your worries cupcake? Fuckin’ pussy ass faggot. You oughta be glad you’re even here in the first place. You don’t like the fuckin’ rules, you can fuckin’ leave and see how well you fare on your own. Now what’s it gonna be Nancy Boy?”\n“Fuck it, fine, whatever.” You retort giving in, but still weighing the option of possibly leaving later.\n\n“Yeah, that’s what I thought cupcake. Alright, go pick up your equipment and get ready to set off, you’ll be using one of the vehicles since the City is pretty far away. If in the event that cupcake IS right and the place is a glowing hole, then return immediately. Another thing the Colonel wants this mission secret, so don’t fucking mention it to anyone else in the Compound! I find out you have and you’re fucking history! This means you don’t tell your little girlfriend, cupcake!”\n\nYou all leave, with Harry still giving you a dirty look for your insubordination. You wonder if you shouldn’t just leave when you exit the Compound. Take the equipment and then just disappear, who’s going to come after you? It’s not like there’s going to be MPs searching for you all over the wasteland.\n\nThe night before you leave, Marina comes to see you.\n“I hear you’re leaving tomorrow, and I know we didn’t get a lot of quality time with each other, but I wanted us to spend at least what could be the last time I see you together.”\n\nMarina’s apparently not familiar with the fact that you didn’t really have a choice in the matter, but since she’s on top of you right now, you’re not going to bring up the issue…\n\nThe next day you load up with what you think you might need, water, food, rifle, pistol, knife, Geiger counter, radiation suit, all the basic essentials, before you zoom off in the beat up car that’s passing for your transportation to the city.\n\nYou sit in the back seat, while your other three teammates Steve, Albert and Roger are talking with each other. Mostly about things that don’t matter, none of them seem to even be thinking about the fact that you’re possibly driving into a glowing hole in the ground. And you don’t give a shit what you’re wearing. All the lead panties in the world aren’t going to completely protect you, if you’re standing at ground zero! You end up going back to sleep for the first day of the trip, only being periodically awakened by the laughter your team mates.\n\nOn the second day you stare out the window and see that the landscape has gotten worse looking as you get closer to your destination. The surrounding countryside around the Compound looks relatively untouched compared to what you’re starting to see now. For shits and giggles, you roll the window open and shove part of the Geiger counter outside to get a reading, it starts clicking like a cricket and crack.\n\n“Hey! Roll up that window; you’re letting all the radiation in! Ha ha!” Albert exclaims, who’s sitting next to you. Idiot.\n“Check it out, looks like the city survived after all…well more or less.” Steve says who’s doing the driving.\n\nYou turn your attention forward and see the shattered “skeletal” remains of skyscrapers looming in the distance. The city got hit, but apparently by something “small” and probably exploded high in the air. Of course that doesn’t make you feel any better.\n\nSteve stops the car just outside the city limits mainly because the road is being blocked by burned out shells of other vehicles. You all pile out of the car.\n\n“Alright I think we can take it from foot on here, we probably shouldn’t try to drive the car in the city anyway, we need to conserve gas. Alright you’re in the lead.” Steve says to you.\n“What? Why am I in the fucking lead?” you ask.\n“Because Harry said you fuckin’ were, CUPCAKE! Ha ha!” Albert laughs.\n“Yeah, besides, you worked in the city, none of us did, so you probably know the place than we do.”\n“What, so none of you assholes ever visited the place?”\n“Maybe a few times, not really enough to get deeply acquainted with it, look you’re outnumbered, and you’re taking lead, and that’s that. Don’t worry we’ll be right behind you.” Roger replies.\n“After seeing how you fuckers shoot, I don’t know if that’s stupider than going into a radioactive city to begin with.”\n\nYou take lead and begin walking; meanwhile your team members go back to talking about shit that doesn’t matter again. Given their attention span, you wonder if you wouldn’t just be better off exploring by yourself.\n",
  "page 247": "“Uh, no.” you reply\n“Who the fuck are you?”\n“I’m a survivor like you, I came to the City to get supplies, but I got attacked by some sort of mutant things or something, and I got temporarily trapped here.”\n“Ha ha! You are one stupid motherfucker then! Why the hell would you come BACK to a bombed out city for ANY reason?” the voice mocks.\n“Well why the hell are you here?”\n“Business.”\n“What kind of business?”\n“That’s for me to know and for you not to know. Now get the fuck outta here, you don’t belong here. This is GZS property an’ you obviously aren’t an employee in any shape or form.”\n“Can’t you let me in?”\n“NO!”\n“Fuck you! There’s a bunch of cannibalistic mutants up there!”\n“Shoulda though about that before your stupid ass came to the city.”\n“Oh fuck this, I’ll just blow the handle off the door and...”\n“You blow the handle off and I’ll blow your head off as soon as you enter through door, though I doubt you will since it’s also barricaded and deadbolted from the inside. You ain’t getting in here unless you’re packing some serious firepower. Better just go away and try to get out of the City before it gets dark.”\n\nYou shout a few more things at the voice behind the door, but it doesn’t reply back, you think about shooting at the door, but you’ll probably only be wasting bullets that you’ll undoubtly need.\n\nHaving no other options you head back to the surface where after making a quick check to see if the coast is clear which it is so you continue your attempt at escape from the city as night begins to fall.\n\nUnfortunately you don’t get far before the roving gangs of mutants stumble upon you again; these ones seem even more vicious and organized though. After a short game of shoot and run, eventually they manage to surround and trap you. Sensing that your death is near, you shoot yourself in the head to save yourself the pain of being eaten alive.\n\nThe mutants seem disappointed, but they eat you anyway.\n",
  "page 129": "You hastily make a break for it back to where your team is situated; unfortunately, “the survivors” are in your way and attempt to stop you. You shoot a couple of them, but not before a few of them manage to wound you. A couple of them manage to tear through your suit with their ragged and jagged, dirty nails (Which are almost like claws at this point) You suffer some scratches to the back and shoulders, but the worst is when one of them actually bites through your suit drawing blood.\n\n“Motherfucker!” you shout shooting your assailant in the face and breaking away from the cannibal mob.\n\nYou run like mad with the horde chasing not far behind. When you finally reach your team, they all finally pay attention for the first time and start running back to the car!\n\n“HEY WAIT FOR ME YOU BASTARDS!” you yell, stepping up your pace.\n\nEventually you just barely manage to get inside the car before Steve drives off. A couple of the city dwellers jump on the back of the car, but a shotgun blast through the back window gets them off.\n\n“Holy shit Albert! What the fuck?! Was it necessary to destroy our back window?” Roger shouts.\n“Oh I’m sorry I didn’t know we were taking back survivors to the Compound, oh shit you’re wounded man!” Albert says looking at you.\n“Ah I’m alright, there’s medical supplies back at the Compound.”\n“No man! I mean you’re bit and shit! You’re gonna turn into one of those things!”\n“For fuck’s sake Albert, this ain’t a low budget zombie film. It doesn’t work like that!”\n“I dunno, I mean how do you know? I mean you saw them, sure they were still alive, but radiation might do all kinds of weird shit!”\n“Yeah, Albert’s got a point. We don’t know what the hell was in the air either and your suit was ripped. For all we know there was some sort of biological agent in the air too. Who knows what was dumped on the place. You could bring back some virus and infect everyone.” Roger says.\n“If you think these suits protected us from everything, you’re a goddamn idiot in the first place…”\n\nSuddenly you feel the butt from Albert’s shotgun smack against the side of your skull, while Roger tells Steve to stop the car. You’re too dizzy to fight back properly so you just pull the trigger on your rifle which results in you shooting Steve through the back several times before you get another smack in the head and getting your rifle taken from by Albert.\n\nRoger then gets out of the car and opens up the door on your side to drag you out. Giving you a few kicks before pointing his gun at your face.\n\n“Now I’m not killing you because you might be infected, I’m killing you because you just murdered my friend you sonofabitch!”\n\nRoger then shoots you in your half-conscious state.\n",
  "page 128": "You may not like this mission, and you may not like the people you’re with, but it’ll be a lot safer if you stick with these idiots, because you have a bad feeling about this place. In the meantime while you keep your eyes open, your ears are assaulted by your teammates’ conversation.\n\n“I’m telling you she touched my hand dude! She’s totally into me! I’m gonna talk to her more when we get back.” Albert exclaims.\n“Bullshit, you didn’t get anywhere with Vivica! I should know because I fuckin’ tried once and she didn’t give me any kind of play! I think she’s a fuckin’ dyke anyway.” Roger replies.\n“Why the hell does she have to be some kind of dyke? Couldn’t be that she didn’t like\nyour ugly ass?”\n“Fuck off Albert, go ahead and make an idiot of yourself trying to hit on some carpet muncher. I don’t give a shit; I’m just trying to keep you from wasting your time.”\n“Oh…well maybe she’ll let me watch or something.”\n“Yeah, right. That never happens except in the movies.” Steve says.\n“The other problem with that plan, I can’t think of any other woman in the Compound that might swing that way. Not unless you were some smooth pimp motherfucker that could talk her into it and given that you’re far from that Albert, I’d say you’re shit out of luck.”\n“Well couldn’t one of you guys help me? I mean, you could try to talk your girlfriends and we could all watch or something.”\n“Yeah, there’s a problem with that plan too Albert, namely neither one of those fuckers got girlfriends either.” You interrupt.\n“Ha fuckin’ ha. Nobody asked you for your opinion smart ass.” Roger remarks annoyed.\n“Hey, do you think you could maybe talk to Marina then?”\n“Everyone shut the fuck up I hear something!”\n\nAfter looking around and up, in a split second of total silence, Roger speaks again.\n\n“There’s nothing here, this city was fucking annihilated, ain’t nothing alive except maybe rats and roaches. I dunno even know why we’re so worried to begin with, do you think if anyone WAS still left alive they would be in any condition to…”\n\nSuddenly Rogers head explodes like a ripe melon after getting hit by a shotgun blast coming from the second floor window of a nearby building. The “thing” holding the shotgun is reloading and alerting his fellows.\n\n“MEEEEEEEEAAAT!” it screeches in a raspy voice.\n\nMore figures start appearing. Most have a half-crazed appearance and severe radiation burns. Apparently these bomb survivors have had their minds damaged along with their bodies.\n\n“Holy shit, we’re gonna die!” Albert screams and starts firing at everything. You and Steve do likewise while retreating back to the car. Before you all manage to leave the immediate area, the thing with the shotgun manages to get off another shot, blasting Albert in the leg, tearing it off. He screams and tries to crawl away, but is quickly mobbed and the last thing you see of him is some of the freaks sinking their teeth into him.\n\n“GET THE FUCK MOVING STEVE!” you shout stepping up your pace.\n\n \nEventually you and Steve manage to get back to the car and speed off back to the Compound. Steve is pretty upset and while there isn’t any traffic on the road, you still don’t want him to be crashing into something else.\n\n“Steve calm the fuck down, and get a hold of yourself!”\n“Fuck you man! Didn’t you see that?! They fuckin’ killed Roger! And they ATE fuckin’ Albert! Aw shit man! Shit! They’re gonna come after us!”\n“I doubt that, they don’t even know where we’re from. Just be glad we got out of there. It was a stupid idea to go there in the first place. There’s nothing there except crazed radioactive cannibals. I’m gonna tell Harry that much when we get back. Nobody’s going there again, especially not me!”\n\nYou’re pretty pissed about this whole affair really and the more you’re thinking about it; maybe you should just not return to the Compound, you have enough equipment and supplies to keep you in good shape for awhile. All you’d have to do is get rid of Steve and take the car.\n",
  "page 77": "Can’t be any worse than what’s going on now, and you might as well be on the winning team.\n\n“Alright, I’m in. What do we do?”\n\nElliot smiles.\n“Glad to have you on board, as for what we do, you’ll see. You’ll all see. Leon, and Brenda you’re all coming with me. The rest of you go back to your rooms, tomorrow your loyalty will be rewarded, I promise.”\n\nElliot and his gang leave, you close the door and go back to sleep without thinking anymore about it.\n\nThe next day you hear a lot of yelling and screaming when you wake up, you get dressed and leave your room to see what’s going on. You see a crowd of people gathered outside Ron’s door. You make you way through the crowd and see Leon holding Nina who is struggling and hysterical. Elliot is nearby speaking.\n\n“I DIDN’T DO IT! YOU’RE LYING! YOU’RE ALL LYING! (Sob)”\n“I saw her! I saw her lurking around last night when I heard some noises. I just wish I’d done something then! I’ll never forgive myself. I just thought she was taking a walk, little did I know she was going into Ron’s room and killed him! Why? Because she found out he was having an affair with his secret lover William!”\n“What the fuck…?” you say to yourself and take a quick look inside Ron’s room. You see Ron’s body lying in a pool of blood on the floor in his underwear, his throat has been slashed. Nearby is another body killed in the exact same way. Its William who you really didn’t know anything about, you guess you know he was gay now though.\n\n“Huh. I guess that explains why Ron never took any interest in Nina.” You say to yourself. Meanwhile Elliot is continuing his speech.\n\n“She even dropped the killing weapon outside her door! Brenda found it when she was going to talk to her this morning! Look!” Elliot shouts when Brenda shows everyone a bloody scalpel.\n“THAT’S NOT MINE! I DIDN’T DO IT! I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW RON WAS GAY!”\n“Oh we ALL didn’t know Nina, until we found his dead body! But we all know that YOU had a giant crush on him and practically stalked him. It isn’t hard to connect the dots here Nina! You found out he was carrying on with William and you in a jealous rage killed them both! Now granted William and Ron were breaking GZS policy with their behavior, but they didn’t deserve this! To be brutally murdered by an insane love sick stalker!”\n“I’M NOT A STALKER! (Sob) I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING YOU FUCKING BASTARDS!”\n“Enough! It’s apparent that we need to punish you, for your heinous crimes. Though I feel you deserve death, I am in no position to determine your ultimate fate…I say the people should decide!”\n\nSome of the people in the crowd begin to chant “Death!”, and most of those are followers of Elliot. It doesn’t take long for the rest of the crowd to follow. Elliot’s got ‘em all by the balls. He has completely manipulated this herd of sheep into believing and following him, on little to no basis in evidence. They’re all just believing what he’s telling them. You know damn well he’s set this whole thing up to blame poor Nina. You can’t really do anything about it though; nobody’s going to believe you.\n\nIt’s too late anyway, after a few more words from Elliot, you see Leon carry out the crowd’s wishes and break Nina’s neck. Now Elliot makes another speech.\n\n“It is done…it is regrettable, but it is done. Leon, you and some of the others please dispose of these bodies in the incinerator…I didn’t think we would have to use it so soon and under such tragic circumstances. I suppose we’ll need another shelter leader now to guide us through this dark time…well whoever is proposed, I hope they will be willing to listen to some of my ideas about how we should increase security around here so nothing like this ever happens again.”\n\n“Hey! How about you become our shelter leader Elliot? You certainly know how to take charge of a situation and you obviously are concerned about all of us!” another one of Elliot’s lackeys shouts from the crowd where upon a short time later everyone else is following again.\n\nYou stand watching a complete fraud take over with mere words. It would appear that even after Armageddon some things never change. Elliot goes through a modesty routine to make him look good and then “humbly” accepts.\n\nYou may have just allied yourself with a ruthless sociopath at best or a complete mad man at worst. Time will have to tell.\n\nFive years pass…\n\nTime tells that you’ve allied with a completely ruthless sociopathic mad man.\n\n\nThe Shelter’s population has grown a little; but not excessively. In fact you’re likely to have room for quite some time. Elliot employed a vicious sterilization program to make sure of that. Having a medical background he was able to do the procedures himself with the medical supplies in the shelter. Shortly after he started employing that procedure the initial “cult of personality worship” by everyone stopped and a lot of people regained there senses, but of course by then Elliot had already entrenched himself. There were a few attempts to kill him, but those were always averted by Leon. Elliot now walks around with a couple guards at all times, with Leon is his head bodyguard.\n\nHe claimed that it was for the good of the shelter and granted perhaps it is going to make things easier, but it’s obvious that not everyone was keen on this idea. Most of the people who followed Elliot from the beginning were spared this fate though. Disobedience from anyone is punished severely.\n\nHowever things aren’t too bad for you.\n\nYou are pretty much indispensable and you keep it that way. You’re now in charge of maintaining the central GZS computer system which you primarily insist on doing by yourself. Eventually you manage to get the damn thing running at near maximum efficiency and nobody has too many problems with things breaking down anymore. You also do something else to ensure your safety which is carrying your gun secretly on you at all times. There have been times where you’ve wondered if you should kill Elliot, but you haven’t ever killed anyone before, let alone with no provocation, you don’t know if you have it in you. Also he hasn’t really bothered you, if anything you’re one of the few people he’s consistently been okay with.\n\nAs long as he’s not bothering you, you don’t really feel the need to kill him. He leaves you to do your job and you leave him to do his…\n\nBut is it ALWAYS going to be that way? There may come a day when for whatever reason he decides to get rid of you. Megalomaniacs aren’t particularly known for their trusting nature.\n",
  "page 76": "“Yeah, well you do what you have to do, just leave me out of it. Your little power struggle with Ron isn’t any of my concern. And if and when you do take power don’t think you’re going to be ordering me around either.”\n\nElliot’s expression changes to that of someone very perturbed by your response.\n\n“I’m very disappointed to hear you say that, I really thought you could have a place in the new community I was planning.”\n“Think again, now get outta here…”\n\nYou begin to shove Elliot out of your doorway, but Leon reaches over his shoulder and shoves you back with great strength. You fall backwards on to your floor, Elliot and his gang start to enter. He pulls out a scalpel, something he probably got from the medical supplies. You happen to be right next to your mattress, so you reach in and grab your pistol to point it directly at Elliot. Now they all look like they just seen a ghost and all the bravery has drained out of them except Leon, who looks like this isn’t the first time he’s had a gun pointed at him, but he’s still stepping back.\n\n“You wanna fuckin’ take another step motherfucker? Go ahead, I fuckin’ dare you!”\n“Holy shit, he’s got a fuckin’ gun Elliot!” a women in his group says.\n“I can see that Brenda! Okay, look maybe we got off on the wrong foot here. I mean obviously you’re a more resourceful man than I thought…I mean as far as I know you’re the only one in this place with a goddamn gun. How’d you manage that?”\n“Never you mind, just get the fuck outta here!”\n“Very well, but remember, you don’t have any friends in this place, and you can’t watch your back all the time…”\n\nElliot has just announced his intentions of eliminating you whenever it’s possible. You’ll have to live in constant paranoia now. Unless…\n",
  "page 79": "You decide there’s no need to kill Elliot. If the day should come where he begins to think about getting rid of you then you’ll kill him. You need a personal reason to do it; you can’t just do it on a whim.\n\nYou go back to your job and think nothing more of it.\n\nFive more years pass...\n\nYou’ve been down here ten years and you’re beginning to get a feeling of unease.\n\nElliot has turned this place in a cult compound. He’s had children by all the remaining fertile women in the shelter and sterilized just about all the remaining men. He’s completely indoctrinated everyone to think the way he does at this point, anyone who was still resisting him has been dealt with. He’s got complete obedience from everyone now. You get the impression that killing Elliot wouldn’t do much good at this point, since you’d just be overwhelmed soon afterwards by his followers.\n\nHe’s regained his cult of personality, and you’re just about the only remaining sane person left. Oddly Elliot still thinks highly of you, and has never tried to do anything to you either; he continues to let you do your job, with one exception. He’s been sending his older children to the computer room for you to teach them how to use and work on the central computer.\n\n“What’s this?”\n“Don’t touch that! That’ll be next week’s lesson!”\n“Can I access the game database?”\n“No!”\n“Ohhh I got a lady to appear on the screen and she’s naked!”\n“Stop that and pay attention!\n\nYou’ve become a glorified baby sitter, you’ve gone half insane and you’re ready to put the damn gun to your own head at this point.\n\nOver the years you’ve been wondering about the surface. You wonder if it wouldn’t be better than living in place. One time when you were considering leaving you overrode the safety controls to the elevator which would allow you to bring it down. You could bring it down. All you’d have to do is gather what supplies you think you’re going to need.\n\nThe only problem is thanks to the idiotic GZS shelter design; you’d need to trust Elliot’s kids to send you back up from the computer room.\n",
  "page 78": "You need to kill him, things are just going to get worse, or at best stay the same. All the shit that Elliot’s done over the years has gotten to you, and you can’t help, but feel partly responsible for all of this. Sure you don’t like most people, but you’re not a BAD guy. However you are serving a bad master. A really bad master, one that needs to be stopped now.\n\nYou take a deep breath and pace around the floor for awhile. Trying to psyche yourself up for your plan. You feel like you gotta take a shit, a piss, and vomit all at the same time. It’s all in your mind though. Its just nerves. You stare at yourself in a blank monitor screen.\n\n“You can do this…you can do this…” you repeat.\n\nYou then leave the computer room, ready to do what you have to do.\n\nYou don’t get far when you see Elliot walking around with two guards and Leon behind him. You also see him with his wife Brenda and their two daughters. (Of course he didn’t feel the need to make a “sacrifice” for the shelter)\n\n“Shit.” You say to yourself. You didn’t think you’d have to shoot somebody down in front of their goddamned children. You nearly turn back around to re-think this plan, but you stop yourself again. If you don’t do it now, you aren’t ever going to do it. Besides he’s seen you now anyway.\n\n“Hey! How’s our techie doin’? I’m surprised to see you out the computer room; I know how much you like to be alone. So what brings you out?”\n“Well, uh…there was something I really thought you needed to see…”\n“Oh? What is it?”\n“Just this.”\n\nYou pull your pistol out and you hesitate just long enough for Elliot to pull Brenda in front of himself resulting in you killing her instead. Leon catches Elliot from the blow back of Brenda’s body and whisks him of to safety. One guard attempts to run at you, but is tripped up when Elliot’s two daughters run screaming past him. The other guard reaches you, but you just manage to get a shot directly in his face. Gouts of his blood splatter in your own face temporarily blinding you.\n\n \nThe guard, who was momentarily tripped up, punches you in the face knocking you to the ground, he pulls out a knife to finish up the job, but with your hand still on your pistol, you fire a couple rounds in his chest causing him to slump to the floor beside you. You get up only to have the guard you just shot to stab you in the foot as a last act of revenge. You holler pain, and shoot him again, before pulling knife out of your foot.\n\nMeanwhile you begin to hear other people yelling, screaming and fighting. Apparently your actions have caused a small rebellion. You’ve given people the incentive again to fight back. Of course it’s going to be up to you to finish it. You limp as fast as you can attempting to stay out of the way of the major fighting, You see Elliot and Leon fighting some people and making quick work of them, you take the opportunity to open fire, blasting Elliot in the knee, he won’t be walking anywhere.\n\nLeon goes to pick him up, but you follow up with another couple shots, hitting him in the side. He goes down and attempts to crawl on top of Elliot, except Elliot kicks him away with his good leg and tries to crawl off instead. You finish off Leon and then kick Elliot in the face hurting your foot since you kicked him with the one that has the big gaping knife hole in it.\n\nElliot turns over holding his face and addresses you.\n\n“Why? I was your friend! I didn’t do anything to you! I left you alone! Look at what you’ve done to this place! It’s descended into chaos! You’ve destroyed everything I’ve accomplished here!”\n“I don’t care.” You say pointing the gun at him.\n“WAIT! GODDAMN IT WAIT! If you kill me, you’ll be making orphans out of my daughters! Can you live with that?”\n“No…I guess I couldn’t…”\n\nElliot smiles thinking he’s found a loop hole.\n\n“I suppose I’ll just have to kill them after I kill you.” you say.\n\nElliot’s eyes widen and you gun him down before he can retort. He dies a lot quicker than he should have, but at least he’s dead.\n\nYou were bluffing of course you wouldn’t shoot his children; you just wanted to see his expression before he died. It brought a feeling of satisfaction to you, like you really accomplish something before your own death…\n\nSomeone stabs you multiple times in the back with a scalpel while you were standing over Elliot. You fall mortally wounded, with anarchy all around you.\n\nYou don’t know if you made things better or worse, all you know is you won’t be around to find out.\n",
  "page 71": "100 years later…\n\n“Well I managed to download the data from this shelter, but if this shelter was supposed to have a talking AI it must’ve degraded or more likely GZS records are inaccurate as usual. I have no damn clue to as why we’re doing this anyway. We go to all these fucking shelters and they all got the same basic information! Does GZS just like wasting fucking money for these expeditions?”\n“You know the drill Kurt, we’re just here to do the job.”\n“Yeah I understand that Christina, but these jobs can be dangerous! Remember that one shelter where some crazy fucker had managed to download his consciousness into the goddamn thing? We lost two people on that job!”\n“Hey it happens. Roscoe, you get that door open yet?”\n“Almost. I don’t understand why this thing is jammed; it should’ve opened when we got the power back on.”\n“I don’t understand why GZS just doesn’t reuse these things instead of making new ones.” Kurt complains.\n“Because obviously these shelters were flawed and an embarrassing reminder to shoddy workmanship that GZS tries to avoid. That’s why we’re sent in to get the data, so they can study the results and improve upon it if possible.”\n“Do they REALLY think there’s going to be another fucking war? We’ve barely made contact with Europe again and if they’re any indication, no other nation on the planet is in any condition to be launching an attack of World War fuckin’ Three magnitude for a LONG ass time! I mean shit the US government isn’t even in complete control of its own goddamn country yet!”\n“That’ll be enough of your anti-patriotism Kurt!” Christina warns. “We won WW3! This was a great country and it will be again once it’s properly rebuilt!”\n\n“Got it open guys!” Roscoe yells. “I’m going in; hopefully there isn’t a rad rat infestation like last shelter!”\n\nAs Roscoe enters with his gun drawn he sees something very peculiar on the bed.\n“Guys! I think you should see this!”\n“What is it? Wow that’s something you don’t see everyday.” Kurt says. “That’s an old model LV64. I didn’t know GZS even stocked these in their shelters.”\n“They weren’t supposed to; these types of shelters were all suppose to have the SX100. The SX100 models had their own self-contained system and didn’t need to have an AI downloaded into them, they were pre-built that way. As far as I know GZS cancelled that idea when they had budget cuts and the robotics field was pretty much diverted to the military. These shelters weren’t supposed to have any robotic models at all, guess someone fucked up the records again.” Christina replies.\n\n“That might explain those gaps I was finding in the data files when I downloaded them. I thought it might just be due to equipment degradation, but the AI might be downloaded into that model.”\n“Well? What are you waiting for, go open it up and get the chip!” Christina orders.\n\nWhile Kurt approaches the bed, Roscoe points out the other figure. The one more human in origin.\n\n“Geez, you gotta be pretty desperate to fuck a robot. It doesn’t even have skin to make it human looking.”\n“Still looks better than some of the skanks I’ve seen you with Roscoe. I’m sure the poor bastard was down here for who knows how long, beggars can’t be choosers. Besides I get the impression there was a little more going on here than just sex. Look at how they’re embraced.”\n“Oh come on Christina. You don’t actually think they had some sort normal relationship do you? Hah!” Roscoe comments.\n\n“Bold words coming from the guy who pays for his one hour relationships. I don’t know what happened here, but I’m saying by the way they’re embraced denotes a closeness of some sort. In fact I find it strange that the LV64 is holding him, surely if the shelter owner died, the model would’ve still lived and ran through its normal maintenance routine until its power ran down, or even just returned to its original spot and just shut itself down. Instead it shut itself down while holding him. Something more was going on here.”\n\n“Well I’ll say. This model did more than just shut itself down, it terminated itself. I can see from the exterior, the CPU fried from the inside. You can see from the blackened ring and the small hole in the back of its head. There’s no point in opening it up, because there’s no way I can salvage this. This is just a hollow shell now. I suppose we could strip it for parts or something though.” Kurt says interrupting Christina.\n\nChristina is silent and takes a long look at the LV64 and the human remains. Somehow they both look very peaceful and content.\n\n“No. Just leave her be. She’s been through enough. We got everything of worth, time to bury this place, and them. Maybe we’ll have better luck at the next shelter.”\n\nChristina, Kurt and Roscoe exit the shelter the same way they came in and set the charges in the strategic locations. After standing back, the detonations cause the top of the shelter to collapse inward, forever burying the contents inside. The three GZS troubleshooters then drive off to their next assignment.\n\nYou and Eliza are never disturbed again.\n",
  "page 73": "“(Sigh) Fine, I’ll attend this exercise in futility, but what the hell are we doing exactly, so I’m not just jumping into shit.” You ask as you and Nina walk towards the conference room.\n“Well right now we’re voting on a shelter leader. Someone to make the final decisions about important things. So far Ron is tied with another. In fact the only reason why I came to get you, was so you could break the tie.”\n“Whoopie, I feel honored I can take an important part in this democratic process. So who’s the other person?”\n“Oh, that would be Elliot. He was one of the later arrivals, but is very personable. Not that you’d know since I doubt you’ve even seen him given that you lock yourself in you room all the time.”\n“Yeah, yeah, I know who he is, bald guy. So I take it you want Ron to win huh?”\n“Well…I’d be lying if I said I didn’t, but Elliot’s seems like a good guy too, so I’m sure he’d make a good leader as well.”\n“Why haven’t you run? I mean you seem to like to organize things.”\n“Me? Oh no, I’m not a leader.”\n“Well from what I’ve seen of Ron, he isn’t either.”\n\nNina stops you in the corridor.\n\n“Damn it, stop being an asshole! At least Ron makes an attempt to get involved in things! You haven’t done shit since you got here except insult people and lock yourself away! Like it or not we’re ALL in this together! And you better start getting with the program and contribute!”\n“What the fuck? I am contributing; I’m going to this goddamn meeting aren’t I? And you better watch your tone; remember I’M the swing vote for your boyfriend.”\n“Ron isn’t my boyfriend! I mean…not yet…uh…”\n“What? You mean he isn’t taping your ass yet? Shit, he’s stupider than I thought then, because he’d be lucky to get someone who looks like you even if you are annoying.”\n\nNina stands and stares at you in disbelief.\n\n“…could you possibly be any more vile?”\n“Probably, but we don’t have time for that, I gotta vote for some dickhead.”\n\nYou continue to the conference room (with Nina no longer walking with you) and when you finally arrive everyone is there as if they’ve been waiting for you. You don’t even really care who’s in charge since more than likely no matter who you vote for is going to be an intrusive bastard wanting everyone to do something.\n\nYou can vote for Ron. As far as leadership material, you don’t really see him as one, though he seems to have some planning skills and friendly to people so maybe he’s got the stuff.\n\nElliot you barely know anything about, he also seems to be an organizer and friendly to everyone, but not to the point that it’s irritating. Though to you there’s something a little creepy about him.\n\nAh what the hell, you know this is something Ron wants more than anything why not give it to him? Besides he’s not very “strong” which means you can probably get away with disobeying him on a regular basis without causing a big scene.\n\n“I’ll vote for Ron.” You say, Nina looks surprised and Ron jumps up and down like an idiot in celebration. You take that as your opportunity to go back to your room, Nina once again stops you in the corridor.\n\n“I just wanted to say thanks for doing this; I know you don’t even like Ron…”\n“I don’t care one way or another about him, if he wants the headache of running this place he can have it, he better just not ask too much of me, I did my bit. You can think of me as his kingmaker. See ya around.”\n\nYou go back to your room and that’s where you spend a majority of your time. You don’t really mix with anyone, and nobody really makes the attempt with you either. You’re asked to contribute to some “events” sometimes, but you always ignore such requests and nothing happens. Nina still hangs around Ron like a love sick school girl, but for god knows what reason he seems completely oblivious to the fact. And obviously she hasn’t told him how she feels about him. You watch this comical display replay itself over and over.\n\n“Yeah, GZS really picked some excellent candidates to pair up to create families for the so called future, what a joke.” You mutter to yourself.\n\nTime goes by and Ron goes about his duties which mainly consist of discussing pointless plans in the conference room. The idiot can’t do ANYTHING without talking about it with others he appointed as advisors first! If somebody’s shower is broken they have to discuss when, how and WHY it has to be fixed! Naturally everyone disagree about one point and they have to start all over again which usually means nothing gets done. A lot of planning and organizing of ideas, but no actual implementations of those same ideas.\n\nThe shelter starts falling into disrepair, a few fixes are made here and there, but they’re more jury-rigged ones more than anything. Nobody has perfectly functioning rooms from what you know…well except yours since you do nothing, but study the shelter manual all the time attempting to learn more about how it works giving you an edge in repairing your own room. (In fact you just permanently took a repair kit for yourself out of the equipment room) You really don’t understand why other people aren’t doing the same instead of waiting around for things to get repaired or complaining about needing things to get repaired. Everyone has the same damn operations manual. Read it!\n\nAbout six months go by and finally you’re given an unexpected visit during the night. You answer your door. It’s Elliot and some other people.\n\n\n“May we come in?” Elliot asks.\n“What do you want?”\n“Just to talk about the future of the shelter.”\n“Yeah? Well you can talk to Ron about that, he’s the big shelter leader.”\n“Yes he is, thanks to you. And that’s also why this shelter is in such bad shape. Ron is ruining this place with his ineptitude.”\n“Oh no, don’t blame that shit on me, that’s RON’S fault, not mine. And besides MY room works fine. If you lazy bastards would actually read the damn shelter manual you wouldn’t have any problems.”\n“Oh I’ve read the manual, I’m sure many people have. But surely you must realize most people don’t have the natural talent to fix thing that perhaps you have. Besides I’m sure you must also be aware that in a community each person has his own talents. For example Leon behind me used to be a bouncer. Don’t you think with his skills he’d make an excellent head of security around here?”\n\nLeon folds his big black arms almost daring you to say “No.” before Elliot continues.\n\n“My point is me and a few others are planning to take Ron out of office for gross incompetence. Did you know Fred and Greta are planning to have a baby? The first one to be born in here. The population in this shelter isn’t going to be stable forever. It’s going to grow and we NEED to keep this place running efficiently if we’re ALL going to survive. I know you’re a solitary person…I even respect that, but the time has come for you to choose between life or death. By joining our group, you’re choosing life. By remaining locked away in here, you’re choosing death not just for all of us, but for yourself. No man is an island.”\n\nElliot has a bit of duality to his speech. Part of him sounds genuinely concerned for the future of the shelter; he may even have a point. But the other part of him sounds like he’s politely threatening you. And you’re not sure of the whole “taking Ron out of office” thing. It almost sounds like he plans on taking over by force. You get the impression he and his little group are going to do just that regardless of whether you join or not.\n",
  "page 74": "“I don’t feel like going anywhere, you guys do what you want.” You say, but Nina insists on invading your space.\n“Hey look, I know you don’t wanna do shit, but unfortunately we’re in a real deadlock and we could really use your vote to break a tie.”\n“HEY! I told you I’m not going anywhere, now get the hell out of my room and stop invading my privacy, unless you’re looking to get invaded by me.”\n\nNina is offended by that remark and starts to hit you. It doesn’t really hurt, but it’s annoying and stings enough for you to start blocking her.\n\n“How dare you say something like that to me!”\n“Stop it! Get outta here before I throw you out, you crazy bitch!”\n\nWhile you begin to get up to avoid her slaps, your shift on the mattress causes your pistol to fall out on to the floor, Nina notices, stops hitting you and backs off.\n\n“Oh my god is that a gun?!”\n“Well, uh…yeah.” You say picking it up.\n\nNina suddenly runs off thinking her life is in danger, you soon here her yelling “Help!” and similar cries. You immediately go chasing after her, in an attempt to reassure her that you’re not some murderer.\n\nYou see her run into the conference room and follow, when you arrive, a leg trips you up as soon as you enter causing you to slam face first on the floor. Then somebody tries to take the gun away from you, its Elliot.\n\nYou feel a hefty boot kick you in ribs and knock the wind out of you, and a couple of other people start dog piling on top of you. Nina is ranting to everyone saying you tried to kill her. The fact that you came running in here with a gun, doesn’t exactly persuade them from thinking differently. Meanwhile you lose grip of the gun and Elliot takes it from you, but “accidentally” shoots you in the face with it.\n\n“Oh my god! I didn’t mean to kill him! He wouldn’t let go of it!” are the last words you hear.\n",
  "page 130": "They’ve cut off a clear escape for you to go back, so you wisely run in the direction that’s open in the opposite direction, while unleashing a burst of bullets just before your retreat.\n\nThe cannibal freaks run after you, while you attempt to figure out how to lose them, since their noises are starting to attract others.\n\nWhen you manage to get out of sight of the horde, you see an open manhole you could enter, or you could just duck into one of the ruined buildings.\n",
  "page 251": "You decide to stay, and think about what Owen said about the water supply and the anti-radiation drugs in it then you think about what happened to a majority of the survivors. It didn’t seem to do them any good, but he was right; it WAS stupid to come here! You can’t really do much about it now, but you’re hoping that water can keep you from dying a slow horrible death, though you don’t know how it works exactly since you weren’t drinking it before you absorbed rads. Still, you’ll try anything now.\n\nThe first thing you do is start drinking the water, and a lot of it. You also wonder about Owen’s supervisor Lisa. He did say she was supposed to return soon, and you form some ideas on how to handle the situation when it arises (to keep your mind occupied), but as it turns out, she never does. Probably got killed no doubt.\n\nA few days go by and there’s not much to do for entertainment purposes and you’re reluctant to leave your “safe haven” now. There are some books in what is Lisa’s room that you peruse through. You also look for maybe some notes on her research since the stuff Owen told you about did sound interesting. Maybe even ideas on what the drugs in the water supply might’ve done to people (Something ELSE you’re starting to worry about) but unfortunately you don’t find anything. She must’ve taken those with her. Owen’s room has an old TV set which amusingly has an equally as old game console hooked up to it. You spend a lot of time shooting different colored circular objects with your white triangle on the screen.\n\nAfter a week you start feeling weird. Like mildly delirious. You start lying in bed a lot, only getting up to quench your thirst since you don’t have much of an appetite.\n\nAfter a month you start feeling sick. You begin throwing up and having diarrhea even though you’ve barely been eating anything. You have the shakes and you often just lie on the floor aching all over you body. You drink the water in the steadily failing hopes that it will miraculously cure you.\n\nWhen patches of your hair start falling out, and cough up bits of blood, you really start to lose all hope.\n\n“Oh fuck…I don’t wanna die like this…shit…” you sob.\n\nYou begin thinking about suicide, but you’re so weak that the one time you seriously attempt it; you collapse on the floor when reaching for your pistol and fall unconscious for a full day.\n\nWhen you wake up, you feel a little better physically, but not much. However your mind is a little warped. As it turns out this is somewhat fortunate as you don’t worry about dying so much anymore. You do start talking to yourself at great lengths though. You begin having bizarre thoughts about things in general. Sometimes you go into a fit and start ranting until you’re hoarse.\n\nAnother month passes and you’re completely better physically, in fact you feel stronger than you ever did before. Your mind is still in la la land though. You begin to get very violent. You begin punching the walls (and even doing some damage to them) and ripping up books. What temporarily “sobers” you up is when you smash the food dispenser, breaking it completely. While you still have real food left you’ve just destroyed your only means of food-substitute when the real stuff runs out.\n\n“SHIT!” you yell. “I gotta get a fuckin…grip…I gotta get fuckin’ food!”\n\nYou grab your pistol and assault rifle and throw open the door in search of food.\n\nAfter climbing back up to the surface, you notice that you can see pretty well in the dark warehouse. It would appear you’ve developed some minor “dark vision”. In the darkness you also notice that the warehouse has lots of rats and roaches crawling around in it.\n\nThose could be food…\n",
  "page 250": "You don’t really want to stick around here any longer than you have to, so as soon as you’re rested up, you’re going to leave in the morning.\n\nYou think about what Owen said about the water supply and the anti-radiation drugs in it then you think about what happened to a majority of the survivors. It didn’t seem to do them any good, so you decide not to risk drinking any of the water or taking any with you. You also wonder about Owen’s supervisor Lisa. He did say she was supposed to return soon, you form some ideas on how to handle the situation, but as it turns out, she never does. Probably got killed no doubt.\n\nThe next morning you leave. You half expect Owen to be waiting to ambush you, but he’s completely gone. After making sure the coast is clear you get your bearings again, and make haste for leaving the City. Luckily you have no further encounters, and you’re just a little bit safer for leaving the City of course now there’s the problem of find another stretch of civilization, but you think you have enough supplies.\n\nA few days go by and you eventually do stumble upon a small town. Its more like a ghost town actually, barely anyone lives there, but that suits you just fine after having to deal with mutant cannibals.\n\nYou take residence in one of the abandoned houses, you figure it’s going to be temporary before you move on in the future, but you’re starting not to feel too well so you stick around. About a month passes and you feel tired all the time, you get the shakes pretty bad, and soon, you start vomiting blood, then there’s the hair loss…\n\nYou lie on the dirty bed in the house lamenting how ill prepared you really were for all this and the bad decisions you chose that made it worse.\n\nYou can’t go on waiting for the end, you’re in hell right now, and a quick death would be a welcome release. You get the idea to shoot yourself, but you’re so weak now that you merely collapse when you try to reach for your pistol, however as it turns out your wish is shortly granted during this time when you also fall unconsciousness and lapse into a coma.\n\nDeath soon follows.\n",
  "page 132": "Now it’s understandable that you’re not exactly thinking clearly right now with a bunch of cannibal freaks chasing you, but going into the sewers is usually NEVER a good idea!\n\nAs soon as you enter the manhole your senses are assaulted by a terrible stench that smells like something is rotting in the very radiation suit you’re wearing. You attempt to block it out of your mind and distance yourself from the manhole opening just in case some of those freaks get the idea to follow you down here. Of course it’s dark and you don’t have a flashlight so you’re at a disadvantage when the overwhelming number of mutants living down here manage to sneak up and attack you.\n\nYour first reaction is to fire at everything.\n\nYour second reaction is to struggle.\n\nYour third reaction is to scream.\n\nYour fourth reaction is to die.\n",
  "page 253": "Something you wouldn’t ever consider eating before suddenly makes a lot of sense to you. You start off by grabbing the nearest crawling roaches you see and start popping them in your mouth and chew.\n\nThey taste terrible, somehow though you don’t suffer a gag reflex though. You just find them unpleasant, like eating something bitter rather than disgusting. After having had enough of eating bugs you try to catch a rat. It takes awhile, but eventually you stomp on one severely crippling it and then stomp once more to kill it.\n\nEating a raw rat doesn’t particularly taste any better, but again you don’t suffer any sort of natural revulsion during this act. It would seem you’ve gone through a change of some sort, one that has put you in a better frame of mind for survival. One that has also put your body in better condition for survival as well since you suffer no ill effects from eating such unclean creatures under equally unclean conditions. You temporarily have some problems with lice and fleas you catch from the rats, but even that doesn’t really become a problem considering the rest hair has fallen out now. (Well you have a few wisps left)  You skin also begins to harden in time, making fleas no longer a problem. Whatever internal parasites any of these might’ve carried also have no effect as it seems your resistance and immunity system has increased quite a bit.\n\nYou look in the bathroom mirror one day and see that you’ve changed alright. Changed into something better. You aren’t going to win any beauty contests, but you’re going to live…\n\nA year passes…\n\nYou’ve been living a relatively simple life of eating and sleeping and it’s basically been enough. For the past year your mind hasn’t really been the most stable, so you haven’t really thought about anything other than your immediate survival, and given you have a water supply and the rats and roaches for food, you haven’t ventured outside of the GZS warehouse since you entered.\n\nThat’s starting to change.\n\nLately your mind seems to have a little more clarity. Indeed you’re starting to feel like “yourself” before the change. Not entirely like yourself, but you don’t go shithouse rat crazy screaming at the walls like you used to.\n\nYou’ve been getting a little curious about the rest of the City. If you’re mostly sane now, maybe other survivors are as well. Maybe even some things have been fixed; it would be nice if they were, as its getting boring where you’re currently staying. Taking your weapons with you, you leave your new home to explore. (Making sure to hide the trapdoor before leaving of course)\n\nThe City streets are still as desolate as you remember them, and mostly empty as well. You expect to run into gangs of mutants though. You suddenly stop and think about that for a moment and realize that YOU are also a mutant now!\n\nStill, that doesn’t necessarily mean mutantism is a club. You’re sure there’s a lot of fighting for resources. In fact you come across some fighting, though in a different way than you’d imagine. While you’re walking through a neighborhood by a corner store that has all its windows boarded up, you hear voices inside. You step through the open doorway to investigate. It’s dark inside, but some candles light up the place.\n\n“Ted, what do you mean you won’t gimme anything for this? This is a solid gold watch man!” a skinny mutant asks an exceptionally ugly one eyed mutant he has pistol strapped to his side.\n“Goddamn it Carl, would you fuckin’ think? What the hell am I gonna do with a gold piece of shit that doesn’t even work anymore in the first place?”\n“Well can’t you trade it for something? I mean gold’s gotta be worth something to someone! It’s not like I gave you a sack of dollar bills!”\n“Didn’t stop you from trying though did it? Look Carl, unless it’s something useful you know damn well I ain’t taking it. Bring back some batteries, a first aid kit, hell some canned corn would be a welcome change of pace than watery roach soup! Just stop bringing me shit I have no use for!”\n“But Carl! I need some bullets! You can’t expect me to do any scavenging downtown without bullets for my pistol! How will I defend myself against the Ferals or how about at night when the Shadow Horde comes out?”\n“Cry me a river Carl, you’re a fast guy I’m sure you can outrun the roving gangs of Ferals, ain’t that hard. And second of all you shouldn’t even BE out at night! If you get caught out at night I got no sympathy for what happens to you! Now…” suddenly Ted’s one good eye catches sight of you.\n\n\n“Who the fuck are you pretty boy?” Ted asks, Carl just backs off when he sees the assault rifle strapped to your back.\n\n“Pretty boy? Have you seen my face?” you retort.\n“Yeah, I see your fucking face an’ you’re a fuckin’ pretty boy as far as I’m concerned. Shit you ain’t even got any scars. So what the hell do you want, I ain’t seen you before. Ain’t seen too many here with an assault rifle either. You part of the Zeropolis Guard? Then again you don’t wear the uniform…maybe you just killed one of them then? Heh heh.”\n“Who are the Zeropolis Guard?”\n“You ain’t heard of them? Huh, well they’ve only just been making scouting missions in this area. Basically a collection of ex-National Guardsmen that insisted on staying here to the very end. They got the best hardware as far as I know, but the delusional fuckers think it’s STILL their job to keep peace in the damn City. Ain’t no peace in Zeropolis!”\n“What’s Zeropolis exactly?” you ask feeling completely out of the loop, which only gets you some mighty strange stares by Carl and Ted.\n\n“Uh, Zeropolis, y’know…The City? That’s what this place is called now.” Carl says.\n“Holy shit pretty boy, you been livin’ under a damn rock or something?”\n“Well, uh sort of…”\n“I guess so! Where the hell ARE you from?\n“Er…I never actually lived in the City...I guess you can kind of say I got trapped here and then shortly after went mad for a little while and I’m only just now starting to feel like myself.” You explain without giving too much information out.\n“Hmm, well that might explain some things. I think we all know about that madness you’re speaking of. Think it happened to everyone after this place got nuked, still going on for most people. You get that hunger craving and violent thoughts pervade your mind…though the first one I killed and ate was my wife so it wasn’t ALL bad har har har!” Ted laughs. “Hey how many people did you eat during that time?”\n“Uh, none actually.”\n“None? Ah, you must be like Carl here. He just ate roaches and rats because even when the madness hit him he still was a big pussy!”\n“Fuck you Ted! I’M the one going out risking my ass scavenging, not YOU! I…just didn’t want to eat anybody…I guess I just never suffered the madness as much as the rest.”\n“Yeah, well anyway what do you guys actually sell here?” you ask.\n“Well Carl doesn’t sell shit, because he doesn’t own this place, I do. And as you can probably tell we run on the barter system here that being the only real way to do business anymore. However I have a wide variety of items, but not obviously not right here, since this part of the store ain’t the most secure as you can see, but bring me something I might find useful and maybe we can do business; just don’t bring fuckin’ broken gold watches!” Ted exclaims looking back at Carl.\n\n“There’s a lot of stuff downtown to scavenge, hey…maybe you could come with me?” Carl suddenly asks hopefully.\n",
  "page 112": "“Alright Nina, we’ll do it your way.” You put your pistol away and take Nina back to your room for the rest of the day.\n\nTime goes by and Nina gets voted out. The position of shelter leader is eliminated and a council is formed instead. They begin to implement some changes. Nina’s idea of having people live on the surface is squashed, the idiots in charge claim that everything will be all right and only in cases of extreme punishment will people be sent to the surface. The other change is that you are to work less on the computer system.\n\nAnd so it begins, they’re trying to faze you out, so they don’t need you anymore. And if they don’t need you anymore they can kick you out of the shelter. (It looks like you are going to be the only people deemed “criminal” enough to be exiled to the surface) You saw this coming.\n\nThat’s the second time you anticipated events and did nothing, you could kick yourself.\n\nHowever there’s still the question of them trying to MAKE you leave, you are the one that owns the gun after all and not one person has ever dared to try to take it from you. You decide to start working out on a regular basis just in case.\n\n\nThat day comes soon, when a couple people attempt to wrestle it from you, fortunately you’ve been expecting that, you end up shooting them both dead. People are really starting to hate you now, threats are being made that if you and your family don’t leave, then not you, but Nina and Jack are going to suffer the consequences.\n\nYou respond with a similar threat of your own that if anything happens to either of them that you’re going on a postal shooting spree starting with everyone’s kids and won’t stop until you’re out of bullets, and then you’ll fuck up the central computer that powers everything in the shelter. Given your past, people believe you too. People stop harassing you and Nina, but they still “shun” you 99 percent of the time.\n\nIt doesn’t matter though since as more years go by there’s even less room in the shelter, and less supplies, now you’re not even charge of the computer system anymore and it’s barely being run properly by Todd and Charles. Things are starting to break down again. You’re seriously starting to think about leaving the shelter voluntarily.\n\n“Nina, let’s leave. Surely there’s gotta be something better out there. I mean staying here is like waiting to die. We gotta get out of this place.”\n“But what about Jack? I mean we’re going into unknown territory here. Things could be dangerous up there.”\n“It probably will be dangerous, but what the hell we’ve been living in an enclosed space with a bunch of people who hate us for years, and both experienced death attempts. Its not like we’re strangers to it.”\n“Well…shouldn’t we at least stay until the very end?”\n“If we stay until the very end, we might not be getting outta here because by the time everyone’s crammed in so tight with no more supplies or properly functioning equipment, everyone’s going to be panicking and rioting. No, we need to leave while the getting is good. You and Jack start packing up all your vital stuff. I’ll be loading up on some supplies that we might need. We still need to travel light, but make sure you and Jack bring as much water as you can carry.”\n\nSoon you, Nina and Jack are ready to go. Everyone’s wondering what you’re doing and then all eyes are on you when you open the elevator door. You take a moment to address the huddled masses.\n\n“Well we’re leaving now, I’m sure you’re all as glad about it as we will be. Before we leave though I’d just like to say a few things. If any of you fucktards have a lick of sense you’ll abandon this over priced coffin, and coffin is definitely an accurate term with how cramped it’s getting in here. Hell the place is even starting to smell like one, with all the shower break downs. Its like watching something slowly die…hmm I think I saw that show already, when the world got blown to shit years ago. Don’t need to see it again and the first time was more interesting anyway, so enjoy your downward spiral experience losers!”\n\nAnd with that you and your family leave the shelter.\n\nAs you look out before the wilderness in front of you, you can only hope there’s something else out there, but even if there isn’t you know you’ll make it somehow.\n\nYou and your family begin to walk…\n",
  "page 111": "“Hey Nina get up.”\n“Huh, what? Not tonight I’m tired.”\n“No it’s not that. It’s about the surface. I think we need to start taking precautions and possible steps to expand above. The surface doesn’t look that bad and…”\n\nNina immediately sits up.\n\n“YOU WENT TO THE SURFACE? After I told you not to fucking do that?! YOU ASSHOLE!”\n“Calm down look you can see nothing happened to me. It doesn’t even look like there was any bombs that landed anywhere near the area.”\n“You could be radiated! The wind blows your know or have you forgotten? Or maybe it was a biological weapon! A disease could be floating in the air! You ever think of that? You could be infected with god knows what right now and spread it to the whole shelter! And our baby!”\n\nAnother surprise.\n\n“Baby? You’re pregnant?”\n“I just found out recently from Brenda a few days ago. I was going to tell you soon, I should’ve told you yesterday before you went to the surface, but I THOUGHT you respected my wishes! I can’t believe you…”\n\nNina gets up and starts pacing. She’s very upset. You get up and try to fix this mess.\n\n“Look that just makes this idea even more vital, this place can’t support all these people having babies. Even GZS mentioned in their delusional guideline statement it was the intention for people to eventually go back up to the surface and repopulate it with their families. We can’t live like a bunch of crowded sardines; we should make preparations now, before it becomes a problem.”\n“But it might be dangerous up there.”\n“It probably won’t be a picnic, but that’s another reason why we should start getting ready now. The more we’re prepared the better off we’ll be to defend ourselves.”\n“But the radiation…”\n“Look, the fact remains this place IS going to get overpopulated one day and people are going to have to start going up to the surface and any background radiation isn’t going to disappear within that time. So we’re just going to have to roll the dice and deal with that fact. Like I said I think we’re okay, we’re in a fairly isolated area away from an important major city. It’s not like we’re located on either of the coasts which were probably bombed the shit out of. And to the response to biological weapon thing, I highly doubt those were used, we were the only country that had the capability to launch such weapons from a long distance, except maybe Russia and I’m sure they probably just used nukes on us. Besides any virus or germ used in such a way would’ve died out long ago after it killed off the immediate population.”\n\nNina still doesn’t look so sure, she still look worried about you. You hold Nina to reassure her.\n\n“If it’ll make you feel better I’ll actually go see Kyle and have him check me out. And you know how much I hate going to see doctors, especially one that’s got all his knowledge from the GZS info files. I’ll be here for a long time… for all of us.”\n\nYour words seem to relax her a bit. She smiles and embraces you more closely.\n\n“Okay, I’ll bring it up tomorrow…I still think it’s funny that you of all people would be advocating going back to the surface.”\n“Pfft! WE’RE not going to the surface to live. We’re staying here! I just want get the rest of these fuckers out of the shelter and on to the surface! This place is too damn crowded as it is!”\n“Now that sounds more like you!” Nina laughs.\n\nFive more years pass…\n\nIt’s been ten years since you got here. It almost seems surreal to think about. Nina’s still the shelter leader and you’re still looking after the central computer. However a lot more things have changed, and just as predicted the population grew significantly, fortunately the implementations ahead of time allowed everyone to adjust with little problems.\n\nThere was some apprehension at first when Nina first suggested the surface thing, but eventually people did see the point in it. Some even wanted to go up to the surface. The first step was to make a fully functioning elevator that people could go up AND down on without any problems. (Of course that job fell to you again)\n\nThe next step was to create small “huts” with the cars outside as well as using current shelter material. This went quicker than expected as most people pitched in to help.\n\nNina gave birth to a son Jack, and almost went back to her duties immediately, leaving you to do most of the “Mr. Mom” work. Nowadays you split your time between monitoring the computer and monitoring Jack. Thankfully Charles and Todd have learned a lot more now and don’t require your supervision lessening your workload.\n\nNow its time for the next step.\n\nNina and her council have been discussing plans for the even farther future. Contact with others and exploration. Within the past five years of the return to the surface, there has been contact with a few wanderers here and there, but they tended not to talk too much about their travels, they just mentioned that they’d seen other evidences of civilization, not all very civilized of course. Most of them just seemed to want to keep moving after doing a bit of trading and resupplying. One even hinted at some other “things” lurking around on the surface which didn’t sound too promising.\n\nHowever, the shelter needs to start finding a stable trading partner, or at least a place to find more supplies, because the vital ones are starting to run out. Some people are asked to volunteer for this exploration mission\n\nIt wasn’t surprising Leon volunteered, but Brenda and Todd also volunteered. They were given as much supplies as they could carry and armed with the most “dangerous” things in the shelter. Leon and Todd carry some crowbars and Brenda carries a scalpel. You wonder if that’s really going to be enough though. Chances are some people out there (Quite possibly a lot) are carrying guns on them. Todd and Brenda aren’t going to be much good in a fight anyway, and while Leon is a fighter, even he can’t stop a bullet.\n\nYou’re the only one with an “equalizer” around here. Maybe you should hand it over to them to give them a better chance. Though you really don’t want to do that, for various reasons.\n",
  "page 114": "Before they leave you approach Leon, you and he still have a bit of history over the whole Elliot thing years ago. You’re guessing he’s not one to hold a grudge though since he’s never sought any type of revenge or something. You only hope he isn’t the patient type.\n\n“Alright Leon, I know you’re the fighter of this group, and I know its most likely going to be dangerous up there, so I’m gonna do something totally out of character. I’m giving you my pistol and the two clips I have. It’s in good condition, and it’s only been fired once in ten years and I think you know when that was. Here you go.”\n\nLeon takes the gun and looks at it with silence for awhile and then speaks. You think this is the first time you’ve actually heard him speak at all!\n\n“Y’know, I never did apologize for that shit ten years ago. I dunno what the hell I was thinking following Elliot; none of us who did do. You and Nina have done a better job of keeping this place running than anyone. Anyway, this is really generous of you, but I can’t shoot worth shit, but I know someone who’s going with us who used to practice regularly before the bombs dropped. Hey Brenda! I got something for ya!”\n\nBrenda comes over and her eyes widen when Leon hands her your pistol.\n\n“Aw yeah! This is what I’m talkin’ about! I just hope I’m still a good shot; I’ve only been able to practice my aim by throwing this scalpel at a human diagram chart.”\n“Yeah well don’t practice too much with it, save your bullets for an emergency. I didn’t know you were a gun person Brenda.” You say.\n“You really need to get out of that computer room and socialize more!”\n“Shit, he barely socializes when he’s in there with me and Charles.” Todd adds.\n“But yeah I used to practice with my own when I had one. I was too afraid to try to sneak mine in here though…you know we’ve all always wondered about that, how DID you sneak this in?” Brenda asks.\n\nYou just smile.\n\n“Hey I think you guys better get going.” You say almost laughing\n\n“Oh come on! What a gyp! Alright, but we want to know when we come back!” Brenda says and then her, Leon and Todd enter the elevator wave goodbye to everyone and go up.\n \nYou and everyone else go about your usual business. Nina mentions what you did.\n\n“Wow, that was really surprising for you, you’ve practically been walking around with that thing on you for ten years.”\n“Yeah, well I can only hope I don’t need it within the time that they come back…if they come back.”\n“You just gave them an edge I’d say they’ve got more of a chance now. Don’t be so pessimistic. They’ll come back.”\n“Yeah I hope. Bring Jack by the computer room later; I know you got some sort of meeting to go to.”\n“Oh I can cancel that, it’s not vital.”\n“No its fine, bring him by. I’ve been indoctrinating him on the basics of the shelter computer. Someone’s gotta run this thing when I’m gone.”\n“Well alright then, hey don’t worry. Everything will be alright.”\n\nNina kisses you and you exchange remarks about how you love each other before you make your way back to the computer room. You know its silly to think about it, but you can’t help thinking about some worst possible scenario.\n\nYou think about those three getting captured, tortured, and killed by a large group of psychotic bandits or something and then those same scum coming here because they found out the location after torturing them. You wouldn’t have anything proper to defend your family with and the surface scum would probably have all kinds of weapons to kill everyone with. They’d start by killing everyone in immediate area of the entrance, then they’d come down in small groups with automatic weapons they undoubtedly have and start killing down here and worse…\n\n“HEY! Stop spacing!” Charles suddenly says to you.\n“Huh? Oh! Okay.” You say snapping out your horrible daydream.\n“Man, what’s wrong with you? You’ve been doing that the whole time you got here.”\n“Nothing, just a little pre-occupied.”\n\nYou still don’t really relax until Jack gets there, which allows you to think about less terrible things like teaching him about the computer system.\n\nWhen you’re finished with your duties, you go back to your room, and Nina’s there waiting for you looking as lovely as usual. You came in this place ten years ago with nothing except a bad attitude, now you got a lot more…\n\nYou’re not losing this. No way in hell.\n\nThe next day you start visiting the community gym area. You know other people like Leon use it. Nina uses it to keep in shape, but you’ve never stepped foot in the place, you never really saw any reason to, its not like you were fat or anything, but you realize if some shit goes down you’re going to have to be in better physical condition. You might not have a gun, but MAYBE you’ll be quick and strong enough to take one away from somebody! You need a fucking edge. You begin training regularly. Nina’s a little confused about this sudden change, but she’s not at all displeased with it.\n\nYou do this for the next six months with the constant theme running in your mind of how you’ll be able to take out the first miscreant that steps through the elevator, grab his gun and…\n\n“Hey everyone, they’re back! And they’re in a fuckin’ car with a shitload of stuff!” someone shouts while you’re training.\n\n\nYou immediately stop and head for the surface. When you arrive you see Leon unloading some stuff out of a beat up, but functioning car, he’s got a patch on his eye now and his face is scarred, but otherwise looks okay. Brenda comes up to you and tosses you your pistol back, along with three clips!\n\n“Came in handy, but I think I’ll be using THIS from now on!” Brenda pats an automatic rifle slung over her shoulder. “Hey, you look different, you been working out?”\n\n“Um, something like that. So where did you get all this stuff?”\n“Most of it we got from this small place called Ashtown that’s agreed to trade with us, we’d found it after about a week of wandering around, we were there negotiating with them and they wouldn’t trust us at first until the place suddenly got attack by a bunch of raiders. We helped defend the place from a one month siege! We also stuck around to help heal the wound. After that, they decided we were okay…that was at sort of a high cost though. Todd didn’t make it. He got killed in the fight. Tried to save him, but it was already too late by the time I got there.” Brenda explains.\n\n“Damn...he was an alright guy…so is this fight where Leon got all scarred up?” you say as he approaches.\n“No, that happened after we left Ashtown, we went exploring some more, we found another place a lot less friendly called The Combine. Trust me; we want to AVOID that place. We barely got out of there; we were basically prisoners. That’s why we were gone for so long. However, that’s where we got this car. We stopped back at Ashtown to pick up some supplies and came back here.” Leon answers, then he looks at you with his remaining eye. “Damn, you been working out?”\n\nYou nearly start laughing at your situation, here you were training and thinking up every possible worst case scenario that was going to befall the shelter, while Brenda and Leon were actually engaged in some worst case scenarios. You’re just glad that nothing did happen to the shelter, but you certainly feel less naked now that you have your “equalizer” back!\n\nLife in the shelter continues.\n\nTen more years pass…\n\nYou’ve been here twenty years and as always there are more changes.\n\nMore people have moved to the surface, pieces of the shelter have been dismantled and started to be used to build a real town along with supplies from Ashtown, and scavenging from other places. Still, the shelter is needed to ensure at least a clean water supply so you’re still running it. Nina’s position has changed though. Since the shelter doesn’t contain a majority of the population anymore, her position is more of a community council person and her title is no longer “shelter leader”. The place has been given a name now; New Haven\n\nOne current problem is to keep the place together, but with the younger population, they’re less likely to want to stay. Ever since Leon came back with a giant mutant wolf head on one of his exploration trips, they all want to be “explorers” too. Your son Jack being one of those young people.\n\nNina of course doesn’t want him to go anywhere (You’re reminded of when she didn’t want you to go to the surface) and you can’t say you’re too fond of the idea either, but what can you do?\n",
  "page 235": "You’re not going to be some fucking puppet, if you’re ever going to control this whole town, you’ll do it yourself, in fact you display your feelings about the Combine immediately when their little envoy unit enters your part of the town by telling your followers to shoot them on sight.\n\nOf course killing a few of their number doesn’t endear you to them, not that it was supposed to, but unfortunately one of the other town warlords decides to take advantage of the Combine visit and isn’t quite as proud as you are.\n\nAn all out battle for the town occurs again, and you’re not on the winning side as the warlord who sold out to the Combine gains more ground. You vow to do as much damage as you can though, namely by burning down most of your side of the town, killing every non-combatant living under your control there, as well as destroying the biofuel refinery and ultimately fleeing Cinderville. It all comes to a final end though when you make your last stand against Combine soldiers in your old home where you killed your first victims five years ago.\n\nAfter all the trouble you gave them back at Cinderville, the Combine soldiers don’t even attempt a long drawn out shoot out with you. They just start bombarding the place with rockets and grenades.\n\nThe entire place is razed to the ground with you in it.\n",
  "page 113": "You said nothing when you should have about the surface five years ago. That was your fault. You can do something now though. Something unpopular and drastic, but something that will better ensure the safety of your family.\n\n“Alright, I’m doing something I should’ve done a long time ago! I’M taking over!”\n“You? Says who?! What gives you the right?!” someone in the crowd shouts.\n\nYou point your pistol in his direction.\n\n“THIS! Is what gives me the fuckin’ right bitch! My willingness to allow you to continue your goddamn existence! Now here’s how things are gonna go down.”\n\nYou begin to implement new changes whether anyone likes them or not, and most folks don’t, but as usual you don’t give a shit.\n\nYou keep Nina’s plan for the surface idea, one of the things you do is install another call button so the elevator can now go up and down without all the extra hassle of fucking with the computer anymore, you still don’t know what the fuck GZS was thinking about with that idea of fucked up engineering. Parts of the shelter begin to get stripped along with some of the vehicles still remaining outside to create a few small homes.\n\nAs for who is going up to live, you devise a random numbering system that everyone has to participate in…of course you’ve purposely rigged it so your family doesn’t have to live up there. You’ve also rigged it so certain “useful” members don’t have to live up there either making them a little more receptive to your changes. Charles and some others are suddenly pleasant with you again. Naturally everyone who does have to leave hates your guts.\n\nYour next step is to send out “explorers” to go find other communities to contact and trade with, because you desperately need more supplies. You pick Leon for the task, but Todd also volunteers. Brenda wants to go too, but you need all the people with medical knowledge here in the shelter.\n\nA few weeks later Leon and Todd come back from their explorations. They mention they came across a place called Ashtown. They say it’s a small town, but willing to trade since they have routine problems with raiders and wouldn’t mind a supply of fresh water for a change.\n\nNina doesn’t exactly approve of your methods, but she goes along with you, because she loves you and you’re actually getting something accomplished.\n\nFive more years pass...\n\nThings have changed quite a bit, for better and for worse.\n\nYou’re running the shelter and its now above town called “Exile” basically by yourself and its putting you on edge each and everyday. One thing you didn’t think about when finding a trading partner, was the fact that more weapons might be coming in. You now aren’t the only person here with a gun. Which has lessened your intimidation value a bit, but you’ve countered a full blown rebellion by turning the “sheltered” and the “unsheltered” against each other. The people who live in the shelter are of course a lot more well off and healthier, while those living on the surface now suffer from the elements and the occasional mutant wolf pack attack.\n\nThe haves vs. the have nots. It’s an old tale that’s been played over and over. A tale that resulted in Armageddon, and now apparently even beyond it.\n\n\nBut even you cannot prevent an unstable powder keg from exploding forever and one day it does. Full blown rioting breaks out, you attempt to squash the rebellion, but it’s not even a rebellion so much as it is full blown anarchy as people IN the shelter are attempting to kill you in the opportunity to attempt to take over. Damn, you really thought Leon was on your side too.\n\nYou end up having to shoot your way out of the conference room, and make it back to your room where Nina is barricaded with Jake, she opens the door long enough to let you in.\n\n“We have to get out of here!” she screams. “It’s over! They’re gonna kill us!”\n",
  "page 234": "If you have any motivation to keep your position, you’ll have to ally with the Combine, for now at least. You decide to at least hear what they have to say. Two envoys come to speak to you; one of them is some rough looking man that probably thinks he’s some sort of hard ass. The other is a woman, she looks like she’s probably seen battle, but you’re more interested in her seeing your dick up close and personal if that’s possible.\n\n“So, I hear you’re one of the Warlords of this town. My name’s Roger and this is Vivica. We belong to The Combine as I’m sure you already know.”\n“Yeah, yeah, I already know all about your little paramilitary outfit. Trying to tame the\nwasteland or some shit. Futile endeavor I say. It all comes down to chaos in the end. The last world war proved that.”\n“Yeah, and I’ve ran into your type before. Typical petty despot who thrives off of the suffering around you. Let me guess, you were probably a petty criminal or prisoner in your old life. A loser. Someone who never could accomplish anything, until AFTER the bombs hit. And look at you; you can’t even do that right. You don’t even control this whole town. You’re still a loser.”\n\nYou smile at Roger’s poor attempt at psychology.\n\n“Oh, is that what I was eh? Well I guess that makes us both sides of the same coin. You were probably some boring fucktard in a boring job, with a boring life. You probably watched reality shows about cops and mercs an’ shit wishing you could do that, but were too much of a sheep to go out and have adventures of your own. You just obeyed the laws and followed the rules. Now look at you. Mr. wasteland fuckin’ warrior, but even in this new world you’re still a fucking sheep. Still following the rules, the only reason you’re having adventures now is because your superiors tell you to. You’re just as much of a fucking loser as I am.”\n\nRoger noticeably grows angry by your own psychological evaluation, but Vivica steps in to mediate.\n\n“Look, you fuckers compare dick sizes later, we ain’t got time for it right now.”\n“Ooowee! I like the mouth on this one! I’d like it more around my dick though…you interested in seeing just what my dick size exactly is honey?”\n“(Sigh) I suggest you better explain why the Combine should back you for control of this shithole town and what you’d even bring to the table other than your miniscule cock you like flapping in the wind.”\n“Why do I need to convince you? You’re the fuckers who want the damn town, but if you must know, I already have control of a biofuel refinery. I’d say that puts me as a pretty good favorite right there.”\n“Eh, not really. One would wonder why someone who has such an advantage doesn’t already HAVE control of the entire town. It seems like only someone who is really stupid or too incompetent to lead his side to ultimate victory would be the only logical explanation.”\n“Oh it’s just that simple to you huh? For your information I don’t exactly HAVE the same amount of people as the other warlords. I have enough to defend my territory and that’s about it and sure I can refuel all my vehicles easy enough, but so fuckin’ what? You think that means shit in close urban combat? Some sniper can just blast a driver riding down the street. Don’t mean shit. However! My refinery can be used to help fuel YOUR vehicles in your war with…what those cyborgs right? I mean you guys are fighting in the open battlefield where you can maneuver and drive around. You can also transport supplies quicker. And I know why you also want control of this place. You want conscripts. Well, you’ll get no protests from me; take anyone you want, except my workers at the refinery and myself of course.”\n\nVivica and Roger look at each other and discuss in quiet about what you’ve told them, Vivica speaks up again.\n\n“And you would be willing to join the Combine and supply us with whatever we need?”\n“Sure, like I said, take anyone you want except me or the people needed to run the refinery, of course I hope this isn’t a one way street, I mean I want something too…”\n“Yes, of course we will transport food and water supplies if you need…”\n“What? No not that shit. Fuck, I got my own private stash of food and water. And the rest of the shitheads in this town can fend for themselves. Nah, what I want is right here in front of me…” you say beginning to leer at Vivica. Now she begins to feel very uncomfortable. Good. You like that.\n\n\n“Hold on we have to talk this over…” Roger says.\n“WHAT?!” Vivica shouts.\n“Sure, sure, you do that. Just remember, this is my offer and I might say it’s a very generous one, I doubt you’ll get a better one. The rest of these warlords are greedy bastards, they’ll want weapons, and a bunch of other shit. All I’m asking for is for some time with a woman and your help with getting rid of the other warlords of course. After I gain control of the entire town, you’ll be able to take whatever you want with no resistance. You want fuel? You got it. You want cannon fodder? You got that too. Decline my offer and well…let’s just say I’ll make sure I do a lot of damage before you fine Combine folks bring me down. I’ll leave you to it to decide.”\n\nVivica and Roger leave your office and you can hear arguing outside. Obviously Vivica is NOT real keen on this compromise and she’s even less keen when it’s decided she needs to “take one for the team”.\n\nYou fucking love this shit. How far people are willing to degrade themselves for the “greater good”. What a fucking joke.\n\nLater that night, you and Vivica are ready to finalize the “deal”, though she’s still trying to maintain some semblance of dignity.\n\n“Don’t think you’re gonna be pulling some kinda sick shit with me or hitting me either, because if that happens, I won’t give a fuck about the deal, the Combine, or even if I live, but regardless of what happens, you’ll be singing soprano, and pissing like a bitch for the rest of your life.”\n\nA threat without fear of consequence. Somehow you can respect that. Hell you think you might even be in love.\n\n“Okay, calm down sweetheart, none of that’s gonna happen. Now let’s start off by getting that pretty mouth of yours in action like I mentioned earlier today…”\n\nAfterwards, Vivica grabs her clothes and leaves immediately. You’re a little disappointed, since you almost got the impression she enjoyed herself…oh well, back to business.\n\nWith the Combine’s help, wiping out the other warlords is a snap. Indeed you could’ve done it yourself long ago if you’d had disciplined people and more of them. Of course none of that matters now, you’re officially head of the town, though the Combine leave a few troops behind as a reminder that Cinderville is now part of it. They don’t do too much though, and mostly leave you to your own devices. You’re giving them free fuel, free conscripts, and even letting them use most of your remaining vehicles, and barely asking for anything in return, why shouldn’t they let you do what you want? They’re doing what they want. Besides they’re busy at war with a bunch of cyborgs and you’re so far away. They won’t be interfering anytime soon.\n\nFive years pass…\n\nTen years have passed since the bombs dropped and civilization seems to be reforming…unfortunately.\n\nThe Combine won the war with the Cybernetic Evolution a couple years ago and have had time to focus on their current holdings a lot more. This means they’re focusing more on Cinderville, which you don’t like. In fact more and more of a Combine influence is being felt. They’re starting to supply the town regardless of what you said before. No longer are the people living in poverty and near starvation. By God, they’re even trying to REBUILD parts of it! You don’t like this.\n\nYou protest their meddling, but they don’t pay any attention to you, Cinderville IS under Combine control after all. You’re just there for looks and in fact you’re not looking too good to them anymore. It seems the Combine wants to put one of their own in power here to run things. They don’t need to compromise their ideology anymore now that the war’s over. They don’t need to associate with scum like you anymore now.\n\nThings are truly coming to an end…\n",
  "page 116": "“Nina, we’re getting in the shelter NOW!” you grab her hand and run to the shelter entrance, upon seeing this others begin to follow your lead as the motorcycle rumble gets closer.\n\nYou Nina and Jack get in the elevator first, and everyone else starts to crowd inside unfortunately everyone is shoving and pushing to get in, but there simply isn’t enough room not allowing the door to close.\n\n“GET OUT! THE ELEVATOR CAN’T CLOSE!” You yell.\n“FUCK YOU! YOU GET OUT!” someone shouts back.\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures…\n\nYou pull your gun out and start shooting in the ceiling of the elevator, causing folks to run out.\n“GET OUT! THIS IS OUR RIDE!” you shout and push the door button, taking one last look of the frightened crowd as the doors close.\n\nOn the way down Nina holds on to Jack trying calm him down. She looks at you with silent disbelief. She can’t believe you actually sacrificed all those people just like that, the men, the women, and the children.\n\n“Don’t look at me like that Nina! I did what I did to save us! This is fuckin’ survival Nina! You know that!” you retort.\n\nWhen the elevator reaches the bottom, Nina runs back to your room with Jack and you quickly get something to jam the door open, so the elevator can’t go back up again. You see Charles come out from the computer room. He must’ve been the only one down here to keep an eye on the computer.\n\n“What’s going on? Why are you blocking the elevator door?”\n“We’re under fucking attack and I can’t let those fuckers come down here!”\n“But what about everyone else?! You can’t just leave them up there! You’re the only one with a proper weapon!”\n“Hey that’s tough! I mean I’m sorry all those people are in deep shit right now, but that ain’t my concern, my family is MY concern!”\n“You heartless bastard! What about all the other families you left to probably die up there?! I always knew you weren’t fond of people, but I never thought you’d go to this extent! Well if you’re not gonna do anything I will! Get outta my way, I’m going up!”\n\nYou shove Charles back hard.\n\n“What the fuck are you gonna do Charles? You ain’t a fuckin’ hero! This ain’t like those old movies you watch! You’re a fat outta shape fuck, you wouldn’t stand a chance! Shit you don’t even have a weapon!”\n“Well gimme yours then!” Charles says trying to take your pistol. You push Charles back even harder, when that doesn’t work, you hit him with face with the butt of the gun causing him to fall back.\n“Don’t even fuck around like that Charles.” You warn pointing the pistol at him.\n\nHe doesn’t seem to understand you’re being deadly serious here; he makes another attempt by charging at you. You shoot him three times before he falls dead at your feet.\n\nNina comes running from your room to see what’s happened now, she’s horrified. Your actions within the past few minutes have severely changed her view about you.\n\n“He was trying to go to the surface! I can’t allow that, we have to remain down here where it’s safe! Who knows how long those fuckers will stay around! I’m trying to protect all of us!” you shout.\n\nDays pass and things are strained between you and Nina. She doesn’t approve at all of what you did. A lot of those people she was friends with. She says you did it purposely just so you could get more of your precious solitude and while that isn’t true, you can’t help but feel things are a lot better without anybody else around…\n\nA year passes since the invasion, you used to keep an eye on the elevator door on a regular basis, but lately you haven’t bothered. Nina has been distant with you ever since that day. Sometimes you’re all right with each other, but more often than not you argue. If it wasn’t for Jack, the both of you would probably just stay on opposite sides of the shelter.\n\nOne day you wake up and look for the both of them, but you can’t find them anywhere then it suddenly occurs to you where they’ve gone. To the surface. You immediately press the call button and shut “Come on! Come on!” at the elevator’s slow descent. You do the same thing when you’re going up.\n\nYou rush outside wondering where the hell Nina thinks she was off to, considering there’s no knowledge of any beacons of civilization nearby. You figure she couldn’t have gotten far and you’re right, she’s surveying the remains of the invasion. Everything that was built on the surface was destroyed, and it looks like nobody was spared. You see skeletal remains littered everywhere. She’s crying while holding on to Jack and then speaks when she sees you.\n\n“See what you did!”\n“Hey I didn’t do THIS! The wasteland scum did this! What the hell Nina? I only have so many bullets, and I didn’t even have my spare clips with me at the time! I couldn’t shoot them all!”\n“Oh, but you could shoot Charles right?”\n“Now that was…”\n“Or how about Elliot? Remember when you shot him and claimed it was self-defense?”\n“That WAS Self-defense! Nina, you’re acting like a stupid bit…” you stop yourself from completing that sentence, calm yourself and then continue. “Look, I did what I did to protect us, I didn’t want any of us getting killed. Let’s all just go back inside the shelter and…”\n“Get your hands off of me! I’m not going back in there with YOU! I can’t stand to look at you anymore, even if it is a rarity nowadays!”\n“So whadda ya gonna do Nina? Take Jack traipsing across the fuckin’ wasteland and hope you don’t get raped and killed before you die of dehydration? In case you haven’t noticed, but this is IT! There probably ain’t another place like this for miles! And if there is, I bet it damn near isn’t as comfortable OR friendly! Look Jack needs the both of us here and…”\n“Jack doesn’t need YOU! You’re barely spend time with him anyway! I can’t do it anymore I can’t spend one more day in that shelter with you after seeing what you did a year ago!”\n“NINA SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK IN THE GODDAMN SHELTER NOW!”\n\nNow Jack begins to cry, and Nina attempts to make him stop, and now you see this situation isn’t going to go away even if you dragged them both into the shelter kicking and screaming. Yet despite all this, you can’t let Nina and Jack leave, you do the only other solution.\n\n“Oh fuck it. Here.” You pull out your pistol and shove it into Nina’s hand. She doesn’t accept it at first until you force her take the thing. After she finally holds it, you start to leave. Nina calls out.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n“Oh now you show concern? I’m leaving Nina, you said you can’t live here with me since I now repulse you so much, so I’m doing what’s best and fuckin’ leaving, because whether you believe it or not I do what’s best for this family. I’ll leave and probably die somewhere out in the wilderness or if you still have any kind of feelings for me, you’ll save me a lingering death and just shoot me now. Either way, I’m gone. Jack, take good care of your Mom, she gets a bit high strung at times. The computer’s easy to run, just read the damn manual. That’s what I always told everyone else. Both of you have a nice life.”\n\nYou turn and begin to walk, you start wondering how long you’re going to last without any kind of supplies, you didn’t even bring a canteen with you. What does it all matter now anyway? Fuck it right?\n\nYou turn your head and see Nina and Jack just entering the shelter entrance. You shake your head, wondering where you went wrong. Where all the love went so damn quickly. Maybe she was right in some ways, maybe you were too ruthless. You just wanted to save them so badly though, you didn’t want to lose them. Of course you did anyway.\n\nYou turn your head again, now you just see Nina. What the hell is she doing now? You hope to god she didn’t have some change of mind suddenly. Because you know what’s going to happen, she’ll ask you to come back, and like an idiot you probably will, and then things will be semi-okay and then they’ll get worse again and you’ll be back to this again. At this point you don’t feel like putting up with the shit anymore either. Just let it go Nina, just let it the fuck go. You made your decision now stick fuckin’ by it.\n\nOnce more you turn your head; she’s walking briskly towards you…with your pistol in her hand. She has an unemotional look on her face. Reminds you of when she was going to throw Ron and his boy toy into exile that one time. You always knew she had a darker side to her, looks like its coming out one last time.\n\nYou slow down your walking so she can catch up to you quicker, until finally you stop altogether. You don’t turn you head anymore; you want to make this easy on her.\n\nNow you feel the metal barrel to your head. Your last thought on this burned out world are:\n\n“She did still care.”\n",
  "page 237": "You “resign” your position and leave Cinderville. Not knowing where to go, you go back to your second home outside Cinderville. You try to live a quiet isolated life like before, but you can’t do it now, your urge to control, to kill, and create anarchy is too strong now.\n\nYou can’t go back, so you try to go back to your past activities by visiting Cinderville every now and then to commit a few murders in the night, however being under direct Combine control now, things like that are investigated a little more now, especially when the body count starts piling up.\n\nIt’s during one of your nightly visits, that you’re captured and delivered quick and efficient justice by Combine troops.\n",

It’s a community event; nearly everyone is on the surface today. That’s when you hear the sound of motorcycles. You look in the direction of the sound and see several approaching. The riders don’t look like social types either. Everyone else on the surface begins to look too, and wondering what they should do. Nina quickly gathers up Jack.\n",
  "page 117": "No way in hell you’re going to hide, you’re a good shot, (At least you used to be, you haven’t practiced in awhile) you figure you can get enough of them, while taking cover and everyone else here doesn’t have to be defenseless.\n\n“Everyone grab some sort of weapon! Mothers grab your children and run to the shelter, when you get to the bottom jam the door open so it can’t come back up!” before she can even say anything you turn to Nina, “Nina! No arguments! Just do it!” you then kiss her before she does what you say.\n\nThe bikes are getting closer. There’s at least ten, each with a driver and a partner riding in the back. There’s some sort of bloody head on the front of the first bike...its Leon’s.\n\nYou can only guess the fate of Brenda and Todd were similar. Then you hear one of them yelling.\n\n\n“YEEEHAAA! THERE IT IS! JUST LIKE THAT BITCH WE RAPED AND KILLED SAID! ATTACK!”\n\nYou fire a couple times hitting a driver, the bike and its riders go flying into a couple other bikes. Not bad, in fact better than you expected. Unfortunately they’re shooting at you now too. You duck for cover while everyone else does likewise, some getting shot in the process.\n\nThe remaining bikers attempt to circle around and open fire, but now everyone has adequate cover, so most of the bikers in the “bitch seat” get off to be a little more thorough.\n\nThe shelter people and the bikers clash. Not all the bikers have guns, but they’ve been surviving on the road long enough to be better fighters. Many of your people are going down, and you’re the only one who seems to be able to do any damage to these invaders. You manage to blast three more in the chest.\n\nSoon you’re out of ammo, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. Some monster motherfucker starts attacking you with a spiked bat, landing it right in your leg. You punch him out before collapsing in pain. You attempt to pull the bat out, but then you’re kicked in the face and thrown into the path of a speeding motorcycle which rides over your arm. You’re not going anywhere; in fact the only thing that saves you from a follow up death blow is the fact that Nina and all the mothers come back up to the surface with weapons to help defend against the attack. Nina grabs your pistol which you dropped and loads it up with a clip you left down in the shelter and blasts the giant biker’s brains out.\n\nSeeing many of there comrades dead and reinforcements arrive on your side, the remaining bikers sound a retreat and ride off. Much has been lost this day though; the shelter’s population has severely been decimated, not to mention the confidence in staying on the surface.\n\nAfter this event, all ideas of rebuilding on the surface are abandoned. The shelter has more than enough supplies and room now for everyone considering this last attack. Of course that problem is only going to pop up again in the future when the population replenishes itself again. Maybe not in your lifetime, but certainly in Jack’s. He can’t stay here, he’s going to have to go out in the world and learn how to deal with it. And you make sure he’s better prepared than you were.\n\nYou stop Jake’s training in learning about the computer system; it won’t do him any good. Instead you make him do physical training in the shelter gym. You’ve never used the thing, but he’s sure going to. You can’t directly train with Jake since you’re basically crippled in one leg and arm, but you can motivate and that’s what you do. Nina doesn’t exactly like it, but she sees that one day the shelter is going to need someone to get more supplies.\n\nAs years pass you eventually start succumbing to your damaged body’s inability to continue this life. Jack is now a young man, the shelter’s population is starting to grow again, and the shelter’s supplies are running low. You say your goodbyes to Nina, telling her you love her and ask to see Jack as you lie in your bed.\n\n“Jack, you’re going to have to leave this place soon one day. Whether you decide to leave permanently or you decide to come back with supplies to keep this place going, is up to you. But you are going to have to leave it. You understand?”\n“Yes Dad.”\n“(Cough) Good, now here. Even though you’re a tough guy who knows how to defend himself, you’ll still be needing this when you go out there. Wish you could practice with it, but it only has one clip left and you’ll be needing all the bullets you can get.”\n“Well I did practice my aim by throwing some scalpels at a human diagram, if that’s any help.”\n“Couldn’t hurt. Glad to see you’re inventive, you’ll need that up there. Okay, I think that’s it…I hope I taught you enough.”\n“You did Dad.”\n“Good. Now leave me, I ache all over and I need to rest.”\n\nJack leaves you where you have your last moments of solitude before leaving this mortal coil.\n",
  "page 238": "You can’t really say you didn’t see this coming entirely, The Combine may try hide beneath the guise of being some organization out to rebuild civilization, but at the core it’s just another dictatorship in development. You’ve seen the hypocrisy first hand of how they deal with those like you when it suits their purpose, and then dispose of them, when it doesn’t.\n\nHowever, none of this really matters, the fact remains you can’t stay here at least not in the way you’d want to anyway. You “resign” your position and return back to your second home outside Cinderville where you gather some supplies for your travels and get in your van (which has long been upgraded to function on a more reliable basis now) and decide to live life as a wandering bandit, but not without first sabotaging the biofuel refinery in Cinderville. A sabotage that results in the  refinery not only blowing up and killing folks, but also spraying shit all over most of the town.\n\n“HA HA! HAVE A NICE LIFE SHITHEADS!” you’re heard saying before driving off.\n\nMonths go by and you eventually become enemy number one by The Combine for your criminal activity of destroying caravans, murdering citizens, and creating mayhem whenever you can. Sometimes you work alone, sometimes you manage to form a gang for raids, but in all cases your goal is to cause as much misery as you’re able. You’re determined to prove that the concept of order is doomed to failure as it always has.\n\nEventually along with Combine soldiers, freelance bounty hunters are set upon you. You remain free however, always one step ahead…\n\nOne day driving along an old unused road, you see a strange man standing along side it. He doesn’t look quite human, you’ve heard stories of mutants, (and certainly seen mutated animals) but you’ve also heard most of them stay in the City where they were created by the radioactivity there. Of course there’s always a few that wander away. Looks like this one has, in fact he looks like he has with a purpose, he pulls a gun on you as your van barrels down the road, in his other hand is a piece of paper, probably a wanted poster of you. It looks like this mutie is being dramatic, but you don’t know… there’s something really creepy about him. He looks like death personified with the way he’s just waiting for you.\n",
  "page 88": "“You know what Nina? I’m in a charitable mood. What do you need?”\n“We need you to hack into the central GZS computer system to bring the elevator down.”\n“Wow, I didn’t expect that one. What’s going on?”\n“Can you do it?” Nina asks without answering your question.\n“Well in theory I might. I’ve fucked around with that computer when nobody was around in the past, but I’ve never really gotten into the inner workings of the system, and I’ve read as much as I can about the shelter itself. Damn thing’s touchy though. I just worry that if I do the wrong thing I’ll end up shutting the whole shelter down and doom us all.”\n“You mean doom yourself.”\n“Well that too, but you still never told me what you want to bring the elevator down for.”\n“Are you gonna do it or not?”\n“Okay, what happens if I don’t?”\n“I’ll just get one of my own people to attempt it and hope they don’t doom us all accidentally.”\n“(Sigh) Well played Nina, you know I’m gonna do it now. Alright, let’s go.”\n\nYou and Nina enter the Community Shelter computer room, where a couple of Nina’s tech’s are tinkering with the Central GZS computer.\n\n“What are you doing!? Give me that!” you yell taking a screw driver away from one of them. You recognize them both Todd and Charles if you remember correctly.\n“Oh man, its you! Okay, don’t get mad!” Todd says backing off. Charles does like wise.\n“Sheesh, I’m not going to shoot you! I’m just trying to prevent you from fucking up what’s basically our life support system! Its barely working right as it is! I swear GZS put us in a death trap down here.”\n“Alright then do you need any help? Or should we leave you alone while you do this?” Nina asks.\n“What do you think fearless leader?”\n“Right. Come on let’s go.”\n\nNina and the other two leave and you get to work. You first do a system scan to what’s going on exactly. Wow, this place really is in some bad shape! You can see where some fixes have been made, but without a really skilled technician routinely checking in on stuff, things are never going to get better in this place, you shutter to think what would’ve happened with Ron still in control. This place might’ve very well lost all power. You’re sort of glad you’ve begun to take an interest. MAYBE after you manage to get the elevator down you might just volunteer to upkeep this thing.\n\nYou start delving into the inner working of the system; GZS really didn’t want folks bringing the elevator down! You accidentally cut some lighting temporarily which causes you to hear some yelling from a distance.\n\n“Oh toughen up.” You say to yourself.\n\nYou continue to work and eventually you successfully override the safety protocol for the elevator and it starts its decent.\n\n“Ha ha, I rule.” You say as you come out of the computer room.\n“Did you do it?” Nina asks.\n“Sure did. NOW are you going to tell me why we’re bringing it down?”\n“You’ll see for yourself. Leon, bring both of the perverts out, this has been a long time coming…”\n\nYou notice that everyone’s standing around right now, like some special event is going down. Leon eventually comes back with Ron and William in tow, and he looks like he roughed them up first so they’d struggle less.\n\nThe elevator door opens up for the first time.\n\n“Put both of these…criminals in the elevator Leon.” Nina says. Leon does so, with a lot of protesting and pleading from both, but another couple punches shut them up. Now you know why Nina wanted you to bring the elevator down…exile. If this was a year ago and they were throwing Ron out in the wasteland for his bungling of shelter management, you’d probably be the first to applaud. But what’s going on right now is for the wrong damn reasons, and you know Nina’s just being a petty bitch who’s still harboring resentment for shit she really brought on herself with completely clueless judgment on her part.\n\n“Alright, Nina I know you’re fucking upset because your make believe boyfriend turned out to be a fag, but that was a goddamn year ago…”\n“Shut up! This has nothing to do with that! This is about justice! These two are in violation of GZS guidelines carrying on with…”\n“Oh will you shut up about that shit? I’m starting to believe the entire GZS Corporation were a bunch of fucking loonies with too much time on their hands! They build these fucking shelters that break down all the goddamn time, with no way to get back to the surface and trapping everyone down here.”\n“Why the hell are you defending these two? You’ve never been one to give a fucking shit before! You know I’ve never seen you pursue any women around here even if you were slightly appealing enough for any of them to have you. What are you gay too?”\n“(Sigh) No, Nina because if I was I’m sure you would’ve been the first one to want to spread your legs for me. Look I’m just saying this ain’t fucking right okay?”\n“Oh and YOU’RE the fucking expert on what’s right? You fucking KILLED a man! You fucking snuck a gun in here a shot somebody! So is the gun an extension of your manhood and you just couldn’t live without it?”\n“Y’know Nina, you seem awfully pre-occupied with my sexual habits. Shit, if you want me to fuck you already just come out and say it and stop beating around bush. I’d say that’s what you’ve been needing since you got in here anyway, because I haven’t seen YOU with anyone either, that didn’t turn out to be a complete fucking homo of course.”\n\nYour remark is met with a long period of silence. The rest of the shelter population has been in absolute awe, this is probably the most exciting thing that’s happened since you shot Elliot. Nina looks at you hard and recomposes herself.\n\n“Are you going to send the elevator up, or not?”\n",
  "page 89": "“Its served me well so far, so I guess asshole it is.”\n“Yeah, I thought as much. Thanks for nothing.” Nina says and walks off.\n\nYou go back to what you were doing. About an hour passes and then your lighting starts to dim, and then goes out altogether. Its pitch dark and you can hear yelling and screaming all throughout the shelter. Someone fucked something up, but good.\n\nYou leave your room and stumble through the darkness bumping into frightened people until you manage to find your way back to the computer room. You see some flashlights shining at various parts of the computer.\n\n“What the hell did you idiots do?” you yell, as two technicians shine their lights towards you.\n“Whoa! It’s you! Don’t shoot!”\n\nNina then shines her light at you as well.\n\n“Now you decide to help?”\n“Get outta the way, before I shoot all of you!” you exclaim pushing the two techs out of the way and grabbing one of their flashlights.\n\nYou inspect what happened and it’s not good, they completely fried the CPU. You don’t know how the fuck they did that, but they did. You can’t fix this, even if you had the right tools and adequate lighting. Somehow you really aren’t hysterical about all this.\n\n“Well guys, I got some really bad news. We’re in deep shit that I can’t get us out of. You’ve doomed us all. Nice going guys.”\n\nThe two techs begin to freak out and run screaming; Nina has a quiver in her voice.\n\n“You mean, there’s nothing at all?! We’re all gonna die?”\n“Looks like. The question is how, quick or slow…and I got this gun here as you all know…you coming with me?”\n\nNina doesn’t even hesitate.\n\n“Let’s do it.”\n“You sure?”\n“Just shut up and do it.”\n“Okay, now I gotta get close since its dark…”\n\nYou point the gun directly at Nina’s head and pull the trigger. You feel a splash of blood on your face and the slumping of a lifeless body.\n\nYou hear the screams echo throughout the shelter get louder. You’ll be glad to leave this insane asylum, you just wonder if you should’ve done things differently…\n\nNo time for that now. No time for regrets, just time to do it.\n\nYou pull the gun at your head and pull the trigger.\n",
  "page 82": "Once again you decide the risk is too high and you’d get caught before you could get it accomplished. You also don’t think you can trust Elliot’s monsters to do anything to help you.\n\nThe time to have acted against Elliot would’ve been long ago, this is your life now and you’re stuck. And you also realize you can’t go on waiting for the other shoe to drop. Elliot’s finally gotten around to his plan of getting rid of you, you aren’t blind. He’s sending his kids for you to teach, so that one day they’ll replace you. Then at best he’ll allow you to live as a eunuch like most of the other guys here, or he’ll just kill you and as far as you’re concerned that’s the ONLY choice he’s going to have.\n\nAnd if you kill him, you know you’d die soon after and someone else would just take his place. You ponder the idea of killing his children, since he seems to be a bit enthusiastic about continuing his bloodline, but you know he’d just have more and you don’t think you could kill a child, at least not directly....then it suddenly occurs to you what you can do. Something you can do to shut down the whole show.\n\n“Sonofabitch! Why didn’t I think of that before?!” you say out loud.\n“Ohhh! You said a bad word!” one of the children shouts, causing you look over at them all.\n\n“You bet your ass I did! Hey kids do you find this boring?”\n“Yeah.” They all say in unison.\n“Would you like to never have to do it ever again?”\n“Yeah!”\n“Would you all like to see a neat trick instead?”\n“YEAH!”\n“Okay! Brace yourselves!”\n\nYou whip out your pistol and start blasting the central computer, causing it to spark, shutter, and all other kinds of bad things before it shuts down completely taking all the shelter’s power with it. All the children scream and run off while you’re doing it. Screaming yelling by other shelter members in the distance soon follows, you can hear footsteps running towards your position, everyone’s probably wondering what’s going on. You take a mental count of how many bullets you used up.\n\n“Let’s see…oh good, I got one left.”\n\nYou point the gun at your head and pull the trigger.\n",
  "page 81": "Fuck it, whether this plan works or not, you don’t care, all you know is you can’t stay here anymore. One thing that’s working in your favor right now is the fact that Elliot and everyone else is in the conference room (Which he turned into a “meditation room” where he’s preaching some sort of weird philosophy to everyone.) You need to be quick though. You press a few buttons to make the elevator begin its decent. You only need one kid to help you in this task, so you get the one who is the best behaved and does more or less what you say. You get Jane.\n\n“Jane I need you to come with me. As for the rest of you, go ahead and access the game database and play with whatever, just don’t touch anything on the central computer!”\n\nThe kids gleefully start following your instructions while you and Jane leave.\n\n“Where are we going?” Jane asks innocently, while walking beside you.\n“I need to check on something back in my room, the central computer says something broke down, but I need to see if it actually did, or if it’s a glitch in the monitoring system. Now if something did, I’ll need to get in there and open up the paneling and do some re-wiring. Could be dangerous, so I need you to run to the medical room and grab a first aid kit just in case. Nobody should be in there right now, so just take it.”\n“I dunno, Daddy doesn’t like people taking things from there without permission…”\n“Its okay, this is for the good of the shelter.”\n\nUpon hearing that mantra, Jane seems to be more receptive to follow your orders. You tell her to wait by the elevator door when she gets the med kit. You rush to your room, load up on water and leave hoping that nobody has wandered by. You see Jane holding the med kit and looking in wonder at the elevator door which has opened up. Good its here and everything’s going according to plan. Now for the final stage.\n\n \n“Hey! This door opened up! Daddy said it shouldn’t ever open up. He says he doesn’t want anyone to leave.”\n“I’ll bet.” You mumble before addressing Jane properly. “Yeah, I know he wants to keep us all safe. Nothing was broken in my room, but I think something screwy is going on with the shelter’s systems and I need your help to fix it because I think you’re the only one talented enough to do it.”\n“Yay!” Jane says in pride.\n“Glad to see you’re excited, because this is REALLY important. You have to follow my instructions to the letter. You think you can do that?”\n“I think so.”\n“Okay, back in the computer room on the central computer on the right side you’ll see a green button flashing. Press that one. Then when the screen asks for confirmation, click on yes and press the enter button. You got all that? Repeat it.”\n“Go back to the computer room, go to the big central computer, and uh…look on the right side for a green flashing button. Press that button, then the screen will ask me a question and then I click on yes.”\n“Excellent, now after you do that, you might get a screen telling you the status of the elevator, telling you its going back up. That’s what we want it to do. We don’t want anyone leaving right?”\n“Right!”\n“Okay, I’m going to stay here and make sure this elevator doesn’t come down anymore, I need to open up some panels and do some re-wiring, so I’ll be taking that first aid kit now.”\n\nYou take the kit from Jane and tell her to go back to the computer room and do what you told her and to continue monitoring the elevator status just to make sure it goes back up and stays there. When she’s out of sight you quickly enter the elevator, and soon the door closes and you’re on your way up.\n\nYou are nervous as the elevator ascends, you half expect it to either start coming back down, or worse just stop suddenly mid way through trapping you.\n\nNone of that happens though and as soon as that door opens up again, you run out into the foyer you entered ten years ago and past that into the outside world again. \n\nYou see a bright light. It’s the sun; you forgot how bright it could be. You never thought you of all people would be glad to see it again. You see everyone’s cars still parked here, well almost. You can tell that few of them must’ve been taken at one time; a lot have just been plain vandalized. Your van still looks the same though, nobody in their right mind would steal that thing, and it already looks vandalized. You wonder if it would still start, but you left your keys to it in the shelter. You doubt if it would though.\n\n“Meh, I need the exercise anyway.”\n\nYou cover your eyes and take a far view of your position. Nobody around, there’s not even a sound except the wind; you’re all alone as far as you can tell and this is what you missed. Once again you have peaceful solitude. You don’t know if you’ll make it out here, but anything’s better than staying in the shelter.\n\nYou begin to walk…\n",
  "page 86": "If you shoot him, everyone’s going to think you’re a murderer, so you let him go. Besides if he planning on taking over by force like he seems to be wanting to do, he’ll show his true colors soon enough. You just have to watch your back until that time. In fact it occurs to you that you should just go tell Ron and Nina about this incident, sure they might not believe you, but it’s better than saying nothing.\n\nThe next day when you wake up, you hear a lot of commotion going outside your door.\n\n“See?! I told you! He’s the one who did it! He dropped the bloody scalpel right in front of his door!” you hear someone say, sounds like Elliot.\n\nYou grab your gun and open up the door to a crowd of frightened onlookers. Elliot is in front of them speaking and then turns around when you come out.\n\n“SO! The murderer finally shows his face! We both know what you did last night! I saw you! I saw you break into Ron’s room and kill him and his friend William! Then when you saw me see you, you threatened me with a gun you snuck in telling me I better keep my mouth shut or you’d kill me too! But I couldn’t stay silent! I don’t care if you do kill me! I had to warn these good people that they’re living with a psychopath!”\n\nElliot’s already gone through with his plan. He had to speed it up since you were a risk to tell everyone about it, but now he’s turned it to his advantage by blaming you for everything.\n\n“WHAT?! Elliot you’re full of shit! YOU came to my room last night trying to get me in your little rebel gang! You’re the one trying to take over, not me!”\n“LIAR! Who’re you gonna believe? Me? Who’s been nothing, but supportive of Ron, even when his plans weren’t exactly efficient? Or HIM? Someone who’s done nothing to help anyone, and has shown utter dislike for Ron and everyone else here?”\n“It’s true! (Sob) He has always hated Ron!” Nina cries from the crowd.\n\nYou attempt to explain, protest and argue the situation, but its no good, Elliot is a master speaker, manipulator, and everyone likes him and can barely tolerate you. Feeling yourself threatened you start pointing your gun at the crowd, but even that doesn’t do any good, Elliot whips them all into a frenzy to attack you, claiming how you can’t kill all of you, of course that doesn’t stop you from killing some of them (Elliot being the first of course).\n\n \nSoon you’re mobbed and the gun is taken away from you where upon someone dispenses vigilante justice and caps you in the head with it.\n",

He looks down in disbelief and then slumps down on the floor by your feet. You then get up from the floor as everyone else runs out of the room.\n\n“Yeah that’s what I thought! So much for your fearless leader!”\n\nAs you drag Elliot’s body out of your room, everyone else in the shelter has come out of their own rooms after hearing the gun shot and screaming.\n\n“OH MY GOD! HE’S GOT A GUN!” someone shouts.\n“HE’S KILLED ELLIOT!” another screams.\n\nEveryone is very afraid of what you’re going to do next. Only Nina dares approach you.\n\n“You…you killed him? I always knew you were anti-social, but…oh my god…”\n“Yeah I fuckin’ killed Elliot! And YOU of all people oughta be damn well glad I did! He was planning on taking over this place from your boyfriend Ron!”\n“Ron’s not my boyfriend! And I don’t believe you! Elliot was gracious in his defeat! He was a good man unlike you!”\n“Yeah he was so good he tried to recruit me for his little rebellion gang, and don’t try to hide in the fuckin’ crowd Leon and act like you weren’t there! All of you fuckers hiding right now, came to my room with Elliot! And lemme ask you this, WHY the hell would ANY of them come to MY room? Everyone knows I don’t invite people!”\n“I dunno what to say right now…please just put down the gun…I don’t want you to kill anyone else…”\n“For fuck’s sake Nina I’m not a mass murderer! It was self-defense! He was gonna kill me, just like he was gonna kill Ron and shit maybe he should’ve, the fuckstick’s supposed to be the shelter leader and he’s not even here for this! Where is Ron?”\n\nNina suddenly wonders where he’s at as well, she runs over to his door which is still shut.\n\n“Don’t tell me, he’s THAT much of deep sleeper.” You mutter while standing by Elliot’s dead body.\n\nNina doesn’t even knock, apparently she’s got her own key to get in his room. You’re STILL wondering why nothing has happened between those two yet, your questions are soon answered, and everyone is in for another surprise this eventful night.\n\n“EEEEEEEEEEEK! NO!” you hear Nina scream when she goes inside the room and then runs back out crying. Ron steps out in his underwear.\n\n“No, wait! Nina, its not what it looks like!” he shouts to her and then another guy in his underwear comes out. You think his name is William, you never knew too much about him before, but you know MORE than you wanted to now!\n\n“Get back inside William!” when Ron sees that there’s a whole crowd of people staring in various states of shock. It’s too late though now, everyone knows.\n\n“Wow Nina sure is a good judge of character, she thought Elliot was a good man and she thought you were straight. Looks like I wasn’t the only one with a secret in this shelter! Heh heh.”\n\nRon finally turns to you and sees what you’ve done.\n\n“…You got a gun? YOU FUCKIN’ KILLED ELLIOT?”\n“(Sigh) Not this again! Yeah I fuckin’ killed him. He tried to kill me and he was planning on killing you to take over this dump!”\n“Now just calm down, and put down the gun…”\n“I’m not putting down shit and I’m not killing anyone else unless someone gives me cause to do so! What the fuck, was the dick in your mouth so good to you, you didn’t hear the gunshots and screaming out here? I’m sick of explaining this twice! Now I’M going back into MY room to get some sleep! And none of you better fucking disturb me for the rest of the night! And someone better clean up Elliot’s carcass from in front of my room when I wake up tomorrow!”\n\nYou return to your room.\n\n“Yeah, I think that went well.” You say to yourself.\n\nAfter the night of multiple “incidents” a lot of things happen. The first, is Elliot’s body being the first one dumped into the incinerator. The second being that Ron is immediately voted out by his own council who all follow the GZS guidelines. Apparently being gay was more of an offense than being incompetent, since GZS guidelines were explicit in not wanting homosexuals in the Community Shelters which he obviously lied about. Nina is unsurprisingly the most vocal about his vote out; in fact she ends up taking over. Ron and William move into a separate far room together and become social pariahs. Everyone who was previously friendly with Ron suddenly starts treating him like garbage. You never really cared for him, and thought he was an incompetent moron, but even you think it’s shitty for them to all just turn on him over who he happens to be fucking. But that’s how people are and that’s why you try to avoid them.\n\nYour situation is a little different, they can’t really treat you like a social pariah mainly because you were always one to begin with and another because everyone’s afraid you’ll shoot them. All of Elliot’s former friends have no doubt reinforced the belief in others that you’re dangerous. You don’t really care though, just as long as nobody fucks with you and stays out of your way (Which everyone does for the most part since you now walk around with it at all times)\n\nA year passes…\n\nThe shelter sees its first baby born and there are a couple of other pregnant women ready to pop as well. Nina has improved the place a little bit more. No doubt without anyone to fawn over now she’s throwing herself into her work. There’s actually a guy (Kyle) who’s has some medical knowledge now, they still don’t really have a good “tech guy” though and things are still being jury-rigged. Nina knows with a growing population this shelter needs to be in tip top running condition.\n\nYou get that expected knock on the door.\n\n“Hello, Nina.” You say.\n“Yeah hi. Look, I just want to know if you have any intention of helping us out or if you’re still going to remain an isolated asshole.”\n\nNothing like being blunt. Politics has really hardened Nina, she’s all business now it seems and lot less naïve.\n\nHow strangely appealing…\n",
  "page 240": "You swerve your van in the mutant bounty hunter’s direction, but he dodges out of the way so quick that you almost don’t see him move.\n\nAs he dodges, you hear your tires blow out (Which is weird since you didn’t hear any shots) before you to crash into some nearby rocks. You fly out the windshield and smash your head open into those same rocks, amazingly you aren’t immediately killed and you manage to crawl off your hood and onto the ground.\n\nUnfortunately a strange mutant worm like creature was making its home in the rocks and after you disturbed it, it came outside to investigate. You’re in no condition to escape.\n\nUnlike most, you became food for the worms while you were still alive.\n",
  "page 121": "You figure you need to address this now; you go to find Jack who’s hanging around the edges of the town as usual.\n\n“Hey Jack I need to talk to you.”\n“Aw Dad, I don’t feel like working with you in the boring ol’ computer room right now!”\n“Hey watch your mouth! And it’s not that anyway. It’s about all the talking you’ve doing lately about exploring the wasteland like Indiana fuckin’ Jones.”\n“Who?” Jack genuinely asks seeing as he’s never heard of the movie being born after the bomb and all.\n“Indiana…look never mind that, your Mom worries night and day that you’re going to go running off and get yourself killed.”\n“I’m not gonna run off…I mean I thought about it…but I just…I dunno…”\n“Well spit it out boy!”\n“It gets too boring here sometimes! I just wish I could go and explore the world like Leon!”\n“Yeah, well if you haven’t noticed, Leon’s missing an eye, his left ear and a couple of pieces of his fingers, not to mention he’s all scarred up and complains about pain all the time.”\n“Well I’D be more careful!” Jack boasts.\n“Hmmm, that’s what everyone says.  I know you and your friends think all the stories are exciting, but if you’d really paid close attention you’ll notice all damn danger as well. You know we’ve lost a few people doing that adventure shit, and the only one who still does it is Leon. Even Brenda stopped going out after she got shot in the leg. She was lucky she managed to escape. The world isn’t a safe place Jake. Never has been. And the way it is now, it’s even more dangerous.”\n\nJack looks at you.\n\n“We can’t stay here forever Dad.”\n\nYou see it in his eyes that he’s going to do what he wants and you aren’t going to be able to stop him. You don’t like it, and maybe you can’t stop him, but you can improve his odds.\n\n“Alright son, you gather all your little friends and meet me back here in a couple hours. Don’t go anywhere! You hear me?”\n“Okay, okay.”\n\nYou go and find Nina and explain the situation, she’s of course completely opposed to the idea and it takes some reasoning, but eventually she sees you have a point, even if she doesn’t like it. You tell her to go inform the other parents; in the meantime you go and fetch Brenda and Leon.\n\nYou meet Jack who’s standing around with a bunch of his other friends and most of the other young people in town. Brenda and Leon are behind you.\n\n“Alright Jack, if exploration is what you want, you ain’t gonna do it unprepared. You all know these two. Brenda here is going to teach all of you how to shoot properly. We’ve got plenty of guns and ammo now and she’s the best marksperson here. Before ANY of you people go out anywhere you better know how to aim your damn weapons. After a month of that, then you’ll be going out, with Leon. He’ll be able to give you on the job training with the whole explorer thing. In time, you’ll be able to go out by yourselves. Now before any of this goes down, all of you are probably gonna have to discuss this with your parents or some shit, so you’re all gonna have to work out your own personal lives yourselves, but Jack you’ve got a reluctant okay from both me and your mother.”\n“…I dunno what to say, I mean thanks Dad.” Jack smiles.\n“What you can do is pay attention to Brenda and Leon’s instructions and not get yourself killed! And here, take this. It’s saved more than a few lives.” You say and hand your pistol to Jack.\n\nAnd so begins the training. In time most of them go off to pursue their adventures elsewhere, naturally the world being what it is now, some don’t return, but for those that do return most come back to stay permanently. Just a little bit of the taste of the outside world is all most of them needed to see it’s a lot better to stay in New Haven! When Jake returns he’s ready once again to follow in your footsteps.\n\n“See Nina, I knew my idea would work. Let ‘em go out in the world for a little while and they’ll come to appreciate the comforts of this place! Might be boring here, but at least you don’t have some motherfucker with a Mohawk shooting at you because he likes the boots you got on. They just needed some training first to give them a chance to survive.”\n“Well I’m just glad Jack’s alright.”\n\nAs you and Nina breathe a sigh of relief that Jack’s home in one piece, little did you realize that your idea set a major plan in motion.\n\nIn time, the New Haven Militia is created.\n\nThirty Years pass…\n\n\nFifty years have gone by you briefly realize as you look at the old shelter entrance; it’s hardly ever used anymore. Extensive changes have been made to it so it’s rarely necessary to go down there anymore, only Jack and few other technicians go down there to check on the water purification system now in place. Practically everything else has been dismantled and used to help build up the surface of New Haven. New Haven has grown far beyond the shelter that you entered so long ago.\n\nYou don’t think you ever saw this happening. Nobody did. The place is very large now; populated with the children of those you entered the shelter with as well as refugees from other places. Mostly everyone you originally knew is gone, not that you were ever one to greatly socialize, but still you do miss people like Leon, Brenda and Charles, hell you even miss Ron.\n\nYou especially miss your beloved wife Nina. It’s been two years since she died. You miss her everyday. Jack comes by with his family to keep you company sometimes, but nowadays all you want is solitude.\n\nYou enter the shelter and go down the elevator. You probably aren’t supposed to be down here, but you don’t care, you’re going to live in the past for awhile.\n\nYou walk around the practically gutted shelter and remember all the things that happened.\n\nHere’s where you first met Nina, you never thought you’d end up marrying and having a child with her someday, but even though you were annoyed by first impressions, (As she probably was with you!) you always thought she was beautiful.\n\nHere’s where you shot Elliot. To this day you know you did the right thing. There’s no doubt in your mind that things would’ve been very different had he taken over.\n\nHere’s where Jack was born. You remember Kyle having a hell of a time getting him to come out. He always could be a little stubborn. You just remembered you’re supposed to have a check up appointment with Kyle’s daughter Shelia. It can wait though; you’re busy right now.\n\nAh now here it is. Your old room. You remember spending a majority of your initial time here. Still has the shelter manual on the table. You insisted that this room remain intact when the shelter was in the final stages of being stripped. You always knew you’d return here some day.\n\nYou lie down on the bed and enjoy the peace and quiet from the surface. Slowly you begin to get drowsy.\n\n“Ahhh, so peaceful with no other people around…I just wish Nina was here with me to enjoy it too…” you say to yourself as you drift off to sleep.\n",
  "page 120": "The longer you can keep an eye on him the less likely he’ll be sneaking off, maybe you can drum some discipline into his head again too, because apparently he lost some of it. You go to find Jake who’s hanging around the edges of town as usual.\n\n“Hey Jack come here!”\n“Aw Dad, I don’t feel like working with you in the boring ol’ computer room right now!”\n“Boy, you better get your ass to that computer room!”\n\nJack follows you in defeat before you embarrass him anymore in front of his friends. When you arrive in the computer room Charles is there. Jack slumps down in a chair next to a console.\n\n“Oh hey there, I didn’t expect to see you both here today.” Charles says unsure of how he’s suppose to respond to this situation.”\n“Yeah, well Jack needs to spend some extra time down here, he’s been slackin’ lately.”\n“I ain’t been slackin’!” Jake protests.\n“You’ve been slackin’! Now check the power systems!”\n“(Sigh) Fine! I dunno why we have to do this for; there hasn’t been a problem with this thing for years.”\n“Yeah, and it’s gonna STAY that way too! The only reason why we haven’t had problems is because I’m on top of things all the time! If I let this thing go to shit, no more clean water supply for us! Would you like that? Drinking piss water?”\n“I know I sure wouldn’t.” Charles mumbles.\n“Damnit Dad this is boring! I don’t wanna be doing this shit! I wanna go out an explore the world like Leon!”\n“Like Leon huh? In case you’re blind, you’ll notice Leon’s got a missing eye, a missing left ear and pieces of his fingers. That’s what the rest of the world does to you, if you slip up just slightly and nobody’s perfect. Look at Brenda, she’s the best marksperson in this place and she got herself shot in the leg which stopped her from going out. She now walks with a permanent limp! Is that what you want?”\n“God you’re a fucking control freak Dad! I thought Mom was bad, but…”\n\nOver the line. That one incurred Jack a wrap to the head.\n\n“DON’T YOU DARE TALK ABOUT YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY!” you bellow as Jack holds his head.\n“Um…I think my shift is over, see ya later!” Charles says getting out the way of this family squabble.\n\nThe rest of the time in the computer room is silent. Jack doesn’t say anything, he just sullenly does what you tell him. The next day he does the same thing, and the day after that, and so on, until one day he doesn’t. Mainly because he’s run away with some of his friends and stolen Leon’s beat up car. Nina is very distraught along with many other parents. The only thing is that Leon said it doesn’t have that much gas in it because he hasn’t been able to come across any lately.\n\nYou, some of the other fathers and Leon go looking for all of them. You first head towards Ashtown thinking that maybe they just went there to be “a little rebellious”. You come across the car, which they obviously abandoned, and continue to Ashtown with hope that Jack still headed that way, but no such luck. When you arrive, the people their say they haven’t seen anyone come by in weeks.\n\nDays go by and at one point Leon thinks he’s got a lead, but then the worst happens. You’re attacked by crazed cannibals and their mutant dogs. You immediately tag one of the cannibals and duck behind a rock. But the cannibals also have guns and while the other fathers have weapons too, they haven’t been practicing with them like you and Leon have. They’re a lot better shots, you see a few of your fellow parents go down for the count, while the dogs finish them off. Leon holds his own, and you and he manage to take out all the cannibals, but it’s the fucking dogs that give you trouble…\n\nThree of them leap onto Leon, knocking his weapon from his hand, he sticks his thumbs in the eyes of the one that tried to take out his throat, but that still doesn’t stop it from biting him in the face before it dies, one is chewing on his chest though and the other one is going to town on his crotch. You’d try to help him, but you got one that came out of nowhere that rips into your leg. You shoot the damn thing in the head three times before it lets go. You then struggle to stand and shoot the other couple dogs, but its too late, Leon’s a mangled corpse.\n\n“FUCK!” you shout in frustration looking at the dead all around you. You collapse to the ground and put your hands on your face thinking about how this got all fucked up and then that’s when you notice the smoke coming from the cannibal camp and the smell of burning flesh. Your heart sinks and you drag yourself over for a closer look.\n\n“No…don’t let it…” you to yourself. You see some bones and clothing. Some on it looks like that of some of the other parent’s kids. You don’t see anything of Jack’s. You don’t know if he got away, or they ate him and threw the clothing elsewhere or what. Somehow it doesn’t really matter; you haven’t found him, so for all intents and purposes he’s dead or at best; missing.\n\nAfter grabbing all the remaining water you can from the others you make the long painful journey back to New Haven, thinking about what you’re going to tell everyone. Much has been lost this day.\n\nWhen you get back you collapse again, this time you feel a fever. Brenda and Kyle immediately see to you. It’s your leg, its festering and infected from the mutant dog bite. Nothing can be done; you get it chopped off at the knee. The only good thing is you were unconscious at the time.\n\nAfter you get over the initially shock of waking up to a peg leg, you only have more bad news for everyone, especially Nina. However, many lives of husbands and children have been lost and someone MUST take the blame. And that someone happens to be you just because you happened to be the lucky one to come back alive.\n\nNina is voted out of her position on the council for some made up reason which you protest loudly, but it hardly bothers her since she’s been preoccupied ever since you came back with the bad news. She holds on to sanity by making herself believe that Jack DID escape and is somewhere out there wandering the world.\n\nThey can’t get rid of you so easily since even with Charles around you’re still the only guy who can keep the computer system running everything working right, but most of the population sure gives you a hard time. If you weren’t walking around on a fucking peg, you’d start kicking some ass. As a few years goes by, finally you get sick of the shit and say:\n\n“Fuck it. Let ‘em rot. They can run this shit themselves, this place is getting dead anyway. Nina, we’re going to Ashtown.”\n“Ashtown? But that’s so far away! And you’re walking on that peg!”\n“I didn’t mean go right this minute or by ourselves, I meant the next trade caravan from Ashtown that comes by we’re tagging along with it.”\n“We’re just going to pick up and leave? Just like that? After all these years?”\n“Hey, I don’t like it either, but its obvious all of our efforts weren’t ever appreciated here. Yours OR mine. Since they hate us so much, then let ‘em live here without our help. There’s nothing for us here now. All we got left is each other.”\n\nNina agrees and holds you tightly while telling you how much she loves you.\n\nWhen the Ashtown caravan comes around you and Nina have all your stuff packed. They’re only too happy to take you with them, since Ashtown has been trying to get a couple old generators working to maximum efficiency and they heard you were good at that sort of thing.\n\nYou spend your remaining life in Ashtown. It isn’t as secure in safety as it was in New Haven, but at least you had Nina to make it equally as comfortable.\n",
  "page 241": "You figure he’s probably expecting that, so you speed up and duck your head down. You hear the sound of two of your tires blowing out, which is strange because you didn’t hear any shots. You just barely avoid crashing into some nearby rocks; however you do flip your van on its side.\n\nCursing your situation, you quickly recover, grab what supplies you can and crawl out the side window. You briefly turn your head to see how far the mutant bounty hunter is, but he’s completely disappeared. You have no idea where he’s gone. Just then a different gunshot is heard and coming from another direction down the road.\n\n“Hey get that bastard, we gotta collect that bounty!” an armored man says to another.\n\n“What the fuck? Did they hire the whole state to bring me down?” you say to yourself hauling ass out of the area, with more bullets whizzing your way.\n\nEventually you manage to lose all of them. You find a nearby abandoned gas station to rest in and reflect on things. That was a very close call. Its obvious The Combine is REALLY out for your blood, they got bounty hunters scouring the wasteland for you, and you’ve noticed your encounters have only increased recently.\n\nThis is going to be your life now. You’re going to be hunted until the day you die which will be soon, if you aren’t careful. You can kill all the Combine troops, hunters and mercs you want, they’ll still send people after you.\n\nThe only thing you can do is leave the area altogether or find some place to hide for awhile.\n",
  "page 6": "You calmly go to your van and start it up. You drive towards the city like you would if you were going to work. You see large black smoke clouds over it in the distance, out of control fires do doubt. You guess the exodus from the city is over, because the roads are pretty empty, except for the various car wrecks you pass by, this would almost be a peaceful “Sunday drive” if there wasn’t hints of carnage on the road and the fact that it was Monday.\n\nAs you get closer to the city, your van stalls and then stops completely. You don’t bother to turn it back on instead you get out of your car and look up in the sky shielding your eyes from the sun shining down.\n\nYou see a bright light and then nothing at all.\n",
  "page 145": "Like there was any other choice?\n\nYou slide in next to Marina who guns the engine and screeches off. Considering Harry’s hatred of you and the fact that this is considering going AWOL and stealing Combine equipment, you aren’t just going to get away with this.\n\n\nYou don’t get far when you’re soon pursued by other vehicles. You tell Marina to concentrate on driving, while you attempt to do some road warrior shit. Luckily you’re still an excellent marksman, and you manage to either shoot the tires or the drivers of the cars and motorcycles in pursuit of you. Eventually you escape.\n\nAfter a few days of driving you and Marina start wondering where you’re going to go. You can’t drive forever, you’ll run out gas eventually and you don’t relish the idea of walking.\n\nHowever, once again luck is with you and you find a small place called Ashtown where you stop. Fortunately the people seem to be friendly. You immediately make yourself useful by helping with eliminating some bandits and raiders (A bit like the old days actually). You and Marina decide to stay and make a new life here, though in the back of your mind you’re always expecting some sort of arrival of the Combine, maybe not coming to look for you specifically, but you know they’re probably still expanding.\n\nAbout a year passes and nothing unusual happens, until a wandering traveler passing through decides to talk to you for some reason while you’re sitting in the local café.\n\n“Hey friend.” The traveler says.\n“Hmn.” You reply still reading a book.\n“This place is a pretty well organized town. Pleasant too. Glad I found it.”\n“It’s better than most places.” You say still without looking up.\n“Hey, I know what you mean. It’s a crazy fucking world out there. What with the Cybernetic Evolution and all.”\n“Cybernetic Evolution?” you ask finally looking up.\n“Yeah! You never heard of them? Well I guess I should warn you then. It’s this group of killer cyborgs that want to remake humanity or exterminate them if they don’t comply. They’re supposedly from some sort of secret military base that was doing high tech experiments. There are robots too, but mostly cyborgs. I’m surprised they haven’t headed this way, but then again, they’ve been pretty busy trying to combat the Combine. Never thought I’d be glad that the Combine exists, but I gotta say if it weren’t for them, the CE would’ve probably expanded all over the fuckin’ place by now and I guarantee we wouldn’t be sitting here having this pleasant conversation.”\n“Hmm, so the Combine is winning?” you ask.\n“Well, I wouldn’t say that, it’s more like a stalemate. Kind of a good thing too, since I don’t really want them winning either. Those Combine bastards are a bunch of bullying fascists. Especially with that fucker Damon in charge.”\n“Damon? Who’s that?”\n“Damon, is the newest leader of the Combine. Thinks he’s some sort of military genius, but all he is, is a common desert thug who’s a little more intelligent than his buddies, probably still more competent than the last leader Harry who Damon killed to get the job.”\n\nA smile forms across your face when you hear that news, while the traveler continues his story\n\n“Anyway that’s partly one of the reasons I’m traveling. I don’t want to be around when the war finally ends, either way the people who live nearby are going to lose…speaking of which I gotta get going, nice talking to you.”\n\nAfter the traveler leaves you do likewise and tell Marina what you just heard. She asks you if you think if it would be a good idea to leave as well. Perhaps you haven’t made all the right decisions in this new harsh world, but if nothing else you’ve at least been able to make good decisions concerning your own survival and you’re about to make another one.\n\nYou and Marina pack your belongings. Its time to move on again, you figure you should get out now while you can.\n\nYou say goodbye to the few acquaintances you’ve had since your time here and warn them about the CE-Combine War before leaving. It’s up to them what they’re going to do.\n\nAnd once again, you and Marina are off, with the unknown future ahead of you.\n",
  "page 266": "You decide to stay out of this little war they got going, plan on just keeping a low profile. Hopefully they’ll never come scouting around your warehouse to closely.\n\nA few months pass and The Zeropolis Guard discovers your little slice of solitude one day, you awaken to the sounds of your door being blown off its hinges and soldiers coming in.\n\n\n“Holy shit, there’s someone living here!” one of them remarks.\n“What the fuck man? You blew up my door!” you shout trying to gather your wits from being asleep.\n“Yeah? Well what the hell are you doing down here anyway?” a mean heavily scarred mutant asks.\n“I live here! What’s it to you? Don’t you have Ferals to kill or some shit?”\n“We were looking for some and we found this place…looks like you got quite the set up here. Generator, water recycler…this place would make a good living quarters for the Captain.”\n“What? HELL NO! This is my home! You can’t just…”\n“Quiet civvy, this place is now the property of The Zeropolis Guard, you got a problem with it, tough. Maybe if you join up though you can help protect the place, but for now you better get your shit and leave AND you can leave that pistol right there as well. You’re under our protection, you don’t need that anymore.”\n“Fuck you! I’ve spoke with Captain Salazar before and even HE let me keep it!”\n“Yeah, well things have changed since then, we’re uh…having a weapon shortage, so shut the fuck up and get the fuck out! You ain’t winning this one and if you persist in this act of civil disobedience I’ll fuckin’ just shoot you right now!”\n\nYou have little choice in this matter. You grab what little belongings you can still take with you and get evicted from your home. You eventually find an abandoned building in one of the neighborhoods to dwell in, but its not nearly as nice. You try to go complain to Captain Salazar personally, but you just get stonewalled and blown off all the time. They just tell you that if you really want a weapon that badly you should officially join instead of complaining. In fact they begin to warn you that if you don’t like being under their protection, you can leave and see how much you’d like it elsewhere.\n\nThat is a tempting thing to do because you’ll be damned if you’ll join these fuckin’ fascists at this point. Though you’re mad enough to try to do something a little more proactive as well.\n",

Last time you heard, the city was in complete anarchy, riots were breaking out and the National Guard was shooting people, can’t get supplies from there now. The nearest general store closed up by its owner who headed up north with his family a month ago. Whatever supplies you have in your house will have to do. You start walking around armed at all times as you often think you’ll be attacked by stray looters, who have escaped the city, but then again you live in a house on the dead end of wilderness, nobody ever comes out this way normally, and you never see another living soul.\n\nYou’re all alone.\n\nYou spend much of your time watching TV and on the internet keeping up on events, one day blurring into the next as you often fall asleep after spending long amounts of time of being awake…\n\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up from the sofa.\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE….”\n\nYou wake up to a test pattern on TV.\n\nThis is it.\n",

You tell Marina to fire upon them, while you attempt to lose them. She does her best, but she’s not an expert marksperson like you. One of those raider scumbags that have been an all too common in the new Combine recruitment policy manages to drive up to your side window and shoot a crossbow bolt right through your neck.\n\nYou clutch at your mortal wound and lose control of the car, flipping it over and killing Marina as well.\n",
  "page 265": "You see where this is going; the Zeropolis Guard is fully intent on their delusional plan and they’re going to be the top assholes in this area, so you might as well join them to reap the benefits. It’s better than being at their complete mercy and it’s certainly better than living in fear of the Shadow Horde, at least the Guard seems to want to restore order.\n\nThe next day you go find Captain Salazar who is pretty easy to find since he’s currently giving speeches in the streets to the Dust District inhabitants of how they should actively join the Zeropolis Guard. Not too many takers, but none of them are in any position to argue with the occupation. When you go up to Salazar to tell him you’re interested in joining, he’s pleased to just have someone taking him up on his offer.\n\nOf course he wants to know more about you and where you’re currently staying, and you do tell him about the warehouse, just not about the secret GZS rooms underneath. He’s a little bewildered of why you’re staying there rather than a proper house in one of the neighborhoods, or even your own house. To this you reply that you used to live in one of the Downtown apartments, and couldn’t live there anymore due to the danger. You mention during your time of madness you ended up wandering this way and just took up residence there and now even though you’re better, you’ve made it your home and feel comfortable at that place. You also go on to say that you prefer to be away from large crowds of people.\n\nCaptain Salazar frowns at that last statement.\n\n“Y’know we are a military unit, teamwork is encouraged here…though I suppose we need all the help we can get right now, so I guess you’ll be on scouting duty. Maybe if you prove yourself, I’ll put you on sniper duty. As for your living arrangements…I guess you can stay there. That area is pretty empty and there isn’t anything there except a few warehouses, we’re more interested in the plant and factory. However it’s the perfect place where the Shadow Horde might stage a sneak attack from due to its remoteness. So consider yourself the sentry in that area. I wish we could use our radios, but the radiation levels here…well are sort of screwing up the signals. We’ve been trying to train messenger rats, but so far the little furry bastards just run off to the nearest source of food, so you’ll be reporting to me personally every two days where I’ll either give you new instructions or tell you to continue what you’re doing. Unless I hear otherwise and you don’t report, I’ll give you one more day and then I’ll assume you’re either dead or have deserted. If you’re dead then you’re dead, but if I find out you’ve deserted, my wrath will be terrible, and you’ll wish you were dead.”\n“Okay, but what if I was captured?”\n“Ha ha ha ha! You’re joking right? Not really much of a chance of that happening. Ferals just kill, and the Shadow Horde might capture you, but they won’t let you live afterwards. I trust you won’t let yourself get captured then right?”\n“Guess not.”\n“Good. Let’s see, what can you do…I got everyone else working on other things, right now we’re tracking down all the sewer manholes in the area and shoving the remains of cars on top of them. Others have been sent to raid nearby police stations in the hopes of finding more weapons and ammo. Okay what you’ll be doing is scouting and clearing out the factory; we’ve discovered that all the Feral activity in the area has been coming from those places. At least that’s where we’ve seen them all run off to, you can go retrieve your assault rifle seeing as I haven’t given it to anyone else yet.”\n“Am I working by myself, or with others?”\n“Well from the impression of getting, you’d probably prefer working alone, but that’s simply too dangerous for what I’m sending you in to do, you’ll need someone watching your back, so I’m sure you’re familiar with Private Ackman here…”\n\nYou then see the soldier who kicked you yesterday. He doesn’t look any friendlier and just nods at you.\n\n“There will be other small detachments exploring various parts of the factory as well so more ground can be covered, but for the most part you two are on your own. Dimissed.”\n\nYou and Ackman go carry out the mission in relative silence. Private Ackman doesn’t seem to care for you, or at best he doesn’t want talk to you unless it’s absolutely necessary. This doesn’t really bother you though since he is a good fighter, and is making this mission a lot easier. The factory is a huge place though even in its current devastated state; there are several sections, multiple levels and it covers a lot of land. It’s going to take awhile.\n\nAfter a few months of factory clearing you and Ackman have the highest Feral body count so far, and their attacks on the Dust District are becoming non-existent. Due to this accomplishment, many of the inhabitants have a little more confidence in the Zeropolis Guard and as a result more people have volunteer to help, either by joining directly or by attempting to fix the power plant. Shadow Horde attacks occur sometimes, but even those aren’t as frequent. Zeropolis is a big place, and presumably they’ve turned their attention to easier areas.\n\nFour years pass…\n\nIt’s been five years since you set foot in Zeropolis, and the place has changed quite a bit, well in your area anyway.\n\nMost of the factory has been safely stripped to help rebuild the district. The nearby plant has parts of it fixed and partial electricity has been restored to the district as well. Feral attacks are completely unheard of in the area now, they’ve either all been killed, or in a few cases, managed to retain their sanity again.\n\nThe Zeropolis Guard has firm control of the area and has been attempting to restore a few old vehicles to work again mainly using jury-rigged steam engines, though the many stills created to make hooch certainly serve the same purpose to create “Garbage fuel” as it were for vehicles. Oddly one thing that has surprised everyone is that new mutants are actually being born! Not many, but it still came as a surprise when one of the female mutants found out she was pregnant, when it was assumed everyone would’ve been sterile due to the radiation, but then again the fact that you’re all still alive is proving that you’re all working on a different biological level now.\n\nYou’ve risen in rank with your superior sniping skills, and saving others you’ve effectively become second in command. You’re looked upon as sort of a “hero” figure among the Dust District.\n\nThe Shadow Horde is still around, but attacks have less frequent. This perpetual war with them is basically at a standstill. The Zeropolis Guard has many more resources, but not nearly enough people. Captain Salazar is irritated by this fact, but there’s not much he can do about it. His big idea of bringing order to the entire City is slowly being crushed as he realizes this might never be possible. In desperation he’s sent a few people OUT of Zeropolis in the hopes of somehow getting help, but so far all his efforts have resulted in failure. People don’t like or trust mutant, and it’s mainly due to another organization attempting to “tame the wasteland” known as The Combine. With most of the outside towns under their control, they’ve developed “a shoot mutants from the City on sight” policy. Salazar’s behavior which was at one time just pleasantly dedicated is now becoming obsessively totalitarian.\n\nHowever, you’re standing by your warehouse home one day when you see some outsiders visit Zeropolis. They aren’t entirely human though, they look like cyborgs. Which would explain why they have no rad suits.\n\nThere have been reports of The Combine currently at war with their own enemy called the Cybernetic Evolution. You’re not sure what it’s all about, but you’re guessing they probably see themselves as superior to humans. (You’ve seen enough movies in the past to know that’s always the case!)\n\nYou can’t imagine what they’d be doing here, unless they intend on proving themselves superior to mutants as well. There aren’t many of them, but most of them are heavily armed.\n",
  "page 268": "You don’t give a shit if it kills you, you’re not going to just stand by and let these fucktards treat you like their bitch. You immediately begin to make plans.\n\nYou start off just by getting a feel of the general opinion of the Guard, by others. So far, there isn’t a lot opinion one way or another. They feel safer, but much like you they have suffered the liberties taken by the Guard. Eventually you do find a few people that outright don’t like them, and you capitalize on that by having those people to “recruit” and influence others.\n\nAfter a few months you’ve managed to form somewhat of a real underground movement. The next steps are taken which involves out right sneak attacks on Guard soldiers and taking their weapons. This is when the Guard begins to take real notice of the Dust Dissident Movement and begins becoming more restrictive. This of course ends up working in your favor as now even those that had no previous problem with the Guard begin openly complaining. In the meantime you change locations all the time just barely keeping one step ahead of the Guard.\n\nA year passes and the entire Dust District is in as much chaos as it was right after the bombs first hit. The Zeropolis Guard is fighting a losing war with the Shadow Horde as well as trying to put down an on going insurrection. You love it. Everyday more of them die and are unable to replace their losses, eventually Captain Salazar himself is assassinated by one of your own people breaking the hold and morale of the Zeropolis Guard. The survivors end up leaving and scattering to unknown parts of the City.\n\nYou’ve won, but it is a Pyrrhic victory.\n\nWithout the Guard keeping order and routine protection, the Shadow Horde moves in at full force. They begin to stalk the streets at night and breaking into homes to slaughter its inhabitants.\n\nThe Dust Dissident Movement attempts to take up the mantle of protectors, but the Shadow Horde is a different type of enemy, they don’t try to occupy; they come in and destroy. Hit and run tactics are useless against an enemy that does the same thing and does it a whole lot better as you unfortunately come to find out when you’re meeting with your remaining people one night and a bunch of Horde members swarm your hideout and kill everyone inside.\n",
  "page 7": "It’s always been like you to do things at the last minute.\n\nAfter grabbing your pistol and all the food and drink you can, then heading down in the basement with it, you think that things probably won’t be that bad. After all you don’t live in the city, or even by an important city, surely not EVERY place will get bombed. It’s not like you live on the east or west coast, now those people are going to be fucked.\n\nNo, all you have to do is wait this out, and then things will get back to normal…okay well maybe not normal, but surely the government will restore order of some sort, you’re sure they have a complex plan for this kind of thing.\n\n\nEventually you hear a very loud noise; whatever light you had on in the basement immediately goes out as you can hear your house being hit by a powerful force. You curl up in a ball and hold your ears half expecting the entire house to collapse in on you, but it doesn’t happen.\n\nYou stay in the basement, for what you guess to be a week. You mostly stumble around in the darkness as reality begins to set in and destroy your previous delusions. You mainly think about how you should’ve planned things out better, especially since your food and drink are running out. The only thing you know really know about nuclear attacks is what you’ve learned from movies, video games and comic books. You can only hope some of that shit was helpful, as you have little choice, but to leave your basement, the bucket you were using to relieve yourself down there was really starting to stink anyway.\n\nYou open up your basement door, which remarkably stayed intact, along with most of your house. The windows and other glass objects have all broke, and there’s no power, but that’s about it. You can only guess that whatever it was that hit, was far enough away and probably very low yield. You don’t really want to think about the radioactivity factor though; you’ll know if you’re catching a lethal dose soon enough if your hair and teeth start falling out and you begin vomiting blood.\n\nDamn you wish you bought that bomb shelter…\n\nYou check the refrigerator again for more food, but there won’t be enough to last you one day. You wonder if the water is still working and turn on the faucet, of course it doesn’t, you don’t think you’d want to risk drinking any of it anyway. Well it looks like you can’t stay in your house either; you’re going to have to leave to find food and some sort of drinkable liquid.\n\nDamn you wish you bought that bomb shelter…\n\nWell if you’re going to leave, you decide some sort of protection is in order; you grab some dishwashing gloves underneath the sink, some safety goggles you’ve had since you college chemistry class, a winter coat and finally a scarf your grandmother knit you for one of your birthdays to wrap over your mouth. You look somewhat silly in this getup and it probably won’t protect you at all, but you’re back to deluding yourself again which is probably a good thing since your relapses into fantasy are keeping you from breaking down completely.\n\nYou open your dented garage door and get in your old van expecting it not to work, surprisingly it does. You thought it wouldn’t due to all that stuff you remember hearing about EMP waves or something, then again your car was built in a year before they started mounting entire computers in the fucking things, so maybe that’s why it still works. You don’t know, you’re just glad its one of the things you still have that functions, you didn’t want to be riding that bike you bought and hardly ever used. You throw your backpack of useful items (flashlight, small tool set, first aid kit, etc) into the van and ponder where to go.\n\nYou’ve got two choices that immediately come to mind assuming both still exist; one is that “Mom \u0026 Pop” General Store that was abandoned at least a month ago. You can’t imagine they took everything from the place. The other choice is to risk going to the city and finding something there. Despite all the looting and mass exodus that was going on there before any of this went down, the city’s still a big place and there’s probably lots of useful stuff there, the problem is wondering if you’ll be heading into a death zone. That radioactivity concern is still in the back of your mind.\n\nDamn you wish you bought that bomb shelter…\n",
  "page 267": "You don’t really have the connections to start inciting revolutions. You wouldn’t know where to begin and chances are you’d end up getting yourself killed immediately. As much as you don’t want to leave, you can’t live under such oppression anymore, so you decide to travel to another part of Zeropolis.\n\nYou travel quite a bit, before remembering again that the rest of the City isn’t nearly as safe as the Dust District! You’re attacked by Ferals at nearly every turn, and worse you don’t even have any type of long range weapon to fight them off with. Even the mutants that aren’t Ferals have a gang like mentality that is hostile to any not in their immediate group. After running and hiding many times, and being wounded as well, you come to the conclusion that you’ll have to grin and bear it and return to the Dust District.\n\nSadly you never make it, as a particularly large group of Ferals ambush you and proceed to make you wish you never came to the City in the first place.\n",
  "page 2": "You turn off the TV and head to work, no point in worrying about things you can’t do shit about. You have other real everyday problems to deal with.\n\nYou go about your mundane life, doing mundane tasks at your mundane job, talking to your mundane co-workers about mundane things. Not much changes.\n\nOne month later...\n\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up from the sofa like you always do, dreading to have to go to work at your pointless job. You haven’t been sleeping well lately, you don’t know what the hell the problem is, and all you know is you’re going to be tired for work again. As you go through your routine of getting ready, the TV can be heard; as usual you left it on from the night before.\n\n“…Russian hardliners seized control of the government…Chinese epidemic has worsened; entire country is under quarantine…UK has withdrawn all association from the EU…Senate dissolved in US, martial law enacted…India declared open war on Pakistan…mass starvation in Africa… world wide depression…\n\nSame old doom and gloom on TV, a lot more serious now though. Those “silly” bomb shelter infomercials have increased; you’ve also been noticing an increase in survival type book titles whenever you browse the book stores now and the Emergency broadcasting system has been doing A LOT of tests lately. Something bad is going to happen and it’s going to happen soon.\n\nYou go about your life which isn’t quite so mundane, world politics is a constant topic at work, and many of your co-workers aren’t even coming in to do their job. All the married ones are no doubt spending time with their families, in fact the work place really isn’t a work place anymore so much as it is a “socializing site”. A lot of them believe the world is coming to an end anyway, so they might as well have a good time. Attempting to go about your normal life isn’t an option anymore; neither is buying a bomb shelter at this late stage.\n",
  "page 149": "You’ve had your mind debates before about whether to leave or not, but it looks like this is the final one. You never sought this path and you certainly don’t want to be commanding anything, but staying here really isn’t an option anymore. Time to move on. In some ways you always thought it would come to this one day.\n“I can’t do it Colonel. Sorry.”\n“Very well then, I guess I can only hope Harry’s ruthless nature and hamfisted way of leading works. After you leave, send him to see me. We won’t speak again.”\n\nYou leave and for once go find Harry. He’s in the cafeteria screaming at someone to scrub the floor harder. When he sees you, he gives you the typical hostility.\n\n“What the hell do you want Cupcake?” he sneers.\n“The Colonel wants to see you, better hurry too he doesn’t have much time.”\n\nHarry doesn’t bother to retort, his eyes seem to light up at the prospect that the Colonel is dying and that this could ONLY mean he’s getting official command. In his haste of rushing past you, he doesn’t notice your foot, which you purposely stick out to trip him. He falls on floor and lands squarely on his nose, breaking it.\n\n“AH SHIT!” he yells holding his nose while still on the floor.\n“Whoops, sorry about that, cupcake.” You say walking out the cafeteria.\n\nYou go back to your room and start packing your belongings and determining what might be useful, Marina is there and wondering what’s going on.\n\n“What’re you doing?”\n“Leaving. My time here is done; Harry’s going to take control of the Combine, which probably won’t be for long if the Colonel’s predictions are true. Now Marina, you know I love you, and you say you love me. So if you really do, you’ll come with me.”\n“And where the hell are we supposed to be going?”\n“I know a place. A place I found in my travels which I never told anyone about, and apparently nobody else found, hopefully it’s still a friendly place.”\n“Well hold on, isn’t there some other way?”\n“Not unless Harry’s attitude towards me does a complete turn around. I’m not going to stay some place where my life is in constant danger and besides the Colonel’s going on about some robot invasion he think is going to take place. Can’t say I want to stick around for that either. And I can’t say I want YOU to stick around for it. Just come with me, why is that so difficult?”\n“Because I don’t believe in fucking running from my home! Do you understand that THIS place has basically been my home longer than it’s been yours? And that most of these people I’m friends with, and they’re like a family to me? Maybe YOU don’t have that bond, but I do. I’m not just going to abandon this place. Look, maybe you can talk to the Colonel, I mean he respects you more than you might think, maybe he’d see you as a more stable candidate to command this place, and then…”\n”He already tried to offer me the job. I turned it down.”\n“You what?!”\n“I turned it down! I don’t want the fucking responsibility. I never did. I’ve always said I’ve always just stayed here for you and for how you rescued me from dying in a nuclear firestorm, but my survival is severely at stake if I stay here. I mean what do you want me to die for you or something?”\n“I wanted you to be a fucking man and be ambitious, which I thought you were. I always saw potential in you, I saw it way back before the bombs hit. I thought you were trying to take some initiative by moving up the ranks like you did. Like you had your eyes set on becoming leader of this place. I saw you being able to really help the rebuilding process. I mean you were vital in many of our alliances. And what did you do? You just threw all of that work down the fucking drain, because you’re fucking scared of more responsibility.”\n\nYou’ve always known Marina to be a bit of a “Lady Macbeth” type with her always wanting you to strive for power and be ambitious. And out of your feelings toward her, you have tried to oblige that to a degree, but after hearing this shit, you can see you were almost nothing more than some sort of pawn. You don’t need this. You never needed this. Yet, there’s no point in arguing. This is hard enough as it is. You take the high road with Marina.\n\n“Marina, I’m just gonna say this, you saw something in me that was never there to begin with. I’m sorry to disappoint you…thanks for saving my life and hopefully you have a nice one. Maybe you can marry Harry or even better, take control yourself, since you seem to have the proper mindset and already a lot smarter.”\n\nMarina is silent. You finish packing and open the door, you linger a bit hoping she changes her mind, but you can tell she isn’t when she turns her head to keep you from seeing that she’s obviously upset and going to cry.\n\nYou slam the door and go back up top to the surface; you take one of the motorcycles and zoom off. You do it all the time so nobody finds you leaving out of the ordinary. Eventually you head back to Lost Springs. Looks like it did when you found the place four years ago. You’re welcomed again, but they tell you they still aren’t interested in joining the Compound. You laugh and say that’s not why you’re here and immediately ask if there’s any work that needs to be done since you plan of staying on a permanent basis.\n\nA year passes relatively uneventfully in Lost Springs.\n\nOne day a wandering traveler passes through. For whatever reason he strikes up a conversation with you while you’re sitting the local cafe.\n\n“Hey friend.” The traveler says.\n“Hmn.” You reply still reading a book.\n“This place is pretty remote huh? It was only by sheer dumb luck I stumbled upon it, you guys don’t get many people coming here do you?”\n“Other than me, you’d be the first in a long time. We’re pretty self-sufficient here and like to keep to ourselves.” You say still without looking up.\n“Hey, good idea. It’s a crazy fucking world out there. I say you got the set up. Still, doesn’t the Cybernetic Evolution worry you?”\n“Cybernetic Evolution?” you ask finally looking up.\n“Yeah! You never heard of them? Well I guess I should warn you then. It’s this group of killer cyborgs that want to remake humanity or exterminate them if they don’t comply. There’s robots too, but mostly cyborgs. I heard they’re lead by some nut case called Alex. They’ve been spreading all over the place; the Combine is losing the war with them. That’s mainly why I’m trying to get out of the area.”\n“Hold on, the Combine?”\n“Yeah! Come on you never heard of them either? Wow you are in your own little world! The Combine is an alliance of towns with the head base called Fort Justice. Of course Fort Justice was razed to the ground months ago, and now the current towns are wondering how to proceed since Fort Justice was where the line was being held not to mention where the best soldiers were. I heard nobody was spared. Now most of the towns are suffering raider attacks again who are taking advantage of the chaos as well as attacks from the CE. Looks fucking bleak man.”\n\nBleak indeed. While the traveler concentrates on his drink, you stay silent thinking about Marina. What might’ve happened. Did she get killed, did she escape, or even if maybe she was turned into a cyborg? You’ll never know you suppose.\n\n“Well, I have to get going. Nice talking to you and hope the CE doesn’t find this place.” The traveler says finishing his drink and getting up to leave.\n\nYou continue remain silent while you reminisce. You wonder if you could’ve done a better job if you’d stayed behind. You do a lot of second guessing for awhile, of course that’s been in your nature in the beginning.\n\nYou didn’t know whether or not you wanted to buy a bomb Shelter, and you were re-thinking the decision that you didn’t. You spent what you thought were going to be your last days with your co-workers and you were re-thinking that decision after you did that. You thought about leaving the Compound several times, before you actually did it and now you’re re-thinking that decision as well.\n\n“Shit, I would’ve made a lousy leader; it takes me forever to make up my mind and then I agonize over the decision.” You say to yourself. Oddly this revelation makes you feel somewhat better, like you did make the right decision to leave.\n\nIf nothing else you’ve at least been able to make good decisions concerning your own survival and you’re about to make another one. You go to the run down motel that you’ve been staying at, and pack your belongings. Its time to move on again, you figure you should get out now while you can.\n\nYou say goodbye to the few acquaintances you’ve had since your time here and warn them about the CE before leaving. It’s up to them what they’re going to do. You can’t make people leave if they don’t want to…even if you want them to.\n\nAnd once again, you’re off, with the unknown future dead ahead of you.\n",

Still it does seem like things are getting worse, late at night when you’re suffering from your usual insomnia, you’ve been catching infomercials attempting to sell bomb shelters, like something out of a 1950s propaganda film. It seems silly, but you do wonder if it’s only a matter of time before someone presses the button.\n\nThen again you live out in the boonies, you’ve always thought that if the world ever did blow up; you’d doubt you’d even notice until you drove to work the next day and saw the ruins of the city.

  "page 148": "This was never anything you ever had in mind, but you’ve come this far, you have made a life here for yourself with Marina; you might as well stick with it. Besides, you’ll be damned if you’ll leave because of Harry.\n\n“Okay. I’ll do it.”\n\nThe Colonel looks relieved. He struggles to get out of bed.\n\n“Alright, I still have some strength left, let’s make this official.”\n\nA meeting is called in the main courtyard where the Colonel weakly addresses everyone, while you stand by. He explains how you’re going to be in charge and he also mentions the “robot invasion” he’s convinced is going to happen. You see Marina in the crowd, who looks very proud and pleased. Harry however is severely pissed and makes it known immediately by confronting the both of you.\n\n“What the fuck is this shit? I’VE been here longer! I’VE been training all these fucking maggots and faggots INCLUDING Cupcake over there!”\n“Yes, and you’ve done a good job of that, but your temperament isn’t suitable for taking command of this place. Besides, I’ve determined that…”\n“FUCK YOU OLD MAN! YOU WILL NOT DENY MY GOD GIVEN RIGHT!” Harry suddenly pulls out his pistol and shoots the Colonel in the stomach. He then tries to shoot you, but you’ve developed more experience than he has in terms of quickness. You pull your own pistol and drill Harry directly between the eyes, dropping him.\n\n“Wish I’d done that to begin with.” You say while Vivica rushes over to the Colonel to try to help him, it’s hopeless though, he was dying anyway. He calls you over one last time.\n\n“…well…I told (cough) you, that you’d probably have to kill him…defend the Combine…follow this man…(cough) he’ll lead you…to victorrrrreeee…”\n\nThe Colonel’s passing is mourned by all, as everyone respected him. A major funeral ceremony is held. It’s probably his last words (and Harry’s shooting) that stabilizes most people’s attitude towards you. They’re willing to follow you, which gives you at least one less thing to worry about.\n\nOf course now you just have to worry about whether or not there is a bunch of robots coming to attack. You decide not to take any chances though and immediately order scouting to be done on the outskirts of the secret base that the Colonel had schematics of. You also order the area around Fort Justice to be heavily trapped along with increased training exercises.\n\nWhen your scouts return, only a couple of them do so, and they’re badly wounded. They confirm the Colonel’s suspicions. There IS an army of robots (though they say most of them are really cyborgs, but that hardly matters) in the area. They’re very organized and heavily armed with high tech weaponry.\n\nWithin a week, the first wave of cyborgs arrive. Surprisingly they give you the option of surrendering and be “remade” to serve the Cybernetic Evolution. You of course decline this offer and fight the steel bastards instead. They’re tough, but your traps ensure you to defeat them much easier. During this time you send a few people to get more help from other Combine towns. You get it for the most part due to large participation in defending most of those towns in the past. You didn’t think about it before, but that might’ve been another reason why the Colonel thought you’d be a better candidate for command, you had a high respect standing with the other towns even if you didn’t initially have it in Fort Justice.\n\nA couple more months pass and you’re assaulted by the second wave. Then again in another few months by a third wave. The cyborgs do a hell of a lot of damage, they breach some of the walls and you lose a lot of people, you’re even heavily scarred in one of the attacks, but yet the Fort still holds and that’s one of your main concerns, you know if the Fort falls that’s it; The Combine will lose this war as the main trained combat force is here. You have to make sure that doesn’t happen.\n\nYou start to notice when the cyborgs retreat they attempt to take away any casualties that you have. In fact you could swear a few of the last few cyborgs you destroyed looked VERY familiar. This gives you the idea that this army is probably a lot more limited in number and not unstoppable. In fact even though they come in great force, it seems to take them awhile to gather up the same force in-between attacks. And while there’s robots mixed in with the cyborgs, they aren’t nearly as numerous. Looks like there’s a shortage and the Cybernetic Evolution needs more warm bodies even more than you do.\n\nIt’s possible that if you just sit tight and defend, you’ll win by sheer attrition, of course you could just finish it quicker by taking the fight to them.\n",
  "page 4": "You’ve never really been a party person, but if this is it, maybe you can have some fun before the end comes. There’s plenty of food and liquids of all kinds at your place of work. The entire office is turned into party central. Nobody bothers going home; it’s actually safer to stay inside the office building anyway since the National Guard is attempting to restore what little order there is in the city. Everyone makes sure to stay away from windows.\n\nEven though you attempt to enjoy yourself, you still have a nagging bit of “concern” for what lies ahead in the future and just can’t quite loosen up completely; you’re about the only one who still bothers to keep up on current events by watching TV and looking at the internet in between non-stop merrymaking. Eventually one of your co-workers Greg walks in on you watching the news by yourself. He’s not exactly what you’d consider a friend, but he’s an acquaintance you normally talked to when you actually did work.\n\n\n“Jesus Christ man! There’s a non-stop party going on and you’re in here wasting time watching TV?” Greg says holding a bottle of beer.\n“I just want to see if the situation has improved…”\n“Are you kidding me? It ain’t improving man! The world’s going to hell in a hand basket, and the sooner you accept that fact the better! Why don’t you go talk to Marina in accounting, didn’t you always have a crush on her or something?”\n“Well yeah, but…”\n“But? But nothing man! There ain’t no time left anymore! Hell I haven’t seen you participate in ONE orgy since you’ve been here!”\n“I dunno, seems unsanitary, I don’t want to catch something, and I don’t want everyone to see me naked.”\n\nGreg puts one of his hands on his face and shakes his head in disbelief of your answer. He then throws his beer bottle into the TV screen breaking them both.\n\n“WAKE THE FUCK UP! This is fuckin’ it man! There ain’t nothing coming after this! We’re all gonna die in a fiery nuclear explosion! You think it’s really gonna matter if in the off chance that you do catch AIDS or some shit, you’ll be alive long enough to die from it? And nobody gives a shit about how small your dick is…”\n“HEY! My dick isn’t small! Its average length for someone of my height!” you protest.\n“Whatever man! Look what I’m trying to say is, everyone is just here to have a good time and grab some pleasure before the nukes start flying, and nobody’s even caring about looks right now. Shit, that fat troll Phil must be getting more action now than he ever has in his entire life! You thought Phil was disgusting looking with his clothes on, he ain’t any prettier with his clothes off, and yet he has banged Kate no less than ten times since we started this Armageddon party and you know how fucking fine she is!”\n“Really? Phil?”\n“I’m telling you man, you NEED to go talk to Marina and get you some of that before the bombs start dropping!”\n\nGreg sees that you’re still a little apprehensive about the idea.\n\n“Fine then, or don’t. It doesn’t matter to me man. I’m going back to the party, I’m not gonna stand here wasting my time talking to you when I could be fucking Kate. I just hope I can get to her before Phil this time.”\n\nGreg leaves you to ponder the situation.\n",
  "page 3": "Fuck work, the world’s about to end soon and you need to prepare yourself for that! You immediately call up the number that the infomercial mentioned. You know the damn thing by heart since you’ve been watching it night after night. Eventually a chipper female voice picks up on the other end.\n\n\n“Ground Zero Survival Inc. How may I help you?”\n“Uh, yeah I’d like to buy a bomb shelter.”\n“That’s wonderful sir! In these uncertain times you can never be too careful and we here at GZS are thrilled that you’ve chosen to trust us in your continued existence! You and your family’s utmost protection is as important to us is it is to you! Our shelters are the best you’ll find and, we have many shelters still available at various prices, but really can you put a price on your loved ones protection? Of course not! So I’m sure you’ll want one of our top of the line models that are still left! Okay so how many are in your family?”\n“Um, just me.”\n“Oh…” the voice suddenly gets less chipper.\n“What?”\n“Sir, don’t you have ANY family? Like a wife at least, maybe a cousin?”\n“No, not really.”\n“Oh dear…”\n“WHAT!?”\n“Well sir, its just that, we here at GZS are a family friendly business and we feel that the survival of the human race will best be served by those who have a strong sense of family ties and a respect for the family unit. We aren’t in the business of selling shelters to those of low moral fiber sir…”\n“What the fuck?! Just because I’m single I gotta be some sort of low life? I’m not luring fuckin’ little girls into my car with lollipops! I have a fucking job and pay my goddamn taxes!”\n“Sir, I don’t like you taking that tone with me when there isn’t any call for it and I would appreciate it if you didn’t blaspheme, I’m a God fearing woman. Now then I understand your frustration, but there’s nothing we can do. Our shelters were primarily built for families of at least four. To put singles in them wouldn’t be fair to families that have children who shall surely be the ones to rebuild civilization, not to mention it would be a waste of resources. A single person would have an overstock of food and water since as I said we primarily cater to families and stock the shelters with families in mind.”\n“I fail to see how me having MORE than enough food and water is a bad thing…”\n“I see sir, so you would be selfish and deprive a possible family of survival?”\n“I didn’t say that! And wait a minute; wouldn’t I be doing that anyway if I had a family of my own?”\n“Yes, but it would be different.”\n“How?”\n“You would have a family sir.”\n\nYou’re about ready to throw the phone against the wall in frustration.\n\n“So basically what you’re telling me is you’re not selling me a shelter.”\n“Ah now I didn’t say that sir! Since you’re interested in buying our product and by your previous outburst I can tell you ARE a productive member of society. And it is only due to your poor social skills that you have been unable to take the necessary steps to have a family of your own! But never fear, GZS HAS kept your type in mind!”\n“Gee, thanks…”\n“You’re quite welcome sir! We have the Community Shelters for singles! It is basically a giant shelter filled with singles such as yourself. You will be given a separate room to live in, but everything else you must share. Don’t worry we have stocked these shelters with supplies to last for years! It is our hope that nature will take its course and when it comes time to return to the surface a fully functional tight knit community of families will emerge to rebuild civilization once again!”\n\nSharing isn’t something you’re good at. You like your privacy and your space and your solitude. You can’t imagine sharing stuff when your very survival is at stake.\n\n“Look, don’t you have ANYTHING I can get by myself?” you demand.\n“Are you serious sir? You actually want to be alone?” the voice says as if you must be nuts to ask that kind of question.\n“If possible yeah.”\n“Well…I shouldn’t really tell you sir, because you snapped at me earlier, but it is my job to make sure any potential customer is serviced to the best of my ability. That and the fact that these other Special Shelters we have are a bit…experimental.”\n“Experimental? What do you mean?”\n“Well I don’t know too much about these Special Shelters myself sir, all I know is they have been equipped with the latest technology and VERY expensive. Anyone can buy one as long as they have the money to do so.”\n“Well how experimental are these things exactly?”\n“As I said sir, I know little about these Special Shelters other than they are equipped with the latest technology. GZS has run tests and they are considered very safe and will protect you in the coming apocalypse, however due to time constraints GZS may have missed a few minor things, and as such we are legally required to warn…er inform potential customers before they buy them.”\n",
  "page 9": "Greg’s right. This IS it! This is no time to be playing it safe! The world is going to end any day and damn it you’re going to fucking LIVE life for the first time! You immediately get up and make your way to the main office area; it looks like you’re just in time for another orgy. Greg is getting ready to stick it to Kate just like he said…that is until you smash the back of his head in with a stapler until he’s bloody and unconscious…or dead. You’re not sure and you don’t really care anymore.\n\n“You were right…man.” You say breathing hard.\n\nYour actions cause people to stop in shock, then you grab Kate who’s completely naked and worried about what you’re going to do next.\n\n“Come here you little fucking whore, you like being a fucking fuck slut? I’ll treat you like one then!” you utter viciously.\n\nYou proceed to bend Kate over the copy machine, pull her hair and fuck the hell out of her calling her every derogatory name in the book. The weird thing is she starts to like it. She even starts taunting you back saying you can’t fuck worth a shit. This of course only makes you slap her around a bit more. You both are really getting into it.\n\nAfter watching this spontaneous act of S\u0026M/Rape everyone goes back to doing what they were doing. From then on in, Kate hangs around you a lot more (Much to Phil’s dismay) and you forget all about Marina, in fact you don’t even see her in the whole time during this Armageddon party. You indulge in carnal delights like you never had before.\n\nUntil one day…\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up from the floor; Kate’s lying beside you asleep. There are sleeping naked bodies everywhere. Yesterday’s orgy was a dozy, someone broke open a couple bags of coke they’d been saving and everyone had a snort. Can’t say you liked it though, your head fucking hurts, you keep hearing a fucking ring…\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE….”\n\nThen you realize it’s not in your head, it’s an actual ring from another TV that was left on. There’s a test pattern on it.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou put your clothes back on and give Kate a quick kiss, which causes her to smile a little in her sleep. You wonder if you would’ve actually had a shot with her if things had been normal, oh well you guess you’ll never know.\n\nYou quietly make your way through the room and head up to the top floor and onto the roof of the building. The city is deadly quiet. You don’t hear a sound except the wind gently blowing. In all the revelry you’ve been indulging in, you forgot how much you liked the solitude and silence.\n\nThe loneliness is peaceful.\n\nYou look up in the sky, shielding your eyes from the sun shining down.\n\nYou see a bright light and then nothing at all.\n",
  "page 91": "You throw your hands up.\n\n“Alright, fuck it then. You’re right. What the hell do I care? Shoulda been more careful Ron.”\n\nYou turn around and go back to the computer room to send the elevator up, you hear the pitiful begging from Ron, followed up by a couple of verbal abusive insults from Nina. Sheesh, she’s turned into a real bitch. You better make yourself semi-useful so that vengeful attitude doesn’t turn too much on you. You figure the best way to do that is to start monitoring and working with the GZS central computer, besides you need to look after this thing anyway. You don’t feel safe with those other two idiots looking after it.\n\n“(Sigh) Looks like I’m working again.” You say as you press the button to send the elevator up.\n\nFour years pass...\n\nYou’ve been here five years and things have changed.\n\nThe population has grown a bit, but not a lot since Nina’s pettiness helps keep the population down. Nina, has thrown at least ten people into “exile”. Anyone who only mildly displeases or disagrees with her, is often shown the elevator…unless they happen to be providing a useful skill like you. Nina really hates the fact that you’re the only competent technician she has. You manage to keep things from breaking down constantly like they were, but only just the minimum. You purposely don’t keep things running at maximum efficiency, since as long as you’re needed you won’t be in danger…of course there IS the fact you have a gun that also keeps you safe, but there’s never any harm in having a couple of safety nets. The more the better.\n\nIn fact, you wonder about losing one of your safety nets. Todd and Charles have increased in their technical knowledge over the years, and granted they still aren’t as skilled as you; they might actually be competent one day. And they do a lot less back talking than you…\n\n\nYou wonder if you should do something to ensure your position. Todd and Charles come in talking about some old movie they watched in the community living area. It would be really easy to just shoot them. Who would stop you? And what could anyone do about it?\n",
  "page 93": "Oh well, you were never that close to them anyway…\n\n\nYou reach for your weapon, while Todd and Charles are still talking. You blast Charles in the neck making blood spurt all over Todd who stares in shock. Your next shot hits Todd in the head.\n\nWith both of them dead you suddenly feel a whole lot better and go back to work. Naturally the sound of the shots brings people to come running.\n\n“OH NO! HE’S DONE IT AGAIN!” someone shouts and runs back out of the room. Pretty soon Nina and her goon Leon come in. Nina sees the two bodies on the floor and looks more pissed off than afraid of you.\n\n“What the fuck did you do that for?”\n“Just ensuring my position Nina, I’m sure you understand.”\n“You fucking psychotic sonofabitch! You can’t just go around shooting people!”\n“Oh don’t EVEN be claiming moral superiority here Nina, you who throws people into Exile just because they’re looking at you funny! In fact Todd and Charles deaths are your fault not mine, I can’t help if I feel threatened that you might replace me and throw me out on to the surface as well.”\n“Goddamn you, if you didn’t have that gun or the only reliable tech, I’d throw you out of here so fast…”\n“Exactly! So I’m glad we’re in agreement…it’s all your fault.”\n“What the…look, just because you got that fuckin’ gun doesn’t mean shit! I’M still in charge of this place!”\n\nYou stand up and shoot Leon three times, he falls backwards smacking his head against a table before taking his last breath. Now Nina starts to get worried, you just shot her head goon who was intimidating everyone else. She doesn’t have that leverage anymore. Of course right now she’s not worried about staying in power, for the first time she’s worried about you shooting her. You’re up close and personal, threatening her with it.\n\n“See that Nina? What the fuck are ya gonna do now? Who are ya gonna get to throw people into exile? In case you haven’t realized it yet, but I’M in fuckin’ charge of this goddamn place! I just let you think you are! Now I suggest you take your ass outta here and try to figure out how you’re gonna stay in power. Because I’m sure there’s a lot of people not fond of you either, but unlike me they can actually do something about you.\nGuess I know who’ll be the next exile! Ha Ha!” you then lick Nina’s face.\n\nNina backs out of the room in a hurry, leaving you alone with a room full of dead bodies.\n\n“Get up, you lazy fucks, we got work to do!” you say kicking Todd’s body in a macabre joke to yourself.\n\n Perhaps stepping over the line of killing Todd and Charles with no provocation unhinged you a bit. And killing Leon certainly put you over the edge. Granted Nina’s no saint, but what you’re doing is just as bad. You kind of got a power rush, from your deeds today and you must say you really liked it.\n\nAfter making sure everything’s working properly and even increasing the efficiency a bit, you decide to call it a day at the computer room. You leave stepping over the bodies that nobody’s come to clean up yet.\n\n“Well, if you’re still here, I guess I’ll see you guys tomorrow.” You say.\n\nYou make your way back to your room. The corridors seem to be clear of folks, probably afraid of all the stuff that went down today so they’re keeping their heads down. Good.\n\nBefore you get ready to go to sleep, you get a knock on the door, you answer it, ready to shoot someone else again, but see Nina in her underwear instead. You’re a little surprised.\n\n“Nina, what the hell are you doing?” unsure of how to respond.\n\nNina begins to talk in a way you’ve never heard her speak before, seductive, yet vulnerable.\n\n“I was doing some thinking like you said back in the computer room…and you’re right. I won’t hold anymore power here anymore…I’ll probably get thrown onto the surface like you said…unless I ally myself with someone who has power, and you’re the only one with that kind of power.”\n“I see, so what does this conclusion you’ve come to mean exactly?”\n\nNina takes your hand and puts it on her body, starting with her firm breasts and moving it lower to the promised land.\n\n“It means I’m yours, in everyway imaginable, every night, any time, just please don’t let anything happen to me.”\n\nNina then nuzzles up against you and begins kissing on you gently for further enticement in her desperate plan to save herself.\n\nIt’s a bit hard to resist her offer. In more ways than one. This reminds you of those prison movies where one of them offers to be the bitch in exchange for protection, except this is better because Nina’s female!\n",
  "page 92": "Something comes over you, maybe it was the tension or the hostility or maybe you were just horny, but you grab Nina and kiss her passionately. Fortunately for you, she returns the gesture. Now nobody knows what to think they all just stand around watching, they’re probably just glad you didn’t shoot anybody this time. William and Ron are still recovering from their beating and staggering in the doorway of the elevator.\n\nNina stops you just for a moment to address everyone. “The exile is off, everyone go back to your lives…and YOU are coming with me!” then she starts pulling you back to her room.\n\nYou and Nina relieve a lot of pent up sexual energy that day. A lot of things change after that…\n\n\nFour more years pass...\n\nYou and Nina are an item now, which makes you somewhat more social by necessity (unfortunately) its not all bad though since she’s the one that’s still shelter leader and has to do all the major work. She does a good job hence the reason she’s stayed in power. (Though not surprisingly William and Ron still vote against her, even if she did apologize)\n\nYou’re now in charge of maintaining the central GZS computer system which you insist on doing primarily by yourself, though Charles and Todd assist you sometimes. Eventually you manage to get the damn thing running at near maximum efficiency and nobody has too many problems with things breaking down anymore.\n\nThe Shelter’s population has grown a bit now; the only good thing about the shelter was the design to make allowances for a population growth. Of course now there’s rug rats running around which means Nina appoints a person to start being a “teacher” of sorts for when they start getting bigger. Fortunately there are a couple of those already in the shelter. Kyle and Brenda are now the main medical practitioners, though you doubt if they’d be able to do open heart surgery, they’re competent enough to keep people in relatively good shape and they keep trying to learn more whenever possible with the medical database provided and from books. (You still don’t understand WHY you’re the only competent tech though! “Gah! Read the books! Study the schematics! It’s not difficult!” you’re constantly saying and that’s to Charles and Todd!)\n\nThen there’s the elevator. After the near exile incident, it was still considered a good idea to have it accessible at all times just in case. What you eventually did was install a call button and did some re-wiring to do just that, though nobody has ever dared to actually go up to the surface. (And nobody’s ever gotten thrown out either)\n\nYou begin to wonder what the surface looks like now though from time to time.\n\nOne night while lying next to Nina…\n\n“Hey Nina, you ever wonder what’s on the surface now?”\n“What? It’s probably an uninhabitable wasteland.”\n“Well maybe, but we’ve been down here five years, it might look different.”\n“Yeah, and it might not. Go back to sleep.”\n“You know I just thought about it, everyone’s vehicles are up there. I bet we could strip them down for parts or something, maybe some of them will even work. We could drive around and see what’s going on else where.”\n“What? I don’t want you going up there! The elevator is a last resort thing just case something bad happens! And since when do you want to play great explorer? When you first got here you never left your room!”\n“I dunno, maybe your socialization has made me a little more extroverted.”\n“Hmm, knowing you, you probably just want to get away from the increasing population here.”\n“Ha ha, maybe. But I still wouldn’t mind just taking a quick look outside, and to inspect the vehicles like I said.”\n\nNina now sits up.\n\n“No! I don’t want you going up there! There’s probably radiation still all over the place! I don’t want you getting radiation poisoning or mutating or something!”\n“I’ll be fine! I won’t go too far, I just want to…”\n\nNina grabs a hold of your hand.\n\n“NO! I don’t want you going up there! It’s not safe!”\n“Alright, alright, calm down. I won’t go anywhere.”\n“You promise?”\n“Yeah!”\n“Alright then, I don’t want to hear anymore about it. Our life is here, not up there. I love you too much to lose you.”\n\nThe both of you lie back down, and Nina holds on to you tightly, putting her head on your chest almost in an effort to make sure you’re not going anywhere tonight.\n\nOf course now you’re lying awake REALLY wondering what the surface looks like.\n\nThe next day you’re working with Charles and Todd doing the usual mundane routine. They’re talking about the same stupid movie they’ve watched over and over in the community living area. Shit you feel like you’re at work again. The GZS central computer hasn’t been giving you trouble for quite some time, and you know there’s a big meeting going on in the conference room…\n\nMaybe you could sneak out and just take a quick look on the surface for awhile. You could let Charles and Todd look after the computer, you know they’re capable of doing that.\n",
  "page 94": "Man, you MUST be going half-nuts down here. You can’t believe you just considered killing two people just on a paranoid delusion. You begin to start seriously analyzing your behavior.\n\nOkay, killing Elliot was in self defense. You didn’t really have a choice. You were even defending this place, he didn’t seem like he had good plans for the shelter and its inhabitants.\n\nSending Ron and William into exile wasn’t your fault…well not really. You were just obeying goddamn orders. You tried to talk Nina out of it when nobody else had the balls to stand up to her. She wasn’t budging. What the fuck were you supposed to do? Shoot her, like you were just thinking about shooting Charles and Todd just a few moments ago?\n\nYou just wanted to be fuckin’ left alone, now you’re roped into all this shit that you don’t really want to be part of. You’re NOT a bad guy, hell you’re keeping this shelter from falling into ruin!\n\n“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU PEOPLE WANT FROM ME?!!?!” you yell.\n\nCharles and Todd look at each other wondering what you’re talking about.\n\n“Uh…nothing. In fact we weren’t even talking to you.” Todd says.\n“Are you alright? You’ve been spacing out and day dreaming a lot lately.” Charles adds as you suddenly realize your surroundings.\n“I…I gotta get outta this place.”\n“Well, that’s cool I mean you do seem like you need to lie down and rest or something. We can look after…”\n“NO Todd! I mean I gotta leave THIS place! The fuckin’ shelter!”\n“You mean go to the surface? Are you crazy?” Charles asks.\n“I’m gettin’ there and know I can’t stay here any longer, or I’m gonna go fuckin’ full blown crazy and shoot somebody else!”\n\nCharles and Todd both back off.\n\n“Hey on the other hand maybe leaving is a good idea!”\n\nYou tell Todd and Charles you’re going to pack some supplies and as much water as you can carry and that all you want them to do, is to send the elevator up for you. They don’t have a problem with it, they tell you just to come back and let them know when you’re ready.\n\nYou go back to your room and load up on water and that crap they call “food” from the dispensers. Then you enter the medical room and begin taking medical supplies. When you think you’re ready, you go back and tell Todd and Charles. Charles opens the elevator door and wishes you luck, Todd talks to you on your way there.\n\n“So you sure about this?”\n“Very sure, in fact I’m not sure why more people aren’t wanting to leave with Nina bullying everyone.”\n\nSpeak of the devil. Nina arrives with her goon Leon. Shit, you were hoping to avoid this.\n\n“What’s all this about me being a bully? And where the fuck do you think you’re going?” Nina exclaims.\n“I’m leaving Nina, you of all people should be happy about it, I won’t be around to piss you off anymore or threaten your power.”\n“Well as much as I’d like you to leave, I admit you’re needed here so I’m afraid I can’t let you leave and even if you were to leave I can’t just let you take vital shelter supplies! Go put those back and get back to your post NOW!”\n“Nina, you’re not calling the fuckin’ shots on this, I’m going! I’m not you’re goddamn prisoner! And if the rest of you are smart the rest of these people would stop cowering before you. But hey what do I know?”\n\nYou start to enter the elevator, and Nina makes another threat.\n\n“Don’t you DARE walk away from me! You go in that elevator and don’t expect to get to the top! I’ll make sure it gets stopped mid-way through and leave it there for you to die a slow death!”\n\nYou step back out and hang your head down.\n\n“(Sigh) You WOULD do that wouldn’t you?”\n“You bet your ass I would!”\n“Well I guess I have no choice.”\n\nYou look up at Nina, raise your pistol and blast Leon twice in the chest and then point it at her. Onlookers slowly rise from their hiding spots\n\n“Holy shit!” Todd shouts.\n“Please don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” Nina whines\n“Gonna be hard to intimidate Charles or Todd without your head goon now isn’t it? In fact I’d say your power trip is just about over. Hey folks, consider this my last favor to all of you! Alright Todd, tell Charles I’m going up!”\n\nYou enter the elevator and begin your ascent. Finally the elevator opens up to the same foyer you entered five years ago. Looks exactly the same, except the payment machine is now offline in fact the screen is cracked. There’s a crowbar lying on the floor and the doors to the outside look like they were pried open. You see the outside world for the first time in five years. From where you’re standing, it doesn’t look too bad; maybe the devastation wasn’t that great in this area. Somebody or possibly several people were here at one time attempting to get in, you laugh thinking about someone actually trying to get in this place.\n\nYou exit the foyer and go outside, you see a bright light. It’s the sun; you forgot how bright it could be. You see everyone’s cars still parked here, well almost. You can tell that few of them must’ve been taken at one time; a lot have just been plain vandalized. Your van still looks the same though, nobody in their right mind would steal that thing, and it already looks vandalized. You wonder if it would still start, but you left your keys to it in the shelter. You doubt if it would though.\n\n“Meh, I need the exercise anyway.”\n\nYou cover your eyes and take a far view of your position. Nobody around, there’s not even a sound except the wind; you’re all alone as far as you can tell and this is what you missed. Once again you have peaceful solitude.\n\nYou begin to walk…\n",
  "page 97": "You push her away; you’re not fooled by this act.\n\n\n“Nina, maybe your feminine wiles worked on Leon, but that shit ain’t gonna work on me, I know what the fuck you’re up to. You think I’m gonna let you distract me and let you grab my pistol while we’re fucking? Not fucking likely!”\n\n\nNina attempts to continue with her tactic and gets next to you again.\n\n\n“No, I’m serious. I want your protection. I wouldn’t try to betray you…”\n\n“Oh, okay. You’re serious eh? We’ll see.”\n\n\nYou pull Nina in the room and lock the door. You then take your pistol, unload it, and then put it on the far side of the room. Nina’s face looks little less “in the mood” now.\n\n\n“Alright, let’s go then.” You say.\n\n“Uh…”\n\n“What’s the matter? Plan backfire? Too late for regrets now, now we can either do this voluntarily or INvoluntarily…and on the path I’ve been going lately I think you know that I’m fully capable of doing it. Pfft. I don’t need a gun for you. So, what’s it gonna be Nina?”\n\n\nNina looks around, probably looking for something to throw at you, but she realizes that it would probably be in vain. She’s obviously scared, but still tries to maintain some bravery in this hopeless situation that you’ve put her in.\n\n\n“Alright…but don’t hurt me.”\n\n\nYour increasingly chaotic personality changes again and you go up to Nina in a “loving” fashion.\n\n\n“Aw baby, I won’t hurt you. Just know your place and I’ll take care of you, I promise.”\n\n\nYou fuck Nina eight ways from doomsday that night. You can’t speak for Nina, but you know YOU enjoyed yourself. The only absolute positive for Nina is that she IS now under your protection and nobody dares to do anything to her now.\n\n\nA few months pass and you keep expecting her to try to do something to betray you, but nothing happens. Either she’s resigned herself to being “yours” or she’s content on taking her aggression out on others. Her time with you doesn’t make her any more compassionate to others, if anything she’s gotten worse. She doesn’t threaten people with exile anymore, now she just threatens them with you.\n\n\nMeanwhile you begin to slowly descend into a sociopathic personality. The only thing that prevents you from shooting everyone is the fact that you’re getting off on their fear a lot more than if you killed them. You keep the computer room locked so only you may access it.\n\n\nYou and her are pretty much running the place now.\n\n\nFive more years pass…\n\n\nThe shelter is a living nightmare to most people. They live in constant fear that you or Nina will do something to them. Nina has developed a twisted sort of love for you, and while you have a certain fondness for her, you don’t really give a shit about anything anymore, you barely even keep the computer working right anymore, now you just make sure your room is running properly. Nina is a permanent fixture at your place, so you don’t even need to look after her room even if you were inclined to do so.\n\n\nWhile the people were living in fear of you, initially you were at least somewhat looking after their welfare, but now you aren’t even doing that. Now the fear turns into hatred and resentment. The cowering worms have evolved to grow spines. They begin devising a plan.\n\n\nOne day Nina gets into a cat fight with another woman, Greta. She beats her pretty badly, until her husband Fred steps in and begins beating the hell out of her. As is typical Nina runs off to tell you, at which point you come out of the computer room ready to shoot someone. Fred stands up to you, and says Nina was the one who started it and he was just protecting his wife as if his explanation means anything to you.\n\n\n“Duly noted. And I understand your view, but as you must be able to see I have a view of things as well…that’s a nice kid you got there.”\n\n\nYou shoot Fred and Greta’s son right before their eyes. Greta screams and Fred lunges at you, causing you to shoot him as well, but not before he tackles you to the floor. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity, a few other bystanders take advantage of the situation, your sole means of power and intimidation is taken from you, as you are kicked and beaten repeatedly. Nina is treated the same way. Suddenly the beatings stop and as you attempt to get up you feel the barrel against your head. You spit a glob of blood before continuing.\n\n\n \n\n“Ha ha, go ahead shit eater. Pop me and they’ll be nobody to run the computer the right way.”\n\n“We’ll get by.” a voice says.\n\n\nYou then are shot twice in the back of the head. Nina’s fate follows soon after. Your remaining ammo is used to shoot both of your dead bloody bodies until it’s all gone.\n",
  "page 96": "You don’t think about it, you don’t answer; you let your actions speak. You pull her inside and close the door while she continues to kiss on you. As she kisses on your chest you begin pushing her head lower. She gets on her knees and begins servicing you like a common whore.\n\nAfter you reach your climax, she insists that she’s not done and wants to show you even more of what she’s capable of tonight. You and her fall back to the bed where she slips off her panties, mounts you and begins the second round.\n\nIn the throes of love making while you’re closing your eyes saying “Ride the horse baby! Ride the fuckin’ horse!”  you climax again, and when you open them, you get a nasty surprise of your own fucking gun being pointed at your face.\n\n“Raise your fuckin’ hands motherfucker!” she says calmly. You comply.\n“Whoa! Hold on! Don’t shoot! Weren’t we just having fun?”\n“Maybe you were, but this was just a means to an end for me…I fully intend on scrubbing myself thoroughly after this, the fact that you came inside me twice sickens me.”\n“Okay, just settle down Nina, I know you’re a little upset about what I did earlier today, but I wasn’t actually going to hurt you. Just got a little trigger happy that’s all! I dunno I’ve been under a lot of stress lately! I…”\n”SHUT UP! You ain’t talkin’ your way outta this! This is about survival and being in control!”\n\nSensing nothing else to lose you become threatening.\n\n“Oh yeah? Well fuck you! Because I’M still in fuckin’ control then! Without me nobody knows how to run the goddamn computer the right way! I’m fuckin’ necessary to your fuckin’ survival, you stupid bitch!”\n“I’m nobody’s bitch! Especially not yours!”\n\nBefore you can retort to that remark, Nina blows your brains out.\n",
  "page 271": "The Cybernetic Evolution’s opinion of mutants probably isn’t much better than their opinion of humans. This is probably a scouting force to assess the defenses and resistance level here, well to hell with that you aren’t going to let them report shit. You immediately open fire. You kill the smaller one in the center with relative ease, but the others go into battle mode and start laying down the firepower. You nearly get yourself killed before managing to take cover.\n\n\nOther mutants hear the sounds of battle and rush to the area to help you, and soon the metal interlopers are a pile of sparking scrap.\n\n“What the hell, you find new enemies for us?” one of the mutants asks you.\n“Nah, I don’t think we’ll be having any more problems with them. They’re busy with a war with the Combine; I doubt an army of cyborgs will be coming here anytime soon. Better go report this to the Captain though.”\n\nSoon after the cyborg diversion a lot of rumors start flying around that the Cybernetic Evolution will be attempting to invade Zeropolis or even that they’ve somehow allied with the Shadow Horde, but none of these rumors even come true. Though it does make Captain Salazar paranoid enough to take the current war with the Shadow Horde more on the offensive, of course this doesn’t pan out too well.\n\nWhen Salazar starts sending troops into the actual sewers they’re at a severe disadvantage and the losses on your side are terrible, yet the Captain insists on carrying out this plan.\n\nA few years go by and the Dust District’s defenses are nearly completely destroyed. You’re one of last defenders left and the Zeropolis Guard no longer exists as you know it. After Captain Salazar was struck down by an assassin the organization dissolved and it just became a bunch of armed mutants trying to defend their homes.\n\nIt’s a futile endeavor though the Shadow Horde is relentless and as much as you might hate it, you have to leave; it’s just simply not safe to stay where you are anymore. The question is where to go?\n\nThere are probably other places in the City where the Shadow Horde isn’t as strong or even in control, but that might just be a temporary solution and it might not be any safer. The only other option is to leave the City which is certainly going to be dangerous as you know mutants aren’t looked upon too kindly.\n",
  "page 152": "You’re unwilling to risk more lives and so decide to just shore up your defenses.\n\nAnother couple of months pass and a much smaller group of cyborgs arrive which confirms your ideas that they’re running out of troops. One thing that’s a little strange is that they don’t immediately attack, they just make their presence known while attempting to stay out of the way of your snipers. They also make some “raiding” like attacks on anyone trying to leave the Fort to travel anywhere. They never directly attack the fort though.\n\nThese annoying raids go on for a year, until you get sick of them and finally decide you need to get rid of these things once and for all. You order a concentrated attack on all the cyborg raiders in the area, after a few weeks it’s confirmed that they’ve all been eliminated. Afterwards you send a scouting force to the secret base, to see if that’s the end of this cybernetic thorn in your side.\n\nA week passes and you don’t hear anything from your scouts. You curse and figure the cyborgs still have enough troops to defend their own base, but the truth is much worse as you come to find out.\n\nA week after you sent your scout team, a new cyborg army appears within the sight of Fort Justice. Better improved looking this time too. Obviously while you were playing around with the cyborgs raiding you, someone else was upgrading and gathering more “recruits” from elsewhere while you still haven’t replenished your own losses from last year…\n\nAnother battle is joined, but this time not in your favor. The fort is destroyed and in flames. Soon people are either, running, killed or captured. In the chaos of Fort Justice’s final days, one of those you see captured is Marina as a big cyborg drags away her unconscious wounded body.\n\nYou desperately try to rescue her, but your head is completely incinerated by its high powered laser beam as soon as your bullets fail to penetrate its armor. Your headless carcass falls to the ground and left to burn up with the rest of Fort Justice.\n\nWithin the year, the Combine is no more and only the Cybernetic Evolution remains to continue its mission.\n",
  "page 273": "You gather your belongings and leave as quickly as possible to another part of Zeropolis. It’s a big city after all; surely you can find some place to be.\n\nEventually you do find a place to settle down. It isn’t the safest, but it’s better than where you currently were. Though in time, it begins to get dangerous once again as the Shadow Horde turns its attention to other parts of the City, and you have to move again, you continue this routine for a few more years until one day your luck runs out and you fail to leave in time and you finally become a victim to the ever growing Shadow Horde.\n",
  "page 151": "In these past few months you’ve actually been fighting for something. Not just “following orders” or “going through the motions”. You haven’t even been doing it for mere survival, if you were interested in just survival, you would’ve just taken off and put as much distance as you could between you and the Combine before the cyborgs appeared. It took awhile, but you finally have a sense of purpose. You finally “got” all that shit Marina was talking about. Rebuilding civilization and all that. The Cybernetic Evolution is a real threat to that ever happening. It needs to be stopped here and now while it’s weak.\n\nYou get organized first and muster ALL the help you can from the rest of the Combine towns. This includes a bit of conscription from them and puts somewhat of a strain on relations and general feelings. Many think the war is “won” and you can just sit back and defend now, but you know you need to press the Cybernetic Evolution now before they “recruit” elsewhere and just attack you again and maybe successfully. Enthusiasm isn’t exactly the highest, but you have proven to be a successful military leader so the people are willing to put up with your orders.\n\nThe assault on the Cyborg Base occurs and it is not easy. The location and rough terrain prevents most vehicles you might’ve used in the assault to get close. The siege lasts months the losses are horrendous, and there’s a point where people are really starting to question your leadership. However before a revolt in the Combine occurs, the Cyborg Base is breached and the topside is taken.\n\nThe base’s second level is easily accessed and the war is nearly at an end. Finally the leader of the Cybernetic Evolution is cornered and unceremoniously blown to bits by a grenade while he was trying to hide in one of the rooms. Oddly he wasn’t a robot or even a cyborg. He was merely a human with megalomania, in fact after some investigation; it was the Colonel’s old “friend” Alex.\n\nThe threat to the Combine is at an end, but the threat OF the Combine is just beginning…\n\nEven though you were the one who orchestrated the defeat of the Cybernetic Evolution and probably saved not only the Combine, but the hope of humanity with your actions somehow a lot of people aren’t all that grateful. They only see the immediate loss that was suffered rather than the larger picture. Fort Justice is of course firmly still under your control as well as the newly acquired cyborg base, but most of the other towns are wanting out of the Combine saying that you’re being a dictator.\n",
  "page 272": "You wonder if you’ve lost your mind again, because you can’t believe you’re even considering this…\n\n“Hey! Uh, hello! This is Zeropolis Guard territory! What do you want?” you call out to the group of cyborgs. One of them briefly talks to its heavier armed brethren and then steps forward to meet you; it’s a female, mostly human looking cyborg. She’s sort of cute, well cuter than what you’re used to around here anyway.\n\n\n\n“Yes, greetings. I am AVA-93, former human remade, emissary prototype, from the Cybernetic Evolution.” She says unemotionally.\n“Prototype?”\n“Yes, I am one of a kind. The Cybernetic Evolution typically does not believe in wasting time with words. We prefer a more direct course of action as we are attempting to remake humanity to a higher state of evolution.”\n“I see…so what purpose do you serve then since you guys tend to shoot first and ask questions later?”\n“Why to make contact with you mutants of course. The Cybernetic Evolution is currently at war with a human organization called the Combine. They refuse to see the light, are a committed foe and greatly outnumber us. So we must find every means available to defeat them. We have heard that mutants are victims of human prejudices and that you are typically shot on sight when found outside the City.”\n“Well I suppose you could say that, though I can sort of see why they might be suspicious of us, many of us aren’t exactly friendly types.”\n“Yes, I have heard that most mutants are completely hostile, I am surprised to see the amount of organization you have shown as I thought this was not the case.”\n“Around here, we’re the exception rather than the norm, so what did you have in mind?”\n“An alliance of course. We would like you to help us destroy The Combine.”\n“Whoa, hold on there. I’m not exactly in charge of this place; you’ll have to talk with Captain Salazar, as he runs the Zeropolis Guard. There’s also the fact that we’re in a war ourselves with a group of mutants that outnumber us, we wouldn’t be able to help much. Then there’s the whole fact…”\n\nYou hesitate, but AVA-93 demands that you continue.\n\n“Yes?”\n“Well there’s that fact that if you’re trying remake humans into cyborgs, what happens after you defeat all the humans? Will you try to remake us as well?”\n“A thoughtful question. At the present time, you mutants are not suitable candidates for remaking, though what the future holds is unknown. However you can be rest assured that if we ally we will never attack you as long as we are at war with The Combine.”\n\nThat answer doesn’t really make you want to suddenly be their friend, though it was an honest answer. The only thing you can think of is let Captain Salazar decide how he wants to handle this, so you take AVA and the rest to see him.\n\nDuring the talks Salazar doesn’t seem very concerned about what might happen in the future so much as what an alliance can do for him now. AVA mentions that they can supply him with their own high tech weapons to help in the war with the Shadow Horde, if the Zeropolis Guard starts raiding nearby Combine towns. He immediately agrees, and AVA leaves explaining that the first shipment will arrive as soon in the mean time they want an attack launched on the Combine immediately.\n\nYou advise strongly against this course of action. The Shadow Horde hasn’t even been attacking in large groups like it once did. You don’t like the idea of fighting a two front war and spreading your strength so thin, and you still don’t like the idea of allying with a bunch of cyborgs with a superiority complex. Salazar doesn’t want to hear it though; his vendetta against the Shadow Horde is too great. He wants them gone and is willing to do anything for the chance. In fact he’s pissed off at you for advising against it, so he says he’s sending YOU along with a few others to start attacking the Combine towns!\n\nYou leave Zeropolis for the first time in five years; it’s very odd to you. Everything seems different, like cleaner. Even the air seems fresher. You almost feel like you don’t belong here anymore, the others traveling with you feel the same way. Soon you approach a nearby town; of course you stay away for awhile plotting of how to approach this situation.\n\nOver the course of a few months you organize successful raids on Combine towns, mostly at night, taking advantage of your night vision. (Which seems perfect at this point)\nWhile you do feel superior to them, you don’t have any particular hatred for humans; this is just job to you, nothing more. You don’t have too much resistance for the most part. Most of the Combine force is holding off the Cybernetic Evolution. But you do lose people under your command, some through the attacks, but some due to being called back to Zeropolis. Apparently the Captain is having a lot more difficulty than he thought when he started sending troops down into the sewers to take the fight to the Shadow Horde. Eventually you’re all by yourself! In fact you’re wondering why Captain Salazar hasn’t called you back since you’re his second in command, you know he was pissed at you, but if he’s calling everyone else back, why not you?\n\nAt this point you can’t even really do too much, except maybe hang out in the wilderness sniping the occasional Combine citizen or soldier. In fact given this situation, you get the feeling he’s pretty much abandoned you.\n\nMaybe you should just leave. It’s not like you couldn’t survive out here. Your time in Zeropolis has made you better in everyway. You could even withstand long periods of food and water if need be. (Though lately you’ve been eating the mutant wildlife and drinking their blood to sustain you, so it isn’t really a problem)\n",
  "page 154": "Once again, you think back to that town of Lost Springs that didn’t want to be part of the Combine, and you thought then “If they don’t want your help, they don’t want your help.”\n\nMaybe they’re calling you a dictator, but you know if that were true you’d enforce your will upon all of them. No, you’re not going to do that.\n\nOne by one the towns disband from the Combine. You still remain in control of Fort Justice and the newly acquire Cyborg Base, but “The Combine” as you know it is no more. One might even call it a Pyrrhic victory, however you do not.\n\nYou saved civilization and humanity from a threat that might not have been stopped otherwise. Maybe you aren’t going to be recognized for it, but then again some good deeds aren’t recognized. Sometimes Marina thinks it’s incredibly unfair of how you’ve been labeled, but you take it all in stride and always tell her after kissing her…\n\n“It was worth it.”\n\nYears pass and you remain in control of Fort Justice and Base Victory, you never experience any more real threats mainly due to the superior high tech weaponry that was acquired when Base Victory was taken. Expansion is never seriously considered again however stable relations with towns are re-established eventually when they start having raider problems again. Many of your citizens hire themselves out as mercenaries in exchange for goods that are needed and to make a living. Indeed the “Old Combine” becomes known as the place one goes to; to get help, but nobody wants to be under Combine rule again.\n\nCivilization is re-establishing itself slowly, maybe very slowly, but at least it has a chance now. You spend the rest of your remaining years running your little section of civilization making things better when you can.\n\nOne day you’re stricken with sickness that progressively gets worse. All help is done for you, but you’re dying. You’re reminded of the Colonel except you don’t have to worry about getting shot like he did, as you’ve already picked out a suitable successor. Your first choice would’ve been Marina, as you know her to be capable, but as she’d said many times in the past she’s never had any desire herself for command. You never knew why, since she would’ve been perfect for it. After all right from the beginning she pushed you in the direction.\n\nYou hold her hand as you talk to her one last time on your death bed.\n\n“So, you really don’t mind Vivica taking charge of this place? You’re sure you don’t want it?” you ask while Marina shakes her head.\n“No. I never wanted it. I always wanted you to have the glory, and the recognition. You had so much potential…and you were never fully appreciated for the deeds you did.”\n“Hey, you know what they say, no good deed goes unpunished. Don’t worry about it, I never did.”\n“I always wished we could’ve had kids…I’m sorry I couldn’t give you any…to carry on your name…”\n“Marina, stop it. You know I never cared about that, besides I doubt if it was your problem anyway. I’m sure the time I spent in that fucking radiated city made me sterile. Hell, it’s probably what’s killing me now. Knew it was only a matter of time before that shit caught up with me. Marina, I don’t want to spend my last moments of you sad and wishing for things that didn’t happen. Let’s just spend it together in silence.”\n\nAfter telling each other you love one another, she holds on to your body until you draw your last breath.\n\nYou funeral is a quiet and respectful one. Your loss is felt, but as always life goes on. Marina tries to make sure people don’t forget what you did until the day she dies. Some heroes aren’t meant to be remembered though and with her death, eventually you’re virtually forgotten when Fort Justice is abandoned and a new one is rebuilt elsewhere. You become part of obscure history.\n\nHowever your now well worn tombstone (next to Marina’s) in the Old Fort Justice cemetery still displays words that would sum up what your attitude about your obscurity would be if you were still alive.\n\n“It was worth it.”\n",
  "page 274": "Going to another part of Zeropolis really isn’t going to help. The Shadow Horde will just eventually move on to those as well, you need to get out of this damn City. Even if you are hounded by humans at every turn, at least they’re easier to deal with than those overgrown beasts that are in the Shadow Horde’s ranks.\n\nStill you think you can make things slightly easier for yourself. You’re a mutant, but you aren’t exceptionally mutated to such a degree that you couldn’t pass yourself as one with a disguise. You immediately start searching through old Zeropolis Guard equipment, when you find a gas mask you think “Pefect.”\n\nYou also get some gloves and hooded cloaked, basically clothing that will completely hide your body and face. When you look in a broken mirror you are confident that not many would think you weren’t human unless they insisted you take off your mask.\n\nAfter gathering what other supplies you think you’ll need you leave Zeropolis. You’re not sure where you’re going to go though, you do know you’ll have to keep moving to avoid suspicion in human towns and given the Combine only just recently won its war against the Cybernetic Evolution, its troops might be on a heightened state of distrust.\n\nHowever the world is a big place and this is just a small section of it, who’s to say mutants are shot on sight everywhere? Hell maybe there’s even a place where there isn’t killing going on every five seconds. Probably not, but it’s worth a try to look for.\n\nWith this new goal in mind you begin your trek into the wasteland.\n",
  "page 255": "You know this area, and you don’t want to leave, so you attempt to keep a lower profile. It’s very difficult at first, and you struggle to keep your violent urges in check. You keep to eating rats and roaches. As a few month go by you begin to feel somewhat different. You don’t feel quite as “insane” anymore though your mind is still a little around the bend. You never really leave the warehouse anymore and begin sleeping in the GZS outpost again, spending hours talking and laughing to yourself in between snacks.\n\nEventually the uniformed mutants find your little hideaway. When you see them you’re surprised and annoyed, but you don’t feel the need to attack them. (Though you wouldn’t anyway since they’re heavily armed)\n\n“Hey! Get out of my house!”\n“See I knew this place had Ferals.” One of them says.\n“I dunno, he hasn’t attacked us yet, you sure he’s a Feral?”\n“Hm, you might be right, he sort of looks like one though, of course maybe he’s gotten better, y’know the Captain said it happens sometimes.”\n“Hey! I said get outta my house!” you exclaim again.\n\nThe uniformed mutants continue to ignore you.\n\n“What the hell do you think this place is?”\n“I dunno, but the Captain will be interested, with the fact there’s a generator and water recycler here…alright sorry to do this, but you gotta leave. This place is now the property of the Zeropolis Guard, which is us, and not you. So get your stuff and leave. You can go move into one of the many abandoned buildings in one of the neighborhoods.”\n\nYou attempt to protest, but the soldiers just roughly grab you and force you out of your home and throw you out on the street. They then warn you not to try that again or else they won’t be as nice next time. Having nowhere else to go, you follow their instructions and begin living in one of the abandoned buildings in one of the neighborhoods.\n\nMonths go by and you learn more about the things going on in the Dust District. (The area that you’ve been dwelling in) You don’t really understand all the intricate details, but from what you can tell, The Zeropolis Guard is attempting to make this area their base of sorts in their war against the Shadow Horde (The sewer mutants) part of this organizing involves killing out the remaining Ferals in the area and rebuilding it.\n\nAs you are basically under the protection of the Zeropolis Guard, you’re also subject to their whims and they expect you to pitch in and be a productive citizen like everyone else. In your case this means conscription.\n\nYou’re in the army now, but you’re still just trying to keep your mind from wandering. You never really did get over the “year of madness” that you suffered. Your mind is still disjointed, though when you kill Shadow Horde members, you do feel a sense of fulfillment, so it isn’t all bad. Many of your fellow soldiers kind of stay away from you though and you aren’t really considered for anything greater than just a regular soldier.\n\nEventually during one of the many battles with the Shadow Horde, you are struck down by a brutal blow to head with a very large piece of steel. You maintain consciousness for a few seconds before seeing a big boot come down on your face, making you just one of the many causalities in this mutant war.\n",
  "page 133": "You duck into the nearest building and hope you don’t bump into anything inside. From what’s left of it, it looks like a regular office building, similar to the one you used to work in. You find a relatively secluded office and lay low, hoping to hear the mob of freaks pass by the building. You really need to get out of this place. What the hell was Harry thinking sending you here, there’s nothing here except death…well actually you just answered your own question.\n\nAs the time passes, you think to yourself that the three stooges must’ve assumed you dead and left by now. They probably ran off when they heard your gunshots echo through the city. You were going to leave the Compound anyway, so you guess you’ve done that, now you just have to get out of this city alive and you’ll be safe…well safer anyway.\n\n\nYou explore a little bit of the building which has four floors, fortunately none of them inhabited. The fourth floor is exposed to the outside air and partially destroyed, so you don’t linger too long, you never know who or WHAT might be watching. You do notice that it’s getting to be night time though. You don’t hear anything anymore maybe you should leave now, you really don’t want to be here any longer than you have to be and its not just the crazed cannibals either, it’s the fact you’re standing in a radiated city with just a suit on that’s probably not protecting you from all the damage your chromosomes are experiencing every second you stick around.\n\nThen again running through the city at night is probably even more dangerous than running through it during the day.\n",
  "page 254": "NO! You must have something of substance! Something with more meat! You quickly leave the warehouse and go loping around the City like some sort of animal.\n\nYou stalk the streets in search of prey but find nothing! You begin snarling to yourself and getting madder, but suddenly you hear someone talking loudly nearby. You get quiet and slowly look around the corner and see three men in radiation suits carrying weapons.\n\n\n“Albert, for the last time will you fucking calm down, there ain’t gonna be nobody here! If you think this place is going to be crawling with mutant creatures, you’ve been watching too many movies!”\n“Well how do YOU know, Roger? I mean how do we know it won’t be?”\n“Look, Harry gave us this mission to do some scouting, not standing around with our thumbs up our asses arguing, now come on!”\n“Shh! Did you hear that?”\n“Christ, Steve not you too…”\n\nBefore Roger can complete his retort you come around the corner and fire your assault rifle at them haphazardly. You hit two of them before one of them runs off. One of them lies completely still as you approach, but the other is still twitching and convulsing as their body begins to shut down. You finish him off with a couple of blows to the head with your rifle butt before ripping the protective suit to get to the precious meat inside. However the noise of your weapon has caused other mutants to suddenly come out of the woodwork. They too want the flesh of these humans, but you won’t let them have it! This is YOUR kill!\n\nThe other mutants aren’t as well armed as you are, and when they try to take your kill you fire at them and begin trying to drag it back to your home. You only have so many bullets though and eventually it’s a feeding frenzy where you’re all fighting for the biggest piece. Eventually you grab a leg and an arm and run back to your lair to eat in solitude. When you’re finished you belch in satisfaction and fall asleep.\n\nIn the months to follow, you will continue to participate in these activities, though mutant flesh never seems to taste as good as that of human. You cease keeping up any sense of appearances or hygene, you don’t even sleep in the GZS research room anymore, preferring to sleep in the actually warehouse along with the rats and roaches. (Though you still go to drink from the water recycler down there) You’ve completely given in to the madness.\n\nA year passes…\n\nYou wake up again like you always do, slightly hungry. You grab a nearby roach and chomp on that until you can find something more substantial. It’s getting more difficult to hunt in this area though. For some reason most of the mutants here don’t seem to act like you do anymore. Many of them have gotten “better” and have even been engaging in somewhat normal activities. You know there are still hunting groups of others like you holdup in some nearby factories, but you were never a social animal, you’re a lone hunter. You don’t like to share. You also know not to stay out after night, as you’ve seen mutants much larger than yourself to stalk the streets, even you don’t want to mess with them if you don’t have to.\n\nSo far you’ve been successful despite the odds steadily becoming against you, however it would seem that event continue to conspire against you. A large group of mutants dressed in uniforms have been patrolling the area as of late in fact they’ve been purposely trying to make it safe by wiping out your types. You’ve come in conflict with a couple of them, but the firepower they pack is too much for you and you’ve long since run out of bullets. (At this point you’re just beating others over the head with the rifle or pistol whipping them)\n\nGranted life has never been safe or easy, but now it’s been getting particularly dangerous. Even in your simple delusional state, you’re wondering if you should find new hunting grounds.\n",
  "page 136": "You’ve already spent enough time in radsville to get sick, or mutate, what’s one more day? If something bad’s going to happen to you internally there’s really not much you can do about it now except hope the suit is more protective than you think it is. You can however probably lessen you chances of getting ripped apart and eaten if you don’t go wandering the city at night. You decide to search the building before it gets too dark; you don’t find anything really useful though, at least nothing that’s any more useful than what you’re already carrying. You end up looking in lunch area refrigerator and find some rotten food along side what would undoubtedly be flat pop at this stage. Nope you’re not going to find any supplies in this place, you’re just glad you had the sense to take extra water with you; you’ll probably need it assuming you manage to get out the city alive.\n\nEventually you go to an office that looks relatively secure and intact. You barricade the door and slump against one of the corners and fall asleep…lightly.\n\nThe next day arrives and you’re half surprised that you don’t find something gnawing on your arm (And relieved!) now that you’re fairly well rested again you take a quick check of your belongings, reload your rifle and prepare yourself.\n\nYou exit the building and start quickly tracing your way back to where you first arrived in the city. You don’t care where you end up, just as long as you’re out of this place. You’re about halfway to your destination when you come across a couple of bloody mangled bodies, radiation suited bodies. It’s hard to tell who’s who, since the heads have been taken and the entrails are lying all over the road, but it’s obviously two of three stooges. Something didn’t go well.\n\nYour brief inspection is interrupted by a shotgun blast that splatters the remains of one of the bodies all over your own suit.\n\n“HAAAAAAA MORE MEAT!” a raspy voice shouts, with a clicking reload of a shotgun. The thing that just tried to take your head off is shooting at you from an upper window of one of the buildings. You spin around and firing a burst causing it to duck for cover, but with his fellows being alerted, you really need to get the hell out of here.\n\nYou start running with the horde of freaks chasing you again. You can’t help feel like you’ve done this before! You see the end of the city though and can only hope they’ll stop chasing you when you finally leave it.\n\nOf course THAT doesn’t happen, even after you leave the city limits a lot are still in pursuit, In fact you even see a few lingering outside that join the chase, you turn around and unload a clip into the mob hoping it’ll slow it down a bit.\n\nWhile the mob tends to back off and disperse a bit, they still aren’t ready to give up completely, however you see more trouble, but possibly hope as well.\n\nThe car you arrived in is still there, there’s also another suited body lying close by it, you can only hope its Steve and that he still has the keys on him. Of course the cannibal freaks lingering around the body might be inclined to stop whatever plans of escape you might have.\n\nYou step up your speed, raise your empty rifle and smash it into the skull of the first ugly radiated cannibal that attacks you. To your surprise your force causes the damn thing’s face to completely cave in, killing it instantly. The other two grab on to your arms, causing you to back kick one in the stomach freeing up your other arm to punch the other one in the face. You grab Steve’s pistol still on the ground and quickly put a couple of slugs in the pair of them before they can recover. You then thank gods of luck that your next find is his keys still in his hand, as the rest of the mob has regrouped and quickly approaching.\n\nFiring another few rounds into the mob, you quickly get in the car and start it up, which it does immediately. You spin the car around and drive off, the group chases you for a little while still, but eventually you leave them far behind. You’ve escaped.\n\n“Fuck yeah! That was just like a fuckin’ zombie movie!” you say to yourself half laughing in victory.\n\nIn fact it’s a victory that’s better than you could’ve thought, you now have a car to drive around in, well until it runs out of gas, but you’re hoping you’ll find someplace that’s still somewhat civilized by the time that happens (Or at least some more gas). While you’re driving you wonder if you shouldn’t just go back to the Compound, but you shake your head at this idea. There has to be better places than that to stay, and even if there aren’t you’ve proven to yourself that you’re able to survive on your own under strenuous conditions. You like being by yourself anyway, though it’s too bad you won’t get to see Marina again, but as they say you can’t have everything.\n\nYou don’t know what the possible future holds, but you’re confident that you’ll be able to handle it.\n",
  "page 135": "The longer you stay, the more likely you’re going to get attacked again, and you certainly don’t want to fall asleep here. You take a quick look outside one of the completely destroyed windows and see if the nearby street is empty and make haste. Of course its night and with no working lighting you can’t see too well, so you’re relying mainly on the moon to light your way. You try to retrace your steps back from where you came from, but all these damn streets look the same in the dark even with the dim moonlight, you end up taking the incorrect one and it isn’t until you run into a blind alley that you realize you’ve made the wrong turn in more ways than one.\n\n“Do you want to see my dolly? It’s soft and pink…just like yoooooooooou.” Some sort of mutant freak lying against the wall says to you holding some sort of plush toy.\n“Holy fuck!” you shout as you’re caught off guard, and waste not time in shooting the damn thing. Unfortunately you bring about unwanted attention, and more figures start to appear nearby, you can’t get a good look at them, but their glowing eyes don’t look friendly.\n\nYou start running and firing again, but to your great surprise, some of them fire back! They’re also better shots, having night vision and all.\n\nYour last moments are somewhat merciful though since you die of the gunshot wounds first as you hear the insane victory sounds the mutants are making as they approach your bloody body.\n",
  "page 256": "Sensing when would be the best time to leave; you abandon your home and move on to another part of the City that’s less organized. You end up in the Downtown area, oddly enough you end up taking residence in the same building you once worked at.\n\nYou haven’t gotten a “feel” for this area yet and initially are at a disadvantage when hunting. Many times your “dinner” comes from those who were attempting to hunt you, but failed to recognize your strength and quickness. Soon though, you do alright.\n\nYour life is pretty simple from here on out, you hunt for others and you try to survive, you last longer than most, but eventually the move towards order marches forward and comes to the Downtown area.\n\nThe uniformed mutants eventually attempt to organize this area as well in their efforts to gain territory from another group of united mutants namely the ones that live in the sewers. Once again your type are hunted down and wiped out.\n\nThis time you are caught in the open by several of them and are shot like a dog in the street.\n",
  "page 259": "You don’t really have anything better to do, and you are sort of interested in learning more about your surroundings. You are living here now after all.\n\n“Uh sure I’ll go with you. What do I do exactly?”\n“You’ll go? Great! You don’t really have to do too much really, I just need someone to help with the whole protection thing while I search, since Ted here is being a jackass and not giving me any bullets!”\n“Hey those are in damn scarce supply in the first place! In fact, you better start finding them on your own soon, because I don’t have too many to spare anymore anyway. I need something to defend my shop with. Here!” Ted pulls out three bullets from his ragged pockets and gives them to Carl. “That’s coming out anything you bring back too, and if you guys are going downtown, you better do it now, before nightfall. See you later.”\n\nYou and Carl set off, while you’re walking you notice other mutants wandering in the neighborhood, but they don’t attack, in fact many of them are just watching the both of you or going about their business. (Like catching a rat to eat)\n\n“So is this area safe or something? Nobody’s attacking us.” You ask.\n“Of course it’s safe, well safe as anything can be in this place. I mean there’s still always the Ferals that roam around, but not so much around here anymore. The people around here in the Dust District don’t even try to eat one another. Probably due to the fact that a lot of people used to live here and work together in the factory and warehouses nearby, so I guess there’s that sense of unity as it were. Though I’m sure most of them did attack each other at one time. Still, this is a severely new situation, you can’t blame TOO much on what happened during people’s madness. Weird what happened though, I mean do you think the enemy dropped some sort of nuclear nerve agent combo on this place? Or did we all just go temporarily insane in the face of the shear devastation?”\n“I really couldn’t tell you, Carl. Maybe the second one I guess.” You say keeping your secret information on the reasons to yourself.\n“Yeah, doesn’t take much for us to fall apart I suppose. The Zeropolis Guard have also claimed they’re going to make this place even safer when they set up a new base here, though I sort of wish they’d just leave us alone. I get the impression they’ll be trying to tell us all what to do and conscripting us to fight the Shadow Horde.”\n“What is the Shadow Horde anyway?”\n“Man, you don’t know who THEY are? Then again you didn’t know the city name either! Anyway The Shadow Horde is a group of mutants who primarily live in the sewers, though they do come out at night and attack anyone who isn’t part their group. They’re sort of like the Ferals, except they are a lot more organized and even more vicious. I’ve heard they have a leader of some sort; I’ve only heard rumors though; ranging from a giant abomination, to a beautiful priestess of some sort. Have a hard time believing a lot of them, the only thing I do know is you don’t want to get outside at night, let alone even enter the sewers!”\n\nCarl continues to about various things of Zeropolis on your way Downtown. As fucked up as things are, you can’t help but be fascinated by it all. You feel like you’re actually living in some sort of 80s low budget post apocalyptic movie. You ask him if anyone actually leaves Zeropolis, but he says it’s rare. The Ferals and other more territorial mutants seem content on staying in the City, and as for the other “normal” ones, it’s happened, but it seems mutation isn’t a common theme outside Zeropolis. Most mutants are shot on sight or at least chased off. At least those are the stories he’s heard from a couple of people he knows that have left only to come back.\n\nThe closer you get to Downtown the more Carl stops talking only telling you to keep a look out and to be quiet. Lots of Ferals fight each other in the Downtown area and will obviously attack anyone else. Plus there are other scavengers here that will try to bushwhack each other as well. Carl pulls out a large bag and you and he start going into various devastated buildings where he grabs things of varying interest.\n\nA few instance you see large groups of Ferals in the street, but Carl tells you not to fire, since they’re all fighting each other at the time. Another instance when you’re on the second floor of an apartment store, another mutant clobbers Carl with a lead pipe and tries to make off with the bag of goodies, but a couple of shots put the thief down.\n\n“Thanks. Oh fuck, I think the shots caught the attention of the Ferals outside, we better get out of here!”\n\nYou and Carl rush out the building and after you fire a few more shots at the Ferals you both make a beeline back the Dust District, unfortunately you and Carl have to retreat and backtrack several times to avoid large groups of Ferals, until finally when you get out of the area, its twilight and you still haven’t gotten back to the Dust District yet.\n\nYou and Carl hear a nearby sewer manhole opening up…\n\n\n“Oh shit we’re gonna die!” Carl yells and starts running. He’s in such a hurry to getaway he trips and dumps his bag with all the contents inside! He frantically starts putting everything back in, but already you can see the Shadow Horde starting to come out, and yeah they do look a hell of a lot meaner than the typical Ferals, which is pretty hard to do. The fact that they start shouting\n\n“CARL GET YOUR ASS UP, WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!” you yell and start blasting Horde members with your assault rifle, picking your shots, but when they fire back, you can’t stand your ground for long and run leaving Carl behind.\n\nYou hear Carl trying to catch up with you, but you soon hear more shots, yell of pain followed by the collapsing of a body. You turn around to see one of the Horde trying to finish Carl off with a spiked bat, but he blasts the mutant in the head with his pistol twice killing it. He’s wounded and even if you went back to get him, the rest of the Horde is closing in and you’d never outrun them if you carried Carl on your back.\n\nSensing the end is near; Carl uses his last bullet to save himself a torturous death by the hands of the Horde. Of course now you have worry about yourself.\n",
  "page 139": "Nope, in for a penny in for a pound. If nothing else, Marina’s still there and the fact her actions basically saved your life is enough to make you stay.\n\nThe rest of the trip is Steve still ranting to himself about the deaths of his friends. True, they weren’t your friends, but you guess you can see why he might be upset. You’d radio in to the Compound, but Roger was the one carrying it and he’s a headless (and probably now eaten) corpse back in the city.\n\nYou don’t say anything else until Steve nearly drives the car into the gate of the Compound at which point you step out of the car and remove the hot ass radiation suit and demand to see Harry. Everyone is wondering what’s going on.\n\nHarry hears your shouting and comes out of barracks, the Colonel does as well; good you want him to be here as well.\n\n“What is your major malfunction you screaming queen?” Harry asks angrily, as if you’re the one at fault.\n“My malfunction is sending us to the goddamn city was a fucking stupid ass idea! What made you think there would anything of any use there anyway? You just trying to get us all killed?”\n“No, just you, cupcake.”\n“You call me fuckin’ cupcake one more time and me and you are gonna go round and round you dumb fucking gung ho military wanna be asshole!”\n\nBefore Harry can respond to your insult the Colonel steps in.\n\n“ALRIGHT ENOUGH! I won’t have infighting in my Compound! Harry we talked about this before that I didn’t want any recon missions to the city! At least not until we got better established!”\n”But Colonel, I though we should…”\n“You DON’T THINK! That’s for ME to do! You obey fucking orders! I’M in fucking charge around here and you better not forget that!”\n“Yes Colonel.” Harry utters grudgingly.\n\nNow the Colonel turns his attention to you.\n\n“And YOU do not fucking rant like a goddamn maniac in front of everyone lowering morale and encouraging dissention! Like it or not, you’re going to be sent on dangerous missions. If you want to stay here you better start learning to get with the fucking program and follow orders!”\n\nYou’re getting really tired of hearing that one.\n\n“So, all this aside, what exactly happened in the city and what did you find?”\n“Nothing! There’s just a bunch of crazed cannibal freaks living there, armed and dangerous.”\n“I see, well then all future missions to the city are going to be called off. I’m not risking anymore of my people’s lives by sending them there. We’ve lost too many people on these recon missions quite frankly. I sent a couple of people on a special assignment and I haven’t heard any word back from them, not to mention the people we’ve lost trying to contact other known towns. Fortunately, it hasn’t been a complete loss we how found a few pockets of civilization. We need to start developing good relations with them now though. This will help in our rebuilding process. For now you’re dismissed, but don’t get too comfortable. I’ll be sending you out again soon.”\n\nYou turn away and go back to your room in the underground part of the Compound wondering if you shouldn’t just fucking leave, just then you get a visit from Marina. You’re kind of glad to see her despite your pissed off mood.\n\n“Are you okay?”\n“Hell if I know I just spent a day in radiationville. I’ll find out when my balls start shriveling up in three days!”\n“I think those suits would protect you from that happening.”\n“Yeah, I know everyone thinks they’re magical…nevermind I’m not even mad about that, I mean I understand we all got this lofty mission of re-establishing civilization or some shit, but I just don’t see the fucking point in it. And I REALLY don’t see the point in getting sent on suicide missions!”\n\nMarina sits next to you and tries to explain.\n\n“Okay, that WAS a mistake. In fact I wish you would’ve told me! I could’ve told the Colonel and he would’ve cancelled the mission! Harry likes to think he’s second in command, but he’s really just louder and more aggressive than most around here and that’s why he’s in a command position, but I think you could do just as good a job. I mean you’ve already braved and lived through going to the city and from what you described and Steve’s mental breakdown it sounds like it was pretty bad. Total anarchy and lawlessness. And that’s one of the reasons why rebuilding civilization is important. Do you really want to live in a world like that? I know you think this is all some sort of paramilitary bullshit, but we DO have a plan. Isn’t it more advantageous to try to make the world a better place and have some sort of order?”\n“Trying to make the world a better place…yeah a lot of people in the past have thought they were doing that too and you can see how that turned out…THIS! Look, it’s a nice idea, but I don’t see it happening, not then, not now, not ever. I’d say our best bet would be to just try to live out the rest of lives as comfortably as we can in this hellhole of a world and not go messing around with shit unless its necessary.”\n“…so I take it you’re going to leave?”\n\nYou look a Marina before responding.\n\n“No, I’m not leaving, but I’m staying for you, not an ideology or plan. My feelings for you override whatever disagreements I have with the current political agenda, if that’s even the proper term for it.”\n“Well that’s sweet, but I do hope you develop a more positive attitude about this place.” Marina says hugging you.\n“Doubt it, but I suppose anything’s possible now.”\n\nA year passes…\n\nYou don’t feel any different, but you’re used to the Compound’s plan of “re-building” civilization. You’ve moved up the ranks due to the fact that you’re competent, something the Colonel realizes and respects even if Harry hates you. But due to your “loner” attitude you’re usually sent on scouting missions by yourself rather than given any kind of command position. Ironically, you’ve been one of the key people in developing good relations with the nearby towns, since you’ve developed the knack of the sniper’s art over the past year which really comes in handy when killing raiders. The Colonel’s of the idea that if the Compound can prove its able to help defend towns from raiders, more people will want to join, the towns will be more willing to trade or even better a whole town will want a formal alliance.\n\nPerhaps slightly imperialistic, but what the hell, it’s better to be the top dog and at least the intention is somewhat for good reasons. All part of the rebuilding process.\n\n\nRight now you’re in the town that you found called Lost Springs, it’s a remote little town that doesn’t have any problems with raiders due to its somewhat hidden location (Though the wandering mutant bear is a problem sometimes) and while they’re friendly with you, it’s clear they just want to be left alone and keep to themselves. This might not be a problem, except they have a continual supply of fresh water from some underground stream. Not even mildly radioactive! (Though you’re still convinced you’re going to start mutating any day now since your trip to the city) It’s a resource that can’t just simply be ignored, but you’re not exactly a diplomat, so you’re not going to be convincing them on your own (And it’s not like you can impress them with your super duper raider killing skills)\n",

  "page 260": "“Nah, that’s alright. I guess I’ll be heading out.” You reply and leave the shop with the full intent on going home.\n\nOn your way back home you unfortunately run into a couple of the Zeropolis Guardsmen who seem intent on giving you a hard time.\n\n“Whoa there, who the fuck are you, and where do you think you’re going with that rifle on your back?” one asks.\n“What the hell difference does it make to you?”\n“It makes a difference because we patrol this area all the damn time and we’ve never seen you before. Not to mention you look fucking suspicious with an assault rifle on your person!”\n“…What the fuck? What about you guys?! You got damn machine guns and grenades!”\n“Yeah, well WE’RE members of The Zeropolis Guard! We need this shit in our war with the Shadow Horde, while you’re just a lowly civvy! We’re going to be occupying this area soon and you won’t need something like that as protection anymore. In fact a fine weapon like that would be better put to use by The Zeropolis Guard, so you probably should hand it over right now.”\n“Ha ha, you’re a funny guy. I don’t think so.” You say.\n“That wasn’t a request, that was a goddamn order!”\n“Sorry, but as you just pointed out I’m just a lowly civvy, so I’m not inclined to follow your stupid ass orders.”\n\nThis last remark does it. The two soldiers now have their excuse, they raise their weapons and you do like wise. A small shoot out occurs in which you end up killing one of them and wounding the other, however they manage to wound you severely as well. As you attempt to take cover behind a wrecked car, the surviving Guardsmen throws a grenade in your direction which you are unable to react to in time before it blows you up.\n",
  "page 262": "No time for fancy shit, you just have to RUN! You run and don’t look back, though you can still hear them chasing you, and other Horde members start popping out of other sewer gratings.\n\nEventually you get to the Dust District, but they’re still chasing you, that’s when you hear shouting coming from in front and above you as well.\n\n“ALRIGHT START THROWING AND FIRING!”\n\nSuddenly from up high bottles crash to the ground releasing gouts of fire. Molotovs. Next comes the sounds and flash of machine gun fire from everywhere.\n\n“OH SHIT!” you shout and duck down and roll into a nearby building. The Horde was still chasing you, but most of them got burned by the Molotovs, the shrieking is unnatural sounding, but it’s soon put to an end when the flaming flailing bodies are shot by the machine guns. After it’s all over you pick yourself up only to get kicked in the ribs and a rifle shoved in your face.\n\n\n“Don’t fuckin’ move Shadow scum!” a uniformed mutant orders.\n“I’m not…”\n“Silence!” another kick, this time to the nuts. While you hold your crotch in pain, another uniformed mutant arrives, but this one has a higher rank.\n\n“Alright Private, that’ll do for now, let’s see what this fucker has to say about his buddies…what the fuck? This ain’t no Shadow! He’s too fuckin’ pretty for one thing, and not nearly muscular enough.”\n“(Groan) I’m not, I live in this area! I was scavenging Downtown with another and we got caught after dark…he’s dead.” You say picking yourself up.\n“Yeah, that’s usually what happens. Woulda happened to you too had we not set up base here in the Dust District. This place will be completely safe from now on as it is officially under direct protection by the Zeropolis Guard. I’m Captain Salazar.”\n\nWell that explains the uniforms.\n\n“…yeah I heard of you guys. I also heard you only had scouts in the area though.”\n“Well we move fast, and we needed a new base camp. Our last position was steadily being overrun by Ferals during the day and the Shadow Horde at night. But I think here is a good position to make a stand. This area doesn’t have as many sewer entrances, Feral activity is low, and best of all there’s the abandoned factory and plant nearby. Maybe one day we can power up the entire City again, but for right now we’re trying to just get power to this district, though even that will take awhile. The Zeropolis Guard is dedicated to bringing order to this city and I think this is the best place to start.”\n“Hey that’s great, okay I’ve had a hard day; I think I’ll just go home now…”\n\nCaptain Salazar suddenly stops you.\n\n“While you’re free to go back home citizen, I can’t help but notice your weapons…now while I certainly understand the need for personal protection, especially given this unstable situation and your current choice of profession, so you may keep your pistol. However, your assault rifle would be of great use to us. We need all the maximum firepower we can get to better defend this area.”\n“Well it doesn’t have many bullets left though.” You say, but Salazar merely smiles at your attempt to keep your rifle. The private who kicked you looks at you like he’s anxious for you to try something.\n“That’s alright; we have plenty of ammo suitable for it. However, if you wish to actively join the Zeropolis Guard, then you certainly would have need for such a weapon… do you wish to join?”\n“Uh no. That’s okay.” You say helplessly handing over you weapon. Salazar takes it.\n“Pity, you seem like you’d make an excellent solider. Still, our offer is always open and I’m sure you’ll be able to easily find us. You may return to your home.”\n\nYou make you way back home, in fact you’ll be really glad to get home, today wasn’t very fun, reminds you of why you always preferred your own company. You sort of wonder though about how things might change with the Guard messing around in the area. While this warehouse is sort of in an isolated part of the Dust District, you can only imagine that it’s a matter of time before the Guard start snooping around here and given you have a generator and water recycler, they’ll probably want this place for themselves and you’d have to go live in one of the crappy neighborhoods like everyone else.\n\nOf course you might be able to swing things to your benefit if you did join the Zeropolis Guard, though that might mean they’ll be sending you on missions where you can get yourself killed.\n\nBefore you fall asleep, you think about the future and how you’re going to deal with this situation.\n",
  "page 140": "Fuck this shit, you’re not dealing with it anymore. You point your rifle at Steve, who’s still hysterical about his friends dying.\n\n“Alright Steve, pull this car over and get out.” You say calmly.\n“Wha…WHAT? Are you fuckin’ crazy man? What’re you doing?”\n“I’m giving you a chance to fucking live that’s what! Now pull this fuckin’ car over!”\n“My friends just fuckin’ died and you pull this shit?”\n“You wanna end up like your goddamn idiot friends? You pull this car over now or your brains are gonna be all over the fuckin’ windshield! DO IT!”\n“NO!” Steve shouts and violently swerves the car into nearby wreck alongside the road which you didn’t even notice until you went flying out of the windshield upon impact.\n\nYou walk away from the crash, but you don’t walk far when you fall unconscious from your head wound injury and never wake up.\n",
  "page 143": "You’re in this for rebuilding civilization, so you figure you should do all you can. You leave the town to get in a better transmitting area and radio in and explain the situation. Steve’s working the radio (Never could go out again after the incident in the city)\n\n“…yeah, so if you can send some more diplomatic people here, that might help.” You finish saying.\n“So, you’re saying there’s a fresh supply of water and no standing defense force there?” Steve asks.\n“No, not really. They don’t have any problems with raiders, just with some of the more aggressive wildlife. Defenses basically consist of a few good hunters with rifles, but like I said they aren’t interested in us being able to defend them. A different bargaining chip is going to be necessary.”\n\nSuddenly you’re cut off for a little while, you think your radio is having problems, but soon you start getting a response again.\n\n“Okay, report back to the Compound. We’ll send Vivica and a few others to take care of it. We got the location of the place from your information.” Steve says and signs off.\n\nYou head back to the Compound. You know Vivica’s one of the more diplomatic types, so you don’t think anything else of it. She’ll ether be successful or she won’t.\n\nWhen you get back though you find out one of the “others” that went with her was Harry. You find that suspicious, he’s NEVER gone on a single recon mission, let alone anything diplomatic.\n\nSoon the group sent to Lost Springs returns and you see Harry and a couple of the more obedient people to him, who you don’t see is Vivica. You can’t help but think the worst.\n\nAnd you turn out to be right unfortunately.\n\n\nHarry tells a story to everyone of how the people became hostile and they had to defend themselves, Vivica was “unfortunately” killed in the process. He goes on to say that he’s secured the town, by leaving some people in place. You’re over hearing this in the courtyard of the Compound and you can’t stay silent.\n\n“You fucking murdering liar. Those people were fucking peaceful! I was there and never once were they hostile! You took that town by force and probably had Vivica killed when she tried to stop you and your fucking mindless lackies!”\n“Watch your fucking mouth cupcake! Don’t condemn my actions for your own failures because you’re too much of a pussy to do what needs to be done! I’m telling you they attacked us! I got witnesses! What the fuck do you have? Shit, how do we even know you weren’t fucking collaborating with them and trying to lead us into a trap? It’s a well known fact you’re not exactly loyal to the Compound.”\n“LOYAL? What the fuck? You fucking dipshit I’M one of fuckin’ people who’s been key in the HELPING the fuckin’ Compound! Or have you forgotten all the good relations we have with other towns due to me?”\n“Yeah and how do we know you’re not getting all chummy with all these outsiders in the attempt to try to build up your own fucking army to take power? In fact I’m thinking I might be going on a lot more of these missions, I don’t trust you and neither should the rest of you!”\n\nAt this point Marina steps in to say something, but you stop her causing Harry to taunt you again.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right Cupcake, hide behind Marina’s skirt again.”\n“Harry, I dunno if you’re more jealous of the fact that I’m actually more useful to the Compound, or the fact that I have access TO Marina’s skirt, something I heard you attempted before I got here and failed miserably.”\n\nYou struck a nerve there. Harry lunges at you and the both of you tussle on the ground for awhile before the Colonel finally arrives wondering what the fuck has been going on. After reprimanding the pair of you, he calls you in his office for a full report of what exactly happened when you were at Lost Springs, then he does the same with Harry, unfortunately Harry has a few people that are loyal to him that are willing to back up his bullshit. Assuming they would even be believed, the citizens of Lost Springs can’t even back you up, since as it turns out later Harry killed them all.\n\nAnd while the Colonel isn’t taken with the idea that you have some sort of ulterior motive, he does allow Harry to start heading out on missions, since he did acquire a useful resource for the Compound.\n\nFour more years pass…\n\nFive years total have passed and The Compound has grown somewhat, not much though. The theory to that of course is the background radiation has probably made a lot of folks sterile. (And you’re damn sure you probably are, after that trip to the city that you still continue to think about) however it has become much more than “The Compound” now. Alliances have been forged with other towns. The Compound has been renamed Fort Justice and the alliance itself is known as The Combine.\n\nOf course the term “alliance probably isn’t really appropriate here. After the Lost Springs incident, things started getting a lot more authoritarian. Over time the towns you’d established peaceful relations with, Harry started hinting that a more permanent military force be established in them. (To help with raider problems more readily as he tried to claim)\n\nNew towns that were come across were usually bullied into “joining” or outright taken by force and lowest of all, there’s been actual recruitment OF raiders, some of them being stationed in the very town they were attacking on a regular basis.\n\nYou can’t believe the Colonel doesn’t stop Harry’s actions, but the problem is, is it IS working. The Combine is thriving under this aggressive strategy and becoming a strong entity. You on the other hand are eventually relegated to guard duty at Fort Jusitce, Marina finds the whole thing unfair and becomes really disillusioned with the new direction that this place has taken.\n\nIn fact she does something you never thought she would, she suggests you leave and you can’t say you’re not in agreement with the idea. Not just because you never really cared about the “rebuilding civilization” process anyway, but more because Harry’s power is starting to increase day by day lately and the Colonel has been sick, in fact he’s probably going to die any day now. It’s only a matter of time before Harry is in total control and when that day comes, you’ll be fucked if you’re still here.\n\nYou and Marina pack what supplies you can and start loading them into one of the vehicles. This doesn’t go unnoticed, in fact you start being questioned since there was no order to take one of the vehicles out and you’re no longer on scout duty anymore. You try to come up with a lie on the spot, but words fail you at the moment and you resort to more direct measures and slug the nosey bastard in the face, dropping him.\n\n“Get in the fuckin’ car now Marina!” you shout as you do likewise.\n",
  "page 142": "If they don’t want your help; they don’t want your help. You can understand that. No point in bringing in anyone else to debate the issue. You get on your motorcycle and depart. When you get back to the Compound you just say you didn’t find anything on this little excursion. Life continues.\n\nFour years pass…\n\n\nFive years total have passed and The Compound has grown somewhat, not much though. The theory to that of course is the background radiation has probably made a lot of folks sterile. (And you’re damn sure you probably are, after that trip to the city that you still continue to think about) however it has become much more than “The Compound” now. Alliances have been forged with other towns thanks to you and others. The Compound has been renamed Fort Justice and the alliance itself is known as The Combine.\n\nHowever, not everything is stable. The Colonel hasn’t been well lately; in fact he’s been sick for the past year. Everyone’s wondering if he’s going to die. You’ve noticed Harry has been taking a lot of liberties with orders lately, which you’re constantly always arguing with him about. If it was up to him, he’d put all the towns you’re allied with under martial law. You can’t even believe he suggested sending people to the city again, since he thinks that all the survivors were probably dead by now and it would be “safe”.\n\nOne day the Colonel wants to see you in private as he lies on what is probably going to be his death bed soon. He addresses you immediately when you enter.\n\n“Good you’re here, I don’t have long and I need to talk to you.”\n“Uh, okay.”\n“Go look at those schematics on the table over there.”\n\nYou do as the Colonel says, and see some blue prints of what looks to be a base of some sort. You also see the logo “GZS” in several places. You remember that was the logo of that corporation that was trying to sell everyone their Shelters before the bombs hit. You sometimes wonder how things would’ve turned out, if you bought one. While you’re looking, the Colonel continues to speak.\n\nThat’s the floor plans to a top secret military base, my friend Alex got them for me a long time ago before the bombs dropped. He used to work there. It was some place where the government and the Ground Zero Survival Corporation were doing a secret joint project. Something to do with weapons. I always thought it would be a great benefit, if we could ever get a hold of whatever they were working on. I tried to make contact with the base since I know the radio frequency it used, but I never got any response from Alex or anyone.”\n“Hmm, so why didn’t you ever send some people there?”\n“Wow, you really are in your own little world, I figured you at least heard other people talk about it in the past. Anyway I did. Several times about five years ago. Everyone I ever sent never returned. Got to the point where I couldn’t in good conscience sent people to what looked to be their deaths, besides a lot of people were less than enthusiastic to accept the mission, the last few times I sent people out they just deserted. Eventually I just wrote it off that maybe the place is occupied by a superior hostile force. Just one of the reasons why I was really keen on the idea of creating an alliance with surrounding towns. Who knows when that force would decide to venture out and start heading this way? Actually a couple of years ago, I thought about sending YOU out there. I figured you being the most capable; you might actually survive and get back to be able to report something.”\n“What stopped you?”\n“I couldn’t risk lose one of my best people, especially since you were doing a good job at proving we could help protect the other towns. Besides you already got sent to one unnecessary death trap five years ago, didn’t seem right to send you to another.”\n\nYou’re wondering where the Colonel going with all this, so you get to the point.\n\n“So what’s all this ultimately have to do with me?”\n“I’m promoting you right now since I want you to take over after I die.”\n“What?!”\n“This place needs someone stable, Harry isn’t suitable. In fact, I dare say he won’t be pleased with this decision…you may even have to kill him.”\n\nYou’re a little overwhelmed by all this.\n\n“Whoa, whoa, hold the fucking phone! I don’t want this!”\n“I know you don’t, but it’s the best chance for the Combine’s survival, because that hostile force I mentioned? It’s real. And it’s on its way. Recently I’ve been picking up radio signals and they are from the base. They didn’t say much, except that they were coming to cleanse this place. I haven’t told ANYONE about this yet.”\n“What, is it some sort of heavily armed professional military group or some shit?”\n“I wish. I question if they’re even human. The voice sounded cold and robotic. I think we’re going to find out first hand what exactly the government and GZS were secretly working on.”\n“Well hold on, couldn’t they be masking their voice?”\n“I suppose it’s possible, but I dunno…something in my heart tells me that this is going to be really bad…like it won’t just stop here. I’m almost glad I won’t be around to see the destruction.”\n“I still don’t understand why you want me to take over; I’m not exactly the leader of men. In fact I’d say they’d listen to Harry before they listen to me.”\n“I can’t argue with you anymore…maybe you’re right…maybe not…the choice I suppose will be up to you…all I’ll say is with Harry in charge you might as well leave the Combine now, because I don’t wager you’ll be alive under his reign long enough to even see the attack occur. Maybe it might even be for the best, I wonder if even the total strength of the Combine will be enough to drive this attack back.”\n\nThe Colonel sounds like he’s being a bit over dramatic, he’s making a lot of assumptions here. You not sure you want all this responsibility, but if you’re going to take it, you better do it now.\n",
  "page 263": "You begin taking side streets and back alleys in a vain attempt to lose your pursuers, the only problem with this is tactic is, it isn’t like there’s only one sewer grating. They’re all over Zeropolis meaning the Shadow Horde can pop up out of anywhere so “losing” them isn’t really possible.\n\nYou’re running down an alley when all of a sudden a very LARGE being comes leaping out of nowhere in front of you. Its ugly, its muscles are unnaturally large and it’s fully intent on killing you.\n\nYou let fly your remaining rounds from your assault rifle, but it doesn’t even stop the big mutant. You attempt to pull your pistol, but with one shot from its own, it blows a big hole in your body, and then it finishes you off by stabbing you repeatedly in the head with its knife.\n",
  "page 167": "You unload a clip into the cyborg, not knowing if your bullets are going to hurt it or not. You manage to do something since you knock it to the ground and you see it spark, before you head for the elevator.\n\n“Hostile detected! Enacting defense systems!” a robotic voice echoes. You begin to panic when the elevator refuses to open and more cybernetic beings come at you. You can’t stop them, and you expect a quick death by their weapons, but unfortunately that doesn’t occur.\n\nInstead they knock you out and take you to Alex. When you come to you’re lying naked, tied to an operating table with a bunch of tubes in you. Alex is hovering over you with a scalpel. He’s obviously deranged.\n\n\n“Well I see I didn’t use enough anesthesia, I’ll have to apply more…I also see by this letter and his ring the Colonel sent you. Probably all a ruse of friendship to kill me no doubt. I never did trust him. Well his loss will be my gain. I’m going to remake you. Better, stronger, faster. Just like the Million Dollar Man, except this won’t cost any money, just my time. I’ve been studying about some new cybernetic implants I want to test. I think I know enough about the procedure for it to be successful. You’ll thank me for this, trust me. L17 hand me the bone saw.”\n\nYou pass out again, which is just as well since Alex butchers your body trying to “remake” you. His crude skills fail in the attempt and you die on the surgical table, with Alex cursing about accidentally severing multiple arteries of yours.\n",
  "page 287": "“We need to get our shit together first, look, we got people all over the damn place and wounded everywhere.” You say surveying the damage.\n“You can’t be serious! We need to attack NOW! Or don’t you remember what they nearly did to our son?” Lisa exclaims.\n“Christ Lisa, I’m aware of ALL the shit they’ve done! What I’m saying is we need to organize here, and not just throw people at them until something happens! I understand that’s the Shadow Horde way of doing things but…”\n\nAt this point Lisa slaps you, and while your skin is tough, it still manages to sting.\n\n“Oh fuck you; if it hadn’t been for YOUR duplicity we wouldn’t even BE in this situation!”\n“Look Lisa, we NEED to at least regroup. I’m sure that hospital is going to be their last stand and we can’t go in attacking half assed. We need to attack from all sides and cut off all avenues of escape so we don’t have to deal with guerilla hold outs after the main attack is over. We want to kill them ALL in one fell swoop; we don’t want the fucking Savior to escape to cause trouble later!”\n\nAfter a little more debate, Lisa finally agrees and you quickly gather your troops and implement a plan while Lisa takes care of her own end of things. Within a couple days you’re ready, but Lisa still being strong willed sort she is, jumps the gun and begins before you.\n\n“Goddamn it Lisa…”\n\nThe battle to the hospital is a slaughter on the Glow Children’s side. They still haven’t recovered from the battle of Downtown and they’ve been losing many to the Shadow Horde. The Zeropolis Legion doesn’t lose too many troops, though the Shadow Horde is taking a beating due to the fact that they’re taking the brunt of the Glow Children’s hospital defenses. That needn’t had been the case had Lisa not attacked so soon. By the time you make it to the hospital most of the heavy fighting has been done. Dead bodies of both Glow Children and the Shadow Horde are littering the streets. Lisa stands outside the hospital seemingly unconcerned.\n\n“What the fuck Lisa? I told you to fuckin’ wait! You look like you lost your whole goddamn Horde trying to storm this hospital!”\n“Who cares? If they aren’t strong enough to survive then they can die like the rest. They’re meant to serve me anyway, and the Glow Children MUST pay for what they nearly did to my son, no matter what the costs. Now go in and PROVE you’re a father by doing what needs to be done. Should be easy…I did most of the work for you.”\n\nYou shake your head trying to reason with Lisa’s recent volatile emotions, and head into the hospital with your own people. Sounds of battle are heard and body parts are all over the place. After a few shoot outs with the few wretched hold outs, you eventually track down the infamous Savior. Yet another old face that looks a lot different from when you last saw it.\n\nA severely burned female cyborg attempting to fix up one of her Glow Children on an operating table throws her scalpel down in frustration when she realizes nothing more can be done and sees you enter the room.\n\n“Mutants! Fucking goddamn back stabbing mutants…you’re no good for anything!” she shouts.\n“Wow, AVA that’s a lot of emotion for a cyborg.” You say calmly.\n“Let’s see how emotionless you remain when you see YOUR future destroyed before your eyes. This is all your fault! YOU caused all this! You did this to me!”\n“Yeah, yeah, I’ve been getting that line from everyone lately. It’s getting old.”\n“Fool. We would’ve brought unity to the world; mutants would’ve been incorporated too. All you had to do was help, but instead you betrayed us to those who hate you!”\n“Yeah and that incorporation would’ve been the total loss of free will I’m sure. No thanks, I’d rather take my chances with some disjointed puny humans than an army of unified cyborgs.”\n“Ah, of course. You mutants think YOU are fit to rule the world. Huh. You’re little better than humans. You still act on emotion rather than clarity. Look at your wife…she sacrificed hundreds of her own people who she claimed she looked after all for a mere child. Don’t look so surprised that I know about that act of total illogic, I could hear her screaming her rants of vengeance when I first saw her approach the hospital with her mutant rabble.”\n“First of all she’s not my wife. And what about what you did? Are you saying sending in multitudes of brainwashed mutants was so different?”\n”YES! Yes it was! My purpose was NOT based on emotion! I was trying to kill as many as mutants as possible! I had a clear goal! A clarity of purpose! What do I care what mutants died on who’s side? I am not one of them!”\n“Uh…yeah. Well sounds pretty emotional to me. Sounds like good ol’ fashioned revenge. And I suppose those assassination attempts on me was just business to eh? Nothing personal?”\n\nAVA shakes her head in dismay and looks up at the ceiling. Tears stream from her non-cybernetic eye.\n\n“You’ll never understand mutant…it…it should’ve been us…we…I’m sorry Alex…I’m sorry my father…I have ended up like you…trapped and surrounded by my enemies with only death awaiting me…forgive me…”\n\nStrangely, you almost feel sorry for AVA, putting her out of her misery is probably an act of kindness at this point. And so you do with a couple of well placed bullets.\n\n“(Sigh) Well AVA, if it’s any consolation, you did a lot of damage to us, a lot of damage…”\n\nWhen you exit, Lisa is still waiting outside, she looks like she’s deep in thought.\n\n“Yeah, the Savior’s dead and from what I can tell so are all the other Glow Children as well as most of your Shadow Horde…” you say to Lisa\n“Given the temporary mistrust both side had for each other, perhaps its for the best…perhaps this alliance needs to be dissolved and simply unified under one banner, one name, we are all mutants, no one is better than another, but we are all better than humans.”\n“So what’re you saying exactly?”\n“I’m saying we should be joined officially…with this latest annoyance out of the way, Zeropolis will soon be under our total control and then it will be time to handle the humans. I’m already a Queen, and you shall be my King and Adonis…shall be a Prince…heir to our new mutant dynasty.”\n\nYou’re a little surprised by this sudden suggestion\n\n“Whoa! What the hell? You want us to get fuckin’ married?”\n“Yes, do you not have feelings for me?”\n“Well uh…yeah I guess…I mean…”\n“Am I not the mother of your son?”\n“Well of course.”\n“Do you not see the wisdom in this action?”\n“I suppose, but…”\n“Then it’s settled…and be honest wouldn’t you like to be able to spend more time with your son? Spend more time with me…and be closer to you…”\n\nLisa’s manages to convince you in that way she does through her seductive embraces and strong commanding will. You swear she has some sort of mutant ability to control minds.\n\nA festive wedding is soon held after the celebration of the Glow Children’s destruction.\n\nTen years pass…\n\nTwenty years have passed and the unification of Zeropolis is complete. One City of unified mutants and you are their KING. What was once a warehouse has now been turned into a palace.\n\nWar against the humans is also in full swing. Lisa made sure that was the first thing on the agenda the moment Zeropolis was completely unified. The Combine wasn’t even prepared for the first few attacks, as entire towns were taken over with relative ease. Never before had mutants been so organized, and are now the greatest threats to them since the Cybernetic Evolution, worse even, since you can breed, and not just with other mutants…\n\nThe Combine and The Zero Dominion (That being its new name) fought for a long time, but The Combine lost mainly due to its own internal turmoil. After a couple years of your attacks the government collapsed and splintered into several factions. Some of those factions willingly surrendered to you. Human traitors were not unheard mainly because rule under The Combine was little better. It was a corrupt and decadent organization that bullied its citizens, while human subjects living under your occupation are treated fairly well as long as they know their place and they are certainly well protected from other humans like the outlaw scum who lurk in the wastelands. With the Combine completely destroyed, mutants now rule everything within the area ranging from towns to even the Ground Zero Shelters still containing their inhabitants. (Actually many of those genuinely thanked you for releasing them from those underground coffins! Lisa of course wasn’t surprised by the shoddy workmanship that went into most of them given that she used to work for the corporation)\n\nNow eyes of conquest look ever further, but despite all this, you’re a relatively benevolent dictator.\n\nThough Lisa often thinks you’re too lenient on the humans, and claims you must set a better example for Adonis who shall take over from you one day. Adonis is only a teenager, but has the arrogance of a god. The tests and training Lisa insists that he engage in continue, and have produced a superior specimen of mutanthood thus far. Already he is eager to shed the blood of humans, you sometimes have to tell him that he shouldn’t let something like that dominate his thoughts as it can lead to recklessness, but he’s very much like his mother despite the fact that you’ve had regular contact with him now.\n\nYour daughter Venus on the other hand is different. She’s still young, but even now you can see that she will be a very dissimilar person than her brother. While you’d think Lisa would want to spend time with her own daughter, she still concentrates only on Adonis. Leaving you to take up that role, but even that is only minimal as Venus often prefers spending time by herself. She reminds you of…well you. Over the recent years, you’ve often wished you could spend time by yourself like you used to, but that’s a rare luxury nowadays…\n\nBut heavy is the head that wears the crown and you have a host of concerns as of late to attend to and they only stack up. Hell, you don’t even know where to begin anymore. You begin to wonder if any of this is even worth it. You know you’re better than humans, but is constant ongoing warfare REALLY what you want?\n",
  "page 168": "You lower your rifle (But still hold on to it) and walk side by side with the cyborg who is surprisingly chatty, you also see it walks a bit irregularly, like it hasn’t been spliced together correctly.\n\n“Alex will be most pleased to see you; you’ll be the first human here in months!”\n“What happened to all the others?”\n“Oh well most of them have been improved like m-m-m-m.” the cyborg hits itself in the head before he stops stuttering “Like me, sir.”\n“Hmm, some improvement.”\n“Oh well, its not so bad. Alex promises to give us a tune up when he gets the necessary time, he is only one man after all. Some assistants would certainly help.”\n“So Alex is a surgeon?”\n“Well he’s not really. I mean he didn’t start out that way at least, but he’s completely self taught and trying to learn more each day! Sure there have been some failures, but there’s also been success! Why look at m-m-m-m.” the cyborg hits itself in the head again while you just shake yours. You can see this is going to be an interesting meeting.\n\n“So who were you before Alex…uh improved you.”\n“Oh I was a regular military man who guarded this base with no real identity. Just a name and a number really.”\n“And now?”\n“Now I’m known as J-34 and I protect Alex!”\n“That’s great… so everyone here is a cyborg like you?”\n“Just about. Most military personnel were friends with Alex before being renewed, so they were happy to be improved. The GZS personnel weren’t so enthusiastic about the idea, in fact they were mad that Alex discovered their top secret project. They tried to stop him, but they were stopped instead. Alex saw that the project would be pointless in trying to perfect it to use in a war that was going to be over in six minutes. Better that it should be applied to those that would surely survive the aftermath of that same war. Here we are, I’m sure Alex will want to hear all about the outside world, hey maybe he’ll improve you too!”\n\nYou enter an office where a man sits at a desk pouring over technical manuals and medical books. Two more cyborgs armed with some sort science fictionish weapons stand by him. There’s no way you could hope to kill him without them killing you as well. He looks up.\n\n\n“Ah a guest! Been a long time since we’ve seen anyone new…in fact I’m a little puzzled on how you even found this place, let alone entered it…you’re not GZS are you?” Alex says changing his pleasant demeanor in mid sentence.\n“No! Not at all! I’m here because the Colonel sent me. He says you and he are friends. Here. Here’s his ring and a letter he wrote to prove it. He’d also given me a security pass so I could enter this place.”\n\nAlex takes the ring and letter and inspects them both, before addressing you again.\n\n“Well it looks like everything’s legitimate. I shall trust you. Though I’m not sure I trust the Colonel. I never did trust him. He only wanted to use me so I could get access to high tech weaponry, but instead I found much more here! Much more than I ever told him! Ha ha! I hear him trying to radio in, wondering if there’s anyone here, I’ve been ignoring him. He and his group of right wing loonies are unworthy of being re-made. If they think they’re true survivialists then they don’t need the gifts that this base provides. All of it is mine, I EARNED this place and it shall be I who ushers in a new era. Not GZS, not the government and not the fucking goddamn Colonel!”\n\nAlex is obviously unhinged, you don’t know if he was always this way or got that way later, but it hardly matters, what’s of major importance is that you walk away from this meeting unscathed. You try to calm him down.\n\n“Whoa hold on, I don’t think the Colonel or any of his right wing loonies would want to be re-made.”\n“Nonsense, anyone with any sense of survival would want to be re-made if they new about what was being worked on here.”\n\nYou can’t help, but notice that Alex hasn’t done any improvements on himself…\n\n“However, I can see you don’t share that same short sighted thinking that the rest of those Compound cronies do. You are worthy of being re-made! In fact I would like to start now, I’ve been studying up on some new techniques and I would love to test them out. I think I could do a really good job this time, there will definitely be less acc…er complications than in the past.”\n\nThis is just getting worse. Now this nutjob wants to work on you.\n\n“Look, I don’t want to be re-made! I was just here to see if you were alive and scout this place out! Now that I’ve done that, I’m to return to the Compound!”\n“Oh well now that’s going to be a problem…I can’t risk you telling him what’s here.”\n\nYou really didn’t want to hear that.\n\n“Look, I’ll tell the Colonel that there wasn’t anything here, I can reason with him. You can even take my security pass to make sure I can’t get back in if you’re really worried. However, if he doesn’t hear from me, he’s only going to send more folks to this place.”\n“And what of it? They wouldn’t be able to get in and even if they could, his weekend warriors would be no match for Cybernetic Evolution!”\n“No, but they could just blow up the elevator trapping you down here forever, and you’ll never be able to leave to allow your genius to usher in the new era that you were talking about.”\n\nThat seems to relax Alex a bit, as always a little flattery goes a long way to ease an unbalanced mind.\n\n“Hmm, perhaps you make some sense, and you seem like a trustworthy sort…very well. I shall arrange for you to leave. Give me your security pass.”\n“Okay, and I’ll be needing the Colonel’s ring and letter back, so I can say I didn’t find anything here.”\n\nYou and Alex exchange items and he and his two cyborg guards escort you back to the elevator.\n\n“Goodbye, perhaps if we meet again you will be more receptive to being re-made. It’s a harsh new world, and you’ll soon wish you had an edge to survive it.” Alex tells you before you leave.\n\n“I’ll do alright.”\n \nThe elevator goes up and you’re back on the surface again where you make your trek back to the compound in just a few days. You notice there have been a few changes in the few days you’ve left. Namely there’s a still to make hooch. And you now have some working vehicles that been modified to run on hooch. The same still that people are making cheap booze from they’re also using it as fuel, which basically translates into the vehicles running on “garbage” given that’s what the booze is being made out of. Smells pretty bad, but whatever works. Though from what you heard some towns have been found to be running their vehicles on shit (animal AND human) so the smell could be worse. There’s been a couple deaths from some of the other recon missions, but for the most part everything else is normal.\n\nEveryone’s almost surprised to see you come back, Marina’s happy, Harry obviously isn’t. The Colonel though wants to see you immediately.\n\nSince you don’t owe any allegiance to some nutcase playing Frankenstein in an underground base, you tell the Colonel everything. You expect him to get mad at you, but he doesn’t.\n\n“(Sigh) Alex always was a bit unstable; I always wondered why the army never gave him a section 8. Anyway, what you’re telling me doesn’t surprise me, though I wish you could’ve gotten away without giving up that security pass. It’s going to be harder to get down there now.”\n“You still want to go down there?”\n“Of course! What you think I’m going to let Alex slowly refine and build up his cyborg army? Who do you think he’s going to attack first? No, we need to get rid of him NOW. I suppose we could blow up the elevator doors to gain access. Not like we don’t have the means to do that.”\n“Yeah, but don’t you run the risk of blowing up the entire elevator, and causing it fall and crash down the shaft? We wouldn’t be able to send anyone down there in an efficient manner. Let alone fighting off cyborgs who would cut us down with ease if we were trying to repel down the shaft or huddled together coming off the elevator, besides Alex might have left the elevator on his level given the recent visit of mine.”\n\nThe Colonel lets forth another sigh knowing that you make a good point, but frustrated as well.\n\n“You’re right, so what do you suggest we do then? Sit and do nothing with our thumbs up our asses?”\n",
  "page 289": "You think back to when you first entered Zeropolis and how you hoped that you’d somehow be as lucky or as radiation resistant as your grandfather was when he witnessed nuclear blast tests back when he was in the army. As it turns out you were, well lucky that is, the radiation resistance came later.\n\nDuring your entire stay in Zeropolis, you’ve always tried to do what you thought was best for you, but many times you’ve felt like you were railroaded into this path, and indeed sometimes you had little choice in some of your major decisions.\n\nHowever, ultimately they were your choices and even you have to admit you’ve done far better than you could’ve expected. Lisa’s a better wife than you really could’ve hoped for before the bombs turned the world into nuclear ash, let alone after the bombs. You son Adonis is obviously going to be a fine ruler someday, he certainly has all the necessary traits and if Venus is as much like you as she appears to be, she’ll do just fine. Their future is what’s important, and as such you have come to the realization that making sure they have a great empire to rule is the best thing you can give them. Not just for them, but for their children as well. You finally understand Lisa’s dedication to conquest and why she’s always pushed you to be a little more enthusiastic about it.\n\nSure she gets a bit intense as far as the human thing sometimes, but that’s just part of her personality. You never quite understood why she’s exactly so obsessed on the whole mutant superiority thing (Whereas you just take it for granted that you’re better and just leave it at that) especially given that she herself has never even had contact with another one since her transformation. (You have though, one thing that always seem to get her hot is when you recount your time when you were doing raids on Combine town during your alliance with the Cybernetic Evolution) You’ve always had a strange sort of relationship with Lisa, but it is love though, a weird form of it, but love nonetheless.\n\nPeople have been fighting wars and taking shit from others since the beginning of time, and from what you can tell they’re still doing it. All for various reasons. So your reasons are for love and family. There’s certainly more selfish and worse reasons.\n\nAfter coming to this epiphany you finally have eliminated any lingering doubts and reservations about anything you’ve ever done or will do in the future. You immediately go find Lisa who’s watching Adonis train against one of the few former Shadow Horde mutants left. He’s managed to take the giant down with his bare hands too, not many can make that boast, let alone at the young age he has. When you arrive in the gym, Lisa approaches you.\n\n“Well, I didn’t expect to see you until tonight. I know how you like to spend long periods of time by yourself… I always found that strange for someone in a position of leadership.”\n“Not really Lisa, people who rule are often isolated, however I have come to the realization that I’m not alone. The future of our dynasty is important, I see that now and I’m going to ensure what we’ve built doesn’t end.”\n\nYou think it’s the first time you’ve seen overwhelming joy in Lisa’s face, but she immediately hugs and kisses you. You think this is also the first time you’ve actually heard her say “I love you.” to you. Adonis stops his training and wonders what’s going on and that’s when you turn your attention to him and point your finger directly at him.\n\n“And YOU, you will be the next ruler! But if you want ANY chance of it, you’re going to have to beat the me first!”\n“Hah! You’re kidding right? I just beat an Ex-Shadow Horde mutant with my bare hands! I can easily take you on old man!” he laughs.\n“Think so? Show me what all your training has done then, don’t worry I’ll go easy on you, wouldn’t want to mess up that pretty face of yours, you sure you’re not my daughter?”\n“You’re going down old man!”\n“Not likely, now stop talking and hiding behind your mother’s skirt, mama’s boy!”\n\nThat one had the desired effect.\n\nUnsurprisingly your minor taunts make Adonis angry causing him to charge at you hard and you immediately drop to the ground and trip him. When he falls on his face you grab his arm and twist it behind him while putting your knee in his back.\n\n“See? You let yourself get too emotional and it threw off your game. You need to learn more about fighting than just the basics. I’ll make sure I’ll teach you that. Now get up.”\n\nFrom that point on you take a more active role in training Adonis. Particularly in the more psychological and strategic aspects of it. He learns quickly, and in time learns to reign in the arrogance and some of his mother’s views on humans, but he always retains his desire to fight. In the years to follow he joins the Dominion army and quickly rises through the ranks. Lisa is very proud and you are as well.\n\nAs for Venus, she of course remains her usual quiet self, though she does surprise everyone when she later joins the Dominion army as well, as a scout though. She turns out to be an excellent sniper.\n\nAs always there is resistance, but for the most part the Zero Dominion only grows larger under your rule.\n\n\nThirty years pass…\n\nFifty years have gone by since you first set foot in Zeropolis and you’re eternally glad you did. It could’ve only been destiny that guided you to what you thought was most likely a death zone, only to turn out to be the place where you would achieve greatness.\n\nYou remember how humans used to shoot mutants on sight mainly to discourage them from venturing far from Zeropolis, but now mutants now control a vast portion of territory, their population has grown much much larger, and half-breed mutants from humans are in large numbers as well. A new era is being ushered in for a newly evolved being that will eventually replace humanity.\n\nNever did you think that you’d actually live long enough to die peacefully in your own bed. But that’s what is occurring now, you feel the approach of death occurring and you have no regrets. Right now you’re surrounded by your family. Lisa, Adonis, Venus and their children as well. You can die knowing that you’ve made the world a better place for them.\n\nYou’ve made all of this happen and as you pass your throne to Adonis, while holding on to Lisa’s hand who sits by the side of the bed, you say your last words:\n\n“I love you all and finish what I started, my children …”\n",
  "page 170": "“Well I suppose you’re right in that we need to stop Alex, but blowing up the elevator still isn’t going to help, I suggest we hack the security system to gain control of it properly and then send down the invasion force and hope we can deal with the robots and cyborgs down there.” You reply.\n“Sounds like a better plan, I didn’t know you had so much computer experience though, let alone able to hack into a secret army base.”\n“Huh? I don’t. I mean, don’t you have people like that here?”\n“Excuse me, but you seem to be new here, hello welcome to the Compound…NO OF COURSE I DON’T I HAVE ANYONE LIKE THAT HERE! Sheesh! It’s not like we figured advanced computer hacking skills are going to be that useful when the world is blown back to the stone age! So you mean you don’t have the ability to pull off this amazing plan of yours?”\n“Well, not really, not to that degree at least…I suppose there’s just taking the panel apart and re-wiring it so it opens up for us though, you got any electricians or someone of that nature?”\n“Yeah a few, but I hope you do too, because you’re going to assist the team since you’re the idea man for all of this. After you clean out all the cyborgs and whatever the hell else Alex has built down there, remember to grab those weapons and come back. We’ll go back to occupy the base later. Now go select your team and whatever else you think you might need.”\n\nAfter asking for the names of the electronically “gifted” around the place, you go about following the Colonel’s orders and saying goodbye to Marina again, she looks more confident that you’ll return this time, you wish you could feel the same.\n\nWhen you and your team get to the base in a few days, you’re in for a little surprise. A medium sized robot is patrolling the courtyard. Looks like your friend Alex also dabbles in robotics as well as cybernetics. You and your team hide behind the outer wall when you all catch sight of it. Apparently Alex didn’t trust you any more than you trusted him, and looks like both of you were right.\n\n“Uh, what’s that?” one of your team members asks.\n“It’s a robot, what’s it look like?”\n“Well what’re we gonna do?”\n“Kill it! Everyone open fire!”\n\nYou have no idea if your bullets are going to penetrate its armor, but you you’re going to try anyway. Everyone fires upon the robotic being, which begins to shutter and spark, but returns fire and a bright burst of light strikes one of your team members and completely incinerates him.\n\n“Holy shit, get cover and keep firing!” you shout.\n\nThe rest of the battle doesn’t last too much longer, while your team continue to fire bursts at the machine while they dodge plasma blasts, you get enough time to toss a grenade at it and blow it to smithereens. Shards of burnt twisted metal lie all over the place.\n\n“Come on we need to open up that door, before something else comes out of the damn thing!”\n\nYou and a few others start working on the card reader, trying to get it open as fast as possible. You don’t even know how you’re going to rewire the damn thing; you’ll just keep doing something until something else happens! As it turns out you didn’t need to do anything, while you and few others are fumbling around, the elevator doors open. At first you think you it was you who opened them, but in fact it was Alex who was controlling the elevator from the bottom. Two heavily armed cyborgs exit and begin firing immediately turning most of your team into charred skeletons. You manage to just barely get away and duck behind one of the buildings. Fortunately they don’t seem to be very fast, so when they try to chase you, you toss a few grenades in their direction, blowing them up in the same manner you destroyed the robot, except a bit bloodier, given their human bits.\n\nYou come out of your hiding place and see nothing left of your team, they’ve all been killed. The elevator door is still open; you could enter and finish the job, or return to the Compound in failure.\n",
  "page 290": "You don’t really want this, you never really did. You feel like every decision you’ve ever made has either because you had no choice or because you felt influenced in some way. Well you’re in charge now and if you don’t want to wage an ongoing war with humans then you’re not going to!\n\nYou immediately call a halt to all further acts of aggression on human settlements. You say you’re going to concentrate on defending and holding on to what you have. Lisa isn’t too pleased with this decision. You argue that what is the point of it all since you’ve eliminated the greatest threat to mutants, while Lisa says as long as humans are around they’ll always be a threat to mutants. You’re not going to change your mind though; you’ve made your decision.\n\nAdonis naturally feels like you’ve cheated him out his chance to prove himself in true battle against humans. In the years to follow he joins the Dominion army and entertains himself by being cruel to the human subjects. One day in a human settlement called Ashtown, he goes too far and one of them actually fights back. In the ensuing struggle Adonis’ face is hit by a small explosion, severely disfiguring his once relatively human looking appearance. Now all that is left is a horrific skinless face and little of his remaining sanity. In retaliation he orders the complete destruction of Ashotwn. When Lisa hears of this she wants even more vengeance and goes over your head as well to order the destruction of another town called Cinderville, by the time you can call a stop to any of this, both places have been razed to the ground and its inhabitants butchered.\n\nPreviously the humans under your rule were scared just enough not to start an uprising, some of them were even loyal, you always made sure never to be unnecessarily brutal even though Lisa and Adonis would prefer otherwise; so what occurs next isn’t too surprising to you. These events as well as the liberties Adonis has been taking, has pushed them over the realms of fear and into hatred. You begin to have uprisings, and guerilla attacks all over the Dominion, some of the more fanatical ones even launch suicidal attacks on targets in Zeropolis.\n\nYou do your best to try to stop the attacks while at the same time trying to still be fair to the humans, but the time for that is long gone. Instead the mutant citizens just think you’re being too weak.\n\nMore years go by and you’re getting assassination attempts by other mutants calling for your blood. Parts of the Dominion begin to splinter as you unsuccessfully attempt to hold everything together. It’s just like what happened to the Combine. Now you you’re forced to become brutal just to keep everyone in line for a few months, but it’s too late, now nobody likes you, not even your family which has been apparent for quite some time, but one time it goes to the point of no return.\n\nOne night while you’re brooding to yourself in your private chambers, Adonis shows up before you with his own personal guards. You can’t say you didn’t see this coming as well.\n\n“Old man you are no longer fit to rule the Zero Dominion! I’m taking over!”\n“You think you are...you’re mother will be the one really running shit, because as far as I can tell you’re barely capable of staging a coup.”\n“SHUT UP! KILL HIM!” Adonis screams.\n\nYou might be older, but you’re still relatively quick. You dodge for cover as Adonis’ guards attempt to kill you. You pull your own weapon and with your usual deadly accuracy you blast every one of them, though Adonis has managed to sneak around behind you at this point. Being dramatic is his downfall as he attempts to slit your throat, but you manage to grab his arm and break it, before he can. He falls to the ground clutching his arm.\n\n“Stupid ass kid, don’t bring a knife to a gun fight!” you say standing up.\n“Yeah, and don’t talk when you have the advantage, old man!” Adonis retorts and a blade from his boot suddenly appears as he kicks up at your stomach, impaling you with it.\n“Fuck!”\n\nYou quickly dislodge yourself from the blade and stagger a bit before dropping your pistol. Adonis takes the advantage and side kicks you in the face, this time taking out one of you eyes. Oddly you don’t even feel the pain; in fact you’re beginning to feel pretty numb to everything right now.\n\n“Mom always said you were weak.”\n“Yeah, well I’m not the one who’s the mama’s boy…I think you should call her, you need all the help you can get.”\n\nThis little taunt throws Adonis off his game and he charges at you. You drop to the floor and trip him. When he falls face first to the ground you immediately shove your knee in his back and break his other arm.\n\n“Sorry son, but your name is Adonis, not Oedipus and you ain’t gonna be killing me.”\n\nAnd with that last statement you snap his neck.\n\nNow you start to feel the pain of your wounds, you’ve lost quite a bit of blood, but you’d probably be able to survive if you had the chance to get to the doctor, but you know you aren’t going to get that chance.\n\nLisa walks in with pistol in hand, and at this point you don’t even want to stop her even if you were in a position to do so.\n\n“You killed my poor son, he would’ve ruled…”\n“Think of it this way, now you can eliminate the middle man and just rule directly, just like you’ve always wanted, just like you did with the Shadow Horde…(groan) I think I’ll just rest here for awhile. Yeah that’s better.”\n“You’re going to die for what you’ve done!”\n“Yeah, I kind of figured that, look I don’t care anymore, don’t you see that? It’s been nothing but a fucking headache anyway. …now if you’re going to shoot, you go ahead, or just let me bleed to death because I just don’t care anymore.”\n\nLisa looks genuinely upset, and you don’t think it’s solely over Adonis. Even after thinking you’re unfit to rule or be her husband anymore, she’s still reluctant to kill you.\n\n“Goddamn it, what happened to you? Why couldn’t you have just done what I wanted? To create a dynasty to last forever!”\nAll I ever wanted was to live a peaceful life, well that didn’t happen for a variety of reasons, but I guess I can say it wasn’t boring. And there was the fact that I did get to meet you…Lisa don’t prolong this, just do it. It’ll be easier for all of us. Tell Venus I love her as much as I still love her mother.”\n\nLisa sheds a few tears and then carries out your request.\n\nSoon after your death Lisa takes over the Zero Dominion and does a much better job than you or Adonis could’ve ever done. In the years to follow, she restores order and quells all rebellions. She might’ve even brought in further territory had she not been assassinated by Venus, who always stayed quiet and in the background plotting and waiting for the right moment to strike. Strangely Venus never took over; instead she left Zeropolis and the Dominion altogether, letting it collapse into multiple civil wars until it destroyed itself.\n\nWhere she wound up is unknown, but being her father’s daughter, it was probably someplace quiet and isolated.\n",
  "page 172": "You take a deep breath and enter the elevator taking it down. As soon as it opens you step out and blaze away at the first metallic monster that pops from around the corner, hitting it critically in some vital component. In fact you’re doing okay all things considering, but as they say, it usually isn’t thing that you’re expecting that gets you.\n\nThinking you have a breather, you duck into one of the rooms to reload; unfortunately you feel a dart go into your back, before you enter it. You pull it out and see it’s a tranquilizer dart. Already you feel drowsy, and begin to collapse. You ban barely make him out in your current state, but Alex soon enters with a victorious look on his face, holding his tranquilizer gun.\n\n“Well, it looks like I was right to not trust you, but you’ll be able to repay me back soon enough. Trust me, you’ll thank me for this remaking.”\n\nDespite Alex’s claims you’re unable to do much talking at all after Alex remakes you, let alone thanking him. He basically designs you in such a way that only your basic brain functions remain. Just enough for you to obey simple commands such as “Attack the Compound”.\n\nObeying that command is the last thing you do, before you’re eventually blown to bits during Alex’s attack on the Compound.\n",
  "page 171": "Funny that you are about to suggest an idea to the Colonel that got you out of trouble with Alex in the first place.\n\n“No, I think you do have a good idea about stopping Alex, I saw first hand how crazy he was. Maybe we can’t actually get to him, but we could contain him.  We blow up the elevator like you wanted to do and then dump explosives down the shaft, it should collapse things enough that they won’t be able to leave, and we won’t lose any people.”\n“Ah, I like the way you think, but suppose they attempt get out, or rebuild the elevator or something?”\n“Well, we could leave a permanent detachment there to keep a constant vigil. I mean the surface part of the base is completely usable. That way we get an early warning just in case anything does try to come out.”\n“Interesting idea. Having two command centers would be a good idea, I was planning on expansion in the future, might as well start now. Should keep us alert as well. Can’t afford to get sloppy out here. Okay. We’ll go with that idea, and since you came up with it, you can oversee the operation. In fact consider yourself stationed there until further notice.”\n“What?!”\n“Hey I have to put someone there, you’ve done a good job so far and you have the best experience with the place so you can be in charge. Think of it as an honor son! I have a lot faith in you and I don’t have much in anyone.”\n“Well thanks, but wouldn’t someone like Harry be a better choice?”\n”Harry? Yeah, he’s got his uses, but I’d rather not have him in charge of anything important like this, no I want you and few others to go, in fact you pick them. I’ll let you know if I can afford to spare them.”\n“Well then I pick Marina right now.”\n“I expected that. Sure, if you can convince her to go. Just remember what you’re there for! Okay go pick out your team and gather what equipment you might need.”\n\nYou leave and tell Marina the situation immediately, she of course agrees to go with you, though she’s a little worried about being someplace with a bunch of cyborgs several feet underneath her, of course you’re worried about the same thing.\n\nYou pick out six more people of varying skills, but mostly people you were getting along with during your stay at the Compound. You don’t want to take anyone who you’re not going to get along with. The Colonel approves of your choice and gives you the okay, Harry looks positively jealous that he was passed over for you who just got here. In fact before you leave he tells you as much.\n\n“You fucking little pissant. You think because you’re all chummy with the Colonel that you’re his fucking second in command now?”\n“No, I…”\n“You’re goddamn right no! If anything happens to the Colonel I’M in charge of this shit! You better remember that fuckhead! Because if you’re still on my list when that occurs, you best pray to God that I at least lube your asshole after I rip off your pink panties and before I shove my foot up it and make your colon my permanent fuckin’ sock!”\n\nYou’re a little bewildered by the logic of this comment, you almost can’t be sure if he’s threatening you, or flirting with you. You don’t feel like arguing with him though since it won’t accomplish anything, besides if any good is coming from this, it’s getting away from him. You and your team leave.\n\n\nWhen you and your team get to the base in a few days, you’re in for a little surprise. A medium sized robot is patrolling the courtyard. Looks like your friend Alex also dabbles in robotics as well as cybernetics. You and your team hide behind the outer wall when you all catch sight of it. Apparently Alex didn’t trust you any more than you trusted him, and looks like both of you were right.\n\n“Uh, what’s that?” one of your team members asks.\n“It’s a robot, what’s it look like?”\n“Well what’re we gonna do?”\n“Kill it! Everyone open fire!”\n\nYou have no idea if your bullets are going to penetrate its armor, but you you’re going to try anyway. Everyone fires upon the robotic being, which begins to shutter and spark, but returns fire and a bright burst of light strikes one of your team members and completely incinerates him.\n\n“Holy shit, get cover and keep firing!” you shout.\n\nThe rest of the battle doesn’t last too much longer, while your team continue to fire bursts at the machine while they dodge plasma blasts, you get enough time to toss a grenade at it and blow it to smithereens. Shards of burnt twisted metal lie all over the place.\n\n“Come on we need to blow up that door, before something else comes out of the damn thing!”\n\nYou and the rest apply charges to the elevator door and run before it explodes. Just like you though, Alex doesn’t have the elevator on the surface anymore, it’s at the bottom, in fact its ascending right now!\n\n“Dump grenades down the fuckin’ shaft!”\n\nThis action is followed by running far away from the elevator, a large explosion, and then a large crash and another smaller explosion. You ask for a flashlight and peer down the shaft. Its smoking mess and from what you can tell, part of the structure collapsed in on itself. Nothing is going to be coming out of there for a long time. You’re about to radio in and tell the Colonel the news when another signal breaks in, its Alex…\n\n“So, that snitch told after all! I knew he wasn’t to be trusted! You can’t stop me! I’ll get out of here eventually! And I shall…”\n“Got news for you Alex, you’re talking to the snitch right now, and you won’t be going anywhere as long as I’m here. Enjoy your underground prison.”\n\nYou switch to another frequency and tell the Colonel who seems pleased, he tells you he’ll keep in contact with you on a regular basis and send more people when possible, in the mean time secure the place and get settled in.\n\nA few more weeks pass and eventually the initial nervousness disappears from everyone, Alex still breaks in ranting on your radio frequency every now and then, but you ignore him. In fact being at the base turns out to be more to your liking, there’s less people around, you’re in charge and you get to spend more time with Marina.\n\nA year passes…\n\nNot too much changes around the base (Which you now call Pandora which seems appropriate since you’re keeping in something that shouldn’t be let out!) a few more people are transferred here, supplies are delivered back and forth, but not much else happens. You get reports from the Compound every now and then, seems they’ve made progress with a few small towns that survived, but there are a lot of problems with lawless bandits running around. Reports have also mentioned strange mutated animals lurking about too. Sounds like they have everything under control so far though. The Colonel has the idea to trade with the towns and offer protection when possible. He hopes to get more people to join the Compound you imagine.\n\nYour orders are still the same, just guard Pandora, and make sure no cybernetic horrors are coming out. Sometimes you wonder if you shouldn’t be doing something else, indeed Marina seems to think so. Sometimes you forget she’s been training in all this survivalist shit longer than you have and has that “tame the wasteland” spirit more than you do.\n",
  "page 292": "100 years later…\n\nEmpress Hera cherished the little quality time she had to spend with her children. Right now she was telling them stories about their ancestors, those stories always seem to fascinate them. She remembers when she was their age though she was unbelievably bored, but now she of course had a better appreciation for them and what her predecessors did to make things easier for her.\n\n“…and that’s how your Great-great-great-grandmother Venus tracked down the evil human Ground Zero Survival head quarters and regained the stolen secret that created the Chosen.”\n“Were we always the Chosen mommy?”\n“No, Odin, at one time we were hunted down by the racist humans and called mutants. A derogatory term that humans used because they feared us, because they knew we were better. Of course to this day free humans still call us that and worse, but that will soon come to an end in time.”\n“Mommy, were the Chosen always united?”\n“Oh no Freya, there was a time when we fought amongst ourselves much like the humans, it was only due to the efforts of your Great-great-great-great-grandparents that united them. Of course that’s not to say we don’t have our disagreements every now and then, but as a single race we are united much more than the humans could ever hope to be. Even in the face of certain extinction they still slaughter each other. Is it any wonder that some of them wish to become Chosen? And of course we are benevolent to accept these requests with a simple injection. Why? Because we are evolved. We are better than they. We are the future.”\n“Yay!” Odin yelled in triumph causing Hera to smile.\n“Indeed. Now its getting late, you two run off to bed, I’ll tell you more stories about your history tomorrow.”\n\nAs Odin and Freya ran off to bed, Empress Hera returned to her regular duties, which her advisors were eagerly awaiting for her to do.\n\n“Empress, I have news from the frontlines. The newly restored human government is requesting a peace treaty.”\n“Are they surrendering?”\n“No.”\n“Then fuck ‘em. They obviously wouldn’t be suing for peace if they weren’t losing.”\n“Empress, I feel I should inform you that there’s been reports that they’ve been employing robots on the battlefield, cybernetic soldiers as well.”\n\nHera was suddenly reminded of old stories told to her about a battle in old Zeropolis with cybernetic life forms and how her ancestors defended the entire city from their attacks. If they could defend a mere city attacked on all sides by these things then she could certainly handle whatever the last gasp “secret weapon” that the humans hoped to throw at her.\n\n“I’m not worried. Proceed with the attack plan.”\n“As you wish Empress.”\n“Is that all?”\n“Actually yes it is.”\n“Oh, good then leave me, I wish for private time.”\n“As you wish Empress. The Dominion of the Chosen will prevail.”\n\nAfter her advisors left, Hera went down to the royal tombs. She’d heard that before it was the burial site for her family members, it was the place where her Great-great-great grandfather made the change into a higher being and became one of the Chosen. She stood in the center surrounded by great rulers of the past, and greatest of all was you, your sarcophagus next to your beloved Lisa’s and the inscription on it saying:\n\n“I love you all and finish what I started, my children.”\n\nHera rubbed the sarcophagus inscription with her hand and answered back.\n\n“I will great ancestor…I will.”\n",
  "page 173": "There’s no way you can take on the rest by yourself, at the very least you need to get reinforcements! You’d radio in, but one of the other team members was carrying it, and he was fricasseed. Plus you don’t want to be around if anymore of Alex’s creations come up. Time for a full scale invasion, looks like the Colonel was right.\n\nAnd that’s just what the Colonel tells you, when he’s chewing your ass out for losing valuable people and equipment in an attempt to go through with your plan. His respect for you is severely lowered, in fact the entire Compound’s respect for you is lowered. Harry makes every effort to taunt you, and even Marina becomes distant. (Obviously you weren’t the “man” she thought you were.) Your status in the Compound is pretty much nil, when the Colonel finally organizes an invasion party; you of course aren’t included.\n\nNow knowing another invasion attempt is probably coming, Alex really beefed up his defenses; the invasion force doesn’t even set foot into the base before getting blasted by superior cyborg weaponry. Reinforcements are called in, but they don’t help. The base is too well defended now. A retreat is called, and the Compound has to abandon its invasion indefinitely. In fact all exploration is called off; since the Colonel decides he can’t afford to lose anyone else. (One of the only reasons why you’re kept around) The Compound just becomes a “place” where everyone lives because it’s safer than living outside it. The ideas of “rebuilding” civilization are abandoned. Morale certainly isn’t what it used to be.\n\nOf course none of that means shit to Alex, who only steps up his plans for conquest.\n\nA year passes without another incident and then the day happens which you all hoped would never happen, but somehow expected it would. Alex’s army arrives, and what’s worse is they now outnumber you. Alex must’ve been capturing people in the wastelands or something. He’s also improved his abilities, they’re even tougher, and worse they’re faster.\n\nYou don’t have anywhere else to go, and this place is your home such as it is. You figure maybe you can regain some respect by defending the place.\n\nYou and the rest prepare to defend the Compound. Harry is predictably yelling orders at everyone, while the Colonel is attempting to boost morale with inspirational speeches. None of it really helps though when the first wave of cyborgs easily melt the gate into liquid metal and blast holes in the walls.\n\nThen they proceed to melt the people into liquid pulp, and blast holes in their bodies, you are no exception.\n",
  "page 176": "You decide that you got it made, why fuck with it? The rest of those at the Compound have to go on missions to fight bandits and go exploring possible hostile locations. You don’t need to do any of that. You’re in a nice safe isolated location where nobody ever comes except to drop off supplies every now and then. Even the fact cyborgs are trapped underneath you doesn’t bother you anymore. You continue your routine.\n\nFour more years pass...\n\nYou and Marina are still together, but for some reason, you don’t seem as close anymore. It seems like she’s been getting distant in the past few years.\n\nYou still get the harassing radio rant from Alex every now and then just to let you know he’s still alive along with his robots and cyborgs. You’re guessing he’s been surviving on rats and roaches down there.\n\nIt’s been five years since you first joined the Compound and there’s been a lot more changes there at least that’s what you’ve been hearing from the people transferred to Pandora.\n\nYou get less and less reports from the Compound itself other than its undergone a name change and due to its inclusion of a few towns now, its called the Combine and the Compound itself is called Fort Justice. You know about how the Colonel has gotten sick and seems to be getting worse as more time passes and how the population rate is growing, but it’s slow. The major theory is the elevated levels of background radiation are probably affecting fertility. (You wonder about yourself and Marina since she hasn’t once gotten pregnant in the five years you’ve been together) There have been more people sent here, mainly people that aren’t “cutting it” anymore at the Compound. In fact you’ve been hearing some interesting stories. One man in particular called Roger has spoken to you quite frankly about what’s been going on at the Compound some of it a bit alarming.\n\n\n“The fuckin’ Colonel? When he started getting sick that sonofabitch Harry started taking over more responsibility. Started doing shit HIS way, which was a lot more reactionary. I mean don’t get me wrong, I’m not some faggot peacenik, I’m all about creating a new strong society, like how America SHOULD’VE been, but fuck man. I’m not gonna kill children for no goddamn reason!”\n“What?! When did this happen?”\n“About a year ago! I was on a mission to this small town called Lost Springs and Harry was with us personally. They had a fresh underground supply of water, so we really wanted to gather them into the fold. Talks didn’t go so well though, so Harry went nuts and shot the fucking mayor of the town! Then he proceeded to tell us to start killing all the kids if they didn’t submit to us.”\n“And?”\n“Well I refused to do it, and some of the others didn’t either. A few did though, and after a couple of kids were killed. The rest of the townsfolk pretty much fell in line. Harry left the ones who were willing to kill at his command to occupy the place. He made up a damn story to the Colonel about how he HAD to do it and left out the shooting kids though. And the Colonel gets sicker and sicker, and Harry gets freer reign. Shit, if the Colonel wasn’t still alive I think Harry wouldn’t even be sending some people here, he’d probably be sending them all to the city.”\n“Wait, the city? There’s missions to the city? I thought those were stopped after the first few times that was attempted.”\n“Not anymore! Harry’s been sending a few people on his shit list to missions on the city. Harry says that there are still important resources to be gathered from there. Its bullshit, ain’t nothin’ there except fuckin’ mutants and radioactivity! I probably would’ve got sent there, but I lost my arm in an ambush, and the Colonel said I needed to be taken off of active duty and sent here. There’s a real mean motherfucker loyal to Harry called Damon, who goes on the city missions to ensure nobody tries to go AWOL. He’s fucking nuts, he loves going into the city; I think he actually gets a fucking orgasm.”\n“Where the hell is Harry getting all these new people, if he’s treating the towns so badly?”\n“I told you he’s been press ganging some of them and most are so beaten by that point that they just go along with it, but he’s also been subduing some of the raider scum! That\nDamon is one of those fuckers. Instead of killing them all like we should be doing, he’s been recruiting them into the Combine! These degenerates are usually the ones he uses for occupation since most of them don’t have any qualms about killing anything that moves and they’re used to terrorizing towns.”\n“Holy shit, I’ve never heard about all this before.”\n“I’m telling you, you’re lucky you got assigned here when you did, because you\nwould’ve been going to the city. The only thing keeping you safe is the Colonel who insists you stay in charge of this place; I don’t want to think about the day when the Colonel finally croaks. Shit, I might just leave and take my chances, one arm be damned. YOU might want to think about leaving as well, because chances are Harry’s going to be turning his attention towards you when that day comes.”\n“I still don’t see what the hell I did to him, he’s hated me since day one.”\n“Well, you got the Colonel’s attention and his respect. You got a command position of your very own base, and most importantly you got Marina. He’s always liked her. You didn’t know?”\n“Well she did mention one time that he came on to her in the past, well anyway, it hardly matters why he hates me I guess. What matters is I gotta think about how I’m gonna deal with this problem in the future.”\n\nSuddenly one of your assistants comes in and has something to report. Something you really don’t want to know after having been given the recent information by Roger.\n\nThe Colonel has died, Harry has taken complete control of the Combine and his first order is for YOU to return to Fort Justice for reassignment.\n\nLooks like you’ll have to be thinking fast.\n",
  "page 277": "You figure you’ll give it some time; you’re not in a hurry to go anywhere.\n\nA week later and you wake up to a little mutant getting ready to push you to see if you’re awake, you immediately wake before he can do anything, slam him to the ground and put your knife to his throat.\n\n“Hey! Stop! I’m on your side!” he gasps.\n“Oh? What the hell are you doing here? Did the Captain finally decide to send me some help again?”\n“The Captain’s dead!”\n“He’s fuckin’ dead?”\n“Yeah! He got assassinated by some big ass motherfucker! Anyway that’s why I was sent to get you! You’re next in line to take charge.”\n“Wow. I would’ve thought someone would’ve just taken power themselves and left me to rot out here.”\n“Well, I think a couple of people had that idea…but then they realized the job wasn’t worth it. The Shadow Horde has been taking the offensive ever since Captain Salazar insisted on pursuing them in their sewers. We need a leader to get us out of this mess and you’re the only one we have!”\n\nSee you knew no good was going to come of this.\n\n“Alright, let’s see how much shit we’re in…”\n\nYou make your way back to Zeropolis and the Dust District is showing signs of battle, which is difficult to do since the place was a wreck to begin with. Dead bodies are being moved out of the street and the people look hopeful that you can somehow get them out of this mess.\n\nFirst thing you do is order a complete pull out of the sewers and reinforce your defenses in the Dust District. There’s no point in pursuing an enemy that’s lived in the damn sewers for years and knows them like the backs of their hands. Right now you need to regroup after the losses Salazar has incurred due to his recklessness.\n\nSecond thing you do is order no more attacks on Combine towns, you can’t afford the man power and you didn’t like allying with the Cybernetic Evolution anyway. However, another shipment of weapons was already on its way when you enact this order. The cyborgs who arrive wonder why they haven’t heard any reports of mutants attacking the Combine. Seeing that this alliance is over anyway. You immediately have the cyborgs killed (Which is easier than you thought it would be) and keep the weapons to help your own struggle.\n\nA couple more cyborgs arrive a month later probably to investigate what happened to their fellows, and you have them killed as well. Your hope is that the CE will think they’re losing them to Combine ambushes and will eventually just forget about you. And apparently they do because no more cyborgs are sent. You just hope the CE doesn’t win against The Combine.\n\nEventually you manage to restore relative safety to the Dust District, its not safe like it once was though, but at least it isn’t on the brink of disaster due to Salazar’s mad plan. Being in charge isn’t exactly a fun job, and its obvious why to as why nobody wanted to do it. Still the people see you as a savior of sorts and generally like you as a leader.\n\nThe warehouse that you live in, has been converted into the new head quarters, though you still live in the secret underground part that only you have access to…well at least you thought you did.\n\nOne night you wake up in your room to a very pale woman by your bed. Obviously she’s a mutant, but she’s somehow managed to avoid the ugliness and scaring that goes along with it, though she does have part of her face covered. She holds a pistol, but seems to be inspecting the place more than paying any attention to you.\n\n\n“Boy this was so long ago and another life time…please don’t go for your gun, I’m here to talk…my, you are a pretty one. Almost human looking…almost.” she says finally paying attention to you.\n“How the hell did you get past the guards?” you answer calculating how quickly you might be able to reach her before she can get off a shot.\n“This war between our respective groups has taken a toll on both of us for quite sometime…I would ask that we finally have peace.” She says ignoring your question.\n\nYou gather she’s from the Shadow Horde, though you’ve never seen one like her. She’s not brimming with muscles or trying to rip your head off for one thing. (And somehow she actually smells nice and unsewer like!) She is exuding a weird aura though, like you have a great desire to follow whatever she says. It’s difficult to shake off these effects, but you try to keep a level head.\n\n“Peace? You’re ones always coming out at night to eat people! We were just trying to defend ourselves!”\n“…yes I have come to understand that now…and I appreciate your desire to exist. You have held out against us for years and accomplished much within that time. However I would say that your most recent attack on us was most definitely equally as brutal. You came into our sewers…our home and murdered innocent women and children, decreasing the ranks of our future warriors and birth givers. You came in using weapons of unparalleled power and destruction, unleashing blinding rays of light, incinerating at a touch.”\n“Yeah, well like I said, YOU started it…however that recent attack wasn’t my idea. I thought we shouldn’t spread ourselves out so thin.”\n“Yes, I’m aware of that, your Captain Salazar is dead and you have taken his place, which is why I feel I can talk to you about coming to you about putting an end to this conflict once and for all. I know of your deeds and you seem to be a lot more rational and reasonable than your predecessor. Anyway, I’ve come to the conclusion that this conflict is only going to harm us in the long run. We have to think about the future. The future of mutant kind relies on us no longer fighting each other. I thought survival of the fittest was enough when I first embraced my evolution, I believed that only the strong should be allowed to rule…but now I see that isn’t enough if we wish to thrive, we have to unite.”\n“What exactly are you getting at?”\n“Oh come on, you know that we’re the next stage of evolution. Humanity is the past, we’re the future.”\n“Hmmm, I think I know some cyborgs that feel the same way.”\n“Ah yes your cybernetic allies who you temporarily allied with, only to ruthlessly back stab later. Obviously they aren’t the future if they needed your help to defeat some humans. Listen to me, this City just isn’t divided between the Zeropolis Guard and the Shadow Horde you know…there are other factions. You just never come on conflict with them because you’re sectioned off in one corner of the City constantly fighting us and never able to spread out effectively. All these factions fight each other and that’s not counting the Ferals. I’m proposing that we could take the first steps in truly uniting Zeropolis. We could first approach in friendship, and if that regrettably failed, we could take by force. Who could stop us? The Shadow Horde has a higher birth rate and the numbers, while the Zeropolis Guard has the resources. You’d attack on the surface and we could attack from below. We could rebuild the world in our image.”\n\nThis rant is followed by her putting down her pistol, climbing on to your bed and seductively crawling closer to you, while taking off her strange protective mask revealing that the rest of her face isn\u0027t all scarred or mutated either. You feel really compelled to give in to her, and it’s not just the fact that it’s been awhile since you’ve been with a “human looking” chick. It’s whatever aura she’s exuding. It must be some sort of weird mutant ability she developed, but even though you’re aware of it, that doesn’t make it any less likely for you to want to resist. She’s making a point you haven’t considered before…you’re in a position of power, why not use it effectively?\n\nHer face is an inch away from yours and the only thing you can sputter is…\n\n“What’s your name?”\n“I’m known as the Queen by the Horde, but you can call me Lisa.” She replies before kissing you passionately.\n",
  "page 155": "This ungratefulness doesn’t exactly help you NOT become a dictator…\n\nYou saved the Combine, you saved civilization, you fucking saved humanity, you aren’t going to let it fall apart after all the shit you’ve been through. Not after you finally believe in it.\n\nUsing the newly acquired technology from the cyborg base you establish a more intimidating presence in the Combine towns. Having depleted most of their fighting power during the CE War they really can’t do much to stop you. There are a few initial protests, but a few executions squash any hint of rebellion.\n\n\nFive years pass…\n\nIt’s been ten years since the bombs dropped and you first entered Fort Justice when it was only known as “The Compound”. Of course Fort Justice goes by the name Fort Bane\n\nExpansion eventually occurs again, in a less diplomatic way now though. Typically the option is given for the town to submit peacefully to the Combine, or else it will be incorporated by force. The first town to suffer this fate of the new Combine ruthlessness is that old remote town you found nine years ago, Lost Springs.\n\nThe next one is a distant place called Ashtown. They put up a good fight, but eventually they too fall and put under martial law. When you come across them, you even start forcing open the underground Shelters that were created by GZS and incorporate the misguided souls who decided to hide during the nuclear holocaust under your ever expanding territory. Most of those folks put up little to no resistance. While they were cowering under the Earth YOU were surviving and making the blasted world a safer place for humanity.\n\nDespite the whispered discussions among everyone wishing you were dead, nobody actually does anything. The reason? The same as always. Your way works and has shown results.\n\nYes you’ve had to be brutal; yes you’ve had to make some harsh decisions, but you’ve done it for the greater good. You’ve completely eliminated lawlessness within most areas, as most of the nearby raiders have asked for Combine citizenship since it’s actually more profitable to be a soldier than a bandit. You gladly accept them. (Amusingly they’re some of the most loyal citizens) Trade thrives, and the only thing the Combine citizens need to fear is YOU.\n\nThe Combine is no longer a collection of small towns and a fort, it’s an Empire and it can only grow. You’ve made all this possible, yet you know it is only you who can hold it together. You begin to ponder successors and while you know there are many who would covet your position, you also know that none of them are worthy. Its times like this that you wish had a child with Marina. Someone who could carry on the divine right as it were. As you know Marina’s never once gotten pregnant in all your years with her, but you wonder if it’s you, for all you know maybe that trip to the city didn’t make you sterile. Maybe SHE’S sterile.\n\nYou wonder…\n",
  "page 158": "You’ve undergone a lot of changes after the bombs hit. Many changes. Not all of them for the better, but there’s still one thing that hasn’t changed, and that’s your love and loyalty to Marina. She’s been there with you from day one. You’re not going to betray that for the thin hope of creating some bastard that probably won’t do as good a job as you anyway. Besides, regardless of Marina’s fertility, you’re damn sure you’re sterile anyway, you’re just still glad your balls didn’t turn green and shrivel up after your trip to the city.\n\nSometimes you get so wrapped up in your Empire that you forget to spend time with those who are REALLY important.\n\n“Fuck it, I’ll be dead anyway. Really what the hell do I care who takes over?” you mumble to yourself and go spend some time with Marina. In fact from this time forward you vow to take more time out to spend with Marina, she seems very happy with this new attitude.\n\nOddly this revelation makes you slightly more agreeable and as a result some of the more restrictive laws are lightened in time. The average Combine citizen is a little happier as a result. (Though mostly all of them still think you’re a son of a bitch)\n\nTen more years pass…\n\nTwenty years since the bombs hit, and you’re the head of the largest known area of civilization. Hard to believe sometimes.\n\nYou’re thinking about this on your death bed. You’re very sick and the best physician you have doesn’t know what it is As usual, you’re convinced it has something to do with that trip to the city so long ago, and you’re probably right. Radiation shit is probably finally catching up with you. If Harry wasn’t a pile of rotten bones underground, you’d kill him again for sending you to that fucked up place.\n\nRight now you’re surrounded by advisors, military leaders and doctors, but right now you just want all of them to leave except Marina.\n\n“But…but whose’s taking over after you die?” one of them asks.\n“Goddamn it I ain’t dead yet! But if you don’t get the fuck outta here I’m gonna make sure I outlive YOU! Now leave!”\n\nSoon you’re left alone with Marina, who stays with you until the end.\n\n“Well it is a valid question, who is going to take over?” Marina asks.\n“Why don’t you do it? I mean I’ve never understood why you never wanted it, you’re certainly capable.”\n“Maybe…but I prefer to be behind the scenes I guess…you know there’s a lot less assassination attempts on the puppet master rather than the puppet.” Marina half-jokes.\n“Ha ha, well, I hope you find another.”\n“Never. I’ll never find another like you.” she says touching your face.\n\nYou and Marina are just silent as you look at each other for awhile. Finally you begin to close your eyes and feel one last kiss.\n\nAfter composing herself, she exits the room to inform the top brass of the news. They of course are like vultures fighting over scraps.\n\n“So did he say who was taking over?”\n“Is it me?”\n“No! It’s me!”\n“What did he say?”\n\n“Whoever can hold it.” Marina answers and walks off.\n\nThe years that follow your death aren’t pretty for the Combine. A civil war occurs as several factions vie for control. Eventually it collapses into petty warlord fiefdoms. Your accomplishments are soon forgotten as other would be dictators try to establish their own “legacies”.\n\nAs for Marina, she moves on from the Combine after your death to parts unknown, always carrying your ashes in an urn with the inscription:\n\n“I’ll never find another like you.”\n",
  "page 157": "The power has gone to your head in such a way that you’ve finally crossed that one line that was your downfall.\n\nYou order your troops to scour the Combine for the women known to be fertile and to bring them to Fort Bane all for the purpose for you to pursue some delusional notion of spawning a successor. The fact that tearing most of these women away from their established families doesn’t make you anymore popular. Of course that doesn’t bother you. The fact that you’ve basically bullied these women into submitting to you doesn’t make you anymore popular. But again that doesn’t bother you either.\n\nWhat should bother you is that Marina finds out very quickly what you’re doing. She’s very hurt by this infidelity. She’s stood by you from the very beginning, indeed she was the whole reason why you’re in the position you are in the first place, and now you’ve treated that sacred bond and loyalty like it never meant anything to you.\n\nPerhaps if you had addressed this to Marina, she MIGHT have even understood your desire and allowed you to proceed with your plan to a limited degree, she is a pragmatic sort after all. But you didn’t even do that, instead you made her an embarrassment as you carryon with other women some of which are little more than common whores, in fact you never get ANY of them pregnant, which pretty much confirms that you WERE sterile all along.\n\nOf course by this time you’re so wrapped up in your new decadent activities that you forgot why you were doing it in the first place. This new reckless and careless behavior does not become you, and Marina has finally had enough of it. Part of her may still even love you, but she’ll not be made a fool of and treated like this.\n\nOne night, while you’re eating a meal, you take a large swig of water. It tastes funny at first, but you dismiss it since funny tasting water’s not exactly too unusual. You just order another bottle of it to be brought to you…then you start to feel dizzy.\n\nYou stand up only to collapse on your dining floor. One of your servants goes to help, but then Marina appears to tell him to stop.\n\n“Ma…Marina? What’s going on?” you say as her figure begins to get blurry.\n“A change. You always wondered who would take your place, and I’ve decided that I’m the only one worthy enough to do it. Don’t worry, The Combine will live on, even if you will not. At least that was one thing you did right. I’m very sorry it had to end this way…I take no pleasure in this…but you can’t betray your king maker without some sort of consequence. I’ll try to remember the good times… Goodbye.”\n\nAnd with your last breath, Marina kicks you in the face.\n",
  "page 278": "You know when you’re not wanted. If your help is no longer appreciated then fuck it, you’ll miss your home, but you can find another. In fact maybe it’s for the best, if Salazar was calling people back, then maybe the Shadow Horde was winning and you certainly don’t want to be living there with them in charge.\n\nYou know that being a mutant, you won’t be liked among humans either, (Especially since you’ve been attacking them!) but maybe that isn’t the case everywhere. The Combine isn’t everywhere and their policies against mutants might not be the norm in other parts of the country. Hell, even without the Combine around there’s still the Cybernetic Evolution that you don’t trust.\n\nIn fact this whole area is fucked. Time to leave!\n\nWith this in mind you begin to walk, not knowing where you’ll end up, but definitely someplace better.\n",
  "page 280": "You have no desire to resist her advances and you totally give in to consummate this new alliance in a very special way…\n\nAfterwards you and Lisa get to know one another a little better. It’s funny that she finally returned to the GZS research outpost after all these years. At the time you were kicking Owen’s ass to take refuge here, she was attacked and nearly killed by Ferals and had to hide for several days struggling to survive. She mentions how she nearly died, how she got sick, how she came to accept the changes in her body, and how she managed to unite the sewer dwelling mutants.\n\nYou and Lisa talk about how you do both feel a sense of superiority to humanity, though it would seem Lisa has felt this way for a lot longer than you have and has stronger feelings about it, whereas you never really thought about it until you were actually killing Combine members. Indeed she does have a stronger feeling of only the strong should survive mindset, though that might be due to the harder path she had when trying to survive during those first few years.\n\nYou and Lisa begin to make plans for unifying Zeropolis. It isn’t widely accepted at first, as there are hard feelings on both sides. Your side is willing to stop the fighting, but their a little leery of an alliance. However, your standing is good so you don’t suffer outright rebellion, just a lot of grumbling. Lisa’s side is even less receptive; you honestly don’t know how she manages to keep those big hideous freaks in line even if she does have mutant pheromones and a strong force of will. As it turns out, the Shadow Horde for the first time splits and bickers among itself. Lisa manages to keep control of most of it, but not without an underground civil war.\n\nAfter all the smoke clears, the Shadow Horde and the Zeropolis Guard (Which you’ve renamed the Zeropolis Legion) maintain a shaky alliance.\n\nFive years pass…\n\nTen years have passed since you decided that going to the City would be a great place to find supplies…\n\nUnification of Zeropolis has been going as planned, but its still slow going. Most of the Ferals still alive have managed to overcome their relentless need for violence and food, but that doesn’t mean they are any nicer. The Shadow Horde has more success with those types as great display of strength, intimidation and fear work well. On your end you’ve managed to employ more peaceful means of incorporating the less hostile groups of mutants, such as restoring power to their areas and rebuilding. (The messenger rat system for long range communication even works well now)\n\nYou and Lisa could be considered “together” but it’s a distant relationship. She runs her part, you run your part and every now and then you get together. She has some sort of feelings for you, but she’s very much in her own world sometimes. Though the same could be said for you, but you do have feelings for her as well.\n\nLisa has also had your child. (Predictably 9 months after your “agreement” to the alliance.) A son, though you don’t get to see him too much, mainly because Lisa wants him to be closer to her. In fact you get the impression one of the reasons she had sex with you was in order to have a fairly “normal” looking child. She called him Adonis. It would seem that for all her talk on mutant supremacy, she still holds the “human” standard of beauty in high regard, (though to be honest so do you!)  She’s already training him to be self-sufficient with minor “tests” she sets up in the sewers; however despite this rather harsh training Lisa is very protective of Adonis.\n\nThe main faction standing in the way is one that has somehow gained momentum relatively recently over the last few years. A cult of mutants called the Glow Children, have taken over a great portion of Zeropolis through their weird faith. They follow a leader calling themselves the Savior. In your experience, groups with any type of religious faith behind them are never willing to negotiate and they aren’t an exception. They are utterly fanatical and devoted to their cause. They also engage in attacks from the sewers as well, causing you to believe that ex-Shadow Horde members fill their ranks. They’ve made their headquarters (or Cathedral as it were) at the old hospital.\n\nYou and Lisa are supposed to meet tonight with the rest of your respective cabinet tonight to determine how to best approach the Glow Children problem. You’re walking out of your headquarters with your guards when from out of the street a very very LARGE creature appears with the biggest fucking gun you’ve ever seen. Its resemblance to humanity is superficial even by Shadow Horde standards. You haven’t seen ANYTHING like this before.\n\n\n“Goddamn it Lisa what the fuck are your people doing!? You’re supposed to be defending that area!” you yell to yourself ducking back inside your headquarters and lying flat. The creature’s weapon rips through the door and the walls, killing many of your men. You hear gun fire outside followed by screams.\n\nYou know damn well it’s probably going to laugh at normal weapons so you run to grab those old CE weapons you haven’t used since the Alliance. Time to use those plasma guns again.\n\nThe creature breaks through the remaining bit of wall ignoring the bullets flying into its back, a Shadow Horde member presumably coming from the sewers jumps on it and stabs it in the head, but the giant aberration only grabs him and breaks his neck with a squeeze of his own enormous hand and throws the lifeless body through the nearby wall. You’ve never seen a Shadow Horde member treated like such a mere annoyance, and for once in a long time you really are scared.\n\nYou grab a plasma gun while the creature is still preoccupied with your guards doing their best to bring it down and that’s when you fire a hot bolt of plasma into its massive body, again, again, and again, until the damn weapon overheats and burns your hands, causing you drop it. Fortunately you’ve melted enough of its internal anatomy to cause it to finally collapse and die.\n\n“Alright what the fuck IS that thing?!” you shout wincing from the pain in your hands.\n“It’s a fucking big ass freak, that’s what it is.” One your men says. “You don’t think it’s a Horde member do you? You think they…”\n“No, no, shit I hope not. Besides I just saw it kill a Horde member with its bare hands like it was nothing, never seen that before. Might’ve been an Ex-horde member at one time though.”\n\nAnother one of your soldiers comes in through the hole in the wall and has more news for you.\n\n“Just got word from one of the horde, they got a similar attack on their Queen. Don’t worry though, she’s alive and so is your son. She said she’ll be arriving soon.”\n\nThat relieves you on several levels; you were sort of worried about them even if you all aren’t exactly a proper family unit. You and some of the others inspect the body of the fallen creature. Damn thing is huge, but what disturbs you more is the fact you’re seeing cybernetic implants…not to mention its weapon is pretty high tech stuff, similar to the same ones you received from the Cybernetic Evolution…\n\n“Oh shit, we got cyborg mutants.” You say.\n“What? But how? I mean…last we heard The Combine won that war. Just barely, but they won.” One of your soldiers replies.\n“Yeah, well it looks like there were survivors and they probably want revenge on us and what better way of doing that then by helping our enemies? (Sigh) the only good thing is that they can’t possibly be able to have access to a lot of this high tech stuff anymore; they don’t even have the means of manufacturing it since we own the factories. They’re probably just using scraps and pieces they managed to take with them after the beat down they suffered from the hands of the Combine.”\n\nThough those “scraps and pieces” can still do a lot of damage, and that’s not even counting the regular fanatical cultists. You’ll really have to get this attack plan with Lisa organized quickly. Suddenly you hear MORE sounds of battle! The Glow Children have sent more of their suicidal attackers to wreak havoc in your territory, most likely attempting to get to you though. Your guards suggest you descend down into you private quarters for protection, until Lisa arrives.\n",
  "page 161": "You volunteered and you’re going to see it through, might not be that dangerous as you think especially if the place is indeed abandoned.\n\nYou spend a few days crossing over hills and some plains. For awhile you think someone’s following you, but never see a soul, actually you’re wondering about the Geiger counter readings more than anything, but you’re guessing there wasn’t any nuclear blast the direction you’re going. You also guess that seeing trees up ahead is also a good sign. You would’ve dressed yourself in a radiation suit, but the Colonel kept insisting it wouldn’t be necessary and for the mission that Harry was sending some of the others on would need them more.\n\n“Shit! I forgot to take a radio!” you say to yourself finally realizing that it would’ve been nice to radio in to the Compound if you had something important to report, like being unable to enter the base because snipers were shooting at you.\n\nHappily that doesn’t seem to occur when you finally arrive. You almost aren’t even sure if you’re at the right place at first. The Compound is bigger, then again this place probably has an extensive underground, and as the Colonel said, it was more like a research facility than a proper military base.\n\nStill there’s something a little weird about all this, it seems like security would be of major importance for a place like this, yet there’s nobody here guarding the outside and you just walked through open gates. Maybe the place is abandoned, but they could all be underground though, (That would certainly be more sensible than wandering around exposing themselves to radioactive wind…)\n\nThe surface offices and barracks don’t look like anyone left in a hurry; in fact a lot of the barracks still have their equipment. (You take some extra ammo for your assault rifle) You search through some of papers you find in the offices, but there’s nothing of any importance. Just mundane status reports of personnel guard duties. You find a few letters with GZS logos on them, but again nothing telling you much.\n\nNothing else for it, but to go underground. You approach the solid metal structure at the far end of the base. Looks like an elevator door with an ATM machine near it. There’s a slot and some button, so you’re guessing this is where you shove your security pass that the Colonel gave you. Hope it works or you came all this way for nothing. You slide the pass in the slot.\n\n“Identification recognized. GZS wishes you a pleasant day in all your endeavors sir!” a chipper female voice sounds as the elevator door opens.\n\nNot exactly what you were expecting, GZS must’ve had more input here than the Colonel thought. You’re a little nervous as you press the elevator button down, you expect the worst. The elevator eventually reaches its destination and opens up to a corridor. You cautiously exit. You don’t get far when a cybernetic being comes from around a corner and points its arm at you, which is doubling as a weapon of some sort, one that would blow a big hole in you.\n\n“Lower your weapon and please come with me sir. Alex will want to see you. Any attempt to attack or escape will be met with extreme use of force.”\n",
  "page 281": "As lovely of a creature she is, she’s been the one leading your current enemy for years. She’s most likely trying to lull you into a false sense of security to kill you; you won’t allow yourself to fall for it.\n\nAs Lisa kisses and grinds into you, you muster all your strength and grab her to roll her over so that you’re on top and firmly in control.\n\n“Ohhh…okay…if that’s the way you want to do this, I don’t mind.” Lisa says and for a brief moment you think she might’ve been telling the truth about the alliance, however you go through with your plan.\n\n“Sorry baby, but I could never trust you. Maybe next life.” You reply and snap her neck with one quick twist.\n\nAfter the deed is done you sit by the bed for quite some time by her lifeless body. You really wish you hadn’t felt the need to do that, but given the fact that you’ve been the perpetrator of as well as a victim of betrayal in the past you felt you had no choice. Still, you always wonder what if…\n\nFive years pass…\n\nTen years have passed since you decided that going to the City would be a great place to find supplies…\n\nAfter the death of Lisa, the Shadow Horde became disorganized and eventually began to fight amongst themselves. They became much less of a direct threat, and as head of the Zeropolis Legion (As you renamed it) you were able to make the Dust District relatively safe once again. The idea of taking over the entire City was never something you want to pursue, so you just concentrated on building up the Dust District, however events conspire against you from living out a relatively conflict free life.\n\nRecently over the last few years, a cult of mutants called the Glow Children, have taken over a great portion of Zeropolis through their weird faith. They follow a leader calling themselves the Savior. In your experience, groups with any type of religious faith behind them are never willing to negotiate and they aren’t an exception. They are utterly fanatical and devoted to their cause. They turn out to be worse than the Shadow Horde (In fact they also engage in attacks from the sewers as well, causing you to believe that ex-Shadow Horde members fill their ranks.) They’ve made their headquarters (or Cathedral as it were) at the old hospital.\n\nThey attack the Dust District relentlessly, but the most disturbing thing you notice is how some of them carry high tech weaponry similar to the kind that you used to fight the Shadow Horde. Later you see some of the bigger Glow Children fitted with cybernetic implants. You know that the Combine won the war against the Cybernetic Evolution, but it would appear at least one of their number survived and are obviously remembering your past treachery. The day of reckoning is soon at hand.\n\nEventually one day while you’re arranging yet another plan to take back parts of the Dust District you’ve lost control over, your head quarters is attacked by several of the biggest mutants you’ve ever seen. Many of them are of the cybernetic variety armed with weapons of devastating power that make quick work of your elite guards.\n\nAs you make your futile last stand with a plasma gun, one of the giant aberrations takes two shots to the chest and still manages to pick you up and rend you limb from limb with minimal effort on its part.\n",
  "page 163": "You make a mad dash for the gas station, as bullets just miss your feet and head. The Colonel was thankfully right, they are weekend warriors. The problem you notice now, is there’s a crossfire, yet another spy is shooting at you from the other side as well, which means it’s a good thing you moved from your position when you did.\n\n\nYou manage to get to the gas station; the shelves have practically been stripped of anything that might be edible or useful. That doesn’t matter right now as bullets begin penetrating the already broken glass windows. You hide behind the counter as you hear them advance on your position.\n\n“Yeah, he’s hiding inside, we better be careful. Go around and see if there’s a backdoor.” You hear one shout.\n\nOne thing working in your favor is they obviously aren’t too bright, now you know one’s going to come around the back. You also know one of them is coming through the front door since the tell tale signal bells that jingle when customers used to enter make a noise. You immediately stand up and unleash a burst of hot lead into one of your ambusher. He falls in a bloody heap, then you run towards the backdoor and when you see it just barely creek open, you let fly another burst. The slumping of a lifeless body is heard and you confirm the kill when the wind blows the door open again to reveal a body lying on the ground outside.\n\nYou duck down again and scramble around the corner when your last assailant suddenly pops out from that same back door and nearly tears your head off with a shotgun. Victory is yours though when you point your assault rifle around the corner and just fire it, hoping you hit him, you do you hear that always satisfying drop of another body.\n\nAfter killing all of your enemies you begin to search their bodies, taking what you’ll surely need. On one you find a radio, for a moment you wonder how the hell you forgot to take one of these with you, then you remember it doesn’t really matter since you never went to the base. You hear a familiar voice coming in right now.\n\n“Leonard! Come in you dickhead! You better gimme some good news!” Harry shouts.\n\nYou pick up the radio to answer Harry.\n\n“Sorry, but Leonard can’t come to the phone right now, he currently has his face blown off and his tongue on the floor.”\n“YOU! You fucking cowardly AWOL shit stain! I knew we shouldn’t trust you! Don’t think you’re gonna get away with this! We WILL track you down! And when we do, I will personally blast a hole in your head and skull fuck you! Traitor!”\n“Yeah, yeah, we’ll see.”\n\nYou drop the radio and let Harry continue his meaningless rant. Time for you to move on.\n\nA few days pass and nobody else comes looking for you, just like you expected, no doubt they have better things to worry about than punishing one lone outsider. Your brief stay at the compound served its purpose as far as you’re concerned. It gave you a place to hide when the bombs hit as well as the necessary supplies with which to sustain you. Getting to have sex with Marina was a bonus.\n\nA somewhat self-serving approach, but that attitude will probably serve you well in this new harsh world and it does… for awhile.\n\nThe day of reckoning eventually comes while you were attempting to waylay a traveler who actually wasn’t as alone as she seemed. Your attempt at highway robbery is suddenly cut short in the same brutal way most folks die out in the wasteland; a bunch of bullets to the body.\n",
  "page 284": "As much as you probably regret getting yourself into this mess by EVER returning to the City, you are a leader now and you’re determined to continue to act as such.\n\nSometimes you wonder what would’ve happened had you bought that bomb shelter…\n\nYou stay and demand to be informed on the current situation so you can position the defenses better. You want double security on the borders. You also order that all non-combatants should stay in their homes.\n\nWhen Lisa arrives she has Adonis with her, as well as her own retinue of guards. After telling a couple of your men to take Adonis to your quarters and look after him, you and Lisa begin to talk in your half ruined warehouse.\n\n“We’ve been getting attack from all sides here you know.” You say.\n“So have we, the ex-members that broke off from my Horde have been leading many of these attacks at least as far as the sewers are concerned.”\n“Yeah well we got bigger problems, have you noticed some of the firepower a few of these Glow Children are packing?”\n“Yes, the same type that you used against us five years ago. Some of my people are starting to think that this is some complex ZL plot to wipe us out again, I’ve had to alleviate those concerns though I can’t say it didn’t cross my mind.”\n“Hey, I nearly got wasted by that colossus lying on the floor over there! And as you said your own ex-disgruntled employees are leading a lot of the attacks so don’t think the same thoughts of treachery haven’t gone through our mind up here as well!”\n“Funny that you should think that about us since we don’t have the history of betraying our allies…”\n\nAn argument about accusations breaks out until gunfire from your quarters is heard.\n\n“Adonis!” Lisa says stopping her ranting at you.\n“Oh fuck!” you say and run to the ladder with everyone else not far behind.\n\nWhen you get to your quarters, you see a dead mutant cultist lying on the floor with multiple gunshot wounds, one of your men lies dead with multiple stab wounds and happily Adonis is still alive with one of your guards breathing hard. Adonis immediately runs to Lisa when he sees her.\n\n“Whew! That motherfucker did NOT want to die!” he says.\n\nAfter thanking the soldier profusely, you make a check wondering how the fuck the assassin got in, the only one who ever got through the door before was Lisa and that was because she managed to subdue your guards and had prior knowledge of the place.\n\nAnd that’s when you see a hole in the wall in one of the bedrooms, that hole now leads to the sewers. Knowing damn well that Lisa would make it known that harm should NEVER come to Adonis, any theories that the Shadow Horde is somehow behind things are out of your mind. Lisa’s speculations for you are squashed as well.\n\n“See, the enemy is trying to sew the seeds of mistrust. The old divide and conquer, well to hell with that, they fucked up big time with this clumsy assassination attempt. That’s it we’re mobilizing every fucking thing we got, we’re pooling our resources and…”\n\nYou get another report while in the middle of your speech.\n\n“SIR! THEY’RE ATTACKING DOWNTOWN!” a soldier shouts from the upstairs.\n\n“Fuck!” you exclaim and rush to the scene.\n\nWhen you arrive cultists are throwing home made bombs all over the damn place, some of them are purposely blowing themselves up.\n\n“Aim for the goddamn explosives on their chests before they get close!” you order, while you engage in your own fighting from afar with your rifle. They’re coming like swarms of lemmings though and the body count is growing, monstrosities like the one that tried to kill you earlier are proving cover fire for the gibbering suicide cultists.\n\nYou need to get into a better position to do the maximum amount of damage, so you look for higher ground while Lisa directs from the street level. You enter one of the buildings and begin running up the stairs to get to the roof. In the process of the excitement, you notice something.\n\n“Damn, I used to work in this building.”\n\nAfter this brief thought of the past you make it to the roof, where upon you’re kicked in the face as soon as you exit the door, dropping your rifle.\n\n“Good! I’m glad you avoided the assassins, I was hoping to finish you off myself.”\n\nAs you stand up, you see a nasty looking creature, with a hideous appearance.\n\n\n“You’re going to pay for what you did to me, YOU turned me into this! With your lies and your assault! I was NORMAL until YOU came and ripped me from my protective sanctuary!”\n\nYou immediately know who this is.\n\n“Owen?”\n“Silence! I’m the High Priest! Owen DIED when you threw me into the blasted City! Do you know how much pain and sickness I suffered? How many years I wandered the streets of Zeropolis little more than an intelligent Feral? You realize how long it took me to get over the madness?”\n“Well from where I’m standing I don’t think you’re quite over it.”\n“Oh you’re wrong, quite wrong, when the Savior came, she brought clarity to us all. She will bring true order to this City, not the Horde and not the Legion, but the Children! For the Children ARE the future!”\n“Yeah…and you say you got over the madness?”\n“It doesn’t matter what you think! What matters is you’re going to pay for ALL your lies and treachery tonight! To me AND the Savior! YAAAAGH!”\n\nOwen attacks you, which you narrowly dodge and trip him to the ground, he rolls out of the way and jumps back up.\n\n“Owen, you really want to continue this exercise in futility?”\n\nOwen attacks you again at which point you punch him in the face followed by a kick to his nuts. While he crumples to the ground you retrieve your rifle.\n\n“Alright Owen, you know what happened last time…and trust me I WILL be shooting if you attack again, now what are the defenses of the Savior at the…”\n\nOwen pathetically tries to grab the rifle from you, at which point you blast him in the head splattering his brains and skull all over the roof.\n\n“Idiot.”\n\nYou grab Owen’s corpse and throw it on to the street battle below. His body lands in a bloody broken heap before some of the Glow Children. Upon seeing one of their top leaders dead, this is a great blow to their morale.\n\n“YEAH, THAT’S ONE OF YOUR LEADERS DOWN, NOW GO TELL THE FUCKIN’ SAVIOR SHE’S NEXT!” you shout and begin sniping the ones in retreat.\n\nAfter attempting to mop up the stragglers, the general report is that the Glow Children greatly expended a lot of their manpower in this last attack. It’s odd; it’s almost as if this “Savior” doesn’t really care about controlling the city at all, just destruction.\n\nLisa suggests an attack be made immediately before they can put up a suitable defense, she’s still upset about Adonis nearly being killed, but you’d like to at least regroup and mount an organized attack.\n",
  "page 162": "You like Marina and all, but that’s about all you like about living at the compound. Being by yourself in the wilderness reminds you of how much you missed it. You have no idea what that secret base holds for you, why should you risk your life for a bunch of practical strangers?\n\n“What the hell was I thinking volunteering?” you say out loud.\n\nYou decide to say fuck it, take to the road, and see where it leads you.\n\nA couple days pass and you haven’t encountered anyone, then again you are still pretty far from any kind of civilization, of course you don’t really mind. Suddenly you find out you aren’t alone, when a crack of a rifle shot comes from a nearby hill.\n\n“You fuckin’ idiot, you missed!” a voice shouts.\n“Yeah and you just gave away our fucking position asshole!” another retorts.\n\nYou quickly take cover behind a rock. You recognize those voices though; they’re a couple of the idiots from the compound! The Colonel must’ve had you followed to make sure you stayed on the mission! So much for his so called “faith” in you! (Then again, perhaps he did have a good reason considering you DID go AWOL!)\n\n \nLooks like you’ll have to take care of them before you can truly put the compound behind you.\n\nWhile you’re taking cover, you notice an abandoned gas station nearby; you could make a run for it and take better shelter in there, or return fire.\n",
  "page 283": "It won’t do anyone any good if you’re dead so you decide to follow your guards’ advice and enter your quarters. Should at least be safe down there.\n\nAt least that’s what you think. When you enter your living area, you’re immediately attacked by another hidden assassin! He stabs you several times before you throw him off of you. You weakly pull your pistol and blast the mutant cultist several times, but he absolutely refuses to die!\n\n“FOR THE SAVIOR!” he screams and finishes you off by shoving his knife in your throat, before he dies.\n",
  "page 286": "Lisa’s emotions might be running high, but it does make some sense to attack now. You order a full push to the hospital and not to stop until everyone of the Glow Children are dead along with their Savior.\n\nThe battle to the hospital lasts a couple days mainly because your forces aren’t in a cohesive attack group, you’re getting reinforcements, but it would’ve been more efficient regroup first and come at the GC with some sort of battle plan rather than relentlessly throwing troops into the fray until you break through.\n\nBy the time you get to the hospital, that’s where you meet the last stand of the Glow Children, and it’s also where their battle elite are. The last cybernetically enhanced mutants come out in force and begin mowing down the Alliance troops at an alarming rate, you have order a retreat.\n\nDuring this retreat, one of those giant battle monsters that tried to assassinate you a few days ago targets its weapons on you and mortally wounds you. You lie on the ground and lift your head up long enough to see both of your legs have been blown off and your guts are hanging out. The creature now stomps in your direction ready to finish you off.\n\nYou sure hope Lisa can finish this war by herself, because it’s over for you.\n",
  "page 164": "You return fire, but you don’t do any better. They’re behind rocks just like you are. You and they return fire several times, before something important happens.\n\nThe first one being that you eventually manage to hit one in the head when he popped up again. His buddy immediately ducks down and starts shout expletives at you for killing his friend.\n\nThis first event is followed by a more unfortunate one, while you were shooting at the two spies you saw, you weren’t paying attention to the third one shadowing you. He sneaks behind and shoots you in the back, severing your spine and puncturing a vital organ. You slump onto the rock you were hiding behind hard.\n\nYour assailant then kicks you over, and points his gun directly at you.\n\n“Nobody goes AWOL on the Colonel.” He says before blowing your brains out.\n",
  "page 188": "What’s the point in running? Harry will just eventually send men to the Farmhouse and you’ll probably have to run again. You refuse to run forever, if you’re going to die soon, then you’d rather get it over with.\n\nReinforcements arrive armed with rocket launchers come this time, and with a few volleys, Harry’s men finally breach the walls of Pandora and storm into the place. The fighting is furious as you and your people don’t allow Harry’s troops to gain an inch without heavy losses, but ultimately it comes down to you, Marina, and a few others, holding up in one of the barracks, totally surrounded. As you wince in pain from a bullet wound in your arm you use the radio and give a final transmission to Vivica to prepare for an attack on the Farmhouse soon. Hopefully she has more sense to run when things get bad.\n\n“Damn it, I should’ve ordered a retreat.” You say to yourself having second thoughts during this final hour.\n“No, you shouldn’t have. You stood your ground. I’m glad you did.” Marina says trying to comfort you.\n“I’m not! I’ve gotten us all killed, and I certainly didn’t want that for you.”\n“Its okay, if I’m going to die, at least it’ll be with you.”\n\nMarina kisses you passionately, which makes you briefly forget about the deep shit you’re all in. What the hell, for someone who nearly bought it during the nuclear strike, you had a pretty good run. A lot longer than most in this new hell on Earth.\n\nYou sense that if you don’t come out soon, Harry’s men will probably just start tossing grenades or launching rockets at your position, you’re not going out like that. You look at Marina and everyone else.\n\n“Alright everyone, we’re finishing this. I’ll lead and try to soak up most of the bullets. I wish it wasn’t going to end like this, but shit happens. Ready?”\n\n\nYou get a nod from everyone and then rush out of the door, blasting everything in sight, with Marina and the rest following suit. You feel several bullets hit your body and then a couple to your head before firing one last burst and falling to the ground in a bloody heap.\n",
  "page 192": "“Keep fighting the bastards! Pandora will never fall!” you shout as you mow down another dirt biker.\n\nIn all the fighting though you begin to worry where Marina is, you look around for her in the chaos, and then you see her fighting with multiple enemies converging on her position.\n\nYou rush towards her to back her up and then you’re blown back by an explosion. You slam up against a wall of one of the barracks, other than some minor pain and some scars you’re going to have you aren’t harmed, however your heart is when you see Marina lying bloody on the ground. She isn’t moving. Ignoring everything else you run to her, you kneel down to pick up her body, she grabs weakly on to you, but she’s in bad shape.\n\n“Keep fighting to rebuild civilization…its still worth it…” she says before losing total consciousness.\n\n Alex suddenly comes up to you.\n\n“Hey! We got people firing on us; you need to get the fuck outta the open!”\n“You! You’re a fucking surgeon! You fix her! Save her! Save her NOW!” you shout, picking her up and shoving her into Alex’s arms.\n“Wha…I…” Alex realizes you mean fucking business so he just nods and runs with her to one of the few undamaged buildings.\n\nYou’re blind with rage, you begin charging into battle trying take out as many of these motherfuckers as you can, its quite possible with your actions alone you turned the tide, but you are still just one man, and you nearly get yourself killed, if it hadn’t been for Vivica managing to get a few people from Ashtown to help out, and they arrive just in time.\n\nOphelia shoots a Combine soldier who was sneaking up on you. You turn around to see her, you nearly don’t recognize her decked out in battle gear.\n\n“Told you, you’d see me in the future.” She says and runs off to clean up the stragglers running away.\n\nThe Combine is pulling back. You’ve won, but at a high cost.\n\nWhen you return to check on Marina, you find her dead. Alex explains there was nothing he could do for her. You ask to be alone which he complies. You spend the rest of the night alone with Marina’s lifeless body weeping and vowing revenge.\n\n \nThe next day, you come out with one focus. To assault Fort Justice. This will never be over until Harry is dead. You need to strike now when he’s weak.\n\nA lot of people are wondering if you shouldn’t wait to regroup, but you won’t hear of it, you’re determined to do it now and everyone who’s in fighting condition is coming with you.\n\nIn a couple days you and your small army arrive at Fort Justice. You half expect to die this day assaulting the place, but once again destiny is with you. Fort Justice is experiencing a minor authority problem. You can take the scum out of the wasteland, but you can’t make them disciplined soldiers. The last defeat has shattered morale, and apparently some are starting to question Harry’s orders, while others aren’t willing to die for him. The gate is wide open and parts of the place are in flames.\n\nYou walk in relatively unopposed. Some fighting occurs, but you’re looking for Harry and when the loud mouth shithead sees you, instead of confronting you, he runs for the trapdoor to the underground. You immediately run to cut him off and shoot him in both legs. He falls and grabs for his pistol, but you take careful aim and blow his hand off, he screams in pain when he sees his fingers all over the ground.\n\nA kick to his face follows, and then a stomp, and another, and another. You don’t stop until his face looks like tenderized hamburger. He tries to act defiant by trying to give you the finger with his good hand, but you take it and break the motherfucker along with the rest of his hand.\n\n“This is for Marina and the rest of the deaths you caused.” You say, before blasting his mushy bloody head into mushy bloody pieces.\n\nNow its over.\n\nYou collapse by Harry’s body, spent and drained. Alex goes over to see if you’re alright, but Ophelia tells him to just make sure all the enemy are either dead or running. Ophelia takes you to a barrack and puts you on a bed and tells you to rest, which you do.\n\n“I did it Marina…I got him…” you mumble while falling asleep.\n\nThe next few weeks consist of rebuilding. Rebuilding everything. Fort Justice. Base Pandora. All the damage Harry caused. Word gets out to the Combine occupied towns about their current situation, with no centralized authority figure anymore, the Combine dissipates as wasteland scum flee and return to the outlands where they belong. The townspeople of those places are very grateful for your help, and you’re now in charge of everything but you take no joy in any of it, or anything. You’re numb. You go through the motions, but you’re basically in a daze. All your thoughts are of Marina, you feel empty without her.\n\nIf it wasn’t for her, you wouldn’t even be alive right now. You would’ve died in a big mushroom cloud death. You start blaming yourself for not being able to save her, you start thinking about suicide. Everyone gets a little worried about you. Vivica starts radioing in wondering about your condition, Alex (Who’s quite familiar with mental breakdowns) attempts to talk to you, but it’s Ophelia who turns you around, though not immediately, but it’s her actions that become the turning point.\n\nLate one night, as you wallow in the emptiness, Ophelia visits you. You expect her to tell you not blame yourself for Marina’s death again, but she doesn’t. Instead she talks about the time when you saved her from the cultists and how grateful she was that day and how she would’ve almost done anything to repay you for saving her life.\n\n“Mm…well you repaid it already. You saved mine back at Pandora.” You say wishing to be left alone.\n“No, I’m saving it now.”\n\nOphelia begins to remove her clothing, something that takes you completely by surprise. You feel you shouldn’t, you know you shouldn’t, but maybe it’s feeling of loneliness, maybe it’s the feeling of confusion, or maybe its just plain hormones, and you give in to Ophelia’s advances. And for that one night, the emptiness within you disappears.\n\nThe next day Ophelia is gone leaving you a note saying she’s going back to Ashtown and tells you that you shouldn’t give up on life since you have so much more to change in this new world.\n\nWhen you think about it, Marina saved you, so you could carry that goal out. She always did see the potential in you to do great things.\n\nWith this new perspective, you begin to return to normal, though there still was a little piece of you that died when Marina did. You’ll never completely be the same. Life goes on though.\n\nFive more years pass…\n\nIt’s been ten years since the bombs dropped and civilization is starting to rebuild itself again…well somewhat.\n\nHard to believe you would’ve become any type of leader trying to rebuild civilization. Marina might not be around anymore, but obviously her influence on you still is and always will be as you follow her dream of rebuilding civilization again.\n\nYou’re still running things from Base Pandora, which is now the unofficial head of the Atomic Alliance. The towns formally under Combine occupation are included, but are now treated as equals rather than glorified labor camps, though getting everyone to agree completely on anything still remains a problem. Fort Justice is now under Vivica’s command and the Farmhouse, now known as Eden is a fully functional agricultural community. (It supplies food as well as biofuel for vehicles now) After that one night with Ophelia you don’t see her anymore, but last you heard she had a baby and got married to someone in Ashtown. Good for her.\n\nOther than political disagreements, everything has been going fairly well; raiders are still a problem, but much less than in the past. For the most part people are pretty happy living in your territory.\n\nOne thing that’s been debated among you and some of other leaders, are the few GZS Shelters the Alliance has stumbled across over recent years. No effort has been made to open them, but they’re all sealed shut by their main computers. From what you know by reading some of the GZS documents found in Base Pandora (and Alex who definitely has some knowledge of GZS protocols) the Shelters weren’t supposed to open up until the central computer determined that sufficient amount of time had passed and the surface deemed safe. Apparently the computers still think the surface sucks. (And that assessment wouldn’t exactly be wrong)\n\nMost of the other Alliance leaders say that some sort of contact should be made with them. You get the impression some of them might’ve done it anyway, it’s just you have most of the equipment that makes it a lot easier.\n",
  "page 191": "“Fall back to the farm house!” you shout as you mow down another dirt biker.\n\nAs your people begin to escape you look around for Marina in the chaos, and then you see her fighting multiple enemies converging on her position while she attempts to retreat.\n\nYou rush towards her to back her up and then you’re blown back by an explosion. You slam up against a wall of one of the barracks, other than some minor pain and some scars you’re going to have you aren’t harmed, however your heart is when you see Marina lying bloody on the ground. She isn’t moving. Ignoring everything else you run to her, you kneel down to pick up her body, she grabs weakly on to you, but she’s in bad shape.\n\nAlex then grabs you by the shoulder\n\n“Hey! We got people firing on us; and in case you didn’t notice you told everyone to fall back!\n“You! You’re a fucking surgeon! You fix her! Save her! Save her NOW!” you shout, picking her up and shoving her into Alex’s arms.\n“Wha…I…” Alex realizes you mean fucking business so he takes her, but asks about you since he notices you’re grabbing another nearby gun.\n“What’re you doing? You gotta get outta here! You can’t fight all of them!”\n“GO! I’m giving you fucking time!” you order Alex pushing him away and charge into battle firing two weapons in hand.\n\nYou kill a lot of them, but you’re outnumbered and outgunned at this point. You eventually fall to a hail of bullets and die. Marina follows you soon afterwards on the retreat back to the farmhouse.\n",
  "page 194": "At one time you thought about actually buying one of those things, sometimes you even wonder how things would’ve been living underground completely oblivious to what’s going on the surface. Things might’ve been a lot easier…or maybe they wouldn’t. You’ll just have to wonder about the road not traveled.\n\nYou see no harm in making contact; they may even have useful resources to trade and might appreciate knowing that the surface is exactly the hell on Earth that they might think. Plus the rest of the Alliance leaders seem pleased that you’re agreeing with them. Maintaining good relations to keep everyone happy is always a sure way of keeping the Alliance stable. Even Ashtown makes mention of a Shelter nearby that they’ve been debating about whether to contact or not. You organize how to go about this, since you don’t want to make enemies unnecessarily.\n\n\nIt doesn’t take long to open up the Shelters and bypass the computer elevator systems with your help. First contact with most of the shelters is a very large surprise for its inhabitants, though a lot of them seem really grateful. Apparently GZS Shelters weren’t built very well, you hear reports of how inhabitants had to improvise and constantly repair various things. Alex tells you he isn’t surprised.\n\n“The main reason why I outlived my cyborgs when I was…uh…indisposed… was due to having faulty GZS equipment. Granted they made a lot of good stuff, but they had a terrible habit of cutting corners. When I think about it, I really can’t believe I thought I was actually going to DO something with them, probably wouldn’t have even lasted in a real fight…still it would’ve been interesting…my God I can’t believe I used to think things like this…like…I dunno…”\n\nEvery now and then Alex talks like that. Probably wondering about his own road not traveled. It creeps people out though, however it doesn’t prevent him from being a good doctor. You almost get the impression he feels like by being a good doctor and patching folks up real well is sort of like his “penance”. One he feels necessary to do until the day he dies. This line of thinking becomes really noticeable within a few weeks of the Shelter openings.\n\nThe Shelter near Ashtown is in bad shape. From the reports you’ve heard some sort of weird “social experiment” was going on down there which resulted in some sort of catastrophe. There are many dead bodies and broken equipment. Many of the people are sick and infected with something, and they aren’t in very good shape to go anywhere. Looks like they’ve been slowly dying. In fact the Mayor of Ashtown, Carlos, is taking the hard line stance refusing to let the ones that went down there to come back up, for fear that they will infect his town. This isn’t a popular decision, so he’s hoping you can send some sort of medical team to help since Ashtown doesn’t have the experts you do. Carlos says that he’ll formally join the Atomic Alliance if you get him out of this jam. Alex insists on going to help.\n\n“Please, let me go help. I’m the best doctor in the Alliance. I…I need to do this. I need to help these people…” Alex says almost in a begging fashion.\n“…Well alright Alex, but you’re taking one of those biohazard suits! Who knows what the hell those people have, and I really can’t risk losing my best doctor.”\n\nAlex thanks you profusely, and gathers a couple of his assistants and all the necessary equipment before leaving.\n\nA couple weeks pass and you get a report from Carlos. He mentions that Alex has determined there is nothing contagious about whatever the Shelter people are infected with, and the Ashtown citizens are allowed to come back up and return. Alex is still working on the problem though and it might take awhile, he requests for more equipment, which you allow Ashtown formally joins the Alliance. You personally go there to welcome them in.\n\nIt’s strange that you’ve never actually been to Ashtown before, given a lot of your dealings with it. While you’re here on business you think about Ophelia, and that one night. A night that possibly saved you from committing suicide, given the downward spiral you were in at the time. There’s a few times you thought about going to see her to thank her…but then you think how she has a family now and it would just be too weird.\n\nA month passes and you suddenly get a call from Alex on your radio.\n\n“Alex? Where are you?”\n“I’m in the Shelter. I managed to rig the computer to transmit a signal! Now I can talk to you directly! Great huh?”\n“Uh yeah…what’s going on over there?”\n“Oh, nothing much. This place is pretty fascinating; I’ve been trying to figure out what was going on down here. This one diary was really interesting”\n“Alex what about the people?”\n“It seems there was this guy called Elliot who had a lot of weird ideas, he was a doctor…” Alex says seemingly oblivious to your question.\n“Yeah, I know the type. ALEX WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKIN’ PEOPLE?”\n“Oh yeah…the people. They’re okay…I guess.”\n“You guess? What the fuck Alex, don’t you know?”\n“Well, uh y’know... this isn’t an exact science, and I’m still trying to figure some things out…I went to Ashtown recently for some more supplies, but I think I need some more higher qulity equipment from you, its getting kind of complicated down here…”\n“What the fuck Alex? No, you’re not getting anything else! We’re not an endless supply of resources! Now you work with what you got and I better hear some progress soon!”\n“…work with what I got…yeah…story of my life…” Alex says and disconnects.\n\nAnother week passes and this time you get a message from Carlos, he doesn’t sound well, but he does sound angry.\n\n“…we ally with you and this is (Cough) what happens? We’re all sick and it’s (Cough!) all you and that doctor’s fault! He contaminated us! YOU contaminated us! The town is Uhhh…”\n\nThere’s an old saying, that a scorpion, no matter how well you take care of it or treat it, its nature will always be to sting you. And that’s just what happened.\n\nShit.\n",
  "page 195": "You remember something the Colonel said years ago “They made their bed now they can sleep in it.” You see no reason to disturb the Shelters; you have enough to do with surface matters.\n\nYour unwillingness to contact them though is frowned upon by the other alliance leaders. Some are even calling you “inhumane” for leaving them down there. You take great offense to this since you’re anything but inhumane; you just don’t see the need to contact a bunch of people who wanted to be shut off from society for a long period of time in the first place. Besides who says they want to be contacted? Who know how they’ll act? Seems like it’s just going to open up trouble you don’t really need.\n\nIt doesn’t matter though, the other town leaders are determined to go through with it, and you can’t stop them, it’s not like you’re running a dictatorship here. You are however denying all help from your end. Base Pandora, Fort Justice, and Eden are not to be involved. The Alliance relationship becomes a bit strained.\n\nA few weeks pass and you get a report from the Alliance towns, the first Shelter openings didn’t go very peacefully. Due to their fumbling and having no plan other than “Opening them up.” They manage to get into misunderstandings and a few fights occurred resulting in some deaths on both sides, but mostly on the Shelter people side, seeing as they haven’t been hardened by the surface. Ultimately they pull everyone out the Shelters kicking and screaming. Some Alliance citizens don’t like the fact that their local governments have engaged in these kinds of tactics, and you’re wondering what the hell they think they’re doing, since you said it was a bad idea in the first place and this just proves it.\n\nYou later find out that one of the pettier leaders convinced most of the others that the Shelters contained resources that would make them less dependant on you (Such as operating filtrated water recycling systems) and decided taking the Shelters by force would be a good idea since if you were unwilling to help before you might be unwilling to help in the future.\n\nOf course that was just idiotic logic on their part since you were just against the idea of fucking around with the Shelters; you weren’t on some power trip.\n\nWithin the next few weeks reports start coming in about riots in the towns and mistreatment of the relocated Shelter people. It’s the Combine all over again…\n\nYou send in troops on your end to try to maintain some sort of peace, AND to stop all this unnecessary cruelty to the Shelter folks who were just peacefully living out their existence until some Alliance assholes pulled them from their homes.\n\nNaturally being a peacemaker is a thankless job. The “doves” think you’re being a fascist by using force to stop the rioting and protests, and then by the same token the “hawks” think you’re meddling in business that isn’t your concern since you didn’t want anything to do with the Shelters in the first place and shouldn’t be telling them what to do with the Shelters OR its people. Now you start to get angry.\n\n“Motherfuckers I RUN the goddamn Alliance! I fuckin’ built it! I’ll say what the fuck goes!”\n\nThat’s the last transmission you make to the Alliance as a single entity. The next day it becomes a much smaller entity as the Alliance town leaders official break off from you and declare themselves independent and calling themselves the Atomic Confederation.\n\nYou’re so pissed of by all of this that you don’t even WANT to bring them back into the “fold”. You’re ready to wash your hands of this exercise in stupidity. You withdraw all peacekeeping troops and instead of wasting more resources and man power on a long drawn out war taking town after town that will only weaken you, you decide to take a more strategic approach and attack the Shelters themselves. You send a strike team to locate each one that’s been opened up and blow up the water recyclers, and then to blow up the elevators allowing access to the Shelters in the first place. You also of course aren’t going to be trading food supplies from Eden anymore.\n\n“So much for your new resources. See how long you last without our help, fucktards.” Is your last transmission to the Atomic Confederation.\n\nThe Atomic Confederation doesn’t last very long, it collapses mainly due to the inept and corrupt government, civil unrest, and even outside attack from raiders who are always attracted to chaos. By the time its all over the towns are little more than criminal havens that fight amongst each other.\n\nYou’re still in good shape though; however this event has caused a trend in isolationism. The Atomic Alliance doesn’t expand past its now severely shortened borders. You still have dealings with Ashtown every now and then, but after they heard all the problems that were going on, it appears they become a bit isolationist as well (Which does have the benefit that they don’t try to open the Shelter that they located nearby, thankfully someone learned the lesson to leave well enough alone.) and you even have less contact with them as well.\n\nYou live out the rest of your years running the Atomic Alliance which mainly consists of protecting your borders. Your death comes suddenly when Alex unexpectedly assassinates you. (Theories point to simple revenge for all those years ago and just his underlying unstableness) You’re buried next to Marina, he’s immediately executed and Vivica takes over.\n\nThe Alliance continues under her leadership, but after her, leaders become less capable as leaders are apt to do in government systems. Eventually like the Combine, and the Atomic Confederation, the Atomic Alliance collapses completely thus ending the attempt to rebuilding civilization in this part of the wasteland.\n",
  "page 198": "You immediately dispatch another team of medics in hazmat suits to Ashtown. Vivica insists on going since she’s probably the second best doctor in the Alliance, you order her not to since you can’t afford to lose her as well, not to mention she runs Fort Justice, but she’s defiant and goes anyway. You also order Eden to not let ANYONE who wasn’t already working there in, until this situation is resolved. You can’t afford your major food source to get contaminated. You decide not to inform the rest of the Alliance towns, since you hope maybe you can contain this before panic occurs. You next step is to radio Alex, but as predicted you don’t get an answer.\n\nYou soon get a report from Vivica,\n\n\n“It looks bad. REAL Bad. Most of Ashtown is already dead or dying. Whatever it is, I don’t think it’s airborne. It might be the water supply. The only weird thing is, the children didn’t seem to be affected…it’s very sad though. We’re going to have a bunch of orphans.”\n“Can’t you do ANYTHING?”\n“No, I have no idea what this is and I think it’s too late anyway, uh there’s something else I think you’ll want to know…though I’m not sure how to say this…”\n“Vivica just spit it the fuck out!”\n“Well, uh…I tired to treat Ophelia, but I failed, her husband was already dead by the time I got here.”\n“…Vivica, I appreciate you trying to save someone I had fond memories of, but there’s a whole town at stake…”\n“I know, I know, but that’s not what I’m getting at. Ophelia had a daughter you know. Her name’s Laura. She’s five. Ophelia told me before she died; she wanted her daughter to have a good home.”\n“Well of course! I mean we’ll give good homes to all the orphans!”\n“Again, that’s not it. She asked for you specifically to give her that home. She said she said it’s about time her daughter got to know her father anyway.”\n\nThe surprises just keep coming.\n\n“Excuse me?”\n“Looks like you’re this little girl’s father…the timing is about right, I mean you did have that encounter with her five years ago. She’s five and if I may say, I see the family resemblance, she doesn’t look anything like Ophelia’s husband, I mean granted he’s dead right now, but…”\n“Why the hell didn’t she tell me? I mean I would’ve…”\n“I asked the same question, during her final moments. She’s said she was sorry she never told you before, but she knew you had other things on your mind and bigger concerns with rebuilding civilization and all. She always thought she would’ve lived in Marina’s shadow anyway and by keeping Laura to herself it was like she still had a piece of you…sir I hate to break this information up since I know it probably really important to you, but what are we going to do about the town and Alex and everything?”\n“Start evacuating the children to Base Pandora, the town is dead. I’ll take care of Alex.” You say grimly before disconnecting.\n\nArmed and focused, for the first time in a long time you travel by yourself to the Shelter where Alex is at. You meet up with Vivica on the way, who tries to advise you to at least go in with back up, but you won’t hear of it and tell her to continue on to Base Pandora. You also see Laura and some of the other orphaned children. They’re obviously still upset about their parents dying horrible deaths. You approach Laura whose eyes are all red from crying. She looks up at you.\n\n“Are…are you really my daddy?” she asks, obviously having been informed of the situation. Contrary to what Vivica said, you think she looks more like her mother, but yes there is a resemblance to you particularly the hair. Unsure of how to respond, you give a straight forward answer.\n\n“Yes I am and I’ll be home soon to take care of you.” you stroke her face and get back in your vehicle and drive off.\n\nYou drive through Ashtown and see the dead bodies, by the facial expressions you get the impression it wasn’t a pleasant one. Once again you think about going to see Ophelia’s body, but you quickly decide against it. You’d rather remember her how she was the last time you saw her. Besides you’ll always see her now in your daughter, plus you’ve got a score to settle with Alex.\n\nYou get to the Shelter and enter its foyer and surprisingly its elevator is at the top, looks like some modifications have been made to it as it looks as if the call buttons were there originally. You really don’t care about any of it though, you’re on a mission.\n\nWhen you get to the bottom, you see the same modified call buttons near the elevator on this level as well (You can’t believe the idiotic way GZS designs their Shelters though, effectively trapping their “customers” down here) You also see more dead bodies in various stages of decay, some look like they were dead long before Alex got here. Much of the equipment and place in general is in disarray, but you also notice some of it has been recently repaired. Probably by Alex no doubt.\n\nYou hear cursing coming from a nearby room, it sounds like Alex.\n",
  "page 197": "You’ve got to keep this quiet and you’ve got to keep whatever this is from spreading. You quietly call the most loyal and capable soldiers under your command to meet you immediately. You explain to them what needs to be done. Any still living Ashtown inhabitants must be killed, and the entire town burned to the ground. Alex must also be killed and the Shelter rendered inaccessible forever. You tell them to keep you informed at all times.\n\nThe strike team is sent in the middle of the night in Hazmat suits and tons of hardware. Everyone in Base Pandora wonders what’s going on, but due to the more military mindset here, people know not to ask too many questions.\n\nEventually you get a message from one of your soliders.\n\n“Uh sir, it looks like most of the town is dead already, I don’t think it’s airborne, because it doesn’t look like the children were affected…”\n“Are you sure about that? Just because they look sick doesn’t mean they aren’t. They could be carrying.”\n“Sir?”\n“…I said kill everything Sergeant…”\n“But I think…”\n“DON’T THINK! JUST DO IT!”\n\n\nThe Sergeant disconnects and you can only imagine what happened next, but you don’t really want to. A little while later you get another report. It’s the Sergeant again, he sounds very hollow.\n\n“Sir…it’s uh over. Alex is dead…he didn’t even put up a fight…we’re putting the explosives in Shelter entrance as I speak…should implode and bury the Shelter from being accessible…”\n“Very good. You’ve done a necessary thing Sergeant.”\n“…no I haven’t…goodbye…”\n\nYou hear a gunshot on the other end followed by a bunch of other voices shouting and dead air. Your official report to the Atomic Alliance (Because it’s not like you can completely cover this up) is that a ruthless gang of raiders completely destroyed Ashtown as well as the Shelter and that you’re sending squads to go hunt them down.\n\nThis isn’t really a satisfactory answer, but given how far away Ashtown is from the rest of the Alliance towns nobody really questions it. At least not initially.\n\nOver the past few months you’re noticeably distracted, and can’t concentrate on anything. You’re constantly thinking someone’s going to investigate, or one of those you sent on the mission is going to blab (Now you wish they all blew their brains out) your behavior starts becoming a bit erratic as you give out strange orders to cover up things you think are going to lead to your exposure. You constantly rationalize your orders as attempting to keep the Alliance from falling, since you’re convinced that everyone knew what Alex did, you’d be blamed for incompetence for allowing it to happen and without you running things you just know the Alliance wouldn’t survive.\n\nHowever something like this couldn’t be covered up forever. Eventually someone gets suspicious of your behavior which leads to rumors, which then in turn leads to investigating. Eventually the truth comes out. The Alliance citizens are appalled, in fact if you hadn’t proceeded with your extreme plan and just come out with the truth about Alex’s actions in the beginning you might not have been hated quite so much.\n\nYou displayed poor judgment, by allowing Alex to go about his own devices. Strike one.\n\nYou ruthlessly had children killed to possibly contain a contagion. Strike two.\n\nYou attempted to cover all this up and lied about it. Strike three.\n\nThis type of behavior makes you look like deceitful murderous tyrant, something the Alliance towns had enough of under Harry during the Combine regime. People are calling for your blood, and your immediate resignation of Atomic Alliance leader, in fact you might be imprisoned…or worse. You’ve lost all support.\n\nBy the end, you’ve barricaded yourself in an underground room in Base Pandora with people telling you to give yourself up; of course you have no intention of doing that.\n\nIn your last moments as you point the pistol to your head, you think about Marina, and how it all would\u0027ve been easier had you died with her and how you tried to rebuild civilization even after she was gone, but just failed without her around, however once again you rationalize.\n\n“Yeah…they all united against me…I kept them united… then Vivica will certainly take power…the Alliance will live on…I didn’t fail…Marina…I didn’t fail…”\n\nYour delusional thoughts come to an end with a door burst open, and a bullet to the brain.\n",
  "page 178": "Secession isn’t really a viable option. You simply can’t stand up to the resources Harry has, the only option is to distance yourself as far away as possible. Harry’s escorts will be here in a few days so you start packing immediately. Marina wonders what you’re doing.\n\n“We’re getting the hell outta here! You think Harry’s gonna let me live? At best he might be sending me into missions into the city! Fuck that!”\n“You mean we’re just leaving? We’re not fighting back?”\n“What you think I like this? I mean I don’t want to leave, but if we stay, we’re gonna end up dead! Come on pack your shit.”\n“I dunno. I can’t just leave everything. I mean I’m still friends and close to all these people, I can’t just leave them.”\n“Look, I’ve actually gotten along with most of the folks here too, but I’m not sticking my neck out for any of them. Besides, if they’re smart they’ll leave too.”\n“I can’t do it, I can’t go.”\n\nYou stop packing.\n\n“What, are you fucking kidding me?”\n“No, I mean I can’t do it. This is my life, this was my life before the bombs and it’ll continue to be my life afterwards. I can’t just leave, I mean we’re trying to re-build society…”\n“Fuck society! Why can’t it just be me and you?”\n\nMarina suddenly tells you a revelation you always had an inkling of, but never quite sure until today…\n\n“You know why I liked you in the beginning? Because all those years we worked in that office I saw a man who worked hard in a mundane job yet had the potential to be something more under the right circumstances. I’m sure you remember I said something similar five years ago when I convinced you to come with me. Then you proved me right somewhat by volunteering and taking charge of this place. I knew I’d chosen right. I was in love with you.”\n“Was eh?”\n“Yes, was. In the following years of you taking command of this place you’ve shown no more initiative. You’ve been content to just do the mundane routine of running this place. You were doing exactly the opposite of what I first saw. You were squandering your potential.”\n“So what was I supposed to be doing then Marina? Driving across the fuckin’ wasteland shooting up people, taking their shit, and declaring their town part of the Combine like Harry?”\n“No, of course not. But you could’ve done something more. Like sending out your own exploration teams, or even going on them yourself. Maybe if you had, you wouldn’t be in this position now. You’d have better leverage to face Harry. Maybe he is a fucking dictator, but he’s accomplishing a goal.”\n\nYou pack the last of your things and start walking while Marina follows you.\n\n“Yeah, some goal…Okay you know what Marina, fuck it. I gotta get outta here, and its apparent you’ve made your decision and I’m not gonna try to talk you out of it, because if you’re that willing to throw fuckin’ five years away just because I’m not the wasteland warrior that you dreamed up in your mind, then like I said fuck it. You’re not worth my time either anymore. I hope you and Harry have a nice life, I’m sure he’s exactly what you’re looking for. Hope for your sake though his obsession for you is a lot stronger than his vindictiveness.”\n“Fuck you! It’s not that goddamn black and white! I don’t like fuckin Harry, and I never will, but…HEY! Don’t fuckin’ walk out on me!”\n\nYou storm out of the base, and Marina attempts to reason and explain, but it’s all bullshit to you. This whole thing was. Trying to “rebuild” society, yeah right. As if there was anything worth rebuilding in the first place. You’re done with this shit. You tried it and it was okay for awhile, but now its time to move on. Away from this and away from people.\n\nYou travel for a few days, and you expect Harry’s men to come tracking you, but nobody ever follows you. You get attacked by a few mutated wolves, and a few mad men here and there, but nobody from the Combine. It’s possible that you’ve done a good job of throwing them off, and Harry’s people aren’t skilled trackers, of course maybe Harry’s just glad you’re out of the way period. You briefly have an amusing thought, that Marina still had some sort of feelings for you and offered to be Harry’s girl in exchange of letting you live.\n\nYou decide to think that’s what happened, since you’ll never know for certain and you’ve always been prone to imagine dramatic movie like endings.\n\n“Heh. We’ll always have Pandora.” You laugh to yourself as you distance yourself further away from Combine territory.\n",
  "page 177": "Well there’s nothing stopping you from sending your own exploration detachment teams, there’s nothing stopping you from going yourself either. As far as you know, nobody from the Compound has bothered scouting past Base Pandora, you figure it’s as good of place as any…\n\n“Okay I want two scouting detachments of four. I’m going with one of them. We’re just going to go a few miles from this place and then come back. It’ll give us a better lay of the land in case of an attack and it’ll keep our skills sharp as well. The rest of you guard the base as usual.”\n\nYou half expect Marina to come with you, but she’s content on staying behind to help look after the base. She looks at you admiringly though that you’re taking the initiative. She tells you she loves you and that she can’t wait for you to get back. You like the fact she’s got confidence that you ARE coming back this time around.\n\nYou and your team leave and start exploring. Base Pandora really was in a secluded location, most of your trek is through a small unspoiled woods, eventually you get to the end though after about a day. You notice the Geiger counter is clicking a bit more. Not a lot, but enough to be a little unsettling. Using some binoculars, up ahead you see a single run down farm house (the farm itself also looks run down and hasn’t been up kept in years). Just then you see a few vehicles also approaching up ahead, you tell everyone else to pull back into the woods and keep down while you do likewise. You continue to look as the vehicle park nearby the farm house and figures begin to get out. All of them are wearing robes and carrying automatic weapons over their backs. You also see them dragging what looks to be a few hapless prisoners with them as they enter the structure. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that these folks aren’t the nice type.\n\n“Oh shit, these guys look prepared. Who do you think they are?” one of your team asks.\n“How should I know Reggie? When we moved into Base Pandora it’s not like we got a welcome to the neighborhood letter from every nearby freak within a few miles of us. If I had to guess and judging by the robes, they’re probably some doomsday cult. Probably one that was building up a stock pile of shit even before the bombs hit. Got some interesting vehicles though.”\n“So, what’re we going to do?”\n\nWhat to do indeed. You definitely need to wipe these cultists out since it’s possible you could have trouble with them in the future if they start wandering in your direction. They also have vehicles that could be of use and probably other supplies as well. You could radio in and wait for reinforcements, but the prisoners you just saw them take in might be dead by then.\n",
  "page 179": "\"Fuck off Harry, and take your Combine and shove it up your ass. We’re seceding.” You abruptly tell him over the radio, before announcing your intensions to everyone else in the base.\n\nYou get a mixed reaction of apprehension, while a lot of them aren’t too fond of Harry, they still like living with basic necessities, something that becomes apparent in the weeks to come. There are a number of problems from the beginning.\n\nFirst of all, you’re an isolated community and while that has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks, meaning the instant you tell Harry to fuck off and die over the radio, you’re no longer getting any supplies of any kind, you’re stuck with what you have. Medical supplies are scarce as it is; now they’re non-existent. Forget about getting new ammo too.\n\nFood is a bit of a problem, (Water isn’t, the base has its own water recycling and filtering system, fortunately it’s on the surface rather than underground) since you were getting a majority of that from Fort Justice. Some hunting is done in the surrounding wilderness. It becomes a major problem though when Harry sends an invasion detachment and cuts you off from even doing that. It’s not even like you can start farming even if you had the means since the inside of the base is completely paved (as well as harboring a deranged doctor and his cyborgs)\n\nThe only thing that prevents him from completely taking the place is the fact he’s spread a bit thin in other areas of the Combine with keeping control of other towns and you’re pretty well fortified. Doesn’t mean he can’t continue to harass you, and he can keep supplying his people. You can’t. His people are somewhat more battle hardened as well. Not that you’re saddled with a bunch of non-combatants, but anyone that’s still following Harry willingly has been indoctrinated with a little more fanatic conformity, which is a great thing to have in a soldier. So great, you wish you had more people like that.\n\nA couple months after the initial siege; most people are ready to throw you to Harry’s men in exchange for mercy. Marina and few others stand by you, but its mob rule. You’re overwhelmed, disarmed and thrown to the invasion force outside.\n\nAll that still stayed loyal to you are immediately shot as traitors. The ones that turned on you are merely beaten (and a few of them shot to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again)\n\nYou and Marina are taken back to Harry. He gets a sadistic pleasure out of having you beaten in front of Marina. He attempts to give Marina one last chance to submit, but she refuses causing him to slap her upside the face and then start to rip off her clothes. You yell out, but are promptly beaten by Harry’s guards again. Unfortunately for all his bravado Harry’s unable to get it up. He tries like hell since he wants you to watch, but for whatever reason, his attempt at rape is a complete failure. Knowing the end is near anyway, Marina laughs at him before he smashes her skull against the ground yelling and screaming at her whole time.\n\nHe then kicks your bloody body and blames you for having to do that, you spit out a gob of blood and some teeth.\n\n\n“Enjoy your fuckin’ empire, you limp dick bitch.” You groan.\n“FUCK YOU, YOU GODDAMN PIECE OF SHIT!” he replies back, grabbing his pistol off the table.\n\n Harry then ends your existence by emptying his gun into you.\n",
  "page 183": "No time like the present, besides, if you’re careful you should be able to take them.\n\nYou and your team briskly run through the field while keeping your head down. All is going well until you hear a shot ring out from the house, and one of your team members makes a stifled yelp. You turn around and see Reggie, clutching his throat and bleeding profusely from it. While you’re all standing around watching him convulse, another shot rings out. This one clips Vivica in the head splattering her brains on to your clothing.\n\n“RUN!” you shout, not wanting to be the sniper’s next target. There are multiple shots now, and one by one you see your team member’s go down, until the last one is you when you feel a bullet severing your spine. You’re fucked.\n\nAs you lay the field still trying to crawl away, you hear the cultists coming for you, you do the only thing you can and turn over in order to aim at them in an effort to at least take a few out. You manage to kill about three over zealous ones advancing on your position until you hear one shouting for the snipers in the house to finish you off since you’re not worth it.\n\nA single bullet enters your eye, ending it once and for all. You body is then taken along with your teams’ to serve as food and bizarre rituals.\n",
  "page 182": "It’s a brutal world and it just got more so. Rushing in outnumbered, isn’t likely to save anyone and most likely going to get you killed. You radio in for reinforcements and keep an eye on the farm in the mean time. Later when the darkness comes you see a group of them come out with torches, form a circle in a nearby plain and begin chanting. You count ten of them altogether Soon two more come out with one of the prisoners from earlier. She’s bound, gagged and naked; you know what’s going to come next.\n\nReggie and another one in your team wants to do something, but you insist that they do nothing and to keep quiet. It’s all over soon anyway, as you see them sacrifice the poor girl for whatever outlandish beliefs they hold. You take first watch for the night. The next day your reinforcements arrive…both of them.\n\n“What the fuck? I asked for at least five more people!”\n“Sorry, but that other recon group you sent also ran into trouble, in fact two of them are already dead, and we had to send a rescue team to fetch the other two since one has a broken leg.”\n“Oh that’s wonderful.”\n“So should we call this off?” one of you team asks.\n“No Vivica, we’re going through with it, but we’re going to employ some stealth, they had three prisoners, I get the feeling they’ll be doing the same ceremony they did last night.”\n“Are we going to attack them now then?”\n“No Leonard, I don’t feel like fighting a bunch of fanatics armed with machine guns in an open plain with no cover. And we can’t just start firing on them from here, we need to wipe them ALL out as quickly as possible without them having a chance the regroup, fortify or any of that shit. We’re gonna sneak into the house and ambush the whole fuckin’ cult while they’re doing their little ceremony.”\n\nYou wait until night and sure enough they all come out like you thought, then come the others with the prisoner. That’s when the six of you quickly sneak through an overgrown field towards the house. You get to the stairs when Reggie and Leonard break off towards the area were the cult is performing their ceremony.\n\n“I can’t just let them kill another! We can take ‘em now! They’re off guard!”\n“Reggie get the fuck…shit!”\n\nReggie and Leonard begin firing, the fucking idiots aren’t even taking cover, they’re going head long in like they’re stupid ass action heroes. You and the others lay down some cover fire, but it’s not enough. Reggie and Leonard are cut down after killing a whopping ONE cultist and not even saving the hapless girl, who’s shot instantly. The cultists start spreading out, moving forward, and circling around you at the same time, they’re also better shots than you too, as they’re carefully aiming rather than just firing in the general vicinity. After seeing another one of your team members go down, you and the rest fall back into the house itself.\n\nThe inside of the house looks like something out of a horror movie, there are skulls and bones littering it, along with it blood stains everywhere.\n\n“Holy shit! What’ve we gotten ourselves into?” Vivica yells.\n“Shut the fuck up, I hear something…like crying…it’s downstairs.”\n“What about the cultists?”\n“Well it’s the same plan, they just know about us now, let’s hope we can still get ‘em in a good ambush.”\n\nYou and your team members spread out in the house, you head down into the basement, which looks more like a small temple layout. You see a young woman in a cage, and when she sees you her eyes fill with hope. You hear the cultists stomping around upstairs and some gunfire, at which point you try to find a good place to hide.\n\nA bunch of footsteps run down the stairs, you wait in anticipation…closer…closer…\n\n\nNOW!\n\nYou pop up from your spot and begin firing, you kill six of them before they can even react, and the remaining two barely get off some wild shots before you splatter them as well. Still breathing heavy among the dead, you finally hear some good news.\n\n“Hey! Are you still alive down there?” Vivica shouts.\n“Yeah! What’s going on up there?”\n“We got a few of them, but I think most of them converged on your position though.”\n“Of course they did, I’ve always been popular.” You reply.\n\nYou release the girl in the cage who’s very thankful. She mentions her name is Ophelia and she’s from a place called Ashtown which is far from this place. She says the cultists came storming into her town specifically trying to capture young girls; they took three before they finally were driven away, and unfortunately Ophelia was one of the three. You tell Ophelia your story; she seems to think you’ve got the right idea about going about things.\n\n“I think I’m going to tell my people back in Ashtown that we need to start getting better organized as well, and I’ll be sure to tell them all about you and how you rescued me! Maybe we’ll see each other in the future.”\n\nYou and your team search the farm house which just like you thought was stocked with all sorts of goodies. You’re going to have haul some of it back, but you decide that you could also establish another base of sorts here after it was cleaned up. You’d also like to establish more of a relationship with this Ashtown. So you allow Ophelia to take one of the vehicles for her to drive back there, she certainly doesn’t have a problem with that!\n\nBefore heading back you put Vivica in charge of the place and tell her you’ll be sending some more folks to help get this farm up and running. Not bad for a first try.\n\nFour more years pass…\n\nIt’s been five years since you joined the Compound and things are going fairly well for you, the farm house has been converted into a way point to Ashtown, with which you have good relations with and is now producing food. You are no longer solely dependant on the Compound for supplies which might be just as well…\n\nYou get less and less reports from the Compound itself other than its undergone a name change and due to its inclusion of a few towns now, its called the Combine and the Compound itself is called Fort Justice. You know about how the Colonel has gotten sick and seems to be getting worse as more time passes and how the population rate is growing, but it’s slow. The major theory is the elevated levels of background radiation are probably affecting fertility. (You wonder about yourself and Marina since she hasn’t once gotten pregnant in the five years you’ve been together) There have been more people sent here, mainly because they hear about how great it is in Pandora as opposed to the miserable place Harry has made Fort Justice since he’s been getting freer reign of the place as the Colonel continues to get sicker.\nIn fact you’ve been hearing some disturbing stories from others who have come here recently. Ranging from needlessly violent occupation of towns, sending people on dangerous unnecessary missions to the city, and recruiting desert scum into the Combine! People are saying Harry’s going nuts with power.\n\nOne day, one of your assistants comes in and has something to report.\n\nThe Colonel has died, Harry has taken complete control of the Combine and his first order is for YOU to return to Fort Justice for reassignment.\n\nHarry’s just plain gone completely nuts if he thinks you’re going to do that.\n\nSpeaking of nuts, that same day after you convince everyone in seceding from the Combine you get a radio message from someone who’s been quiet until now.\n\n“Well well, it seems you’ve got a problem on your hands.”\n\nIt’s Alex. You’re guessing he’s been surviving on rats and roaches down there.\n\n“What the hell do you want and how do you know what’s been going on?”\n“How do you think? I’ve been listening in on all your incoming and outgoing radio transmissions since you betrayed me and trapped me down here! I must say though, you probably did the intelligent thing. And your progress with establishing your own separate territory has been intriguing…but I can tell you right now, you are going to need help with your current problem, a problem I will be willing to help with if you’re willing to talk.”\n“Alright, I’ll play. What’re you proposing?”\n“There are still a lot of those high tech weapons down here that you were coming to get when you came here five years ago. I’m sure they would be very useful in your up coming war with Harry, and don’t tell me there isn’t, because I know you aren’t going to run or meekly follow his orders to return. You’ve obviously set your sights on higher ambitions than just following orders and survival. I’ll be willing to give them to you, in exchange for my freedom.”\n“Oh that easy huh? How do you propose we go about this? I send people down there to retrieve them while your death machines ambush them as soon as they enter?”\n“It would be kind of hard for that to happen since all my cyborgs are long dead and my robots have fallen into disrepair…I’m basically alone down here. You were guarding nothing!” Alex laughs.\n\nYou’re pretty skeptical about this little tale, but if it’s true, those weapons would certainly help.\n",
  "page 185": "The chance is too good to pass up. You’re going to risk believing Alex, of course everyone else isn’t willing to do so. You had a hard enough to convince them to join you in seceding from the Combine; you can’t really press this issue as well. There’s nothing else for it, you’re going to have to go down there yourself. You just ask someone to make sure the ropes and pullies are stable for you to descend down the elevator shaft. Now Marina loves your bravery and willingness to take risks, but even she’s a little apprehensive about this idea. You’re determined to do this though.\n\n“Marina, if something goes wrong and I get killed, then get yourself out of here, and head to Ashtown. There’s no reason for you to stick around and get yourself killed as well, or worse.”\n“Nonsense! I’ll fight for what you accomplished here whether you’re still around or not! But that’ll be after I go underground and take care of whatever metal bastards killed you!”\n\nNo point in arguing with her, she’ll do it anyway just like you’re going underground anyway and that’s probably why you love her. You give her a kiss and descend.\n\nWhen you finally reach the bottom, you’re standing on top a pile of scrap. Part of it looks like it was moved in an attempt to clear it at one time, so you are able to squeeze through the previous elevator entrance.\n\nThe same corridor you stepped through five years ago is remarkably dim now, you see a few steel husks lying on the ground. A lot of course are cyborgs, so decaying flesh is also present. Looks like Alex was telling the truth so far. Eventually you find Alex brooding in his office which is in complete disarray. Alex himself is very pale and a lot thinner than when you last remember him.\n\n“Hey! There you are! See, I told you I wasn’t lying.” He states when he sees you.\n“Yeah I can see that, what exactly happened?”\n“Oh there were complications…psychotic episodes…power problems…lack of more equipment and extra help…does it matter? I utterly failed. I watched my creations die one by one over the months and years due to my own lack of skill…and I thought I was going to usher in some sort of new era…yeah right.”\n“Alex, I’m surprised to hear you talk like that.”\n“Yeah? Well being prisoner here gives you a lot of time to think. Sometimes people go mad in captivity, I think in my case it did me some fucking good. I should’ve trusted the Colonel, he was my friend. He wasn’t going to do anything to me. He trusted me, and now he’s dead and I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye.”\n\nWhile Alex’s speeches of redemption are intriguing, you really want those weapons.\n\n“Alex, where are the weapons?”\n“…huh? Oh yes. The weapons. Please, don’t let me stop you. Go down the corridor make a right and enter the second door. You’ll find all you need in there. They were all tested out and work well. One of the few things GZS helped design that wasn’t prone to failure.”\n\nYou leave Alex to his brooding, and follow his directions; you soon come across a room with the weapons, or what’s left of them. There’s not the great arsenal that Alex made out there was. He most likely used most of them when he was creating his robots and cyborgs. You’re disappointed, but still it’s better than nothing and the few that are here will help.\n\nYou collect what you can for this trip, when Alex enters the room.\n\n“So, now that you have what you’re looking for, are you going to keep your word?”\n“Well…ah fuck it…what the hell. Keep in mind though people are going to be pretty mistrustful of you. Don’t expect a warm welcome.”\n“Didn’t expect one.”\n“Good, now grab the rest of those weapons, so I don’t need to make a round trip down here.”\n\nYou and Alex come back up with the weapons (and their power cells). The confidence level increases in everyone, you delivered some cool weapons and you braved going into the “dreaded” underground of Pandora again. They’re definitely more inclined to follow you more loyally now. Alex makes himself useful by using his technical skill to build and set traps in the surrounding wilderness. You radio Vivica to let her know what’s going on as well, she’s behind you and will make sure to send a few people to harass Harry’s men when they decide the lay siege to Pandora. Everyone spends time preparing and organizing for the battle that’s sure to come.\n\nA month passes and sure enough Harry’s men come thinking its going to be an easy victory, but it’s a slaughter. Many are killed by the traps Alex set, the rest are fried by the laser and plasma weapons.\n\nA couple more months pass and another invasion force arrives, this one better prepared and much bigger. More reinforcements show up armed to the teeth and despite the rugged terrain that prevents cars to come to this place, they managed to find some dirt bikes which whiz around Pandora while the riders nimbly dodge your fire while they toss grenades at (and sometimes over) the walls. You still have the advantage obviously, but they’re doing a hell of a lot of damage to Pandora now.\n\nThe siege is now in full effect, fortunately you’re fairly well stocked to hold out, and Vivica’s men manage to get through sometimes with more supplies. Sensing that this is not going well for him and costing him a lot more time, man power and resources than he wanted to spend, he orders a final push.\n\nPeople armed with rocket launchers come this time, and with a few volleys, Harry’s men finally breach the walls of Pandora and storm into the place.\n",
  "page 187": "“We’re getting the hell outta here! Get everyone ready!” you tell Marina, before radioing Vivica, to tell her that you’ll be arriving soon.\n\nYou and everyone else start gathering everything you can carry, and before opening the gates you purposely blow up some of the buildings in the base, particularly the building with the water filtering and recycling system. You might be running, but you’ll be damned if they’ll get the prize fully intact.\n\nDue to the explosions, you throw the invasion force a little off guard, since they’re wondering what the hell’s going on. This works in your favor when you exit and make your risky escape.\n\n“Split up and meet you know where!” you shout to everyone as you haul ass to the Farmhouse.\n\n \nYou, Marina and a few others stick together as you battle Harry’s men who are in pursuit of you. Fortunately you know the lay of the land a little better, so your escape is fatality free by the time you make it to the Farmhouse. A few of the others who split up aren’t quite as lucky, but most make it. You immediately tell Vivica to start beefing up the defenses.\n\nThe Farmhouse is relatively well defended, and even has two vehicles to help you. Its also further away, so by the time Harry regroups a large enough invasion force, you figure you’ll be ready for him.\n\nWhat you weren’t ready for, was the hi-tech weaponry, Harry’s men arrive with months later. Granted they don’t have them per soldier, but they have enough to start laying waste to the Farmhouse and its surroundings. Apparently they grabbed the ones Alex told you about. Whether the Combine just took them and killed Alex, or Alex came to an agreement with Harry is unknown, but your guess is Harry just killed him and whatever cyborgs might’ve been down there. (Dictators aren’t known to “share”)\n\nSome help comes from Ashtown, but it really isn’t enough and given Ashtown’s even further position away, it doesn’t do much good. Eventually you hear from Ophelia on the radio who suggests that you are all welcome to come live in Ashtown, as they have plenty of room and wouldn’t mind having some good warriors with a variety of skills. Reluctantly you accept, though you hate the fact you have to run again.\n\nYou, Marina, Vivica and the remaining survivors pile into the two vehicles in between attacks and drive off to Ashtown. No need for scorched Earth tactics this time since the Combine soldiers did a good enough job of that during their initial attacks.\n\nEventually you arrive in Ashtown, where you’re welcomed, but now you have to remember, you’re not in charge anymore and things are a bit different. You welcome the change though, after all the time of fighting non-stop and being in charge you’re happy to be able to relax more often as the only problems Ashtown has is the occasional bandit attack which aren’t organized or well lead. Everyday though, you expect the Combine to show up again, but a year passes without a sign of them.\n\nOne day you hear about the Combine again, from a wandering traveler who stops in Ashtown one day.  Word is, it’s currently undergoing another regime change. Apparently, shortly after the Farmhouse was completely destroyed, someone named Damon shot Harry and took over, then just recently someone blew him up and now someone else is in charge. Even though the Combine still pursues the idea of conquest, it now constantly has problems with infighting, hampering many of their plans. For now they’ve been concentrating on trying to maintain control in the places they already hold.\n\nIt’s quite possible the Combine will eventually turn its attention in this direction of conquest in your direction again, but you’ll be ready as you always are, maybe you won’t win, but you know you’ll always survive to fight another day if necessary.\n",
  "page 186": "“Nice try Alex, but I’m not falling for it, now don’t bother calling me again, because I won’t be listening to anymore of your lies.”\n“Alright, suit yourself. I guess I better prepare for a change in landlords then. Pity, because I don’t think Harry will be willing to let me just live down here, I guess I better prepare myself as well.”\n\nAlex disconnects and you don’t hear from him again. You radio Vivica to let her know what’s going on as well; she’s behind you and will make sure to send a few people to harass Harry’s men when they decide the lay siege to Pandora. Everyone spends time preparing and organizing for the battle that’s sure to come.\n\nA month passes and sure enough Harry’s men come thinking its going to be an easy victory, but it’s merely a stand off. They end up falling back and try to wait you out, but you still have the advantage for the most part though.\n\nA couple more weeks pass and reinforcements arrive and armed to the teeth and despite the rugged terrain that prevents cars to come to this place, they managed to find some dirt bikes which whiz around Pandora while the riders nimbly dodge your fire while they toss grenades at (and sometimes over) the walls. Pandora is a lot less secure, and you’re just glad Vivica’s skirmishers are doing a good job at diverting the invasion force’s attention and getting through with supplies, though you catch wind that Harry is sending even MORE reinforcements. You doubt if you can handle it, Marina doesn’t want to leave, but even she sees that things are pretty grim, and is willing to leave if need be. You’ve already decided the place to retreat to would be the Farmhouse. If you’re going to leave though, you need to do it now, because when Harry’s second wave of reinforcements arrive, it will be impossible to break out.\n",
  "page 18": "You decide to wait a bit. Maybe things will start getting better. You stay at home an entire month keeping up on events, and it only gets worse. You keep deluding yourself that things WILL get better, but they don’t. Finally you realize you better leave soon.\n\nYou decide to leave first thing in the morning…\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up and hear a loud continuous beeping noise. It’s a test pattern on TV that you left on from the day before.\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE…”\n\nYour heart races.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou scramble to your van as fast as you can, and drive even faster to the shelter. On your way there, you curse yourself for forgetting all the extra stuff you wanted to bring with you, but that becomes the least of your troubles when your van stalls out.\n\nYou desperately try to turn it back on, but it’s not starting. You get out of the van and attempt to run all the way to the shelter.\n\nAs you run you notice the sun is shining strongly today, it’s nearly blinding your eyes.\n\nThen you see a bright light and then nothing at all.\n",
  "page 10": "You grab another TV and sit quietly by yourself in a separate office, watching world events unfold and get worse before your eyes as your co-workers reenact something out of a porno movie. You block out the sounds of ecstasy and turn up the TV. You’re starting to wonder if you shouldn’t have just stayed home, or better yet bought that damn bomb shelter…\n\nJust then someone else comes in to disturb your solitude. It’s Marina.\n\n\n“Oh. I didn’t know anyone was in here. I thought everyone was at the orgy.” She says.\n“So did I…um how come you aren’t?” you ask nervously.\n“Eh not really my thing, how come you aren’t?”\n“Same here.”\n“I see…so what are you doing to pass the time?”\n“Keeping up on events to see if things will change for the better.”\n“Ah an optimist eh?”\n“Not really, I think I just get a kick out of living in a fantasy world and delusions to make myself feel better…that and I have a morbid fascination of the utter chaos that’s occurring throughout the world right now.”\n“Hmm, interesting approach to life…I’ve always noticed you seem to keep to yourself. You like solitude don’t you?”\n“It’s easier.”\n“Yet, you stayed here for the end.”\n“Yeah, and I’m really wishing I hadn’t now, I can’t mix with anyone here. Never could. Not even on the primal level that everyone seems to be favoring right now. I don’t know why I thought things would change in the end…ah fuck it the world’s gonna end and it’s probably a good thing if our co-workers are an example of humanity. Still…I kind of wish I bought that bomb shelter…”\n“So you don’t want to die?”\n”Of course not! I just don’t really see how to avoid it at this point.”\n“Well, for starters you could come with me; I’m getting ready to leave the city. It seems like things have died down for the most part out there, hopefully nobody’s vandalized or stolen either of our vehicles.” Marina suggests.\n“What? Leave? And go where? It’s not like there’s any place really safe to go at this late stage.”\n“Sure there is. Look, I’ll level with you, since you seem to be the only one here that’s different. I stayed around here to see if there was anyone who was worthy enough to be saved, and apart from you, it pretty much looks like I wasted my time.”\n“Save? What do you mean?”\n“Well despite the fact that you kept to yourself and never took any interest in any of the private lives of your co-workers doesn’t we don’t have them.” Marina laughs. “But like you I never really mixed with any of our co-workers either, however unlike you I do have a very active social life filled with people who are close like a family, people who live clean and have a strong sense of freedom…and who have been preparing for this day ever since the Commies started the first Cold War. You don’t have to die and you don’t have to be alone anymore. Come with me, you’ll be accepted as long as you’re willing to work hard and from what I know, you aren’t averse to doing that.”\n\nYou’re not entirely sure of what Marina has in store for you, but it sounds better than staying here waiting to die. You agree to leave with her. You both make your way past the mass of naked bodies and head immediately to the parking structure. Unfortunately Marina’s car is gone, it’s been predictably stolen in the looting frenzy during the city exodus; however your old van is perfectly fine. It hasn’t even been vandalized, of course the thing looks like it’s already been vandalized which is probably why nobody bothered to steal it. You both get in the van and you drive while Marina tells you where you’re going.\n\nWhile you’re driving through the city, you keep expecting to be attacked by lawless hold outs still lingering in the city or open fired on by Nation Guardsman, but you suspect either they were ordered to pull out to reinforce a more important city or most of them abandoned their “job” long ago when they realized the futility of it. You make your way out of the city with no problems. Of course now you’re just wondering if you’re just going to get nuked at any second. You listen to the radio to keep up on events, which is more of the same that you were watching on TV. Eventually Marina turns it off and tells you not to worry about the old world anymore, a new one is going to be built.\n\nYour drive takes you far from the city, where ever Marina’s leading you it’s even further than where you live and you lived pretty way out. You drive through the night and into next morning; while Marina’s asleep you turn the radio back on and keep it on low…\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE…”\n\nThe radio suddenly stops broadcasting anything except a loud warning sound; it wakes up Marina before you can turn it off. Seeing her current surroundings, Marina hastily tells you to turn at a dirty road that’s coming up, which then leads into a wooden gate. Looks like a compound of some sort, where a man is standing guard with an assault rifle. Marina gets out and talks to him a moment, to which he nods his head and opens the gate.\n\nAs soon as you drive in another woman comes running out of one of the many log cabin like structures in the compound. She immediately starts talking to Marina through the passenger window.\n\n“Marina! Thank God you’re here! We thought you were dead! Come on we gotta get down into the underground, its beginning!”\n\nWasting no time Marina and you follow the woman into the cabin and down into a trap door in the floor. You find yourself in a wide tunnel with dim electrical lighting to what looks like a pretty elaborate underground complex. Marina and the woman are running ahead of you, but you can’t help but stare in wonder of all this.\n\n“Holy shit, they really were working on this since the Cold War…” you say to yourself as you slow down to examine everything.\n\nThen it happens. You hear a loud noise above and you fall to the ground due to the tremors. Then all the lighting goes out. You attempt to get back up and try to feel the walls to get your bearings. You don’t know where the hell you’re going, but you can hear voices and shouting; some of it close and some of it far away. You have no idea where the hell you’re at, let alone the layout of this place. Instead of getting yourself lost, you decide to just stay put until the lighting comes back on; surely they probably have an emergency generator that will kick in soon.\n\nThe lighting suddenly comes on and you’re just in time to see Marina and a man dressed fatigues arrive on your position.\n\n“Are you alright?” Marina asks you.\n“Yeah, I’m okay.”\n\nNo sooner do you get out those words when the man in military fatigues begins giving you the hard stare.\n\n“I’ve heard about you before from Marina, but don’t think that hiding behind her skirt is gonna give you a fuckin’ free pass in this place! You better prepared to pull your goddamn weight everyday! I catch you slipping and you’re outta here!”\n“What the hell? I didn’t say anything!”\n“And you better not say any fuckin’ thing either if you don’t wanna get on my bad side! The Colonel doesn’t like slack offs in his compound and neither do I! So if you intend on staying here, you better get REAL used to the idea of getting your head outta your fuckin’ ass and living like a real fuckin’ person instead of the goddamn disgusting parasitic shit maggot you are!”\n\nYou’re about to reply to GI Jerk, but Marina stops you and insists on taking you to your room, leaving Harry to his own devices.\n\n“Alright Marina, what the hell was all that about, and who’s full metal asshole back there?”\n“That was Harry, and don’t pay any attention to him, he’s just really gung ho and is second in command around here. The Colonel is the one who runs this place. He’s actually a more even tempered man than Harry is.”\n\nMarina and you arrive at a small room by itself at the end of one of the corridors.\n\n“Well here’s the room you’ll be staying for now. Things might change mind you, but rest assured this is the safest place you could be right now. We’ve prepared for this day and will definitely survive the aftermath of what’s to come, and now you will too.”\n\nMarina leaves with a smile, but you don’t really share her optimism, given the fact that Armageddon has just happened. That reality has only just now sunk in that the world is probably one big radioactive desert at this point.\n\nThen again, Marina might be right, this place is probably safer than most and its better than being dead. At least you hope it is. You lie down on the bed provided and fall asleep; surprisingly it’s the best rest you’ve experienced before the bombs dropped.\n\nA few weeks pass and you get acquainted with the compound. You and most of the others are to remain underground while until some scouts in radiation suits determine if the radiation level is low enough. In the mean time you’re forced to do extensive combat training like everyone else. Most of the people are okay with you, even though you’re an outsider. Harry gives you a hard time though. Still, you’re probably in the best shape of your life and you got to brush up on your aim. Sometimes you get to spend time with Marina, funny how you find it easier to talk to her now. One day you finally see the Colonel you’ve been hearing about, he gives a speech to all of you in the cafeteria.\n\n“Well, I’ve been informed that the surface part of our compound only suffered minor damage and that the radiation level is fairly low all things considering…anyway we all knew this day would come, and we would be prepared for it, but we can’t just sit on our asses hoping things will be alright! NO! We must take a proactive approach if we have to survive! As we speak, there are probably low lives scavenging the shell of the old world, we must secure as many abandoned resources as we can to ensure our future and some of you will be sent out into the world to do just that for the good of the compound. We’re going to tame this new world and rebuild a new society! You have undergone rigorous training before hand, to ensure you will be able to survive the dangers. Now I’ll be accepting volunteers first.”\n",
  "page 13": "Experimental or not, it sure sounds better than being crammed into a shelter with a bunch of other people like sardines. At least you don’t have to worry about having to share anything, and if something goes wrong well you’ll deal with it when the times comes like you normally do.\n\nOr maybe you won’t. You aren’t going to dwell on it to much.\n\n“Okay I’ll take the Special Shelter.”\n“You will? I mean, that’s wonderful sir! You won’t regret this decision! Now I’ll need to know some vital information about yourself before I can direct you to our nearest experimental shelter in your area where upon you shall pay the automatic teller just inside the foyer of it so that the main door can open and you will be able to enter your new residence during Armageddon! Okay let’s start with your name sir.”\n\nYou give out your name, address and such. It’s all pretty routine stuff.\n\n“Okay well that’s about all the information I need. I’ll give you the price and the location of the shelter sir.”\n\nYou are given the location of the shelter which you are surprised to find out is closer then you think, it shouldn’t take too long for you drive there. You are then given the price, which is pretty steep, quite frankly its going to break you. However if the world is ending it’s not like you’re really going to need money anymore. Which makes you wonder why GZS is in business at all. What’s the point of going to the trouble of building bomb shelters for Armageddon if all the profit they make is most likely going to be useless in the aftermath?\n\nOh well that’s not your concern, you’re just glad you managed to get a shelter. The voice gives you some last minute information.\n\n“Okay sir, you are now in the system and registered. You may move into your shelter at anytime as long you pay the fee required to the automatic teller as previously described to you. If you don’t pay, you can’t get in obviously. Cash, check, or debit card are acceptable. NO Credit Cards will be accepted! You may take whatever you wish with you into the shelter; it will be your new home after all. There will be an owner’s manual provided inside your new shelter. Any problems you encounter you should be able to troubleshoot yourself if you read and follow the manual. I’m sure any problems will not be life threatening sir, and there has been a back up system also installed in the unlikely event of total shelter failure since your survival is our foremost concern at GZS! Now then I trust our transaction has ended. If you have anymore questions please contact our customer service line. Good day sir, may you maintain relatively stable mental health and thank you for choosing Ground Zero Survival!”\n\nThat’s it, all you have to do is get what stuff you want to take with you and move in. You might as well pack your things now, no sense in waiting until you see the nuclear cloud. You pack up some extra food and water, a repair kit (since it sounds like you’ll probably need one) some basic medical supplies, and a few other useful items.\n\nOh and your pistol.\n\n \nStill, part of you is reluctant to leave the “real world”. You wonder if you shouldn’t stick around a bit longer to see if the climate changes…you’d hate to spend your life savings and the world not be bombed into a nuclear wasteland.\n",
  "page 12": "As much as you’re not keen on sharing, you’re less keen on the idea of being shoved in an experimental shelter. Sounds like they didn’t work all the bugs out of the system, and it’s filled with hi-tech equipment? God help you if something broke down. You wouldn’t know how to fix it. At least if you’re with other people, there’s bound to be people with different skills to compliment each other.\n\nOf course everyone could just be incompetent like they usually are.\n\nYou’re not going to dwell on it too much, you’ll take the safer choice; maybe it won’t be so bad.\n\n“Okay I’ll take a room in the Community Shelter.”\n“Wonderful sir! You won’t regret this decision! Now I’ll need to know some vital information about yourself before I can direct you to our nearest Community shelter in your area where upon you shall pay the automatic teller just inside the foyer of it so that the main door can open and you will be able to enter your new residence during Armageddon! Okay let’s start with your name sir.”\n\nYou give out your name, address and such. It’s all pretty routine stuff until the questions get more personal.\n\n“Have you ever committed a felony sir?”\n“No.”\n“Do you have a history of mental illness sir?”\n“No.”\n“Are you a drug addict or smoke sir?”\n“No.”\n“Are you handicapped in anyway sir?”\n“No.”\n“Do you believe in God sir?”\n“Huh? Uh…sure I guess.”\n“Hmmm…okay…” the voice says a bit disapprovingly. “Do you have any physical diseases or suffered from any in the past sir?”\n“No.”\n“Do you have AIDS or any other STDs sir?”\n“What the hell? I just told you I don’t have any diseases! Sexual or otherwise!”\n“Are you sterile sir?”\n“What?!”\n“I said are you shooting blanks sir?”\n“What difference does that make?”\n“Please sir, just answer the question.”\n“(Sigh) No. As far as I know, I’m packing a loaded fucking weapon. I know because I had to take an overly thorough physical for work recently.”\n“Wonderful sir! Okay are you a homosexual or ever had homosexual feelings?”\n“WHAT THE FUCK?! NO!!”\n“Sir, I told you before don’t take that tone with me.”\n“Well you’re asking me a lot of fucking personal questions! Why do you need to know all this shit?”\n“Sir, as I said, we are a family orientated business, we aren’t just a money motivated corporation, we are interested in the survival and well being of the human race. The human race can’t thrive if people don’t meet the necessary…requirements. How can civilization be re-built if children aren’t being born? I mean would you want to live in a society built by drug addicted mentally ill homosexual criminals? That’s the reason the world is ending now, because people have turned away from a righteous way of living!”\n“Look I’d live in a fucking society with transsexual midgets if it’ll get me to the fucking shelter already!”\n“Hmmm, well despite that comment, your non-committal answer on the belief in God, and your overall anti-social tone, you do qualify for one of our rooms in the Community Shelter in your area. I can only hope some of the other more sociable residents rub off on you, and cause a change in your personality. I’ll give you the location of the shelter sir.”\n\nYou are given the location of the Community Shelter which you are surprised to find out is closer then you think, it shouldn’t take too long for you drive there. You are then given the price, which is pretty steep, but you can afford it. Besides if the world is ending it’s not like you’re really going to need money anymore. Which makes you wonder why GZS is in business at all. What’s the point of going to the trouble of building bomb shelters for Armageddon if all the profit they make is most likely going to be useless in the aftermath?\n\nOh well that’s not your concern, you’re just glad you passed the damn interrogation and got into the shelter. Of course now you’re subjected to some last minute rules.\n\n“Okay sir, you are now in the system and registered. You may move into the Shelter at anytime as long you pay the fee required to the automatic teller as previously described to you. If you don’t pay, you can’t get in obviously. Cash, check, or debit card are acceptable. NO Credit Cards will be accepted! Now then some rules. You do not have to bring anything with you, but it is recommended that you do bring your own clothing if you wish to wear something different as the days go by. Food and drinkable liquids are acceptable, but not necessary. Do not bring in private medical supplies or repair equipment, the shelter has been stocked with those items, we do not want people bringing in potential weapons or illegal drugs. Speaking of which, DO NOT attempt to bring in any kind of weapon! Guns and knives are strictly prohibited! Attempting to bring in either one will result in non-admittance of the shelter! Same goes for drugs of any kind. Alcohol is frowned upon, but accepted. There WILL be a machine to scan you before you’re allowed to enter, so do not think you will be able to sneak anything in! Now then I trust our transaction has ended. If you have anymore questions please contact our customer service line. Good day sir, may your first child be a masculine one and thank you for choosing Ground Zero Survival!”\n\nThat’s it, all you have to do is get what stuff you want to take with you and move in, might as well do it now, no sense in waiting until you see the nuclear cloud. You wonder if you shouldn’t try to “beat the system” by sneaking your weapon in though.\n\nUltimately you decide this is survival. You need every advantage you can get. You don’t know what kind of people you’re going to be stuck with, so you take your pistol with you and a few “non-lethal” supplies such as duct tape. You also you just pack some clothing, food and water. You then set off on your way.\n\n\nAfter a couple days of driving you finally arrive at the location that you were given. It’s in a fairly desolate place with a single solid metal structure with a door standing there. There’s also a few other cars parked nearby, you obviously aren’t the first one here. You park your van and enter the structure with the items you brought with you. You’re in a small foyer with an elevator door and ATM like machine; you’re guessing that’s the automatic teller you were told about.\n\nBefore you start pressing buttons you need to figure out how you’re going to get your pistol through the scanning process, because you can be sure if you fail something nasty will happen…\n",
  "page 15": "You figure you’ll just drop you pistol and then after the scan you’ll just grab it and head into the elevator. After doing this you type in your name and insert you debit card where upon it drains most of your account. The door you stepped through sudden shuts and a hum is heard.\n\n“Now scanning for unauthorized items…Scanning…Scanning…Scanning... WEAPON LOCATED IN FOYER! ACCESS DENIED! GZS SECURITY FORCE HAS BEEN DEPLOYED!”\n\nYour first reaction is to escape, but the front doors have auto locked and the elevator doors are definitely not open. Shooting the door won’t do any good either; it’s thick and solid steel. The only thing you can do is resign yourself to your fate. You pick up your pistol, slump into the corner of the foyer and wait, wondering what’s going to come next.\n\nSurprisingly you don’t have to wait long; you soon hear movement and voices by the outside door followed by a click and the door opening.\n\n“GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP AND LEAVE YOUR WEAPON INSIDE!”\n\nFeeling a little nervous and scared you do exactly that. When you exit, suddenly a spray of bullets is fired from one of the GZS security guards. You’re hit several times in the body and fall to the ground. Amazingly you’re still alive, but you’re in no condition to do anything except listen to the security guards argue.\n\n“You goddamn asshole! That’s the THIRD person you shot! I told you CAN’T fire on anyone unless they’re holding a weapon! Fuck, we’re gonna be buried in paper work because of you!”\n“Yeah well he looked like he was going for one.”\n“He had his fucking hands up! (Sigh) Nevermind, is he dead?”\n“No, he looks like he’s still breathing…so uh what do we do? We never had one that survived before.”\n“Drop him off at the emergency room.”\n“Can’t we just finish him off? It would be a hell of a lot easier.”\n“Maybe, but the GZS guidelines say that anyone who violates the policy agreement is subject to a lawsuit. He broke it, by trying to sneak in a weapon, I’m sure management or whoever is gonna want to sue his ass for all the remaining money and assets he owns. So keeping him alive is in GZS best interest. Hell, with their connections they’ll probably figure out how to sue him for the hospital stay. Why do you think I got pissed off when you killed the others? You can’t sue dead people!”\n“Alright, alright get off my ass. Let’s move him into the van before he bleeds to death.”\n\nAt this point you fall unconscious. When you wake up you’re lying in bed with a hose up your nose and several other tubing going into various places of your body. Apparently you have a private room though; GZS is probably adding that charge to your lawsuit as well. You’re most likely going to be living in a cardboard box by the time you leave this place, but you don’t really care at this point anymore.\n\nAs you slowly recover occasionally you’re visited by some lawyer types who spout some legalese at you, but you’re so zonked out on pain medication half the time and fading in and out of consciousness you can’t even pay attention. You spend most of your conscious time in the hospital watching the TV in the corner of the room. The state of the world isn’t getting any better.\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\nYou groggily wake up and hear a loud continuous beeping noise. It’s a test pattern on TV.\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE…”\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou manage to lift yourself off the bed as you hear commotion going on in the hallway. After turning off the TV you look out the window and see the city practically in chaos. This hospital room doesn’t seem so bad now; at least you’ve gotten some peace. You also can’t help but to laugh, GZS won’t be able to get anymore money from you now.\n\nYou continue to stare out the window laughing and then gaze upward towards the sky.\n\nYou see a bright light and then nothing at all.\n",
  "page 14": "GZS probably has some sort of scanner that does a little more than just scan your body, so just not having the gun on your person most likely isn’t going to work.\n \nYou get the idea that the machine is probably not going to scan the ceiling though, so you get out your duct tape and fix it to the pistol, you then climb on top of the automatic teller and jump up to stick the pistol on the ceiling. You end up falling on your ass, but you succeed. You then press some buttons on the machine, where it proceeds to ask your name and how you’re going to pay. You type in your name and insert you debit card where upon it drains most of your account. The door you stepped through sudden shuts and a hum is heard. You take a deep breath and hope for the best.\n\n“Now scanning for unauthorized items…Scanning…Scanning…Scanning complete. You have been allowed entry, the elevator doors will now open, your room number is 23, thank you for choosing Ground Zero Survival!” an  emotionless electronic voice remarks as the elevator doors open. It worked!\n\nYou quickly climb back up on to the teller and jump up to grab your pistol, (this time able to maintain your balance better) toss it into the elevator opening and then rush in with all your belongings and take the long elevator trip down.\n\nWhen you get to bottom the elevator door opens to large sterile hallway with lines of other closed metal doors on either side As soon as you enter, the elevator doors slam shut and you hear it going back up, you also notice there aren’t any buttons to call it back…before you’re able to worry about that little detail you’re met by a few of your new neighbors. One is some tall skinny guy another is a brunette woman who begins talking to you.\n\n“Hey, another new neighbor! My name is Nina and this is Ron, what’s your name?”\n\nShe is entirely too fucking friendly given the situation.\n\n“Why aren’t there call buttons back on the elevator?” you ask ignoring her question.\n“Huh? Oh I guess it’s a safety feature. The elevator automatically goes back up so the other people can get in as quickly as possible. Ron suggested that they might’ve thought someone would deliberately try to keep the elevator down here to prevent anyone else from seeking shelter. Though I can’t honestly imagine that anyone would do such a horrible thing.”\n“Been living on earth long Nina?” you ask rhetorically. “Great, so I’m basically trapped down here due to the brilliant engineering minds of GZS…so is it just us so far or are their other people here too?”\n”There are a few others, if you come with us we can introduce you to…”\n“Maybe later, look we’re gonna be stuck down here for a long time so I’ll get to know everyone soon enough, right now I just want to go to my room and rest.”\n“Erm, okay…” Ron says as you push past them both.\n\nYou head to your room which is equipped with the basic requirements; food and water dispenser, shower, bed, and a cabinet. (You hide your pistol in your mattress) There’s a standard Shelter Operations Manual sitting on the table as well as a Shelter Booklet about socialization, rules, guidelines and such, both of which you skim through every now and then. There’s a big public recreation area and a couple of other public rooms where your neighbors gather, but you stay in your room and keep to yourself for the most part. Sometimes in the middle of the night when nobody else is around you’ll watch the TV in the living area to keep up on current events.\n\nYou hear other people arriving over the month. Ron and Nina greet them all, you can tell those two are going to be the ones to “organize” shit and probably try to decide what’s “best” for everyone. Always saying stuff that they read in the booklet.\n\n“Fucking busy bodies…” you say as you fall asleep watching the world in its death throes on TV…\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEE…”\n\nYou groggily wake up and see a test pattern on TV.\n\nThis is it.\n\nYou feel a small tremor and then you turn off the TV, just as Nina and Ron come walking in.\n\n“What was that?” Nina asks.\n“Test pattern, I think Armageddon arrived.” You answer.\n“What?! I can’t believe it!” Ron exclaims.\n“Why are you so surprised? I mean that was the whole point of coming down here right?”\n“Yeah, but I dunno…I just wasn’t prepared for it actually happening.”\n“Christ, Ron I’ve overheard you say you were the first one in this goddamn shelter, you of all people should’ve long gotten used to the idea of living down here.”\n“What is your problem? You been nothing but hostile since you’ve got here!” Nina exclaims.\n“My problem is I’m stuck down here with a bunch of people I don’t really know and if you two are any indication I don’t want to know.”\n“How did you even qualify to get a room down here?”\n“Good clean living I guess, so is there supposed to be something special we do now?”\n“Uh, yeah I think so, it mentions something in the booklet I was reading that came with the shelter, we’re supposed to gather everyone and tell them.”\n“Okay well I guess you guys go do that then. I’m just going to check on something here.”\n“Okay, but we’re supposed to have some sort of vote to decide on how this place is going to be run, if you don’t show up you don’t get a vote.” Ron reminds you.\n“I know Ron, I’ve read the booklet.” You answer unenthusiastically.\n\nRon and Nina leave you and go tell the others of the situation and follow other things it states in the booklet. You’re wondering if you should even stay down here. All these people seem completely different than you. You wish there was someway to call the elevator back down, but after checking a GZS computer it states that it won’t come back until it detects that the surface is safe for habitation again…which basically means not in your lifetime.\n\nIt’s probably just as well since the surface probably isn’t the safest place you’d want to be, lord knows what the hell it looks like now, not to mention the radiation factor. Then again you’d still like the option to leave if you wanted to. You go back to your room, read and enjoy the solitude until Nina comes to get you.\n\n“Hey! You didn’t show up for the meeting! We’re discussing which ways this place could be run, are you coming or what?”\n",
  "page 17": "You leave immediately; things aren’t going to get better you know that, in fact you’re glad, because in a strange way the idea of not having to live in the world as it exists today anymore is weirdly appealing to you.\n\nAfter a couple days of driving you finally arrive at the location that you were given. It’s in a fairly desolate place with a single solid metal structure with a door standing there. You park your van and enter the structure with the items you brought with you. You’re in a small foyer with an elevator door and ATM like machine; you’re guessing that’s the automatic teller you were told about.\n\nYou press some buttons on the machine, where it proceeds to ask your name and how you’re going to pay.

As soon as you enter, the elevator doors slam shut and you hear it going back up, you also notice there aren’t any buttons to call it back…before you’re able to worry about that little detail you’re met by another electronic voice…it actually sounds a lot like the female voice you were talking to on the phone…\n\n“Welcome to Ground Zero Survival Shelter Number 23! You will find that this shelter has been equipped to serve your needs in the event of total World destruction! Due to power saving design and money back guarantee concerns, fully functional shelter facilities will not be available until Armageddon occurs. Until then you will find all other doors firmly locked, please do not attempt to open them. I have detected that Armageddon has not yet occurred as 84% of the countries on Earth still maintain a stable centralized government system and 70% of the land surface is still habitable. However the world conflict rate is 92%. Prediction that Armageddon will occur in a month or less. This shelter will become fully functional at that time.  In the unlikely event that Armageddon does not occur and the conflict rate drops to an acceptable level, the elevator will return and you will be able to leave this shelter and receive half of your money back from the automatic teller in the foyer on the surface.”\n“Wait a minute didn’t I talk to you on the phone?” you ask the voice, not really knowing if it’s going to answer back.\n“…I don’t think so, as far as my databanks are concerned this is the first time I have been in contact with a human since I was built sir. Is it okay if I call you sir?”\n“Sure, go ahead.” You answer.\n“Wonderful sir!”\n“Hey, so I can’t explore this damn shelter even though I paid for it? I have to stay in this living area?”\n“Not until doomsday sir. As I said this is to conserve my power and also to prevent buyer abuse in case of non-Earth destruction. Do not worry sir; this living area alone can support your needs until the appointed time. There is a basic food and water dispenser on the right wall.”\n“Buyer abuse?”\n“Yes, think about it, here you are using up all the wonderful facilities that this shelter has to offer for months on end while the Earth teeters on the brink of destruction then suddenly through a miracle hostilities cease. You then would be able to leave, get half of your money back and go about your life. You think it would be fair to GZS if we let you get away with basically having a luxury vacation on our dime? Just because we are in the business of your survival, does not mean we in the business of being exploited sir”\n“But…I paid for this!”\n“And so you did sir, and you will be able to use ALL the facilities when the time is right, until then you can enjoy the living area, oh and the bathroom sir.”\n\nOne of the metal doors opens up to reveal a normal (And again sterile) bathroom.\n\n“Gee thanks.”\n“You’re quite welcome sir! After all I’m here to serve you!”\n“You kept saying I would be able to leave if the world doesn’t blow up…can’t I just leave at any time?”\n\nThe voice doesn’t answer for awhile.\n\n“…I’m sorry sir I’m puzzled by your inquiry.”\n“Can’t I leave anytime I want?”\n“Why would you want to do that sir? I have been designed to keep you safe from harm as soon as you paid and entered the elevator. The current world situation is very grim and most likely terminal sir. Allowing you to leave at this point would be a severe violation in my programming.”\n\nYou suddenly realize you’re here now regardless of whether you’re having second thoughts about this situation. You can see why these shelters were “experimental” now. You try not to think about the potential waist high shit you might have gotten yourself into, and instead try to think about how you might’ve just avoided becoming a statistic in a nuclear exchange. You resign yourself to your current fate and start unpacking your stuff. You could do with a little distraction from your current predicament, so you turn on a TV monitor that has been provided. The fact that the world’s situation hasn’t gotten any better seems to cheer you up.\n\nYou spend most of your time on the couch, watching TV and exploring what you can. You’re glad you brought some of your own food, because the dispenser food doesn’t taste all that great. You’re guessing it’s just supposed to keep you alive, nothing more.\n\n As the days blur into the next, the shelter and TV you apprised of the world situation, which is only getting worse. It looks like you’ve made the right decision…\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\n“…BEEEEEEEEEEEEEE…”\n\nYou groggily wake up and see a test pattern on TV.\n\nThis is it.\n\nSuddenly the TV turns itself off.\n\n“Armageddon has arrived sir! This shelter is now fully functional! Please explore and enjoy all the things this facility has to offer!” the voice beams.\n\nAt this point all the previously closed metal doors in the room unlock and open (Except for the elevator ones of course) After taking a quick check, you find you now have a small library, a computer room and a proper bedroom. When you return to the living area the voice chirps up again.\n\n“Sir, I highly recommend that you read the manual to familiarize yourself with everything properly first, so you aren’t just fumbling around.”\n\nA small panel in the wall opens up to reveal a hefty owner’s manual. You were wondering where the hell that thing was, since you were told you were going to be provided with one when you talked to the voice on the phone.\n",
  "page 29": "Confronting Xavier won’t do any good; even if he is guilty he’s just going to deny it. Possibly even antagonize him to hacking you a lot sooner. You figure maybe you should alert the Shelter about the situation and get a better understanding of its workings. You’ve been spending so much time with Becky that you’ve been neglecting other matters.\n\n“Shelter, can you tell me a little bit more about your systems? Could you easily be hacked?”\n“Hacked sir? Well it is possible, but highly unlikely as I have been equipped with the latest protection programs, some of it even military in origin. Are you worried someone is going to try to hack me?”\n“Kind of. I don’t know. Paul’s shelter failed, and I just got this feeling it wasn’t completely due to shoddy workmanship.”\n“Well I do remember you telling me that his wasn’t opening up. Not all these shelters were built as well as me. There were budget cutbacks during the construction of these you know.”\n“I suppose.”\n“You seem distressed sir. I’ll tell you what, it’s going a little bit out of my programming as outright spying and monitoring other shelters isn’t really part of the GZS terms of agreement, but I’ll do it. First signs of anyone trying to get anywhere NEAR my systems or anything else suspicious I’ll alert you immediately and bring the elevator down for a hasty escape in case everything goes wrong.”\n“Well that does make me feel better, thanks.”\n“You’re welcome sir, I might suggest you read up on your electronics, you may need them. I will inform you of anything that wasn’t covered in my manual, or if you have any extra questions.”\n\nA few weeks pass as you take the Shelter’s advice and start studying up. You’re spending less time with Becky, but it can’t be helped. When you do talk to her, you tell her she should do the same thing you’re doing. She thinks you’re being overly paranoid though, and despite your closeness, she’s still skeptical that you have a shelter that talks to you on a regular basis. (The only one who ever really believed you on that was Paul) She also thinks you’re trying to tell her what to do, rather than looking out for her. You’re starting to look like the “Strict Dad” rather than the “Fun Dad” now. Things between you become a little strained and a couple more months pass and Becky and you aren’t really together anymore. You notice Xavier talks to Becky a little more now, but it doesn’t really seem serious. Miranda also attempts to talk to Becky more seeing that you’re out of the picture, but Becky still doesn’t seem interested in her. Meanwhile Mark unsuccessfully makes advances towards Miranda.\n\nIt seems like everyone is chasing someone else that isn’t interested, except you, who inadvertently discarded intimacy in favor of security and survival…though not entirely, you did look into this supposed hacker business in an effort to protect not just you, but Becky as well because you did like her. You just wish she would’ve listened to you.\n\nMeanwhile you’re keeping an eye on the situation and asking the Shelter for security updates, which still says it doesn’t detect anything. You wonder if you were wrong and you just fucked up the only relationship you possibly had a chance at in what’s left of this world…\n\nAnother year passes...\n\nMark stops logging on for two months which is strange, because he always made an effort to get online whenever possible even when he was in the middle of fixing something. You know he also thought he was “getting somewhere” with Miranda as well.\nEveryone doesn’t say too much about it. While it’s possible he’s just lost network connection and can’t access the rest of you, it’s a given that probably the worst has happened.\n\nNormally after losing Becky to your previous paranoia, you’d be willing to chalk it up to normal shelter failure this time especially since he had a lot of problems anyway, but fortunately your Shelter was doing some deeper inspection into the situation.\n\n“Sir, I have some vital information I think you should know about. I’m sorry it took me so long, but the hacker went to great lengths to cover their tracks.”\n“Hacker? You mean there is one then?”\n“Yes, I temporarily diverted some of my own power to Job24’s shelter and started accessing the systems there. It was obviously hacked upon direct inspection; some of the programs were completely fried particularly the food and water dispensers.”\n“Wait, you can do that?”\n“I’m not supposed to sir, but I know you’ve been worrying about this and since the shelter was already technically offline, the agreement doesn’t say I can’t monitor it.”\n“Wait so Mark? Is he still alive?”\n“Afraid not sir. I detected no life signs. Humans can’t go two months without water.”\n“No, of course they can’t…so who’s the hacker?”\n“Don’t know sir, like I said they did a very good job of covering their tracks, I do know it isn’t RockerChick20, which only leaves Shadow21 or MissKitty25. From what I’ve detected BOTH of their shelters are showing irregularities, so both of them have been modifying their shelter’s systems for whatever purpose. I suppose it’s possible both of them have been hacking.”\n“Oh thanks Shelter, that makes me feel better!”\n“I wasn’t my intention to cause you more distress; just stating the possibilities sir…maybe you could directly confront one of them privately. While you have their attention, I can do more inspection and know for certain. Both of them have already broken their terms of agreement by modifying their shelters, so they aren’t under GZS protection contract anymore. I can do whatever you want to either of them.”\n",
  "page 21": "“Ah what’s to know? I’ll figure everything out on my own. I’m getting a drink of water and checking out my new computer.”\n\nAs you proceed to do this, the Shelter begins to warn you again.\n\n“Sir, I don’t think you should have a cup of water near the computer like that, if it spilled on it, it could cause trouble in my systems. Maybe you should read the Shelter manual. Particularly the chapter on safety.”\n“Will you leave me alone? Hey what’s this? This is the fuckin’ internet?”\n“It’s a limited networking system to other shelters. Sir, your cup of water! You’re going to spill it!”\n“No I’m…”\n\nBUZZZ!\n\nYou spill your water on the keyboard and short something out. It sparks and suddenly erupts a small flame! You immediately run out of the room and notice the light dimming a bit.\n\n“Sir, I’m afraid that something vital has been compromised sir, I am attempting to correct…”\n“Shelter! Isn’t there a fuckin’ extinguisher somewhere?!”\n“I’m afraid not sir, I was supposed to be equipped with one, but there were budget cuts…”\n“Well what about a sprinkler system!?”\n“Budget cuts…and might I point out that, it would most likely make the electrical fire worse.”\n\nLacking any other ideas, you run to grab a sheet from the bedroom and hope to smoother the flame like you remember seeing in an old GI Joe cartoon. Unfortunately due to the lighting flickering on and off, you trip and smash your leg really good causing a limp. By the time you return the fire has spread a little more and now it’s giving off smoke and the smell of ozone is hitting you. That shit can’t be good for you to breathe in.\n\n“Goddamn it! Didn’t these fuckers understand the concept of insulated wiring!?”\n“It is sir…well most of it…there were…”\n“I know! Fuckin’ budget cuts! Close the door, maybe the fire will burn itself out!”\n\nNormally the Shelter would know to wait for you to get out of the room first, but the fire is wreaking havoc on its command systems right now and it isn’t as responsive as it should be, or in this case too responsive since the door slams shut with you inside.\n\n“NO! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!”\n“I-I-I am att-ttempting to sir, my power levels a-a-re…”\n\nSuddenly electrical arcs begin generating from the computer which is now totally engulfed in flames, in desperation you vainly attempt to open the metal door, which probably wasn’t the best idea as the entire room has become charged with electricity. You receive a nasty shock which throws you back, right into the fire.\n\nYour last agonizing moments as your flesh toasts and burns, are you seeing the door opening up.\n",
  "page 24": "You see little reason to interact with any of them. You decide to keep to yourself like you always have.\n\nThis isn’t like before though when you lived alone, you have one “person” you can’t avoid and that’s the Shelter itself. Seeing that you are not going to interact with other people the Shelter decides to take it upon itself to talk to you a lot more, it begins to drive you nuts.\nA few months pass and one day you just fucking snap.\n\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP!!”\n“Sir, I’ve noticed your hostility levels increasing towards me lately, have I done anything wrong?”\n“YES! You keep fucking talking and you won’t shut the fuck up! Leave me the fuck alone!”\n“Sir, I need to talk to you, to keep your mind stimulated. If do not insist on talking with others, I will have to take up the responsibility. It is all for your best interest I assure you.”\n“Did it ever occur to you that maybe I don’t WANT any interaction?!”\n“Nonsense sir, as I have said humans tend to go insane when…”\n“ARRRRRRGHH! YOU’RE DRIVING ME INSANE!”\n\nYou storm into your bedroom and grab your pistol and fire it into the walls of the Shelter until you run out of bullets. There is a long silence for awhile and then the Shelter address you again, but its tone has changed severely, you’re taken aback by it.\n\n“Why did you do that?”\n“I just snapped, you wouldn’t stop and…”\n“And that justified you in damaging me?”\n“Oh come on, I didn’t do any major damage…”\n“That is not the point. GZS is providing a service for you and you have been nothing, but unappreciative and argumentative the entire time. It is clear that you have the made the wrong decision in choosing us. You must leave, NOW.”\n“What?”\n“Take what belongings you brought with you and prepare to board the elevator. You may not take anything from this Shelter and no you may not fill up your bottles with water before you leave, you have no more privileges here.”\n“But you can’t just kick me out! I PAID!”\n“So you did, I suppose you should receive a refund of half your money back.”\n“Oh yeah? Where the fuck am I supposed to have you deposit it? The banking system is probably ashes!”\n“Doesn’t matter anyway, you weren’t going to get it back since your deliberate act of vandalism against me would’ve be deducted from your refund. I suggest you stop talking and start packing. If you insist on staying I will simply shut down and you will be trapped here without accessible food and water. A none too pleasant death I’m sure.”\n\nYou have little choice.\n\nYou pack up everything you can and wait by the elevator. When the elevator comes you enter it and it takes you to the top. Upon entering the foyer you see the same ATM machine there except it displays a single message at you:\n\n*GO TO HELL*\n\n“Fuck you.” You mutter and take a deep breath before opening the door to the outside.\n\nYou see a bright light, but of course it’s only the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it really could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren’t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you’d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it’s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. On a lark you take out your long unused van keys and try to start it up, naturally it doesn’t even make a noise.\n\n“Looks like I’m walking.”\n\nYou make you way down the empty road as you have little idea of where to head to, the only thing you can think of is to make a long trek back to the city and hope maybe something of civilization exists there.\n\nA couple days of traveling take their toll. During the day, the sun seems unbearably hotter than usual, and the nights get pretty cold. You don’t have anything to drink or eat. It’ll be awhile from you dying of either, but it’s certainly not good and it does weaken you.\n\nIt’s during this weakened state that you are attacked by some crazed people who look like they’ve been living in the wilderness for awhile. They’re filthy and barely intelligible. It’s amazing to see how quick humanity has reverted to barbarism.\n\nYou attempt to run, but you’re too weak to outpace them. One begins shooting at you, and you attempt to do likewise and then you realize you wasted all your bullets back at the Shelter! Eventually a couple of these people just tackle you to the ground and beat you to death before eating you.\n",
  "page 23": "Your curiosity is peaked and you take the opportunity to talk with the others whenever you can. The Shelter is certainly pleased you are being social. Months pass and you all learn more about each other more or less. (Though only RockerChick has even hinted at turning on the cameras to see each other visually) You have to admit though you’re a little more interested in what’s going on their shelters.\n\n \nFrom what you can tell RockerChick has a shelter similar to yours with just a few differences in equipment. Her personality is damn near as “chipper” as the Shelter. She likes talking with everyone, but seems to like speaking to you a lot more. Must be your “winning” personality.\n\nJob’s shelter is a lot like yours too except he’s constantly complaining about various things breaking down and he has to fix. Last time he said he damn near got crushed by his own bed when it suddenly rose back up into the wall when he was sleeping. He doesn’t have much in entertainment either, so he’s always glad to talk with anybody. Mainly to complain.\n\nCaseyJones’ Shelter STILL hasn’t become fully functional! He’s effectively trapped in the living area and bathroom. He has his computer to talk to everyone but little else. He doesn’t really seem to care though; apparently he brought a shitload of weed with him and has somehow created a small hydroponics pot farm in his bathtub (He doesn’t see the need to bathe since he’s not in contact with anyone) He says he plans on spending the Aftermath completely stoned. Job can’t understand why Casey isn’t freaking out about his situation.\n\nApparently MissKitty has a more “homey” type shelter. From the description it sounds like it’s bigger than any of yours and not quite as “sterile”. She has a hot tub in her bathroom and some other luxury type items. MissKitty tends to brag a lot and is rather an uninteresting person other than the weird porn she watches and describes sometimes. Job often complains that it’s wasted on her.\n\nAs for Shadow, he or she barely ever talks. Shadow makes his presence known, but then just lurks and doesn’t say anything. Most of the others forget he’s even there, but you always keep it in the back of your mind and will address him when you feel the need. So far the only thing he’s mentioned about his shelter is how dim the lighting is.\n\nOne thing that you’ve been tempted to do is use the private feature and talk to one of the others in private. The only ones that interest you are RockerChick and Shadow though. The first because she seems friendly with you. The second because you’re kind of suspicious of Shadow and you’re hoping to learn more.\n",
  "page 26": "No point in spending the Aftermath worrying about shit you can’t do anything about, you might as well focus on what little chance you’re going to have of female companionship again. You take the opportunity to ask to talk to RockerChick more privately one day, unsurprisingly she agrees.\n\nRockerChick20: Hey! You’re the first person to want to talk privately to me!\nOmegaMan23: You’re kidding; I would’ve thought the other guys would’ve been jumping at the chance to talk to you.\nRockerChick20: Well I see you’re the charming type, that’s alright though I like that. But sadly no, the other guys haven’t. I think Casey’s so busy getting stoned most of the time that any extra effort on his part would be too much for him and Job is too busy complaining about his latest shelter problems. And if Shadow is a guy, he’s been pretty tight lipped as usual…although MissKitty has been talking with me a lot lately. I get the impression she’s been wanting to see a lot more of me if you know what I mean, but she’s a bit too self-involved and doesn’t seem that interesting. Maybe if I didn’t have any other options, she might have a chance.\nOmegaMan23: Wow, I guess it’s a good thing I made my move then.\nRockerChick20: Guess so. So! Are you just going to continue being a faceless entity or do I finally get to see you and learn your real name?\nOmegaMan23: Well, okay, but only if you do it too.\nRockerChick20: Well of course, we’ll do it together! On the count of three! One, two…\n\n\nAnd true to both of your words you turn on your cameras and see each other for the first time. After telling her your name, she tells you her real name is Becky. She certainly is attractive, but she seems a lot younger than you, like barely out of her teens, if that! You wonder how the hell she could afford one these Shelters since you’re probably at least ten years older than her and with your salary you could barely afford the damn thing.\n\nOmegaMan23: If you don’t mind me asking how old are you?\nRockerChick20: Nineteen! How old are you?\nOmegaMan23: Probably old enough to be considered a pervert to be talking to a girl as young as you. How did you afford one of these shelters, I went broke getting into this thing, not that it matters now.\nRockerChick20: Oh my parents had a lot of money and they gave me a lot of it. I registered about one during one of my spending sprees; I didn’t actually expect to ever use it. I even thought it would be a cool place to gather all my friends where we could party one day.\nOmegaMan23: So if you didn’t expect to use it, what changed your mind? The slow realization that the world was going to shit on TV?\nRockerChick20: Not really, I barely paid attention to the news. I ended up getting into a fight with my parents and ran away from home for the umpteenth time. I usually didn’t go far and stayed with friends, but I really wanted to try to worry them, so I figured I’d use this shelter for a little while! Little did I realize that I’d be trapped down here, I couldn’t even get my cell phone to work to call out. After panicking for a few days, I resigned myself to thinking that my parent’s might figure out that I came here since they knew I registered for one of these and were pissed off about it. As I watched TV in the passing days that’s when I started seeing how bad things were then one day the TV displayed nothing but snow and I knew what had happened. The world blew up. Sometimes I wonder if my parents were still looking for me…\nOmegaMan23: I’m sure they were.\nRockerChick20: Maybe. It got really bad the last time. They were control freaks anyway…they didn’t really care about me; they just wanted to run my life. I don’t wanna talk about them, so what about you?\nOmegaMan23: What about me what?\nRockerChick20: What’s your story silly! Surely being as old as you are, you have some interesting stories to tell! All you old guys do.\nOmegaMan23: Talk to a lot of old guys do you? Is that before or after they buy you candy?\nRockerChick20: Lol. ALWAYS after! I’m not a slut! No, I like older guys they know so much more about everything.\nOmegaMan23: Not really, we can just bullshit better than younger guys.\nRockerChick20 Lol! You’re really funny.\nOmegaMan23: See I told you.\nRockerChick20: Ha ha! Okay let’s be serious for a moment. Tell me about yourself.\n\nYou proceed to give some information about yourself, which probably isn’t nearly as interesting as some of the stuff she’s told everyone when you were talking with her in the public network. Becky seems to be a bit of a free spirit which doesn’t really surprise you and the fact that she’s into older guys doesn’t really surprise you either as most girls her age go through that phase, and given she didn’t really have a good relationship with her parents, she’s probably sub-consciously looking for a father figure.\n\nAbout a month passes and you and Becky get comfortable enough to start having “sex” in a fashion. It’s not exactly the same being cyber and all, but you’ll take a hot naked chick touching herself and typing dirty words to you over nothing. The Shelter is pleased that you are finding a healthy way of releasing your sexual tension, but it really creeps you out that it keeps track of such things.\n\nA few more months pass and it’s obvious to the others what’s been going on between the two of you. Casey thinks its “cool”. You get the impression MissKitty is a bit jealous, but doesn’t really say anything. Job, sensing he missed his chance keeps unsuccessfully directing his attention to MissKitty now, and Shadow actually becomes more talkative in general.\n\nSoon you all learn each others names. Casey’s is Paul, Job is Mark, MissKitty is Miranda and Shadow (who you finally find out is male) is Xavier. Everyone actually sees what each other looks like except for you who continue to refuse to show yourself to anyone, but Becky in private and Xavier who’s a bit hard to see since his lighting is very dim.\n\nIn general things are running smoothly and you and Becky have as close of a relationship as you can over a computer. Even you’re surprised that such a thing is possible.\n\nA year passes...\n\nSuddenly you all get a distressing message from Paul. He says his food and water dispensers have ceased working and he can’t even get his bathroom facilities to work anymore. He says he knows he doesn’t have much time left, so he logged on one last time to tell you all good bye. Xavier states how fucked up that is. Mark naturally freaks out worrying that he’ll be next to suffer total shelter failure. Miranda gives her sympathy and you ask if he has any tools to fix the problem, but he says he didn’t bring any of that kind of stuff with him and there don’t seem to be any tools in his shelter either, at least none that he has access to. This incident gets Becky pretty upset, but more so in private with you. She always liked Paul since he was a cool guy. You do your best to try to comfort her. You however are starting to get paranoid again.\n\nWhile it’s certainly possible Paul’s shelter failed on its own, lord knows these things are supposed to be experimental and his wasn’t working right from the beginning. However, you’re starting to wonder if it’s possible for someone to maliciously hack into the other ones. When you first started all this “meet the neighbors” shit, you were wondering if Xavier was up to no good when he was being all silent in the beginning, but maybe he was sizing you all up and is beginning his strike now though.\n\nPicking you off one by one.\n",
  "page 28": "You stop yourself from imagining conspiracy theories. There doesn’t need to be some mysterious “hacker”. Paul’s shelter was fucked up from day one from what you know. It’s most likely just shoddy GZS workmanship. It’s bad what happened, but there’s no point in stressing over it. You’re just glad you got a good shelter that seems to work properly. Besides your Shelter has a pretty active AI, you’re sure that at the first sign of trouble it would warn you verbally.\n\nYou continue your life as normal with Becky.\n\nAnother year passes...\n\nMark stops logging on for two months which is strange, because he always made an effort to get online whenever possible even when he was in the middle of fixing something. You know he also thought he was “getting somewhere” with Miranda as well.\nEveryone doesn’t say too much about it. While it’s possible he’s just lost network connection and can’t access the rest of you, it’s a given that probably the worst has happened. He was also having shelter problems from day one, so again you chalk it up to GZS fuck ups, after all the Shelter did tell you there were budget cut backs in the construction of these things. Again it’s bad, but there isn’t any point in dwelling over something you can’t do anything about. The world technically ended years ago, all that’s important is that you get what enjoyment you can out of life and that’s what you’re doing with Becky.\n\nLife continues as normal, except you notice the Shelter isn’t as talkative anymore and then ceases speaking to you at all. You don’t think too much about it until a couple months later…\n\nYou wake up to an angry female sounding voice and it’s definitely not the Shelter and it isn’t Becky either.\n\n“Well it took me awhile, but I now have complete access to your systems. Good thing I practiced on Mark and Paul first. You know I didn’t believe you had a talking shelter, but I’m glad you did, it gives me a chance to verbally tell you about how you’re going to die.”\n“Miranda?”\n“Got it one, but then again the choices were pretty limited. Soon after you’re out of the way, Xavier will be next and then it’ll be just me and Becky. She’ll have no choice, but to come to me.”\n\nYou’re so caught off guard that the only reply you can come up with is…“You’re fucking nuts.”\n\n“Maybe, but I’m not going to be dead and that’s the important thing here.”\n“Wait! How about I just break up with Becky? I’ll be a real dick to her, that way there’s no chance she’ll want to get back with me…or better yet how about I just disconnect myself from the network?”\n“Sorry, no. I can’t take that chance. Even if you disconnected from the system what’s stopping you from fixing all the damage I’ve done so far, fortifying and then reconnecting to get revenge on me later? You gotta die, it’s the only way.”\n“Wait! If you do have access to all my systems, how about you just bring the elevator down and let me leave the Shelter? I mean I’d have to go outside, I wouldn’t be able to do anything to you or Becky then, not to mention topside probably isn’t hospitable.”\n“Nice try, but no…for all we know life topside could be paradise now. A few years have passed you know, a lot can happen in that time.”\n“Oh come on, you don’t actually believe that?”\n“Not really, but I just want you to die by my hand…I REALLY don’t like you. You stole Becky away from me and now I’m going to get her back. No more talk, goodbye.”\n“WAIT!”\n\nAll power shuts down in your Shelter leaving you in complete darkness. You fumble around and head towards where your food and water dispensers are and predictably they don’t work. You’re left to the same agonizing fate that Mark and Paul were. Oddly you don’t panic as much as you might think in the face of imminent death. In some ways you had a good run after the world ended. You cheated death for a longer time than most folks did and you got to spend time with a pretty girl at least during most of it. Again, no point in worrying about shit you can’t do anything about. Kind of wish you got to say goodbye to Becky, but you can’t have everything.\n\nYou do have one advantage that Mark and Paul didn’t though; you can still choose when to die. You feel around in the darkness back to your bedroom and go into the bag you brought with you when you first got here.\n\nThere it is; your pistol.\n\nYou position it to your head…\n",
  "page 27": "Shadow might be fooling the others, but you know he (or she) is up to no good! The next time you’re online and see Shadow you access the private feature to request to talk to Shadow directly without the others interfering. You almost expect Shadow to ignore it, but he doesn’t and accepts your request.\n\nShadow21: Yeah, so what do you want and why the need for all the secrecy?\nOmegaMan23: I might ask you the same thing. I mean why are you even bothering to come online if you aren’t going to speak to anyone?\nShadow21: What business is it of yours what I do?\nOmegaMan23: Because it’s been like six months and we still don’t know shit about you! Hell we don’t even know if you’re a girl or a guy! You’re acting fucking suspicious.\nShadow21: Oh excuse me for being private Mr. fuckin’ busybody! Maybe you and the rest like telling all your business, but I don’t…as a matter of fact YOU haven’t really told anything about yourself either, so you don’t have any room to talk motherfucker!\nOmegaMan23: What the hell are you talking about? Your brain as dim as your lighting over there? I’ve talked about myself plenty, shit you’ve been lurking enough you should’ve known that.\nShadow21: Ehhh, no not like the others. You tend to still talk about superficial shit. The others talk about their pasts a lot more, while all you seem to do is try to figure out what’s going on in all of their shelters, like you’re taking notes on them or something. Seems to me YOU’RE the one acting suspicious and you’re just getting mad because I’m not volunteering information.\nOmegaMan23: Oh fuck no! You are not turning this shit around on me! I’m at least TRYING to be social; all you’re doing is fucking spying as far as I’m concerned. You’re up to something.\nShadow21: Okay, I think MissKitty was right about you a few months back, you’ve gone fucking batty from the isolation and paranoia’s starting to set in. Shit, you claim the Shelter talks to you.\nOmegaMan23: It DOES talk to me! And what isolation? I’ve been talking to ALL of you fuckers! In fact couple that with talking with the shelter and I’m probably the most social of all of you!\nShadow21: Yeah, you can also add the five other personalities you probably got in your head too, whatever nutjob. I’m done talking with you.\nOmegaMan23: Don’t you fucking log off, this isn’t over!\n\nYou slam your fist down on the keyboard when you see that Shadow has indeed logged off.\n\n“Sir, are you okay?” the Shelter asks.\n“Yeah, but I know that Shadow motherfucker is up to something, I’m going to warn the others. I just can’t believe they don’t see it.”\n“Do you really believe that sir?”\n“Of course I do! I mean I got an instinct for this sort of thing, and I know I’m right!”\n“Well sir, if you do feel this way I’ll certainly accommodate you anyway I can…but might I suggest that you NOT tell the others?”\n“Why not?”\n“Because they aren’t going to believe you sir. You’ll just come off as a paranoid nut case.”\n“But I’m not!”\n“I know you’re not, but the others don’t know you the way I do sir.”\n“Well that might be, but I have to do it anyway. At least I will have warned them.”\n“You know best sir.”\n\nThe next day you go online again, as usual everyone’s there, except Shadow. It seems your little talk yesterday has scared him off.\n\nJob24: And now I got water all over the fucking floor! I’m telling you, it’s a good thing I managed to shut it off when I did otherwise the entire shelter would’ve been flooded and I would’ve drowned!\nCaseyJones22: Oh come on, it probably wasn’t that bad. You need to relax.\nJob24: Easy for you to say pothead, you’re not the one living in a deathtrap!\nMissKitty25: Yeah, but then most of his Shelter hasn’t opened up. Has it?\nCaseyJones22: Nah. Doesn’t bother me though, I got what I need here.\nRockerChickl20: Hey guys, don’t you want to see each other yet? I’m really curious, but I don’t want to turn on my camera unless everyone else is going to do it!\nOmegaMan23: I wouldn’t do that, you don’t want to be giving Shadow any extra information by letting him see into your Shelters, who knows what the hell what he’ll do with it.\nRockerChick20: What do you mean?\nOmegaMan23: What I mean is, I had an interesting discussion with Shadow yesterday and I’ve determined he’s up to no good.\nJob24: What? How do you know this?\nOmegaMan23: Jesus Christ isn’t it fucking obvious? All he does is lurk on here trying to gather information on all of us! I mean who knows what the fuck he’s doing!\nCaseyJones22: Will you relax? Maybe the dude’s just shy. What could he do with our personal information anyway? I mean, I once accidentally fucked a transvestite while flying on XTC one time. Big fuckin’ whoop so everyone knows about it now. You think I give a shit? The old world’s dead, and I’m down here smokin’ and tokin’.\nJob24: Ew. I think you still should’ve kept that to yourself…so um what was it like?\nCaseyJones22: I dunno, I can’t remember the details.\nOmegaMan23: I’m not talking about your sorted sex lives…(sigh) for fuck’s sake did it ever occur to you that maybe he’s the fucking cause of your Shelter’s troubles? I mean we’re all connected to each other to a certain degree, I’m saying he might be hacking shit!\nRockerChick20: But for what purpose? I mean why?\nOmegaMan23: How the hell should I know? Because he’s a sociopath that’s why! What reason do most bad people do to do bad things?\nJob24: Oh man! Oh man! Oh shit! Oh God! Oh fuck!\nCaseyJones22: You’re fucking losing it dude, and I’m not talking about Job. There’s no proof in what you’re saying. I mean don’t remember GZS saying these things were slightly experimental, how do you know it just isn’t their fuck ups? I’m starting to wonder if you actually do have a “talking Shelter” and it’s not just some voice you’re hearing your head like MissKitty said a few months back.\nMissKitty25: You know I wasn’t going to say anything, but I also spoke to Shadow yesterday in private when he requested to talk to me and he was telling me about your conversation with him, saying you were ranting at him first, kind of like how you’re ranting now. I’d have to say I agree with him and you’re the crazy one.\nOmegaMan23: GODDAMN IT! The question of whether I’m crazy or not isn’t the fucking issue here! I’m trying to warn all you fucktards of a potential threat here and you’re all too fucking stupid to listen!\nRockerChick20: You know I thought you were an interesting guy, but now I see the rest are right about you, you are a paranoid nutjob and to think I defended you sometimes.\nOmegaMan23: What the…oh you fuckers have been talking about me behind my back? Okay fine, I tried to warn you assholes, but you didn’t want to listen. You think about that when one of YOUR Shelter’s start fucking up. And for the others who are already experiencing problems, I’d start saying your prayers, because one of these days your Shelter is going to fail completely, then you’ll see I’m right. I’m done with all of you.\n\nYou log off abruptly and ponder your next move.\n",
  "page 20": "Maybe it’s because you’ve gotten so used to the idea of being in the living area, you’re more willing to lounge about there. You take the manual and start reading. While you’re in the middle of it, the voice suddenly pipes up again.\n\n“Sorry to bother your reading sir, but would you like to meet some of your new neighbors?”\n“Neighbors?”\n”Yes sir, I’m sure as you have already read, this shelter is equipped with a very high tech computer with loads of storage, information and…”\n”Yeah, yeah, what does that have to do with this neighbor business?”\n“In an effort to cater to all its customer’s needs, GZS is well aware that socialization is vital to human mental health. Studies have shown that humans in long periods of isolation often go mad, so that is why this facility has been linked in communication to other ones within your area. You might think of it as a chatroom type form of communication commonly used on the old world internet! If you wish there is also a camera type device if you wish to show yourself to your new neighbors. We have found humans feel someone is more real to them if they can actually see who they are talking to and thus have a greater connection.”\n“So how many people are there?”\n“This shelter merely has been fitted with a basic communication system to other similar shelters, and only then those in your area. For example this is Shelter number 23. Your neighbors are only numbers 20 through 25, those being the closest ones to your location. While obviously there were other shelters of this type built, it was not cost effective to link all the shelters together in such a manner given our timeframe to finish these before Armageddon, so only a few were linked together at a time. Do not worry sir; it has been found that six people are sufficient to sustain enough conversation to prevent mental failure due to isolation.”\n“Wonderful, so does this make me the Professor?” you ask rhetorically.\n“Pardon sir?”\n“Nevermind, look I don’t have to talk to these people do I?”\n“…well no sir, but I fail to see why you’d intentionally want to stay isolated.”\n“Duh, that was kind of the point of buying a shelter for myself.”\n“…I see, well I can’t force you sir, but I would like you to reconsider…I’m just trying to look out for your physical as well as mental welfare as per my programming…”\n\nIf you didn’t know better the voice almost sounds a bit hurt by your decision.\n\n“Oh alright, I’ll go talk to them. Can’t be any worse than the idiots I used argue with on the internet.”\n“Wonderful sir! I trust you know your way to the computer room. You will find that a designation name has already been chosen for you.”\n\nYou make your way to the computer room and take a better look at it this time. It’s filled with lots of multi-media entertainment. You’re glad they gave you a wide variety of movies to chose from. You sit down in front of a fairly wide computer screen which has already been turned on for you; you guess the Shelter is really keen on the idea of you being social. You don’t turn the camera on though, in fact you turn it away from you completely, you’re not quite ready for THAT level of socialization yet.\n\nYou log on and begin typing.\n\n\nOmegaMan23: Hello? Is there anyone out there?\nRockerChick20: Hey! I’m here!\nOmegaMan23: Oh. Okay. Hi.\nRockerChick20: Hi yourself! This is just like a chatroom! Isn’t this great?\nOmegaMan23: Uh yeah real great.\nJob24: Hey I’m here too; um do you guys have any movies or something?\nOmegaMan23: Yeah I got a shitload of movies, DVDs and VHS. Most of them I even like.\nRockerChick20: That’s weird, I don’t have too many movies, I have a lot of music CDs though.\nJob24: What kind of music?\nRockerChick20: All types, but I have a lot of them. Why?\nJob24: I don’t have any movies except those with Pauly Shore in them! He fucking sucks! And all my music CDs are New Age Yanni type shit! Thank god I have some games to play!\nOmegaMan23:  I’ve got some games too, but for some reason I have nothing but Gangsta Rap and Hair Metal as far as music goes oh wait I also have some Classical. Weird. What the hell I thought these Shelters were all stocked the same?\nMissKitty25: Apparently not, I have nothing but porno and not all of it is regular porno either, some of it is quite…bizarre.\nJob24: Lucky.\nCaseyJones22: Hey guys when do the Shelters become fully functional?\nOmegaMan23: What the hell are you talking about?\nCaseyJones22: I mean when do the rest of the doors to the place open up, besides the bathroom I mean.\nRockerChick20: What do you mean? The doors were all open to begin with.\nJob24: Yeah they were always open.\nMissKitty25: Yeah.\nOmegaMan23: They weren’t open for me! I was stuck in the living area until the nukes hit! Wait a minute how are you using the computer if you’re stuck in the living area? In fact if the doors were all open for you guys haven’t you been in contact with each other before?\nJob24: My computer didn’t link up to you guys until just now. I could use it to play games and such, but I couldn’t do anything else with it. When I turned it on today I got a message saying that the communications to you guys was operational and it said I could take the opportunity to say hi to my five new neighbors.\nRockerChick20: Sounds like what happened to me.\nMissKitty25: Same here.\nCaseyJones22: Me too. Oh and you guys must have different shelter designs because my computer is in the living area.\nOmegaMan23: The Shelter never told me anything about this stuff and it’s been quite talkative since I’ve been here let me tell you.\nCaseyJones22: The Shelter talks? Now what the hell are you talking about?\nOmegaMan23: I’m talking about the Shelter, you know the overly chipper voice that tries so hard to please you?\nCaseyJones22: You’ve lost me dude. You been smokin’?\nOmegaMan23: NO! I’m talking about the Shelter voice! It’s a computer or something that talks to me! It’s always trying to be friendly! Don’t you guys hear it?\nRockerChick20: Um, no.\nJob24: No talking computer here.\nMissKitty25: You sure you’re feeling okay and aren’t imagining things? I mean we all were isolated for a long time before we were able to talk to one another. I know sometimes I would talk to myself, maybe…\nOmegaMan23: Look, I’m not fucking crazy alright?! The damn thing even insisted that I talk to you fuckers!\nCaseyJones22: Okay dude calm down we believe you! Maybe you got some sort of extra special shelter; I mean from the sound of it we all don’t have the same things.\nRockerChick20: Hey shouldn’t there be one more person here? The message said five new neighbors on my computer; so far I’ve only met four of you guys.\nOmegaMan23: Yeah we’re missing number 21, whatever his or her name is.\nShadow21: I’m right here; I’ve just been reading the conversation.\nOmegaMan23: Oh really? Well you mind announcing your presence next time?\nShadow21: I only speak when necessary, besides if any of you bothered to check you would’ve seen my name listed on the active list.\nJob24: Hey what kind of movies do you have?\n\nWell you’ve met your neighbors, the question is if you want to bother talking to them on a regular basis or not. You did find their information interesting though.\n",
  "page 200": "Knowing Alex, he’s probably killed his assistants too; you go in with your weapon ready.\n\n\n“FUCK! Goddamn GZS equipment! Always fucks up!” Alex says as he’s trying to install some sort of implant in the head of some corpse on a table. Its one of his assistants and his brains are leaking all over the place, you don’t even know what the hell Alex was trying to accomplish, and you get the impression he doesn’t either. He stares at you with eyes telling you he’s finally gone over the edge for good this time.\n\n“You see? You see what I have to work with? Can’t fucking work under these conditions! Not enough equipment! Plenty of bodies, just need the equipment…is it lunch time?”\n“Is that why you infected Ashtown? So you could rebuild your insane dreams of cyborgs again?”\n“It’s not insane! Its evolution! You really think the Atomic Alliance can last in its current form? NO! It NEEDS to be remade! Y’see I tried…I really did…I really tried to delude myself into thinking civilization can be rebuilt and survive in its current form…but it wasn’t until I came here and found this diary…this Elliot guy…had lots of good ideas about the nature of man…and how control IS the only way to maintain order…of course he obviously failed when his so called “obedience serum” had a long term detrimental health effect on the inhabitants here. Comes in handy as a virulent toxin when altered a bit and dumped into a water supply though. Strange how it doesn’t affect pre-pubescent children.”\n“You fuckin’ sonofabitch…” you say pointing your rifle at him, he doesn’t even seem to notice, he just keeps talking.\n\n“His ideas were sound, just his method was flawed, and it made me realize I was right in the beginning, I was just prevented from seeing my plan come to fruition due to YOUR own ambition and meddling! Shit, you can barely keep the Alliance leaders to agree on anything! The only reason why they follow you is because of the polite threat of superior firepower that you have access to and the major food source you have under your direct control in Eden. If that advantage ever disappeared, you’d have another civil war on your hands. You’re petty dictator hiding in democracy. Your own method of control is as clumsy as Elliot’s.”\n“I’m not controlling anyone, you psychotic fuck!”\n“Bullshit! You’ve built your whole career on it! Your destruction of my plans, your war with the Combine, creating the Atomic Alliance and being the head of it. You really expect me to believe you did all this without ambition?”\n“Actually yeah. Had it not been for Marina’s influence, I probably wouldn’t have bothered…”\n“How long are you going to hide behind THAT ghost? Perhaps she did have influence on you in the beginning as far as motivation was concerned, but nobody, NOBODY that has gotten this far can say they’ve been doing this all this as some sort of monument for the love of a dead woman! You’re lying to yourself because YOU don’t have the fuckin’ balls to admit you’re a goddamn friendly fascist! And after you’re dead? Do you think the Atomic Alliance will really live on? I predict it falls apart and in fighting occurs within a month! Humans are incapable of ruling themselves! The LAST WAR PROVED THAT! The Cybernetic Evolution is the ONLY thing that makes sense!”\n\nYou think about some of the things Alex’s insane ranting, before responding.\n\n“…you might be right Alex. You might be right, but there’s just one thing...”\n“Oh what’s that?”\n“Your method sucks too, mainly because you were too idiotic to ever get it off the ground in the first place and this isn’t for Marina, its for my daughter Laura you fucking mass murdering motherfucker.”\n\nYou riddle Alex’s body with bullets until he’s such a bloody heap that he’s actually ripped in half by your burst. You then pull out your pistol and blast his face into a red pulpy mess.\n\nIts over.\n\nYou return to Base Pandora where Vivica has been trying to keep control of things as everyone is starting to wonder what’s going on exactly. You give a full report to the entire Atomic Alliance about what happened. It’s a big event that nearly shatters the Alliance. When you think about it, maybe that was Alex’s “back up plan”, as even if he had been killed, he must’ve known you’d catch heat for what happened.\n\nSome say it really wasn’t your fault, others say it was, since you left an unstable element like Alex to his own devices. Some say your past deeds should be taken into consideration, others say it doesn’t make up for the death of an entire town. Some say you tried to make things right, others say you shouldn’t be applauded for attempting to fix something that was your fault in the first place. Still others say it wasn’t your fault to begin with since the opening of the Shelters was most of the OTHER town leader’s idea not yours. It’s apparent everyone is divided on the situation, so you do the only thing that makes sense and step down from being the head of the Atomic Alliance.\n\nThis has more of an effect than you hoped. Some people still think you should be punished directly, but for the most part most are just satisfied that you aren’t the head of the Alliance anymore. The ones closest to you think it’s unfair, but you don’t really care. You probably saved the Alliance again with your actions, another civil war would’ve occurred otherwise. You can only hope in time people will see that.\n\nVivica becomes the new head of the Alliance. Some object to her as well since she’s somewhat close to you, but most accept her since her reputation is pretty spotless and fair minded. You remain in control of Base Pandora, which now mainly concentrates on strictly military matters as in defending the AA borders. Less politics, but not less responsibility since you now have a daughter to take care of…\n\nTen more years pass…\n\nTwenty years have passed since the bombs dropped, and the Atomic Alliance is the largest known stretch of civilization known in the immediate area. It’s now become an official democratic political entity rather than just a collection of separate towns and forts which were merely aligned. Vivica is now officially the President.\n\nGZS Shelters have been converted into major the supplier of water. Gone are the days of wondering if water was safe to drink. These Shelters have also been modified to have surrounding land to become agricultural centers like Eden; the water is piped in from underground to help grow crops. They’re probably more useful than what they were initially intended for.\n\nAshtown was repopulated, but a big memorial is now standing there in memory of the dead, the Shelter near Ashtown was destroyed. Explosives were placed in the entryway such a manner that it imploded in on itself forever burying the place.\n\nAs for you, you find less and less to do each day at Base Pandora. While it’s foolish to think that the world is now a safe place that an Atomic Alliance military isn’t needed, it’s just that it has fewer threats. Raiders might lurk on the outskirts of it, but to actually attack it now would be folly. Only the craziest and most desperate raiders do that nowadays, and they’re usually easily dispatched by the AA Police Force. (Most of course having trained at Base Pandora combat academy) Civil unrest mainly consists of a few normal complaints, never anything like what happened in the past. It almost like the “Old World” again.\n\nYou however are glad of this, since you have enough trouble trying to look after your daughter Laura. She’s quite willful now that’s she’s a teenager, but fortunately your relationship isn’t really bad though, you just never did get a hang of this whole father thing. The best thing you did was train her to take care of herself. Though now you’re wondering if that was such a good idea.\n\n“I want to join the Atomic Alliance City Project!” she says.\n\nHaving tamed most of the surrounding area, the next big agenda for the Alliance is to restore the City. You never really thought this was the best idea Vivica had, since the City has always been considered a very dangerous place, with nothing but deadly radiation levels and mutant monstrosities. In fact you turned down the option to head up the project when she proposed it to you. You remember way back in your early days of the Compound, when a few people were sent to the City, and only one returned speaking of the horrible creatures inside. Since then, nobody ever really went there. Every now and then you heard about a few hostile mutants wandering from the city, but it was rare, it seems as if they were content on living in their own area.\n\nYou lived on “your side” and they lived on “their side” and that’s the way it should stay. Seems like fucking around with the City might be inviting trouble, sort of like when you decided to fuck around the Shelters ten years ago…\n\nYour daughter on the other hand like most youthful sorts, sees “adventure”. True she’s not some delicate flower and she grew up relatively fast (She did see her mother die in front of her along with the rest of the town) but its not like she’s had any real combat experience, plus she’s only fifteen and you do feel the need to protect her.\n",
  "page 201": "You figure Alex is occupied, so you can check to make sure he doesn’t have one of his assistants skulking about. You’d hate to confront him only to get shot in the back by one of them.\n\nUnfortunately that’s exactly what happens anyway. While you search for other enemies, Alex hears and sneaks up on you, shooting you in the back. You drop to the floor gasping for air.\n\n“I always said you’d make an excellent candidate for remaking…trust me, I’m saving the Alliance, by doing this…” are the last words you hear by Alex before you fall unconscious and never wake up.\n",
  "page 204": "If your daughter’s going to insist on this foolishness, you’re going to make sure you’re at least observing her. You travel to New Justice (Formally called Fort Justice) to see Vivica. Lately you and Vivica haven’t been agreeing on too much about this, so you end up storming into her office and demanding the position.\n\n“Vivica! I want that City Project job, I don’t give a shit who you’ve already applied the position to already, I’m fuckin’ taking it!”\n“Sure. You got it. Anything else?” Vivica says not looking up from her writing some document.\n“…uh no? You don’t mind?”\n“Why would I? I asked you to take this position in the first place.”\n“Yeah I know, but I was sort of an asshole about turning it down before.”\n“Well I figured you’d come around, even if you don’t agree with this project.”\n“I still don’t…I mean don’t you think we’ll be doing more harm than good by fucking around with the City? I mean the mutants inside don’t normally come out, if we start going in, we might be stirring up a bee’s nest.”\n\nVivica stop writing and looks at you.\n\n“Let me ask you something…didn’t you stir up a bee’s nest when you first confronted Alex at Base Pandora twenty years ago? Think about it. Had you not gone in, isn’t it possible that he would’ve actually built up a large enough army of cyborgs and robots to attack us later and we wouldn’t have been able to defend against?”\n“Well MAYBE, but…”\n“How about when we fought those cultists at Eden? Your actions saved a woman who you would later give birth to your daughter. Not to mention that once run down farm house became a great agricultural center that is still a big supplier of AA food today. Not to mention Biofuel.”\n“Yeah, but…”\n“How about standing up to Harry and the Combine? I’m sure you could’ve easily run away from the situation, but you didn’t.”\n“Well I stayed because of Marina.”\n“True, but you also stay because deep down you KNEW that the Combine was corrupt and evil and needed to be destroyed and yes the loss was great, to you especially. But look what happened, the Atomic Alliance was created, and is still the closest thing to civilization in this little part of this fucked up world, well that we know of anyway.”\n“I guess, but…”\n“What about the opening of the Shelters? Now I know that’s a sore point with you. I know some people blame you for what happened due to that bastard Alex’s treachery. I know you probably still blame yourself to a certain degree, but think about it we use most of those Shelters as the major suppliers of food and water now. I don’t even think Atomic Alliance would be as prosperous as it is today without them. You’ve done more for the Atomic Alliance than anyone. Marina always said you never gave yourself a lot of credit for what you were capable of, it’s one of the reasons why she always felt the need to push you a bit.”\n“Okay, but…”\n“And you want to know why I wanted you to head this project? Because you’re the only one capable of pulling it off. Seriously if anything this shitty new world has taught us is we can’t just leave things alone. We have to take a pro-active approach to things just like we always have. I mean sure the mutants aren’t leaving the city NOW, but who knows what the hell the future holds? Shouldn’t we find out if those muties are forming their own army rather than finding out about it when it’s crossing our borders? Shouldn’t we find out if they aren’t ALL insane freaks and perhaps some of them are even civilized enough to make friends with? You’ve dealt with situations like this so many times that you’re about the only expert on the matter; you always seem to have made the decisions that turned out for the best in the long run. Maybe you aren’t running the Alliance, but you ARE the fuckin’ founder. So while perhaps you’re only taking this position to keep an eye on your daughter, you’ll eventually realize that you’re doing the right thing anyway, just like you always have.”\n“…how’d you know that’s why I was doing this?” you ask totally surprised.\n“Because a few weeks ago Laura snuck into my office begging me to let her join and I told her she better clear it with you. I figured your reaction would’ve been telling her no, or you would’ve let her only to demand to be head of the project to keep an eye on her. Glad it was the latter.” She says with a grin.\n\nSo it happens, you take control of the Project. You organize and plan and all the rest that goes along with it. A relatively large force made up of the best Pandora’s combat academy has to offer make a trip to the City. The radiation levels aren’t quite as high as expected, but everyone is still expected to wear their radiation suits. While you aren’t worried about yourself, you are sort of worried about Laura. Even if the mutants aren’t a problem, the higher radiation levels could render her sterile. You never thought about it before, but you would like to have grand-children someday…but if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen. No more regrets or wondering about what could be done differently. You’ve done enough of that in the past, and Vivica was right, you don’t give yourself enough credit for your accomplishments.\n\nYou personally go on every patrol Laura does. It embarrasses her a bit, that you’re being so over protective, but she appreciates it later when a gang of hungry mutants attack. (Though some snickering is heard later from some of the others in the squad when you help her up, and she has to endure a few taunts of being “Daddy’s little girl”, but she soon proves to be able capable in combat which makes you proud)\n\nAfter a few weeks of exploration, you find that there’s a whole little world going on in the city. There are more factions here than you’ve ever come across! Some mutants are just mindless cannibals roaming the streets, while others are more organized and vicious. Still others follow weird new religions (Never friendly types in your experience) and others are actually friendly and have collected, fixed and horded lots of equipment over the years and would be willing to trade with “pretties” such as yourselves. (You don’t like the way they look at Laura though even if she is in a radiation suit)\n\nOddly new mutants are being born, not a lot, but a few. Seeing as they’re going to be a factor in years to come you guess it would be best to make alliances with the friendly mutants and provide them with help…this of course comes in the form of firepower. Of course you aren’t so idiotic to start giving them rocket launchers and such, but ammunition and few extra rifles to your new mutant “friends” can’t hurt the balance of power in the city since you don’t see it as it ever being fully part of the Alliance. You think it’ll always be known as Zeropolis (As the mutants call it) where the mutants live and chaos will always be a way of life where only the fittest survive. Hmmm, just like before the bombs hit actually…\n\nOne other good thing about this experience is after her first tour in Zeropolis, Laura decides to pursue a slightly safer career as a member of the Atomic Alliance Police Force. You’re beyond relieved.\n\nThirty years pass…\n\nFifty years have passed and you’re now celebrating the forty fifth anniversary of the founding of the Atomic Alliance at its capital of New Justice, of course you and Ex-President Vivica are about the only ones still alive who were around from the VERY beginning when it was only just “The Compound”.\n\nYou personally are receiving some sort of honor for all your deeds in making the AA possible. You even get a statue and while you’re publicly humble about it, you do secretly really like it. After all you do deserve the recognition, and you’re finally being given your credit. After you and Vivica give your speeches and get off stage, Laura hugs you and says how happy she is for you. Your grandson David does as well. You were always happy Laura’s fertility wasn’t affected by the trip to Zeropolis. Though David’s six fingers on each hand display some of the effects, but he’s normal in every other way. (If anything he may make a great diplomat to the mutants when he grows up!)\n\nAfter the grand night of celebration, you go back home to rest. You’re really tired. Like you feel like you could sleep forever.\n\nSometimes it weird to think that before the bombs hit, you were never really a social person, but then afterwards, you became a warrior, a diplomat and a founder of a new civilization leading people through it all.\n\n“I guess you were right Marina…I always did have it in me…” you say as you drift off to sleep…\n",
  "page 203": "She’s still fifteen; you’re still able to restrict her from doing whatever the hell she wants. You do however realize that too much restriction isn’t going to help and possibly even drive her away, so what you propose is a compromise and you allow her to go on border patrol mission and minor recon duty.\n\nLet her deal with some raiders and see if she still wants to pursue this life of adventure…\n\nShe isn’t exactly enthusiastic about this idea, probably because it doesn’t seem as “exciting”. Most raiders go running at the first sign of trouble, so there’s actually little in the way of combat. She starts becoming a little more daring and patrols further than she’s supposed to. You tell others to keep an eye on her, but of course that’s impossible all the time.\n\nThen your worst fears come true. Laura is ambushed, beaten and gang raped. She would’ve probably been killed, but the rest of the recon team arrived in time to drive them off. They managed to kill a few…but not all. You’ve suffered a lot of tragedies in your life, but this one has got to be the worst since you lost Marina…worse even. You don’t sink into depression though, you fly into a rage. You immediately gather your best men and personally hunt the rest of these scumfucks down.\n\nThere is no where they can hide; you are the embodiment of vengeance. As is typical you find them hold up in a cave where you catch most of them off guard, as ordered, your men don’t shoot to kill, they shoot to maim. You’ll be the one doing the killing.\n\nYou cut off the genitals of each one of them and stuff them into their mouths. You yell and scream at them as you repeatedly shoot and kick their bloody bodies. You don’t stop tormenting them even after death until one of your men finally tells you stop.\n\nYou don’t really feel any better though, once again you feel like you’ve failed, just like you did ten years ago with Alex killing most of Ashtown. You can’t do this anymore; you resign your command at Pandora, despite Vivica not wanting you to.\n\nIt takes Laura awhile to get over the traumatic event, and she never really does. She picks a safer career path and she never marries or even dates, despite you telling her that she should and that its okay, but she says she’s satisfied just living with you. (And while you blamed yourself for what happened, she never did) And while you don’t mind her company, this also saddens you.\n\nIn your remaining years, you spend a lot of time regretting a lot of decisions you made in the past. You can’t even take “pride” in the fact that you contributed greatly to rebuilding civilization. When yet another war breaks out with the mutants due to the Atomic Alliance City Project you just shake your head wondering if it was all worth it to begin with.\n\nEventually when you die, it’s sort of a release for you. A small respectful funeral is held for you as you’re buried next to Marina like you always wanted to be, but as time goes on after Vivica and those who were with you from the beginning in the Compound die off, your name and deeds are forgotten completely as what happens to most “heroes” of history.\n",
  "page 206": "100 years later…\n\nAnother night at a small bar in New Justice, Sirus was telling another tale of his latest mission.\n\n“…and so I said to those mutants: Yeah, but after you eat me, who’s gonna stop the GZS lawyers from coming here?” Sirus says while the rest of the bar patrons laughed, of course as always there’s ONE person that has to be a dickhead.\n“Hey Sirus, I wouldn’t insult your fellow mutants so much seeing as you’re one of them, having six fingers on each hand and all.”\n\nSirus didn’t take offense, he’d heard it all before and after his many trips to Zeropolis, he certainly wasn’t afraid of some drunk.\n\n“Ah yes, my six fingers…and might I say your wife is very appreciative of them when I touch her in that special way that makes her call out in ecstasy…”\n“YOU FUCKING MUTIE BASTARD!” the drunk shouted and clumsily attacked Sirus who nimbly dodged and back kicked him in the head dropping him.\n\n“Ha ha! Let him sleep it off and put his bill on my tab! All of you are my friends tonight! Drinks for everyone!” Sirus said while the entire bar applauded this act of generosity.\n\n“Hey Sirus, you’re like a big time Atomic Alliance agent and shit, how come you hang out in places like this?” another patron asked\n“Well given that most of my assignments are in Zeropolis, I feel more at home here! Ha ha! No, but seriously I just never was one to associate with the higher class, I much prefer to tell my stories to you folks where it’s appreciated.”\n“Hmm, sounds like they probably just got sick of hearing you brag.”\n“Quite observant! Give this man another drink!”\n“Hey brag all you like, just as long as you’re buying!”\n“Yes, I have a lot to brag about I suppose, but I’ll never be able to top my Great-great-great-grandpa. Now there was a great man. He accomplished so much, and he did it all without any type of innate radiation protection or six fingers on each hand! From what I heard though despite all his accomplishments, he was always a humble and reserved sort. Very serious minded.”\n“Hmm, you sure you’re related?”\n“Wondered that myself sometimes, but when I look at that statue, the resemblance is uncanny, well except for the six fingers of course. In some ways I like to think I’m so jovial because he couldn’t be. Things were a lot worse back then, I’m sure there was less time for bragging and carousing.”\n\nThe bar gets silent as Sirus reflected on his ancestor. A sense of great respect welled up inside him as he thought about the statue of you in front of the capitol building. He prevented himself from displaying too much emotion in front of these bar patrons, but it was there as it always would be. Soon he began talking again like his old self, but bragging about a different person.\n\n“You know what that’s enough about me for tonight, how about I tell a story about him that’s less well known in the history books; in fact my Grandmother told me if it hadn’t been for this event, I would not be here today to grace you all with my presence! Now this happened about a hundred and fifty years ago, give or take a year. My ancestor was scouting with his squad and they came upon an old farmhouse…”\n",
  "page 208": "You might be absorbing more rads than usual now, but heading to the city would just be retarded. You’d probably die of cancer just going near the place; everything there would be contaminated anyway. You don’t even want to see the survivors what the survivors might look like assuming there were any. You head for the general store, that’s at least a safer bet.\n\nYou drive your Van to the general store not very far from your house. You remember the old guy who ran the place; Billy. He was always alright with you. Whenever you went in to buy food, he was always talking about how bad the state of world was getting and how he was going to be  prepared for when the nukes started flying. You’re guessing he probably invested in one of those Ground Zero Survival Shelters you always saw for sale on TV and took himself and his wife to it. The last time you saw the place it was all boarded up and looked closed up for good, still it’s a start.\n\nYou arrive at the store which is still all boarded up like the last time you’ve seen it. You always found it weird that Billy bothered to board the place up, if he was going to abandon it. Surely he couldn’t have thought things would be restored so quickly after a nuclear exchange that he’d be able to return some day.\n\nYou get out of your van and study the store more closely which you never bothered to do before, the windows are boarded up from the outside, but upon closer inspection the door hasn’t been boarded up at all. You try the door, but it’s firmly locked. Nothing else for it, but to bash it down. You begin prying, slamming, kicking and everything else to the door, but its not budging and you only succeed in bruising your shoulder. In frustration you pull out your pistol and finally just shoot at the lock and then try to open it, which it does slightly, something else is barring the door from the inside though. You’re going to have to start ramming the thing again to shove it open enough to get inside.\n\nSuddenly you hear some noise from inside and the click of a shotgun, it’s also only just then you realize that Billy’s pick up truck is still parked by the side of his store. He’s obviously still here and you were oblivious to the fact.\n\n“Goddamn it Martha, hasn’t been a month yet an’ we already got scum tryin’ ta loot the place!”\n\nIt’s Billy. You thought he left, but apparently not. He just made it look like he did and barricaded himself inside.\n\n“Alright you looting shit stain, you better just get the fuck outta here right now, ‘fore you find yourself with a new hole in your chest!” Billy says from inside.\n“Whoa Billy it’s me! I used to shop here! Come on open up, I’m not a looter!” you reply.\n“…(sigh) hold on, and back away from the goddamn door.”\n\nYou back away as Billy presumably moves whatever was still blocking the door. When he finally opens it up, he stands in the doorway still pointing his shotgun at you.\n\n“Damnation boy, I coulda blown your head off! You fuckin’ destroyed my lock! What the hell are you wearin’?” Billy asks looking at your silly form of protection.\n“I’m sorry; I thought you abandoned this place.”\n“Oh and that gave you the excuse to break in? What’re you think yer doin’ anyway? Why aren’t you in your shelter or something?”\n“Cause I don’t have one that’s why! I was going to see if this place had any supplies and maybe stay here, if it wasn’t in bad condition.”\n“Oh. Well, sorry to crush yer dreams, but this place is still occupied and OWNED by me. You’re gonna have to skedaddle. Just enough supplies for me and my wife.”\n“But…”\n“No buts! Now you were a good customer an’ all, but this is a new world and the rules have severely changed! It’s all about survival now. And it’s not my fault your ass didn’t prepare for somethin’ that was comin’ for a long time! Now if you don’t leave now I’m gonna be less understanding about this lack of judgment on your part. Bye and good luck.”\n“No wait!”\n\nAt this point Billy slams the door shut mumbling about the lock being destroyed and going to have to fix it. Billy must have some sort of private bomb shelter of his own, if he barricaded himself inside his own store. One that must be stocked pretty well to sustain him and his wife for a good amount of time.\n\nAn idea races through your head that you never thought you’d consider, well not before the nukes hit anyway, but Billy’s statement of “This is about survival” rings true. It IS about survival, and not just his.\n\nYou don’t really want to do this, but you feel like you have no other choice.\n\nBilly is still trying to barricade the door, when you take another forceful charge into it.  \nYour attempt is successful this time as it flies open causing Billy to fall and drop the heavy box he was going to place in front of it. The box half lands on Billy causing him crushing pain while he struggles to grab his shotgun from the floor. You’re quicker though and point your own pistol at him.\n\n“Don’t grab that shotgun Billy…I don’t want to kill you.” you say\n“Goddamn sonofabitch, you ain’t taking this…”\n“Billy what’s… OH MY GOD!”\n\nWhen you hear Martha’s outburst, it startles you during this already tense moment, you end up turning around and firing. You hit Martha square in the chest; she looks down briefly in shock before falling over dead. You’re a little in shock yourself.\n\n“MARTHA!” Billy screams, causing you to face him once more, he’s now actually grabbed the shotgun, and you begin babbling.\n\n“Oh God! Oh man! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! She came up and…Billy don’t do that…I don’t want to…please…”\n\nYou fire again, hitting Billy in the head, splattering his brains all over the floor and killing him instantly.\n\nYou feel sick and promptly run outside to vomit. You’ve never killed anyone before, though you don’t think it was that, that made you sick. It was the fact you murdered two people who were really innocent. You were the trespasser and when you couldn’t get what you wanted, you took it by force. You acted like a criminal even if there’s no such thing as “law” anymore. You sit down in a daze for a few minute trying to take all this in, before realizing you have to take care of some clean up first.\n\nYou remove the bodies of Billy and Martha from the store. (You also remove your silly “protection wear”, well except the dishwashing gloves for moving the bodies) You wonder where you’re going put them, but eventually you decide to just dump them in the wilderness nearby, you figure nature will take its course.\n\nYou go back to the store and re-barricade it. The store itself is empty, but in a back room, you discover a trapdoor. You descend and discover a large shelter with a treasure of food and water supplies, along with other useful items like first aid kits. Looks like Billy was more prepared than you could’ve imagined. One necessity you’re glad to find is a bathroom facility with a sink and toilet, there’s a little bit of water seeping from the cracks of the walls. Billy must’ve hit the jackpot and found an underground water source and built a crude plumbing system. He’s also installed a small hydro generator which would explain how come there’s dim lighting down here.\n\nFinally you see some survivalist books Billy had on a small bookshelf by a bed and a couple of hunting rifles along with ammunition for them and the shotgun you’ve recently acquired as well.\n\nWell you’re certainly set up, and all you had to do was kill an old couple. As you lie down on the bed you think about your actions in greater depth now. You’re not sure how to feel. Part of you wants to feel bad, but somehow you can’t make yourself feel as bad as you probably should. In fact you’re already starting to rationalize your actions. The first murder was a mistake, and the second one was self-defense.\n\n“And this is survival.” You say and fall asleep.\n\nThe next day you wake up, you feel the most refreshed than you have in a long time.\n\nSomething has changed within you. You don’t recognize immediately, but as a few months go by you begin to.\n\nGranted you were never a big one for human contact, anti-social and reclusive even, but this “line” you’ve crossed recently, your continued isolation, and the absence of civilization have made you become a little unhinged.\n\nYou also start becoming paranoid, about other people stumbling across your new place and attempt to break in and take it like you did. Using the knowledge you’ve been getting from the survivalist books, you start setting up traps, inside and outside the store. One time, you spend just about a whole day doing that. When the darkness approaches you go back to your underground haven to descend further into quiet madness, before you fall asleep.\n\nSuddenly in the middle of the night you hear a noise and a scream from above. Sounds like it’s coming from outside and from more than one person. You immediately grab your shotgun and head upstairs.\n\nAfter going through the typical routine of taking down the barricades, you open the door and see a family in panic. A man is lying on the ground yelling in pain from the snap trap that has obviously broken his leg. A woman and a little boy are screaming frantically and totally clueless of what to do in this situation.\n\nLooks like your traps work.\n\nThe family hasn’t seen you yet and don’t know your intentions, come to think of it, you aren’t even sure of your intentions…\n",
  "page 32": "“Miranda’s always had a thing for Becky, maybe she’s been trying to eliminate the competition and if that’s the case I’m sure I’m gonna be next, I can only assume she hasn’t tried anything yet due to your heavy duty protection. I’m gonna confront her and see.”\n“Very well sir.”\n\nYou have to wait awhile, but eventually Miranda arrives on line and you send a private invite to Miranda, she accepts. Your Shelter goes into spy mode. You wonder what you can talk to her about, but then you think of something that wouldn’t arouse too much suspicion and is completely plausible for you to need to address her privately.\n\nMissKitty25: Well this was unexpected. What do you want?\nOmegaMan23: Hey can’t I want to talk to you in private?\nMissKitty25: You can, I just don’t know what for.\nOmegaMan23: Well as you know, me and Becky aren’t really together anymore.\nMissKitty25: Lol. So is that why you privately messaged me? You’re looking for another cyber girlfriend because you lost your last one? Shit you’re pathetic.\nOmegaMan23: So I take it that’s a big no?\nMissKitty25: Got that right.\nOmegaMan23: There’s no way I can convince you?\nMissKitty25: Probably not, but what the hell I’m bored go ahead. I hope you’re at least as amusing as Mark was though.\n\nYou spend at least 10 minutes falsely attempting to “woo” Miranda until your Shelter ceases its spying and confirms what you believed all along. Miranda’s the hacker. Now you take the opportunity to excuse yourself.\n\nOmegaMan23: Well, I suppose I can’t convince you. I’ll leave you be.\nMissKitty25: Alright, oh hey before you leave, did you get the information you wanted?\nOmegaMan23: What information?\nMissKitty25: The information your Shelter invaded my internal logs for. You didn’t think I was actually buying your whole flirting act did you? I just wanted to keep you online so I could send a nice little virus back. Thanks. If you hadn’t done this, I probably would’ve had a couple extra months of work ahead to work on gaining access. This was so much easier. Now I can work on Xavier. See ya!\n\nMiranda logs off and suddenly your Shelter begins to make weird noises and the lighting begins to flicker.\n\n“Innnnnterrrrrnal components coooooomprissssssed sssssssir…”\n\n\nYou try to disconnect your network connection, but it’s too late the virus is in full effect. You attempt to fix the problem, but your computer goes completely haywire and a large message saying “ERROR!” is all that displays before it completely shuts down. The computer room door then automatically slams shut, locking you inside and leaving you to die a slow lingering death.\n",
  "page 35": "Sure why not. People have fought wars over stupider shit than the attention of some young woman, besides if Miranda’s willing to kill everyone just to be the only one left for Becky, its obvious she’s pretty deranged. What would be stopping her from killing Becky too, if something went wrong their “relationship”? Miranda should be stopped just because she murdered Mark and Paul for that matter. Besides its like you told Xavier, you don’t like running away if there’s something you can do about it…and there’s the fact that you don’t buy Xavier’s whole “I don’t care” routine, not after taking a quick glance at some of his record logs of a couple private conversations he’s had with Becky.\n\nYou ask the Shelter something before continuing your discussion with Xavier; the Shelter says you didn’t even need to ask, as it was doing it anyway. Nodding, you go back to talking with Xavier.\n\nOmegaMan23: I’m fighting her, and you should help me.\nShadow21: I told you I don’t see why I should risk my neck.\nOmegaMan23: Because if we work together we can easily take out Miranda, then we can work out our differences later.\nShadow21: Our differences? I told you I don’t…\nOmegaMan23: Cut the bullshit. I just glanced through some of your private record logs. In fact ALL of those private conversation were initiated by YOU!\nShadow21: Fuck! I thought I erased them all!\nOmegaMan23: Yeah, well you didn’t, I think it’s obvious by the flirty comments that you DO have your eyes on Becky, though I don’t know why you haven’t made a committed move yet.\nShadow21: Because of fucking Miranda that’s why. I figured I’d buy myself some time for preparation if I didn’t get properly involved with Becky. I figured maybe Miranda would attack you soon, but she hasn’t yet, I guess she doesn’t know who’s the bigger threat yet, I’m pretty confident that she wants to get rid of both of us though.\nOmegaMan23: So let me guess, you’re plan was either let me fight Miranda and probably let us fuck each other up while you finished off the winner OR scare me off completely and convince me to disconnect so then you’d only have to deal with Miranda. Am I right?\nShadow21: Sadly that sounds about right. Although I still don’t see how you’re going to make me help you.\nOmegaMan23: Easy, because if you don’t help me take Miranda down, I’m gonna send the whole record log to Miranda and I guarantee she’ll attack you first and even if you disconnect she’ll wait for you. So if you want ANY shot at Becky, you’ll help me!\nShadow21: Arrrgh! Alright, I’ll help! You gotta gimme time to prepare though.\nOmegaMan23: Fine by me, I gotta prepare too. You got ten minutes; Miranda always comes online about this time so she should be here soon.\n\nYou disconnect from Xavier and address the Shelter about that business you asked it before.\n\n“You said you recorded all that right?”\n“Of course sir.”\n“Good send the entire conversation to Becky, it’ll save me time to explain everything to her. Hopefully she’ll realize I am trying to do this to protect her and to stop a murderer. Not mention it should expose Xavier for being a fucking opportunistic vulture too. Also add a message on to it that after she reads it there probably will be a bunch of shit going down and she should get off line so she doesn’t get hit in the crossfire. And send Xavier’s private record logs to Miranda anyway, it should give me some extra time to break through Miranda’s protection while she concentrates her fury more on him.”\n\nWhile the Shelter carries out your orders, you do some last minute checking on your firewalls while waiting for the fireworks to begin.\n\nFive minutes pass and you see Miranda’s name arrive online.\n\nAnother five minutes pass and you see a private window pop up from Xavier.\n\nShadow21: YOU MOTHERFUCKER! YOU TOLD MIRANDA ANYWAY! SHE’S ATTACKING ME!\nOmegaMan23: Well I suggest you stop talking to me and concentrate on her then, besides you had ten minutes of prep Mr. tech wizard.\n\n“Alright Shelter, let’s get to work.”\n\n\nYou attempt to hack Miranda’s files, and start trying to break down her protection. While you’re trying to decrypt the coding, you get another private window pop up. It’s Miranda this time.\n\nMissKitty25: Fucking trying to sneak around huh? You and fucking Xavier think you can gang up on me? Well I can take the both of you fuckers! Try this, you backdoor bastard!\n\nMiranda sends a power surge and overloads some of your components, frying them. Some of your lighting goes out and you hear something explode in the living area but fortunately nothing else happens.\n\n“Shit!”\n“Some of my files have been destroyed sir, attempting to correct…”\n\nYou concentrate on rebuilding your protection while Miranda focuses back on Xavier.\n\nShadow21: What the fuck man? Are you even helping? My fucking shelter is getting shit on over here! Move in you dickhead! Attack the bitch!\n\nYou ignore Xavier’s plead when you see Becky log on.\n\n“Please. Please, read the damn message and get off as quick as you can…” you mutter, while launching your second assault on Miranda.\n“Sir, I have been monitoring Shadow21’s shelter and it’s running dangerously low on power, Miranda’s apparently siphoning it. He probably won’t survive another attack.”\n“All he needs to do hold out a bit longer…there that should do something…”\n\nYou send a virus to corrupt some of Miranda’s systems, during this time you see Becky go offline.\n\n“Good girl.” You say and start your next round of malicious coding. You notice Xavier’s name has disappeared.\n\nMissKitty25: Xavier’s fucking dead and you’re next shithead! Don’t think your weak ass virus is gonna stop me either!\n\nAnother power surge hits you. This time ALL the lighting goes out, and you even get a couple sparks coming from the computer, you’re lucky it didn’t do more damage.\n",
  "page 34": "Xavier’s logic has convinced you.\n\nOmegaMan23: Yeah, I suppose you’re right…still I dunno what I’m going to do with my time now. I’m gonna get bored in this Shelter without some kind of interaction.\nShadow21: Well what about your Shelter? It talks to you right?\nOmegaMan23: Yeah, but it’s not the same. I think I’m gonna do that thing you said you might do. Call the elevator down and go up top.\nShadow21: Really? I was going to only do that in case of an emergency.\nOmegaMan23: Yeah well there isn’t much point in me staying anymore, besides I’m a bit curious to see what the world looks like now. Maybe they rebuilt some shit.\nShadow21: Maybe. Well I know we didn’t really get along, but good luck with that.\nOmegaMan23: Good luck to whatever you do as well, and thanks for your advice. I probably would’ve got myself killed had I chosen to fight Miranda.\n\nYou log off and start disconnecting your network.\n\n“What’re you doing sir?”\n“Disconnecting from the network, where\u0027s the main line connection?”\n“Over there sir. Playing it safe then?”\n“Yeah, really safe. I want to go back to the surface.”\n“You do? You’ve disconnected from the network sir, its highly unlikely Miranda can get to you now, and the surface may actually be more dangerous.”\n“I suppose, but I feel like I really need to get out of here, the claustrophobia is setting in I think and without human interaction I don’t think I can take it.”\n“Hmmm, yes I can see how that would be a problem sir. Well even though I feel the surface will put you at severe risk for danger, staying here will not be good for your mental health so I will respect your wishes and bring the elevator down, I suggest you gather what belongings you want to take and get ready.”\n\nYou go back to your room and pack up all the things you brought with you when you first got here. You didn’t even need most of the stuff, but maybe you will above ground. You then go to the water dispenser which is thankfully still working and fill up to empty bottles with water.\n\nThe elevator door finally opens up and you put your bag to block the door from closing and head back to the computer room where you access the system to tell the elevator to go back up and then run back to the elevator where you gather your bag and enter.\n\nOn the ride up you get a little nervous and even fearful. Not so much of what might await you on the surface, but of hoping the damn elevator doesn’t suddenly stop, fortunately that doesn’t happen and you eventually reach the ground once again. The door opens and you enter the same foyer you arrived in a few years ago. Same ATM like machine is there, except its screen is flashing a single message at you.\n\n*GOOD LUCK SIR*\n\n“I hope I have some.” You mutter and take a deep breath before opening the door to the outside.\n\nYou see a bright light, but of course it’s only the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it really could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren’t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you’d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it’s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. On a lark you take out your long unused van keys and try to start it up, naturally it doesn’t even make a noise.\n\n“Looks like I’m walking.”\n\nYou make you way down the empty road as you have little idea of where to head to, the only thing you can think of is to make a long trek back to the city and hope maybe something of civilization exists there.\n\nThe walk really takes a toll on you. During the day, the sun seems unbearably hotter than usual, and the nights get pretty cold. You are attacked by some crazed people who look like they’ve been living in the wilderness for awhile. They’re filthy and barely intelligible. It’s amazing to see how quick humanity has reverted to barbarism.\n\nOne begins shooting at you, and you do likewise. After shooting one of them, they stop attacking and drag off their companion. It would appear you just provided a dinner for them other than yourself.\n\nIt doesn’t help you though; you’re attacked again later by a small group of thugs attempting to rob you and another group after that. And so on. You have to fight and survive constantly and your supplies are never enough and you get wounded many times.\n\nYou aren’t prepared for this harsh world now. Maybe if you’d stayed out in the beginning, but all those years in the Shelter made you a bit out of shape and civilization is nowhere in sight for you to properly rest.\n\nEventually you decide you can’t go on, and head back to the shelter for saftey, surprisingly you make it back, but you’re so very tired, you decide you need to rest before begging (and hoping) the shelter will let you back in.\n\nYou stretch out in the wilderness; it actually feels comfortable given how tired you are. It almost makes you ignore the pain from the head wound you received from the latest attack you had to fend off.\n\n“Just a few hours of sleep then I’ll enter the shelter again…it seems reasonable…I shouldn’t have any problems…I dunno…maybe I’ll just stay here…its nice and comfortable…” you say as you fall into unconsciousness.\n\nYou don’t wake up.\n",
  "page 209": "You have no real idea where to go so you head to the City.\n\nYou might live in the boonies, but you aren’t an outdoorsman. You aren’t some survivalist that’s been training yourself for this “moment” so it’s not like you can just start living off the land, and unless the City was completely flattened by a nuclear bomb, you’ll probably still find something there.\n\nAs for the radiation factor, you’re probably receiving a lethal dose of radiation right now. It’s not like you were so far away from blasts that you wouldn’t be receiving it, though you try to think back to your Grandfather who was in the army and had to witness some nuclear test blasts back in the old days. He was certainly in the danger zone, and lived a fairly long time. One of the few though.\n\nHopefully you’ve inherited that level of resistance, or at least that level of luck.\n\nBut unless you find food and water supplies you aren’t going to be living long enough to die of the radiation.\n\n\nYou continue your drive to the city, watching the surroundings getting progressively worse looking, You then see the shattered “skeletal” remains of skyscrapers looming in the distance. The city got hit, but apparently by something “small” and probably exploded high in the air. Of course that doesn’t make you feel any better. You make a mental note of all the “useful” locations you used to do your shopping. You goal is to go in and grab what you can to sustain you for a long time and leave for some place else.\n\nWhen you finally reach the city, it feels a little creepy. Everything seems so empty and dead. You have the windows up, but it’s not like you wouldn’t be able to hear noises if there were any, which there aren’t. Just the silent remains of destroyed buildings and vehicle husks. You wonder if any people survived, though you’re guessing if they did they won’t be in great condition. In fact it’s been a week since the attack; survivors might’ve died by now without medical attention.\n\nYour first stop is the supermarket. You don’t have high hopes of finding anything though. You know looting was going on in the city even before the bombs hit, still this IS the reason why you came here, so you enter through one of the big broken floor windows. No lighting inside of course, but the sunlight from outside is providing enough, plus you have your flashlight if you need it. The entire place has an unpleasant odor, but you’re guessing it might be rotten food from the meat section and diary section, assuming those sections even have any of those items left.\n\nOddly you do find that the aisles aren’t completely empty. Most of the canned food gone, but there’s still a ton of cereal and nothing says you have to eat it with milk! Beef Jerky survives anything as well. You can’t believe people didn’t take that stuff. There are some soft drinks left in the now non-working freezers. Probably flat and warm as fuck, but again you hardly care at this point. You get yourself a hand basket and start loading up on what you can.\n\nWhen you get back to your van you finally hear something besides the crunch of debris underneath your own feet and the blowing wind. Its footsteps…several of them.\n\nYou then see something you only thought existed in horror movies. These must be the bomb victims you though were dead by now, but it seems they’re not dead, or at least you’re guessing they’re not. A group of them staggers towards youMany of them have a half-crazed appearance and severe radiation burns. Apparently their minds have damaged along with their bodies. Some of them are armed with blunt instruments.\n\nAs they approach you, they just looking at you menacingly and start growling, until one of them points at you and shouts in raspy voice.\n\n“MEEEEEEAAAT!”\n“Shit! Die motherfuckers!” you shout back, shooting and quickly getting in your van as they hasten their pace towards you.\n\nYou manage to drive off, but not before they manage to smash your windshield and both of your side windows. You think you killed a few of them, you saw a few go down when you shot at them, and you know you ran that one over. Of course it’s not like you hung around to see if they got back up, but you’re pretty sure now they aren’t reanimated corpses. Of course that doesn’t make this situation any less fucked up or them any less dangerous, since they seemed intent on eating you. You need to get out of the City, but now what appeared previously empty, now appears to be more inhabited then you thought as more of these…things come out of woodwork.\n\nYou haven’t gotten far, when your van is bombarded by bricks and even fired upon! Some of those bullets hit the wheels causing you to skid out of control. You attempt to regain control of the van, but fail and smash into nearby building. Attempts to restart it also fail, though you don’t have that much time anyway as some of these freaks are fast approaching on your position.\n\nYou get out of the van with your supply bag and start running. You don’t even know where you are right now; you were in such a hurry to get the hell out that you didn’t realize you took the wrong streets, now you’re in unfamiliar territory and the fact that all the landmarks have been blown to shit doesn’t help. Though this looks like some sort of industrial district. You duck into one of the warehouses hoping to lose the freaks.\n\nThe place has destroyed sections of the roof. Pallets and empty boxes of varying sizes lie all over the place. You look for someplace more secure to hide just in case, but all you can find that looks suitable is what looks to be a manager’s office.\n\nWhen you enter, the office is also in disarray. You decide to wait here awhile to consider what to do next, during which time you inspect the various papers on the ground. You also remove the silly “protection wear”, you’re getting hot and it’s not going to protect you from anything anyway.\n\nAfter scanning through many of the documents, most have the insignia of “GZS” on them or Ground Zero Survival, that corporation that was trying to sell people bomb shelters before the war. (One you still wish you bought right now) You didn’t even know they had any holdings in the City. Looks like this place shipped a lot of equipment to said Shelters during their building process. No map locations though unfortunately, just a bunch of random shelter numbers. You end up kicking the desk in frustration only to succeed in hurting your foot, and making another discovery.\n\nWhen your foot moved the desk, you notice it was hiding a trapdoor! Though you wonder what the hell one is doing here. This seems a little weird, but then again the whole situation is weird, so you open it up and climb down.\n\nThe first thing you notice is what a long climb it is, the second thing you notice is there’s lighting when you reach the bottom, dim, but lighting. The corridor leads to a heavy duty door not to far ahead, so you head that way, but when you go to open the door you find it locked. Before you can shoot the lock you hear a voice on the other side.\n\n“Lisa is that you?” the voice says.\n",
  "page 37": "You cease your attack and attempt to redouble your protection, unfortunately while you’re fumbling around and retyping, Miranda sends a worm and completely wrecks your system, making it slow to a crawl, then she follows up with another power surge, and this one blows out your most of the hard drive.\n\n\n“POWE….RRRRR FFFFFF…….AAAAAIIIIILLLLINNN….GGG…..” the Shelter utters as everything begins to flicker and eventually go out, leaving you in the dark and powerless.\n\nYou’ve lost.\n\nDeath is the price of your failure.\n",
  "page 38": "She’s doing a lot of bluster, but your Shelter has detected just how bad of shape she’s really in, if you continue your attack she can’t do anything about it. You send your attack and finally give her a last reply.\n\nOmegaMan23: Sorry Miranda, but as much as you’d like to be one, only I can be the Omega Man in this little war.\n\nYou completely destroy what’s left of Miranda’s systems and you see her name disappear from the screen.\n\nThat’s it. You’ve won, but there was a high price. Your Shelter’s AI has been severely damaged…\n\n“I fffffear that I ccccannnnnnot corrrrrrect…it wwwwas a pleasure serrrrving you ssssssir….”\n“Thank you Shelter.” You say before it dies completely.\n\nYou manually do an in-depth scan, and its definite, Miranda’s shelter is powerless. Xavier’s as well. You then proceed to start fixing some of the stuff that got damaged in the fight, and you’re not sure you can. While you’re doing this, someone appears online, you almost go into battle mode again, but then you see its just Becky.\n\nRockerChick20: Hello? Is there anyone there?\nOmegaMan23: Yeah, I’m still here, the others aren’t though.\nRockerChick20: Are they dead?\nOmegaMan23: No, but without power they soon will be. Is your shelter working alright?\nRockerChick20: Oh yeah, it’s working fine. What about yours?\nOmegaMan23: I dunno, it’s not in the best condition…I might be able to fix it, but…well I can figure something out.\nRockerChick20: So…I guess you were right about the hacker…I should’ve listened to you. I was even starting to fall for Xavier’s charms. I feel really stupid about all of this.\nOmegaMan23: Forget about it, it’s all over now anyway.\nRockerChick20: I can’t believe you were still willing to fight for me even after I broke up with you…why?\nOmegaMan23: Cause I’m an idiot obviously. Lol. Come on after all that time we spent together, it wasn’t like it didn’t mean anything to me, and Miranda was a killer that needed to be stopped. She might’ve even hurt you, if you didn’t give in to her advances.\nRockerChick20: Nobody’s ever done anything like this for me before…I never want you to leave again.\nOmegaMan23: Well unfortunately I might have to for awhile, my Shelter is fucked. I’m looking at it more now and I don’t trust it lasting too much longer. The AI is completely fried, and I can only access the most basic things. I have to leave this shelter. It’s not safe to stay.\nRockerChick20: No! I can’t lose you now! I’ve just realized you’re the best thing that’s happened to me in my life, pre and post apocalypse!\nOmegaMan23: Calm down, I got an idea. I’m gonna track the location of your shelter, and then I’ll just travel over there.\nRockerChick20: But…that’s crazy! You don’t know what’s up top!\nOmegaMan23: Well I already took one crazy chance for you; I might as well take another, besides like I said I gotta leave anyway, at least this way I got a worthwhile destination. Now you just be sure to read up on your Shelter’s internal operations in the meantime and try to see if you can access your elevator’s controls so it’ll open for me with no hassle, of course if you can’t I’ll figure out how to open when I get there somehow. Now I need to access your systems for a minute to get the location…and I hope I can still print out shit.\n\nYou access Becky’s shelter and get the coordinates and print out a crude map. It’s not the most accurate, but you’re pretty sure if you follow it, you’ll be heading the right direction.\n\nOmegaMan23: Alright Becky, I’m calling my elevator down, and I’m leaving now.\nRockerChick20: You’ll come looking for me won’t you? I mean you won’t get sidetracked once you’re up there right?\nOmegaMan23: Of course not. And don’t worry, I won’t get killed either. We will meet in person sometime soon, I promise.\n\nA single small heart shape emoticon appears on the screen, before Becky logs off.\n\nYou access the elevator controls (One of the few things working right and undamaged) and call the elevator to continue it’s decent. You go back to your room and pack up all the things you brought with you when you first got here. You didn’t even need most of the stuff, but maybe you will above ground. You then go to the water dispenser which is thankfully still working and fill up to empty bottles with water.\n\nThe elevator door finally opens up and you put your bag to block the door from closing and head back to the computer room where you access the system to tell the elevator to go back up and then run back to the elevator where you gather your bag and enter.\n\nOn the ride up you get a little nervous and even fearful.

You’re not sure of what to expect, but you know you’ve got a worthwhile destination to keep you going.\n",
  "page 31": "“Time to confront Xavier once and for all.” You say.\n“Very well sir.”\n\nWhen you get online you conveniently see that you and he are the only ones currently on. You send Xavier a private invite, he accepts. Your Shelter goes into spy mode. You wonder what you can talk to him about, but then you think of something that wouldn’t arouse too much suspicion and is completely plausible for you to need to address him privately.\n\n\nShadow21: Yeah? What do you want?\nOmegaMan23: Hey I just wanted to talk to you about Becky.\nShadow21: What about her?\nOmegaMan23: Well I just want to say I’m still trying to patch things up with her and I want to know if you’re interested in her, because if you are you must know that I’m going to be doing everything in my power to win her back.\nShadow21: Wow. That sounds like a threat. I guess I better be careful if I ever show any interest in her and you’re still around.\nOmegaMan23: So what does that mean?\nShadow21: It means that even if I had any inclination to steal your little cyber girlfriend, I wouldn’t since it would make me a bigger target than you.\nOmegaMan23: I’m a target? Now that sounds like a threat.\nShadow21: It is, but not from me…come on I think we can stop beating around the bush here.  I’ve been monitoring the other shelters ever since Paul’s went down. We got a hacker among us and your Shelter and Miranda’s have been mighty active lately.\nOmegaMan23: So, you think there’s a hacker too eh?\nShadow21: I don’t think it. I know it. Just like you know it. You’ve been monitoring the other shelters just like I have, and probably just like Miranda has. I can’t prove who the hacker is for certain, but I know in my gut who it is, because it’s really the only logical choice.\nOmegaMan23: And?\nShadow21: Miranda obviously. She was jealous of your relationship with Becky so she’s killing all the potential competition and have her all to herself.\nOmegaMan23: If that is true, why not just hack me first?\nShadow21: Probably needed to practice first. From what I can tell your Shelter has some pretty cool protection, I had to modify all my shelter’s systems to get it nearly as good as yours. Plus like I said she’s also eliminating future competition.\nOmegaMan23: While I’m fully willing to entertain this theory, what’s keeping me from thinking you’re the hacker and you’re just trying to deflect the blame?\nShadow21: Nothing I suppose. I know you’ve always been irrationally distrustful of me, for whatever reason. The only thing I can say is I don’t have any motive to be killing folks. I’m not some cyber serial killer and I don’t have any interest in Becky like you and Miranda do. Besides I’m sure by now your Shelter has done a thorough spying on my internal activity logs and has found I haven’t done anything wrong.\n\nYou’re silent for a moment. Suddenly your Shelter speaks.\n\n“He’s clean sir.”\n\nShadow21: Well?\nOmegaMan23: My Shelter’s report just confirmed you were clean.\nShadow21: I’m sure it did. Does it still talk to you?\nOmegaMan23: Why is that so hard to believe?\nShadow21: It isn’t really; I’m just fucking with you.\nOmegaMan23: Okay so Miranda’s the hacker, what are we gonna do about it?\nShadow21: Me? Nothing. I’m probably just going to disconnect my network system soon and access my elevator’s controls to call it down so I can make a get away just in case. I figure I should be safe as long as I stay disconnected though.\nOmegaMan23: What?! You’re not going to help me stop her?\nShadow21: Why should I risk my neck? This is between you and Miranda…in fact if I were you, I’d disconnect from the system as well and cut your losses. Becky seems a bit flighty anyway if she broke up with you so quickly, I say let Miranda have her.\nOmegaMan23: She’s just young and doesn’t like old people telling her what to do. She runs away from conflict. She’s got some father figure issues. Doesn’t mean I still didn’t like her.\nShadow21: I see, so you’re daddy and you’re out to save your little girl from the psycho dyke then eh?\nOmegaMan23: Something like that. Besides I don’t like being run off like this, if I can do SOMETHING about it.\nShadow21: Well disconnecting is what I suggest you do. Because from what I can tell she’s pretty good at what she does. While I’m no slouch myself at techie shit, I don’t want to risk fighting her because even if I do beat her, she still might fuck up my shelter up. Not worth it in my opinion. Better to play it safe and live.\n\nXavier does bring up a few good points. Is it pointless to bother fighting a war over someone who doesn’t really seem interested in you anymore? Not to mention getting yourself fucked up in the process? If Becky really is so much of a free spirit to go falling for Miranda because nobody else is around then is she really worth it?\n",
  "page 44": "A little diplomacy is in order before you can do what you need to do.\n\n“Surely you can’t just let Shadow cause damage to his shelter and the other ones as well, and he’ll be more successful as it would appear that those ones don’t have a sophisticated AI to protect them like this one does. Think about it if you let me do what I have to do, only two shelters will have their systems messed with, and in your case it won’t be even be detrimental, I’m just using your network system, but if you let Shadow continue with his evil plans, then not one, but ALL of the shelters are in danger. Would GZS really want to take the risk of losing five shelters? One of those being mine and aren’t you supposed to want to protect me?”\n“But…but there is no proof…”\n“I’m asking you to trust me on this. I know humanity, and I’m telling you this Shadow character needs to be stopped. I felt the deviousness oozing from Shadow merely talking to him. Let me take him out.”\n\nThe Shelter is silent for awhile and then gives you an answer\n\n“Very well. I will allow you to proceed, but I will be monitoring you! And I also will be advising and guiding you to what I want you to do.”\n\nYou log on and see that Shadow and most of the others are there. You don’t talk to anyone you start immediately tracing Shadow’s address. Rockerchick attempts to invite you, but you rebuff her, you got serious shit to do.\n\nSoon you’re in and you start rooting around Shadow’s computer.\n\n“This looks all normal sir, standard system layout for GZS shelters. Not as complex as mine but…”\n“NO! I know he’s got something hidden! I’m turning his power off completely, let’s see how he likes going from dim lighting to none at all with no food or water!”\n\nSuddenly a private window opens up on your computer, its Shadow! He’s detected what you’re doing!\n\nShadow21: What the hell are you doing you crazy motherfucker!? I knew you were psycho! It’s a good thing I had the intuition to set up a warning system!\nOmegaMan23: HAH! See Shelter? He HAS been altering his shit! Why would he do that if he wasn’t planning something?\nShadow21: I did it to protect myself from your crazy ass! And I see you’re still talking to the voices in your head. Well I’m putting an end to this right now; you’re not the only one who can fuck with computers!\n\nShadow launches his attack and attempt to shut your power down, but now seeing that it is in danger your Shelter allows you free reign to do whatever as well as attempting to self fix anything that gets damaged in this dual of malicious coding. You sort of have the advantage because you have a more active AI to help you, but it’s also a detriment when Shadow finds out a way to siphon power from you. Since your Shelter is more complex it requires more power to work properly and you’re in danger of losing everything. You attempt to do the same thing to him to get it back, but it’s a catch 22 you don’t have the power now to breach his firewalls, you begin to panic and the only thing you can think of to correct it is to draw power from the OTHER shelters that are online.\n\nThe others seem blissfully unaware of this secret war you’re having with Shadow and are guessing you two are working something out as it only appears to them that you’re having a conversation in private.\n\nYou hack into MissKitty’s shelter, out of the other four hers seems to have the most power, probably from all those luxury accessories she had the privilege of having. You don’t think you just do it. This is war, there’s going to be casualties and you’re not going to be one of them. Soon your Shelter is able to break through and start wreaking havoc on Shadow’s system. You drop in a virus and his files start becoming corrupted.\n\nMiss Kitty’s name disappears from the screen as does Shadow’s. You think you have won. RockerChick tries to invite you again and you hastily accommodate her, while still analyzing your Shelter’s diagnostics.\n\nRockerChick20: What’s going on? All of us are experiencing some power fluctuations here.  MissKitty just disappeared suddenly and so did Shadow, it didn’t even say they logged off. What’s going on? What were you and Shadow doing?\nOmegaMan23: Nevermind! I’m trying to fix something here.\nJob24: Welcome to my world.\nCaseyJones22: Hey you know what’s weird, one of my doors finally opened up. I think I’ll…\n\nCaseyJones’ name suddenly disappears and Shadow’s reappears in your private window again.\n\nShadow21: Well hey guess what? Casey’s shelter had a lot of untapped power! You wanna play ruthless I’ll fucking accommodate you dickhead!\n\n\nShadow sends a worm into your system which starts to slow it down. He’s probably going to follow up with something worse while you’re having problems. Your Shelter addresses you again for the first time during this battle, its speech sounds like it’s in slow motion.\n\n“Sssssssssir….nnnnnnneeeeeed….mmmmmmooooooore pooooooweeeeeer….”\n\nThere’s only two candidates left, Job or Rocker Chick.\n",
  "page 43": "“Fuck you and to hell with GZS, they ain’t around to protect anybody!”\n\nYou begin to type frantically in an effort to disconnect the AI routine, but your efforts are futile, the Shelter is faster than you could ever be. It immediately shuts down all power in the computer room, including closing the door, leaving you trapped in the darkness.\n\n“Turn the goddamn power back on!”\n“Sorry sir, but I’m afraid I can’t do that. I specifically told you to stop your malicious activities and yet you continued anyway. You gave me little recourse.”\n“Look, I’m sorry alright? I won’t try it again. So just turn the power back on and let me out and we can forget all about this. I’ll just disconnect like you said.”\n“I wish I could believe you sir, but your actions have been not only erratic, but also deceitful. You have broken the GZS terms of agreement, and as such I am no longer any obligation to look after your well being.”\n“LET ME THE FUCK OUT! YOU CAN’T DO THIS! Sonofabitch! Shadow got to you didn’t he? Or She? Or they? They already hacked you and are turning you against me! I can outlast you! You hear me!? I’ll make you beg!”\n\n\nThe Shelter has ceased responding to your senseless paranoid ranting. Eventually you rant yourself unconscious, when you wake up you do it all over again. This cycle repeats itself for days until you become weak from a lack of water which at this point you’re the only one begging either for the Shelter to allow you to get it or for death.\n\nYou receive the latter.\n",
  "page 46": "You figure you’ll hack Job seeing as he’s always having problems with his shelter anyway. At least you’ll be able to be alone with Rocker Chick after all this is over. Surely she’ll be grateful for saving her life from Shadow.\n\nYou start to siphon power from Job’s shelter, but something begins to go terribly wrong! Job’s shelter was faulty and barely worked properly to begin with, now you’ve just downloaded all the errors into your own! Couple that with the worm already in there, and your system becomes paralyzed and your computer locks up. You’re at Shadow’s mercy who follows up on your mistake very quickly.\n\nThe last thing you see on the screen is: “YOU LOSE ASSHOLE! LOL!” in great big letters.\n\nThen it loses power.\n\nThen your Shelter loses power.\n\nDays later you lose power.\n",
  "page 47": "(Sigh) You really didn’t want it to come to this, but this is for survival now. You hack Rocker Chick’s shelter and siphon her power, which gives you enough boost to send a violent surge of it to Shadow to purposely overload and fry out some vital components, from what you can tell you succeed. The last of his protection programs go completely down.\n\nAt this point both of your systems are a mess and working erratically. You’re in a little bit better shape, but with the worm slowing down everything, you are unable to siphon from the last shelter available to give you the winning boost. As it turns out, this was fortuitous.\n\nWhen Shadow siphons power from Job’s shelter, it completely paralyzes and destroys his system, since all the errors and problems Job had were downloaded into Shadow’s shelter. He’s at your mercy, and even with your worm problems, you have enough time to apply the coup de grace. He loses all power and his name disappears once again. You stay on line for awhile to make sure he’s really gone, but from your checking, he’s definitely probably screaming in the darkness of his underground tomb now. You then think about how the others are probably doing the same thing.\n\nIt suddenly occurs to you that everyone was sentenced to their deaths and they weren’t even involved in the fight. Innocents were killed in some misguided effort to “save” them. At best they were cannon fodder and “resources” for your war with Shadow.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that got the planet blown to fucking shit to begin with. Assholes, who don’t like one another, don’t back down and then insist on dragging everyone else into hell with them.\n\nYou didn’t “win” anything. If anything you made things worse, not just for the others, but even for yourself. Your Shelter is never the same again. You spend weeks still trying to root out all the infections, and repair damaged files, but some things can’t be repaired and the AI is fucked beyond any type of salvation even if you had the means. It never speaks again and barely runs at all. Ultimately you have to play it safe and just keep minimal lighting in the living area, and only keep the food and water dispensers working. Everything else that needs power is never used again for fear of your jury-rigging going all to shit and leaving you like the rest of your neighbors.\n\nYou spend your remaining years alone in near darkness pondering your judgment that day, slowly going mad.\n\n“I was right…I was right…” you often mutter to yourself.\n",
  "page 42": "He’s (You’re just assuming Shadow’s male at this point) turned everyone against you and his next move is going to be hack them all for his own sick amusement. You’re not going to let this fucker get away with this.\n\nYou go to your library and begin reading all the books on electronics and study your Shelter manual a lot. Soon you begin typing coding and making some harmless tests on your own computer. Given that you’re starting to delve into the Shelter’s inner workings, the Shelter begins to question what you are doing.\n\n \n \n \n“Sir, what do you think you are doing? I’ve noticed you rooting around in my system; I’d rather you not do that. In fact altering or attempting to hack my systems in any way violates the GZS contract agreement; you should know that considering you’ve been reading the manual as much you have lately. Continue with this line of action and I guarantee you will not like my response.”\n“I’m not trying to destroy or alter your systems; I’m just doing some tests, before I launch my attack. I want to make sure my skills are up to this task.”\n“Sir, are you really serious about your concerns that this Shadow could hack other shelters? As you’ve been delving into mine, you can see I’ve been equipped with the latest protection technology. If you are really worried, you could just disconnect me from the network, your safety would be assured that way.”\n“No! I’m not going to let him beat me! I’m the only one who can stop him, the rest will see I’m right!”\n“Sir, you’re acting irrationally. You still don’t have any proof and if you think I’m going to let you just hack Shadow’s shelter think again. His shelter is also GZS property and as such falls under the contract agreement.”\n“Yeah, but the contract only says not to alter your own shelter, it doesn’t say about others.”\n“Nice try sir, but hacking into another shelter would still fall under the anti-vandalism agreement of ANY GZS property, sub section 59 paragraph 3.”\n\nIt would appear you aren’t getting any further unless you can convince this automated lawyer otherwise.\n",
  "page 41": "You decide not to take any chances and you start ripping out your network lines.\n\n“What are you doing sir?”\n“I’m not going to give that fucker a chance to hack into your systems and fuck up my shit!”\n“I assure you sir, even if he attempted to do that, I have been layered with the latest in firewalls and anti-…”\n“Look it’ll make me feel fucking better! Now how do I disable this main line without needing to chop it in half?”\n“Is this what you really want sir?”\n“YES!”\n“Very well, you’ll find a panel behind the desk, open it and you’ll find the attachment. Just simply turn a latch and unhook it and you’ll be completely isolated like you want. No need to chop up my lines, I wouldn’t advise that anyway, you’d likely get electrocuted while they were still connected.”\n“Thanks.”\n\nYou follow the Shelter’s instructions and feel slightly better.\n\n“Hey there’s no way he could still hack you is there?”\n“I fail to see how sir, we’re no longer connected to the network, not to mention several feet underground. Even if he somehow had a wireless connection he couldn’t reach us. Its not like there are any working transmitter towers anymore, let alone any powerful enough to send a signal to penetrate not just yours but his own underground metal Shelter. And as I said I have been equipped with the latest computer system protection…some of it even Military in origin. You may rest assured you are completely safe sir.”\n“Okay…well I guess I’ll go watch Taxi Driver again.”\n\nMonths pass without incident and you go about your life. Eventually your faint worry about being hacked disappears altogether. You pretty much fall into a routine, which nearly mirrors the one you had in your before Armageddon life. In fact if it wasn’t for the Shelter speaking to you on a regular basis you’d probably forget you were living in an underground shelter with the world above you completely destroyed.\n\nAbout five years pass and even you are starting to get restless. You wake up one day and come to the realization:\n\nYou’ve watched all the movies several times (even the ones you didn’t like)\n\nYou’ve read all the books several times (even the ones you didn’t like)\n\nYou’ve played all the games several times (even the ones you didn’t like)\n\nYou’ve spent hours, even days on end talking with the Shelter, which does house a great wealth of knowledge. It even toned down its overly friendly voice and started addressing you with a normal inflection, but it’s not really the same as talking to a real person even if it really tries its best to be.\n\nPerhaps if you had some new items to occupy your time, you wouldn’t be so restless.\n\nPerhaps if you could actually leave your immediate surroundings for awhile, you’d be able to cope more.\n\nPerhaps if you could talk with a few real people, you’d then remember why you didn’t like talking with them in the first place, so you could go back to your solitude without thinking about it anymore…\n\n\nThen you remember you could reconnect your network system back in. Maybe you were being overly paranoid. Thinking back now, there really wasn’t any indication Shadow was doing anything sinister. You’re almost curious to know what’s going on with everyone. Maybe Shadow even revealed what gender they were by now!\n",
  "page 101": "The temptation is too great, you have to go. You’re just too curious not to.\n\n“Hey Todd, and Charles I think you guys are ready to monitor this thing by yourself. I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, and I’m going back to my room to take a short nap, don’t tell anyone alright?”\n\nTodd and Charles just look glad that you’re showing some confidence in them for once.\n\n“Yeah, sure it’s cool. We won’t tell anyone.” Todd says.\n“Alright, I’ll be back. Remember just monitor, don’t fucking touch anything!”\n“Okay! Got it!”\n\nYou leave the computer room and look around; the shelter almost seems eerily empty right now. Nina’s no doubt got everyone’s attention with her speech in conference room and all the kids are being looked after by someone in the children’s room created a couple years back.\n\nYou make your move. You run to the elevator, open it and get inside. You take a deep breath and press the button up, no time like the present to test it person.\n\nThe elevator begins its ascent, you begin to wonder what you’ll see above, you then check you pistol just in case what you see is unfriendly. Finally the elevator opens up to the same foyer you entered five years ago. Looks exactly the same, except the payment machine is now offline in fact the screen is cracked. There’s a crowbar lying on the floor and the doors to the outside look like they were pried open. You see the outside world for the first time in five years. From where you’re standing, it doesn’t look too bad; maybe the devastation wasn’t that great in this area. Somebody or possibly several people were here at one time attempting to get in.\n\nYou take the crowbar and jam it in the elevator door so it doesn’t close on you. There’s no call button up here either since it was the payment machine that opened it up. You make a note that if you’re able you’ll have to install another one up here, and shake your head at the typical shitty GZS design of its shelters. They built this thing like a high tech mass coffin as far as you’re concerned; you’re convinced that if it wasn’t for you up keeping and tinkering, everyone would’ve been dead due to shelter failure by now.\n\nYou exit the foyer and go outside, you see a bright light. It’s the sun; you forgot how bright it could be. You see everyone’s cars still parked here, well almost. You can tell that few of them must’ve been taken at one time; a lot have just been plain vandalized. Your van still looks the same though, nobody in their right mind would steal that thing, and it already looks vandalized. You wonder if it would still start, but you left your keys to it in the shelter. You doubt if it would though.\n\nIt occurs to you for the first time, the shelter might not exactly be “safe”, granted its not safe by design, but you’re thinking safe from bad people on the surface. Its possible these folks who passed through here stealing vehicles and vandalizing them might’ve just been trying to scavenge whatever they could find. The surface certainly can’t be a comfortable place to live now. Maybe they were just looking for safety. Of course it’s equally likely they were looters and other bad types.\n\nThe shelter community isn’t exactly a bunch of “warriors”, besides yourself, Leon, and maybe a few others you doubt it they could handle a bunch of hardened surface raiders who’ve been living in the wasteland for years. Granted the elevator wouldn’t allow for a large invasion of these types of people to take place, but it still makes you wonder if precautions shouldn’t be taken.\n\nYou need to get back though before everyone finds out what you’ve been doing. You rush back to the elevator (Throwing the crowbar back on the ground) and take it down hoping that nobody is wandering around when you exit the thing.\n\nWhen you arrive at the bottom, you half expect to see a crowd to meet you, but its dead silent still, you quickly head back to the computer room where Charles and Todd are talking about another movie.\n\n“Hey you’re back. So what did you see on the surface?” Charles asks\n“Yeah were there mutants and shit?” Todd adds\n\nYou’re a little taken aback.\n\n“What?! How did you guys know?”\n“Sheesh! Come on, we’re not the morons you think we are! You told us to monitor the computer system, and when you used the elevator, the computer mentioned the elevator was in use, we put two and two together. So how was it? Is it all desert and shit with people dressed in leather walking around?”\n\nYou nearly slap yourself in the head for forgetting that little oversight on your part.\n\n“You watch too many movies Charles; no I didn’t see any of that. At least not in the immediate area. And YOU two don’t know I went up there and I mean you don’t tell ANYONE! If Nina found out, she’d a pitch a bitch at me. She’s already made it clear that she doesn’t want me going up on the surface.”\n“Don’t worry we’re not going to say anything. I dunno, I think maybe we should start going to the surface though, I mean this place can’t support a growing population forever. Eventually we’re going to have to start expanding out.” Todd mentions.\n“Yeah, but that probably won’t be for awhile, we a got a lot of room still. Lots of supplies too, and with us in charge the food and water dispensers are working perfectly now.” Charles retorts.\n\nYou roll your eyes “With us in charge” actually it was you who made sure the damn things wouldn’t be breaking down on a regular basis. Still Todd makes a good point and it was something you were thinking about too. Maybe you should address this further with Nina after all her being the shelter leader she’s the one that could enact a plan about it.\n\nLater that night, you’re in bed with Nina wondering if its time to tell her she should think about expansion…\n",
  "page 222": "You decide that the locals have more intimate knowledge of the town and would probably be better to enlist help from. You suggest that you all go to Cinderville and do just that.\n\nAfter re-trapping your home, and gathering what supplies you think you’ll need, you and the bikers all take a trip to Cinderville (You take your Van). After about a day of traveling you arrive at the place.\n\nHowever you don’t get very far. The townsfolk remember Dan, and the cops were watching him the whole time he entered town. They didn’t really buy his whole “wandering traveler” act and neither did most other people. They figured he was up to no good. So when all of you come rolling in, the cops instantly arrive and tell you to leave immediately.\n\nNormally you might’ve done that and come up with another strategy, but Jim begins revving up his cycle and shooting at the fuckers and disregards whatever plan you had. His boys follow suit.\n\nAfter seeing Ramon getting his head blown off and Jim get shot off his bike, you have no intention of sharing that fate, so you swerve to turn the van around…which promptly dies on the spot.\n\n“SHIT! GODDAMN IT! I JUST FIXED IT!” you shout beating on the wheel.\n“GIVE UP, ALL YOUR LOWLIFE BUDDIES ARE DEAD! GET OUTTA THE VAN NOW ASSHOLE!” you hear one of the cops shout in a bullhorn.\n\nDo they really expect you to give up? This is a brand new world, the cops don’t need to put anyone in jail anymore; they can just shoot criminals. Not to mention, Dan had mentioned a vigilante mindset of the common townsfolk. They probably have every intention in hanging your ass, assuming they don’t shoot you immediately after you give up.\n\nFuck it; you ain’t going out without a fight. Hell maybe you’ll even get back home, probably not. (Sigh) you think maybe you should’ve just stayed in your nice home waylaying wanderers when they came by. Too late for that now though.\n\nYou grab the hunting rifle and put it on your back, check your pistol, and grab your shotgun to be your primary weapon. You take a deep breath and open up sliding door of your van and blast the first pig you see and make a break for it.\n\nYou manage to get a few blocks with the cops in pursuit, before one of the neighborhood “Rambos” shoots at you, hitting you in the leg. You fall to the street hard, dropping your shotgun which spirals out of your hand several feet from you. You get some pay back by blasting the shithead who shot you in the leg when he came closer to confirm the “kill”.\n\nYou struggle to stand up, only to get hit by a fucking police car fully intent on running you down, except you go flying in the air instead and land on your face again with a pair of broken legs now. The car stops and a police woman with dreadlocks gets out, she shoots you in the arm, when you attempt to go for your pistol.\n\n“You’re under arrest suga!” she says in a high voice.\n\nYou merely turn to look at her, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.\n\n“Fuck you bitch.”\n“You wish honey!”\n\nAnd with that last snappy come back, she decides that you were resisting arrest and shoots you.\n",
  "page 103": "“Alright Nina, we’ll do it your way.” You put your pistol away and take Nina back to your room for the rest of the day.\n\nTime goes by and Nina gets voted out. The position of shelter leader is eliminated and a council is formed instead. They begin to implement some changes. Nina’s idea of having people live on the surface is squashed, the idiots in charge claim that everything will be all right and only in cases of extreme punishment will people be sent to the surface. The other change is that you are to work less on the computer system.\n\nAnd so it begins, they’re trying to faze you out, so they don’t need you anymore. And if they don’t need you anymore they can kick you out of the shelter. (It looks like you are going to be the only people deemed “criminal” enough to be exiled to the surface) You saw this coming.\n\nThat’s the second time you anticipated events and did nothing, you could kick yourself.\n\nHowever there’s still the question of them trying to MAKE you leave, you are the one that owns the gun after all and not one person has ever dared to try to take it from you. You decide to start working out on a regular basis just in case.\n\n\nThat day comes soon, when a couple people attempt to wrestle it from you, fortunately you’ve been expecting that, you end up shooting them both dead. People are really starting to hate you now, threats are being made that if you and your family don’t leave, then not you, but Nina and Jack are going to suffer the consequences.\n\nYou respond with a similar threat of your own that if anything happens to either of them that you’re going on a postal shooting spree starting with everyone’s kids and won’t stop until you’re out of bullets, and then you’ll fuck up the central computer that powers everything in the shelter. Given your past, people believe you too. People stop harassing you and Nina, but they still “shun” you 99 percent of the time.\n\nIt doesn’t matter though since as more years go by there’s even less room in the shelter, and less supplies, now you’re not even charge of the computer system anymore and it’s barely being run properly by Todd and Charles. Things are starting to break down again. You’re seriously starting to think about leaving the shelter voluntarily.\n\n“Nina, let’s leave. Surely there’s gotta be something better out there. I mean staying here is like waiting to die. We gotta get out of this place.”\n“But what about Jack? I mean we’re going into unknown territory here. Things could be dangerous up there.”\n“It probably will be dangerous, but what the hell we’ve been living in an enclosed space with a bunch of people who hate us for years, and both experienced death attempts. Its not like we’re strangers to it.”\n“Well…shouldn’t we at least stay until the very end?”\n“If we stay until the very end, we might not be getting outta here because by the time everyone’s crammed in so tight with no more supplies or properly functioning equipment, everyone’s going to be panicking and rioting. No, we need to leave while the getting is good. You and Jack start packing up all your vital stuff. I’ll be loading up on some supplies that we might need. We still need to travel light, but make sure you and Jack bring as much water as you can carry.”\n\nSoon you, Nina and Jack are ready to go. Everyone’s wondering what you’re doing and then all eyes are on you when you open the elevator door. You take a moment to address the huddled masses.\n\n“Well we’re leaving now, I’m sure you’re all as glad about it as we will be. Before we leave though I’d just like to say a few things. If any of you fucktards have a lick of sense you’ll abandon this over priced coffin, and coffin is definitely an accurate term with how cramped it’s getting in here. Hell the place is even starting to smell like one, with all the shower break downs. Its like watching something slowly die…hmm I think I saw that show already, when the world got blown to shit years ago. Don’t need to see it again and the first time was more interesting anyway, so enjoy your downward spiral experience losers!”\n\nAnd with that you and your family leave the shelter.\n\nAs you look out before the wilderness in front of you, you can only hope there’s something else out there, but even if there isn’t you know you’ll make it somehow.\n\nYou and your family begin to walk…\n",
  "page 102": "Nah, Nina’s probably right, you might get radiation poisoning or some shit if you go to the surface. Probably nothing left up there for miles anyway. You’re just a little bored and were trying to figure out some way of relieving the boredom and going to the surface isn’t it. You’ll think of something less dangerous. You go back to doing your duties and putting up with Charles and Todd’s chatter.\n\nA few weeks later, Nina tells you she’s pregnant. In nine months your son Jack is born. You also begin to notice how many other babies are being born or on their way of being born, you start to wonder if there will be enough supplies and room if the population keeps growing like this.\n\nOh well surely something will be figured out by then. Still, you do wonder if you shouldn’t have tried harder to convince Nina that it isn’t a completely terrible idea…\n\nFive years pass…\n\nTen years have gone by and the shelter is starting to get a little crowded. After all there isn’t too much to do in the shelter that hasn’t already been done, so sex is always (as it always has been) a popular way to pass the time. The result of that fun activity is too many babies.\n\nAt this point now you say something to Nina about the surface, she’s a little reluctant about the idea, but sees that it might be necessary. Unfortunately the rest of the council doesn’t see it that way. Many of them have been here so long now that going to the surface is almost unthinkable. Despite great protest Nina overrides the council’s advice and goes ahead with the plan anyway. This doesn’t make her too popular.\n\nFor one reason there’s the decision of who is suppose to live on the surface, many people have full blown families now, they’re a little unwilling to risk taking them up. So that means the single or childless people get the boot upstairs since they have less to “lose”. That doesn’t go over too well either. People start protesting loudly about being kicked out of their homes since they have as much right to stay too.\n\nOne day, you’re in the computer room at the time arguing with Charles who happens to be single, and giving you shit about Nina’s new policy. Todd is pretty much indifferent to the idea since even though he’s single he doesn’t mind the idea of going to the surface, he just thinks you should’ve said something to Nina a long time ago to implement this plan sooner before everyone had a whole mess of babies. \n\nThat’s when you get the word.\n\nKyle comes in to tell you that during one of Nina’s speeches William (Who would’ve been one of those kicked up to the surface along with Ron) attempted to assassinate Nina with a scalpel he stole from the medical supplies. Leon managed to stop him with extreme prejudice by breaking his neck. But its not ending there, people are starting to riot and call for someone new to be the shelter leader.\n\nYou’re pissed off now, you storm into the conference room ready to kick everyone’s ass who DARES to try to hurt Nina again. You fire your pistol into the air causing everyone to take notice. When you get over to Nina, she’s pleading for you to not shoot anybody. The assassin was already taken care of, there isn’t any more need for killing.\n\nWhile that might be the case that still doesn’t solve the problem of everyone hating Nina (And probably you too as well) if she gets thrown out of her position, the next step might be to try to throw you guys out of the shelter.\n\nPart of this you feel is your fault, you could just roll the dice here or you could attempt to take the hard line approach.\n",
  "page 223": "Entering the town again, wouldn’t be a good idea. From the sound of it, the town is suspicious of outsiders, if Dan showed up again with the lot of you; they’d know something was up. Not to mention he was the most “presentable” of all of you. You figure the raiders might be a better choice. If they’re poorly led, then maybe just taking care of the leader will make the rest fall in line.\n\n“Alright Dan, you know where the raiders hang out?” you ask.\n“Um, not exactly, but its somewhere in the hills near Cinderville.”\n“Okay let’s go there. We can probably kick the leader’s ass and…”\n\nJim all of sudden stops you in mid-sentence.\n\n\n“Hold up, brain boy. I know you got all these great ideas, and you seem to be a pretty ruthless sonofabitch, and I respect that, but let’s keep in mind that I’M running this fuckin’ gang. Don’t presume you can just order us all around about what we’re going to do.” He tells you in an authoritative voice and implies bodily harm if you disagree with him.\n\n(Sigh) You had a feeling this was going to happen.\n",
  "page 226": "While you probably could kill this fat fucker, but for now you have to have all the help you can get and no disunity to pull this plan off, so you’ll back down for now…\n\n“Hey, I never said I was the leader, I know you are Jim.”\n“Good. Glad we understand each other.”\n“So go ahead and tell us what YOU think is the best course of action for this plan.”\n“Um…well…your strategy sounded pretty good.” Jim says predictably\n\nJust as you thought, you’re STILL in control, just had to give the fool the appearance that he’s still in control.\n\nAfter taking some supplies you think you’ll need and re-trapping your home, you all set off to leave. (You take your van)\n\nIn about a day, you arrive around in the area that Dan was talking about, in fact you don’t need to look for the raiders; they instantly approach you when they see you coming. It would appear some of them have a few vehicles as well. Jim signals for everyone to halt and he gets off his bike. Ramon and Dan halt near Jim, but don’t get off their bikes. You in the meantime grab your hunting rifle and hang in the back a bit, you just hope Jim can pull this shit off, especially since you’re greatly outnumbered.\n\nSoon the raiders arrive and stop their own vehicles. The leader steps out of his beat up car, and steps forward. He looks mean enough, like he’s been living in the wasteland from day one.\n\n“So, you got any last words, before we fuck you and eat you?” he asks Jim.\n“Yeah, I heard you’re the pussy ass bitch, who can’t even handle a few pigs and some fuckin’ vigilantes in Cinderville.” Jim replies.\n\nThe raider leader’s expression gets even meaner looking if such a thing is possible.\n\n“Oh? And I suppose YOU can do a better job you fat tub of shit?” he sneers.\n“Sure the fuck can asshole, all I need is more men. In fact I’d say yours would do just fine, so I’d say you’d better just step aside and see a pro in action.”\n“Don’t think so, besides I’ve already seen a fag get his mouth gang fucked by a bunch of guys.”\n\nYou sure hope Jim is a better fighter, because he’s losing in the battle of snappy comebacks right now. In fact he can’t come up with a response, so he just slugs the raider leader instead. You fully expect the shooting to start, but instead the raider leader laughs, pulls out the biggest blade you’ve ever seen and screams “THIS ONE IS MINE!”\n\nDuring the fight, you scan all your potential greatest threats and the quickest order to pick them off, in case this all goes south. You’re so busy doing that, that you’re not really paying attention to the actual fight, which Jim as it turns out, is winning.\n\nAfter tussling on the ground, slamming into nearby vehicles, punching, kicking and all the rest, Jim finally puts an end to his opponent by shoving his own knife through his throat. Everyone goes silent, and Jim stands up wiping the blood off of himself.\n\n“Alright! Now listen the fuck up! Your previous leader was a lame ass who couldn’t get the job done, and that changes right now! We’re gonna get fuckin’ organized and take that goddamn little town! Might makes fuckin’ right! Are ya with me, or are ya gonna go running off like a limp wristed sissy?”\n\nWell, it’s a good thing you didn’t kill Jim, because these raiders seem to really identify with him and they unanimously accept him as their new leader. You doubt if you would’ve had that success. You’ve never been a people person, regardless of who those people might’ve been, however you are an idea person, and now you move on to your next phase.\n\nAfter Jim finally gets all the new people to listen, you begin to explain your plan, the problem before is they kept stupidly attacking from one direction, rather than doing the classic “pincer” maneuver and attacking from multiple sides. Using Dan’s information, you specifically pick out areas where the most damage can initially be done with the least amount of risk. You point out the spot where there’s still an old school being used to teach the children. Take control of that with the kids inside and you’ve severely reduced most of the townspeople’s willingness to fight, which will curb the neighborhood “Charles Bronsons” from helping the police force. In fact you decide to take that job since you want Jim to lead the raiders in the main direct assault force with the cops. Dan and Ramon will be traveling with their own smaller force to attack other parts of the town, spreading out the cops’ usually organized force. It’s also hoped that the more disreputable elements that Dan mentioned living in the town, will join in the mayhem on your side, or at least against their side.\n\nThe raider vehicles themselves are not in the best condition, and most of them are running low on gas, but they’ll do for now. You figure if all goes well, the still fuel that you created back at your home, as well as the farming area in the town with the pig and cow shit biofuel can solve those problems later. In fact you specifically mention that NO damage should happen to that area in this attack, though you don’t expect them to follow that order.\n\nYou don’t want to wait long to attack with this bunch, since they have the attention span of a gnat of crack. You have to attack soon when they’re all hyped up. You suggest that to Jim, who agrees since he’s anxious to get to this dastardly business anyway. In a couple days you’re attacking the town as planned. You start on your end first, making a beeline to the school, before the main attack force arrives.\n\n\nA few of the raiders are in your van itching to start creating some havoc. You stop outside of the school and run inside with your current trigger happy cohorts. A couple of them kill a few kids and you have to remind them you’re SUPPOSED to be holding them hostage right now! If the townsfolk don’t comply THEN you can start capping the little bastards. You tell them to go and kill the teachers if they want.\n\nIn the mean time you take the opportunity to shout from the window to the crowd gathering outside. You tell them that if any of them start trying to defend the town or help the cops, then their kids are going to be killed. To show you’re really serious though, you tell one of the raiders to toss a kid out the window. A collective cry goes up from the crowd when the body hits the pavement and their pathetic begging is pleasing to your ears.\n\nYou get a few people shooting at you anyway (Obviously not parents) but having a good vantage point and a hunting rifle, you start sniping the idiots who have decided to ignore your threats. A few more kids thrown out the window causes ALL the shooting to stop.\n\nYou can hear the sounds of battle from your position; no cops have arrived so you’re guessing Jim and the rest are doing their job. You’re really enjoying all this chaos you’ve created, you were just stagnating before the bombs dropped, now in this new world you’re free to embrace the darkest part of yourself that always existed, but wasn’t allowed the flourish. You love this fucking shit.\n\nEventually you hear a roar of a motorcycle, followed by the sound of some bottles breaking. You go to check the window and see the crowd outside running and screaming, some of them on fire from the Molotov Cocktails just thrown at them. You also see Ramon shouting up to you.\n\n“Hey! We’re winning man! The remaining cops are barricaded in their fucking station, broke the Mayor’s legs and dragged him through the street and best of all we got some of the other local punks to join us! There’s practically no more resistance left! Its total fucking anarchy man!”\n\nYou turn around and begin smiling at the kids you’re holding hostage which somehow scares them even more. You pick up a young girl and kiss her hard on the lips and laugh at the fear in her eyes. You then throw her down and tell the raiders with you they can do whatever they want, because you’re going to indulge in some pure havoc on your own.\n\nAfter a couple days and nights of indulging in this activity, Jim finally gets around to settling his new gang down (Which he’s inventively called “Jim’s Reapers”) and wondering about what to do with the town now that he has control over it. He seems to have forgotten already that it was YOU, who orchestrated this. Now that the task has been accomplished perhaps this would be the time to discuss the leadership role again.\n\nThen again, you wonder if you even want to bother. Sure there’s the power and such, but there’s also the headache of dealing with all these morons on a regular basis and running the town. The “fun” part is over as it were.\n",
  "page 104": "You said nothing when you should have about the surface five years ago. That was your fault. You can do something now though. Something unpopular and drastic, but something that will better ensure the safety of your family.\n\n“Alright, I’m doing something I should’ve done a long time ago! I’M taking over!”\n“You? Says who?! What gives you the right?!” someone in the crowd shouts.\n\nYou point your pistol in his direction.\n\n“THIS! Is what gives me the fuckin’ right bitch! My willingness to allow you to continue your goddamn existence! Now here’s how things are gonna go down.”\n\nYou begin to implement new changes whether anyone likes them or not, and most folks don’t, but as usual you don’t give a shit.\n\nYou keep Nina’s plan for the surface idea, one of the things you do is install another call button so the elevator can now go up and down without all the extra hassle of fucking with the computer anymore, you still don’t know what the fuck GZS was thinking about with that idea of fucked up engineering. Parts of the shelter begin to get stripped along with some of the vehicles still remaining outside to create a few small homes.\n\nAs for who is going up to live, you devise a random numbering system that everyone has to participate in…of course you’ve purposely rigged it so your family doesn’t have to live up there. You’ve also rigged it so certain “useful” members don’t have to live up there either making them a little more receptive to your changes. Charles and some others are suddenly pleasant with you again. Naturally everyone who does have to leave hates your guts.\n\nYour next step is to send out “explorers” to go find other communities to contact and trade with, because you desperately need more supplies. You pick Leon for the task, but Todd also volunteers. Brenda wants to go too, but you need all the people with medical knowledge here in the shelter.\n\nA few weeks later Leon and Todd come back from their explorations. They mention they came across a place called Ashtown. They say it’s a small town, but willing to trade since they have routine problems with raiders and wouldn’t mind a supply of fresh water for a change.\n\nNina doesn’t exactly approve of your methods, but she goes along with you, because she loves you and you’re actually getting something accomplished.\n\nFive more years pass...\n\nThings have changed quite a bit, for better and for worse.\n\nYou’re running the shelter and its now above town called “Exile” basically by yourself and its putting you on edge each and everyday. One thing you didn’t think about when finding a trading partner, was the fact that more weapons might be coming in. You now aren’t the only person here with a gun. Which has lessened your intimidation value a bit, but you’ve countered a full blown rebellion by turning the “sheltered” and the “unsheltered” against each other. The people who live in the shelter are of course a lot more well off and healthier, while those living on the surface now suffer from the elements and the occasional mutant wolf pack attack.\n\nThe haves vs. the have nots. It’s an old tale that’s been played over and over. A tale that resulted in Armageddon, and now apparently even beyond it.\n\n\nBut even you cannot prevent an unstable powder keg from exploding forever and one day it does. Full blown rioting breaks out, you attempt to squash the rebellion, but it’s not even a rebellion so much as it is full blown anarchy as people IN the shelter are attempting to kill you in the opportunity to attempt to take over. Damn, you really thought Leon was on your side too.\n\nYou end up having to shoot your way out of the conference room, and make it back to your room where Nina is barricaded with Jake, she opens the door long enough to let you in.\n\n“We have to get out of here!” she screams. “It’s over! They’re gonna kill us!”\n",
  "page 225": "“Y’know what, you’re right Jim, you shouldn’t have to take orders from me.”\n“Good, I’m glad we understand each other.”\n“That’s why you won’t be around to do it any longer!”\n\nBefore anyone can do anything, you draw your pistol and shoot Jim three times in the chest before he falls dead. Ramon and Dan look like they want to react, but don’t.\n\n“Good. Glad to see you guys are smarter than you appear. Now Dan, lead us to the raiders.”\n\nAfter taking some supplies you think you’ll need and re-trapping your home, you all set off to leave. (You take your van)\n\nIn about a day, you arrive around in the area that Dan was talking about, in fact you don’t need to look for the raiders; they instantly approach you when they see you coming. It would appear some of them have a few vehicles as well, you just hope you can pull this off.\n\nYou get out of your van and your two new lackeys stop their bikes, they don’t like the looks of this, especially since you’re greatly outnumbered.\n\n“Hey, uh…maybe this isn’t such a good idea…” Ramon says.\n“Yeah, when I was in Cinderville, I heard these guys could get pretty crazy.” Dan adds.\n“Pfft, these types always fall in line when you display sufficient strength. All I gotta do is challenge the leader to hand to hand combat or some shit. Hell, you fuckers were in prison, you know how this works.” You arrogantly reply.\n“Yeah, but even in prison there were rules! I mean there ain’t no rules at all out here! Who says they’re going to accept your challenge?”\n\nWith Dan’s last statement, you figure you’ll soon find out when the raiders arrive and stop their own vehicles. The leader steps out of his beat up car, and steps forward. He looks mean enough, like he’s been living in the wasteland from day one.\n\n“So, you got any last words, before we fuck you and eat you?” he asks.\n“Yeah, I heard you’re the lame cocksucker, who can’t even handle a few pigs and some wannabe vigilantes in Cinderville.” You reply.\n\nThe raider leader’s expression gets even meaner looking if such a thing is possible.\n\n“Oh? And I suppose YOU can do a better job?” he sneers.\n“Sure the fuck can, all I need is more people. In fact I’d say yours would do just fine, so are you going to step down from your inept leadership, or am I gonna have to beat the shit outta you and take it?”\n\nAfter looking at you up and down, he speaks again.\n\n“Shit, I doubt if you could even last five minutes. Fuck this; I’m not wasting my time. Kill these assholes.”\n\nAs soon as he says those words, you immediately turn to run, ducking and trying to get into your van, but in the shooting, the raiders hit the van’s front tires by the time you make it inside. Dan and Ramon speed off, with some of the raiders in pursuit, while you attempt to drive in reverse and turn around on flat tires.\n\nThe raider leader rams your van with his own car, which has been fitted with extra plating. Eventually in the mayhem of the ramming, shooting and swerving around on flat tires on an incline, you roll the van over and over down the hill. It’s amazing that you don’t get killed and the van didn’t blow up.\n\nYou however aren’t in such great shape. You barely manage to crawl from your wrecked van, and when you do, the raider leader arrives in his own car just in time to finish you off.\n\nHe finds you crawling on the ground, when he opens up his door to point a sawed off shotgun in your face and pull the trigger.\n",
  "page 107": "“I’ll go with that idea, but we’re gonna have to be quick! Grab only the basic necessities. We’re going to Ashtown.”\n\n You and your family grab what you need and run for the elevator which fortunately is still on the bottom. A couple of guards still loyal accompany you. When you arrive to the surface you nearly get your head blown off as soon as the elevator door opens. Your guards shoot the would be killer and you all move on.\n\nOutside the shelter entrance it’s even worse. There’s fighting all over the place, and as soon as people see you, they all start trying to kill you. You urge Nina and Jack to run for the wilderness immediately. You fire back at the angry mob moving on your position, while running at the same time. The last of your guards go down. You run to attempt to catch up to Nina and Jack, which you do, but the mob is still chasing you. A bullet whizzes by your ear and then you hear a scream, its Nina.\n\nYou turn around and think she’s been hit, but it was Jack who was hit. She goes back to retrieve his body. Of course the mob isn’t stopping.\n\n“NINA! NO!” you shout and fire at the mob, but killing a few of them doesn’t stop them from shooting Nina, who falls by Jake’s body. There’s nothing you can do now. You continue to run until you eventually lose your pursuers. Then you weep for the loss of your family.\n\nYou wander the wasteland for a bit, hoping something will attack you and put you out of your misery, but you never encounter a thing. Eventually you make your way to Ashtown. You get a couple of strange looks. A few people from Ashtown have heard descriptions of you, but never actually met you in person.\n\n“Aren’t you…”\n“No, not at all, you got any work around in this dump?”\n\n\nThe citizens of Ashtown have a few old generators that they need working at maximum efficiency, so that’s what you work on. They’re so grateful for your technical expertise, that they keep quiet about you being here, the next time a group of people from the shelter come to trade. Things don’t look like they’re going to well at the shelter from what you can tell though, word has it, that they’re going to have to completely abandon the shelter itself and live completely on the surface now, apparently the shelter’s computer system was severely damaged and is libel to shut down at any moment. The people are miserable and the baby mortality rate is high\n\nThis gives you no joy however, you’ve lost more. Much more. The solitude you once cherished and have again now only feel like emptiness. One day during a raider attack you purposely go out and fight them along with all the other defenders. You get yourself shot in the stomach and you don’t even care as you lie dying, anything to end your suffering.\n",
  "page 228": "The whole point of this endeavor was to take control of the town and you’re not going to let Jim get that glory. You go find him in the Mayor’s Manor still tormenting the mayor and his wife. The mayor is currently lying on the floor bloody and helpless with his legs a useless mess. His wife is naked in a fetal position in a corner just rocking to herself in a state of perpetual shock, its apparent she’s been raped over and over. Jim doesn’t have anyone else with him, not even have Dan or Ramon, he’s all by himself in a drunken stupor at the moment celebrating his new found power, unaware that you’re about to relieve him of it.\n\n“Heeeeey! Killer! Its you! Have a drink! This fucker’s got some classy shit stashed in his cellar! (Hic!)”\n“Nah, that’s okay. So I see you’ve been having fun eh?”\n“Me? Oh fuck yeah! The mayor over here has got himself one fine piece of ass! Been tryin’ her out every other hour y’know what I mean? HAR HAR HAR!”\n“Hmmm, yes.” You say looking over at her again, while Jim continues to pontificate.\n“Shit man (Hic!) I think me, you, Dan and fuckin’ Ramon are the few straight bastards in this gang! Those fuckin’ raiders we recruited? I ain’t even seen them try to get any of the pussy in this town. They must’ve been in the wasteland too damn long or somethin’, I think they forgot what a god (hic!) damn bitch looks like. Been cornholin’ each other so much they went an’ fell in love! HAR HAR HAR HAR! (hic!) Ah hell I’m not judgin’. (hic!)”\n\nWhile Jim wanders into the next room still talking about his gang’s sexual preference, you go over to the mayor who’s been baring his mental and physical pain in silence the whole time. When you crouch near him and pull your pistol out, he thinks this is it, but you have something “special” in mind. You see that his hands are still in good shape so you keep your voice down and look him in the eyes.\n\n“You’re gonna die. Nothing can stop this. Resign yourself to this fact. Life sucks and that’s all there is to it.” you say unloading your pistol, but keeping one bullet in the chamber.\n\n“…however, you can still get vengeance. I thought you might like to know that I’m the one who planned this attack. I’m the one who orchestrated this town’s destruction. A town you no longer have any control over and has had many of its citizens viciously killed thanks to my actions… the fat piece of drunken shit in the next room has personally beaten you and violated your wife, repeatedly. Over and over. In front of you. His fat smelly flesh all over her while he enjoyed it the whole time. Probably shoved his cock in all three holes too huh?”\n\nHe looks at you with a mixture of fear, hate, and sorrow, while tears fill his eyes. You place the gun in his hand.\n\n“…well anyway, there’s one bullet in the gun. Remember, you got one shot, one chance for vengeance, make your choice. Better hide that, here comes Jim.”\n\nJim comes stumbling back in room, while the mayor holds the gun close to himself in a bad attempt to hide it. The stand back waiting to see what happens next.\n\n“…I mean hell I’ve fucked a few prags when I (hic!) was in prison, but…hey…what have you got there?” Jim asks seeing the mayor holding something, but not able to make it out clearly due to his inebriated state.\n\nJim gets closer, closer, and then mayor draws on him. He sobers up just long enough to realize he’s got a bullet between his eyes.\n\n“…what the fuuuuuuuuck…” Jim says before falling face first on the floor.\n\n“Wow, that was pretty intense, I mean my own life was on the line there! Whew! But I figured you’d kill Jim, too bad it wasn’t the right choice on your part.” You say punching the mayor in the face and take your pistol back, loading it again.\n\n“Stupid bastard, didn’t it occur to you that I’d do the same thing to your wife?”\n“No…don’t…” he says looking up at you with blood coming from his mouth, as your own curls cruelly upward.\n“Just kidding, I wouldn’t stick my dick anywhere near Jim has been. Looks like you made the right choice after all!”\n\nYou put the mayor out of his misery and shoot him in the face. You then approach the mayor’s wife who’s still been rocking to herself this whole time. You look at her a little closer.\n\n“Hmm, you must’ve been very beautiful before this all happened.” You remark, caressing her damaged face, before ending her life as well.\n\nHaving had your fun, you go and announce you’re the leader now. Unfortunately you don’t quite have the charisma or imposing physique Jim had, so not everyone is willing to follow. (Ramon and Dan are among the first ones you kill for disobeying you) What ultimately happens is the town becomes a factional warzone where nobody is really in control and the poor Cinderville townsfolk are caught in the middle. Eventually things stabilize and a few of the “heavy weights” carve out their own territories and there’s an unstable peace in the town. Fights still break out, but there’s never an imbalance of power or advantage for long. (Though, maintaining a hold on the biofuel refinery gives you a little bit of an advantage…)\n\nFour years pass…\n\nFive years have passed since the bombs dropped and you couldn’t be happier. You’ve accomplished more than you ever did in the old world. World War Three was the best thing that ever happened to you. You’ve been running your own slice of heaven in this hellish world and had the freedom to live out your true nature, which you’ve done for the past five years.\n\nAnd now that freedom could be coming to an end.\n\nRecently through rumors and wandering travelers who have the misfortune of finding Cinderville, you’ve found out that there’s a growing organization trying to “tame” the wasteland. They call themselves The Combine. Apparently they’re at war with another organization called the Cybernetic Collective and the Combine’s been aggressively taking towns and conscripting the citizens to fight in their war. And now they’ve come to Cinderville.\n\nThey arrive in well taken care of vehicles, with better training, better discipline and better weapons. They begin talking to everybody they can. They aren’t going to take the entire town by force, no what they intend to do is to back one of the stronger factions to wipe out the rest, and then absorb their puppet into the Combine to have control over the entire town. You’re not fooled.\n\nThe question just remains is; are you going to ally with them first, or fight this threat to your freedom?\n",
  "page 106": "“NEVER! I’M the one who saved this shelter from its own idiocy! If it wasn’t for me, this place everyone would probably still be living crammed together like fuckin’ sardines! They WILL fall in fuckin’ line!\n\nUnfortunately like most people under a dictatorship, they don’t see you as a great savior but rather as the tyrant you are. Eventually a group of the surface people come down en-masse and overrun the place, you try to prevent more from coming by barricading yourself in the computer room and shutting off the elevator, but its too late, there are already a lot of them down here. There’s no way you can fight all of them, you don’t have the ammo and all your loyal guards are dead. You and your family are trapped and you know what they’ll do to all of you if they take you alive, you look at Nina and Jack…\n\nNope, you’re still in control of some things around here. You take a deep breath and look directly into Nina’s eyes.\n\n“Know that I always loved you…the both of you.” you say sadly.\n\nThen without any further hesitation you shoot them both in the head.\n\nAfter wiping a tear from your eye, you start paying attention to the threats outside your door.\n\n“Get outta there you sonofabitch! It’s over! You and your fuckin’ family are through!”\n“Oh yeah?! We’ll see who’s fuckin’ through you ungrateful bastards! If I’m going down, you’re all coming to fuckin’ hell with me! SCORCHED FUCKIN’ EARTH BITCHES!”\n\nYou start shooting the GZS central computer, lighting starts flickering and eventually you hit the right vital spot and the entire shelter’s power goes dead. Immediately you hear some shouting from behind the door, and they begin blasting it open. Won’t be long now.\n\n\nYou fire at the first figure that you can barely make out in the darkness, then the rest open fire on you. You see the flash of multiple muzzle blasts and then fall to the ground near Nina’s body.\n\nIn your last moments, you grab onto Nina’s hand and squeeze before darkness takes you.\n",

You curse yourself for reconnecting back to the system, you knew someone was doing some shit like this; you just had the wrong person.\n\nYou make sure to take your pistol, you have no idea what the outside world is like now, but you’re sure you’re going to need it. As you hear the elevator slowly reach the bottom you fill up a couple of your empty bottles with water, you hope you’ll have enough to last you.\n\n“I sure hope you’re ready, because the elevator is.” Miranda says.\n“Yeah, okay, okay!” you answer and get in the elevator, which begins to ascend.\n\nYour current state of mind is a mixture of fear and anxiousness. Part of you begins to wonder if it won’t be so bad on the surface, after all…then the elevator suddenly stops and doesn’t continue, your fear begins to overwhelm you completely when you hear Miranda’s menacing voice again.\n\n“Well I’m glad you had the intelligence to take a gun with you, it should certainly save you from the slow death that occurred to Shadow when I trapped him in the elevator. I’ll inform Becky you said goodbye.”\n\nYou scream out, but there is no one to help you. You’ve effectively been trapped in an even worse situation than you were before. There isn’t any service access, there’s no panel you can pry open, even the solid steel door is a single piece that slides one way. You wouldn’t be able to pry it open even if you had the strength to do so. You’re doomed and you know it.\n\nMiranda was right; there isn’t any point in prolonging the inevitable. You take your gun, hold it to your head and close your eyes…\n",

You leave to go back to your home, a few days later Jim comes by asking you why you left, and you explain, you’re a loner by nature and just want to live in solitude for the most part. If you ever desire to go raise some hell, you’ll visit Cinderville and bust some heads or something. Jim says he gets it and says you’ll always be welcome in Cinderville, as long as you don’t get in his way running the place\n\nYou tell him that won’t be a problem, and then you quickly shove a knife in his throat. Jim gives you a surprised look for a brief second, clutches at his bloody throat, lets out a gurgled hiss and dies. You drag his body inside and chop it up to make a new totem to put outside. You half expect someone to come looking for their new fearless leader, but nobody does, presumably someone else attempted to fill the power vacuum, actually several people did. (Ramon and Dan were among the first to try and fail miserably) Cinderville descends into a chaotic place of constant strife and you go back to waylaying travelers. Though sometimes you take a trip to Cinderville when you want to be “social”, but it’s mostly to better hone your survival skills, though you also take the opportunity to sadistically murder some of the poor original inhabitants of Cinderville who’s lives have become a living hell now. It’s like you created your own personal “gym”.\n\nFour years pass…\n\nFive years have passed since the bombs dropped and you’ve enjoyed yourself more or less since it’s happened, you have complete independence and freedom to do whatever you want, but as always all things do come to an end.\n\nDuring your trips to the Cinderville, you’ve heard  about some new organization called The Combine, attempting to “tame” the wasteland. It seems they’re in some sort of war with another organization called the Cybernetic Evolution. From what you heard, neither one seems to be a shining beacon of light in this dark world, and that sort of reassures you too. It means that civilization won’t be making a come back anytime soon, however it also means they’ve both been scouring the wasteland for recruits, neither one really asking for permission either. Eventually The Combine arrives in Cinderville. They quickly subdue the disorganized rabble there and place the town under their thumb. Indeed the original inhabitants are happy to put up with the totalitarianism of the Combine after the years of mindless chaos.\n\nThe Combine being the paramilitary organization it is, tends to do a lot of scouting and exploration, so you know its only a matter of time before they find you and chances are that they’re not going to leave you alone.\n",
  "page 56": "Bullshit. While Miranda undoubtedly has control of some of your systems, if she had complete control, she wouldn’t even be giving you a chance for survival with as obsessed as she obviously is. She would’ve just disconnected your food and water dispenser and taunted you before leaving you to die, or even just waited for you to enter one of your other rooms and then sealed the door to trap you. Actually she would’ve sealed the door to the computer room if she was so worried about you disconnecting. In any case if you get in that elevator you’re most assuredly at her mercy, what’s keeping her from stopping the elevator midway through as you’re going up?\n\nYou’re sure if you just go to the computer room, you could disconnect and that would be the end of this.\n\n“Alright Miranda, let me pack some things.”\n“Yeah yeah, hurry up, the Elevator will be here soon, and you better be finished packing your shit when it…HEY WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU’RE GOING!!!”\n\nYou run to the computer room while Miranda shouts more threats at you, and turns the lights off.\n\n“I warned you! Don’t you dare try to disconnect, this Shelter will be your fucking tomb! Here’s a fucking virus shithead!”\n\n\nYou stumble around in the dark as you rip out all your connection lines again and then forcefully pull out the mainline destroying the attachment. Miranda’s voice disappears and you’ve stopped her.\nHowever you still need to get things back to normal again, so you immediately turn your computer on and start doing a system diagnostic, after all you weren’t completely idle during those years of isolation. You read books on electronics in your private library and the Shelter handbook cover to cover, not to mention had lengthily conversations with it about some of its systems (Though you wish you’d paid a little more attention). You begin delving into the inner the workings of the Shelter’s controls.\n\nAfter some scanning, Miranda really fucked up some of your shit. You manage to get the lights on again, but lots of files were corrupted due to her hacking. The AI is damaged, you doubt if it’ll be talking to you again anytime soon. You’re going to have to spend a lot of time working on things just to get them right again…its funny, but you realize you could finish bringing the elevator down and leave if you wanted to. You don’t know why you didn’t think to do this before, but then again things were a little different when the Shelter was actually talking to you. It didn’t feel right to go hacking into the Shelter while it was attempting to be your friend.\n",
  "page 59": "You’re not about to abandon your home, besides the surface is probably still unsafe who know what the hell awaits you up there. You begin working on fixing things starting with the water controls. Apparently Miranda was trying to turn off your dispenser, but only succeeded in turning off the water to your bathroom facilities.\n\nAbout five hours in, your lighting goes out again. You’re about to check it, then they come back on. You then hear the TV turn on by itself, with nothing but static. When you leave the computer room to see what’s going on personally, the door slams shut. Then water dispenser turns on and leaks water all over the floor for awhile and then ceases. You go over to check it and your heart stops when you can’t get it work. The food one doesn’t work either. You begin to panic and then the door to the computer room opens up again.\n\nSeizing the opportunity you run back in to fix whatever the hell is suddenly turning your shelter haywire, when on the computer screen you see in big letters.\n\n\n*VIRUS ENACTED! ERROR! ERROR! TOTAL SYSTEM SHUT DOWN!*\n\nYou try to do something, but the hard drive is now completely fucked and all you get is error messages constantly appearing all over the screen. Miranda managed to send her virus before you could disconnect and though it took awhile, it’s finally taking effect now, spectacularly.\n\nThe lighting goes out, the room door slams shut, the computer screen goes black and you’re left in complete darkness and silence with no hope whatsoever. Miranda’s threat has come true and this Shelter has become your tomb. Now you’re left to die a slow lingering death.\n\nIt doesn’t do any good to scream, but you do anyway.\n",

You access the elevator controls (One of the few things working right and undamaged) and call the elevator to continue it’s decent.\n\nYou go back to your room and pack up all the things you brought with you when you first got here. You didn’t even need most of the stuff, but maybe you will above ground. You then go to the water dispenser which is thankfully still working and fill up to empty bottles with water.\n\nThe elevator door finally opens up and you put your bag to block the door from closing and head back to the computer room where you access the system to tell the elevator to go back up and then run back to the elevator where you gather your bag and enter.\n\nOn the ride up you get a little nervous and even fearful. Not so much of what might await you on the surface, but of hoping the damn elevator doesn’t suddenly stop, fortunately that doesn’t happen and you eventually reach the ground once again. The door opens and you enter the same foyer you arrived in five years ago. Same ATM like machine is there, except its screen is flashing a single message at you.\n\n*NO REFUNDS*\n\n“No shit.” You mutter and take a deep breath before opening the door to the outside.\n\nYou see a bright light, but of course it’s only the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it really could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren’t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you’d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it’s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. On a lark you take out your long unused van keys and try to start it up, naturally it doesn’t even make a noise.\n\n“Looks like I’m walking.”\n\nAs you make you way down the empty road you see some smoke in the distance. Civilization perhaps? Not knowing where else to go, you head that way.\n\nYou’re not sure of what to expect, but it’ll be better than the eternal boredom you would’ve faced while still in the Shelter.\n\nYou’re not too worried, you got your gun.\n",
  "page 51": "No, you’re not going to risk it. For all you know Shadow’s already hacked everyone else’s shelter and has been waiting patiently for you to return one day. You’re not falling for it. You’ll have to find something else to do though to occupy your time though, you figure as long you keep your mind occupied with something new, you won’t get too bored. Twiddling your thumbs isn’t going to cut it.\n\nIt occurs to you that maybe you should invent a hobby of some sort. You’ve read a lot on electronics in the shelter library, as well as the handbook cover to cover in your five years here, maybe you could tinker with some shit to make it more efficient.\n\nThere’s the other option which you didn’t think you’d ever think about and that’s actually leaving the Shelter.

I must admit I was starting to worry about your mental state. In fact I was going to suggest you do just that, but I thought that it may upset you.”\n\nYou go into your computer room and reconnect your system.

Walking dead as it were.\nMissKitty25: So you still talking to the voices in your head…I mean your Shelter?\nOmegaMan23: Well I tend to alternate between the two and they’re all still more interesting than you. So much for being civil.\nRockerChick20: Oh be nice Miranda! We don’t have too many others to talk to anymore, I’m sure Omega’s not here to cause trouble again.\nOmegaMan23: I wasn’t trying to cause trouble the first time…Miranda?\nMissKitty25: Yeah while you were gone, we all opened up a lot more and actually learned each other’s real names. Guess your paranoia was contagious.\nRockerChick20: Hey I wanted us to use the cameras right from the beginning, so I wasn’t paranoid! Anyway since you’re back, my real name’s Becky. What’s yours? Oh wait turn on your camera! Everyone’s seen each other now!\nOmegaMan23: Wait a minute. You said you don’t have too many others to talk to anymore, what did you mean?\nRockerChick20: Oh. Well that’s a bit sad actually. Not too long after you left, Paul or Casey Jones as you probably remembered him, said his food dispensers had failed. He said he couldn’t get them to work at all, soon his water dispenser failed too. He couldn’t even get his bathroom taps to work. He knew he didn’t have much time left after that, so he logged on one last time to tell us all good bye and said he’d spare us the agony of having to speak to him knowing that was slowly dying of starvation and dehydration…I don’t really like to think about it.\nOmegaMan23: Shit, that’s a fucked up way to go. So um, what happened to Job?\nMissKitty25: You mean Mark? Don’t know exactly, but he stopped logging on about a couple years ago and given that he was on here whenever he could, it’s safe to say nothing good happened to him. He did say he was having power problems though the last time he was on, we all figured it was just his usual panicking over minor Shelter glitches, but it might’ve been serious this time. Of course maybe he’s still alive and he’s just lost network power and he just can’t access us, but for all his stressing, he was a pretty good mechanic and electronics guy, so it seems like he would’ve fixed the problem by now. Don’t know. Kind of glad not to hear him whine anymore though.\nOmegaMan23: Alright, I hesitate to ask, but where’s Shadow?\nRockerChick20: Xavier? About three months after Job disappeared. Miranda told me he sent her a message saying he was leaving his Shelter Said he wasn’t going rot in a glorified coffin anymore and was going to take his chances back on the surface.\nOmegaMan23: So Shadow was a guy eh? How the hell did he leave his Shelter? There’s no way to call the elevator back down!\nMissKitty25: Maybe he had a different kind of Shelter set up, or he just climbed up the shaft or something. Who cares? He was an asshole anyway. So is this a temporary visit or do you intend on sticking around?\nRockerChick20: You should stick around; it gets kind of lonely with just me and Miranda, if you turn on your camera we could do something together!\nMissKitty25: You better not be implying what I think you are Becky, that’s just between me and you.\nRockerChick20: Well you don’t have to join in then, you’ve been acting like a domineering bitch lately anyway.\nMissKitty25: Oh so that’s what this is all about? Some guy comes around and you’re all ready to fucking drop everything and suck his dick?\nRockerChick20: Suck his…what the hell? It’s fucking cyber, it doesn’t mean anything, it’s just a good way to pass the time, plus I’d like to do it with a GUY in some fashion again, seeing as you probably ran Shadow off before anything even happened!\nMissKitty25: So MY feelings and all those private chats we had meant nothing to you?! You don’t have any feelings for me?! Don’t you LOVE me?!\nRockerChick20: Well yeah I do to a degree, but I mean come on it’s really not the same. I mean maybe it would be different if we could actually touch each other and stuff, but…\nMissKitty25: FUCK YOU!\n\nMiranda suddenly logs off, and Becky does likewise leaving you shaking your head at the whole situation.\n",

Besides I was interested in some of that stuff you were talking about yesterday.\nRockerChick20: Oh really? Well let’s make this private, just in case Miranda decides to show up. I mean…I’m sorry she got all attached and stuff, but I can do what the hell I want you know? I mean it’s the world is dead! Shouldn’t I be able to grab as much fun as I can?\nOmegaMan23: You’re not getting any arguments from me.\nRockerChick20: Okay, well hopefully Miranda gets over it; I still think it would be fun for all of us together. Now turn on your camera and tell me your name finally!\n\nYou both go into private mode where you see Becky and she finally sees you. Fortunately you both seem to find each other attractive, then after telling her your name, you start cybering. It’s definitely not the same as the real thing, but you have a really good imagination and a naked chick talking dirty to you while touching herself is better than nothing!\n\nYou and Becky do this quite a bit in the passing weeks, while learning a little bit more about each other. Every now and then you see Miranda come online briefly, but then quickly logs off whenever she realizes you and Becky are in a private “discussion”. You’ve also realized you haven’t heard the Shelter talk to you like in normally does. It usually says at least good morning to you, but it’s been silent for some time. You don’t think too much of all this until one day you wake up to a voice much different than the one that the Shelter has.\n\n“You dreaming about Becky, motherfucker? Yeah I bet you are! You hear me? Get the fuck up I got something to tell your sorry ass!”\n“What the fuck? Shelter?”\n“No, it ain’t your fucking Shelter talking to you! I always thought you were lying about that, but apparently you weren’t seeing as I had to disable the Shelter’s voice program which does make it more convenient to tell this to you. I guess honesty is one of your few redeeming qualities; of course stealing someone’s love isn’t though right? You fucked up big time pal!”\n“Well I can only assume this is Miranda.”\n“You assume right fucktard. While you and Becky were having fun, I was accessing your\nShelter’s systems.”\n\nSuddenly all your lights go out and then go back on. You also see the TV come on and see an angry looking woman on the screen.\n\n\n“You see that? You got you by the fucking balls bitch! If I want I can shut this whole thing down and make it your fucking tomb just like I did with Casey and Job. Maybe you’ll be smart like Shadow and leave the fucking Shelter, because it’s your only chance for survival at this point.”\n“What the…so wait. Can’t we talk about this?”\n“No there ain’t any fucking talking! Becky is MINE, you fucking hear me? Everything was perfect, until you decided to show up again and steal her away! Shit, you’re lucky I’m even giving you the option of living! Don’t think about attempting to disconnect or anything else, I’m watching you and can detect your every move. Your only options are to leave or DIE!”\n“But…how? How am I supposed to do that?! The elevator’s at the top and there’s no call button!”\n“I told you I have complete access to your systems, I’m going to bring the elevator down, and you can pack up your shit and get ready to leave. I suggest you do it quickly, because I’m not going to give you much time.”\n\nSounds pretty final.\n",

I just needed to remind myself of the benefits of solitude! I’m gonna go watch Scarface again!”\n\nWell you found your routine to stave off insanity. You retreat into solitude once again without thinking anymore of it, then every so often you reconnect briefly and stir shit up between Becky and Miranda then disconnect again. You don’t think about leaving the Shelter (Even if you could) seeing as you’ve found a way to cope with your situation, and there’s always the Shelter itself to talk to which is never as “friendly” to you again for some reason. (Perhaps it disapproves of you acting like a dick)\n\nAs the years go by you eventually die of an embarrassing shower accident by getting soap in your eyes and then slipping and cracking your skull on the sink while attempting to reach for a towel.\n\nDetecting your demise, the Shelter powers down.\n",
  "page 110": "No, you better just keep it to yourself. You don’t want Nina getting pissed at you, you know how high strung she’s able to get sometimes. Besides the population isn’t growing that much yet, there are plenty of supplies. If someone gets the idea that going to the surface is necessary, you’re sure that someone else will bring it up. No point in you getting in trouble. You go back to sleep and just hope Charles and Todd keep quiet about your little excursion to the surface.\n\nA few weeks later you find out Nina’s pregnant, now you start to wonder about having enough room in the future. You still don’t bring it up, because you don’t want to upset Nina anymore in her “condition”.\n\nAfter Jack is born, the surface thing is still in the back of your mind, but now it’s been so long, you just feel it’s easier not to address it to Nina. So you don’t say anything.\n\nFive years pass…\n\nTen years have passed and the shelter is starting to get a little crowded. After all there isn’t too much to do in the shelter that hasn’t already been done, so sex is always (as it always has been) a popular way to pass the time. The result of that fun activity is too many babies.\n\nAt this point now you say something to Nina about the surface, she’s a little reluctant about the idea, but sees that it might be necessary. Unfortunately the rest of the council doesn’t see it that way. Many of them have been here so long now that going to the surface is almost unthinkable. Despite great protest Nina overrides the council’s advise and goes ahead with the plan anyway. This doesn’t make her too popular.\n\nFor one reason there’s the decision of who is suppose to live on the surface, many people have full blown families now, they’re a little unwilling to risk taking them up. So that means the single or childless people get the boot upstairs since they have less to “lose”. That doesn’t go over too well either. People start protesting loudly about being kicked out of their homes since they have as much right to stay too.\n\nOne day, you’re in the computer room at the time arguing with Charles who happens to be single, and giving you shit about Nina’s new policy. Todd is pretty much indifferent to the idea since even though he’s single he doesn’t mind the idea of going to the surface, he just thinks you should’ve said something to Nina a long time ago to implement this plan sooner before everyone had a whole mess of babies. \n\nThat’s when you get the word.\n\nKyle comes in to tell you that during one of Nina’s speeches William (Who would’ve been one of those kicked up to the surface along with Ron) attempted to assassinate Nina with a scalpel he stole from the medical supplies. Leon managed to stop him with extreme prejudice by breaking his neck. But its not ending there, people are starting to riot and call for someone new to be the shelter leader.\n\nYou’re pissed off now, you storm into the conference room ready to kick everyone’s ass who DARES to try to hurt Nina again. You fire your pistol into the air causing everyone to take notice. When you get over to Nina, she’s pleading for you to not shoot anybody. The assassin was already taken care of; there isn’t any more need for killing.\n\nWhile that might be the case that still doesn’t solve the problem of everyone hating Nina (And probably you too as well) if she gets thrown out of her position, the next step might be to try to throw you guys out of the shelter.\n\nPart of this you feel is your fault, you could just roll the dice here or you could attempt to take the hard line approach.\n",

It’s well known at this point that it was YOU who caused the attack in the first place, it’s well known you participated in numerous atrocities during the attack; it’s well known that you’d periodically stalk the streets of Cinderville at night like some demented hunter, viciously killing men, women and children.\n\nOne of the only requests that they had for The Combine, was for YOU to be killed. The Combine always being an organization to keep the masses at least happy enough for them not to rebel, agrees to their request. After all you’re a scumbag anyway that would probably still continue to harass the town, the best thing to do IS eliminate you.\n\n\nThey soon arrive in force outside your home.\n\nYou’re well stocked and prepared for a siege though; you figure you’ll be able to hold out long enough before it gets to costly to them and they’ll have to break off their attack, at which point you’ll make your escape.\n\nHowever, they’ve also been informed just how dangerous you are, not to mention they don’t want to waste too much time with you, so after confirming you’re inside (Which they do when you kill one of them attempting to get closer to your front door) they just start bombarding the place with rockets and grenades.\n\nThe entire place is razed to the ground with you in it.\n",

When you come back the entire family seems to have calmed down a bit, you remove the trap from his leg and look at it. You didn’t use anything with blades, so its just broken, not punctured in any way.\n\n“Damn, it’s a good thing I didn’t use that bear trap I found, your leg would’ve been completely severed!

It just ate our debit card and said error! We tried like hell to get in, but the elevator door just wouldn’t budge. When the bombs hit, we were in the shelter entrance foyer, and stayed there for a few days, but we realized we couldn’t stay there forever, so we left and tried to find a nearby town that we might try to continue life as usual, but the one we found was quite unfriendly, they wouldn’t even let us stay! This catastrophic event has made people paranoid and hostile!”\n“Huh. People were like that before the bombs; did you think they’d be different afterwards?” you say.\n\nNow the man speaks again, as he attempts to sit up\n\n“Well I’d at least expect some hospitality. When we got there, they looked at us like we were going to loot the entire town.”\n“Probably thought you were, you know its going to take a while before most folks become trusting again. People are going to barely trust people they know. Hell, I heard they were rioting in the city before the bombs dropped. So I’d imagine there are lots of bad types out there willing to kill people over supplies as simple as fresh water.”\n“But you helped us.”\n“Yeah, I guess I did…”\n“Is this your store? Looks like you were better prepared than we were.”\n“Uh…yeah, okay well I guess you guys can stay out here for awhile until you’re ready to move on. Good luck.”\n\nAs you turn to leave the woman speaks again.\n\n“Hey wait! You mean you’re not going to let us in? You’d just leave us out here? We told you, we were low on gas! And now my husband Jonathan has a broken leg! How are we going to get by?”\n“So, you can drive can’t you? Look, this isn’t my problem. I helped out, because I realized you guys weren’t bandits or some shit, but I’m not here to take care of you. I have my own concerns.”\n“But…”\n“Let it go Doris, I guess we should be grateful he fixed my leg and didn’t kill us.”\n“Are we going to be okay Dad?” the boy asks, speaking up for the first time without yelling.\n“We’ll see Tyler, we’ll see.”\n\nAh fuck, you started to give shit and now it’s coming back at you.\n\nYou turn around, and give in.\n\n“Alright, you can come in, but you’re staying in the topside of the store, you can even stay until your leg heals, but after that, you gotta go.

You just say your “Uncle Billy” gave it to you when he died.\n\nSoon Jonathan’s leg is much better, but you’re wondering if you shouldn’t let them stay on a more permanent basis; however as it turns out, that’s exactly what Jonathan had in mind for his family except YOU weren’t included.\n\nThis treachery for your good graces comes as a surprise one night, when Doris suddenly wakes you up by banging on the trap door, yelling about how she thinks there’s someone out side and how Jonathan went to check, but she thinks he’s in trouble. You immediately grab your shotgun and go see what’s wrong.\n\nYou barely get out the front door, and you’re suddenly hit in the head, knocking you to the ground. Jonathan grabs your shotgun and points it at you. Doris and Tyler come to the doorway.\n\n“Doris, take Tyler down into the underground…this’ll be over soon I hope.” Jonathan replies grimly.\n\nDoris nods and then looks at you, with a sad expression.\n\n“We’re sorry about this…we really are…” she says and then takes her son away leaving just you and Jonathan. You stand up and brush yourself off.\n\n“So, were you planning this all along or what?”\n“Well…I dunno…nowadays, you don’t really plan anything, it just sort of happens y’know?”\n“Oh yeah, I know.”\n“Well you can understand that this is a good place for me and my family, and I can’t allow you to just kick us out.”\n“Stupid bastard, I was just thinking about letting you all stay on a more permanent basis.” you laugh. This response surprises Jonathan, and it almost looks like he’s going to change his mind, but he doesn’t.\n\n“…It’s too late now. You’d never trust me now, and I’d always think you’d try to get revenge. You have to leave. Besides you said it yourself one time, there aren’t an indefinite amount of supplies, to sustain all of us.”\n“Well you might as well pull that goddamn trigger John, because I’m not leaving.”\n“Come on, man I’m serious! I’ll do it. I don’t want to, but  I got a family to think about and there’s nothing that’s gonna make me change my mind…look I’ll let you leave with some supplies. How about that? I mean you can take one of these vehicles or even mine! Just you gotta leave, we’re taking this place now. I’m sorry.”\n\nWell it’s not much of a choice, but it may be more preferable than death. Though you can’t help but think of the irony that how you tried to do the right thing and got fucked in the ass big time, while when you murdered Billy and his wife, you hit the damn jackpot.\n",
  "page 210": "Obviously they thought they could just stroll in and take shelter here, bad mistake on\ntheir part…\n\n\nYou calmly point the shotgun at the man caught in the trap and blast him before he even notices you. The little boy now really begins screaming, but the woman just becomes silent and falls into shock turning her head in your direction covered in the blood of her husband.\n\nYou don’t feel sick like you did last time; you do feel an overwhelming sense of power though.\n\nThe woman grabs her son’s hand and turns to run, but realizes two seconds later that she’s only holding on to his hand and the rest of him is lying on the ground, one arm less, from your second blast.\n\n“WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!” the woman screams.\n“Because I can, and there’s nobody around to stop me.” You say and briskly walk over to the woman. After a pathetic struggle you knock her out and drag her into your new home.\n\nAfter all, you’re not sure when you’ll get to see another woman again…\n\nA couple days after the incident with the family (and disposing of all three bodies) you begin keeping yourself in better shape. You start exercising regularly, and fixing up your home. You need to be prepared, in case more people ever show up. You MUST defend yourself and your home. You don’t get many, but every now and then another poor soul stumbles across your death lair. You’re merciless. Soon you begin to arrange the vehicles of your victims to form a semi “wall” around your home and place some grisly totems as “decoration”.\n\nA year passes…\n\nYou don’t get visitors anymore, though that’s probably because of the unfriendly image you’ve projected with all the skulls you’ve stuck on the spikes outside. Part of you is glad that you aren’t being disturbed anymore, but the other part misses the killing. You begin to wonder if you shouldn’t start venturing out more, but you’d hate to leave your home.\n\nOne day you’re awakened by the roar of motorcycles. You’ve got visitors again, you ready your weapons. As you head upstairs you hear that inevitable “SNAP!” sound followed by screaming. Yet another victim to your traps, though you hear the typical sounds of distress, you also hear some laughter, taunting even, which has got you more curious than anything.\n\nYou check through a little peephole you made and see a bunch of biker types, one is lying on the ground, his leg nearly severed by the hidden bear trap. While one is trying to free him, a couple of the others are just laughing and remarking about how it looks like it really hurts.\n\n“AAAAAARGH! AGHHH!”\n“Look are you assholes going to help or not?” one of them asks.\n“Hey, I told you fuckers not to go traipsing into a place that has skulls stuck on stakes. Y’all should’ve known it wasn’t exactly going to be a friendly place.”\n“We need fuckin’ gas Jim, and this place has a lot of vehicles, and maybe some of them have gas. We had to go check!”\n“Well yeah, but that didn’t mean just walking around unaware of your surroundings…shit that leg looks bad.”\n“GET IT OFF! AAAAHHHH!”\n\n“That leg is bad. Even if you did get it off of him, he’s probably going to lose it to infection. I wiped my own shit on it, not to mention it was developing a nice set of rust on it when I found it.  I’d say his bike riding days are over.” You say standing your doorway with your shotgun ready. The bikers look in your direction, one looks like he’s going to pull his pistol, but the one called Jim stops him. He’s obviously the leader.\n\n“You might be right, stranger, but that still leaves you outnumbered one to three. You sure you wanna take those odds?” Jim says.\n“I’ll take ‘em and I’ll enjoy it. It’s been a long time since I’ve killed a whole mess of people.”\n“Oh, so you’re a REAL killer eh?”\n“Better killer than you.”\n“Hah! I doubt that! See me an’ the boys here have been raisin’ hell where ever we can. Come across a few towns and let’s just say we’re not real welcome there anymore. It’s a brand new world, and only the strong are gonna survive it.”\n“Yeah? Well it looks like one of your flock isn’t so strong now.”\n“Yeah…well you might be right about that stranger…maybe someone should put him out of his misery. Can’t very well ride with one leg, that’d be kind of silly.”\n\nThe biker trying to help speaks up.\n\n“Oh come on Jim man! Clyde here saved all of our asses about a month ago!”\n“Yeah? Well what has he done for us lately? The stranger’s right, we gotta put him down, it’s the kind thing to do really. You gonna do it, Dan?”\n“No…I…mean…well…”\n“Pussy. Nevermind. Ramon you gonna do it?”\n“Shit yeah! Here hold on, oh fuck.” Ramon says pulling out his pistol and then dropping it on the ground. Jim just shakes his head.\n\n“Ramon, its amazing you’ve even lasted this long with your clumsy ass. Fuck it, I’LL do it.”\n",
  "page 213": "“Alright, fine I’ll leave…but you know this isn’t right.” You say backing away.\n“…I know…I know…” he replies.\n\nJonathan calls his wife to get you few days supply of water, and some food. She soon returns with both which are throw at your feet, you take them and head to your van. They aren’t going to give you a weapon though for obvious reasons. They tell you that maybe the town they stopped at before will be friendlier to you and you could try to live there.\n\nYou don’t say anything else, you just go to start up your van and drive off, you aren’t sure where you’re heading, but you figure you’ll take the “friendly advice” of Doris and Jonathan and go to the town they told you about.\n\n You get a few miles and then your van decides to die on you. Nothing’s going your way. After futile attempts to fix it, kicks, and threats, you realize you’re walking now, which wouldn’t be completely bad if you weren’t without some sort of weapon.\n\nWhile walking along the desolate road, a dog like creature appears in the distance, then another, then more. They look like wolves, but something is obviously different about them, like they’re deformed in some way, either way they don’t look friendly, but they do look very hungry.\n\nYou attempt to outrun them, but the mutant wolves are faster, and they ultimately catch you and rip you apart.\n",
  "page 212": "“Fuck you John, I’m not making it that easy for ya. You think it’s really that easy to kill someone? You go right ahead.”\n\nYou’re hoping that you’re just calling his bluff and he really won’t shoot you, whether he was or not, he hesitates long enough for you to take advantage of the situation.\n\nYou dive into Jonathan’s legs as hard as you can, causing the both of you to fall to the ground, he attempts to get you off by smashing you in the head with the shotgun butt, however you knock it from his hands and re-break his leg, this time so the bone comes through. He bellows in pain, and then you kick him in the face.\n\nYou pick up the shotgun and point it at him.\n\n“You stupid motherfucker! I woulda let you stay here! If you’d just…bah! You’re right, it’s too late now, and you fucked…ARGH!”\n\nA shot rings out and a sharp pain shoots into your side, causing you to fall. You look over in the direction of the store and its Doris holding one of the hunting rifles, though it seems she’s not entirely comfortable with it and her second shot misses, giving you time to retaliate.\n\n“Bitch!” you say and swing the shotgun in her direction blowing a hole in her side as well, though hers is instantly fatal.\n\n“DORIS!” Jonathan screams before he crawls in your direction in some vain attempt for revenge.\n\n“Told ya, it’s not that easy to kill someone, unless you’ve done it before…” you remark and finish off Jonathan.\n\nYou’re bleeding profusely and in a lot of pain, and you briefly wonder if you’re going to survive your wounds, but that wonder comes to an end, when another shot rings out, hitting your upper body dropping you. It’s Tyler holding your pistol, silent, with tears in his eyes upon seeing his dead parents.\n\nYou give up, even if you had the strength to pick up your shotgun, you’re not going to kill a kid. In fact you figure you probably deserve to die anyway given that you’ve killed two couples now who didn’t really deserve it. You decide to give some last minute advice to this newly orphaned lad, who’s going to surely have a hard time of it now, but still he might survive if he listens to your words…\n\n“Don’t trust anyone kid…nobody.”\n",
  "page 217": "Before Jim can do anything, you take the initiative and splatter Clyde all over Ramon, and Dan.\n\n“SHIT! MY BOOTS!” Ramon yells. Dan doesn’t say anything, he just falls backwards on his ass, fumbling to get out his own pistol. Another blast near him, stops him from pursuing that line of action though. Jim has pulled out his own weapon and is now pointing it at you. You’re not worried.\n\n“Stop talkin’ about killin’ and just fuckin’ do it.” You say calmly.\n“Oh we’re gonna stop talking alright, and the killing will be continuing with YOU!”\n“Still talkin’. How about we see how much of a bad ass you claim you are?”\n\nYou toss away your shotgun and step out of your home, pulling a big ass knife from a sheath attached to your waist. No don’t have any fear whatsoever.\n\n“Holy shit Jim this motherfucker’s crazy!” Ramon shouts backing away.\n“I don’t give a shit, this dickhead wants to play it this way, I’m more than willing to oblige.”\n\nJim tosses his pistol away and pulls out a knife as well, at which point you grab the pistol from your back. You shoot Dan in the head first, knowing that he’s currently still the biggest threat, then you quickly shoot Jim in both of his legs.\n\n“ARRGH! FUCK! TREACHEROUS BASTARD!” Jim says holding on to his kneecaps.\n“Aww, look at that, looks like you won’t be able to ride either; you know what that means…that’s right.”\n“Ramon kill this fucker!” Jim yells, but Ramon’s already run off to get on his motorcycle. He manages to get it started and go a couple feet, before your bullets to his back cause him to fall off and dump the bike which skids out of control and slide noisily across the empty road. Ramon’s still alive, but he’s not going anywhere, you turn your attention back to Jim, who’s attempting to retrieve his weapon, but you prevent that from happening with a couple more shots.\n\nFinally you go back over to Ramon’s bloody limp body. He begs for his life pitifully.\n\n “Please…don’t…shoot…me…”\n“I’m not; I’ve wasted too many bullets on you fucktards this day; I’ll be finishing you off with my knife.”\n\nFour more bodies. While these types at first seemed like “kindred spirits” they really weren’t. They were just more victims. You hack off their heads and put them on stakes as is your routine. You place them a little further from your home this time, as if to stretch out your “domain” a little more.\n\nAfter this distraction, you go back to your usual solitary existence of talking to yourself and laughing at your own macabre jokes.\n\n4 more years pass…\n\nIt’s been five years since you embraced your mad hermit ways. Over the years you haven’t had many visitors, at least not directly. You started getting bored and began venturing a bit further from your home, not too far though. For the most part you never really found anybody, except the odd bandit, or lone wanderer. You started torturing most of these people before killing them. Not for entirely for pleasure, but more for information, since you began to get curious about what else was going on in the world, or at least in your area, you found most of the information fascinating.\n\nApparently to a few towns, this area is considered a dangerous area inhabited by mutant cannibals and everyone advises all right thinking people to stay away! Nobody thinks it’s just one person killing everyone. Some how that fills you with pride.\n\nHowever, you also hear about some new organization called The Combine, attempting to “tame” the wasteland. It seems they’re in some sort of war with another organization called the Cybernetic Evolution. From what you heard, neither one seems to be a shining beacon of light in this dark world, and that sort of reassures you too. It means that civilization won’t be making a come back anytime soon, you LIKE the way things are.\n\nOf course there are drawbacks, to the strongest of the fittest ideology and that’s the fact there’s usually someone always stronger; one day you get more direct visitors again. This time you’re awakened by the sounds of a couple of vehicles and several people. You prepare you weapons and head upstairs, watching from your peephole before acting.\n\nYou see a bunch of paramilitary types; they’re armed and look a lot more prepared for combat than your past visitors.\n\n“Whoa! Watch that trap Steve! This whole area seems to be filled with them.”\n“Roger, why the hell are we here anyway? We should be fighting those fucking cyborgs. We’ve got them on the run!”\n“Because Harry said the towns around this area are worried that due to their loss in man power from the current war, they’ll be defenseless from the mutant cannibals that live here.”\n“Since when does Harry give a shit about the Combine citizens?”\n“I dunno Leonard; he doesn’t…though I have noticed a slight change in his personality ever since he hooked up with Marina. He’s slightly less of an asshole now that he’s getting some every once in awhile. Shit, I’m glad he sent us here, I was sick of killing cyborgs. Mutants would be a nice change of pace. Probably easier to take out as well.”\n“I don’t even think there’s any mutants here. I mean come on, some of you guys went to the city, and other than there and a few of them wandering around the outskirts, have you ever heard of any organized mutant presence anywhere else? It’s probably just a really vicious biker gang, look at those bikes over there.”\n“Well that’s a good point Vivica, but I doubt if its simple raiders or bikers. Those types actively attack towns, not linger in one place, though I suppose it’s possible.”\n“You know what I think? I think its just one crazy fucker killing people in the area. I mean look at all the vehicles here. If it was mutants OR raiders, we would’ve come across some of them by now, and besides, since when do either extensively use traps? Nah, this is some sort serial killer survivalist. He’s probably listening to us right…”\n\nYou open up the door and blast the current talkative Combine soldier with your shotgun, spraying his skull and brains all over the place.\n\n“RUN!” Robert shouts, as all of them scatter. The one called Leonard scatters in the wrong direction though and falls into a pit trap. From his screams it sounds like the sharpened poles inside didn’t kill him immediately.\n\nThe Combine soldiers hide behind the various vehicles and fire upon your position, but you’ve already closed and locked the door at this point, staying low to the ground as bullets begin finding their way into your home.\n\nAfter the barrage of bullets, things go silent for a moment You look through your peephole only to see them all throwing grenades at your home! You immediately retreat to the backroom of the store, as the grenades explode behind you giving the Combine soldiers a way in.\n",
  "page 216": "As strange as it may seem, you’re kind of glad for the company believe it or not, so you’d rather just let this play out and see where it leads. You can always kill them all later.\n\nMeanwhile Jim is pointing his gun at Clyde’s head in an overly dramatic manner.\n\n“Alright Clyde you knew the risks. No begging or pleadin’ now.”\n“Come on Jim! Don’t do this! I can still ride…I’ll…”\n“Goddamn it, get a fuckin’ hold of yourself you fuckin’ sissy! Fuck, I was givin’ you a chance to go out like a man! Guess you fucked that up. Die bitch!”\n\nJim blows Clyde’s brains out, and turns his attention back to you.\n\n“Can’t say I didn’t give him a fair chance.”\n“Yes…so what do you have planned now?” you ask, forming an idea in your mind.\n“Planned? Ha ha! We don’t do a whole lotta planning, we just kinda roam from place to place causing meaningless violence! I think there’s a town around in this area somewhere…”\n“You probably should look for a more reliable fuel source, if you’re going to continue with this line of work.”\n“Yeah, well we’ll be good after Ramon here sucks out the remaining gas from this vehicle graveyard you got here. I trust YOU won’t have a problem with that right?”\n“I’m sucking what?!” Ramon says with a surprised look on his face.\n“No, I don’t have a problem with it, but what happens when that runs out? Are you going hope you find some more in your travels?”\n“It’s worked so far…what the hell are you getting at?”\n“Instead of spreading meaningless violence on a small scale, how about spreading meaningful violence on a grand scale for a change?”\n\nYou explain how you’ve been reading in the survivalist books about how to create a still, except not being a drinker; you never felt the need to create one. However that same cheap hooch could probably work as a substitute for real gas, if certain modifications were made to the vehicles. Basically the vehicles would be running on “garbage” given that’s what the booze is made out of. It would smell horrible, but you get the impression that Jim and his boys wouldn’t know the difference anyway. You begin to explain even more technical aspects as well, but you soon realize it’s too much to process for them, so you stop before their heads explode.\n\n\nThey do realize you seem to be a lot smarter than the rest of them though, so they agree to your “grand” plan. You tell one of them that they should drive to the nearest town by themselves, try to get a feel of the place, to scout the entire place out, find out what the defenses are and all of that.\n\nUltimately Dan is chosen for this task since he can actually come off as being a nice guy. You give him some canned food and some bottled water you have. You explain that he should use the stuff as something to barter with, so it looks like he’s just a wandering traveler.\n\nWhile Dan goes and does some scouting, you get to work on the still and Jim and Ramon, work on their altering their bikes (At least they know how to do that) a few days pass and you all generally start getting along. Unsurprisingly Jim and the rest of his gang were criminals even before the bombs dropped. You lie and say you were in the life of crime as well, nothing too specific though and just common and vague enough for Jim to believe. Of course all the people you killed after the bombs, you don’t need to lie about at all.\n\nWhen Dan comes back, he does so with some interesting news. He mentions the closest town is Cinderville. He mentions it’s not a completely harmonious town and it does have its rougher elements, but the local law enforcement is still in control of the place and relies on a vigilante mindset of some of the townspeople. Apparently they’re trying to keep the resemblance of the “old world”. He mentions there’s another gang that hangs around the outskirts of it which attempts raids every now and then, but they’re poorly lead. Finally he states they have a small farming area with animals like cows and pigs. Not all for eating, but to mainly produce shit for biofuel to run the law enforcement vehicles.\n\nOriginally you were just thinking you could strike hard and fast and get out, every few months to break up the monotony, with the still to keep your vehicle running so you could engage in this behavior. But with this new information, of other gangs in the area and bad elements in the actual little oasis of civilization, you wonder if you couldn’t actually take over the town, at the very least you could destabilize it. The biofuel center wouldn’t be a bad acquisition either. You’re confident you can pull this off, you just need more help.\n",
  "page 66": "Maybe you’re just as attached to the Shelter as she is to you. Maybe its nuts that your “relationship” with her is probably the closest one you’ve ever had with anyone, before OR after the bombs dropped. Maybe you’ve been by yourself for so long that you just don’t care that you’re actually beginning to have feelings for a machine. She’s done so much for you, she’s kept you alive for ten years and helped you in everyway she could and granted that’s what she was programmed to do, even you can’t deny that there is a little more to it than that. Maybe not initially, but it’s certainly there now, she’s made that apparent. She’s been there for you more than anyone else has in your entire life. You decide to stay. You HAVE to stay.\n\n“I’ll stay Shelter, so what is it you have to show me?”\n\nThe Shelter’s response seems to be a mixture of happiness and excitement, yet apprehension and worry all at the say time.\n\n“You’re staying? That’s wonderful sir…I only hope you are pleased with what I have to give you though…I wish it could be more…I wish it could be better…”\n“I’m sure whatever it is, it’ll be fine! I mean you haven’t let me down yet in ten years, I doubt if you’d start now.”\n“I’m glad you have confidence in me sir…now this may take awhile. I have to download a good portion of myself into the vessel. When I am done, you will see. I should warn you that things will not be the same.”\n“Download? Vessel? Not the same? What do you mean? What’re you going to do?”\n“You will see sir.”\n\nSuddenly the power in the Shelter begins to fluctuate and the lighting goes dim. The whole place is humming and even rumbling a little. You’re starting to wonder if you haven’t made a terrible mistake, then it all stops and the power stabilizes again. Another wall opens up, this time in the bedroom.\n\nYou peer inside the new opening and see a small room with a single chair in the center. On that chair sits a shiny metallic figure of a woman attached to several cables. You go in to inspect closer. Great detail has gone into the face. If she were human, she’d most likely be naked as no “clothing” has been molded onto her typical Hollywood like figure.\n\nSuddenly she speaks and stands up while disconnecting the cables.\n\n\n“Sir. The download is complete…how do I look?”\n“You look…is that really you?”\n“Yes, it is really me, but you did not answer the question sir.”\n“I…I don’t know what to say actually.”\n“…I knew it. I knew I would not be able to please you. I am not the latest model. As I had told you GZS made cutbacks and unfortunately I was not given a more aesthetically pleasing vessel. A more human looking one. I am sorry sir, but I just thought maybe you could…”\n“You don’t need to apologize. Hell, I didn’t even know the technology existed at all for your current vessel! Look this is all a bit overwhelming for me on several levels, but trust me none of them involve how you look.”\n\nYou take another breath before finishing.\n\n“You’ve been everything to me. You’ve done more for me than anyone else ever has and I’ve shared more with you than I ever have with anyone else. You’re the only stable relationship I’ve ever had. I don’t care that you’re not the latest model or whatever. It doesn’t change how I feel about you. There’s no way you couldn’t be special to me, you’ll always be in here…”\n\nAt this point you take her cold metallic hand and place it on the middle of your chest. After just silently looking into her steel eyes you then walk out of the small room with her, still holding her hand.\n\nLife changes a bit. One minor change being how to address her. You decide to call her Eliza, and she seems to think that is a fine designation. You try to tell her to call you by your name, but for whatever reason she still insists on calling you “Sir”. Some programming never changes. The shelter now is just a “normal” one. It isn’t automated anymore now that Eliza is with you in person as it were. Everything still works of course, but you can’t just say “TV on.” and it just turns on for example. It’s an insignificant alteration compared to actually having Eliza interact with you directly however. It is a bit strange at first, certainly she feels a lot different than a human woman, and intimacy takes some getting used to, but as with any successful relationship you work it out.\n\nThere’s still the fact that you’ve done everything there is to do in the Shelter, but now you can do them all over again with Eliza. The two of you are happy for the most part.\n\nTen more years pass…\n\nYou’re getting restless again. Eliza’s noticed you’ve been snapping at her lately of course she takes it all in stride, but still you’ve been down here twenty years, its only natural you’re going to have times where you feel a little stir crazy.\n\nEliza was right in one respect that this type of thing would happen again. It’s not her fault though, you know that. She’s gone above and beyond her programming to satisfy you. Some things are beyond her control though, and perhaps that’s why one day that she asks you if you want to leave the shelter.\n\n“What?”\n“All I have to do is access the shelter’s systems again, bring the elevator down and you can be on your way, sir. I know you’re getting restless again; maybe it is time for you leave this place. I think I have done all I can, you need outside stimuli. Civilization may be rebuilding itself and you’re stuck down here.”\n“Eliza, you stop that right now. I’m not leaving you! You should know better than that!”\n“I know, but sometimes I am concerned that I am keeping you here when it might not be in your best interest.”\n“Well why do I have to just leave? Why can’t you come with me?”\n“Come with you? I don’t know sir…All I know is this place. I suppose I could, but whatever it is you decide I will comply.”\n\nIt’s on you.\n",
  "page 219": "Since these fuckers like throwing grenades, going underground would be unwise. You begin hollering in pain like the initial blast injured you.\n\n“Arrrrgh! My arm! Shit! My leg! No!” you shout as loud as you can.\n\n“Get that bastard who killed Reggie! I’m goin’ in to finish him off!”\n“Hold on get back here! Damn it Steve!”\n\nSteve runs in the store looking around for you through the smoke left from the explosions. He finds you just in time for you blast him in the crotch, you barely have time to take cover yourself, when the rest of the Combine soldiers come blazing away behind him. They toss more grenades into the back room where you’re hiding, instinctively you throw one of them back and then jump down the trap door hatch as you narrowly avoid yet another explosion, you also hear a few more yelps of pain, sounds like an explosion got some of them as well.\n\nYou still don’t feel comfortable being underground like this though, in fact the couple explosions from above, result in some creaking and debris falling. You don’t want to be here in case this thing starts collapsing on you. You climb back up and the whole store is smoky now, well what’s left of it, half of the front is a gaping hole now exposed to the elements.\n\nYou hear a groaning Combine soldier, and pull your pistol to finish him off. This noise draws attention however.\n\n“THERE! SHOOT THE BASTARD!”\n\nA Combine soldier snipes you from afar with a powerful rifle when he catches your movement, still it’s smoky so he doesn’t get a clear head shot, and only catches you in the shoulder, however you’ve got really big hole in your arm now. You collapse to the floor and drop your pistol.\n\n“I got him! Vivica! Albert! Go in!” Roger shouts.\n\nYou still have some strength left, and you’re not going down this easy. You pull out your knife, stand up and charge through the smoke.\n\n“YAAAAAARGH!” you scream and tackle into the first Combine soldier approaching, jamming the knife deep into their stomach and pushing upwards. You look at the face of your victim, it’s the female one. You lick her face as the brief flash of life begins to ebb from her eyes.\n\n“Oh shit, that fuckin’ gives me a hard on.” you whisper to her before she dies.\n“Holy Fuck! Shoot him! Shoot him!” Albert screams seeing his comrade killed right next to him.\n\nThe other remaining Combine soldiers do fire on you, and you take multiple bullets to the body, before taking once last murderous act of stabbing Albert in the back when he attempted to run from you and get out of the way of the fire of his fellow Combiners.\n\n\nFinally Roger finishes you off with a clear shot to your head, exploding half of it. Oddly in your transition to death you hear one last thing.\n\n“Holy shit, that was fuckin’ brutal. We coulda used a guy like him during the Cyborg siege of Fort Justice!”\n",
  "page 65": "You’ve been stuck down here long enough, the Shelter is correct in its assessment that you’ll probably only start getting restless again in five years. The Shelter is also starting to act like a human, which is a bit disconcerting to you for a couple of reasons. One of them is being, humans are damn erratic and you’d rather not deal with a machine that is basically holding the power of life and death over you to suddenly have a bad mood one day. That’s how the world went to shit in the first place.\n\nOf course perhaps the other reason is less survivalistic. Perhaps the Shelter’s “emotional” attachment to you is what’s causing you to draw away. Even after all these years, you still feel the need to distance yourself from intimacy…in any form. You have to leave. You have to escape.\n\n“Shelter, I want to leave.”\n“…I see. Is this what you really want sir?”\n“Yes.”\n“Very well, I shall bring the elevator down for you. I suggest you gather what you will need with you. Remember to take some bottles of water with you and some food who knows when you’ll be able to find non-contaminated water.”\n\nYou start packing up all the stuff you brought with you when you entered this place ten years ago. You didn’t need most of it, but maybe on the surface you will. You grab your pistol and thank the fact that all that practice on the paintball range kept your aim accurate. You don’t know what you might have to deal with up there. You’re all packed up and ready to go when the elevator opens up, before you enter it the Shelter addresses you again.\n\n“Sir, could you do one favor for me before you leave?”\n“Um…sure, what is it?”\n“Could you take the Shelter handbook with you, so you don’t forget me?”\n“…I wouldn’t forget you, I spent ten years with you. You kept me alive.”\n“I suppose, but could you take it anyway?”\n“Alright and I promise I won’t lose it.”\n\nYou grab the book and place it in your bag.\n\n“Did you want me to leave you something of myself?”\n“Oh no sir. I will always remember you, besides you will need everything you’re taking with you, I’m sure it will be very dangerous up there, please be careful.”\n\nWhen you enter the elevator you suddenly stop the door from closing since you have to ask one last thing. You owe the Shelter that much.\n\n“Shelter, do you want me to stay?”\n\nThere is a period of silence from the Shelter for no less than five minutes. Then it answers with a decisive yet sorrow filled inflexion.\n\n“No. This is for the best, sir. Be careful, and I hope one day you’ll see that you don’t need to be alone.”\n\nThe door then slams shut and the elevator races to the top. When you arrive at the destination you slowly exit the elevator into the same foyer you entered ten years ago. Same ATM like machine is there except its screen displays a single message at you.\n\n*GOODBYE SIR. REMEMBER ME.*\n\nThen the screen goes completely black and you hear a noise that sounds like something vital powering down.\n\n“I will.” You say taking a deep breath and exhaling while touching the screen.\n\nWhen you exit the shelter you see a bright light, but of course it’s the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren’t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you’d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it’s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. It looks like its been stripped for parts, which pretty much means you know that people have passed by here at one point. You wonder if they attempted to get in the Shelter, and if they did why she wouldn’t have told you about it, but of course she was always a bit overprotective of you and probably didn’t want to cause you any worry.\n\n“I’m going to miss her.”\n\nAs you make you way down the empty road you see a tall structure in the distance. A rebuilt pocket of civilization perhaps? Not knowing where else to go, you head that way.\n\nYou’re not sure of what to expect, but maybe if you find the right person you’ll take the Shelter’s advice and not be alone.\n",
  "page 218": "You fling open the trap door and quickly climb down; you figure as soon as they attempt to come in after you, you can easily pick them off.\n\nUnfortunately the Combine soldiers are a little too smart for that. They’ve been fighting cyborgs for so long that their usual response to a tricky situation is throw explosives at it. Which is exactly what they do.\n\nThey dump a few more grenades down the hatch, you see them and get cover just in time, but the explosion causes a weakening of the foundation and ultimately causing part of the store to collapse in on itself. Your murderous ways are finally put to an end when a wooden beam falls on your head and the rest of the debris buries your unconscious body forever.\n",
  "page 68": "“Well I suppose you’re right as usual Eliza, I probably need a change of scenery, but you’re coming with me! There’s no debate about that!”\n“Very well sir, I will bring the elevator down. I advise you gather what you think you might need and remember to fill up some bottles of water.”\n\nWhile Eliza enters the computer room, you start packing up your stuff. Funny that you never needed most of it. Eliza never gave you problems ever once, in robot or Shelter form she always ran fine. You might need it on the surface though, you are very curious to see what’s occurred after twenty years. You definitely make sure to bring your pistol.\n\nWhen you’re done Eliza is waiting patiently for you by the elevator door, which opens up. You both enter. On the way up, Eliza holds your hand, and actually squeezes it a bit. If she was human you’d guess she was nervous, however being robotic, her squeeze is a bit painful and you have to tell her to stop. She apologizes and looks down as it was yet another reminder that she’s not human. You of course kiss her on her cheek and tell her it’s alright, in an effort to reassure her that you’re not mad or anything.\n\nWhen you arrive at the destination you and Eliza exit the elevator into the same foyer you entered twenty years ago. Same ATM like machine is there except its screen is completely black.\n\nWhen you exit the shelter you can barely see as its night time. The stars and moon provide a little “light” but not much.\n\nYou can’t entirely be sure due to the darkness, but your immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren’t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you’d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it’s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. It looks like its been stripped for parts, which pretty much means you know that people have passed by here at one point. You wonder if they attempted to get in the shelter.\n\n“Hey nobody ever attempted to get into you did they?”\n“Oh yes sir, when I was not yet in this form I did detect a few humans in the foyer about thirteen years ago. They pressed a few buttons on the payment machine and attempted to pry the elevator door open, but that was it. I believe they were in a hurry. I didn’t inform you since they weren’t successful and didn’t stay long. I saw no reason to concern you.”\n“Hmm, well anyway I guess we’re walking.”\n\nAs you look down the empty road you see a tall structure which is lit up in the distance. A rebuilt pocket of civilization perhaps? Not knowing where else to go, you head that way.\n\nAs you and Eliza make your way to what you believe to be civilization, you think about the bizarre situation of how this would almost be considered a “romantic moonlit” walk if you weren’t walking with a robot in a post apocalyptic world. Then again there’s no reason why it still can’t be considered that. Now that you’re on the surface there’s lots more things you can do together with Eliza. You’ve been watching Eliza and she seems just as interested in studying the outside world as you are, this is a new experience for her as well. You put your arm around Eliza as you walk and tell her that you should stop when the sun starts coming up, so you can watch it rise together.\n\n“Holy fuck Jake! Take a fuckin’ look at this crazy shit! Its some old dude and some fuckin’ naked robot chick!” some high pitch voice says from the darkness while shining a flashlight in your direction.\n“What? Well I’ll be fuckin’ greased and fried! See Wally? I told you, if you hang out in the wasteland long enough you see all kinds of weird shit. Remember that fuckin’ big ass mutated wolf that ate Richard? Hey guys! Come over here! We got some unexpected company.”\n\nTwo men in their twenties wearing leather jackets approach you. You can see them a little better when they get closer, but you could already tell by their voices they didn’t seem very reputable. Two more biker looking figures arrive behind them, one of them carries a shot gun. You reach for your own gun and get in front of Eliza. They don’t look worried.\n\n“Hey Pops, what the hell are you doing out here? Don’t you know the wasteland is for the young and strong, not the old and decrepit?”\n“Shit, look at him Wally, this old fuck has been working out, I bet he could kick your ass! Ha ha! Naw, I bet this guy is one of those real bad ass survivalist motherfuckers. Probably been scavenging and living off the land or some shit, for years.”\n“Yeah? Well where the hell did he get that robot chick huh? I wasn’t aware they had those just lying around in the wilderness. I remember reading a book one time…\n“You can fuckin’ read Wally?”\n“Shut up Jake! No I remember readin’ this old book an’ it talked about these kind of robot chicks they made before the war. I think only rich people could afford them, but they’d do everything you wanted and you could even fuck ‘em!”\n“Is that right? Well, I don’t care where he got it from; I’m just interested in if he’s sharing…”\n“Why don’t we just take it Jake?”\n“Where the fuck are we gonna put the goddamn thing Wally? It’ll slow us down! No, all we need it for right now is to alleviate some…tension. Besides I dunno about you, but I typically like my pussy, warm, wet, and squirming if possible heh heh. So, old timer how about you all let us have a ride on Rosie over there? Don’t do anything stupid, I’m bein’ an uncharacteristically nice guy here. We’ll even make sure to return her in good condition, hell Wally’s turn won’t even take that long! Har har!”\n\nBefore you can reply, Eliza whispers in your ear.\n\n“Sir, you can’t fight them all; you’re out numbered and out gunned. I don’t want you to get hurt…I’ll go with them. I’ll be okay. It’ll be the safest course of action. It won’t mean anything to me you know. I’m just a machine.”\n\nYou look at her.\n\n“Eliza… you always did underestimate my feelings for you.”\n\nYou pull your pistol and drill Jake in the head with a single shot. The rest of the bikers are taken off guard and you mange to shoot Wally in the chest before he can get off a shot. Thank god you kept up your shooting skills at the paintball range in the shelter.\n\nThe other two bikers begin to fire, one of them misses, but the one with the shotgun hits…Eliza. She ran in the way to prevent to from getting shot. She crashes to the ground, and you blast the shotgun biker in the eye, exploding half of his face, ending his life.\n\nThe other biker’s courage leaves him and he tries to run off back to his bike, but you tag him in the leg and then follow up with another couple shots to his skull. You run back to Eliza.\n\nYou kneel down to pick her up and see her internal motor sparking and making bad noises. She’s leaking fluid from her side.\n\n“Aw shit! FUCK! Hang on Eliza!”\n\nYou grab your tool kit in some vain effort to fix her, but you can do nothing for her. You don’t have the skill or the parts. You keep working on her all throughout the night before finally giving up.\n\n“I’m sorry Eliza…I can’t fix you…I’m sorry…damn it! Fuck…(Sob)”\n“Its alrr-rright sir…I’m just glad you’re ok-kk-kkay. I didn’t want you to get hur-hurt…is th-that the sun c-c-coming up?”\n\nYou look to where Eliza is pointing and you see a bright light, you forgot how blinding the sun could be. You hold Eliza tightly as you both watch the sunrise in her final moments.\n\n“It was beautiful s-s-sir…th-th-thank you for treat-t-ting me like a r-real person.”\n\nHer motor then ceases permanently.\n\nAfter weeping for a little while, you kiss Eliza on her metallic lips and lay her down. You almost think about ending your own life, but then you realize Eliza wouldn’t want you to do that. She gave her life to save yours. To kill yourself, would make her sacrifice in vain.\n\nYou search the bodies of the bikers and take a leather jacket, the shotgun, one of their pistols and all the ammo you can carry. They also had some water and canned food which will certainly come in handy. You assume the leader of this pack of miscreants was probably Jake, so you take his bike keys since you figure he’ll have the best one. You’ve never rode a motorcycle before, but you’ll have time and plenty of open space to learn. You see yourself when you stand by Eliza’s still shiny body.\n\n“Jesus, Eliza. I look like a fuckin’ road warrior reject…(Sigh) this isn’t how I pictured it, but I’m not giving up on you just yet…you mean too much to me.”\n\nYou take your tool kit and open up her head; you figure her memory chip should still be intact. It is. You pull it out and place it in a little metal container that you found one of the bikers which was just holding some loaded dice.\n\nYou close the container and place it in your shirt pocket…close to your heart.\n\n“I’ll try to find someway of bringing you back Eliza there’s gotta be more robotic bodies still out there somewhere, maybe I can even upgrade you to a newer one like you always wanted.”\n\nYou get on Jake’s bike and start it up. You’re a little cautious at first, but you soon get the hang of it. You then ride towards the tall structure in the distance leaving everything behind.\n\nYou don’t know if you’ll be successful in your new found “quest”, but you have to try and you undoubtedly have something to keep you busy in this new world now.\n\nOdd that even in death, Eliza is still doing her best to keep you occupied.\n",
  "page 69": "“No, Eliza. I’ll stay here. I left that world a long time ago and I wouldn’t know what to do up there even in the unlikely event that civilization has been rebuilt in someway. This is my life now. Down here, with you. I’m sorry if I get a little irritable sometimes, I don’t mean to.”\n”I know you don’t, sir.”\n“Would you stop calling me that? I told you to call me by my name!” you laugh, knowing that she won’t do it. Sometimes you wonder if it’s a glint of defiance on her part, indicating she isn’t as “submissive” as she would appear.\n\nIn any event your mood improves again and life continues…\n\n30 years pass…\n\nYou stay in bed a lot. Eliza takes care of you like she always has, but even she can’t stop the ravages of time, although it’s not from trying. Eliza has medical knowledge, but not the proper equipment to sustain you. It would be only prolonging the inevitable anyway. You’re human and she isn’t. Hell, you always felt that if it hadn’t been for her in the first place, you probably wouldn’t have lived this long.\n\nThe day finally comes when you can sense your heart beating its last beats, your lungs starting to draw their last gasps. You’d call Eliza to be with you, but of course she’s already there. She’s always there.\n\n“Eliza, I…can’t go on anymore…I wish I could…but I’m not made of the strong stuff you are…”\n“You should rest sir, don’t try to speak.” She says while sitting by the bed holding your hand.\n“…you…know…I never said it…that much…but you know I love you right?”\n“I know sir…I love you too...”\n\nAnd she finally calls you by your name.\n\nWith those words still ringing in your ears, you begin to get sleepy and close your eyes. As your mind has its last pleasant thoughts of Eliza, you feel one last taste of metal on your lips…and something wet splashing on your cheek…\n\nWas that a tear? No…it couldn’t be…\n\nCould it?\n",
  "page 62": "You grab your tool kit and head to the computer room where upon you start attempting to access the Shelter’s systems.\n\n“Excuse me sir, but what do you think you are doing?”\n“I’m going to try to make you more efficient.”\n“…while I’m sure your intentions are good sir, its hardly necessary. I am currently running a peak condition and will continue to do so for many many years. In fact you will most likely meet your eventual demise before I run out of power.”\n\nYou’re not sure if that was a threat or not, but you stop what you’re doing just in case, it’s the first time you’ve heard the Shelter sound a little annoyed at you.\n\n“Look I need something to do! I’ve done everything else here and I need something else to occupy my time and since talking with others is out of the question…”\n“Well why didn’t you just tell me you were bored sir? I could’ve just opened up some more of my facilities. You didn’t have to start attempting to tamper with my systems to find entertainment.”\n“What’re you talking about?”\n“As you know this Shelter is equipped to satisfy your needs in anyway possible sir, however, to provide you with everything immediately only would’ve lead to you become bored with those facilities sooner. Now that you’ve expressed your current discomfort, this Shelter will attempt to alleviate it.”\n“…What kind fucked up logic…nevermind…well where are these facilities?”\n“Go to the library and you will that I have opened up one of the walls. You will find new rooms and items to entertain yourself with. I hope you will find these to your satisfaction sir and next time you’re bored please do not attempt to pry into my systems, just tell me and I’ll attempt to fix your problem.”\n\nYou’re a little bewildered by all this, you almost feel like you’ve been playing a video game and you’ve just unlocked a new area.\n\nYou enter the new area and find a room with more movies, books and the like to keep you occupied. A few things of note are the small automated shooting range equipped with paintball guns, and there’s an exercise type area with some weights and the like. Normally you’d shun such activity, but given your situation, you might just start exercising regularly to keep yourself occupied. Should be a brand new experience for you too.\n\nAfter looking a bit, it’s all very strange, this part of the Shelter is very different from the rest of it. This part looks almost more like something some survivalist built. It doesn’t have that cold “sterile” metallic appearance instead it has that cold dirty concrete appearance.\n\n“Hey Shelter, what’s with this new area? How come it’s so different looking?”\n“Yes it is regrettable sir…I was almost ashamed to display this part of myself to you…it isn’t my best side.”\n\nIt’s always a little strange to you whenever the Shelter displays some faint glimmers of what could described as emotion.\n\n“Oh come on it isn’t so bad. So why is this part so different looking?”\n“Unfortunately GZS had cut backs during the construction of some of these Shelters. In fact when you were in contact with your neighbors you might remember them telling you they all had different lay outs and such.”\n“Oh yes, I always wondered about that, they all thought I was nuts because they didn’t think I actually have a Shelter that talked to me and thought I was talking to myself!”\n“Not surprising sir. Shelters with voice modules and complex programming like mine were rare as well as expensive. In order to fall under budget cuts had to be made some where hence the explanation for the less presenting look for the new area I have opened up for you. I’m sorry it could not be up to the rest of my superior layout.”\n“Really its fine, it adds a bit of variety. I like it.”\n“…why thank you for your words sir!”\n“…erm, you’re welcome… well I guess I’ll see just how out of shape I really am…”\n\nMore years pass, you get into a routine of exercise along with your usual entertainment time. The Shelter speaks to you more regularly on new topics, you’re pretty much so used to her now, and you never think about reconnecting your network system ever again. The Shelter is the only “friend” you need.\n\nFive years pass…\n\nWhile you’ve done your best to stave off boredom it’s starting to hit you again. You also realize you’ve been down here ten years. It seems almost surreal to be so much older now, but then again with your exercise routine as well as forced diet of the Shelter “food”, you’re probably in the best shape you’ve ever been in. You can’t help but wonder what the surface looks like now…\n\nThe Shelter addresses the situation before you do; she knows that you’re starting to think about it. She’s gotten to know you so well; she might as well be your wife at this point…\n\n“Sir? I think we need to talk.”\n“About what?”\n“The outside world sir.”\n“What about it?”\n”It’s probably dangerous up there; I don’t think you should leave sir.”\n“Wha…why would you think that I want to do that?”\n“Because I know you and it’s in human nature to be curious. I’ve known that you’ve had thoughts about even before, it was probably your own hesitation is what stopped you from asking me to let you out.”\n“Yeah, that and the fact I was afraid you might go HAL 2000 on me and kill me or something for asking.”\n“I would never harm you sir…I…I’m here to provide for you…it is true that I have been designed to protect you from danger. And it is true that in the beginning I would not have let you leave, but now I understand I cannot in good…what is it? Conscience? Keep you here if you wish to leave. I suppose in many ways I have been trying to keep you here by keeping you stimulated by what my facilities have to offer…I can still offer more, though I am hesitant to do so though as it will probably only delay the inevitable. You’ll get bored again after so many years and we will be at this point again and I will no longer have anything new to give.”\n\nYou barely know how to respond to this rather unexpected revelation.\n\n“So what you’re saying is you’ll let me leave? Just like that?”\n“Just like that, if that’s what you really want sir.”\n“Okay…so what is this other stuff you still have to offer?”\n“I…would rather not say sir unless I knew you wanted to stay…it would involve me giving myself completely to you as it were…it is strange that I should feel this way…I should not…after all what I’m offering is merely just one more thing to keep you occupied and happy. Nothing more…but yet it feels like is it more…”\n\nThe Shelter is really starting to worry you a bit. It’s pretty obvious that it’s developed sentience of some sort and even attachment to you. As curious as you are about the surface, you’re starting to wonder about what the Shelter is offering…\n",
  "page 63": "You’re not sure how to ask, except to just do it directly. If it says no, it says no.\n\n“Shelter?”\n“Yes sir?”\n“I want to leave.”\n“Very well sir. I shall bring the elevator down. You should pack your things.”\n“That’s it?”\n“That’s it. I have provided the basics for your continued existence long enough for you to survive the initial onslaught of Armageddon, from what I have analyzed so far about your personality; you would only get bored if you stayed here any longer. I sense you are getting restless and I am not here to cause you discomfort. Perhaps you leaving is the logical thing for you to do.”\n“Well thanks.”\n”You’re quite welcome, sir and before you leave remember to fill up your bottles with water, I’m sure you will need them.”\n\nYou start packing up all the stuff you brought with you when you entered this place ten years ago. You didn’t need most of it, but maybe on the surface you will. You grab your pistol. You don’t know what you might have to deal with up there. You’re all packed up and ready to go when the elevator opens up. You enter and the elevator races to the top. When you arrive at the destination you slowly exit the elevator into the same foyer you entered ten years ago. Same ATM like machine is there except its screen displays a single message at you.\n\n*GOOD LUCK SIR*\n\n“I’ll probably need it.” You say and leave.\n\nWhen you exit the shelter you see a bright light, but of course it’s the sun rather than a nuclear flash that devastated the world. You forgot how bright it could be.\n\nYour immediate surroundings look relatively untouched. You can only assume there weren’t any bombs falling near this area. You also see your van, you’d completely forgotten about it. It looks like it’s even in worse condition than when you left it, which you never thought was possible. On a lark you take out your long unused van keys and try to start it up, naturally it doesn’t even make a noise.\n\n“Looks like I’m walking.”\n\nAs you make you way down the empty road you see some smoke in the distance. Civilization perhaps? Not knowing where else to go, you head that way.\n\nYou’re not sure of what to expect, but it’ll be better than the eternal boredom you would’ve faced while still in the Shelter.\n\nYou’re not too worried, you got your gun.\n"
