Huge thanks to BerkaZerka for play-testing! ^_^\nYou are trapped in an medieval tower dungeon, which is never a good way to start your day. Luckily there seems to be a secret passage for you to escape through. All you have to do is solve a few riddles and you\u0027re free as a bird. Easy right? Just so long as you don\u0027t get a riddle wrong, then you die a horrible death... Good luck!\n(It is definitely possible to win this game, once you figure out how.)"]
