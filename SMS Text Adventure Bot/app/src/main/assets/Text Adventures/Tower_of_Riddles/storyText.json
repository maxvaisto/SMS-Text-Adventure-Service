{"page 123":"The jester ghost gives a disappointed and rather childish looking pout at your answer. “Awhh, you got it wrong.” He whines sulkily, but then quickly cheers up as he jumps to his feet and walks over to you with a big smile on his face. “Tell you what, since I like you I’ll give you a second riddle, how’s that?”\n\n\nAfraid that he’ll do another cartwheel through you, you start backing away from the ghost towards the wall, which only seems to make him smile more. You are relieved that the next riddle is spoken in words rather than numbers. “What has no brains, a face like an arse, screams like a little girl and can’t fly?” You’re actually dumb enough to think about this for a moment. It’s not until your back touches the window and the jester comes face to face with you with that cruel smirk across his face that you realize the answer.\n\n\n“It’s me isn’t it?” You ask, feeling like a right muppet.\n\n\n“I don’t know, let’s see!” And with that the ghost of the jester lifts his leg which rather than passing through you, delivers a sharp kick to your stomach causing you to crash through the window and fall to your death. Sure enough, you scream like a little girl.\n","page 244":"You cannot see but beneath the wizard’s helmet, his lips curve into a cruel, delighted smile. “With pleasure!” He declares, rubbing his hands together. “It’s been awhile though, let me see if I can remember how to do this.” Chanting some kind of demonic spell, the lord of the tower spins one hand around and sure enough a ball of fire starts to form in the palm of his hand. It grows and grows until the chant is finally done and the wizard hurls the fire ball your way. You of course are consumed by the flames and die screaming in agony.\n","page 365":"“Really?” Asks the wizard. “That seems like a strange way to want to die. Hanging’s usually a punishment reserved for murderers and bandits, but if that’s what you really want I suppose I could whip something up.” The lord of the tower then performs some sort of conjuring spell and suddenly you find yourself with a noose around your neck. The rope is swung over a chandelier that hangs from the ceiling with the other end falling down into the wizard’s hands. “Goodbye little peasant.” And with that, the wizard tugs on the rope and you are lifted into the air by your neck. You struggle and squirm and pull at the rope around your neck, but eventually you are choked to death.\n","page 122":"The ghostly jester gives you a round of applause at your answer. “Ahh, so you speak in numbers! Well done! Good work! Well I suppose this means I have to let you go now. Oh well, off you go then. 7/15/15/4 12/21/3/11 and all that!” And with that the jester jumps up to pull on one of two cords that is hanging near the lord’s chair. It looks like one of those cords that nobles use to ring for servants, but rather than ringing a bell, the cord opens a trap door that sends you falling down to the room below and landing with a nasty bump on your arse. Well at least you didn’t have to go down more stairs.\n\n\nThe room is dark save for the light coming from the trapdoor. All you can see in the room is a table on which sit three things, a large bowl of water, a small pot and a piece of paper with a list of names and numbers written on it. The list looks like this;\n\n\nJohn 2.7\n\n\nMark 9.41\n\n\nMatthew 27.24\n\n\nJoshua 3.15\n\n\nLuke 8.24\n\n\nWell, you’re obviously supposed to do something with the water and the cup. What do you want to do first?\n","page 243":"Just as you are about to reach the exit, the doors slam shut and you can hear cruel, manic laughter coming from behind you. Well, you should have seen this coming, you really, really should. Reluctantly turning around, you find yourself face to face with the most menacing looking individual you’ve ever come across. Clad from head to toe in armour, holding a giant sword in his hand and… Is that a skull on his breastplate? Yes, this man is defiantly “Evil Lord” material.\n\n\n \n\n“Congratulations!” The man cheers, applauding you with his mail clad hands. “None of the peasants I’ve had brought to my tower have ever made it this far before. I must thank you stranger, I was starting to grow very bored. Finally, a subject worthy of my riddles! I’m almost tempted to let you go… But no! I’m afraid your path ends here.”\n\n\n“Hello?” A soft voice gently whispers. “Hello, can you hear me?”\n\n\nAs the Evil lord speaks, you think you can hear a very faint sound of whispering. You try to make out what’s being said but the noise is cut off when the Evil Lord resumes his little rant. “You see peasant, there is no escape from this tower. Once you enter your life is mine to do with as I please! I have all the darkest magic at my disposal. I could make you my ghostly slave, or an undead guard for my fortress, or I could always just feed you to my vampires. Still, since you have come so far, I think you’ve earned yourself a reward, yes?”\n\n\n“Listen to me! The wizard has trapped this room in a loop of time!”\n\n\nYou think you can hear whispering again, but it’s so faint that trying to make out the words is like trying to find a baby polar bear in a snow storm. “Are you listening to me peasant? Here is the reward I offer you. You have impressed me so much, that I will allow you to choose the way you die!”\n\n\n“This is a trick! Don’t try fighting him, you’ll only end up back here again!”\n\n\nThere’s that whispering again. You think they said something about fighting him. “Oh, but it’s got to be something creative though. It’s been so long since I’ve got to show off my magic. Let me summon a fire ball or strike you down with lightning or something. Nothing boring like asking me to chop of your head with my sword of anything like that.\n\n\n“Don\u0027t worry, you can escape, but there’s a small problem. I’m afraid you’ll have to die first.”\n\n\nThe lord of the tower then marches towards you, towering over you and looking down on you with malice in his eyes.\n\n\n“Ask him to chop your head off first. I’ll tell you what to do after that.”\n\n\n“Now then peasant,” The wizard says. “How would you like to die?”\n","page 364":"“That’s it?” The wizard asks. “Well that’s not very creative, is it?” The lord of the tower seems rather disappointed, but he shrugs his shoulders and accepts your request anyway. “Very well, let me conjure up a bow.” He then performs some sort of summoning spell and a bow appears in one hand with an arrow in the other. Taking aim, the wizard shoots the arrow at you and it pierces your heart.\n","page 125":"A riddle made out of numbers? How’re you supposed to solve that? If only they were letters instead.\n","page 246":"The lord of the tower lets out a rather disappointed sigh. “Really? With a sword? Couldn’t you think of something a little more original? Getting eaten alive by rabid chipmunks maybe? No? Oh very well, I did say you could choose.” And with that, the wizard draws his sword and in an instant your head is detached from your body and rolls across the floor.\n\n\n“Ouch! Sorry about that. Now try again.”\n","page 367":"“Hmm…” The wizard thinks about your request for a moment. “Not the most creative death but I suppose it will do.” Suddenly the wizard starts making these strange and rather creepy hissing noises. You wonder what on earth he’s doing until suddenly you feel something cold and scaly rubbing against your leg. Well, it looks like the wizard can summon snakes. Before you have time to move the snake sinks its teeth into your leg and you’re left writhing in agony as the poison slowly seeps through your body before finally killing you.\n","page 124":"The ghost jester raises an eyebrow at you “Eight hundred and fifty two?” He asks, looking utterly baffled. “Eight hundred and fifty two? There’s only twenty six of them! You don’t have any idea what I was talking about do you? Of course you don’t, you’re an idiot! Don’t worry though, I’ve got lots of riddles for idiots. Lots and lots and lots! I could tell them all day! Infact, I think I will!” With that, the jester pulls a cord that hangs close by the chair. It looks like a cord used to ring for servants, but instead, once the cord is pulled, a large cage drops down from a hidden compartment in the ceiling. It just misses chopping your hand off, but does fall exactly around where you stand, trapping you with no way of escape.\n\n\nThe jester does a few cartwheels around the cage before sitting himself down in front of you. “What’s brown and sticky?” He asks, but doesn’t really give you a chance to answer before he yells out, “A stick!” Giggling at his own joke, the jester folds his legs and leans forward to ask you another. “What do you call a fish with no eyes?” Again you don’t get a chance to reply before the jester answers for you. “A fsh!”\n\n\nIt turns out the jester was lying when he said he could tell these jokes all day. Infact he tells them all day and all through the night, and all the way through the next day as well, and you swear each joke is worse than the next. This horrible torture continues until you eventually die of starvation and thirst. The last thing you hear before you close your eyes is “Oh, I’ve got a good one! Why didn’t the ghost go to the party?”\n\n\nYou know, you know… Because he had no body to go with.\n","page 245":"The wizard lets out a devilish laugh. “Perfect! That’s my favorite spell you know! I love how the lightning feels in the palm of my hand, it just makes your fingers feel all tingly!” With that said, the wizard starts conjuring the spell and you can see the electricity running up and down his fingers before he hurls a bolt of lightning your way and you are fried to a crisp.\n","page 366":"The lord of the tower seems utterly delighted by your choice. “Oh! A bottomless hole! That’s a tricky one! Let’s see if I can pull this off!” With that the wizard begins his spell and after some chanting and elaborate hand flailing the ground opens up beneath you and you fall screaming for the longest time, but unfortunately it turns out this hole isn’t quite bottomless and eventually you do hit the ground and die.\n","page 127":"With all three men safely on the other side of the river, you hear the little girl squeal with delight. “Yey! I done it! I done it! I finished the game!” You feel a little ticked off at her bragging considering you did all the work, but at least the riddle is solved and the child uses whatever magical powers she possesses to change you back to your normal size.\n\n\n“Thank you for playing with me! I think I’ll get some rest now. Have fun playing riddles with Daddy!” Instead of taking a nap in the bed though, the girl walks over to the collection of life sized puppets and sits down amongst them. Staring at the puppets for awhile, you realize the girl is so still she’s not even breathing and on closer inspection you find that she is not a child at all, but an unbelievable life like wooden doll. Whoever this mad master of the tower is, he’s made himself his own toy children just to play riddles with him. The man seems creepier by the minute and you do hope your paths don’t cross before you find your way out of here.\n\n\nWell, on to the next room with you! After leaving the doll’s nursery you follow another hallway and descend yet more stairs to arrive in a large room that is practically empty save for a long, red carpet leading to a large and rather fancy looking chair. This must be where the lord of the tower used to do all his important lordly work, before he went mad and cursed the entire tower of course.\n\n\nSuddenly you hear a strange, manic kind of laughter coming from behind you, but before you can turn around you feel a horrible shiver of cold running through your body as a strange ghost does a cartwheel through your body. This ghost is dressed in blue and green motley complete with a little hat with bells on, which give him away to be the tower’s jester. After some more cartwheels, rolls and assorted acrobatics, the jester takes a seat at the foot of the chair where his master used to sit.\n\n\n“Hahaha! I knew you’d be here! Master told me you’d come he did, but he never said you’d be so ugly!” You decide rather quickly to yourself that this is not a particularly funny jester. “He sent me with a riddle he did! A clever little riddle it is. You listen careful now, ‘cos I’ll only say it once.\"\n\n\nYou’ve been doing pretty well with the riddles so far, so you expect solving this one shouldn’t be too much trouble. Much to your frustration though, rather than reciting a riddle as the jester promised, he starts giving you a long list of numbers.\n\n\n“23/8/1/20   8/1/19   1   8/5/1/4,   1   20/1/9/12,   9/19   2/18/15/23/14,   2/21/20   8/1/19   14/15   12/5/7/19.”\n\n\nWell, this is frustrating.

Come on, after all those riddles I solved, I at least deserve a fair fight!”\n\n\nThe wizard thinks about this a moment before reluctantly agreeing. “Oh very well, a fair fight it is!” He then uses his magic to conjure up a sword which he throws to you and you manage to catch by the hilt. “Alright peasant, show me what you can...\"\n\n\n“Not a chance!” You interrupt the wizard before he can finish his sentence, tossing the sword he gave you to the floor.\n\n\nThe lord of the tower glares down at you, looking like he’s about to burst with anger at your impudence. “You think you can beat me without a sword, peasant?”\n\n\n“I don’t want to fight you with a sword. I want to fight you in a duel that you could never hope to win. I challenge you to a game of riddles!”\n\n\nFor a moment there is nothing but silence before the wizard erupts with a bellow of laughter. “Riddles?” He asks. “You want to challenge me to riddles? My dear peasant, I am the very master of riddles! My entire tower is full of them!”\n\n\n“I know.” You answer with a smirk. “And I solved them all. I’d say I’ve more then proven that I can solve your riddles, but I bet you can’t solve mine.”\n\n\nThe wizard seems intrigued by that suggestion and finally gives in. “Very well, little peasant. Have it your way. Ask me your question and we’ll see who is the master of riddles once and for all!”\n","page 126":"With all three men safely on the other side of the river, you hear the little girl squeal with delight. “Yey!

Suddenly the form of a young woman with long red curls slowly starts to appear in front of you. At first you think it’s another ghost but the figure gradually solidifies until you see that she is infact very much alive.\n\n\n“I’m sorry for everything that’s happened.” The girl tells you. “You know, all that dying you had to do. It didn’t look pleasant. Still, I thank you so much! I could never repay you for all you’ve done! I’ve been a prisoner in the loop of time for so many years, but now my evil uncle is finally dead, and I can reclaim my rightful place as the lady of the tower.”\n\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, looking rather annoyed. “Wait, so you’re the rightful ruler of the tower, but it was stolen from you by your evil uncle? That’s a bit of an overused cliché, don’t you think?”\n\n\nThe girl folds her arms. “I could spend a few dozen paragraphs coming up with a long, detailed background story if you like. Do you want this game to end or not?”\n\n\n“No, I do!” You object, throwing your hands up in the air in submission. “I really, REALLY do!”\n\n\n“Good.” She says with a satisfied smile. “I’ll have to give you some kind of reward for all your troubles. Well, the doors are open again. Looks like you can finally go home.”\n\n\nTurning to the wide, open doors, you breathe in the fresh air before heading into the warm glow of sunlight.\n\n\n“One last thing!” The girl calls to you before you leave. “What was the answer to your riddle anyway?”\n\n\n“Oh that?” You say with a mischievous grin. “No idea. I just made it up.”\n","page 250":"“Hmm…” The wizard thinks about your request for a moment. “Not the most creative death but I suppose it will do.” Suddenly the wizard starts making these strange and rather creepy hissing noises. You wonder what on earth he’s doing until suddenly you feel something cold and scaly rubbing against your leg. Well, it looks like the wizard can summon snakes. Before you have time to move the snake sinks its teeth into your leg and you’re left writhing in agony as the poison slowly seeps through your body before finally killing you.\n","page 371":"For the longest time the wizard remains silent as he contemplates your riddle. The longer he thinks about it the more frustrated he becomes and when he fixes you with a cold, hard stare, you know he cannot solve it.\n\n\n“Well the joke’s on you peasant.” He tells you with a venomous tone. “Of course I can never lose a battle of wits, but that won’t happen if I never accept your challenge. Confused? Let me explain. You see my magic is so powerful that I’ve trapped this room in a loop of time. Whenever someone answers a riddle wrong, all they have to do is die and they’ll go back in time to before the riddle was even asked. So you see, I haven’t lost! After I die, I’ll go back in time and kill you before you ever ask your ridiculous question, and I’ll remain the lord of riddles for all eternity!”\n\n\nLaughing manically to himself, the wizard conjures up a ball of black fire which he throws down at his feet and continues to laugh even as the dark fire climbs up his armoured legs.\n\n\n“Oh yeah, I kind of figured that out already.” You tell him. “The whole trick where you have to die in eight different ways to break the loop. Those really hurt you know! And the hole wasn’t even bottomless.”\n\n\nAll those riddles you solved were all worth it for the horrified look in the wizard’s eyes right then. “What have you done?” He screams as the flames crawl up past his waist. “My time spell! No! This can’t happen!” The fire has almost engulfed the wizard now, and he starts frantically patting at the flames and rolling around on the ground to try and extinguish them. “No, no! Put me out! Put me out! Put me…” He screams once more like a stuck pig before the lord of the tower is roasted alive by his own magic flames and is left as nothing more than a pile of ash on the floor.\n","page 132":"You fill the pot with water. Nothing seems to happen but you’re not dead so apparently you haven’t done anything wrong… Yet. You take another look at the names on the list.\n\n\nJohn 2.7\n\n\nMark 9.41\n\n\nMatthew 27.24\n\n\nJoshua 3.15\n\n\nLuke 8.24\n\n\nWhat do you want to do next?\n","page 253":"Well, it\u0027s been fun, but this is the last ever hint you\u0027ll get from me... And it\u0027s another riddle! Why is it hard to find a baby polar bear in a snow storm?\n","page 131":"Suddenly you hear an eerie creaking sound which isn’t particularly comforting, followed by the loud scraping of stone against stone and after awhile the darkness around the table is broken when a stone wall covered in spikes starts heading your way. Apparently whatever you just did wasn’t what you were supposed to do. You turn around to get away from the spiky wall, but behind you another wall covered in spikes is heading your way. There doesn’t seem to be anything you can do to stop them and eventually one of the walls hits the table and starts pushing it towards you. You are forced to climb onto the table to avoid the spikes but this doesn’t do you any good since both walls push against the table so hard that it breaks beneath you, and you are crushed between two spike covered walls shortly after. It hurts.\n","page 252":"“Hey!” You object, looking rather frustrated by this whole situation. “You really think I’m just going to let you kill me? Come on, after all those riddles I solved, I at least deserve a fair fight!”\n\n\nThe wizard thinks about this a moment before reluctantly agreeing. “Oh very well, a fair fight it is!” He then uses his magic to conjure up a sword which he throws to you and you manage to catch by the hilt. “Alright peasant, show me what you can do!”\n\n\nThe fight that follows is hardly impressive. Mostly it’s just you swinging your sword around like a feather duster, while the wizard easily blocks your blows with his own blade. Obviously he’s not putting any effort into this battle. Infact he even lifts his head and lets out a yawn of obvious boredom.\n\n\nYou see your chance and take it. While the wizard’s head is tilted upward, you ram your sword through the small gap in his armor, into his neck! You’ve won! … Or at least you think you’ve won until the sword in your hand starts to fade away into the air, leaving not even a scratch on the wizard’s neck.\n\n\n“Well I suppose it wasn’t such a fair fight after all.” The evil lord remarks before shoving his sword right through your chest.\n\n\nYou drop to your knees, coughing a sputtering out blood and with your last, dying breath you yell out, “Cheater!”\n","page 373":"Well the Lady of the Tower finally came up with a reward for you and what does she give you? A little badge to put in your \"Choose your story\" profile to show that you beat the game... Wasn\u0027t really worth dying all those times for, was it? Oh well.\n\n\nCongrats for finishing! Let me know what you thought and I hope you enjoyed the game.\n","page 112":"With all three men safely on the other side of the river, you hear the little girl squeal with delight. “Yey! I done it! I done it! I finished the game!” You feel a little ticked off at her bragging considering you did all the work, but at least the riddle is solved and the child uses whatever magical powers she possesses to change you back to your normal size.\n\n\n“Thank you for playing with me! I think I’ll get some rest now. Have fun playing riddles with Daddy!” Instead of taking a nap in the bed though, the girl walks over to the collection of life sized puppets and sits down amongst them. Staring at the puppets for awhile, you realize the girl is so still she’s not even breathing and on closer inspection you find that she is not a child at all, but an unbelievable life like wooden doll. Whoever this mad master of the tower is, he’s made himself his own toy children just to play riddles with him. The man seems creepier by the minute and you do hope your paths don’t cross before you find your way out of here.\n\n\nWell, on to the next room with you! After leaving the doll’s nursery you follow another hallway and descend yet more stairs to arrive in a large room that is practically empty save for a long, red carpet leading to a large and rather fancy looking chair. This must be where the lord of the tower used to do all his important lordly work, before he went mad and cursed the entire tower of course.\n\n\nSuddenly you hear a strange, manic kind of laughter coming from behind you, but before you can turn around you feel a horrible shiver of cold running through your body as a strange ghost does a cartwheel through your body. This ghost is dressed in blue and green motley complete with a little hat with bells on, which give him away to be the tower’s jester. After some more cartwheels, rolls and assorted acrobatics, the jester takes a seat at the foot of the chair where his master used to sit.\n\n\n“Hahaha! I knew you’d be here! Master told me you’d come he did, but he never said you’d be so ugly!” You decide rather quickly to yourself that this is not a particularly funny jester. “He sent me with a riddle he did! A clever little riddle it is. You listen careful now, ‘cos I’ll only say it once.\"\n\n\nYou’ve been doing pretty well with the riddles so far, so you expect solving this one shouldn’t be too much trouble. Much to your frustration though, rather than reciting a riddle as the jester promised, he starts giving you a long list of numbers.\n\n\n“23/8/1/20   8/1/19   1   8/5/1/4,   1   20/1/9/12,   9/19   2/18/15/23/14,   2/21/20   8/1/19   14/15   12/5/7/19.”\n\n\nWell, this is frustrating. How are you supposed to answer that?\n","page 233":"… Okay, this feels really weird but you try to get yourself riled up and give the bowl of water a very angry glare. “You… Bad, bad water!” You rebuke it. “You start behaving right now or I’ll… Give you a stern warning and wag my finger at you! Then you’ll be sorry!”\n\n\nThe water doesn’t do anything noticeably different but after a few seconds you hear a loud creaking sound and a ray of light appears across the room as a secret door slowly swings open. Good work! Father Fitzgerald always told you it was important to learn your memory verses. Looks like he was right!\n\n\nThe door leads to another staircase, although this one somehow seems far scarier than all the rest. It’s almost pitch dark as you make your way down and the chill in the air seems almost unnatural. Several times you think you hear the squeaking and flapping of bats flying around above your head. Eventually you see a faint glow of light at the bottom of the stairs. As you follow it you find yourself in the most disturbing part of the tower so far. Even though you\u0027re in a tower, this room looks more like some kind of Mausoleum. Along the narrow halls are two rows of coffins. If this isn’t creepy enough, the only source of light in the room is coming from a single candle, and that candle is being held by a rather disturbingly looking pale man with raven hair, wearing a long, black cape. This man regards you quietly for a moment before giving you a wide grin, showing off his pointy teeth. This can’t be good.\n\n\n“Ahh, a guest! Velcome to my humble abode. It has been such a long time since ve had visitors. Vell I suppose ve should get down to business. My name is Vlad. Normally I vould be asleep at this hour, but my lord told me you vould be coming, and he asked me to vait for you to tell you a few things. You see there are twelve coffins in this room, yes? Vell I can tell you now that there are only eleven vampires in this room. One of the coffins is not a coffin at all, it is merely a doorway to the next room. Your task here is very simple. Figure out vhich door is empty and then go through it.”\n\n\nThe vampire then stretches his arms and lets out a yawn. “Now if you vill excuse me, I vill retire. I have not slept all day and there is a long night ahead of me you know.” With that the vampire hands you his candle and heads over to the third coffin on the left in the top row and shuts himself in to get some rest.\n\n\nWell, that wasn\u0027t very helpful. So far all you know is that Vlad is in coffin number three. Maybe you should look for more clues.\n","page 354":"The lord of the tower seems utterly delighted by your choice. “Oh! A bottomless hole! That’s a tricky one! Let’s see if I can pull this off!” With that the wizard begins his spell and after some chanting and elaborate hand flailing the ground opens up beneath you and you fall screaming for the longest time, but unfortunately it turns out this hole isn’t quite bottomless and eventually you do hit the ground and die.\n","page 111":"You row back to the island. On the island is the murderer. Who do you want to row back with?\n","page 232":"Vlad opens his coffin and looks rather annoyed that you\u0027re disturbing him while he\u0027s trying to get some sleep. \"Yes?\" He asks rather impatiently. \"Vhat do you vant?\"\n","page 353":"“Really?” Asks the wizard. “That seems like a strange way to want to die. Hanging’s usually a punishment reserved for murderers and bandits, but if that’s what you really want I suppose I could whip something up.” The lord of the tower then performs some sort of conjuring spell and suddenly you find yourself with a noose around your neck. The rope is swung over a chandelier that hangs from the ceiling with the other end falling down into the wizard’s hands. “Goodbye little peasant.” And with that, the wizard tugs on the rope and you are lifted into the air by your neck. You struggle and squirm and pull at the rope around your neck, but eventually you are choked to death.\n","page 114":"The jester ghost gives a disappointed and rather childish looking pout at your answer. “Awhh, you got it wrong.” He whines sulkily, but then quickly cheers up as he jumps to his feet and walks over to you with a big smile on his face. “Tell you what, since I like you I’ll give you a second riddle, how’s that?”\n\n\nAfraid that he’ll do another cartwheel through you, you start backing away from the ghost towards the wall, which only seems to make him smile more. You are relieved that the next riddle is spoken in words rather than numbers. “What has no brains, a face like an arse, screams like a little girl and can’t fly?” You’re actually dumb enough to think about this for a moment.

A little girl’s room, painted pink with little purple curtains draped over a little bed and more toys than a princess could ask for. Dollhouses complete with furniture and little tea sets for the dolls, rocking horses, every kind of toy animal you can think of and the most incredibly life like puppets.\n\n\nIn the centre of the room is a table on which sits a little model village. On one side of the village is a little river with an island in the middle. There are three men and a little boat on the island.\n\n\n“Have you come to play with me?” You hear a little voice ask, and you turn around to see a young girl, about five years old, dressed up in a pretty green dress with a crown of flowers in her hair. Apparently the girl fancies herself a bit of a princess. Unlike the rest of the people in this tower though, the girl is not a ghost. Everything about her seems completely real. “I’ve been trying to finish this game for ages.” She tells you, standing up on a stool to get a better view of the model village. “My Daddy gave it to me. He says only a real smart person can figure it out.” The child then turns to you and considers you for a moment. “You don’t look very smart.” She says sadly. “But I’ll let you play anyway.”\n\n\nBefore you can either agree or object, you suddenly find yourself shrinking down to the size of a little toy soldier. Rather carelessly, the girl picks you up between her thumb and forefinger and drops you on the little model island.\n\n\n“Now listen carefully.” The girl tells you with a rather bossy tone. “There’s three men on the island. The ugly one is a bad man who threw a lady in the river and drowned her. The angry one is the lady’s brother, and he’s very cross with the bad man for killing her. The scared looking man saw the ugly one drown the lady, he’s very scared because he thinks the bad man is going to kill him too, so that he won’t tell anybody what happened. You are the ferry man and you have to get all three of the men to the village so that they can take the bad man to court, but you can only take one man at a time. You can’t leave the lady’s brother alone with the bad man, or the lady’s brother might get angry and kill him. Also, you can’t leave the bad man alone with the scared man, because if you do then the bad man might kill the scared man so that he can’t tell anyone what happened.

Infact he even lifts his head and lets out a yawn of obvious boredom.\n\n\nYou see your chance and take it. While the wizard’s head is tilted upward, you ram your sword through the small gap in his armor, into his neck! You’ve won! … Or at least you think you’ve won until the sword in your hand starts to fade away into the air, leaving not even a scratch on the wizard’s neck.\n\n\n“Well I suppose it wasn’t such a fair fight after all.” The evil lord remarks before shoving his sword right through your chest.\n\n\nYou drop to your knees, coughing a sputtering out blood and with your last, dying breath you yell out, “Cheater!”\n","page 163":"Suddenly you hear an eerie creaking sound which isn’t particularly comforting, followed by the loud scraping of stone against stone and after awhile the darkness around the table is broken when a stone wall covered in spikes starts heading your way. Apparently whatever you just did wasn’t what you were supposed to do. You turn around to get away from the spiky wall, but behind you another wall covered in spikes is heading your way. There doesn’t seem to be anything you can do to stop them and eventually one of the walls hits the table and starts pushing it towards you. You are forced to climb onto the table to avoid the spikes but this doesn’t do you any good since both walls push against the table so hard that it breaks beneath you, and you are crushed between two spike covered walls shortly after. It hurts.\n","page 283":"Just as you are about to reach the exit, the doors slam shut and you can hear cruel, manic laughter coming from behind you.

Clad from head to toe in armour, holding a giant sword in his hand and… Is that a skull on his breastplate? Yes, this man is defiantly “Evil Lord” material.\n\n\n \n\n“Congratulations!” The man cheers, applauding you with his mail clad hands. “None of the peasants I’ve had brought to my tower have ever made it this far before.

I’m afraid your path ends here.”\n\n\n“Hello?” A soft voice gently whispers. “Hello, can you hear me?”\n\n\nAs the Evil lord speaks, you think you can hear a very faint sound of whispering. You try to make out what’s being said but the noise is cut off when the Evil Lord resumes his little rant. “You see peasant, there is no escape from this tower. Once you enter your life is mine to do with as I please! I have all the darkest magic at my disposal. I could make you my ghostly slave, or an undead guard for my fortress, or I could always just feed you to my vampires. Still, since you have come so far, I think you’ve earned yourself a reward, yes?”\n\n\n“Listen to me! The wizard has trapped this room in a loop of time!”\n\n\nYou think you can hear whispering again, but it’s so faint that trying to make out the words is like trying to find a baby polar bear in a snow storm. “Are you listening to me peasant? Here is the reward I offer you. You have impressed me so much, that I will allow you to choose the way you die!”\n\n\n“This is a trick! Don’t try fighting him, you’ll only end up back here again!”\n\n\nThere’s that whispering again. You think they said something about fighting him. “Oh, but it’s got to be something creative though. It’s been so long since I’ve got to show off my magic. Let me summon a fire ball or strike you down with lightning or something. Nothing boring like asking me to chop of your head with my sword of anything like that.\n\n\n“Don\u0027t worry, you can escape, but there’s a small problem. I’m afraid you’ll have to die first.”\n\n\nThe lord of the tower then marches towards you, towering over you and looking down on you with malice in his eyes.\n\n\n“Ask him to chop your head off first. I’ll tell you what to do after that.”\n\n\n“Now then peasant,” The wizard says. “How would you like to die?”\n","page 165":"… Okay, this feels really weird but you try to get yourself riled up and give the bowl of water a very angry glare. “You… Bad, bad water!” You rebuke it. “You start behaving right now or I’ll… Give you a stern warning and wag my finger at you!

This is the latest entry:\n\n\nIt\u0027s been almost a month since I was turned now, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get used to this. I always assumed that when I\u0027d die, I\u0027d just die. I never thought I\u0027d become something else. I suppose it\u0027s not all bad though. The vampires that I share this tower with aren\u0027t so bad as the stories say. Some of them seem nice enough and some of them are jerks, just like humans really.\n\n\nVlad seems to be the leader. He\u0027s the one who turned me, though I have no idea why and to be honest I\u0027m too nervous to talk to him. The other vampires all seem to treat him with a great deal of respect, except maybe for Nyx, who is the single most unbelievably annoying individual I have ever met and drives all the others insane with his manic cackling and unfunny jokes.\n\n\nLestat and Fang are friendly enough. They were brothers when they were alive but it\u0027s hard to get to know them as individuals since they\u0027re constantly together. They eat together and hunt together and of course their coffins are right next to each other. The only real differences between them is that Lestat is a naturally talented bard and often entertains the others while poor Fang always gets stuck doing all the dirty jobs around here that the others seem to think are beneath them.\n\n\nI\u0027m not too keen on Salem or Bones. I have no idea what I did but Salem\u0027s really got it in for me. I suppose it\u0027s because I\u0027m the \"new guy\" and he doesn\u0027t feel like I\u0027m one of them yet. Bones hasn\u0027t really done anything wrong he just looks and acts really creepy, though he seems to spend most of his time following the girls around, so he doesn\u0027t bother me all that much.\n\n\nSpeaking of girls, the females in this place are insane! Not Shadow, she\u0027s a nice girl and she\u0027s been trying to help me feel at home since I got here. I suppose she\u0027s quite pretty too, but not like Raven! Where do I start with Raven? In all my life she is the most beautiful woman I\u0027ve ever laid eyes on, with full red lips and black hair so long that it trails along the floor behind her, but I swear that woman is a cold hearted witch! She seems to consider herself some kind of vampire royalty and looks down on me like I was something on the bottom of her shoe.\n\n\nMidnight just freaks me out. It\u0027s not really her fault I suppose but the thing is, Midnight was bitten and turned into a vampire when she was 8, but that was almost 40 years ago now and she has a rather unhealthy interest in men. It\u0027s really awkward because I am constantly getting flirted with by a middle aged woman in the body of a child. It\u0027s just creepy! Then there\u0027s the woman who sleeps opposite me in coffin number 4. Now she is crazy personified! The other vampires are like humans in that they hunt because they\u0027re hungry. Mary is more bloodthirsty than a river full of leeches. No one really talks to her because as soon as the sun sets, Bloody Mary goes out on an all night killing spree and doesn\u0027t return until just before the sunrise with her fangs dripping blood. I swear it sends a shiver down my spine every time I look at her, urgh!\n","page 188":"… Okay, this feels really weird but you try to get yourself riled up and give the bowl of water a very angry glare. “You… Bad, bad water!” You rebuke it. “You start behaving right now or I’ll… Give you a stern warning and wag my finger at you!

I know it\u0027s a strange request but you\u0027d be doing me a huge favor. Ever since Bones declared his undying love for Raven and she shot him down, he\u0027s been turning his attentions to me and to be honest, I\u0027m starting to find it really creepy. His unwanted affection would be a lot easier to handle if Bones wasn\u0027t sleeping in the coffin next to me. I\u0027m asking you not just because your coffin is the furthest away from Bones, but I figured it would help you out too since your coffin just happens to be next to the most annoying vampire in the world. Also if you switched with me you\u0027d be right next to the new guy and I know you want to keep an eye on him. Personally I don\u0027t think you have anything to worry about. The boy seems fine to me, I think he just needs time to adjust, like we all did when we were first turned. Try to be more easy going with him, let him know he\u0027s one of us now.\n\n\nShadow\n","page 183":"… Okay, this feels really weird but you try to get yourself riled up and give the bowl of water a very angry glare. “You… Bad, bad water!” You rebuke it. “You start behaving right now or I’ll… Give you a stern warning and wag my finger at you!

You go on through the door now.” And with that, the rocking chair stops rocking and the ghost of the woman and her cat fade away into nothingness.\n\n\nOpening the door leads you to a staircase. As you descend these stairs you can hear all sorts of strange noises. Scuffling, squeaking, flapping of wings, hooting and howling, you expect to find a collection of animals caged at the bottom of the stairs. Instead you find a circular room with ten doors all the way around, each with a picture of a different animal engraved on the door.\n\n\nThe noises begin to quiet down and the ghost of a dark haired, rather scruffy looking man appears in the centre of the room with a hawk perched on his arm. “So, you made it past Nana did you? Poor old bat’s been trying to solve that riddle for damn near fifty years now. Well I suppose it’s my turn then. Glad to meet you kid. I’m the games keeper here abouts.

Did you put together the first letters of every sentence or was it just a lucky guess? Either way I suppose it’s time for me to move on. Good luck with the next riddle, but watch yourself. I hear there’s a killer on the loose in the tower.” You want to ask the game keeper more but by the time you turn around both the man and the hawk have already vanished.\n\n\nThe doorway leads to a large dining hall with one great table, decorated with candles and long enough to host a royal banquet. The plates, cutlery and candle sticks are all covered in dust and all the seats are empty save for the last five at the far end, all of which are filled by ghosts.\n\n\nTwo men sit on the left of the table and two women on the right. Judging by their clothing they are all servants of different standing within the tower, but at the head of the table sits a young woman about your own age, just barely into adulthood. Both her fine velvet dress and the refined way she sits show her to be a woman of noble birth.\n\n\n“Have you come to free me from my torment?” The noble woman asks as a ghostly tear runs down her cheek. “My father sent me here to become the Wizard Lord’s bride, but while I was a guest in his tower, the scoundrel had me poisoned by one of his own servants. I cannot be free until I know who my killer is. All I know is that it is one of the four sitting at the table, and that only one of them ever speaks the truth.”\n\n\nIn unison the four servants all turn to you and begin to argue in their defence.\n\n\n“The maid is the murderer.” Says the butler.\n\n\n“The cook poisoned the princess.” Says the maid.\n\n\n“I didn’t kill the girl, I swear!” Says the gardener.\n\n\n“The maid is lying.” Says the cook.\n","page 21":"You press the engraved stone and a secret door in the stone wall gradually slides to one side and reveals a hidden passage way.

Eventually you see a light at the end of the passage and find yourself in a room dimly lit by torches that hang from the wall. The room is small with only a spinning wheel and an old rocking chair to decorate it, both of which are coated in cob webs. There is a door on the other side of the room.\n\n\nHaving nowhere else to go, you head towards the door when suddenly you hear the creaking of the rocking chair behind you. For a brief moment you hold your breath and try to reassure yourself that it’s just the breeze rocking the chair, but there is no breeze in the room. Eventually you force yourself to turn around and see the ghostly figure of an old woman sitting in the chair.\n\n\nBefore you can run or scream, the old lady speaks up in a gentle yet eerie voice. “No need to be afraid of me child.” She tells you as she slowly rocks in her chair, stroking a small, ghostly cat on her lap. “You’ve nothing to fear from poor old Nana. I’m just here, pondering the old riddle to myself. Are you good at riddles child? I do hope so.

If this isn’t creepy enough, the only source of light in the room is coming from a single candle, and that candle is being held by a rather disturbingly looking pale man with raven hair, wearing a long, black cape. This man regards you quietly for a moment before giving you a wide grin, showing off his pointy teeth. This can’t be good.\n\n\n“Ahh, a guest! Velcome to my humble abode.

Vell I can tell you now that there are only eleven vampires in this room. One of the coffins is not a coffin at all, it is merely a doorway to the next room. Your task here is very simple. Figure out vhich door is empty and then go through it.”\n\n\nThe vampire then stretches his arms and lets out a yawn. “Now if you vill excuse me, I vill retire. I have not slept all day and there is a long night ahead of me you know.” With that the vampire hands you his candle and heads over to the third coffin on the left in the top row and shuts himself in to get some rest.\n\n\nWell, that wasn\u0027t very helpful. So far all you know is that Vlad is in coffin number three.

It grows and grows until the chant is finally done and the wizard hurls the fire ball your way. You of course are consumed by the flames and die screaming in agony.\n","page 314":"“That’s it?” The wizard asks. “Well that’s not very creative, is it?” The lord of the tower seems rather disappointed, but he shrugs his shoulders and accepts your request anyway. “Very well, let me conjure up a bow.” He then performs some sort of summoning spell and a bow appears in one hand with an arrow in the other.

Hanging’s usually a punishment reserved for murderers and bandits, but if that’s what you really want I suppose I could whip something up.” The lord of the tower then performs some sort of conjuring spell and suddenly you find yourself with a noose around your neck. The rope is swung over a chandelier that hangs from the ceiling with the other end falling down into the wizard’s hands. “Goodbye little peasant.” And with that, the wizard tugs on the rope and you are lifted into the air by your neck. You struggle and squirm and pull at the rope around your neck, but eventually you are choked to death.\n","page 44":"This riddle is pretty straight forward.

Once you enter your life is mine to do with as I please! I have all the darkest magic at my disposal. I could make you my ghostly slave, or an undead guard for my fortress, or I could always just feed you to my vampires. Still, since you have come so far, I think you’ve earned yourself a reward, yes?”\n\n\n\"I am, in truth, a yellow fork from tables in the sky.\"\n\n\nYou think you can hear whispering again, but it’s so faint that trying to make out the words is like trying to find a baby polar bear in a snow storm. “Are you listening to me peasant? Here is the reward I offer you. You have impressed me so much, that I will allow you to choose the way you die!”\n\n\n\"By inadvertent fingers dropped the awful cutlery.\"\n\n\nThere’s that whispering again. You think they said something about fighting him. “Oh, but it’s got to be something creative though. It’s been so long since I’ve got to show off my magic.

Nothing boring like asking me to chop of your head with my sword of anything like that.\n\n\n\"Of mansions never quite disclosed and never quite concealed.\"\n\n\nThe lord of the tower then marches towards you, towering over to you and looking down on you with malice in his eyes.\n\n\n\"The apparatus of the dark to ignorance revealed.\"\n\n\n“Now then peasant,” The wizard says. “How would you like to die?”\n","page 104":"You row back to the village.

Well, that’s what you get for trying to be clever!\n","page 213":"… Okay, this feels really weird but you try to get yourself riled up and give the bowl of water a very angry glare. “You… Bad, bad water!” You rebuke it. “You start behaving right now or I’ll… Give you a stern warning and wag my finger at you!

Looks like he was right!\n\n\nThe door leads to another staircase, although this one somehow seems far scarier than all the rest. It’s almost pitch dark as you make your way down and the chill in the air seems almost unnatural. Several times you think you hear the squeaking and flapping of bats flying around above your head. Eventually you see a faint glow of light at the bottom of the stairs. As you follow it you find yourself in the most disturbing part of the tower so far. Even though you\u0027re in a tower, this room looks more like some kind of Mausoleum. Along the narrow halls are two rows of coffins. If this isn’t creepy enough, the only source of light in the room is coming from a single candle, and that candle is being held by a rather disturbingly looking pale man with raven hair, wearing a long, black cape. This man regards you quietly for a moment before giving you a wide grin, showing off his pointy teeth. This can’t be good.\n\n\n“Ahh, a guest! Velcome to my humble abode. It has been such a long time since ve had visitors. Vell I suppose ve should get down to business. My name is Vlad. Normally I vould be asleep at this hour, but my lord told me you vould be coming, and he asked me to vait for you to tell you a few things. You see there are twelve coffins in this room, yes? Vell I can tell you now that there are only eleven vampires in this room. One of the coffins is not a coffin at all, it is merely a doorway to the next room. Your task here is very simple. Figure out vhich door is empty and then go through it.”\n\n\nThe vampire then stretches his arms and lets out a yawn. “Now if you vill excuse me, I vill retire. I have not slept all day and there is a long night ahead of me you know.” With that the vampire hands you his candle and heads over to the third coffin on the left in the top row and shuts himself in to get some rest.\n\n\nWell, that wasn\u0027t very helpful. So far all you know is that Vlad is in coffin number three. Maybe you should look for more clues.\n","page 334":"Just as you are about to reach the exit, the doors slam shut and you can hear cruel, manic laughter coming from behind you. Well, you should have seen this coming, you really, really should. Reluctantly turning around, you find yourself face to face with the most menacing looking individual you’ve ever come across. Clad from head to toe in armour, holding a giant sword in his hand and… Is that a skull on his breastplate? Yes, this man is defiantly “Evil Lord” material.\n\n\n\"You know what I just realized? The wizard can\u0027t hear a word I\u0027m saying!\"\n\n\n“Congratulations!” The man cheers, applauding you with his mail clad hands. “None of the peasants I’ve had brought to my tower have ever made it this far before. I must thank you stranger, I was starting to grow very bored. Finally, a subject worthy of my riddles! I’m almost tempted to let you go… But no! I’m afraid your path ends here.”\n\n\n\"That means I can make fun of him behind his back!\"\n\n\nAs the Evil lord speaks, you think you can hear a very faint sound of whispering. You try to make out what’s being said but the noise is cut off when the Evil Lord resumes his little rant. “You see peasant, there is no escape from this tower. Once you enter your life is mine to do with as I please! I have all the darkest magic at my disposal. I could make you my ghostly slave, or an undead guard for my fortress, or I could always just feed you to my vampires. Still, since you have come so far, I think you’ve earned yourself a reward, yes?”\n\n\n\"Look at me! I\u0027m a big evil wizard! I\u0027m so ugly I have to wear a helmet indoors!\"\n\n\nYou think you can hear whispering again, but it’s so faint that trying to make out the words is like trying to find a baby polar bear in a snow storm. “Are you listening to me peasant? Here is the reward I offer you. You have impressed me so much, that I will allow you to choose the way you die!”\n\n\n\"Are you listening to me peasant? Blah, blah, blah! I\u0027m SO important!\"\n\n\nThere’s that whispering again. You think they said something about fighting him. “Oh, but it’s got to be something creative though. It’s been so long since I’ve got to show off my magic. Let me summon a fire ball or strike you down with lightning or something. Nothing boring like asking me to chop of your head with my sword of anything like that.\n\n\n\"I like to use really big magic tricks, \u0027cos I\u0027m compensating for something REALLY small!\"\n\n\nThe lord of the tower then marches towards you, towering over to you and looking down on you with malice in his eyes.\n\n\n\"Oh right, the riddle! What goes up but never comes down?\"\n\n\n“Now then peasant,” The wizard says. “How would you like to die?”\n","page 212":"Vlad does not look impressed. \"No.\" He tells you rather sternly. \"No it is not. Now go avay!\" He then slams his door in your face. Maybe you should look at the clues some more.\n","page 333":"Well, it\u0027s been fun, but this is the last ever hint you\u0027ll get from me...

It grows and grows until the chant is finally done and the wizard hurls the fire ball your way. You of course are consumed by the flames and die screaming in agony.\n","page 214":"… Okay, this feels really weird but you try to get yourself riled up and give the bowl of water a very angry glare. “You… Bad, bad water!” You rebuke it. “You start behaving right now or I’ll… Give you a stern warning and wag my finger at you!

Couldn’t you think of something a little more original? Getting eaten alive by rabid chipmunks maybe? No?

Well, that went well.\n","page 339":"“That’s it?” The wizard asks. “Well that’s not very creative, is it?” The lord of the tower seems rather disappointed, but he shrugs his shoulders and accepts your request anyway. “Very well, let me conjure up a bow.” He then performs some sort of summoning spell and a bow appears in one hand with an arrow in the other. Taking aim, the wizard shoots the arrow at you and it pierces your heart.\n","page 68":"Well the evil lord of the tower sure knows his European languages.

You open the door and the guard kindly steps aside to let you pass. “Addio piccola persona!” He calls after you. “Cercate di non morire in un modo brutto!”\n\n\nThe next room is a rather cheerful change of pace in this otherwise rather depressing haunted tower. A little girl’s room, painted pink with little purple curtains draped over a little bed and more toys than a princess could ask for. Dollhouses complete with furniture and little tea sets for the dolls, rocking horses, every kind of toy animal you can think of and the most incredibly life like puppets.\n\n\nIn the centre of the room is a table on which sits a little model village. On one side of the village is a little river with an island in the middle. There are three men and a little boat on the island.\n\n\n“Have you come to play with me?” You hear a little voice ask, and you turn around to see a young girl, about five years old, dressed up in a pretty green dress with a crown of flowers in her hair. Apparently the girl fancies herself a bit of a princess. Unlike the rest of the people in this tower though, the girl is not a ghost. Everything about her seems completely real. “I’ve been trying to finish this game for ages.” She tells you, standing up on a stool to get a better view of the model village. “My Daddy gave it to me. He says only a real smart person can figure it out.” The child then turns to you and considers you for a moment. “You don’t look very smart.” She says sadly. “But I’ll let you play anyway.”\n\n\nBefore you can either agree or object, you suddenly find yourself shrinking down to the size of a little toy soldier. Rather carelessly, the girl picks you up between her thumb and forefinger and drops you on the little model island.\n\n\n“Now listen carefully.” The girl tells you with a rather bossy tone. “There’s three men on the island. The ugly one is a bad man who threw a lady in the river and drowned her. The angry one is the lady’s brother, and he’s very cross with the bad man for killing her. The scared looking man saw the ugly one drown the lady, he’s very scared because he thinks the bad man is going to kill him too, so that he won’t tell anybody what happened. You are the ferry man and you have to get all three of the men to the village so that they can take the bad man to court, but you can only take one man at a time. You can’t leave the lady’s brother alone with the bad man, or the lady’s brother might get angry and kill him. Also, you can’t leave the bad man alone with the scared man, because if you do then the bad man might kill the scared man so that he can’t tell anyone what happened. Now, who are you going to take first?”\n","page 60":"You look accusingly at each of the servants and consider what they each said in turn. “You say that only one of them can tell the truth. Now the only one that can be telling the truth while all the others are lying is the cook, and since the gardener claims he didn’t do it and we know he must be lying, that must make him the killer!” With that, the four servants all begin to disappear into the air. You have solved their riddle and now they can finally move on to the afterlife.\n\n\n“Thank you.” The ghost of the noblewoman tells you as she begins to fade away. “Finally I can rest in peace. I wish you luck on your next riddle. I hear it can only be solved by one with the sharpest of eyes.”\n\n\nOnce the woman’s ghost has faded from sight you leave the dining hall and descend another spiral staircase until you find yourself in a long passageway that seems to wind in a circle around the tower. All across the walls hang the most incredible works of art. Landscapes and seascapes and portraits of lords and ladies dressed in shimmering silks, all painted with exquisite attention to detail. There is one painting that draws your eye though, a strange pattern made up of purple roses which would look very pretty on a pair of curtains but seems incredibly out of place hanging on the wall with the other paintings.\n\n\n“Ah, I zee you are admiring my masterpiece.” A voice speaks from behind you and you turn to see a ghost of a man standing behind you dressed in a brightly coloured tunic, holding a paint palette in one hand and a brush in another. “Oh ze hours I slaved avay on zis painting and ze mastery, it iz vasted on blind fools!

The rope is swung over a chandelier that hangs from the ceiling with the other end falling down into the wizard’s hands. “Goodbye little peasant.” And with that, the wizard tugs on the rope and you are lifted into the air by your neck. You struggle and squirm and pull at the rope around your neck, but eventually you are choked to death.\n"}
