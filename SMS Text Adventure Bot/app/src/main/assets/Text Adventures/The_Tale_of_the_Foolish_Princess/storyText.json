  "page 122": "Zeska would be perhaps the toughest foe that the weapon had faced. This wasn\u0027t a battle under the duress of the conditions of a chaotic war, but a duel between two on opposing sides of the other. At a time, Sophia may have feared for her life and thought this a foe impossible to topple, but more than one thousand days had passed, and she was no longer that person. However, this still didn\u0027t change the fact that the woman whom carried a behemoth of a weapon around like it weighed little more than paper, would outclass her if she tried any means that required the physical aspect of a fight.\n\n\nSo when the weapon is swung, Sophia only raises her hand, conjuring a dark haze of smoke that would bubble around the woman\u0027s head, causing her weapon to hit the ground, only grazing her slightly to cause a small tear in her rather expensive in material robes. Unlike most, Zeska would have grown a resistance to such magic, but Sophia carried with her a concealed knife which she stabs though the woman\u0027s throat. There was no time to dabble in the pleasantries of such a thing as mercy and giving one a dignified death. \n\n\nShe drives the small blade in repeatedly, watching as the woman gurgled on her own blood, but still had enough strength to lift her off the ground with a punch that went underneath her chin. The force of her head meeting the ground is enough to leave her momentarily dazed and unable to defend against the heavy boot that slams into her stomach.\n\n\n\"Urh... Peno..lope.. I promis... k-kill you.\" \n\n\nSophia thinks the woman to truly be a monster as she continues on despite her fatal wounds. Struggling to lift her sword with one hand as she clutched her profusely bleeding wound with the other. For a moment the queen thinks herself to be a dead woman when pressed into the ground like this, feeling absolutely hopeless and defenseless against such a foe. It could be argued that little changed, and although she had finally brought to the monster of a solider great injuries, this was still her defea--\n\n\n\"N-now or never, Juliette.\"\n\n\nWith those words, a well-timed arrow would meet its mark. The arrow itself burrowing through the head of the hard to kill Zeska, going through both ends of either side of her head and felling her. The woman still continued to twitch even as she bled profusely, but she finally does expire once Juliette mercilessly pulls her arrow out of the woman\u0027s with a fluid motion. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she voices to the woman, before her attention is back to Sophia, whom she offers a hand that the woman takes to pull herself off of the floor. \n\n\nIt\u0027s at that moment that another door opens from the room, and there stands Noel and Penelope Nevermore. They both hold the other\u0027s hand, and each take a moment to stare at Zeska\u0027s body sadly. There\u0027s regret in their faces as they continue their steps to meet their younger sister. There\u0027s no hint of anger, or a negative emotion to be seen on their either one of their faces. In fact, they look more regretful than anything, but there\u0027s a hint to their eyes that shows a belief that despite it all, it was worth it. \n\n\n\"There\u0027s plenty we have to explain to you, huh?\" Noel asks with a tired laugh.\n\n\n\"Such an understatement, Noel.\" Penelope playfully knocks into his shoulder with hers.\n\n\nThe young women only watch all the while. \n\n\n\"Please do.\" Both Sophia and Juliette say in unison.\n",

  "page 124": "Zeska Orlov is a fierce warrior of the king\u0027s royal guard. It\u0027s no secret that she was born a mere peasant, and a foreigner at that. Because of this fact, she had to harden herself to the world much quickly than others. Even as a child, she found herself being able to run much faster than the boys, and also outwrestle them. \n\n\nThis made her an outcast, and she was poor at that. Zeska would take to stealing to survive and feed herself. It\u0027s when she tries to steal from a girl similar to her age in Penelope Nevermore, does her life change. The guards that the girl was traveling with had beaten her to she was bruised lying down on the ground defenseless as a sword was about to come down and take off her head completely, but the knights were stopped by Penelope who wanted to take her in.\n\n\nDue to this, she\u0027s fiercely loyal to the girl. In her teenage years, she was stronger and faster than many of the men that made up the knights for Rose palace. Because of this Edmund Nevermore gave her a position at the lowest starting rank, which she quickly climbed up to become the captain of said knights itself.\n\n\nWith her sword, it\u0027s said that there\u0027s few individuals in the entire world that can best her in one-one-one combat.\n",
  "page 126": "-Year Twenty-\n\n\nSophia Nevermore saw it fit to expand her reach throughout two of the territory’s she now had in her control. In the span of two years, so much had changed. Once a sheltered princess, many were now calling her,\n\n\nQueen. And if her title was going to be updated, she figured Juliette go from being a simple attendant to her main advisor. Honestly speaking, she would have given her an even grander title if the woman hadn\u0027t argued so much against it. The teachings that were so very ingrained in her was certainly tough even for her to crack.\n\n\nSuch things were often as irritating as it was amusing. \n\n\nMoving on, Paul finally did get his new hand, It was made out of the toughest silver, and was imbued with magic so that it can move as good, if not better than his old. All in all, many people were happy to see him escape the clutches of death. Especially none other than the advisor Juliette Forthwight, and Evie Fayre. \n\n\nRoy was happy to be appointed students to train in the magical arts. A little known secret to nobody, not even Juliette, was that the queen herself was a student of his after dark. \n\n\nNo, no, no. Nothing improper was going on between the two of them. \n\n\nRoy was simply just amazing at magic. And through conversations, Sophia had found out he was younger than her. By a few months, but it was something to keep in mind. \n\n\nCurrently, she had enough aptitude to create one spell. \n\n\nThat was one more than she could ever do before.\n\n\nThere was still Caspar, who may or may not be dead. She had sent delegates weeks ago to the Holt Kingdom, it wouldn’t be long until they\u0027ve returned with the much needed information that she would need to make her next move.\n\n\n\"Queen Nevermore, the delegates have returned.\" It\u0027s the voice of one of her assistants that tells her this information. \n\n\nThe days in which only Juliette alerted her to such things had long been gone, as the woman had her only responsibilities that took her away from her side even more. Sophia had a feeling that although even she was away from her, she was working as efficiently as ever to re-join her side. She looks forward to being able to recount the different experiences of their day, but first there was pressing business to attend to. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll be right there,\" Sophia responds as she pushes herself away from her study. \n\n\n---\n\n\n\"We weren’t able to make contact with Caspar Holt, or the king, Eldred Holt. The man that is the acting king is the father of the king, Reginald Holt. He has requested that you travel out to personally meet him, so that he could supplement our forces with his!\" The delegate recounts. \n\n\nThere are excited murmurs that make up the sound of the room as Sophia thinks deeply on this. Why had no contact with either Caspar, or even his father have been unable to be made? \n\n\nSo many elements to worry about, and did she really have to worry about them? \n\n\nAt this point, Sophia Nevermore feels like she\u0027s more than proven that she could handle her own against anynoe that feels to take advantage of her. But another element that leaves her at a loss of just what to do exactly with this information is that she doesn\u0027t believe her older Noel or Rosemary would ever outright attack her. \n\n\nThey\u0027ve only shown her kindness throughout her life. None of their troops had sent warnings of a war. But still, there were so many questions left unanswered.\n\n\nTo find those answers, she would have to take the path of most resistant. \n\n\nEven after absorbing everything her recently departed siblings had to offer. Their funds, military, strength, infrastructure, she was sure that Noel and Rosemary had more in bulk. \n\n\nThe two of them was always so clever. Was she ready to risk life and limb again, or was there a different path she could take? \n",

There were times she looked at the mirror that she saw faces of those whose lives were extinguished in which she was either directly responsible for, or played a part in. It wasn\u0027t something she enjoyed, but that still did little to change the reality of the fact that the blood at her feet almost made it too difficult to walk. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re suffering. I can tell. I have a proposition for you. Become my woman and you won\u0027t have to walk this bloody path any longer. Forget about staining your hands with even more of your siblings blood. You can even return to your life of old, with even more comforts than you\u0027ve had before. It\u0027s either that, or rot in a cell.\"\n\n\nSophia Nevermore\u0027s choices were laid out to her, as heavy and as suffocating as they were. \n",
  "page 76": "For some reason, leaving anytime that isn\u0027t tonight just doesn\u0027t sit right with the princess. It\u0027s now or never for the young woman, and she her body and mind are already in gear for a night exit without raising any alarm of suspicion. \n\n\n\"Juliette, I understand your concern, I certainly do, but isn\u0027t this night just perfect for the both of us to leave now?\" \n\n\nSophia looks for any room of argument, and Juliette does seem like she wants to raise a few points, but the look of adventure on the princess\u0027s face is almost too much for her to want to put out. In her mind, it was best to get these feelings out, than to suppress them in an unhealthy way. \n\n\nJuliette Forthwight would just have to do her best that Sophia didn\u0027t do too much to place herself in harm’s way and find herself getting hurt by the world that was outside the palace walls. \n\n\n\"Fine, I\u0027ll hasten the preparations, and I\u0027ll make sure there\u0027s enough provisions that we do not starve quickly. Oh! And money, yes, money is the thing that we\u0027ll need to get by as well. But how should we go about leaving? Will grabbing horses make too much noise, or should we brave leaving this place by foot?\"\n\n\nJuliette is talking to herself now, and Sophia thinks on which choice to the two of them should be going with to make their getaway.\n",
  "page 79": "The afternoon sun washes the two young lovers in a warm glow. The balcony of the Rose Palace was bigger than most most people\u0027s bedrooms, and was quite sizable to hold a party of people if needed. Needless to say it was quite accommodating in playing host for both Sophia Nevermore and the prince of Aster, Caspar Holt, as they shared and reaffirmed the great love they have felt each other since the first time their eyes met, all of those years ag--\n\n\n\"Why are you here!? I thought I made it quite clear that your face is something I could do without seeing for awhile!\" Sophia exclaimed, crossing the balcony in a circular pace, arms also crossed as she chewed on her thumb. \n\n\nCaspar for his part kept a composed neutral expression. He figured that he had to be understanding of his wife to be plight. \n\n\n\"I must stress that I still am very sorry for what occurred in the dinner party those months ago. What I did was... inconsiderate, unsavory, and if I can take it back, surely I woul--\" \n\n\nSophia raises a hand to stop him from speaking any further, red dusting her cheeks as she recalls the memory herself. \n\n\nIt was months ago, Sophia was gladly enjoying staring out of the window of her room until the crown prince himself decided that she should \u0027enjoy the festivities\u0027 of the party. It wasn’t like it was an important event, such as the founding of the Rose Kingdom itself, but a standard typical ball in which the young woman felt her presence would not be necessary to liven things up. After all, there were so many other of the Nevermore bloodline who enjoyed such things as dressing up and mingling with other important individuals and delegates from foreign nations that she had only read from books. \n\n\nBut no, Caspar took it upon himself to bring her out of her room to enjoy whatever atmosphere there was to enjoy. Of course her dress and hair were impeccable, as it always was even on lazy days. Beauty was a weapon that could be used to protect yourself ands help others. That beauty extended to the physical being and should also be applied to one\u0027s inner self. \n\n\nA lesson taught by her ever busy and traveling older sister: Penelope Nevermore.  \n\n\nNow where was this going? Sophia had danced and danced with many of the hands that were offered to her. After all, she was a rare sight to see on the dance floor. She didn\u0027t blame the men and women that had attended from being unable to withhold their desires to behold her in her full splendor with a close proximity. However, so much dancing had left her quite out of sorts and she ended up spilling her drink on a rather important delegate.\n\n\nWhy would the ever dazzling and near perfect princess that was Sophia Nevermore even spill a drink? It was the result of hearing of her father\u0027s apparent disapproval of her accepting many of the offers given to dance. \n\n\nAfter all, he preferred her to stay in her room, and only allowed to leave outside with a trusted attendant and the best guards that the kingdom could afford to give her on her strolls. Even then, she was only allowed to go out a certain distance and that just so happened to result in her never personally meeting any persons that could be considered of \u0027common\u0027 birth. Of course like any curious young woman she wanted to do so much more, but she was grateful for the things her father had offered her.\n\n\nAnd it was all thanks to Caspar that she behaved in such an improper and embarrassing way. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ve never seen father so angry, and part of his ire was directed at me, because of you, remember?\" \n\n\n\"Actually, I\u0027m sure the king wouldn’t have minded if I were drawn and quartered for what I did.\" \n\n\n\"You\u0027re quite a lucky little prince, Caspar Holt.\" \n\n\n\"Eh, little, huh?\" \n\n\nCaspar trailed off with a small amused laugh, staring intently at the haughty little princess before him. The woman certainly looked please with putting him through a verbal lashing, as she always was. Secretly, though he would admit to nobody but perhaps his closet attendant, he found Sophia\u0027s way of speaking both honest, but certainly quite refreshing. \n\n\nIn the content expression on her face, he could feel and see the comfortable familiarity on her face even with eyes closed. \n\n\nSo just like that, both of the young nobles fell into a comfortable silence. This wasn\u0027t a difficult thing to do when the person you were spending your time with was someone you have been familiar with since childhood. And for one of the individuals, a person you were hopelessly fond of to the point of lov--a familial love--yes, that was what this was.\n\n\nAn arranged marriage between two kings, shaking the other\u0027s hand with drinks and food flowing. Oh to them it was a throwaway thing to do, but to the two whom actually would be husband and wife, prince to king, and a princess to queen, it wasn\u0027t as easy. \n\n\n\"So, it\u0027s at the end of the month,\" Caspar takes a pause, \"How do you feel about that, Sophie?\" \n\n\n\"Again with the \u0027Sophie\u0027 thing, prince Caspar Holt?\" Sophia began, but stopped when she saw the rather serious expression on the boy\u0027s--scratch that, please--the man\u0027s face. He was looking at her in a way that a man would look at a woman he was fond of, and quite frankly, it had her at quite a loss! \n\n\nJust how did Sophia Nevermore feel about this? \n",
  "page 78": "Sophia Nevermore laughed. It was a bitter one, and it was one that lasted for several seconds. \n\n\n\"I,\" The young queen picked up her cup, it was half full, half empty. She poured it out right on the floor, and if she could spew forth all of the contents that she had already drunk, she would. Of course this action earned her a scowl she never seen on the old man\u0027s face, which made him look even older. \n\n\n\"I would rather die several times over than have you have your way with me.\" Sophia faced the man with a glare, standing up from her seat and not sitting down even as weapons were pointed her direction.\n\n\nThe intention wasn\u0027t to kill, but to threaten, and she had faced death that was certain more than whatever this was. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s better to rot, than lay with an already near rotting corpse.\" \n\n\nWith a motion of Reginald\u0027s head, one of knights smashes the side of her cheek with a crushing backhand from a iron covered hand. It\u0027s enough to floor her and make her see stars as if the night was brimming in the room itself. The young queen\u0027s cheek throbs and continues to do so as she gingerly raises a hand to touch her cheek. \n\n\n\"Take them away.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia Nevermore sits in silence, sharing a cell with nobody but her own thoughts. The days come to her like a slow insidious hell. She\u0027s kept well-fed, but far removed from her knights. The hours pass slowly, but even then, she doesn\u0027t regret her choice. Even when the old man visits her to taunt her and ask if she is yet to reconsider, she gives him no response. \n\n\nBy her estimate, a week has passed since she has found herself in a cell. \n\n\nIt wasn\u0027t any place for a Queen, but it feels all the more fitting for her. Was this her divine punishment for the path that she had chosen? Sophia Nevermore doesn’t know, but it\u0027s something that she soon learns to accept. \n\n\n\"Does he really want to break my spirit? If he did, maybe he should start doing a better job of it.\" \n\n\nSophia joked to herself, pacing her cell for what felt like the hundredth time. \n\n\nThere wasn\u0027t much in the amount of ways she could get recreational activity. Maybe she also paced about because it helped soothe her nerves in some way, and keep her from truly becoming mad enough to accept Reginald\u0027s proposal. \n\n\nBoom!\n\n\nIt\u0027s quick and sudden, but the wall of her cell suddenly bursts free. Its entire base is destroyed via the glowing hands of the trainee mages that Roy had personally took to tutoring. \n\n\n\"Sophia!\"\n\n\nThat voice\n\n\nThere\u0027s blonde hair, that\u0027s the only thing she\u0027s able to make out before she is lifted off of her feet and spun around by strong arms. For some reason, the man holding her thought it better to grow his hair out to the point it was quite shaggy and unkempt in its length. He even had the gall to grow even taller than two years ago. \n\n\n\"Caspar?!\" Sophia fights to find her voice to say any further, and she realizes that her eyes are starting to water. It\u0027s from a combination of relief and the genuine surprise of being wrong.\n\n\nIn this instance, she certainly didn\u0027t mind that she was wrong about the condition of the man who stood before her. He places her down, craning his neck so that he could inspect her for any discernible wounds. Perhaps she would have found it annoying before because he was being a worrywart, but now she simply didn\u0027t want him to have to smell her.\n\n\nSophia immediately peels away from, hugging her waist as she turns. \n\n\n\"Your highness! I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re okay! The knights told me that brute had been keeping you in a cell all for yourself! You must have suffered so much in your isolation! But look at this, Prince Caspar is alive!\"\n\n\nSophia smirked, turning to face the full part that stood before her. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s King Caspar now, is it not?\" She remarks. \n\n\n\"And I hear you\u0027ve been going as Queen,\" Caspar replies as he wags his eyebrows. \"How things have changed. You\u0027ve been through plenty, from what I hear.\" \n\n\nSophia waves it off. \n\n\n\"And you? Your grandfather said that you were dead.\" \n\n\nCaspar\u0027s face darkens. \"Almost. My father certainly is. My grandfather had his men chasing me and what few of the loyal knights I had. Facing the full might of the Holt Kingdom, while trying to stay low-key was certainly an arduous task. Still, I should have rushed to your side when I\u0027ve heard all that you were going through.\" \n\n\n\"Not at all,\" Sophia replies, smiling at the man. \n\n\nShe tries to find the words that doesn’t bring her embarrassment while everyone’s eyes glued on their conversation. \n\n\n\"Maybe the part of me that\u0027s still a little girl, she would have liked you to swoop in and save her, but the woman that stands before you would feel rather inadequate. I\u0027ve did some things that I\u0027m not proud of, things that I\u0027m certainly glad that you didn’t have to play spectator to.\" \n\n\nCaspar nods his head in understanding. \n\n\n\"Well then, what\u0027s the plan, your majesty?\"\n\n\nSophia points past Caspar, past the doorway leading up to freedom from the cells herself and her men had found themselves in. Looking to freedom would have been just fine, but her eyes are now set towards whom she feels are the real enemies. \n\n\n\"We put an end to the last people that carry the same name, birthright, and the same blood in their very veins. I don\u0027t want to have to kill them, but this entire conflict, it will be hard to stay my hand when the time comes.\" Sophia voiced her honest thoughts out into the open, feeling that if she didn\u0027t, the weight of her actions wouldn\u0027t be something that she could bear.\n\n\nHowever, she was growing tired of feeling that way. \n\n\nIf there was a weight that she to bear, she would bear it. The crown could only rest on one of their heads at the end of the day. The mockery of nobility would end with either her death or her brother’s and sister\u0027s. \n\n\n\"You finally sound confident.\" Evie remarked.\n\n\n\"Any enemies of yours, they are of course mine.\" Paul stated as he tightened his artificial hand into a confident fist. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m not going to say an embarrassing line.\" Roy deadpanned, folding his arms. There was an unmistakable feeling of jealousy that he was feeling towards the sight he had just witnessed after all. \n\n\nOf course she would have some guy she has a pre-established history with. \n\n\nJuliette beams proudly at Sophia. There\u0027s plenty more she would like to tell the woman, but with the interest of immediately changing the backdrop that they were now in, she only says this: \n\n\n\"We\u0027re with you until the end, your majesty.\" \n\n\nThat\u0027s all Sophia Nevermore needs to hear to steel her heart even further, so that it doesn’t form any more cracks. \n\n\n\"In a year\u0027s time, we march to the central capital of the Rose Kingdom.\" The statement earns many a surprised murmur, but the queen moves to quickly bring reason to her words. \"That will gives us plenty of time to amass our forces in greater number. Until then, we\u0027ll forge letters, and speak as if we\u0027re Reginald, and like he still actually has things under his control.\" \n\n\nSophia stares up at the ceiling. \n\n\n\"Mark the day down.\" \n",
  "page 71": "It\u0027s a feeling of great hate towards her own self that Sophia finds herself seriously contemplating this old man\u0027s offer. Perhaps they were one in the same in ways. Nothing he said was too far off from the truth, and Sophia Nevermore was beginning to find herself tired of this path. There were still more siblings she would have to confront if she wanted a grasp on what really happened those two years ago. Did she even have enough strength to hear what the truth was? If it\u0027s something that her father was worth being killed over, did he in fact do something that warranted, from his own children at that? \n\n\nShe feels like she wants to become sick all over the table sheet. \n\n\nThere\u0027s a great period of silence that passes over the table. But the fight seems to leave the young woman\u0027s body as she practically deflates in her chair. Sensing this, and ever the experienced king that he was, Reginald directs his men to take the knights that had accompanied Sophia out of the room to their many protest. The \u0027queen\u0027 just sits in her seat, and doesn’t say a word to stop such a thing from occurring. Fighting, she was tired of having to fight any longer. Her eyes feel heavy and dead as she stares at the wall, hoping to trade places with it. \n\n\nThe feeling increases ten-fold as she feels the hand over her own. \n\n\n\"It doesn\u0027t have to be tonight, but eventually, you should become receptive to the idea.\" \n",
  "page 70": "A Traveling Queen\n\n\nSophia Nevermore looked at her options that were on the table, and she figured that she wanted nothing more to do with the responsibilities that piling up for her to take care of. Even more so when one of those responsibilities involved her having to possibly engage in outright conflict with even more of her family. \n\n\nAs long as they didn\u0027t bother her at this point, she really didn\u0027t even care to try. Sophia would just forgive them if they had something to truly do with her father\u0027s death, that\u0027s what she tries to tell herself. But as long as she doesn\u0027t pursue the path in which those questions receive definite answers, then she was fine with dropping everything and leaving it to someone who had a more of a mind for wanting to run a kingdom. \n\n\nNoel and Penelope were doing a fine enough job of leaving her alone for the most part, and thus she was able to pack up all of her belongings with a clear conscience.\n\n\n\"Your highness, are you making a trip?\" \n\n\nJuliette asks upon spotting the queen. \n\n\n\"Something of that sort. I\u0027m leaving, but I\u0027ll leave a note so that Paul can be in charge.\" \n\n\n\"Is there any reason why you\u0027re leaving, your highness?\" \n\n\nSophia seriously contemplates this again when Juliette questions her reasoning. Well she didn\u0027t find joy in killing, and she also didn’t find much joy in being trying to kill her. If she could lead a life in which both of those things could be avoided, she would gladly lead that one than the one that she was currently in. \n\n\n\"Yes. I think we should find somewhere and settle down. Somewhere far away.\"\n\n\nJuliette is shocked, but she doesn\u0027t look at all put off or unhappy with the words the princess was telling her. In her mind, the princess had more than earned the right to live as she pleased. From the moment she was born, Juliette would say that the woman that stood across from her deserved that life. And wherever that life was, Juliette would follow until the other woman told her otherwise, or death unfortunately separated her away from the princess.\n\n\n\"If it\u0027s as you wish, then please, allow me to accompany you on this journey.\" \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIt\u0027s never made clear what happens between the two women after they leave.\n\n\nSome sightings say they spot two women at a theater, one of them looks like the princess Sophia Nevermore herself walked out of a  portrait and donned the clothes of a normal woman her age.\n\n\nOther sightings detail two women, enjoying a nice picnic, and one of them looks like the princess Sophia Nevermore.\n\n\nOr in a desert somewhere, in the middle of a great pilgrimage. Or on a boat crossing the sea, feeing the hungry, and so forth. \n\n\nIt is said that whenever these two women are spotted, they couldn’t look any more happier and refreshed from life if they tried. If anything, they look like two women free of a great weight and responsibility.\n\n\n \n\nFin.\n",
  "page 73": "-Year 21-\n\n\nUnlike previous battles, Sophia Nevermore would be playing the role of aggressor. There was fair warning given to her brother and sister that her army would be taking to the streets, and to evacuate any citizens. She was glad that its seemed that both of them had adhered to her request. They were being so accommodating before the clashing of swords, the spilling of blood, and the loss of life would begin. \n\n\nA year was plenty of time for the combined forces of her army and the Holt\u0027s to meet the army that adorned the banner of Noel and Penelope Nevermore. \n\n\nThe numbers were just too much for the latter\u0027s army forces to deal with. \n\n\nThe battle was overwhelmingly in Sophia Nevermore\u0027s favor, and she walked the streets with all of the grace a queen should be able to muster. There was no arrogance in her step, but only a purposeful and dignified approach. Unlike her other siblings, there was no more ill will in her heart. There was some, but it mostly dulled out. The young queen figured she shouldn’t let her rage control her actions on this momentous day. \n\n\n\"My questions, you both will answer every single one.\"\n\n\nSophia walked up the long stairs that led to the throne room, eyes focused dead ahead. Her knights kept close-by, but ultimately allowed her much space to walk as she pleased, without her shoulders possibly brushing against one of theirs.  \n\n\nIt wasn\u0027t long before she stood before long towering doors, and without haste pushed them open. It was time to get this over with she felt. A year was enough time to get rid of any lingering doubts on whether or not she was ready to face the truth. She was an adult woman, having grown in stature, and even mentally. \n\n\nPhysically, so much was debatable. \n\n\n\"Ah, so you finally showed up.\"\n\n\nIt wasn\u0027t her brother or sister that sat in thrones, or stood up to greet her, but a lone standing Zeska Orlov. Three years ago she was known as the captain of the royal guards for her father. It wasn\u0027t a position only given away to her, but one that she had to work countless hours for in becoming the strongest solider in his service. \n\n\nZeska takes a prolonged exhale, before facing the queen with a ferocious glare. \"I should have killed you when I had the chance, but you and that attendant of yours just so happened to leave the night before. It was only because of Penelope\u0027s wishes that I didn\u0027t personally come and see you as you\u0027ve made so much noise throughout these short years.\" She sees the lack of soldiers and shakes her head. \"You shouldn’t have come alone, Sophia Nevermore!\" \n\n\nSophia smiles a forlorn smile. This was something that the queen hadn’t accounted for. \n\n\n\"Is everything you do for Penelope?\" \n\n\n\"Of course it is.\" \n\n\n\"Do you think she\u0027ll let you sleep at the edge of her bed if you remain loyal?\" \n\n\n\"What makes me different than your attendant that you\u0027ve allowed to do the same.\" \n\n\n\"Not much, you can say.\" Sophia found herself laughing despite herself. Cutting it short to stare directly into the eyes of Zeska Orlov. \"I would say that the difference is I simply like her more than you.\" \n\n\nThis time, it is Zeska that laughs, before she takes a battle stance.\n\n\n\"Well then, if you kill me, everything will be answered for you, but if you die, that becomes the least of your problems, doesn’t it?\" Zeska says in a matter of fact tone, before she slowly begins her advance. \n\n\n\"Ready whenever you are, your highness!\" \n\n\nZeska would then charge, bringing her blade down swinging. \n",

The mockery of nobility would end with either her death or her brother’s and sister\u0027s. \n\n\n\"You finally sound confident.\" Evie remarked.\n\n\n\"Any enemies of yours, they are of course mine.\" Paul stated as he tightened his artificial hand into a confident fist. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m not going to say an embarrassing line.\" Roy deadpanned, folding his arms. There was an unmistakable feeling of jealousy that he was feeling towards the sight he had just witnessed after all. \n\n\nOf course she would have some guy she has a pre-established history with. \n\n\nJuliette beams proudly at Sophia. There\u0027s plenty more she would like to tell the woman, but with the interest of immediately changing the backdrop that they were now in, she only says this: \n\n\n\"We\u0027re with you until the end, your majesty.\" \n\n\nThat\u0027s all Sophia Nevermore needs to hear to steel her heart even further, so that it doesn’t form any more cracks. \n\n\n\"In a year\u0027s time, we march to the central capital of the Rose Kingdom.\" The statement earns many a surprised murmur, but the queen moves to quickly bring reason to her words. \"That will gives us plenty of time to amass our forces in greater number. Until then, we\u0027ll forge letters, and speak as if we\u0027re Reginald, and like he still actually has things under his control.\" \n\n\nSophia stares up at the ceiling. \n\n\n\"Mark the day down.\" \n",
  "page 74": "Sophia Nevermore laughed. It was a bitter one, and it was one that lasted for several seconds. \n\n\n\"I,\" The young queen picked up her cup, it was half full, half empty. She poured it out right on the floor, and if she could spew forth all of the contents that she had already drunk, she would. Of course this action earned her a scowl she never seen on the old man\u0027s face, which made him look even older. \n\n\n\"I would rather die several times over than have you have your way with me.\" Sophia faced the man with a glare, standing up from her seat and not sitting down even as weapons were pointed her direction.\n\n\nThe intention wasn\u0027t to kill, but to threaten, and she had faced death that was certain more than whatever this was. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s better to rot, than lay with an already near rotting corpse.\" \n\n\nWith a motion of Reginald\u0027s head, one of knights smashes the side of her cheek with a crushing backhand from a iron covered hand. It\u0027s enough to floor her and make her see stars as if the night was brimming in the room itself. The young queen\u0027s cheek throbs and continues to do so as she gingerly raises a hand to touch her cheek. \n\n\n\"Take them away.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia Nevermore sits in silence, sharing a cell with nobody but her own thoughts. The days come to her like a slow insidious hell. She\u0027s kept well-fed, but far removed from her knights. The hours pass slowly, but even then, she doesn\u0027t regret her choice. Even when the old man visits her to taunt her and ask if she is yet to reconsider, she gives him no response. \n\n\nBy her estimate, a week has passed since she has found herself in a cell. \n\n\nIt wasn\u0027t any place for a Queen, but it feels all the more fitting for her. Was this her divine punishment for the path that she had chosen? Sophia Nevermore doesn’t know, but it\u0027s something that she soon learns to accept. \n\n\n\"Does he really want to break my spirit? If he did, maybe he should start doing a better job of it.\" \n\n\nSophia joked to herself, pacing her cell for what felt like the hundredth time. \n\n\nThere wasn\u0027t much in the amount of ways she could get recreational activity. Maybe she also paced about because it helped soothe her nerves in some way, and keep her from truly becoming mad enough to accept Reginald\u0027s proposal. \n\n\nBoom!\n\n\nIt\u0027s quick and sudden, but the wall of her cell suddenly bursts free. Its entire base is destroyed via the glowing hands of the trainee mages that Roy had personally took to tutoring. \n\n\n\"Sophia!\"\n\n\nThat voice\n\n\nThere\u0027s blonde hair, that\u0027s the only thing she\u0027s able to make out before she is lifted off of her feet and spun around by strong arms. For some reason, the man holding her thought it better to grow his hair out to the point it was quite shaggy and unkempt in its length. He even had the gall to grow even taller than two years ago. \n\n\n\"Caspar?!\" Sophia fights to find her voice to say any further, and she realizes that her eyes are starting to water. It\u0027s from a combination of relief and the genuine surprise of being wrong.\n\n\nIn this instance, she certainly didn\u0027t mind that she was wrong about the condition of the man who stood before her. He places her down, craning his neck so that he could inspect her for any discernible wounds. Perhaps she would have found it annoying before because he was being a worrywart, but now she simply didn\u0027t want him to have to smell her.\n\n\nSophia immediately peels away from, hugging her waist as she turns. \n\n\n\"Your highness! I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re okay! The knights told me that brute had been keeping you in a cell all for yourself! You must have suffered so much in your isolation! But look at this, Prince Caspar is alive!\"\n\n\nSophia smirked, turning to face the full part that stood before her. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s King Caspar now, is it not?\" She remarks. \n\n\n\"And I hear you\u0027ve been going as Queen,\" Caspar replies as he wags his eyebrows. \"How things have changed. You\u0027ve been through plenty, from what I hear.\" \n\n\nSophia waves it off. \n\n\n\"And you? Your grandfather said that you were dead.\" \n\n\nCaspar\u0027s face darkens. \"Almost. My father certainly is. My grandfather had his men chasing me and what few of the loyal knights I had. Facing the full might of the Holt Kingdom, while trying to stay low-key was certainly an arduous task. Still, I should have rushed to your side when I\u0027ve heard all that you were going through.\" \n\n\n\"Not at all,\" Sophia replies, smiling at the man. \n\n\nShe tries to find the words that doesn’t bring her embarrassment while everyone’s eyes glued on their conversation. \n\n\n\"Maybe the part of me that\u0027s still a little girl, she would have liked you to swoop in and save her, but the woman that stands before you would feel rather inadequate. I\u0027ve did some things that I\u0027m not proud of, things that I\u0027m certainly glad that you didn’t have to play spectator to.\" \n\n\nCaspar nods his head in understanding. \n\n\n\"Well then, what\u0027s the plan, your majesty?\"\n\n\nSophia points past Caspar, past the doorway leading up to freedom from the cells herself and her men had found themselves in. Looking to freedom would have been just fine, but her eyes are now set towards whom she feels are the real enemies. \n\n\n\"We put an end to the last people that carry the same name, birthright, and the same blood in their very veins. I don\u0027t want to have to kill them, but this entire conflict, it will be hard to stay my hand when the time comes.\" Sophia voiced her honest thoughts out into the open, feeling that if she didn\u0027t, the weight of her actions wouldn\u0027t be something that she could bear.\n\n\nHowever, she was growing tired of feeling that way. \n\n\nIf there was a weight that she to bear, she would bear it. The crown could only rest on one of their heads at the end of the day. The mockery of nobility would end with either her death or her brother’s and sister\u0027s. \n\n\n\"You finally sound confident.\" Evie remarked.\n\n\n\"Any enemies of yours, they are of course mine.\" Paul stated as he tightened his artificial hand into a confident fist. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m not going to say an embarrassing line.\" Roy deadpanned, folding his arms.

  "page 130": "~Year 23~\n\n\nQueen in name alone\n\n\n\"It\u0027s the Queen! Make way! Make way!\" \n\n\nSophia finds it hard to walk and move out of the carriage. \n\n\nHer stomach had gotten so much bigger. Could her small frame even handle such a thing for a third time? She wonders this to herself as she\u0027s supported by knights with the Holt insignia. Although she very much had her own kingdom to run, whenever the king of the Holts called upon her presence, she nearly had to drop everything and come running. \n\n\nShe honestly didn\u0027t feel like had much in terms of power at times. She was a queen of the Nevermore family, right? \n\n\nSophia is led throughout the halls and she sees several portraits of dignified men. Her body lingers on a picture of a certain boy with blonde hair, and eyes that were blue, but a different shade from hers. Oh, she noticed that the color of his hair was also a different shade than hers as well. \n\n\nHonestly, she would feel slightly odd looking at someone romantically whose features were so very similar to her own. That\u0027s why, this arrangement wasn\u0027t bad.\n\n\nAlthough she didn\u0027t see much of her friends like she used to, this arrangement wasn\u0027t bad. Sophia never had to lift another hand and take another life ever again.\n\n\nThat was really all she wanted. \n\n\nAny indignity she would have to face, it was well worth it.\n\n\n\"Ah!\" She suddenly feels a kick to her stomach, and it catches her off guard. Fortunately, the father is quick to catch her. Even in his rather mature age, he was still quite spunky. The life she lived, it was one that she was content with living. Sophia Nevermore didn’t have to think anymore if she ever wanted to. \n\n\nHe smiles at her, and she smiles at him.\n\n\nThe woman\u0027s thoughts are happy ones, like an impending date of a wedding. It would be on that day where everything will truly feel complete for her. \n\n\nIt would be the day she could choose to cast away the Nevermore name. \n\n\n \n\nFin. \n",
  "page 132": "Sophia shakes her head, breaking away from Caspar so that she could move and slightly hunch over to speak with her little sister. Their difference in height wasn\u0027t so great, but still, she wanted to be the mature one when she was already feeling quite terrible for having to decline an invitation from Bridgette to begin with. \n\n\n\"Maybe next time, Bridgette. I\u0027m just enjoying the fresh air so much.\" \n\n\nBridgette nods her head in understanding, spinning around on her heels.\n\n\n\"Are you sure it isn\u0027t another reason? One that\u0027s standing behind you right now, sister?\" \n\n\nWith that said, Bridgette walks away, leaving a stammering Sophia behind. Caspar however chuckles softly at her embarrassment, just happy that he would be able to spend more time with the woman. \n\n\n\"And why are you laughing?\"\n\n\nCaspar stops immediately, holding his hands up to show that he was an innocent party. \n\n\n\"Was I laughing?\"\n\n\nSophia nods her head, crossing her arms at him as she waited for him to stop doing so.\n\n\n\"Honestly, my embarrassment isn\u0027t funny.\" \n\n\nCaspar smiled, leaning back on the balcony.\n\n\n\"Why are you embarrassed to begin with?\" \n\n\nSophia growled, feeling her face grow hot. Now she was sure she was blushing. This was what a dangerous prince reduced her to. It makes her wonder just why she decided to even stay with him on the balcony.\n\n\n\"Because you embarrass me, Caspar!\" Sophia stressed.\n\n\n\"Ow.\" Caspar could only pout, hoping to earn himself some sympathy. \n\n\nSophia soon sighs, joining him up on the balcony. It\u0027s a rather dangerous seat, with one small mistake and the both of them could end up falling down into the shrubbery below. \n\n\n\"You won\u0027t make me say sorry, you know.\" \n",
  "page 112": "Zeska would be perhaps the toughest foe that the weapon had faced. This wasn\u0027t a battle under the duress of the conditions of a chaotic war, but a duel between two on opposing sides of the other. At a time, Sophia may have feared for her life and thought this a foe impossible to topple, but more than one thousand days had passed, and she was no longer that person. However, this still didn\u0027t change the fact that the woman whom carried a behemoth of a weapon around like it weighed little more than paper, would outclass her if she tried any means that required the physical aspect of a fight.\n\n\nSo when the weapon is swung, Sophia only raises her hand, conjuring a dark haze of smoke that would bubble around the woman\u0027s head, causing her weapon to hit the ground, only grazing her slightly to cause a small tear in her rather expensive in material robes. Unlike most, Zeska would have grown a resistance to such magic, but Sophia carried with her a concealed knife which she stabs though the woman\u0027s throat. There was no time to dabble in the pleasantries of such a thing as mercy and giving one a dignified death. \n\n\nShe drives the small blade in repeatedly, watching as the woman gurgled on her own blood, but still had enough strength to lift her off the ground with a punch that went underneath her chin. The force of her head meeting the ground is enough to leave her momentarily dazed and unable to defend against the heavy boot that slams into her stomach.\n\n\n\"Urh... Peno..lope.. I promis... k-kill you.\" \n\n\nSophia thinks the woman to truly be a monster as she continues on despite her fatal wounds. Struggling to lift her sword with one hand as she clutched her profusely bleeding wound with the other. For a moment the queen thinks herself to be a dead woman when pressed into the ground like this, feeling absolutely hopeless and defenseless against such a foe. It could be argued that little changed, and although she had finally brought to the monster of a solider great injuries, this was still her defea--\n\n\n\"N-now or never, Juliette.\"\n\n\nWith those words, a well-timed arrow would meet its mark. The arrow itself burrowing through the head of the hard to kill Zeska, going through both ends of either side of her head and felling her. The woman still continued to twitch even as she bled profusely, but she finally does expire once Juliette mercilessly pulls her arrow out of the woman\u0027s with a fluid motion. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she voices to the woman, before her attention is back to Sophia, whom she offers a hand that the woman takes to pull herself off of the floor. \n\n\nIt\u0027s at that moment that another door opens from the room, and there stands Noel and Penelope Nevermore. They both hold the other\u0027s hand, and each take a moment to stare at Zeska\u0027s body sadly. There\u0027s regret in their faces as they continue their steps to meet their younger sister. There\u0027s no hint of anger, or a negative emotion to be seen on their either one of their faces. In fact, they look more regretful than anything, but there\u0027s a hint to their eyes that shows a belief that despite it all, it was worth it. \n\n\n\"There\u0027s plenty we have to explain to you, huh?\" Noel asks with a tired laugh.\n\n\n\"Such an understatement, Noel.\" Penelope playfully knocks into his shoulder with hers.\n\n\nThe young women only watch all the while. \n\n\n\"Please do.\" Both Sophia and Juliette say in unison.\n",
  "page 114": "The room is silent, and nobody opens their mouths to speak. That is because both Noel and Penelope have the floor to speak, and Sophia and Juliette are ever respectful towards that fact. \n\n\n\"First of all, have you been alright, Sophia?\" Penelope asks her sister, reaching out with a free hand to squeeze the one of her sister\u0027s. Her eyes grow wet with tears, but she\u0027s quick to shake them off. \"I almost feel unworthy as a big sister to even ask you that question. It\u0027s through the results of our actions that you\u0027ve had to do so much that you should have never had to do.\"\n\n\nSophia feels awkward until the weight of her sister\u0027s words. She remembers her always being so steadfast and confident, with a face that never displayed any emotions of weakness. \n\n\nHowever, maybe that Sophia herself placing unrealistic expectations on her. \n\n\n\"It truly is just us now that remains of the main family. Our blood might be in all corners of the kingdom, but only here in this very room does it swim so deeply in our veins.\" Noel speaks, placing a hand on Sophia\u0027s shoulder in very much a way that an older brother would to comfort their younger sibling. \n\n\nAll of this felt surreal to Sophia, especially considering her most recent interactions with her siblings.\n\n\n\"What you two will say... your explanations will make it all make sense, right? There\u0027s a reason for all of this bloodshed, it must be. Our father died because he absolutely did something that warranted such a thing, correct!?\" Sophia is desperate that the next words she hears from the two of them doesn’t make her disappointed and bitter.\n\n\nPenelope looks to struggle to say the next words that are at the very tip of her tongue. \n\n\n\"You can do it, Mary.\" It\u0027s Noel that gives her an encouraging squeeze of the hand. He gives her an affectionate look, and with his eyes silently tells her that he will be a source of strength that she could draw from. \n\n\nPenelope finally faces her sister\u0027s eyes. \n\n\n\"You look so much like mother now. I did onc-- no, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s still many of her traits I carry with me.\" Penelope trembles, but gets it under control before it becomes too noticeable. \"When I was your age, father would tell me as much, whenever he drunk too much and found his way in my bed. At first, I thought it was something that I could endure, and even grow to enjoy. I was telling myself I was father\u0027s favorite, but then he began looking at you the same way he once did me.\" \n\n\nSophia feels uneasy, her heart drums in her ears loudly. This couldn’t be true about the man who had given her everything she had ever wanted, treated her as best a father could for their daughter. The image she had created of him, the cracks were forming in her mind, and she places a hand over her breast to keep herself calm.\n\n\n\"Mother was a prodigy when it came to harnessing natural magic. Simply breathing in the earth, the air, it made a powerful foundation for her to draw from. Father however began to fear how powerful she had become, and that hurt mother deeply. So with her final spell, she made it so that the rose petals never stopped falling in the Rose Kingdom. It was so our father could never forget her, even if he found another woman. Such a spell of permanently manipulating the world itself, it takes great sacrifices.\"\n\n\nNoel steps forward. \n\n\n\"A limb, parts of your mind, memories, your life is sometimes not enough. Sometimes the Gods need more if you want to perform the same feats as them. The sacrifices, it can turn the man you might have shared a bed with in the past, mad, or some of your children might end up with less magical aptitude than yourself, or none at all. It becomes a curse.\"\n\n\nPenelope\u0027s eyes glew a brilliant shade of blue.\n\n\n\"Sophia, it seems there\u0027s no curse on placed on you on that front. It\u0027s no wonder that Bridgette and Henry were overwhelmed by you despite having magic on the level that surpassed mages that have been studying magic for a decade or more. You probably had no idea, huh?\" \n\n\nThe queen exhales a long sigh she\u0027s been holding as her siblings spoke. \n\n\n\"So you both killed father because... of the heinous things he did to Penelope? I-I didn’t know that all this time you were suffering from having your pride repeatedly stepped on and disgraced.\" \n\n\nPenelope shook her head. \n\n\n\"Not at all. I used to think i was keeping his attention away from you if I did everything to make him happy. I thought I was the perfect older sister, protecting her young half. B-but that wasn\u0027t the case whatsoever! A part of me was angry, I was angry that he was throwing me away, discarding me like a used toy. But when brother confessed to me his feelings, how he had grown jealous of father taking me away from him... I knew I had my chance.\" \n\n\nThe two siblings embrace very much like lovers. Sophia and Juliette are unable to hide their appalled faces. \n\n\n\"It was a simple matter of getting into contact with Reginald. He wanted his crown and we wanted ours. The world would never accept our relationship, of me taking my sister to be my queen. We thought if we sacrificed all of you... they would have no choice, as we would have the most power out of every kingdom.\"\n\n\nNoel raises his hand, as if he\u0027s seeing a reality that could have been. \n\n\n\"But we\u0027ve realized,\" Penelope speaks for him in his stead. \"This world would never accept us. We would have to hide the truth from everyone until the day we die, and that\u0027s no good.\"\n\n\nThe two take several steps away from the two women. They stop at the large window in the room, it\u0027s already wide open as they both take a stand on the edge of said window. \n\n\n\"Any of our dreams became impossible when you marched upon the capital with such an outstanding number of soldiers. Zeska was the very last obstacle in your way. Noel speaks, looking back at his sister with a smile as Penelope does the same. \"We\u0027re very proud of the person you have become, but our fate is only justice. Every life that has been lost throughout the years, you can blame it on us.\" \n\n\nSophia runs forward, holding her hand out to stop them.\n\n\n\"Wai--\"\n\n\nNoel and Penolope only shake their heads.\n\n\n\"Goodbye, Sophia.\" \n\n\nWith those words they willingly plummeted several feet below. There\u0027s no way the woman has any power in her legs that could make her possibly fast enough to stop them from hitting the ground below. She can only grimace at the sound that their bodies make, and she quickly averts her gaze from having to see the results of their action. \n\n\n\"Your majesty, please get away from the window!\" \n\n\nEver the protective woman that she was, Juliette grabs Sophia and pulls her away from the scene. \n\n\n\"I-I\u0027ll be fine. I just have to get my thoughts in order, Juliette.\" \n\n\nOh there was quite plenty she would have to get in order when it came to her mind. For now, Sophia Nevermore would have to pick up all of the fragmented pieces left by her siblings and put things back whole. A break was something that she wanted, to go back in her room and sleep for hours on end, but that was a luxury. \n\n\nFor now, she had to let her kingdom know that the victory was hers.\n\n\nNo matter how bitter and disgusting victory tasted. \n",
  "page 113": "Sophia tries to move her body to avoid the strike, and she does, barely. The wound on her arm however causes her to grit her teeth and hold onto her arm. The pain throbs, but she creates distance by shoving her arm right in-front of her body to smash into the chest of the woman. Zeska isn\u0027t affected, however she is forced back and looks down briefly surprised.\n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll be. Looks like you\u0027re planning something dangerous, I\u0027ll have to end it soon.\"\n\n\nSophia bit her lip to stop her breaths from coming out heavy. She doesn\u0027t want to reveal the extent of her pain, but her dominant arm which is the one she casts magic from. \n\n\n\"Likewise. Let\u0027s go, then.\"\n\n\n--x\n\n\nAlthough there isn\u0027t much in the way of fear that the woman feels\n\n\nThe Queen still bleeds, and still will die if a mistake is made.\n\n\nZeska charges again, Sophia doesn\u0027t back down as she moves to raise her arm.\n\n\nA surge of energy swirls thorghout the limb, but she\u0027s far too slow in getting feeling. \n\n\nA blade is pierced through her heart, and she\u0027s driven down into the ground. \n\n\nThe last thing she does is a defiant act, still raisng her hand to try and fire a blast of her energy.\n\n\nShe is however stopped by the last thing she sees, in the form of her sword driving down to remove her head from her body.\n\n\nAll it takes is one mistake to put an end to a tale.\n\n\nHowever, if this is an outcome found unagreeable, or even agreeable, then there\u0027s always a choice to either not make, or make.

  "page 116": "Months later...\n\n\n\"And the rabbit promised to return all of the carrots he had stole. Bygones had became bygones, and all of the little animals in the wild made a pact that they will always be truthful with one another. Theeee end!\" \n\n\nSophia shut her book closed as the children around her clapped. She was unsure of whether or not she would be the perfect person to read to a group of children, but apparently her reading voice wasn\u0027t half bad. She did feel her face go red from slight embarrassment as she did some of the more \u0027excited\u0027 character voices. \n\n\n\"Let\u0027s hear it some more for the Queen! She took time out of her no doubt busy schedule in keeping us all safe to read to you all today.\" The teacher exclaimed. Sophia could only wave him off slightly with an embarrassed smile.\n\n\n\"No, no, it\u0027s always an honor to come down and speak with the future of our kingdom.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n\"How have things been for you Juliette?\" \n\n\nSophia asked from her seat. They were currently seated on the balcony of the Rose Palace. It was for the woman\u0027s benefit that she sent her away on an important mission to help foster healthy relationships and connect them to the Rose Kingdom. The world was a much bigger place than outside the palace after all. However, and unfortunately, Juliette thought it to be some kind of punishment and cruelty being done to her.\n\n\n\"I was constantly worried about whether or not things were well here, your majesty.\" \n\n\nSophia frowned. \n\n\n\"You can call me by my name in private, Juliette.\" \n\n\nJuliette frowned. \n\n\n\"I could never do that.\" \n\n\nSophia wondered if this was a battle that she would ever win. It certainly didn’t seem like she was making any noticeable headway. There was more of a noticeable change made with improving the relationships between nobility and the average citizen by better redistributing the wealth. There was still so much work to be done, and there was never a shortage of improvements that the Rose Kingdom could accept for the betterment of every single person that lived and had a life, friends, family, or a loved one, or loved ones in the very kingdom that she was born in. \n\n\nShe could only hope that she was up to the task to continue and see these changes through.\n\n\nBut which better person could be right for the job other than Sophia Nevermore? Her beauty has only sharpened to become a weapon that many her enemy found themselves blinded by. Magic? It was in abundance for her, and her kingdom? Her friends? They would all be protected as long as she lived.\n\n\n\"Your mother would be so proud, Sophia.\"\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm?\"\n\n\n\"Did you just say my name, Juliette?\" \n\n\nJuliette for her part only smiles, humming loudly as she poured more tea into both of their cups which had been emptied during the duration of the conversation they been having.\n\n\n\"Should we have more tea, your majesty?\" \n\n\nSophia placed her hands over her face, sighing. \n\n\n\"I see what we must do for me to grab the truth here...\" \n\n\nJuliette was interested as she raised a brow.\n\n\n\"A game that I most assuredly can win.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s a terrible sale for your game, your majesty.\"\n\n\nSophia laughed, bringing out a board game and setting it on the table.

  "page 118": "Months later...\n\n\n\"And the rabbit promised to return all of the carrots he had stole. Bygones had became bygones, and all of the little animals in the wild made a pact that they will always be truthful with one another. Theeee end!\" \n\n\nSophia shut her book closed as the children around her clapped. She was unsure of whether or not she would be the perfect person to read to a group of children, but apparently her reading voice wasn\u0027t half bad. She did feel her face go red from slight embarrassment as she did some of the more \u0027excited\u0027 character voices. \n\n\n\"Let\u0027s hear it some more for the Queen! She took time out of her no doubt busy schedule in keeping us all safe to read to you all today.\" The teacher exclaimed. Sophia could only wave him off slightly with an embarrassed smile.\n\n\n\"No, no, it\u0027s always an honor to come down and speak with the future of our kingdom.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n\"How have things been for you Juliette?\" \n\n\nSophia asked from her seat. They were currently seated on the balcony of the Rose Palace. It was for the woman\u0027s benefit that she sent her away on an important mission to help foster healthy relationships and connect them to the Rose Kingdom. The world was a much bigger place than outside the palace after all. However, and unfortunately, Juliette thought it to be some kind of punishment and cruelty being done to her.\n\n\n\"I was constantly worried about whether or not things were well here, your majesty.\" \n\n\nSophia frowned. \n\n\n\"You can call me by my name in private, Juliette.\" \n\n\nJuliette frowned. \n\n\n\"I could never do that.\" \n\n\nSophia wondered if this was a battle that she would ever win. It certainly didn’t seem like she was making any noticeable headway. There was more of a noticeable change made with improving the relationships between nobility and the average citizen by better redistributing the wealth. There was still so much work to be done, and there was never a shortage of improvements that the Rose Kingdom could accept for the betterment of every single person that lived and had a life, friends, family, or a loved one, or loved ones in the very kingdom that she was born in. \n\n\nShe could only hope that she was up to the task to continue and see these changes through.\n\n\nBut which better person could be right for the job other than Sophia Nevermore? Her beauty has only sharpened to become a weapon that many her enemy found themselves blinded by. Magic? It was in abundance for her, and her kingdom? Her friends? They would all be protected as long as she lived.\n\n\n\"Your mother would be so proud, Sophia.\"\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm?\"\n\n\n\"Did you just say my name, Juliette?\" \n\n\nJuliette for her part only smiles, humming loudly as she poured more tea into both of their cups which had been emptied during the duration of the conversation they been having.\n\n\n\"Should we have more tea, your majesty?\" \n\n\nSophia placed her hands over her face, sighing. \n\n\n\"I see what we must do for me to grab the truth here...\" \n\n\nJuliette was interested as she raised a brow.\n\n\n\"A game that I most assuredly can win.\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s a terrible sale for your game, your majesty.\"\n\n\nSophia laughed, bringing out a board game and setting it on the table. It was a strategy game in which victory is only claimed if the person is able to get all of their pieces \u0027home\u0027 before their opponent. It was a game in which both her and Juliette had an equal amount of victories and defeats over the other.\n\n\n\"There are few things i can beat you in, I admit.

Looking at the large outstretched pond that passed along her path to the gazebo, the young woman wondered on whether or not something would feel amiss in her life without ever being able to see a view like this. \n\n\nHer choice was something that was already made, and despite some reservations, she wouldn’t take it back. \n\n\n\"Well, the time for regrets aren’t appropriate now.\" She mumbled to herself, stopping as she heard footsteps behind her heels, and a familiar presence join her side. \n\n\nOf course it was none other than her ever faithful attendant, Juliette. \n\n\n\"Your highness, Sophia,\" she addressed softly, falling in step with the woman. \"If we\u0027re to leave, it would have to be tomorrow night.\" Juliette tells her. \n\n\nConfusion instantly settled in on Sophia. Why would it have to be tomorrow night? Was there some new information that was gathered by her attendant on another being a more ideal one of finally escaping from her cushy prison of life. It didn\u0027t take long for that confusion to turn into some agitation at that feeling of confusion. \n\n\n\"Why do you say tomorrow?\" \n\n\n\"Your father is to ride out tomorrow with Prince Holt back to his kingdom for some important matters. Leaving now with most of the royal guard present will prove to be a rather difficult task for the two of us.\" \n\n\nSophia sighed, feeling the excitement of tonight wane from her body. It took so much courage to even get so far as to have the mindset she had now, to leave this life and its cushiness. If she stayed any further, she feared that she would start to think of herself as an idiot for even wanting to walk away from a life of silk sheets, and carefully curated meals and treats. \n\n\nSophia Nevermore would begin to think of herself of being nothing but a child throwing a temper tantrum. \n\n\nThere was a part of her that wanted to accept Juliette\u0027s suggestion.

  "page 88": "What was once a budding prospering region, can be now be simply called the land of the dead. Nothing moved without the express permission that is granted by the children that commands every single minuscule thing. It seemed that even the flock of crows that soared overhead were artificial in their movements. The entire air of that place was stale, and the sooner anyone was out of it, the better they would most likely fill.\n\n\n\"Gods, bestow upon me mastery of the elements of this world, liquify and become a great surge!\"\n\n\nRoy raises a staff, which boosts his already steady grasp of the magical arts to unleash a great sweeping wave of water against a horde of charging dolls. It\u0027s all the time needed for the knights of rush in with their swords to drive them through the variety of re-animated creatures that stood in their way. \n\n\n\"I can\u0027t say I\u0027m surprised that we\u0027re facing down re-animated cattle, goblins, and people. They\u0027re relentless!\" \n\n\nEvie lets an arrow fly from her bow, one of countless many it seems that she\u0027s already fired today. Somehow they were able to battle themselves from the streets into the maze of a garden that was housed in the Cycla castle. The elf\u0027s rm was burning, but she was fighting to see another day, and so that she could be one of the instruments in what would hopefully be the demise of the evil pair of demons that made a mockery of life.\n\n\n\"That\u0027s fine with me! An archer is always practicing their perfect shot.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nELSEWHERE \n\n\nSophia walked flanked by her knights and attendant, the rattle and feel of chain mail underneath her clothing still something she was not yet entirely used to feeling. Unlike the first time she was on a battlefield, her senses remain steady, but the sadness she feels is something that she doesn\u0027t easily shake herself free of. Once more she was committing to murder, even as she watched another body hit the ground, their life force in the form of the bloody pile that lied in spilling now, she has to toughen her resolve. \n\n\n\"Here we are,\" Juliette speaks from the fog of war. Her close presence is something that helps Sophia keep her wits. There\u0027s a cool expression to the other woman\u0027s face. Although she doesn\u0027t show it, she is indeed hurt by the revelation of Paul\u0027s demise.\n\n\nA year was certainly enough time to form a bond that was rather close. \n\n\nStill, there was no time for mourning when faced with the door of the enemy\u0027s castle. \n\n\nSophia is the one who pushes said door open, being greeted by a bowing butler. There\u0027s other similarly dressed individuals, and there are faces among faces that both her and Juliette recognize. This is the kitchen staff, the cleaning staff, the garden staff, so many to name, but all of their fates were similar. \n\n\nStill this doesn\u0027t omit the fact that this is Frederic Crowmane, even if it wasn\u0027t entirely in the flesh.\n\n\n\"How long has it been since I\u0027ve seen your faces? Ah, is that Sophia, and Juliette? What fine women that you two are growing into. If I could still cry, I would, most assuredly.\" \n\n\nBoth women for their part, bow graciously at the man\u0027s comment, but it\u0027s Juliette who speaks first from the pair. \n\n\n\"You still maintain free will?\" \n\n\n\"Hardly. I\u0027m not much different from those that you\u0027ve both no doubt encountered here.\"\n\n\n\"So you must be suffering, then?\" Sophia asks the re-animated butler. \n\n\nThe old butler bows his head, grimacing as he rises as throwing knives enter between this fingers.\n\n\n\"I will be if I\u0027m successful in killing you two.\" \n\n\nSophia and Juliette are about to engage the butler before two familiar figures stand in front of them. It\u0027s both Evie and Roy, who while looking tattered and exhausted, still look ready to muster a fierce fight if need be. \n\n\n\"You two go on ahead and finish this.\" Roy musters as he slams his magic staff into the ground.\n\n\n\"Although I want to personally end those brats, it\u0027s more of your responsibility, right, princess?\" \n\n\nSophia looks back and forth between the two, unsure of the words to find to express gratitude without being aflamed from any embarrassment. But she was honeslty happy that she wouldn\u0027t have to fight the butler. From an emotional standpoint, the young woman was still readying herself for the battle against her younger siblings.\n\n\n\"Very well. You have my gratitude you two!\" Sophia remarks, turning to her knights who had accompanied her. \"Support these two! Me and Juliette will be fine going ahead by ourselves. At this point, there shouldn\u0027t be much in the form of resistance.\" \n\n\n\"Yes, your highness!\" \n\n\nFredric finds himself smiling despite himself at the sight. He seldom smiled, but today was indeed a fine day to die it seemed. He had been ready, but he hopes his opponents are as well. The butler watches as the two girls who he watched grow into the apparent commanders they were now run off to confront the very children who had turned him until whatever it was that he was exactly. Even despite it all, there was no malice or hatred, only disappointment in his own skills as a butler. \n\n\n\"Very well, then. Come at me as you please.\" \n\n\nRoy and Evie looked to the other, silently asking which one of them was to attack first.\n",

If you truly feel that your life\u0027s happiness will be granted elsewhere, then I only ask that we prepare and get some things in order before we depart.\" \n\n\nSophia relinquishes a sigh from her lips, not able to find any flaws in the logic of her attendant. \n\n\n\"Another night, then.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia Nevermore awakes to the sound of heavy commotion happening outside of her room, everything is so very loud. It\u0027s enough to even wake her up out of her much required rest to maintain the beauty given to her by the mutual combination of her parents, and the gods no doubt coming to an agreement. \n\n\n\"Princess!\" Juliette throws open her door, looking like she\u0027s been swallowed whole by a miniature tornado. \"W-We have to go!

There\u0027s going to be a great deal of change, and it\u0027s better I kill you than someone who would enjoy it.\" \n\n\nThe world turns gray, and the last thing Sophia Nevermore sees is a sword swinging down on her, and the world is tilted. Her head removed from her body.\n\n\nHer last thoughts are unanswered questions, as to why the captain of the royal guard would kill her\n\n\nA gruesome end, but fitting for a foolish princess.\n\n\nUnless you think otherwise? \n",
  "page 119": "The room is silent, and nobody opens their mouths to speak. That is because both Noel and Penelope have the floor to speak, and Sophia and Juliette are ever respectful towards that fact. \n\n\n\"First of all, have you been alright, Sophia?\" Penelope asks her sister, reaching out with a free hand to squeeze the one of her sister\u0027s. Her eyes grow wet with tears, but she\u0027s quick to shake them off. \"I almost feel unworthy as a big sister to even ask you that question. It\u0027s through the results of our actions that you\u0027ve had to do so much that you should have never had to do.\"\n\n\nSophia feels awkward until the weight of her sister\u0027s words. She remembers her always being so steadfast and confident, with a face that never displayed any emotions of weakness. \n\n\nHowever, maybe that Sophia herself placing unrealistic expectations on her. \n\n\n\"It truly is just us now that remains of the main family. Our blood might be in all corners of the kingdom, but only here in this very room does it swim so deeply in our veins.\" Noel speaks, placing a hand on Sophia\u0027s shoulder in very much a way that an older brother would to comfort their younger sibling. \n\n\nAll of this felt surreal to Sophia, especially considering her most recent interactions with her siblings.\n\n\n\"What you two will say... your explanations will make it all make sense, right? There\u0027s a reason for all of this bloodshed, it must be. Our father died because he absolutely did something that warranted such a thing, correct!?\" Sophia is desperate that the next words she hears from the two of them doesn’t make her disappointed and bitter.\n\n\nPenelope looks to struggle to say the next words that are at the very tip of her tongue. \n\n\n\"You can do it, Mary.\" It\u0027s Noel that gives her an encouraging squeeze of the hand. He gives her an affectionate look, and with his eyes silently tells her that he will be a source of strength that she could draw from. \n\n\nPenelope finally faces her sister\u0027s eyes. \n\n\n\"You look so much like mother now. I did onc-- no, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s still many of her traits I carry with me.\" Penelope trembles, but gets it under control before it becomes too noticeable. \"When I was your age, father would tell me as much, whenever he drunk too much and found his way in my bed. At first, I thought it was something that I could endure, and even grow to enjoy. I was telling myself I was father\u0027s favorite, but then he began looking at you the same way he once did me.\" \n\n\nSophia feels uneasy, her heart drums in her ears loudly. This couldn’t be true about the man who had given her everything she had ever wanted, treated her as best a father could for their daughter. The image she had created of him, the cracks were forming in her mind, and she places a hand over her breast to keep herself calm.\n\n\n\"Mother was a prodigy when it came to harnessing natural magic. Simply breathing in the earth, the air, it made a powerful foundation for her to draw from. Father however began to fear how powerful she had become, and that hurt mother deeply. So with her final spell, she made it so that the rose petals never stopped falling in the Rose Kingdom. It was so our father could never forget her, even if he found another woman. Such a spell of permanently manipulating the world itself, it takes great sacrifices.\"\n\n\nNoel steps forward. \n\n\n\"A limb, parts of your mind, memories, your life is sometimes not enough. Sometimes the Gods need more if you want to perform the same feats as them. The sacrifices, it can turn the man you might have shared a bed with in the past, mad, or some of your children might end up with less magical aptitude than yourself, or none at all. It becomes a curse.\"\n\n\nPenelope\u0027s eyes glew a brilliant shade of blue.\n\n\n\"Sophia, it seems there\u0027s no curse on placed on you on that front. It\u0027s no wonder that Bridgette and Henry were overwhelmed by you despite having magic on the level that surpassed mages that have been studying magic for a decade or more. You probably had no idea, huh?\" \n\n\nThe queen exhales a long sigh she\u0027s been holding as her siblings spoke. \n\n\n\"So you both killed father because... of the heinous things he did to Penelope? I-I didn’t know that all this time you were suffering from having your pride repeatedly stepped on and disgraced.\" \n\n\nPenelope shook her head. \n\n\n\"Not at all. I used to think i was keeping his attention away from you if I did everything to make him happy. I thought I was the perfect older sister, protecting her young half. B-but that wasn\u0027t the case whatsoever! A part of me was angry, I was angry that he was throwing me away, discarding me like a used toy. But when brother confessed to me his feelings, how he had grown jealous of father taking me away from him... I knew I had my chance.\" \n\n\nThe two siblings embrace very much like lovers. Sophia and Juliette are unable to hide their appalled faces. \n\n\n\"It was a simple matter of getting into contact with Reginald. He wanted his crown and we wanted ours. The world would never accept our relationship, of me taking my sister to be my queen. We thought if we sacrificed all of you... they would have no choice, as we would have the most power out of every kingdom.\"\n\n\nNoel raises his hand, as if he\u0027s seeing a reality that could have been. \n\n\n\"But we\u0027ve realized,\" Penelope speaks for him in his stead. \"This world would never accept us. We would have to hide the truth from everyone until the day we die, and that\u0027s no good.\"\n\n\nThe two take several steps away from the two women. They stop at the large window in the room, it\u0027s already wide open as they both take a stand on the edge of said window. \n\n\n\"Any of our dreams became impossible when you marched upon the capital with such an outstanding number of soldiers. Zeska was the very last obstacle in your way. Noel speaks, looking back at his sister with a smile as Penelope does the same. \"We\u0027re very proud of the person you have become, but our fate is only justice. Every life that has been lost throughout the years, you can blame it on us.\" \n\n\nSophia runs forward, holding her hand out to stop them.\n\n\n\"Wai--\"\n\n\nNoel and Penolope only shake their heads.\n\n\n\"Goodbye, Sophia.\" \n\n\nWith those words they willingly plummeted several feet below. There\u0027s no way the woman has any power in her legs that could make her possibly fast enough to stop them from hitting the ground below. She can only grimace at the sound that their bodies make, and she quickly averts her gaze from having to see the results of their action. \n\n\n\"Your majesty, please get away from the window!\" \n\n\nEver the protective woman that she was, Juliette grabs Sophia and pulls her away from the scene. \n\n\n\"I-I\u0027ll be fine. I just have to get my thoughts in order, Juliette.\" \n\n\nOh there was quite plenty she would have to get in order when it came to her mind. For now, Sophia Nevermore would have to pick up all of the fragmented pieces left by her siblings and put things back whole. A break was something that she wanted, to go back in her room and sleep for hours on end, but that was a luxury. \n\n\nFor now, she had to let her kingdom know that the victory was hers.\n\n\nNo matter how bitter and disgusting victory tasted. \n",

He is the picture perfect definition of someone who is a dashing prince that will put on a suit of armor and grab his trusted steed and fell a dragon if his princess was captured by one. As a young boy however, he was mischievous and always getting into trouble. One could classify him as a brat, and he did little to dispel that image of himself. As children, he would often claim himself as the superior noble between himself and Sophia.\n\n\nHowever as he matured, he quickly grew to be ashamed of his actions, going as far as apologizing to anyone who he may have said a cross word of.

She wouldn\u0027t let herself be at the mercy of her sisters torment. If their father dying was enough incentive for the two of them to want to claim her life, then she would rob them of theirs. There was no reservations, it was expected of royalty to eat one another like lions if the king lion himself found himself killed. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re crying, your highness.\" \n\n\nOf course she was crying. Sophia was disappointed that this was how things were. She didn\u0027t want to have to fight for her life, nor did she want to have to kill her own family just so that she could live. \n\n\nThe crown wasn\u0027t something that she wanted, and yet, there was no other path. \n\n\nSuddenly there\u0027s loud sounds of confrontation that drown the usual tavern/inn music, before said music completely stops. The two young woman exchange similar looks of confusion, hearing footsteps approaching their room, before stopping at their door.\n\n\n\"Girly, we know you\u0027re in there! Come on out and we won\u0027t have to get rough with you!\"\n\n\n\"Heh-heh, no promises. I might get a little too excited!\"\n\n\n\"Settle down! We don\u0027t want to scare them too much.\" \n\n\nJuliette immediately rushed over to the drawer, rummaging through it quickly in an alarmed state. It was only seconds that she was now brandishing a small blade. However against an unknown number of men that were presumably more armed and even dressed in appropriate wears for a battle, it wasn\u0027t much. \n\n\n\"Princess, please go through the window, okay? And do not not stop moving. It\u0027s unfortunate but it seems we\u0027ve been found by men that the highnesses have hired.\" \n\n\nSophia was at a loss. \"You can still call them by their titles?\" \n\n\n\"Be that as it may, princess, you must leave now! I will distract them! There\u0027s no time for any arguments pertaining to titles and the like!\" Juliet shot back as a piece of wood sailed from the room from the force of the door currently being roughed up from its hinges as the strange men made their attempts of breaching it. \n\n\nSophia could only look back and forth between the window and the door, as seconds ticked by. \n\n\nThis was a choice that hinged on the lines between life or death it seems. \n",
  "page 83": "~Year 18~\n\n\nIt\u0027s been a few days since princess  former princess Princess Sophia Nevermore and her ever faithful attendant, Juliette Forthwight had bunkered themselves in at an affordable tavern. Sure the sounds would get rowdy and reading would become out of the question once night fell, but it was a nice distance away from the palace itself. Juliette would leave in the morning, before returning as night fell. It was becoming worrying to say the least with how little the woman was sleeping, and how there seemed to be visible circles under her eyes from lack of sleep. \n\n\nThere was still money in their purses, so what was the point of her running herself ragged? \n\n\nSophia was becoming restless herself as she sat at the one table in the room, balancing a coin with her finger. Unlike her old room, there wasn\u0027t much of anything that could be done for killing boredom and idleness. No, all she could look forward to was awaiting the return of the diligent servant.\n\n\nThe door suddenly is thrown open, and Juliette appears looking both pale and frantic but when she spots Sophia staring at her with some alarm in her expression, she fights to calm her own nerves down. \n\n\n\"Julienne! Just what is the matter!? That was a rather improper way of making your presence known.\" \n\n\n\"M-my apologies, your highness,\" the attendant apologizes, though her downcast gaze shows that there are more heavier matters that are raising on her mind. \"There is some rather startling news to discuss. It is good that you\u0027re already sitting down for this.\" \n\n\nA sense of foreboding fills the air, but Sophia presses on for an answer anyway. \"How do you mean?\" \n\n\n\"The king, y-your father, he\u0027s been killed.\" \n\n\nSophia can only blink in response, unable to even come to a proper choice of words. It sounds like a terrible joke, but Juliette was never one for dark humor. However the woman only presses on in her explanation. \n\n\n\"They say it was a plot by prince regent Noel Nevermore, and the princess regent, Penelope Nevermore. T-The palace is in disarray, the kingdom... I know it\u0027s plenty to take in, but you must know. It\u0027s said that your twin sisters think it is you, and have employed men under their service to personally track you down and bring you to them alive so that you can be punish--\"\n\n\nSophia holds up a hand to stop her attendant from speaking any further. \n\n\n\"Father is dead. My older brother and sister seem to be the likely culprits, and my twin sisters want me brought to them.\"\n\n\n\"Yes?\" \n\n\n\"Who do you think is in charge now?\" \n\n\nJuliette ponders this question silently for a moment, \"I would say that all of you have equal claim the crown.\" \n\n\nSophia nods her head, resting a hand over her rapidly pulsating heart. This was all too much and happening far too fast for her to even wrap her mind around it all. She wanted to be strong, and be one that was able to rein over her emotions from spilling out, but this simply wasn\u0027t an ability that was in her repertoire. \n\n\nAll she had were her choices, to either continue to hide, or fight. \n\n\nWhat could possibly be the correct path that was laid out for her? \n",
  "page 86": "For some reason, leaving anytime that isn\u0027t tonight just doesn\u0027t sit right with the princess. It\u0027s now or never for the young woman, and she her body and mind are already in gear for a night exit without raising any alarm of suspicion. \n\n\n\"Juliette, I understand your concern, I certainly do, but isn\u0027t this night just perfect for the both of us to leave now?\" \n\n\nSophia looks for any room of argument, and Juliette does seem like she wants to raise a few points, but the look of adventure on the princess\u0027s face is almost too much for her to want to put out. In her mind, it was best to get these feelings out, than to suppress them in an unhealthy way. \n\n\nJuliette Forthwight would just have to do her best that Sophia didn\u0027t do too much to place herself in harm’s way and find herself getting hurt by the world that was outside the palace walls. \n\n\n\"Fine, I\u0027ll hasten the preparations, and I\u0027ll make sure there\u0027s enough provisions that we do not starve quickly. Oh! And money, yes, money is the thing that we\u0027ll need to get by as well. But how should we go about leaving? Will grabbing horses make too much noise, or should we brave leaving this place by foot?\"\n\n\nJuliette is talking to herself now, and Sophia thinks on which choice to the two of them should be going with to make their getaway.\n",
  "page 85": "\"I-I see, that\u0027s wonderful to know. Thank you, Juliette.\" \n\n\nSophia\u0027s current thoughts betray her words. It implied that she would do something to enter this race for the crown. No, it was all simply too much for her to deal with. It was only mere days ago that she was enjoying a relatively stress free life. A life in which everything was practically catered to her wants, and having to worry about whether or not someone would want her dead or not wasn\u0027t as prevalent. \n\n\n\"Well, I have no interest in partaking in such folly.\" Sophia already begins moving to pack her belongings, feeling the sting of cowardice. Her father, the man who had played some part in giving her life was murdered. \"Let\u0027s just stay out of this. If you don\u0027t want to follow me, then I\u0027ll make my own way in this worl--\" \n\n\nJuliette instantly wraps her arms around the princess. \n\n\n\"No, you do not have to say anything more. I\u0027ll handle everything, your highness.\" \n\n\n--x\n\n\nThings do not ever change, Sophia Nevermore and Juliette Forthwight go about changing their names so they can life with some semblance of peace.\n\n\nThe two move to a different kingdom in particular, and settle into a shabby home. \n\n\nJuliette works endlessly, without complaint. She was a woman ever devoted to the former noble princess.\n\n\nSophia Nevermore for her part does nothing, only lingers and rots away.\n\n\nOne day, she grows bored enough to leave the house, and she doesn\u0027t look as a horse-driven carriage makes little work in turning her into little more than broken bones and a bleeding out figure in the streets.\n\n\nThe princess doesn\u0027t make it, her injuries are too severe. \n\n\nAnd the woman whom had adopted the name of \u0027Julie\u0027 \n\n\nVanishes from the pages of history at this point\n\n\nIt\u0027s a fate fitting for a foolish princess, but perhaps it isn\u0027t on the other-hand. \n\n\nAs the one who turns the page, there\u0027s the freedom to decide.\n",
  "page 121": "Sophia tries to move her body to avoid the strike, and she does, barely. The wound on her arm however causes her to grit her teeth and hold onto her arm. The pain throbs, but she creates distance by shoving her arm right in-front of her body to smash into the chest of the woman. Zeska isn\u0027t affected, however she is forced back and looks down briefly surprised.\n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll be. Looks like you\u0027re planning something dangerous, I\u0027ll have to end it soon.\"\n\n\nSophia bit her lip to stop her breaths from coming out heavy. She doesn\u0027t want to reveal the extent of her pain, but her dominant arm which is the one she casts magic from. \n\n\n\"Likewise. Let\u0027s go, then.\"\n\n\n--x\n\n\nAlthough there isn\u0027t much in the way of fear that the woman feels\n\n\nThe Queen still bleeds, and still will die if a mistake is made.\n\n\nZeska charges again, Sophia doesn\u0027t back down as she moves to raise her arm.\n\n\nA surge of energy swirls thorghout the limb, but she\u0027s far too slow in getting feeling. \n\n\nA blade is pierced through her heart, and she\u0027s driven down into the ground. \n\n\nThe last thing she does is a defiant act, still raisng her hand to try and fire a blast of her energy.\n\n\nShe is however stopped by the last thing she sees, in the form of her sword driving down to remove her head from her body.\n\n\nAll it takes is one mistake to put an end to a tale.\n\n\nHowever, if this is an outcome found unagreeable, or even agreeable, then there\u0027s always a choice to either not make, or make. It goes both ways on whichever way you decide. \n",
  "page 5": "After having been properly pampered, dressed, and attended to by the various servants that scurried about the palace, Sophia Nevermore was on her lonesome. The palace itself really was quite grand and expansive. It always impressed Sophia the times in which she nearly found herself lost and even outright turned about a few times, someone always knew exactly where to locate her when she were a small curious child who had too much curiosity for her own good. While those days were now in the past, Sophia still didn\u0027t want to take any unnecessary turns if she could help it. \n\n\nTap, tap tap, tap, tap \n\n\nIt\u0027s the found of hurried footsteps scurrying off that brings Sophia out of her thoughts. It\u0027s a combination of feeling eyes on her and that sound in particular that gives the princess something of a small chill down her spine. The servants and many of the other workers were taught to not stare, unless directed specifically that it was allowed. Personally Sophia found it quite annoying, and teaching Juliette to not do something that was obviously being instilled into her was a headache of its own. Imagining Juliette needing to be taught anything was a bit hard to visualize, because the attendant always seemed to be so intelligent and wouldn\u0027t give an answer to a question in studies without knowing it be true. \n\n\nStill \n\n\nIt felt like such a piercing gaze that was on her, and yet, Sophia Nevermore found herself standing idly as her eyes narrowed around her environment. \n\n\n\"Oh my, is that little Sophie darling!?\" \n\n\n\"Is it really!? She is out of her room, such a surprise! And by herself, too!\"\n\n\nA pair of shrill voices is what greets Sophia, providing another moment of her concentration being torn away from her to settle on something new. Unfortunately for her, this \u0027new\u0027 thing wasn\u0027t anything that was exciting--or even new--for that matter. No, the shrillness and comments can come only in the form of her sisters, Cecilene and Aline Nevermore, both of whom where fraternal twins. This of course gave them a relationship and bond to each other that much closer when compared to that of their other siblings. There were only few of their actual kin whom they liked or regarded with varying degrees of tolerance to their existence. \n\n\nIt just so happened to be the case that Sophia didn\u0027t fall in either of those lists. For some reason, Sophia had always been at odds with her sisters. Sure she had siblings that she liked more than others, but she didn\u0027t go out of her way to vindictive to those she may have not had too close a relationship with. No, she had much better things to be doing with her time. \n\n\n\"Cecilene, Aline,\" Sophia looked back and forth between either twin, neither nervous nor amused by their antics.\n\n\nThere might have been a time in which their words may have had her nervous, but those times were done. She was no longer some helpless little girl, but a woman that had the potential of been a queen if she so desired. That was something neither of the twins could claim for one reason or another. \n\n\nBecause rumor had it that the twins were way into each other, than any handsome noble boy, prince, or king. Of course Sophia didn\u0027t know whether or not there was smoke to be found with such unbecoming rumors.\n\n\nHowever, it didn\u0027t hurt to entertain them from time to time, did it? \n",
  "page 18": "It would be rather rude and hypocritical of the young woman to leave now. It wasn’t as if this was some stranger whom she had no past with, this was her little sister and brother who she would be spending some time with. After the encounter with the pair of twin siblings of hers, Sophia could use a more cordial change of pace. \n\n\nThis can be a fine chance to be a remarkable older sibling. \n\n\nSophia took a seat in one of the chairs in the room, wrapping one of the strands of her hair on her finger and twirling from lack of any other better things to be doing with her time at the moment. \n\n\n\"Sister, I\u0027m here,\" A young boyish voice sounded in the air, and soon a mop of golden hair popped in the doorway. \"Is older sister Sophia joining us today?\" \n\n\n\"Why don\u0027t you see for yourself, brother?\" Bridgette answered back dismissively. \n\n\n\"A simple yes or no is always more appreciated.\" With that statement the small noble entered the room, hoisting up a painting stand and brushes tucked underneath his arm. It was a slightly humorous sight, given the individual\u0027s diminutive size. It would have been something that was more worrying if he had struggled and wobbled however. \n\n\n\"A-Ah!\" The noble boy almost does as his eyes lands on his elder sister. The shock of suddenly seeing her causes him to stumble slightly, fortunately for him, a pristine white glove presses on his back to settle his balance. \n\n\nThe white gloved hand belonging to none other than the head butler of the Nevermore\u0027s, Frederic Crowmane. \n\n\n\"Careful, young master,\" he intones. \n\n\nWith all of his mastery, he\u0027s able to keep a young prince from falling flat on his face in front of his sisters, while holding a tray which housed an array of treats and a kettle of carefully brewed tea sitting on that tray as well. To his proper attire, well groomed silver hair, and his ability to multitask a great many things, he was the optimal man to be bestowed the title of head butler of the Rose manor. It was a title he took with all of the seriousness of a failing heart. \n\n\n\"Are you okay, Henry?\" Sophia asks, standing up from her place. \n\n\n\"Y-yes! But yes, of course!\" He stammers as he places his drawing tools in the room. \n\n\nHenry Nevermore was perhaps the most talented when it came to crafting an eloquent drawing or painting. Even the work he considered to be scraps, some would consider works of art. However what exactly was he planning on drawing during a tea party? Sophia hadn’t the slightest clue to even start with.\n\n\n\"Oh by the way, Henry will be sketching us; this scene that we\u0027re apart of.\" Bridgette casually explains. \n\n\n\"Huh? Come again?\" \n\n\n\"Henry will be sketching us,\" The young girl repeats.  \n\n\n\"I see, but wouldn’t such a thing take quite a bit of time.\" \n\n\n\"You have that.\" \n\n\n\"Eh?\" \n",
  "page 8": "Sophia is unable to resist the beginning of a laughing fit as she regards her two sisters. \n\n\nIn blood and name, they were siblings, but when it came to anything else that was important. The princess refused to let them think that they were her superior. Even if there were two of them and only one of her, she figured that them needing one another was the only way to set things on an equal playing field. \n\n\n\"I guess we\u0027re all in for some surprises,\" Sophia remarks, settling her eyes and the line of her lips into ways that momentarily hid her true disdain. \"Shouldn\u0027t the two of you be hiding underneath a staircase somewhere, whispering sweet nothings into each other\u0027s ears?\" It was low-hanging fruit, and one the young princess wouldn\u0027t use if she could help it. The problem was that she didn’t believe her sisters to be worth the effort of bringing into fruition other more original insults on short notice. \n\n\nRegardless of personal feeling and wants, the desired reaction of getting under the skin of both of the twins seems a success. Both gasp audibly and look to the other to confirm what that they\u0027ve heard, the other heard as well. \n\n\n\"Kill her?\" \n\n\n\"Kill her!\" \n\n\nWith that a fight soon commences between the three women. It\u0027s a mess of hair pulling, pearls being snatched off of necklaces, and then hitting the ground, and a tear or two of fabric. To her credit, Sophia holds her own against both of her sisters, either through a surge of adrenaline or having a natural hidden aptitude for fighting that even she was unaware of. \n\n\n\"Are those our highnesses!?\" A female servant shouts to another, staring in shock at the scene before her. \n\n\n\"Y-Yes, someone has to stop this!\" Her male companion replies. \n\n\n\"What\u0027s going on here?\" A middle-aged woman appears, dressed in the clothing of a maid, but with an extravagant seal on her chest emerges, looking baffled at the sight of able bodies not moving.\n\n\n\"The princesses are fighting!\" One of the servant cries out. \n\n\n\"Fighting!? Of all the things--well--get the prince! I hear he\u0027s currently at the foyer, awaiting audience with his queen to be! Well, what are lot waiting for?! Hurry along now.\" Evelyn commands, shooing away the servants with a hand. With that taken care of, she would stand back and watch the scene play out with arms crossed. \n\n\nThe older woman was watching for something, to say the least. Just who out of these children could lead garrison of men to certain death, with false promise of them living to see the end of the a hopeless battle? Could they even inspire these hypothetical subjects to willingly give their lives for any cause? Although they were of age at this point, to the veteran palacekeeper, they were still immature to handle any true responsibility. But like with most things, time would certainly tell if all--no--if even one of the girls could blossom into women she didn\u0027t have to tear away from each other like brats. \n\n\n\"Can we break up all of these lovely princesses, please? I would appreciate some help here if known of you capable individuals of this estate mind?\" \n\n\nFortunately it seemed like a reprieve from any further attack on the older woman\u0027s patience was being stopped by the arrival of a certain prince from another--while still prestigious kingdom--a lesser kingdom in the form of the Aster Kingdom. The prince from this kingdom stood the picture perfect image of a respectable young man, tall, lean, well kempt, and despite all images snobby portrayals of nobles, respectful to all regardless of stations, sometimes to a fault, as it was it to the chagrin of other nobles in his circle. Yes this was a young man with a purpose of being here.\n\n\nThe fiancé, Caspar Holt. Who was of course more worried about the young woman whom he was actually bethroted to. Still, he couldn’t offer too much special treatment, as that wouldn’t be fair to her sisters. The prince figured that he\u0027d show fair treatment to the family of his soon to be wife. \n\n\nSoon enough, the ladies were pulled apart from each other\u0027s throats. With clothes amuck and hair in a state that isn\u0027t much better. However realizing the new presence that was regarding them they begin to do their best to fix and present themselves to the image of noble women. Evelyn felt that such attempts were already to far gone with the unbecoming nature of their actions, while Caspar was enjoying the amusing imagery that was right before his eyes. He would have begun laughing if it weren’t for the ladies honest attempts at looking embarrassed as they put forth their best effort. \n\n\n\"Prince Caspar, you didn’t think it prudent to tell us you were arriving?\" \n\n\n\"Yes, we always do look forward to having you here in our esteemed grounds.\"\n\n\n\"Certainly. He is heir to the Aster throne, and quite esteemed himself.\"  \n\n\n\"Very esteemed. How does spending the evening in our garden with tea and the finest delectable treats made by our very best cooks sounds? Surely it\u0027s far more enjoyable of a time than spending time with this sheltered little girl over there whom hardly leaves her room unless she has her attendant with her.\" \n\n\nSophia feels her face getting more and more red as the attempts of her sisters trying their hardest to woo her supposed husband to be into whatever schemes they\u0027ve had planned for him. Of course, they did eat together, bathe together, shared a room with each other despite there being so many other available rooms in the palace, so it wasn’t a surprise. Yes, it wasn\u0027t any surprise to Sophia that the two twin sisters of hers, whom were so attached to the hips, would do that with each other. She had to stop this from proceeding any further. It wasn\u0027t like she was doing this out of some jealousy or out some love for the prince, but to save him his virtue! That was her reason, and certainly not another factor was influencing that choice. \n\n\n\"Actually you two do have business of your own to attend to. There\u0027s a meeting with a highly valued investor, one that cannot allowed to be kept waiting.\" Evelyn cut in, unfolding her arms as she stepped into the center of the room. \n\n\n\"Investor? An investor you say? Can we just not do that today?\" It\u0027s Aline that says this almost pleadingly, Cecilene entirely quiet. \n\n\nEvelyn only shakes her head at the princess, a look of inquisitive wonder briefly on the aged woman\u0027s features. However she doesn\u0027t press it as she opens her mouth to speak once more.\n\n\n\"No. It\u0027s a personal request from his majesty himself,\" Evelyn states. \n\n\nThose words alone are enough to stamp out any other forms of resistance from the twin princesses who can only nod their heads in unison. For a moment, the duo looks drained before they settle matching glares at Sophia. \n\n\n\"What a lovely life you have, sister.\" Those are their parting words before walking away with Evelyn. \n\n\nSophia is only left confused by her sisters words. Weren’t all of their lives pretty lovely? Being born into a prestigious noble bloodline, and not just any bloodline, but one with rights and ties to the crown. Why would only her life be lovely when both of them were born into the same house with the same pedigree and last name? \n\n\nShe\u0027s unable to process this further as Caspar closes a black gloved hand over hers.\n\n\n\"Do you mind if we go out into the balcony for some fresh air, Sophie?\" \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t mind, but it\u0027s Sophia. All of these years, and you don\u0027t remember?\" \n\n\n\"Haha, but of course, how could I forget. I was just trying to, ah, nevermind it. Let us away, then.\" \n",
  "page 7": "Built hundreds of years before the current family\u0027s time. The Rose Kingdom stands as a true representative of the rich history that the kingdom itself has. It\u0027s fortified quite heavily, so that meant that nothing less than an impressive army in both size and power could easily topple it\u0027s walls and cause the foundation to crumble.\n\n\nIt\u0027s said that many of the country\u0027s wealth goes into up-keeping this castle. Another thing that is said is that the palace can more than occupy more than hundreds of people with the vast amount of rooms it has that goes un-used. One could argue that it\u0027s a pillar of hubris for some, but a source of strength for some as well. \n\n\nRegardless of what one might think of this castle, it has stood for many years, and many are doubtless that it will ever stop doing just that. \n",
  "page 2": "Rose Kingdom is a large kingdom, rich in abundance when it comes to crops and materials. Originally founded by a group of nobles, it was one family that was looking towards the future of survival and securing their claim of their nobility for years to come. That family would be the Nevermore\u0027s, and at the time it would be through the cunning actions of the patriarch of that family who made careful investments and claims to important landmarks and ports. \n\n\nHe went by the name of Ramus Nevermore. With his careful plotting, trading, and even outright buying of the possessions of his own allies, and growing to be even more advantageous and profitable for him. This of course made the Nevermore\u0027s one of suspicions and plots to outright destroy them were held under many a secret meeting. \n\n\nThe one family that would stand beside the Nevermore\u0027s would be the Holt\u0027s. Telling them of this impending betrayal, Ramus Nevermore joined hands with the leader at the time, Richard Holt. \n\n\nSoon a great war would take place, and many families who at first were against the Nevermore\u0027s and Holt\u0027s, would try and fall under their banner when it seemed like victory was in hand for the two. Only one family was granted this right, and they would eventually become known as the Forthwights. It was because they maintained careful neutrality of the matter, watching as victory would swing for both sides at different times, but they would join out of a sense of fealty. \n\n\nOnce the war had ended, The Rose kingdom enjoyed long periods of success. \n\n\nA motif that was adopted was growing roses in abundance. Nowadays, one could make the argument that they have gone soft in their pursuit of adorning its upper class with great beauty. \n",
  "page 1": "Ever since she can remember, baths have been a welcome part of Sophia\u0027s day. Even though it was not the case that all of her worries were melting away, it certainly did feel like it! Her vanilla scented bath did its job in calming her nerves for the coming day and its viles that was no doubt in store for her. It was a true blessing, being born in the lap of luxury and being able to enjoy the comforts of her large stone bath that stretched in the entirety of the room that it was situated for. It really brought many thoughts to the forefront of her mind as another lather of soap found its way down her neck. \n\n\nJust how did the common folk go about cleansing themselves when they did not have such large baths? \n\n\nIt was certainly a conundrum that Sophia couldn’t even begin to fathom on her part. Thus she let the thought cast itself away as quickly as it had came to her head. No, she only had the time to think of her own situation and not the lives of others at the moment. After all, she was the one that was experiencing a great crisis within herself. If it wasn\u0027t for the gentle aroma of vanilla and even-- was that lavender? In her vicinity, she was sure she would crack like one of the vast vases that decorated the halls of the estate. No, she had to be much stronger. As royalty, as one with noble and prized blood swimming throughout her body, she had to steel herself as only Sophia Nevermore could. \n\n\n\"Is the bath to your liking, your highness?\" \n\n\nThe question comes poised from Julliette, who keeps a careful eye on the princess even while she keeps a hand in the water to keep check of the temperature. \n\n\n\"Yes, I feel so light now, like I\u0027m floating in a cloud above the sky,\" Sophia answered. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m very glad to hear that, your highness,\" Juliette smiled, beginning to hum to herself as she continued the process of the bath. \n\n\nSilence soon fell over both of the young women. The brief small talk did not erase the reality of the subject that they were not yet broaching. Juliette was keeping quiet because she was ever the respectful attendant of the princess. The princess in question was silent because she was brooding, and her thoughts were something she had to piece together to find the appropriate word choice at this moment. There was a long day ahead for both of them, and thus, there really was no time to dawdle in her naked splendor. As tempting as the thought of enjoying a relaxing bath was for the entirety of the day, she was sure the silent Juliette was expecting  her to eventually speak. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ve always noticed since I was a child, how my brothers often had so many more opportunities to go out and claim their birthrights, grab as many wives as they wanted, concubines, and even servants and slaves. You can say that even my sisters have had their own chances to make something of themselves! Does my father see me as so incapable of doing the same?!\" \n\n\nSophia paused, taking a moment to realize how her chest was rising and falling as she said these words. She was practically heaving before she knew any better, no doubt an unbecoming sight for royalty. However it was one such action that she had the luxury of doing in her current privacy.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t think that is the case, your highness. Maybe his majesty wants to keep you protecte--\" \n\n\n\"No! Don\u0027t you realize, Juliette?\"\n\n\nSophia turned around to face her attendant fully, rising from the water unabashed with her hands tightening into fists. Her ire was in no way directed to the person who had been in her presence since her childhood, no, not at all. But she had to get her point across fully to the other woman, it was absolutely dire that she did so. It was dire because she didn’t think her next words would be able to tumble from her lips if she didn\u0027t have the understanding and support of the other woman.\n\n\nNot that she would ever admit that verbally. \n\n\n\"If I don\u0027t do something now, this will be it! I\u0027ll never be anything but someone to pump out someone\u0027s children over and over again! Until I become sickly and die like mother did!\" \n\n\nThere\u0027s a silence that follows Sophia\u0027s exclamation, and for a moment only the sound of moving water could be heard as Juliette processes her thoughts. If her assumptions were correct, which she really would have liked to not be the case. Sophia would no doubt tell her that she wanted to run away from the kingdom, and do what exactly? By looking at the expression her face, the young princess seemed to be at her wits end about her situation. While the princess had grown up to be a wonderful woman, there was still so much she yet to learn about the world and how things really worked. If she was to do something such as running alone on her lonesome, the very thought sent a shiver up Juliette\u0027s mind as she could only imagine the scenarios that the princess would find herself in due to her inexperience. \n\n\nStill, as an attendant and a young woman woman herself, there was only so much she could do or offer. However offering even something was better than nothing. \n\n\n\"I-I see, your highness, I\u0027ll make the preparations. Until then, please, behave like you always do, as counterproductive as that may sound to you.\" \n\n\nThe implications of that response didn\u0027t miss the princess who arched one of her brows meticulously to stare oddly at the other woman. Her expression was tensing and trying to find a hidden meaning behind the statement, and eventually, realization dawned on her before she was left frowning. \n\n\nHow excellent \n\n\nIt was a thought that Juliette had even as Sophia began chewing her out for her small little jab. It certainly helped lightened the mood, and it brought a bit of comfort to in small measure to the attendant as well. Because running away certainly wasn\u0027t going to be without its fair share of hardship, and small lighthearted moments like this, there was even a chance that they would be hard to come by.\n",
  "page 4": "Juliette Forthwight is the honorable and extremely loyal attendant of Sophia Nevermore. A little known fact is that the very last act on this world that Sophia\u0027s mother did, was make sure that the daughter of her close friend Rebecca Forthwight would get along with her own daughter. \n\n\nMuch of Juliette\u0027s personality stems from the intense training that was instilled in her through her family. The Forthwight\u0027s have a long history of being loyal to the main family that is the Nevermore\u0027s. However unlike probably many of the attendants that came before, a genuine relationship was able to be formed between both Juliette and Sophia. \n\n\nAt first, Sophia felt like she didn’t need someone who was only a year older than her to play \u0027nanny\u0027 for herself. But after many scenarios in which Juliette had proven herself, like preparing meals, standing ever ready to provide Sophia with a much needed item, or even finding or making a replacement for things that have been misplaced. \n\n\nOutside of just that, Juliette\u0027s presence became something that Sophia became used to. \n",

She also winds up being the younger sibling to both Noel Nevermore and Penelope Nevermore. \n\n\nOne way to describe Sophia is that she\u0027s had quite a sheltered upbringing in comparison to her other siblings. Nobody but her father, the king himself knows why he keeps her at that palace all day. \n\n\nSophia is seldom allowed freedom to pursue any interests outside of the palace, and when she does, it\u0027s heavily observed by carefully chosen guards. Such a living has made the young woman ignorant to most things, and it\u0027s only due to the kingdom\u0027s best tutors and having an outlet in the form of Juliette Forthwight to speak with, does the young woman not come off wholly sheltered. \n\n\nMost situations that any normal person with a sense of imminent danger coming their way can avoid, will sometimes be something that goes amiss for her. This has an odd effect of making her quite courageous at times. \n\n\nThere\u0027s a great potential for her, if she can reach out and grasp it despite all of her foolishness.\n",

If there was someone who my father wanted me to spend my life with, you\u0027re not a bad choice at all, Caspar.\" \n\n\nCaspar can only slowly nod his head, sinking into himself as he clasps his hands infront of his bowed head.

  "page 13": "The afternoon sun washes the two young lovers in a warm glow. The balcony of the Rose Palace was bigger than most most people\u0027s bedrooms, and was quite sizable to hold a party of people if needed. Needless to say it was quite accommodating in playing host for both Sophia Nevermore and the prince of Aster, Caspar Holt, as they shared and reaffirmed the great love they have felt each other since the first time their eyes met, all of those years ag--\n\n\n\"Why are you here!? I thought I made it quite clear that your face is something I could do without seeing for awhile!\" Sophia exclaimed, crossing the balcony in a circular pace, arms also crossed as she chewed on her thumb. \n\n\nCaspar for his part kept a composed neutral expression. He figured that he had to be understanding of his wife to be plight. \n\n\n\"I must stress that I still am very sorry for what occurred in the dinner party those months ago. What I did was... inconsiderate, unsavory, and if I can take it back, surely I woul--\" \n\n\nSophia raises a hand to stop him from speaking any further, red dusting her cheeks as she recalls the memory herself. \n\n\nIt was months ago, Sophia was gladly enjoying staring out of the window of her room until the crown prince himself decided that she should \u0027enjoy the festivities\u0027 of the party. It wasn’t like it was an important event, such as the founding of the Rose Kingdom itself, but a standard typical ball in which the young woman felt her presence would not be necessary to liven things up. After all, there were so many other of the Nevermore bloodline who enjoyed such things as dressing up and mingling with other important individuals and delegates from foreign nations that she had only read from books. \n\n\nBut no, Caspar took it upon himself to bring her out of her room to enjoy whatever atmosphere there was to enjoy. Of course her dress and hair were impeccable, as it always was even on lazy days. Beauty was a weapon that could be used to protect yourself ands help others. That beauty extended to the physical being and should also be applied to one\u0027s inner self. \n\n\nA lesson taught by her ever busy and traveling older sister: Penelope Nevermore.  \n\n\nNow where was this going? Sophia had danced and danced with many of the hands that were offered to her. After all, she was a rare sight to see on the dance floor. She didn\u0027t blame the men and women that had attended from being unable to withhold their desires to behold her in her full splendor with a close proximity. However, so much dancing had left her quite out of sorts and she ended up spilling her drink on a rather important delegate.\n\n\nWhy would the ever dazzling and near perfect princess that was Sophia Nevermore even spill a drink? It was the result of hearing of her father\u0027s apparent disapproval of her accepting many of the offers given to dance. \n\n\nAfter all, he preferred her to stay in her room, and only allowed to leave outside with a trusted attendant and the best guards that the kingdom could afford to give her on her strolls. Even then, she was only allowed to go out a certain distance and that just so happened to result in her never personally meeting any persons that could be considered of \u0027common\u0027 birth. Of course like any curious young woman she wanted to do so much more, but she was grateful for the things her father had offered her.\n\n\nAnd it was all thanks to Caspar that she behaved in such an improper and embarrassing way. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ve never seen father so angry, and part of his ire was directed at me, because of you, remember?\" \n\n\n\"Actually, I\u0027m sure the king wouldn’t have minded if I were drawn and quartered for what I did.\" \n\n\n\"You\u0027re quite a lucky little prince, Caspar Holt.\" \n\n\n\"Eh, little, huh?\" \n\n\nCaspar trailed off with a small amused laugh, staring intently at the haughty little princess before him. The woman certainly looked please with putting him through a verbal lashing, as she always was. Secretly, though he would admit to nobody but perhaps his closet attendant, he found Sophia\u0027s way of speaking both honest, but certainly quite refreshing. \n\n\nIn the content expression on her face, he could feel and see the comfortable familiarity on her face even with eyes closed. \n\n\nSo just like that, both of the young nobles fell into a comfortable silence. This wasn\u0027t a difficult thing to do when the person you were spending your time with was someone you have been familiar with since childhood. And for one of the individuals, a person you were hopelessly fond of to the point of lov--a familial love--yes, that was what this was.\n\n\nAn arranged marriage between two kings, shaking the other\u0027s hand with drinks and food flowing. Oh to them it was a throwaway thing to do, but to the two whom actually would be husband and wife, prince to king, and a princess to queen, it wasn\u0027t as easy. \n\n\n\"So, it\u0027s at the end of the month,\" Caspar takes a pause, \"How do you feel about that, Sophie?\" \n\n\n\"Again with the \u0027Sophie\u0027 thing, prince Caspar Holt?\" Sophia began, but stopped when she saw the rather serious expression on the boy\u0027s--scratch that, please--the man\u0027s face. He was looking at her in a way that a man would look at a woman he was fond of, and quite frankly, it had her at quite a loss! \n\n\nJust how did Sophia Nevermore feel about this? \n",

It was quite embarrassing, and it becomes even more so as she\u0027s lifted from her feet and swung around in a hug.\n\n\n\"Okay, okay, put me down!\" \n\n\nCaspar does as he is told, laughing sheepishly. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry. It just makes me happy that the sentiment is shared here. I hope you understand, Sophia. I was starting to think the entire arrangement made on our father\u0027s behalf was making you upset.\"\n\n\nOh, if only he knew. It had nothing to do with him entirely, but it was a combination of things.\n\n\n\"Older sister, Sophia.\" \n\n\nBoth occupants of the balcony turn to heads to see a young girl holding onto a stuffed doll, poking her head out over the stuffed animal that she holds to her chest.

  "page 15": "\"Sure, that doesn’t sound like a terrible thing.\" Sophia turned on a heel, jutting her index finger out to the direction of the doll holding girl. \"You must show your new creations! Even the ones that you have deemed as failures, as I will not be taking no for an answer since you\u0027ve personally requested my presence.\" \n\n\nBridgette frowned, not liking the prospect that was being proposed to her. \n\n\n\"What if I don\u0027t want to show the bad ones?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, that won\u0027t do.\" Sophia wagged her finger now, \"Part of being a good host is being accommodating to any guests that you may invite. Think of this little nugget of information as a gift that I am giving to you as the elder sister.\" \n\n\nBridgette sighed in defeat, shoulders slumping. \n\n\n\"Yes, yes, I\u0027ll gladly take in this new information from you, sister.\" She began walking off, presumably to her bed chambers. \"I\u0027ll be waiting. There are certain things that must be prepared in advance.\" \n\n\nWith the young girl making her exit, Caspar looked to Sophia. \n\n\n\"There was something I had to say, but, ah, I have an audience with your father to make.\" \n\n\n\"Is that so? Good luck.\" \n\n\n\"Phia, is that all you have to say? I might die, y\u0027know?\" \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Sophia turned and grabbed the scruff of the prince\u0027s shirt. He was taller than her, very much so, and this was a way of bringing him down to eye level. After all, when you looked down on someone in the literal sense... \"Your little pet names for me continue to shorten. Please work on fixing that.\"\n\n\nShe releases him as he laughs her off sheepishly, looking down at wrinkled garment. \n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll have to fix this first. Then, reflect on my behavior it seems.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia pokes her head into the room of Bridgette. Immediately she is greeted by the sight of many dolls meticulously lined up and positioned in a way for maximum aesthetic effectiveness. The room\u0027s color palette was a gentle lavender, from the curtains, to the rug that was beneath her shoes, and even the bed sheets. \n\n\n\"There seems to be even more from last time,\" Sophia mused out-loud, looking around for the sight of her younger sister. \n\n\n\"Inspiration isn\u0027t something that should be left lingering. My teacher told me that,\" Bridgette answered from behind. \n\n\n\"Ah!\" Sophia shouted in alarm, whirling around and stumbling backwards at the sudden shock of not expecting to hear a voice from at her back all of a sudden. \"Didn\u0027t you not say that you were going on ahead? How does the guest arrive before the host? Does such a thing not sound slightly off to you, Bridgette?\" \n\n\nThe young girl only shrugged as a reply, moving over to a small table she had situated in her room and taking a seat. \n\n\n\"How about we begin?\" She asks to her older sibling. \n\n\n\"Begin what?\" \n\n\n\"Drawing your portrait, of course. Henry is also arriving, and Fredric\u0027s preparing snacks.\" \n\n\nSophia felt a headache forming at all of this new information being revealed one after the other. If Bridgette had her own weird tendencies at times, the younger brother Henry eclipsed her in several areas. Sophia would always feel his eyes lingering on her, but he would never reply \u0027yes\u0027 to the question if there was something that he needed. Perhaps it was a shy thing? Sophia couldn’t possibly come up with an answer because she was no reader of the minds. As for Frederic Crowmane; he was the head butler of the estate, and a man who was always prim, proper, and stern in some ways. \n\n\nHow was a princess to survive such an encounter? \n",
  "page 9": "Sophia chooses not to engage with her sisters. There were bigger things on her mind than engaging in petty spats like they were still immature children. Well, maybe they were, but she had a much greater outlook on herself. \n\n\n\"Poor Sophia! Scared until the very end, isn’t she, Aline?\"\n\n\n\"That she is! One almost wonders why she even bothered to leave her room.\" \n\n\nDo not give them the satisfaction they so desperately crave, Sophia Nevermore.\n\n\nIt\u0027s at the moment of closing her eyes and gritting her teeth, does Sophia bump into a very broad chest. She instinctively holds her nose, rubbing gingerly at as she looks to see the culprit of her current pain. However she soon finds herself having to look up at the individual in question, and she feels her face immediately go pale. \n\n\nNone other than Caspar Holt stood before her, craning his neck slightly so that he could flash her one of his smiles that she found rather annoying. It almost made her want to smile, and that was out of the question for...reasons. Everytime he did something that was even slightly charming, it made her feel both guilty and dumb. Just why was she doing this anyway? She would wonder. Those sorts of thoughts were dangerous for a princess whom was preparing to escape the castle. \n\n\nSuddenly she\u0027s shoved aside by the combined backsides both of her sisters, being sent stumbling off balance as they both spared no glance at her wellbeing from their very rude action.\n\n\nHer posture is fixed and settled correctly by the hands of the head maid, Evelyn. She was a woman who earned both the fear and respect of just about everyone, despite her occupation. \n\n\nShe was certainly a woman to admire.\n\n\n\"T-Thank you,\" Sophia said, earning a nod from the woman. \n\n\nSophia then watches as her sisters practically throw themselves at Caspar.\n\n\n\"Prince Caspar, you didn’t think it prudent to tell us you were arriving?\" \n\n\n\"Yes, we always do look forward to having you here in our esteemed grounds.\"\n\n\n\"Certainly. He is heir to the Aster throne, and quite esteemed himself.\"  \n\n\n\"Very esteemed. How does spending the evening in our garden with tea and the finest delectables made by our best cooks sounds? Surely it\u0027s far more enjoyable of a time than spending time with this sheltered little girl over there whom hardly leaves her room unless she has her attendant with her.\" \n\n\nSophia feels her face getting more and more red as the attempts of her sisters trying their hardest to woo her supposed husband to be into whatever schemes they\u0027ve had planned for him. Of course, they did eat together, bathe together, shared a room with each other despite there being so many other available rooms in the palace, so it wasn’t a surprise. Yes, it wasn\u0027t any surprise to Sophia that the two twin sisters of hers, whom were so attached to the hips, would do that with each other. She had to stop this from proceeding any further. It wasn\u0027t like she was doing this out of some jealousy or out some love for the prince, but to save him his virtue! That was her reason, and certainly not another factor was influencing that choice. \n\n\n\"Actually you two do have business of your own to attend to. There\u0027s a meeting with a highly valued investor, one that cannot allowed to be kept waiting.\" Evelyn cut in, unfolding her arms as she stepped into the center of the room. \n\n\n\"Investor? An investor you say? Can we just not do that today?\" It\u0027s Aline that says this almost pleadingly, Cecilene entirely quiet. \n\n\nEvelyn only shakes her head at the princess, a look of inquisitive wonder briefly on the aged woman\u0027s features. However she doesn\u0027t press it as she opens her mouth to speak once more.\n\n\n\"No. It\u0027s a personal request from his majesty himself,\" Evelyn states. \n\n\nThose words alone are enough to stamp out any other forms of resistance from the twin princesses who can only nod their heads in unison. For a moment, the duo looks drained before they settle matching glares at Sophia. \n\n\n\"What a lovely life you have, sister.\" Those are their parting words before walking away with Evelyn. \n\n\nSophia is only left confused by her sisters words. Weren’t all of their lives pretty lovely? Being born into a prestigious noble bloodline, and not just any bloodline, but one with rights and ties to the crown. Why would only her life be lovely when both of them were born into the same house with the same pedigree and last name? \n\n\n\"Do you mind if we go out into the balcony for some fresh air, Sophie?\" \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t mind, but it\u0027s Sophia. All of these years, and you don\u0027t remember?\" \n\n\n\"Haha, but of course, how could I forget. I was just trying to, ah, nevermind it. Let us away, then.\" \n",

He is the picture perfect definition of someone who is a dashing prince that will put on a suit of armor and grab his trusted steed and fell a dragon if his princess was captured by one.

My teacher told me that,\" Bridgette answered from behind. \n\n\n\"Ah!\" Sophia shouted in alarm, whirling around and stumbling backwards at the sudden shock of not expecting to hear a voice from at her back all of a sudden. \"Didn\u0027t you not say that you were going on ahead? How does the guest arrive before the host? Does such a thing not sound slightly off to you, Bridgette?\" \n\n\nThe young girl only shrugged as a reply, moving over to a small table she had situated in her room and taking a seat. \n\n\n\"How about we begin?\" She asks to her older sibling. \n\n\n\"Begin what?\" \n\n\n\"Drawing your portrait, of course.

  "page 97": "Sophia walked alongside the courtyard. Somehow enough time had passed that the sun was now no longer out, and the stars were now aligning the sky above. Looking at the large outstretched pond that passed along her path to the gazebo, the young woman wondered on whether or not something would feel amiss in her life without ever being able to see a view like this. \n\n\nHer choice was something that was already made, and despite some reservations, she wouldn’t take it back. \n\n\n\"Well, the time for regrets aren’t appropriate now.\" She mumbled to herself, stopping as she heard footsteps behind her heels, and a familiar presence join her side. \n\n\nOf course it was none other than her ever faithful attendant, Juliette. \n\n\n\"Your highness, Sophia,\" she addressed softly, falling in step with the woman. \"If we\u0027re to leave, it would have to be tomorrow night.\" Juliette tells her. \n\n\nConfusion instantly settled in on Sophia. Why would it have to be tomorrow night? Was there some new information that was gathered by her attendant on another being a more ideal one of finally escaping from her cushy prison of life. It didn\u0027t take long for that confusion to turn into some agitation at that feeling of confusion. \n\n\n\"Why do you say tomorrow?\" \n\n\n\"Your father is to ride out tomorrow with Prince Holt back to his kingdom for some important matters. Leaving now with most of the royal guard present will prove to be a rather difficult task for the two of us.\" \n\n\nSophia sighed, feeling the excitement of tonight wane from her body. It took so much courage to even get so far as to have the mindset she had now, to leave this life and its cushiness. If she stayed any further, she feared that she would start to think of herself as an idiot for even wanting to walk away from a life of silk sheets, and carefully curated meals and treats. \n\n\nSophia Nevermore would begin to think of herself of being nothing but a child throwing a temper tantrum. \n\n\nThere was a part of her that wanted to accept Juliette\u0027s suggestion. As her attendant, she would never tell the princess anything that could potentially bring her harm and to ruin. \n\n\nBut maybe it was time for her to make her own choices, and follow her own instincts for once? \n",

  "page 134": "Camping, making camp, this is what they called what Sophia and Juliette were doing. \n\n\nBoth women would no doubt be more excited if there weren\u0027t a multitude of men out to get them at the behest of Sophia\u0027s sisters, Aline, and Ceciline. For all intents and purposes, they were in a much better state of being than the both of them. No doubt they had their own castle to fire off such orders as having Sophia captured, and of course having able bodied individuals to carry out and bring these orders into being. \n\n\nNow Sophia Nevermore and Juliette, chased out from their lodgings, were now in hiding in a wilderness. It really was only a matter of time before the enemies would start picking up on any trails left behind, so they didn\u0027t have a wealth of time of doing anything besides making a modest fire and eating the last of their provisions which consisted of bread that was now stale.\n\n\nIt\u0027s been even more days since Sophia\u0027s father been killed by someone from her family. \n\n\nShe didn’t want to believe it, but it was now a certain reality. \n\n\nThere was no further persons in her bloodline to turn to. If she was to even turn in the direction of her family, she would now have to be prepared to defend her life. \n\n\n\"We need men of our own,\" Sophia spoke out-loud, feeding a small piece of wood to further feed their flame.\n\n\n\"Remember, not too much, your highness. We\u0027re in hiding from some rather dangerous people from the sounds of it.\" Juliette hugged her knees, her face pondering. \"Yes, for protection, that would be nice.\" \n\n\n\"Yes, we have to pay those twins a visit.\" \n\n\n\"Come again?\" \n\n\n\"Juliette, how long will we run for our lives? What\u0027s next for us? Do we allow ourselves to be chased to the point in which we\u0027re living in holes on the ground, only coming up to eat worms? I say that we should repay my sisters kindness and hospitality. They\u0027ve sent such unsavory men after us, so I do feel it is only right.\" \n\n\nFor her part, Juliette looked hesitant with the proceedings of this conversation, before Sophia covered both of her hands with her own, and looked into her eyes with the greatest amount of honesty she felt that an individual could muster. \n\n\n\"I can\u0027t do this alone, as you may already know. So, will you help me as you always have thus far?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, of course, your highness.\" \n\n\nWith that affirmation, the two woman would conspire in that wilderness for potential allies to recruit to their banner. \n",
  "page 29": "Had the other woman gone mad and lost all of her sanity? \n\n\nEven if Sophia were to leave her, just what would she do? There was a very slim chance of Juliette being able to hold off a group of men, and that meant she could very well be killed, or much worse. If that happened to be the case, and even if she were able to get away, how would she even go upon feeding herself and surviving? Surely, someone of her stature could be well, but the sadness of her attendant dying a meaningless death in some ratty tavern would no doubt prove to be a hinder on her emotional state, to say the least. \n\n\nYes, that was the reason why Sophia Nevermore was turning around, despite a part of her that wanted to very much just get away from this situation. However, if that meant potentially leaving her loyal attendant to sacrifice herself, she had a better plan in mind. \n\n\n\"Princesss, what are you doin--\"\n\n\n\"Silence! If you don\u0027t want yourself, or your princess dying here before we can truly begin, then listen to my orders!\" \n\n\nJuliette was stunned into silence, seeing this side of the princess springing into action. So she awaited orders, and waited some more as she stared at Sophia to finally say what course of action for them to be taking. Time was indeed of the essence after all, and quite frankly there were a lack of choices that she could find herself making to keep themselves both alive. \n\n\n\"What do you say that we do, Juliette? Die together perhaps?\" \n\n\nThe attendant doesn\u0027t at first react, trying to see if she perhaps misheard the other women speaking. However as the seconds passed, that didn\u0027t seem likely. \n\n\n\"Ah, well,\" There\u0027s more banging from the door, and it looks to be on it\u0027s last hinges. \"We should barricade the door.\" \n\n\nSophia nodded her head in firm agreement, moving to the desk and leaning forward with her hands on the surface. \n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll need your help, then! Miss attendant.\" With those words spoken, the two young women moved to successfully push the beds against the door, before both using much of their combined strength to move the lone desk in the room against the doorway as well, providing some obstacles to prevent the door from easily being able to be opened from the other side.\n\n\nWhile Juliette stared at their handiwork, Sophia quickly paced the room, bundling the bed sheets under her arms, before beginning the process of tying them to the window.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s not waste a second any more in this place!\" \n\n\nWith those words spoken, the two ladies exited through the window. Landing on the side streets of the tavern without any harm yet done to their persons. So far, the situation wasn\u0027t one that was wholly hopeless. \n\n\n\"Oi! There they are!\" \n\n\nAs if spoken too soon, the hired thugs were instantly moving to ensnare them again. Loose arrows sailed over their heads, as they ran as fast as they could. It was difficult moving with a dress, a thought that flittered through the princess\u0027s mind before she decided it was a thought that she didn’t want to think again.\n\n\nRip, rip, rip\n\n\nSophia threw the tatters of her dress in the face of one of the hired men chasing her, which had the result of making him slam into a barrel and trip up two of his allies. It also provided the two young women with another window to get on both of their horses and speed their way through the night, putting the horrible events of the night away from them. However they both knew it was only temporarily, as tomorrow they would no doubt be faced with an important decision to make. \n",

  "page 137": "The current king of the Rose Kingdom, and the patriarch of the Nevermore family, is none other than Oliver Nevermore. Even when a fresh-faced young man, barely out of his teens, he cast an imposing shadow over most of his peers, and even the older men in his family. Although he was a king that wouldn’t be winning any competition involving advanced mathematics, he made up for it by running the fastest, and being the strongest, which a great deal would consider good qualities for a king that would be on the battlefield to have. And be on the the battlefield, was something Oliver wanted more than anything. \n\n\nAlthough his ascension to king over his many other peers seemed to be something that was more sure than anything. Before he was the king, Oliver allowed himself the opportunities to claim glory for himself by defeating many fierce commanders. While strong, he was no mere fool. So when his siblings would ask of his assistance with their enemies, silently hoping that the next battle he would be in would be his last, he would spite them by returning at their doorsteps with even more accolades and support from the many nobles that made up the royal court. \n\n\nEventually Oliver would get his fill of battles and ascend the throne. It was at that point that he remembered a girl from his childhood who had always beat him when it came to tests of wit and speed. \n\n\nHow could he have forgotten? Although he had bedded many women, from simple maids lusting after his muscular body, or daughters of noble houses, to even the odd princess from time to time. There was a girl whom he had met outside of palace walls on one of the days in which he disobeyed staying inside. \n\n\nHe was still weak and clueless to the world. He had ran into dirty-faced young men in the slums who saw his clothes and immediately descended on him like locusts. They punched and kicked him until he was covered in dirt, scrapes, cuts, bruises, and his own blood, which he was tasting as well. For a second, the young man thought it would be the end of his short life, until a girl around his height (slightly taller by an inch or two) would stave them off. \n\n\nOliver wanted to be as strong as her someday. No, he wanted to even be stronger. That was his thought as a child, but now, he sought after her out of a curiosity to see just what became of the girl who had saved his life. \n\n\nWas she still tomboyish? Did she move? Was she dead? \n\n\nNo. The young girl had now become a beautiful woman. She was chasing after sheep, covered in mud and dirt. But when she wasn’t doing that, she was grinding up materials for potions and magic, which was her real way of bringing in the coin.  Asking for the woman to move to his palace was met with much skepticism and lack of interest, even though she remembered the brash young boy from years prior. It wasn\u0027t until he promised her a bigger study and even workers that would do the the labor portion of the work, that she went with him. \n\n\nIt was platonic of course, but eventually they would fall madly in love with one another. However there were still things that needed to be done before they could live a life of fulfillment and enjoyment. \n\n\nAll that had to be done was rather simple: kill of all of the others who had any rights to the throne. Oliver went about doing just that. While his siblings enjoyed being in some way subtle in their ways of taking him down, all he needed to do was keep pushing forward with the might of his own forces until nothing remained.\n\n\nIt helped that he had the support of a frighteningly talented mage to support his efforts. \n",
  "page 139": "\"Sure, that doesn’t sound like a terrible thing.\" Sophia turned on a heel, jutting her index finger out to the direction of the doll holding girl. \"You must show your new creations! Even the ones that you have deemed as failures, as I will not be taking no for an answer since you\u0027ve personally requested my presence.\" \n\n\nBridgette frowned, not liking the prospect that was being proposed to her. \n\n\n\"What if I don\u0027t want to show the bad ones?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, that won\u0027t do.\" Sophia wagged her finger now, \"Part of being a good host is being accommodating to any guests that you may invite. Think of this little nugget of information as a gift that I am giving to you as the elder sister.\" \n\n\nBridgette sighed in defeat, shoulders slumping. \n\n\n\"Yes, yes, I\u0027ll gladly take in this new information from you, sister.\" She began walking off, presumably to her bed chambers. \"I\u0027ll be waiting. There are certain things that must be prepared in advance.\" \n\n\nWith the young girl making her exit, Caspar looked to Sophia. \n\n\n\"There was something I had to say, but, ah, I have an audience with your father to make.\" \n\n\n\"Is that so? Good luck.\" \n\n\n\"Phia, is that all you have to say? I might die, y\u0027know?\" \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Sophia turned and grabbed the scruff of the prince\u0027s shirt. He was taller than her, very much so, and this was a way of bringing him down to eye level. After all, when you looked down on someone in the literal sense... \"Your little pet names for me continue to shorten. Please work on fixing that.\"\n\n\nShe releases him as he laughs her off sheepishly, looking down at wrinkled garment. \n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll have to fix this first. Then, reflect on my behavior it seems.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia pokes her head into the room of Bridgette. Immediately she is greeted by the sight of many dolls meticulously lined up and positioned in a way for maximum aesthetic effectiveness. The room\u0027s color palette was a gentle lavender, from the curtains, to the rug that was beneath her shoes, and even the bed sheets. \n\n\n\"There seems to be even more from last time,\" Sophia mused out-loud, looking around for the sight of her younger sister. \n\n\n\"Inspiration isn\u0027t something that should be left lingering. My teacher told me that,\" Bridgette answered from behind. \n\n\n\"Ah!\" Sophia shouted in alarm, whirling around and stumbling backwards at the sudden shock of not expecting to hear a voice from at her back all of a sudden. \"Didn\u0027t you not say that you were going on ahead? How does the guest arrive before the host? Does such a thing not sound slightly off to you, Bridgette?\" \n\n\nThe young girl only shrugged as a reply, moving over to a small table she had situated in her room and taking a seat. \n\n\n\"How about we begin?\" She asks to her older sibling. \n\n\n\"Begin what?\" \n\n\n\"Drawing your portrait, of course. Henry is also arriving, and Fredric\u0027s preparing snacks.\" \n\n\nSophia felt a headache forming at all of this new information being revealed one after the other. If Bridgette had her own weird tendencies at times, the younger brother Henry eclipsed her in several areas. Sophia would always feel his eyes lingering on her, but he would never reply \u0027yes\u0027 to the question if there was something that he needed. Perhaps it was a shy thing? Sophia couldn’t possibly come up with an answer because she was no reader of the minds. As for Frederic Crowmane; he was the head butler of the estate, and a man who was always prim, proper, and stern in some ways. \n\n\nHow was a princess to survive such an encounter? \n",
  "page 22": "Sophia grows ever restless and agitated. It comes to a point in which she is honestly regretting her choice of even accepting the invitation. Bridgette seems to be happy with making exaggerated voices to her own dolls, engaging in conversations with her white unicorn in particular. Henry on the other hand was engrossed in the creation that he was making. Fredric, the ever diligent butler stood to the side like a statue. \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t want the cake!\" Bridgette moved her unicorn around, mimicking a man\u0027s voice. \n\n\n\"Are you sure? It\u0027s been baked quite well, Eugi!\" \n\n\nOh, so its name was Eugi. \n\n\nOkay, this was getting Sophia nowhere in her boredom. Thus she looked to Henry and smiled, which was an action that caused the hand he was using to draw to stiffen and briefly pause. \n\n\n\"Yes, big sister Sophia?\" \n\n\nSophia leaned forward, propping a hand underneath her chin as she raked her brain for an interesting topic of discussion. \n\n\n\"How have your studies been going?\" She prods her younger brother in a gentle tone. \"You\u0027re in a school for the arts, right? Oh, is me talking going to be a distraction for you?\" \n\n\n\"No, n-not at all. Your voice is pleasant to listen to actually.\" He begins drawing again. \"The studies aren\u0027t advanced, and I\u0027m quite ahead of my peers it seems. I\u0027ve overheard the teachers talking about it.\" There wasn’t a hint of arrogance, let alone pride in his own accomplishments as he revealed such things. \n\n\nSophia could only tilt her head at this. If she was him, she\u0027d be puffing her chest out. \n\n\n\"That\u0027s quite a feat, Henry! You bring much esteem to the Nevermore name!\" Sophia clapped her hands before leaning back in her seat to begin swinging her legs back and forth, in lieu of beginning to search for another possible topic to converse about. \n\n\nAh-ha! That can work \n\n\nThe always spinning mind of Sophia Nevermore found an excellent topic to grab onto. Still it would not be one without it\u0027s own awkwardness to broach and bring comfortably out into the open. But if there were no takers to start conversations of their own, then she would simply have to be the one to do it. The young princess threw a glance around to the other occupants of the room to see if there were indeed any takers. With Bridgette still engaged in her own conversation with her stuffed animal Eugi, and the ever statuesque butler continuing his endeavor of being... statuesque, she simply had no choice. \n\n\n\"Henry, have there been any girls at this school of yours that have caught your fancy?\" Sophia couldn’t help the wistful look in her eyes as she thought of her own experiences--or lack thereof-- of such a thing. \"When i was both you and Bridgette\u0027s age, I was already arranged to be engaged with Caspar at the time. So I would be curious to know.\" \n\n\nThe boy seems to be floundering for an answer, and Sophia wonders whether or not one more push would get the answer she\u0027s curious of, or should she be a good sister and have some mercy on him.\n",

  "page 0": "\"Princess Nevermore! Please, wake up, your highness!\"\n\n\nSleep is something that everyone should be allocated at their leisure. How else would anyone be beautiful? Why did it seem that most days, only she understood that very fact of being? \n\n\nIt was absolute rubbish. \n\n\nSleep was one of the few escapes of Sophia Nevermore, the princess of the Rose Kingdom. It was an absolutely romantic kingdom, known far and wide for it\u0027s beauty and smell of flowers-- roses in particular. And being princess, the eighteenth out of twenty-five left her no leisure for free time, and most importantly her sleep.\n\n\nThere were so few people that Princess Nevermore would let get away with doing something that irritated her. It just so happened to be the person that was being quite irritating  at the moment was none other than her attendant since childhood, Juliette Forthwight. Whom was a fancy enough girl, coming from a family of former nobility, that now found themselves at the behest of the Nevermore family. It truly was an esteemed role befitting of a family that possessed such a fine pedigree. Truly she could search far and wide, however it would be nigh impossible to find anyone more loyal and... attentive, to say the least. Sophia was unsure at times on whether or not it was a blessing or a curse. \n\n\nAlthough they of course paled in comparison to the magnificence of the Nevermore’s. Not all man were created equal, as surely made by the design of the gods themselves. \n\n\n\"..What? What is your intention of waking me from my wonderful slumber, Juliette?\" Sophia mutters out, casting a drowsy glare. \n\n\nFor her part, Juliette looks apologetic on her behalf. The young women wants to apologize, but still she had her duty to do. It just so happened that today was momentous in comparison to other days.\n\n\n\"Forgive me, your highness, but today you are to meet your betrothed, Prince Caspar!\" It almost brought tears to her eyes when she completed that statement, but she was a faithful attendant to the Nevermore family, so she kept composure. However to her chagrin and pride, she just couldn’t stop the slight rise of jubilation in her voice. The girl she has always watched and cared for in a sense--despite how close they were in age, growing up and experiencing similar things and education, was to be married to quite a well off family. The union of Nevermore and Branch was surely to be quite rich in gain for both families. No doubt Sophia was enjoying living up to her own duty that was bestowed upon to her by her father. \n\n\nBut she was frowning, the princess was marred with an expression that seemed anything but excited for the eventual moment of having her hand taken in marriage by such a handsome prince with such an esteemed family name. If the princess was upset, she was of course upset as well on her behalf. \n\n\n\"Is everything well with you, your highness?\" Juliette asks. \n\n\n\"No, everything isn\u0027t well, and I am not well,\" Sophia answers her attendant, fully turning to face the other young woman with her dreary expression. The drowsiness from her sleep was also giving benefits in making the princess look quite like the pitiful character of a storybook. \n\n\nImmediately Juliette flung to settle herself near the side of the princess, bringing her hands to settle over the other woman\u0027s own. It wasn\u0027t an action that didn\u0027t have a set precedent. As the person that was often closet to the princess, she often played sole audience to the woman\u0027s plights, insecurities, and fears. While Sophia cast an image of an unflappable maiden to people in public, this certainly wasn\u0027t the case behind the veil of her character. Being a person that could be confided in such a level was an esteemed honor that Juliette Forthwight treasured with her being. \n\n\n\"Why is that the case, your highness?\" \n\n\n\"It\u0027s because... I have come to realize that I cannot make any true decisions of my own. Everything is always decided for me, Juliette. What I should be wearing for the day, what I am to eat, and now, who I should be betrothed  for the entirety of my mortal life. It is all quite so tiresome, I must admit. While I\u0027m aware there\u0027s plenty of people who would readily trade their lives for mine, in some small way, I would do the same. Just so I could experience a life of my own choices.\" \n\n\nJuliette blinked. She then blinked again, at a true loss of words in her stunned silence. \n\n\nShe never knew her highness was suffering from such emotional ails. How could she have possibly been ignorant of the fact? It was almost a large enough grievance for the attendant to question her very being. Was there any more large of a slight of not being able to pick up the clear signs of the princess\u0027s suffering? \n\n\n\"Your highness, perhaps we should discuss this over your bath?\" \n",

The woman died when she was quite young, and barely able to perceive and understand why her mother suddenly went took a nap one day, and then subsequently never woke up again.

She was a young woman who was not born of any rich and prestigious bloodline, but a family who worked hard to earn their keep, and the meals in their stomachs. \n\n\nGrace always had an interest in magic, and even as a child, she was able to play several tricks on most by manipulating the very wind itself.

Sophia and Juliette have no success in the capital of finding anyone that is even wandering the street that can lend an ear to listen to their plight.

I\u0027ve never been to these parts of the kingdom!\" Sophia exclaims excitedly, finding a large open space that seems perfect. \n\n\nJuliette continues to allow her eyes to flicker back and forth around their environment. She takes note of some of the stares of disdain and scorn that are being thrown their way. \n\n\n\"There is certainly a sense of danger, your highness.\" \n\n\nSophia only hums in response, finding a stray wooden box to pull to the center of the area. \n\n\n\"Hear me, citizens of Rose Kingdom!\"\n\n\nSophia shouts loudly, garnering some curious stares that stop what they are doing and linger about to find out what the young woman has to say further.  \n\n\n\"I, a lady of nobility ask that you all take up arms for the good of you all!\" \n\n\n--x\n\n\nUpon admittance of nobility, this doesn\u0027t go over well.\n\n\nThe slow-feeding ire of the crowd is not easy to quell.\n\n\nSeeing their robes, their out of place demeanor, the crowd has no mere bemusement over their presence.\n\n\nA rock thrown with enough force is terrifying in its own right, and it is the fate of the attendant who rushes in and tries to smooth things over. \n\n\nWhat happens next is truly the result of hubris, the princess is dragged from her cart and pulled apart.\n\n\nHer hair is tugged, clothing pulled, and whatever trinkets on her person, shatter on the stone cobble. \n\n\nWhat\u0027s next to shatter is her skull as it’s eventually bludgeoned and beaten in. \n\n\nThe only small comfort is that her body drops besides her close friend in her final miserable seconds. \n\n\nIt\u0027s a miserable end for a foolish princess.\n\n\nBut some would call it fitting.\n\n\nWould you agree, or disagree? \n",
  "page 32": "\"Perhaps we should employ wizards!\" Sophia suggests to her attendant, who looks to seriously regard the decision.\n\n\nJuliette makes her calculations in her mind. \"Well, we could maybe afford two.

I think this is the choice that we should go with, Juliette.\" Sophia was growing a bit excited at seeing whomever they would hire in action now. Maybe she could even learn a few things? There was no way that she was one that so untalented that she couldn’t possibly have to potential to do such a thing herself. \n\n\nPerhaps after all of this was done, she\u0027d be able ask for a lesson or two herself. \n\n\n---\n\n\n\"Mira and Mako?\" Juliette asks, regarding the two eager eyed magicians that stared across the table at herself and the princess. It certainly made her work easier that the brother and sister duo came equipped with a sheet of paper that listed all of the two spells that the both of them could do, and one combination technique.\n\n\nIt looked like they would still have to hire a few more men, with whatever would be left from their purses.\n\n\n\"Yes! We\u0027re both eager to make a name for ourselves! Our magic will go down in history, and we\u0027ll be etched in the history books like the great wizard Milano!\" The brother, Mako speaks first. \n\n\nMira nods her head, her knee rising up and down and shaking the table with each motion. \"It\u0027s as my brother says! You two seem like royalty, and mother always says it\u0027s best to get up on the ground floor when it comes to these things. Battles like these, when the odds are stacked, that is only when it is worth doing magic.\"\n\n\nJuliette silently sends a look, Sophia\u0027s way. It asks: \u0027Are you sure about this?\u0027\n\n\nSophia is swept up by the pair\u0027s enthusiasm, smiling along. They both seemed so passionate, and that was just what she needed to feel more confident in what it was they were doing. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re hired! Once we get more men ready, we\u0027ll want you to meet with us!\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nIt\u0027s a disaster at the first moment the wizards are let onto the battlefield. The mercenaries that they were able to hire are also not of the best quality. Some of them have more desperation than bravado, as their armor is cheap in the areas in which they actually have armor. Mira and Mako do a decent enough job in keeping the moral high, but it\u0027s more through amusement than any inspiring comments that the two make.\n\n\nWhen all of them stand outside the castle, it\u0027s when they\u0027re finally unable to hide their excitement any longer.\n\n\n\"So, I\u0027m thinking we all snea--\" One of the mercenary\u0027s was in the process of saying, before his speech is stolen from in his shock as the two mages begin walking ahead.\n\n\nSophia is almost at a loss of words her own self. \n",

Whether or not some considered her royalty or not, that wouldn\u0027t be in doubt no more once the events of today will transpire. Her eyes were seeing victory, despite any of the odds that could not yet be seen by her.\n\n\n\"Go on,\" Paul leaned back in the chair he was occupying. \n\n\n\"My sisters, like me, are what I would not refer to as morning maidens. I\u0027m sure that even now, they\u0027re throwing their vulgar parties, thinking that my capture will be easy. I doubt that they think that I could possibly come to them instead.\" \n\n\n\"And where are you going with this?\" Paul questions along. \n\n\nSophia smiles, thinking that she\u0027s possibly come up with the greatest idea. \"We\u0027ll attack them now.\" \n\n\n\"Umm, now?\" Juliette tilts her head.\n\n\n\"Yes, now.\"\n\n\n\"Now, as in right this moment now?\" \n\n\n\"Ummm, yes...?\" \n\n\nPaul sighs, slumps his shoulders, realizes he stood up upon hearing his current employer\u0027s plan, before allowing himself to fall carelessly back down in his seat, once again taking another swig from his flask. \n\n\nSophia immediately frowned at this sight, placing both of her hands on her hips as she regarded the older individual. \n\n\n\"Is there something wrong with what I\u0027m saying? If it is indeed so, please enlighten me to the specifics of any wrongs that you may see with this plan of mine.\" \n\n\nPaul rubbed at the stubble on his chin, having to make himself remember that he had to be respectful and polite in some manner. \n\n\n\"Well, what makes this other group of swords different than our own? Hell, that might have more of an advantage because there is there lodgings that we\u0027re attacking. We might find ourselves staring down fireballs, or chased by many manner of creature. You see where I\u0027m going with this, right?\" \n\n\nSophia for her part could only stare in a manner of disbelief. \n\n\n\"So much reservations, do you have any other plan?\" \n\n\n\"Give me a night, and I can think of on--\"\n\n\n\"Sorry, may I but in?\" Juliette spoke up, hand raised, and upon receiving nods of affirmation from both parties she spoke. \"I think there might be merits in attacking now. But, I do implore that we move on the side of caution and try our best in not being detected until we\u0027re able to breach castle grounds.\" \n\n\nPaul swept a tongue across hus teeth, arms crossing. \n\n\n\"So now we\u0027re also sneaking? I prefer more direct approaches, and so do many of my men as well.\" \n\n\nSophia blinked, and then shrugged. \n\n\n\"Then train them and yourself to practice restraint. It\u0027s simple, no? Learning a new thing.\" \n\n\nPaul was now the one looking at both of the women before him with a look of disbelief. For women that supposedly grew up in a palace, they were odd ones. But then again, there were many odd eccentric nobles that he had met in his lifetime. \n\n\n\"Fine, damn it. I\u0027ll get my men ready for an early assault.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\nWith an early advantage given to Sophia\u0027s group, there\u0027s plenty of more dead men of her sister than hers. Still, she\u0027s in the thick of things, despite Juliette\u0027s insistence that she\u0027d be anywhere else but the battlefield. If the other woman had it her way, she would be in another kingdom entirely, rather than witnessing all of the blood being spilled on her behalf. \n\n\nShe wished for thus, and so, it was happening. \n\n\nIf things didn\u0027t have to reach this point, Sophia would have been more than happy. \n\n\nAlthough their earlier advantage had led to them Paul\u0027s mercenaries being able to quite literally kill their enemies while they were unaware, or even before some had time to put on their armor, however with the enemy\u0027s assistance of magical items, the battle was becoming a more even affair. \n\n\nMagic swords that can create a mini blizzard, or a tornado of flames. All of this would be such a marvel and treat to the ideas if the results and the aftermath of the bodies that met these weapons weren’t so... harrowing. \n\n\n\"So this is what a battle is like,\" Sophia mused out-loud, to nobody in particular. \n\n\nThere was nobody besides her at the moment. \n\n\nApparently her sisters had employed a few mages despite their high price (information given to Sophia by Paul) so even if they were to manage a victory on this day, there probably wouldn\u0027t be much in terms of silver and gold for them to all benefit from. \n\n\nAll it had taken was one giant boulder of rock being formed into existence by two hooded figure to break the main formation of Sophia, Juliette, and the mercenary captain, Paul. There was a slight shiver that of course ran down her spine, but it was a feeling that needed to be shaken off if she were to survive. \n\n\nThere were footsteps now approaching, and as Sophia whirled her head around, she saw only two available paths for her to take. \n\n\nOnce again, things were do or die for the young conquering princess.\n",
  "page 34": "It\u0027s at the wee hours of the morning that Sophia and Juliette are woken up out of their slumber by the clanging of metal and steel. Both women exchange confused glances, but ultimately it is Juliette that rises from the bed first. She was used to waking up early after all to make her preparations in being a proper attendant to her highness. A change of scenery or even sound in this instance, wouldn\u0027t do much to impede on her internal clock. \n\n\n\"..A-are we being attacked? Did we.. choose the wrong band of rogues?\" Sophia questioned tiredly, barely coming out of her sleep as it was. She was used to sleeping in for all manner of hours if she could get away with it. \n\n\nJuliette only would shake her head at the question with a knowing smile fixed on her face. \n\n\n\"No, I don\u0027t believe that to be the case, your highness. However, perhaps we should get up and see what it\u0027s about?\" \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t wanna.\"\n\n\n\"Ah, but we must, don\u0027t you think so?\" \n\n\n\"Gimme another five minutes, please.\" \n\n\nBefore any potential statement on the contrary of her being able to lay back in the bed without a care, Sophia Nevermore grabbed two pillows and sunk back in the sheets, trying not to let the piercing cacophony impede on her valuable beauty rest.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\"Is the little princess still not awake yet? Time is money for us sell-swords, if you weren\u0027t aware, missus.\"\n\n\n\"Missus?\" Juliette quirked an eyebrow, but nevertheless fished for an appropriate statement. \"Her highness has told me that she wants to get changed alone.\" \n\n\nWith that reply, the conversation between Juliette, the ever faithful attendant, and Paul Kirsch, the alcoholic of a mercenary, any talking briefly stalled. The silence between the two was not an awkward one by any means, with Juliette being more than happy to drink in this new \u0027rough and tough\u0027 environment, and Paul being able to take a more sizable gulp from his flask with this lull. \n\n\n\"Urgh, I\u0027m used to more than just bread for the morning. I hope you\u0027re aware of that, sir.\"\n\n\nSophia finally made her grand entrance, heading down the stairs into the main room of the building that the mercenaries chose for their temporary headquarters. The young princess was still wrapping her mind around all of the recent happenings to say the least. It was only a week prior ago that the only thing she had to worry about were her sisters incessant rude behavior whenever she so happened to cross their paths upon exiting her room.\n\n\nNow she had to worry about her sister\u0027s incessant rude behavior when it came to her being able to breathe of her own volition.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re late. Do you blue-blooded types always take your time like this? You notice that all of men are already up and about, getting ready for this skirmish of ours. Some of them won\u0027t return alive, so they’re taking in every second as much as they can.\" \n\n\nSophia visibly sighed, thinking how this was certainly going to be a long ordeal. \n\n\n\"Of course, but first we need a plan of action, right?\"\n",
  "page 37": "Sophia moves through the foyer, not liking the feeling the other choice placed in her stomach. There was no way she could even fathom hiding amongst the dead that was on the ground. The moment that she would begin making choices like that, it was also the moment in which she would have to start questioning her own humanity. \n\n\n\"I can\u0027t believe that I ended up alone, though.\" She mused. \n\n\nThe princess takes tentative steps forward, not enjoying the sounds of how her own footsteps echoed. People were dying below her, and yet, such a thing did not feel real when it was so eerily quiet. \n\n\n---x\n\n\nHow unaware she was, of how anything truly worked. \n\n\nThe young princess wanders right into the path of a wizard who stood watching her above. \n\n\nHe\u0027s silent in his incantation, but he casts a haze of confusion. \n\n\nShe wanders into her sister\u0027s clutches and is taken hostage. \n\n\nThe things done to her are better left unsaid.\n\n\nBut ah, she\u0027s kept in chains, enslaved. \n\n\nIt is said that the two sisters now keep a very happy army of men. Their favorite place to visit seems to be a particular room in the underground cell.\n\n\nAfter she becomes too pitiful to look at, ever the gracious winners, Cecilene and Aline Nevermore ultimately have her mind completely and utterly done away with. \n\n\nIt\u0027s an act that ultimately kills the poor thing. \n\n\nSome would call it fitting for a foolish princess.\n\n\nWhat says you on the matter?\n",
  "page 36": "It\u0027s decided amongst the mercenaries that their plan is to assault the castle under the dead of night. Sophia is more than happy to leave all of the planning to those with more experience than herself when it comes to such matters. If all she had to do was sit back and not have to lift a weapon to see both of her sisters shocked faces when she arrived at their castle with men of her own, then all of the money spent on said men would be worth it.\n\n\nSo time passes, and much of it is spent going through formations for Paul and his men. Sophia\u0027s never personally met or seen mercenaries in action, but to her, it looks as if these men are of a higher tier than any run of the mill mercenary group.\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt\u0027s nightfall when the first body is torn open with the steel of a sword. The element of surprise gives them advantage over the soldiers who weren’t expecting a group of men to attack them in the dead of night with reckless abandon. \n\n\n\"My, this is so much more gruesome than reading it from any book, or seeing it in a play.\" \n\n\nSophia mused to herself, maneuvering slightly maneuvering so she doesn’t disrespectfully allow herself to step over a corpse of one of her solider\u0027s, or that of an enemy.\n\n\n\"Wait? What\u0027s that? Are those tiny men? They seem to be charging our direction.\" Juliette points out through the sound of clashing steel and shouts that ring out across the area. \"Glowing eyes? Your highness! Ru--\"\n\n\n--x\n\n\nDozens of flashing red eyes is all Sophia Nevermore and her group of hired men sees\n\n\nThat is until they feel the biting, tearing, and gnawing of their flesh. \n\n\nIt\u0027s not their fellow man that seals their fate\n\n\nBut the bite, and the hunger of the night Gnomes\n\n\nLimbs are torn off, throats are ripped out, and the screams ring out through the night.\n\n\nBeing eaten alive is certainly a feeling that no human should go through\n\n\nThose are the last thoughts of the princess before her throat is ripped open. \n\n\nIt\u0027s a fool’s end for a foolish princess\n\n\nHowever, it\u0027s not one that has to be set in stone. Unless you want it to be, that is. \n",
  "page 39": "Sophia Nevermore allows the knife to fall to her side. It\u0027s true that she doesn\u0027t want to have to kill yet another sister. The sickening feeling she had gotten from murdering Cecilene is still very much present. Maybe things were not yet too far gone for the pair of sisters, even as drenched in blood as they were at this point. So the instrument that she had used, clatters carelessly on the floor beneath her feet, behind her back, out of sight, and out of her mind for the time being. \n\n\n\"I-I\u0027m sorry,\" Sophia stammers out, the guilt weighing down on both her conscience and heart. It was as if both things were two separate entities, but both were equal in measure in causing her current moral dilemma. \n\n\n--x\n\n\nThe princess is too benevolent in her victory, blind to the sight of grasping hands that search for the bloodied knife. \n\n\nIn a world as cruel as this, one shouldn’t be too gracious when there is no benefit to be seen.\n\n\n\"You foolish cur!\" \n\n\nIt\u0027s the last thing that Sophia Nevermore hears as a knife is plunged into her back.\n\n\nIt comes again, and, again...\n\n\nThe information as to when her sister stops isn\u0027t known to her\n\n\nAs her life ebbs out at the fifth plunge of the blade through the back, and plunging into her heart. \n\n\nTruly, one could say it is a foolish ending befitting the foolish princess of this story. \n\n\nBut is it one that is agreeable to you, whom who partakes in said story?\n",
  "page 38": "It\u0027s an absolute abhorrent thing that she was about to do, but with survival on the mind, Sophia Nevermore figured that she would get over it if she had to. Better an upset stomach, and a bad night of sleep or two from nightmares, than dying a painful and humiliating death. Yes, she would take the former any day over dying. There were still things that she had to do, things she still had to figure out, like why she was even fighting her two sisters to the death to begin with. \n\n\nThis wasn\u0027t like any of their previous fights, with the hair being tugged, and a slap or two. \n\n\nLives, theirs were in each other\u0027s hands. That was a fact as Sophia buried herself under the corpses of men, her hand feeling wet silver. There\u0027s a grimace that she really wants to make, and an uncomfortable sound or two, but she holds her breath. \n\n\n---\n\n\nELSEWHERE \n\n\n\"Say hello to the reaper when you see \u0027im, fucker!\" \n\n\nPaul remarked as he tore his broadsword through another dying man, not even sparing another glance at the falling corpse as another enemy had knocked against him with the full force of their weight, weapon, and will to continue to survive.\"\n\n\nWell unfortunately for him, his own will to live was just a little bit stronger.\n\n\n\"Gods, bestow to me the elements of the world, and spark!\" \n\n\nWith his incantation done, with a snap of one of his fingers that was holding his sword, he shot forth a great burst of flames directly at the man who was facing him, melting his face. The smell of burning flesh was always something that made his nose crinkle just a bit, but he doesn’t waste his time in driving his sword through the other man, covering his sword in even more blood of his enemies. It really was just business after all, so he had to be efficient. \n\n\n\"Sir, look out, behind you!\" \n\n\nIt\u0027s the sound of, what was it again? Judyette\u0027s (incorrect) voice that brings him to toss a look at his blindside. True as the little attendant says, there\u0027s a mage looking to cast a spell at his direction. From the looks of it, it\u0027s another earth spell that tosses yet another unreasonably large rock at their direction.\n\n\n\"Oi, oi, oi! Give me a damn break, will ya!?\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s not enough time for any fancy evasive maneuvers, so Paul braces himself for an attack that doesn’t ever come, as an arrow sails through in the air, as if carried by the wind spirits themselves. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re too damn bloodthirsty. What if I weren’t here to save you, old man?\" \n\n\nA green hooded figure asks, reaching for the hood that was fastened on their heads to show platinum hair and pointed ears. Green eyes also staring oppressively at the battlefield, and also their latest handiwork. It took one out of three favors that she could use for that arrow to fly true and pierce the eye of that would-be mage\u0027s. \n\n\n\"Evie! It\u0027s just that I know I can count on your sharpshooting to pull my arse out of the jaws of death! Hahahaha!\" \n\n\nJuliette looked utterly baffled that the man could still keep his sense of humor, even after such an event. As the attendant looked down at herself, she saw no wounds that required immediate care, but she certainly was feeling the strain and stress. But she had to be strong, despite her worry. \n\n\n\"We still have to find her! We must!\" \n\n\nEvie narrowed her eyes at the women’s insistence, and was one step away from opening her mouth to say something snidely before she heard the boisterous voice of her captain fill the air. \n\n\n\"Missy, I hate to break it you, but we\u0027re surrounded our own selves. We\u0027ll just have to have faith that our princess can survive on her own for a moment. I did send some of what\u0027s left of my men after her, so she shouldn’t be alone too long.\" \n\n\nJuliette\u0027s worries aren\u0027t remedied in the slightest, but she nods her head anyway in order to be respectful. She did see the kindness in was doing, straying thoughts like hers would lead to her being killed, she knew that. However, how would she even be able to continue if something were to happen to her highness? \n\n\nShe could only pray for her safety.\n\n\n---\n\n\nOutside of the Palace Room \n\n\nThe doors burst open, and two similar faced looking young women run out. Both their state of dress shows the story of both frenzied alarm, and being taken by surprise. Something that also lurks in their eyes is the ever unmistakable sign of... fear? Although Sophia was looking up at them currently, the position wouldn’t be one that would last long. \n\n\n\"That little! I have to say, I didn\u0027t expect that she would have all of this in her!\" Cecilene spoke first out of the twins.\n\n\n\"We just need to escape, that is all! Then we\u0027ll rebuild our forces and kill her.\"\n\n\n\"I want her suffering to be a slow one.\"\n\n\n\"Of cours-- Aghhhh!\"\n\n\nCecilene is quickly brought down to her knees, shaking in both shock and pain. A bloodied knife is sunk deep into the flesh of her leg, before it is an action that is repeated once more in quick succession. \n\n\n\"S-Sister, h-help mmmgth!?\" \n\n\nA hand is covered over her mouth, and a body covered in blood rises from the corpses. This of course only belongs to one individual, one fair princess of the Rose Kingdom. The one that brought into fruition this down, but she was only retailing, let\u0027s not let that fact slip. There\u0027s a look of trepidation and despise that is tossed this woman\u0027s way. \n\n\n\"S-Sophia, what are you doing to our sister? D-Don\u0027t you think things have gone too far as it is. We\u0027ve only wanted sent those men after you for your safety! I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard of the crazy state of affairs of our kingdom. It\u0027s making us mad!\"\n\n\nFor a moment, Sophia seriously considers her sister\u0027s words.\n\n\nBut only for a moment, before she slits her own sister\u0027s throat. Her blood sails through the air, it flies, and it splatters across her face. The blood-covered princess can only bring a single digit of her fingers to wipe it away. \n\n\nWho would have thought that the first person she would kill will be her own sister? The thought makes her stomach want to churn, and she wants to spew out the morning\u0027s stale bread right on the floor. But standing across from her is an enemy. Although the same blood they shared, their ideologies were different. \n\n\nSophia Nevermore drops Cecilene Nevermore\u0027s dead body on the ground. \n\n\nAline squeals and quickly assumes a position of fealty. She doesn\u0027t even bother to show remorse or concern for her sister that was just murdered before her eyes. Sophia cannot find herself blaming his sister too much for that. Death was imminent and others would often think of themselves first. \n\n\n\"Why did father have to die?\"\n\n\n\"I-I don\u0027t know, I swear it!\"\n\n\n\"Why did you attack me?\"\n\n\n\"I-I don\u0027t kno--\"\n\n\nSophia quickly storms over to her Aline\u0027s groveling body and places her heel ontop of the woman\u0027s head, which digs her face uncomfortably to the ground. The woman struggles to get proper air and even taps at Sophia\u0027s foot in an act of submission, to get some reprieve from the pressure she is giving out.\n\n\n\"Answer again, but honestly, please, s-sister. I just want to know, so that I won\u0027t kill you.\" \n\n\nWith the opportunity of being spared being presented, Aline corrects her posture, positions herself on the ground that is in a way more appealing to having her wish of survival granted. \n\n\n\"The reason why both me and Cecilene treated you in such ways, it\u0027s... it was because you were father\u0027s favorite.\"\n\n\nSophia couldn\u0027t believe what she was hearing out of the mouth of her sister. It all sounded ridiculous. Just how was she the favorite in any conceivable way? \n\n\n\"I could seldom leave the palace, and yet I am the favorite? Can you not come up with a more unbelievable idea?\"\n\n\n\"B-But it is indeed so! Father wanted you protected, and locked away. Locked away from any of the responsibilities that came with running a kingdom such as ours.\" Bitterness starts steeping through Aline\u0027s voice. \"You may not know it, but me and our sister, we would have to do certain things to keep father\u0027s investors and retainers happy. You\u0027re not so innocent that you don\u0027t know what those things were, yes?\"\n\n\nThat urge of spewing rear its head again, and Sophia has to fight to keep the bile down, but nevertheless, Aline continued. \n\n\n\"When we saw how little of anything you knew about the outside, how you could be the way you were... we grew to be envious, but it wasn\u0027t you that we should have been envious of, but our father! This world, this kingdom, none of is worth the pain. But even so, I want to live, please! Spare me!\" \n\n\nSophia took a step backwards, the grip of her knife loosening as she teetered on the choice to make. There was a big part of her that didn\u0027t want to kill another sibling, but she also had to protect her own life. \n\n\nJust what was the right decision? \n",
  "page 31": "It\u0027s decided by the two girls that going with sellswords is the best choice of action. The reason being that their lack of loyalty to any specific group or king would make them ideal in a situation such as theirs. What better way to deal with the mercenaries that were after them, than with facing them with mercenaries of their own? \n\n\nHowever, it would take bleeding dry all of their available purses to do so. \n\n\nWhat\u0027s also decided is that both Juliette and Sophia would procure these new troops together. Thus with traveling cloaks on, the two noblewomen disperse from the wilderness that they were in at the first fall of the sun. \n\n\nAfter an hour or two of asking around for where the local militias are located, the two noblewomen find themselves in the dregs of the town. People are starving, some people look mean, and ready to kill with a glance. It\u0027s all sobering for Sophia, who at this point never traveled to such places before. Her routes were usually in the upper parts of the kingdom, where the royal guards were around every corner to stop the rare crime. But now with a dead king, and splintered off nobles fighting for the right to claim themselves as the king, most places were beginning to look like the lower areas of the kingdom.\n\n\n\"This is so unbecoming,\" \n\n\n\"Hmm? What do you mean, your highness?\" \n\n\n\"Is this really the Rose Kingdom? It doesn\u0027t even smell like rose petals are around every corner, and if they are, they\u0027re clearly withering away.\" \n\n\n\"Well, you can say that the wealth isn\u0027t equally distributed.\"\n\n\nIt was an understatement. If the young princess had only known, if she wasn\u0027t blind in her ignorance, she wouldn’t want to see such a wide disparity of quality when it came to compare parts of the kingdom to each other. No, it wasn\u0027t a moral thing, not at all. It was just displeasing to the eye in an aesthetic sense.\n\n\nRegardless of feelings, both Sophia and Juliette would soon be audience of a bunch of men drinking their merry fill of liquor. But at the sight of the two women, some of them sobered up, and one man in particular was soon staring them down. \n\n\n\"You girls the entertainment? I must say that I prefer more meat on my women, but you\u0027ll both do.\" \n\n\nThe first thing that either of them notice is the absolute stench of liquor on his breath. The mercenary is clearly inebriated on some level. Especially so if he was confusing two women of respectable pedigree with common floozies that could be bought with cheap prices. It was both insulting and infuriating to Sophia, and she would have made known her displeasure if Juliette didn\u0027t carefully watch her and decide to quickly swoop in and begin speaking on the behest of them both.\n\n\n\"Actually, we\u0027re hoping we can inquire on the fee of your services. I\u0027m Juliette, and can I have your name?\" \n\n\n\"Paul.\" The man answered in a matter of fact tone. The prospect of work sobering him up a bit. \n\n\n\"Well Paul, we need some assistance with a rather serious matter.\"\n\n\n\"Can you cut to the point, missy?\" \n\n\n\"We\u0027re having trouble with two associates with ours, the highnesses, Aline and Ceceline.\" \n\n\nPaul regards Juliette as if she just told him that the sky was raining candy. In an act of brutishness, he begins to dig his finger in his air, grimacing at what comes out of said ear before flicking it off to the side. His eyes are then to the neighboring men that were near him, who all nod in his silent question on whether or not what he heard was indeed correct. \n\n\n\"Wait, hold on there, missy. You\u0027re basically telling us to attack royalty! We\u0027re traveling nomads, you see! Right now the kingdom is in a bit of a disarray because there\u0027s, well, no king to lead it, but afterwards? You\u0027re telling us to put that many eyes on us?\" \n\n\nPaul\u0027s man look on, nodding their heads in agreement, and Juliette looks like she\u0027s losing ground.\n\n\n\"Of course we\u0027ll pay you handsomely for the troub--\" \n\n\n\"Yeah, of course you were going to pay us to begin with, right? You girls didn\u0027t come here looking for charity, did you!?\" The mercenary captain\u0027s comments sets off a chorus of laughter from his men, which he of course is in the process of doing himself; laughing. \n\n\nSophia Nevermore on the other-hand had heard enough, as she reveals her prized brooch. \n\n\nInstantly she\u0027s met with a stunned silence. \n\n\nThe brooch glistens brightly in the low-light building that housed the mercenaries. It was a sign of her nobility, and an important keepsake from her late mother who had departed from this world. Once again, the woman who could no longer speak words to her was still providing a great assistance to her even from beyond her own noble grave. \n\n\n\"I, Sophia Nevermore, demand you all shut up and listen! We are no mere women. I have the power to instill you all with knighthood! Aren\u0027t you all tired of not having a true home to rest your heads, being simple travelers to die at any lord\u0027s command with nothing in return!? We don\u0027t have much in terms of money to offer you now, but our enemies are in no doubt a comfortable cozy castle that we can steal for ourselves! So, what say you?\" \n\n\nTears well in Juliette\u0027s eyes, but she quickly wipes them away with her sleeve. What was this feeling? Proudness? \n\n\nPaul on the other hand still looks like he wants to be further convinced, but one gaze casted on his fellow men who were now completely sobered up by the offer on the table that were offered to them, told him all that he needed to know. This was a bit of a proposition that many of his many would possibly begrudge him. \n\n\nBut he finally relents with a slumping of his shoulders. \n\n\n\"Damn it, fine! But any plans go through me, but your suggestions will heavily be factored in. There\u0027s much preparations to be made, now that we\u0027re attacking a castle and all. Gonna need a plan and all, you do know that, right, princess?\"\n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia and Juliette now sat in one of the furnished bed rooms of the rented out building of Paul\u0027s mercenaries. They each are silent as they plop down on the same bed instinctively. \n\n\n\"A-Ah! I\u0027m sorry, your highness! I\u0027ll get up n-no--\"\n\n\nThe princess quickly grabs her hand, stopping the other woman from getting up out of the bed and leaving. It\u0027s only through this action that the attendant notices just how much her highness is shaking. \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t you even dare, Julienne!\" Sophia hisses, burying her face into the woman\u0027s shoulder. I truly thought my heart would leap from my chest, hit the wall, and then splatter on the ground. For that reason, you\u0027re staying with me here tonight, or at least until my hearts calms down with its incessant beating out of my chest, understand?\" \n\n\n\"Yes, anything you require.\" \n\n\nSophia Nevermore\u0027s heart did calm down, but her hold on Juliette was not something that was easily relinquished. And so, the night continued downstairs, while the two woman soon found themselves slumbering. \n\n\nAt least until the dawn of a new day. \n",
  "page 30": "Camping, making camp, this is what they called what Sophia and Juliette were doing. \n\n\nBoth women would no doubt be more excited if there weren\u0027t a multitude of men out to get them at the behest of Sophia\u0027s sisters, Aline, and Ceciline. For all intents and purposes, they were in a much better state of being than the both of them. No doubt they had their own castle to fire off such orders as having Sophia captured, and of course having able bodied individuals to carry out and bring these orders into being. \n\n\nNow Sophia Nevermore and Juliette, chased out from their lodgings, were now in hiding in a wilderness. It really was only a matter of time before the enemies would start picking up on any trails left behind, so they didn\u0027t have a wealth of time of doing anything besides making a modest fire and eating the last of their provisions which consisted of bread that was now stale.\n\n\nIt\u0027s been even more days since Sophia\u0027s father been killed by someone from her family. \n\n\nShe didn’t want to believe it, but it was now a certain reality. \n\n\nThere was no further persons in her bloodline to turn to. If she was to even turn in the direction of her family, she would now have to be prepared to defend her life. \n\n\n\"We need men of our own,\" Sophia spoke out-loud, feeding a small piece of wood to further feed their flame.\n\n\n\"Remember, not too much, your highness. We\u0027re in hiding from some rather dangerous people from the sounds of it.\" Juliette hugged her knees, her face pondering. \"Yes, for protection, that would be nice.\" \n\n\n\"Yes, we have to pay those twins a visit.\" \n\n\n\"Come again?\" \n\n\n\"Juliette, how long will we run for our lives? What\u0027s next for us? Do we allow ourselves to be chased to the point in which we\u0027re living in holes on the ground, only coming up to eat worms? I say that we should repay my sisters kindness and hospitality. They\u0027ve sent such unsavory men after us, so I do feel it is only right.\" \n\n\nFor her part, Juliette looked hesitant with the proceedings of this conversation, before Sophia covered both of her hands with her own, and looked into her eyes with the greatest amount of honesty she felt that an individual could muster. \n\n\n\"I can\u0027t do this alone, as you may already know. So, will you help me as you always have thus far?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, of course, your highness.\" \n\n\nWith that affirmation, the two woman would conspire in that wilderness for potential allies to recruit to their banner. \n",
  "page 44": "Sophia stops at the entryway of the barracks, lingering for a moment before the self doubt begins to cloud any further steps from her. What did she honestly know about tactics? Even the battle many months prior was a desperate one that was barely won. Things were at best, very tentative. Would it be smart to potentially drive away a new ally? \n\n\nThis inactivity, it ate at her being too. She didn\u0027t enjoy seeing innocent lives which had nothing to do with the conflict, being snuffed out by whichever foes they\u0027ve had that chose to remain hidden. \n\n\n\"Your highness?\" The solider questions the young woman, who only begins walking back the way in which she came. \n\n\n\"If Roy\u0027s able to find and bring to justice whoever is responsible for all of these deaths, then I would be happy as well.\" Sophia stopped at the long stairs that led up to her study. \"Feel free to support him as best you can if you wish to do so.\" \n\n\nWith those words, the princess of the castle retreated out of sight. \n\n\n--x\n\n\nThe bodies never do stop piling up\n\n\nMany call into question their \"leader\u0027s\" ability to actually lead. \n\n\nCivilians and knights alike are found dead every morning.\n\n\nSoon the people begin to act quite strange, a farmer killing a tailor.\n\n\nA single solider going mad and attacking what is supposed to be his fellow comrade. Two soldiers suddenly going mad, and then a third. It soon becomes bad enough that the princess locks herself in her room, never to leave. \n\n\nRoy, the young hotheaded mage never does return. \n\n\nThe princess however meets her demise as the hands of her trusted attendant. \n\n\nThe attendant seems almost giddy as she stabs the princess, burying the knife deeply into the woman\u0027s gut, who weakened from hunger doesn\u0027t do much besides die quite pathetically. \n\n\nSome would say it\u0027s a fitting end for a foolish princess, but what say you on that matter? \n",
  "page 46": "This entire situation was already unnerving as it could possibly be. Sophia Nevermore found herself not wanting to deal with these weird children anymore than she had to. \n\n\n\"Well then, if you take a right, and then continue straight, you\u0027ll find a road to that will lead you to dwellings of the ones in charge of message delivery. I already have just so much that comes my way. Be good little boys and girls and share that cake with the hardworking individuals that are there, okay?\" \n\n\nSophia then moved to close the door in the face of the children. Pressing her back against it and allowing herself to take a sigh of relief. She certainly hoped that she wouldn’t have to deal with them knocking aga--\n\n\n\"This is a very bad mistake that you\u0027re making, princess.\"\n\n\n--x\n\n\nA knife pierces through the wood, going directly through the heart. \n\n\nThe princess doubles over, clutching a hole that continues to spill without reprieve. \n\n\nBefore anyone can truly prepare, strength that shouldn’t be possessed by mere children, send the door past it\u0027s hinges.\n\n\nIf the wound wasn\u0027t enough to kill, it\u0027s enough to shatter the spine.\n\n\nAnd the princess is soon underneath that door, and despite all protest\n\n\nThe screams and shouts fade into mere static as blood spills from her mouth, far too much to contain inside.\n\n\nMercilessly, she expires on the floor of the foyer, before the true horror begins.\n\n\nSome would call that a fitting end for a foolish princess.\n\n\nWould you agree or disagree? \n",
  "page 45": "\"Honestly, striking Roy in the face? You\u0027re an insane one, I\u0027ll give you that.\" \n\n\nThese words come from none other than a flushed face, Evie. The half-elf is laughing as it\u0027s the greatest joke in the world that she had ever heard in her life. Just like any night, the barracks were as loud as ever. Games were being played with the coin earned from the odd or serious job or two that came to their attention.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t believe her highness is insane.\" Juliette spoke up, always quick to defend the mental faculties of the princess. \n\n\n\"Eh!? Julie, you can\u0027t honestly before that there isn\u0027t a screw loose with this one!\" \n\n\n\"No, and I\u0027m sorry that I cannot agree with that sentiment of yours.\" \n\n\n\"This is why you guys make me miss Paul. Although, it\u0027s more like a rash.\"\n\n\n\"Sir Paul? I agree, it has been a month and some time that we\u0027ve been able to hear that infectious laughter of his...\" \n\n\n\"What? Infectious? Is there something you\u0027re not telling us here?\" \n\n\n\"I-I don\u0027t believe I am?\" \n\n\nSophia wasn’t exactly sure just what kind of situation the two women were in. They both certainly spoke of Paul more times than both of them were probably aware of. Even in Evie\u0027s snide remarks, there was still a trace of fondness that could be made out. \n\n\nWhile she didn\u0027t voice this out-loud, it made Sophia think of Caspar. It was only a year ago that marrying him was something she was afraid of, but now, maybe she was the one that was being a fool. Now she wasn\u0027t sure if he was even alive, and if he was, could he even stand the sight of what she had become? The thought only sours her mood more. \n\n\nShe stands up for from her seat at the table.\n\n\n\"Your highness?\" Juliette questions, momentarily looking both confused and concerned.\n\n\n\"I think I\u0027m going to go upstai--\"\n\n\n\"Princess! There\u0027s something that I believe requires your attention.\" A soldier that enters the barracks says, giving the young woman the perfect excuse for leaving the festivities. She didn\u0027t want to be dour or sour, and possibly ruin all of the good moods that were present. No, if there was something that required her immediate attention, she would see what is was exactly. \n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia has to wonder if her eyes are seeing things correctly. The young woman is unsure of many things, as she\u0027s forced to stare down at big eyes that stare back at her, rather piercingly as well. \n\n\n\"Are you lost, little boy?\" \n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\"Where are your parents?\"\n\n\n\"I do not have parents.\" \n\n\n\"Then, you\u0027re an orphan...?\" \n\n\n\"No.\" \n\n\nSophia exhales, running a hand through her hair. Standing at the foyer of her castle and speaking with an emotionless child wasn\u0027t the path that she foresaw her day taking. As she regards the child, she notices a great many things about them. For one, they\u0027re dressed immaculately in a nice dress shirt, and a hat sits ontop of their head.\n\n\nThe outfit that the child is wearing, resembles more of a costume, than that of actual clothes that someone would honestly wear. All in all, their behavior, demeanor, choice of clothing, it was unnerving to the princess.\n\n\n\"There\u0027s a cake, with a message that we have addressed for one, Sophia Nevermore. It\u0027s to congratulate her for finally joining the race for the throne. Please, will you accept it from our creators?\"\n\n\n\"Us?\" The solider questions before four more children emerge from behind the first child. They\u0027re all dressed in the same exact style of clothing, and they do indeed bring with them a large cake. Nothing seems outwardly wrong with the giant pastry, but the use of \u0027creators\u0027 despite the child claiming to not have any parents is once again making Sophia Nevermore quite apprehensive. \n\n\nHowever, was there truly any harm in seeing what this message had to entail? \n\n\nBut they were indeed some rather unsettling children. Just what was a princess supposed to do? \n",
  "page 48": "Evie motions with her head that she\u0027ll be the first one to engage the old man. Although the human looks like a typical housekeeper, the half-elf can tell be his posture and the way he held his knives, that he was no simple domestic cleaner. There was an air about the man that was similar to that of a warrior, and any skills he may have amassed during his living years would no doubt be enhanced upon become a re-animated magical being. Evie felt her own speed when it came to range assault would be the difference maker in the battle. \n\n\n\"Now.\" She commands to the knights, who immediately to engage in combat with the zombified housekeepers. Their movements defy logic, and positions in which limbs would no doubt bend and break under pressure, only become loose so that the action that needs to be completed by the body is completed. \n\n\nFor the knights, the experience is like fighting human-made puppets without the strings attached. It adds to the already chaotic and unnerving nature of the battle, but they press on regardless. \n\n\nEvie switches to quick crossbow which she uses to fire in consecutive fashion at Frederic, whose knives meet her arrows head on, causing them to shatter into hundreds of splinters of wood. The half-elf is unphashed by her attack being stopped, and only stands still as the butler charges her with a new set of knives between his fingers.\n\n\n\"Spark!\" \n\n\nRoy is suddenly heard shouting, his staff being pointed at not only the head butler, but his allies in tandem as well. A bolt of electricity rains across the the re-animated corpses, and although they move to attempt to shrug off the attack, they lose a good number of their own when magical swords are drove through their chests. Flame swords having the effect of cooking them from the inside and causing to combust into a great smoldering inferno, before leaving behind charred corpses. \n\n\n\"Impressive,\" Frederic Crowmane remarks. \n\n\nThe old man glides through the air, rebounding away from charging soliders and allowing his knives to whistle through the air with pinpoint accuracy. This serves the result of several knights meeting their end as knives pierce through the open areas of their helmets and armor, causing quickly fatal wounds that fells down right before Evie and Roy\u0027s eyes.\n\n\nWith a grimace, Frederic regards his handiwork, not pleased in the slightest. \n\n\n\"You\u0027ll have to give it your all the next time I am open to attack.\" He suggests Roy and Evie, and the knights that remain on the battlefield, him and his fellow staff re-arming themselves with their weapons. \n",
  "page 47": "After calling everyone\u0027s attention to head to the large conference room, Sophia stood alone in her private bed chambers, reading a note given to her by her mother. It was always a source of strength to her whenever she was unhappy with how her hair may have looked on a given day, or how the dress made her modest chest seem even more... modest. However, she now had even greater things to contend with on her plate nowadays. She often had to worry about the lives of others, not just her own. There were times in which she had to plan carefully, watch the things she said, wait. It was exactly like being a noble with many great responsibilities. It was only now that she was experiencing such responsibility for herself. \n\n\nNevertheless, Sophia reads this aged letter that was once white, which has now begun browning due to its age: \n\n\nTo a very wonderful lady, who will no doubt blossom like a true Rose\n\n\nSophia Nevermore, \n\n\nI am so sorry that I cannot watch you grow into a fine queen that you will no doubt become, but remember, whenever you feel that you\u0027re pressured by this world, look deeply into yourself\n\n\nYou carry so much of me in you, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be able to accomplish a great many things of your own volition. \n\n\nWhen I was a child, I was always called a foolish girl. I fought like the boys, climbed trees, and earned more great deal of scratches. Ah, look at me go on about myself, and boys. \n\n\nBoys, you should find one that isn\u0027t afraid to push you. Maybe someone exactly like your father? I\u0027m only kidding. But, find someone who treats you with the respect that you deserve. Surround yourself with people like that, but most importantly, you must do what you feel it is you must. \n\n\nDo not fear the world. There are many beautiful things to be found.\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nYour mother, Grace Nevermore\n\n\n---\n\n\nSophia quickly would fold the letter back, almost getting lost in the contents of said letter. She lost her so soon, before she was able to even form coherent thought of the world around her. At times, the woman felt like a stranger, and at other times, something of a guardian angel whom she could call upon to receive much needed strength.\n\n\nAt the moment, she was the latter. \n\n\n\"Hey, I came to get you.\" It\u0027s a masculine voice that Sophia is greeted by, and she turns to see that it\u0027s Roy who stands at her doorway. \"I\u0027m sure you were expecting your attendant or something, but she\u0027s with the others, just waiting on you.\"\n\n\nSophia nods her head, putting away the prized possession of hers underneath her desk. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll be down now to properly greet our guests, thank you.\" \n\n\n---\n\n\n\"Do not eat the cake, you damn idiots!\" Evie commands to the room, stopping the movements of several soldiers who were mere seconds from using their fingers to scoop up a bit of the frosting. If the half-elf didn\u0027t have her qualms that the cake itself was laced with poison, and was now sitting at their very lodgings, she would have been more disgusted with the lack of tact that many of the men had possessed. \"Honestly, the very woman who had you given you all knighthood hadn’t even tasted the thing her damn self!\" Evie further comments.\n\n\nShe doesn\u0027t voice her third statement of her not even wanting the lady to eat the cake to begin with. \n\n\n\"The cake isn\u0027t poisonous.\" \n\n\n\"Not at all. In fact, it\u0027s quite delicious and made from the best natural ingredients that cannot be procured easily elsewhere.\" \n\n\n\"Quite so. That fact will become evident with just one taste of the frosting.\" \n\n\n\"Yes, it has both of our master\u0027s approval.\" \n\n\nJuliette finally finds an area in which she can finally enter herself in this conversation. Her hand goes up in the air, wanting to gather the attention of these monotone speaking children. \n\n\n\"We won\u0027t say otherwise when it comes to regarding this cake of yours, which we are grateful for.\" \n\n\nEvie snarls at the \u0027grateful\u0027 bit of Juliette\u0027s statement, and the attendant exchanges a look with her that can be surmised as, \u0027Allow me to finish here.\u0027\n\n\n\"But just who are these masters of yours?\" \n\n\n\"We will speak when Sophia Nevermore herself is present.\"\n\n\n\"I am present.\" \n\n\nAs if on cue, Sophia Nevermore appeared at the entryway of the conference room, not wasting another second in making her way inside, flanked by the mage Roy. At her presence, almost in perfect unison each and every child moved to bow. It\u0027s an act that once again almost throws the woman off, but she finds herself getting more and more acclimated to the actions of these strange children. Still, she awaits an answer. \n\n\n\"Forgive us for not greeting you properly at the entrance of the castle, but we are animated dolls, given life through our master,  your sister and brother respectively, Bridgette and Henry Nevermore.\"\n\n\nThis reverberates a chill throughout the room.\n\n\n\"How?\" Sophia asks a question that she\u0027ll no doubt regret hearing the details of, but she asks away anyway. Were these her enemies, her own younger sister and brother? Did they want to claim her life as well for their own? Would her being dead somehow provide them in some way a benefit to their own lives? \n\n\nBut maybe she was jumping ahead too far with this line of thinking, she sure hopes she is. \n\n\n\"The lives of your soliders, the townspeople. We have been responsible. Henry draws us through his paintings, which brings us into this world, but Bridgette imbues us with the ability to act in this world.\" They all point to their chest, expression unchanging as they further explained the process. \"With an adult, you need the heart of one, but in regards to a chil--\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve heard enough, please stop.\" \n\n\nSuddenly two of the \u0027dolls\u0027 step forward, hand in hand with the other. The soldiers hesitantly rest their hands on the hilt of their swords as they regard this new menace that stands before them unflinchingly. \n\n\n\"Why?\" Sophia finds herself asking through a wave of nausea. \n\n\nTwo fingers are simultaneously pointed at her.\n\n\n\"With father gone, and brother and sister enjoying themselves, we can finally do what we\u0027ve always wanted. Big sister Sophia, you are the ultimate creation that we can make!\" They both say in unison. \n\n\nThat is the girl doll steps forward. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ve always wanted to make you into one of my dolls. Before, I could only animate stuffed dolls, but now my magic has grown that it can reanimate things that Henry brings into this world with his art! I\u0027ve had so much improving upon the people of our region! I\u0027m sorry about killing some of your subjects, but we\u0027ve kind of ran out of people over here.\" \n\n\nThe boy doll then takes his turn. \n\n\n\"Yes, and I\u0027ve always wanted to draw you dying. You have always been the ideal, and I must say, it looks like you\u0027ve grown even more beautiful, sister. Bridgette had left a doll at Cecilne\u0027s and Aline\u0027s castle, at first for strategy, but who would have thought it would have given me such an amazing show of you killing off our very own sisters! Now, we can go after you without any qualms, it just chalk it up to as being strategically necessary.\" \n\n\nThe two dolls dance with one another across the room, as Sophia holds a hand to her soldiers not to lay a hand on them yet. She had a inkling of a feeling that they were not yet done with their speech. \n\n\n\"We were always going to do it, but as younger siblings, we couldn\u0027t be prouder of the sister you\u0027ve become!\" \n\n\n\"Really, honestly? Why, thank you two. So, why the cake?\" \n\n\nAlmost as if they\u0027ve forgotten about the large cake they had brought in, they look to each other. A silent conversation is shared between them via them whispering to the other before breaking out into a laugh.\n\n\n\"Why don\u0027t you check inside, at the verrrrry top. We\u0027ve had to be meticulous about that one. So we had Henry prepare it and do the honors. It was a real task not eating some of it before arriving here, and ultimately ruining the surprise, but I\u0027m sure by the looks on all of your faces, it\u0027ll be quite worth it!\" \n\n\nEvie ushers a knight over, who all of the dolls part their bodies aside so he can fish inside of the cake. \n\n\nWhat he produces from the grasp of his hand, makes nearly the entire room gasp.\n\n\nIt\u0027s an entire human hand. There\u0027s confusion before a shaking Evie with hands clasped around her mouth, confirms the worst suspicion of some in the room. \n\n\n\"C-Captain,\" she croaks out momentarily. \n\n\nThe dolls all hum and clap together at the correct answer given. \n\n\n\"He sure was strong, but he was also old. Maybe you shouldn’t have sent him sniffing around?\"\n\n\nEvie had heard enough, and so did many of the knights in the room who all pulled out a combination of weapons. In child-sized bodies are not, these were inhuman demons that needed to be put down. \n\n\nHowever before any of that happened, the re-animated dolls began to shake uncontrollably, as blood spilled from their eyes and mouths. It was only a matter of seconds before blood burst from their chest and coated the very cake they had brought in, and the room itself with their blood. \n\n\n\"Hehehehe, we\u0027re in Cycla region... we look forward to turning you all into dolls.\"\n\n\nSophia shook, her heart drummed loudly in her chest, and she could hear it in her ears. Tears were fought back, and they didn\u0027t cascade down her cheeks. No, she couldn’t afford to cry again. She never knew her family to be this... twisted and deranged. No amount of apologies could possibly wash away all the blood and sins that they carried in their detestable blood. \n\n\nShe was also detestable, and as she looked to a crestfallen Juliette who had fallen to her knees, but wa still trying to comfort Evie, Sophia Nevermore knew that she was different. There were no kind words she could find. \n\n\n\"I will kill them. As their older sister, I will take responsibility for the younger siblings. I\u0027m not sure if they\u0027ve always been this way.\"\n\n\nSophia Nevermore tried to sound detached, but the anger she was feeling made that a difficult thing. She was angry with herself for being so blind to the nature of people, so very foolish...\n\n\n\"We march tomorrow.\" \n",
  "page 49": "\"Just follow my lead!\" The hotheaded mage shouts out, clobbering his staff onto the ground. \n\n\nSoon fire commences and begins to swirl around his boots. Roy\u0027s incantation is silent, but the results are still the same as if he commanded the words out-loud to be heard by his enemies. \n\n\nEvie squints her eyes, aiming her bow and trying to zero in to take a shot through the swirling mass of flames. She would consider herself something of an adequate archer, so it would only take her a second or two longer for her to be able to make her arrows hit the perfect mark to send the flames licking up even higher. \n\n\n--x\n\n\nFor a trained assassin, one second is all that is needed for them. \n\n\nFrederic Crowmane\u0027s skill hasn\u0027t waned since passing from the mortal coil, and subsequently being returned back to the world of living. Magic spells have an activation period, and that\u0027s always been a mage\u0027s weakness, even a powerful one. \n\n\nAlthough many of the re-animated staff are reduced to charred remains \n\n\nThe master butler\u0027s knife meets their mark as he emerges from the flames, throwing his knives at the head of the mage.\n\n\nIt hits his mark and fells him, and the surprise of her ally being killed, opens up the half-elf woman to have her chest punched. The butler\u0027s white gloves would be coated in blood as he would crush the heart. \n\n\nEffectively bringing an end to a strong foundation that made up the enemy\u0027s forces. \n",
  "page 40": "\"There\u0027s no way you could forgive me for taking her away from you, and there\u0027s no way I can forgive you for hating him. If anything, it\u0027s you and her that probably killed him.\" \n\n\nAline quickly shakes her head back and forth, dragging herself backwards in an attempt to get away. \n\n\nThe reality of the situation, her impending demise, it robs her from the ability of being able to even get up and run. Fear is what robs her of rational thought, but eventually she is able to get up and quickly attempt at running away from her sister. \n\n\n\"If the roles were reversed, you wouldn’t offer this mercy, but I will you,\" Sophia speaks softly.\n\n\nHer own fear of the situation gives her a burst of adrenaline, and her hand reaches out and pulls at the roots of her sister\u0027s hair. Flailing and futilely kicking is all she can do. The sight itself is almost pitiable, and it makes Sophia hesitate, but only for a moment, before the same knife that was used to kill the other twin, is now aimed at the other. \n\n\n\"Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive m--\" \n\n\nSophia plunges the knife through her sister\u0027s throat, effectively putting an end to the life of Aline Nevermore. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry.\" She weakly lets out before collapsing onto of the bodies of her sisters. They were all growing cold. They were growing cold in body, and she were in heart. \n\n\nSophia Nevermore had killed both Celine and Aline Nevermore. \n\n\nOne could only imagine how the other siblings would react. Would they now see her as a threat to the vacant crown and send their best to have her killed? Would even her brothers and sisters that she were cordial with, now want her head? The thought alone is enough to make her finally whimper. \n\n\nExhaustion pulls her into a darkness. \n\n\n---\n\n\n\"Night gnomes?\" \n\n\nSophia asks from her chair inside the throne room. It was her castle now, apparently her sisters had taken refuge in an old castle that once belonged to their father. And now it was hers.\n\n\nIt\u0027s a sobering thought, but there were other matters to attend to. Her eyes were no doubt red, Sophia didn\u0027t care if they were puffy as well. Tonight, she would still have some shred of humanity and empathy. Because after all, she was sure that eventually even that would be taken from her as well. Either that, or her life, whichever happened first in the process. \n\n\n\"Yes, they were discovered in the underground chambers.\" Julliette reports to her princess. \"They\u0027re cannibalistic in nature, and would have surely given us trouble if we were to have attacked at nightfall.\" \n\n\nEvie snickers, Paul looks slightly red in the face. \n\n\nAnd Sophia Nevermore...\n\n\n\"What matters is that they\u0027re ours now. Everything that my sisters used against us, their men we\u0027ve taken prisoner, and even the beds that they\u0027ve slept in, they are ours. As for the mages.\"\n\n\nSophia looked to Juliette for further clarification. \n\n\n\"Only one of them survived, but I believe they can be won over to our sid--\"\n\n\n\"Just tell them that it\u0027s their loyalty to your cause, or their life. That should be easy enough to win them over.\" Evie suddenly speaks up, cutting off Juliette. \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t think fear is something that inspires true loyalty.\" \n\n\nSophia exhales loudly, burying her head into her arms as she rested on the wide mahogany desk in the room. Juliette sensing the princess\u0027s tiredness, only looks to the others.\n\n\n\"Then again, perhaps we should discuss these matters later when we\u0027re well-rested?\"\n",
  "page 42": "Slap\n\n\nEven a trained mage cannot ignore the stinging of their face when it\u0027s suddenly struck. The barracks that were once bustling with movement, talking, and laughter, goes silent upon the appearance of their princess. \n\n\nRoy\u0027s head is forced to move with the impact, and he is shocked beyond words and belief. The thought that races through his mind most likely questions the woman\u0027s sanity. With a muttered string of words, he could cause men that can fell dozens with their sword to meet the strength of greater beings that seldom walk alongside mortal men, and yet, this slender woman who seemed to still be growing in body had slapped him despite it all.\n\n\nHe\u0027s stunned, so stunned that he can only listen to the next words that leave her mouth.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re more powerful than me, now, currently. However, do not think my words are something meaningless that do not pertain to you. Can I ask you this, do you believe that you can kill this entire room, here and now?\" \n\n\nRoy grits his teeth, but doesn\u0027t say a word.\n\n\n\"Please answer me.\"\n\n\n\"No.\" \n\n\nSophia nods upon getting her answer, holding her hand out, Juliette sensing what she perhaps wants, hands the woman a white cooling cloth, who in return holds it out for Roy to take. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re needed here. Our enemies are great in number, unknown in tactics, and they wish us ruin. I don\u0027t know who they are yet, but I will not allow them to get away with their actions. Be it they another brother of mine, or sister, or maybe someone I may have known since childhood, whoever it is, they will not get away with spilling the blood of innocent people, nor our comrades.\"\n\n\nSophia, takes a breath, holding out the cooling press out even more for Roy to take. Which the young mage does.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not sitting here hiding in fear, but I am waiting until our enemies reveal their hand too much, so that we can bite that hand. We\u0027ll bite down on it, and we won\u0027t let go, until whatever piece of the kingdom that they hold onto is wrestled from their grip.\"\n\n\n\"I-I see, is that really so? This isn\u0027t just hot air you\u0027re spewing, is it?\" Roy asks as he sets the cooling pad down on his cheek.\n\n\nSophia only laughs, placing a pristine white gloved of her own on the cooling pad as well. She doesn\u0027t think nothing of the fact of this rather intimate gesture. This was in fact still one of her knights after all. \n\n\n\"Not anymore. I must keep going, or the blood already spilt will be for naught. It would be heinous to the departed.\" \n",
  "page 41": "-Year 19-\n\n\nOne year has passed since Sophia Nevermore\u0027s life had changed forever. Gone were the days in which she spent a great deal of time in her room, allowing the day to pass her by listlessly, only retreating from the safety of her room for a rare ball or party. It was on days like that she was able to spend moments with the man responsible for the cushiness that was her life in her father. However, the attention of her father wasn\u0027t the only thing that brought her some semblance of happiness. It was the days in which she could spend time with her older brother Noel, and her older sister as well, Penelope. Unfortunately, they both became quite busy with the new positions that father had felt fitting of granting them, and thus their appearances had become something of a rare sight for her to be able to behold. \n\n\nNow, things were so different. And she was still a princess in title, but she now had her own responsibilities. Sophia now had a routine that she followed for every morning: wake up early, bathe, eat breakfast, and then go about the managing of her own little territory. Of course she wasn\u0027t alone in this, Juliette her faithful attendant was still very much a constant presence at her side.\n\n\nAnd regarding Juliette Forthwight, a new more appropriate title would really have to be given to her eventually. \n\n\nUnfortunately, matters such as those were on the back-burner. The reason being? The situation they were in was a rather precarious one, and there had reported sightings of strange creatures roaming the night outside the edges of her territory. Citizens, and even the men that had presently taken up arms under her banner have been found killed in grotesque and near unexplainable ways. This was all becoming a constant headache for the princess, and she felt herself reaching for a phantom cup of coffee that wasn\u0027t there. \n\n\n\"Here, your highness.\" Juliette had appeared at her side, almost as if she was a mind reader, placing a cup of freshly brewed coffee on her desk. The woman was the very picture of poise, as she stood by the princess\u0027s side. It was only a hear that had passed, yet Sophia thought that the other young woman was growing into quite a beautiful lady. \n\n\n\"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re not hanging around with the knights, providing them all--especially Paul--with your own amazing coffee.\" Sophia teased as she took a small sip of the coffee, enjoying the taste and how it awoke her senses.\n\n\nJuliette for her part could only look scandalized by the implication that wasn’t lost on her. \n\n\n\"Your highness! I only linger around the man so that he wouldn’t suddenly collapse.\" She then pouted, wiping her hands off on the dark navy colored skirt that she was wearing. \"He\u0027s a bit older than the both of us, but hear this! Can you believe that he\u0027s only thirty! From his temperament, I thought he would be a bit older, no?\" \n\n\nSophia could only blink, her look of astonishment bringing a gentle laugh to spill out from Juliette\u0027s lips. \n\n\n\"I-I wouldn’t have known that, in all honesty.\" \n\n\nWith that, the two enjoyed a comfortable silence. That was until they were brought out of that comfortable silence by an urgent knocking coming from outside the closed room they were in. \n\n\n\"Come in,\" Sophia states, exchanging glances with her attendant. \n\n\nIt\u0027s not a long wait before the door is opened, revealing a young solider who looks anything but calm. From the look of his posture, he would rather be elsewhere than being the bearer of the news he was about to relay.\n\n\n\"Your highness, please excuse me, but this is something that should be brought to your attention.\"\n\n\n\"Okay, and what is it?\" Sophia questions him. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s the vice-captain, Roy. He\u0027s trying to convince any soldier that will listen to him that we should ride off quickly and find out the source of what\u0027s been maiming some of the townfolk, and some of our fellow men.\"\n\n\nSophia hummed out-loud, Juliette could only sigh. \n\n\n\"Perhaps, I should take to him? I think that I\u0027ll be able to convince him otherwis--\" \n\n\n\"No. That won\u0027t do. I\u0027ll handle it.\" \n\n\nSophia rose from her seat, and began moving towards the door. Her attendant followed behind her silently, and the solider jumped out of her way to give her more than adequate space before falling in line behind her back as well. \n\n\nTheir destination would of course have to be the barracks. That would be where most of their forces are after all.\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoy. He was previously a mage in the service of Sophia\u0027s recently departed sisters. However, he was under their care far longer than even before the king had met his end by one (or more) of his own kin. He was inexperienced, but believed that his strength could turn the tide of any battle. Effectively losing and being captured, staying a week in the dingy cells of the castle did surprisingly little to humble him, but it did humble him slightly.\n\n\nBut obviously still not enough to stop him from still trying to undermine Sophia Nevermore. \n\n\nShe figured that he still had some lingering resentment for her killing the two of those twins. Maybe such a thing was the case because he either loved one or them, Ceciline or Aline, or the both of them.\n\n\nSophia couldn’t be bothered to care which it was, but cared more for the risk of life that he would do. It wasn\u0027t just his own life that he was potentially putting to danger, but some of the men which she had knighted on her word. Such a thing, the young women couldn’t stand for. And not wholly out of any moral sense, but because of the fact that they\u0027ve barely had any men to spare for a currently invisible foe that already showed feats of being able to kill some of them.\n\n\nNo, this would have to be nipped in the bud immediately.\n\n\nStill, what was the correct choice of action to be making? Maybe Roy had a point, that they were sitting on their hands and knees without much outside of the castle that they\u0027ve now had to show for it. Maybe it was indeed time for them to unmask this foe of theirs. However, if she allowed this disrespect to continue, would the tentative respect of her men that she had garnered throughout the year be shattered?\n\n\nOr maybe this entire situation was a headache that wasn\u0027t no longer worth it? Sophia had certainly showed her other siblings that she was no mere sheltered princess no longer, and that she was willing to fight back to continue breathing. Maybe she could just grab her bags, and leave with Juliette? \n\n\nDecisions.\n",

  "page 102": "\"Hold on!\" \n\n\nSophia runs over to grab both of the wizards hands, stopping them from going any further. If this was already turning into a disaster, then she would like for it be a disaster for her enemies, and not her. \n\n\n\"You two, are you really going to forge ahead without showing us your amazing combination spell?

  "page 107": "Sophia shakes her head, breaking away from Caspar so that she could move and slightly hunch over to speak with her little sister. Their difference in height wasn\u0027t so great, but still, she wanted to be the mature one when she was already feeling quite terrible for having to decline an invitation from Bridgette to begin with. \n\n\n\"Maybe next time, Bridgette.

She was hoping that the gods would be kind enough to even give her twenty,  and thirty if they were feeling extra giving. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll give you the count of five.\" Zeska tells the attendant. \n\n\n\"Please run, your highness.\" \n\n\n\"One,\" Zeska heaves her sword on her shoulder and takes her first step forward.\n\n\n\"Princess, please.\"\n\n\n\"Two,\" \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t want to leave you here to die!\"\n\n\n\"Three,\"\n\n\n\"But you must live. I\u0027ll be right behind you shortly.\"\n\n\n\"Do you think me a child? I know when you\u0027re lying!\" \n\n\n\"Four,\" \n\n\n\"Princess, please.\" Juliette stresses even more urgently to the other woman.\n\n\n\"I-I...\"\n\n\n\"Five! I\u0027m coming at you both now.\" \n\n\nZeska immediately springs into action, her movements still fast even with the large sword she carries. It seems carrying around such a large hunk of iron didn\u0027t impede her at all, but made her even more superhuman. \n\n\nThere is only seconds to make a decision for Sophia Nevermore. \n",
  "page 51": "So far, the battle was swinging in Roy and Evie\u0027s favor. Although the man they were facing had the advantage of experience, and no longer being alive among that, all it would take is a few more big moves to fully claim victory. Still, both the mage and the archer were slightly weary of becoming too aggressive and leaving themselves open for an attack that could incapacitate or outright end their lives. It\u0027s through this mindset, that ultimately, victory is taken from their heads. \n\n\nFrederic Crowmane is able to recover, watching carefully the attacks of both the mage and half-elf. They were still trying to face him, but with not nearly as much gusto as before.\n\n\nIt was really a shame, too. He would have enjoyed being able to take his time with fighting such opponents who carried as much potential as these two, however the silent order for him to kill his opponents without waste of time, was much too ingrained in his resurrected body.\n\n\n--x\n\n\nThe Butler takes a stance, before kicking off with full momentum \n\n\nHe moves faster than a man his appearance should, but he was no mere ordinary man. \n\n\nThere are ten throwing knives that slip in between ten of the digits on his hands.\n\n\nAn arrow misses him as he boosts his jumping height via a pillar in his environment. He throws the knives in such a way that they bounce off and ricochet off one another, before falling down like hail on his two opponents. \n\n\nThe knives each find their mark, all five each hitting Evie and Roy, before the two individuals collapse in a heap on the floor. Their blood soon begins to pool, as the butler takes his last bow for them. \n",
  "page 50": "The old man had basically giving them the appropriate approach for them to be taking. Both Evie and Roy look to each other and nod, readying the last of their spells. All of the constant fighting had placed them each on one final spell, and that would have to be used to best the opponent that stood before them.\n\n\n\"I must ask. Are you seriously just some common butler?\" It\u0027s Roy that inquires. \n\n\nFredric only shakes his head to this. \n\n\n\"No, I cannot say that I am just a run of the mill butler.\" He twirls the throwing knives with finesse. \"I\u0027m one the head butler appointed by the late king Nevermore himself. However before that, I was an assassin whose life he spared.\"\n\n\nEvie nodded her head, the half-elf taking in this information with some interest. \n\n\nAlthough the archer had an grudge with the demented children, even she could see that the butler was also a victim in some way. He probably followed the children because he thought they would need the most help in this conflict. How could he imagine that they would end up turning him into something that wasn\u0027t human?\n\n\nAll her and Roy could do was put a stop to him. It was for his sake too at this point. \n\n\n\"Wind spirits,\" Evie began, placing three arrows in the quiver of her bow. There was no more time for uncertainties, or things that could not be predicted that could possibly throw her arrows off the destination she wanted them to fly.\n\n\nThey had to hit for sure. \n\n\n\"Gods, allow me this brief dominion over the wind.\" Roy began, that is until Evie threw him a quick blanching stare. \n\n\n\"Wind too?\" \n\n\n\"Are you trying to ruin the incantation? Any other mage would have had to start over, when a second can mean life or death for us! Damn it! Better be ready to shoot those arrows!\" \n\n\nRoy shouted before his staff was raised at the old man, unleashing a torrent of powerful cutting winds that uprooted some of the re-animated servants from their positions, causing them to slam defenselessly into the ground. This gave the remaining knights the push they needed to mop up the rest of their foes. \n\n\nFrederic Crowmane was of course made out of stronger stuff. The butler was even able to throw out knives that Roy struggled to dodge so that it wouldn\u0027t hit anywhere fatal on his person. The mage was only able to dodge a few before two sunk into his shoulder. He fights to make a huge commotion of his pain, but the spellcaster is forced to kneel in his pain. Burrowed deep are the knives, and he is briefly left at the mercy of more attacks, but fortunately they never do come.\n\n\n\"Fly true!\" \n\n\nEvie commands her arrows that shoot out, unfettered by any possible manipulation as they each hit their mark in the butler. One arrow is sent through his chest, the second notches it even deeper, and the third hits the arm of the man\u0027s body as he tries to shield himself from further damage. \n\n\n\"Impressive, this damage... It\u0027s fatal.\" He comments, before he too kneels on the ground. The man bleeds out without any feeling of pain, but a feeling akin to elation. \n\n\nEvie pulls Roy to his feet, so that they can both properly see the man off. \n\n\n\"You gave us quite the battle.\" Roy said through a grimace. \n\n\n\"Sorry for that,\" Frederic replies. \n\n\n\"Don\u0027t be,\" Evie motions with her hand. \"We\u0027ve won, haven\u0027t we? Now I\u0027d be more angry if you were able to do us in. Then you would have to apologize over our dead bodies.\" \n\n\nFrederic lets out one last laugh, before he laughs no longer. \n",
  "page 53": "Sophia grabs Juliette\u0027s hand and begins tugging at it earnestly. There was no time for them to be heading towards the stables, besides, the stables were probably a madhouse in its own right, and they would meet their ends there as well. \n\n\n\"Let\u0027s just run! We can hide if need be, and then find a horse or two when we\u0027ve far removed ourselves from here!\" \n\n\nIt takes all of the courage in her to muster these words, but for once it\u0027s Sophia Nevermore that leads the always capable attendant around by the hand. It isn\u0027t long before that have put some distance between themselves the palace, scaling over the large wall with only minor bruises, scrapes, and cuts to show for their effort.\n\n\n\"You two are in a hurry.\" \n\n\nZeska Orlov, Captain of the Royal Guard stands with her back rested on a tree. The famous sword of IronForce resting peacefully out of its sheathe. The woman doesn\u0027t make a motion of movement yet.\n\n\n\"Finally! A friendly face.\" Sophia moves to walk over to the woman. \"We can use your help getting out of her--\" She\u0027s quickly pulled back roughly by Juliette, whom forces her behind her back. \n\n\nZeska whistles at the sight, but doesn\u0027t look displeased in the slightest. \n\n\n\"W-What... What is the meaning of thi--\"\n\n\n\"Your highness, please run at my signal.\"\n\n\nZeska looks as if she\u0027s seeing double, that is before she begins shaking her head with a chuckle that she cuts short as she picks up her large cleaver-like sword. \n\n\n\"How much of a distraction do you really think that you can provide here?\" \n\n\n\"Seconds if I\u0027m lucky, perhaps?\" \n\n\n\"Juliette..?\" Sophia looks back and forth between the two women, feeling more and more of an unnerving feeling that reverberates throughout her very core. Why was Zeska so suddenly menacing? \n\n\n\"I like you, Juliette. I\u0027ll hold back, so there\u0027s sureness that there\u0027s an open casket that can be had.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you.\" Juliette answers, her face settling into a frown as she gets into a self-defense stance. It would take every lesson of hers to even survive five seconds against such a renowned foe.

  "page 52": "\"We should grab our horse, Juliette.\" Sophia cuts in on Juliette\u0027s verbal planning. \"There\u0027s no way we\u0027ll be able to cover enough distance from away from the castle just by walking. We\u0027ll certainly end up being caught, and being caught is the last thing we both want, isn’t it?\" Sophia asks her rhetorical question. \n\n\nJuliette nods in agreement. \n\n\n\"We certainly do not want that, your highness.\" For the princess\u0027s first act of running away to end in disaster on the very first night, how poor a quality an attendant would she be if she let such a thing come to pass? She wouldn\u0027t be a very good one to say the least. There were many preparations, but it wasn\u0027t a task that she would be unable to handle. No, Juliette would do as much as she possibly could to bring the princess her happiness.\n\n\nThat was where her loyalty began, and what took up the bulk of her intentions. \n\n\n---\n\n\nWith traveling cloaks on, and belongings and essentials packed lightly, two figures move in the dead of night to avoid attention of the night guards on patrol. It\u0027s only when the two figures enter the stables does a sound finally emit from the two.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re actually doing it, Juliette.\" Sophia whispers with jubilance in her tone. Before it was mere fantasy, for the past few days of her thinking these thoughts, it was finally becoming a reality. \"You have the key to the stables, don\u0027t you?\" \n\n\nJuliette reveals one key, that shines through the darkness of the night. \n\n\n\"Yes, as soon as we grab our horses, we\u0027ll lock the stables from the outside. The knights should have some minor difficulties with being able to chase us immediately if we do so. We will have to find an inn, instead of continuing on horseback. I\u0027m sure they would catch our trail if we continued to move throughout the night.\" \n\n\nSophia smiled, looking quite content. \n\n\n\"That\u0027s perfect.\" \n",
  "page 110": "\"Why can’t we go with you, your highness?\" \n\n\nJuliette looks to be on the verge of her head exploding. Sophia however doesn’t yet say a word, throwing her traveling cloak over her body and securing it with a few clasps. \n\n\n\"Because someone has to be in charge when I\u0027m gone.\" She says as it is the most simple explanation in the world. \"It doesn\u0027t make sense for all of us to go into this unsure situation. I feel more safe if I\u0027ve left you all to handle things while I\u0027m away handling these matters.\" \n\n\nRoy shakes his head, leaning backwards on one of the pillars that adorned the entranceway of their castle. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re the most important one. Both the Queen and our leader.\"\n\n\n\"In short, he\u0027s saying that he\u0027ll miss you too much.\" Evie teases mercilessly. \n\n\nJuliette doesn\u0027t find humor in light of the situation, and the worry on her face only deepens even more.\n\n\n\"Your highness...\" \n\n\n\"Juliette, your face will wrinkle prematurely if you keep doing that.\" Paul chimes in, his arms crossed behind the back of his head. \"It would be a damn shame if that were to happen.\" The knight captain\u0027s face grows serious for a moment. \"If you take too long, we\u0027ll come rushing in, but you already know that, don\u0027t you?\" \n\n\nSophia smiles at her small little band. It\u0027s only been two years since she\u0027s known some of them, but she feels that she can already trust them to handle the things that she cannot. There were a great many things that she couldn\u0027t handle after all. \n\n\n\"Juliette, they\u0027ll have to listen to you. So you\u0027re going to have to keep a cool head, understand?\"\n\n\nThe advisor is only able to solemnly nod her head to this. This felt like a situation in which she couldn’t convince the woman of anything else. She would just have to have faith in her abilities. \n\n\n-x-\n\n\nIt takes a three and a half days on horseback to reach the Holt Kingdom. With the Nevermore\u0027s and Holt\u0027s being allies for so long, it only made sense that their territories weren\u0027t too far apart from one another. Over the course of those three days, Sophia Nevermore shares a fire with some of her knights, hearing them recount stories which she had never heard before, details of their lives she was unaware of until now. \n\n\nSome of the knights seem surprised to hear she\u0027s nothing more than a recluse for most of her life. It\u0027s amusing to say the least, but eventually their journey is at an end, and they\u0027re all ushered into to meet the acting king. \n\n\nThere are comfortable chairs that adorn the meeting room, and places for the knights to unloosen and unequip themselves from the heavy equipment of their arms and armor. Tea is given to all, as well as biscuits that Sophia recognizes as her favorite. Although the taste is slightly off, it does still taste better than stale bread. \n\n\n\"Ah, Sophia Nevermore, is it still princess? Or are you truly a queen now?\" \n\n\n\"Whatever title fits the occasion at the given time.\" \n\n\nSophia answers as she turns to meet the gaunt figure of Reginald Holt. The man seems to have aged several years, but as a child, he was a man that was always seemed old to her to begin with. Of course the man still had many inches on her, but se figured that would be the case for most of the men who she would interact with in her life.\n\n\nHow unfortunate, Sophia always admired how tall her older sister Penelope was. \n\n\nThere\u0027s a moment in which pleasantries are exchanged first. Any real business is halted as mundane questions are put at the forefront instead at first. It\u0027s only half an hour into their conversation does Reginald lean back in the seat, clasping his hands.\n\n\n\"So, you\u0027re finally going to engage in a war effort against Noel and Penelope? I cannot say it doesn\u0027t hurt for me to even say those even words, but it\u0027s unfortunate, do you not believe so?\" \n\n\nThe woman nods her head in agreement, taking a sip from the beverage offered to her. \n\n\n\"It is indeed, but it is the only path in which the answers I seek can be answered, I fear. If there was a way in which this could be avoided, I wouldn\u0027t be here asking for assistance in the form of you lending some of Holt\u0027s troops.\" \n\n\nSophia placed her cup down on the table, assuming a thoughtful expression. \n\n\n\"I wonder if Caspar and Eldred are doing alright. It\u0027s said that they\u0027ve disappeared around the same time was father was slain, right? They say it\u0027s a good chance that it was my brother and sister that did it, but I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve had to have some help. It sounds too good to be true that the two of them could throw our kingdom into such a state of disarray with only their efforts alone. Wouldn’t you not agree to that, acting King, Reginald Holt?\"\n\n\nThe old king only mirthfully chuckles, wiping the look of mild astonishment from his face to raise his hand and snap his fingers. At that action, his own soldiers move into the room, their blades aimed at the unsuspecting knights. \n\n\n\"You\u0027ve truly grown into a fine woman. You mirror your mother in many ways. I\u0027ve been thinking since seeing you two years ago, seeing my grandson tugging at your arm, only for you to bring embarrassment upon yourself. This old man has been thinking you\u0027re wasted on an overly excited child like that. It\u0027s that very reason that I had to get rid of him, my own grandson, oh and my son, too! What a crying shame! Betraying your father, helping the prince and princess, you can say it to be unfortunate collateral.\"\n\n\nSophia feels only contempt for the old man that stares at her with uninhibited lust. To openly admit to such things, she wondered if he was the same man that would visit her birthday party with extravagant presents.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re barely a man, but a monster wearing the flesh of a man.\" \n\n\n\"Wouldn’t that go for you as well? Your hands aren\u0027t exactly free of blood. It\u0027s a path paved with blood that has you led you here.\" \n\n\nSophia looks away from the man\u0027s stare. He almost seems too excited to point out such a fact. Reginald is not wrong at all. There were times she looked at the mirror that she saw faces of those whose lives were extinguished in which she was either directly responsible for, or played a part in. It wasn\u0027t something she enjoyed, but that still did little to change the reality of the fact that the blood at her feet almost made it too difficult to walk. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re suffering. I can tell. I have a proposition for you. Become my woman and you won\u0027t have to walk this bloody path any longer. Forget about staining your hands with even more of your siblings blood. You can even return to your life of old, with even more comforts than you\u0027ve had before. It\u0027s either that, or rot in a cell.\"\n\n\nSophia Nevermore\u0027s choices were laid out to her, as heavy and as suffocating as they were. \n",
  "page 66": "There was no way she would let Juliette suffer the fate of having to be responsible for both of their safety and protection. Sophia quickly rushes over to the knife, clutching it with two hands as she immediately shoves it straight into the nearest stuffed creature that thinks of closing in on her.\n\n\n\"Your highness! This situation isn\u0027t an ideal one!\" \n\n\nJuliette herself is able to hold her own, stabbing through a miniature stuffed bear, and quickly yanking her knife out to stab into a dog that had leapt up onto her arm to sink its teeth into. \n\n\n\"Ahh! Oh... It doesn\u0027t hurt. Right, they\u0027re still stuffed creatures.\" Juliette remarks, leaving her knife in the dog as she backs up. \"Still, we\u0027re going to be overwhelmed and suffocated by this point.\" \n\n\nSophia Nevermore couldn’t possibly have foreseen her life coming to an end, via being overwhelmed by a surge of stuffed creatures. Soon she\u0027s back to back with Juliette, staring down an utter dismal fate. It was almost so laughable and pitiable at the same time, that she\u0027s only allowed an hollow laugh as her vision soon becomes obscured. \n\n\n--x\n\n\nA warped sense of love can more often than not be the greatest cruelty. \n\n\nIt\u0027s not soon that Sophia Nevermore finds her body dropping to the floor, joining her attendant\u0027s. \n\n\nThe hand marks around their throats is something that Bridgette and Henry Nevermore hopes doesn\u0027t linger permanently. \n\n\nIt would certainly ruin the quality of them as dolls.\n\n\nSoon their bodies are dragged out, to be placed under a knife and made \u0027better\u0027 \n\n\nDeath would just be the beginning\n\n\nSuch a cruel and befitting fate for a foolish princess.\n\n\nUnless, that statement is disagreeable with you, the reader. \n",
  "page 68": "Sophia and Juliette find themselves walking down the corridors of this large castle. In their journey, they are uncontested by any thing that may want to claim their lives. This does very little to stop the two from feeling on edge. Although she regarded the environment with the lense that she was visiting family, that family was also her enemy. \n\n\nToday someone was going to draw their last breath on this earth. \n\n\n\"Your highness,\" Juliette speaks up to get the princess\u0027s attention, pointing out the drawn cues they were given to follow. \"I believe that is meant for the both of us.\" \n\n\nIt doesn\u0027t take long for them to find themselves in what can only be described as a \u0027playroom\u0027. Everywhere one could look, the environment would be decorated with all types of stuffed creations and treats. And from a balcony stood Bridgette and Henry Nevermore who looked down at their older sister with empty smiles. \n\n\n\"Big sister! You\u0027ve certainly been busy! You took everything from our sisters and made it into your own strength. Everything, those men whom you gave the title of knight sure are performing admirably.\" Bridgette comments, not seeming the least bit upset at the ongoing events that were happening from beyond the room. If anything, she seemed to enjoy the spectacle of death that she had a hand ib bringing into fruition. \n\n\nHenry on the otherhand looked slightly crestfallen. \n\n\n\"I-I\u0027m unsure how to feel. You\u0027ve certainly become harder to kill, but now it\u0027s only you and Juliette.\"\n\n\nBridgette crinkles her nose. \n\n\n\"Making a Juliette doll was not in the cards, but can you have Sophia without the other? We have to complete the set, lest our sister becomes lonely in her soon to be new life.\" \n\n\nSophia couldn’t find the energy for any remarks to make. The woman only wanted to get this over with so she could get everything over with. All of this killing was becoming too much of a routine thing. However, it seemed that there was just one more hurdle to overcome if she wanted to move onto accomplishing just that. \n\n\nBut true as her young siblings have said, she was indeed surrounded. \n\n\nAll of the stuffed creatures and beings alike began to move, and she was unarmed. \n\n\n\"Stay behind me, your highness!\" Juliette moved in front of her, shielding her from any potential harm from the front. However there were still creatures enclosing in on them from all of their sides. \n\n\nOn a far table table in the room, she spots a knife. It\u0027s tempting to grasp, but Juliette could be overwhelmed any moment. \n\n\nThe hands on the clock were ever ticking down.

At that action, his own soldiers move into the room, their blades aimed at the unsuspecting knights. \n\n\n\"You\u0027ve truly grown into a fine woman. You mirror your mother in many ways. I\u0027ve been thinking since seeing you two years ago, seeing my grandson tugging at your arm, only for you to bring embarrassment upon yourself. This old man has been thinking you\u0027re wasted on an overly excited child like that. It\u0027s that very reason that I had to get rid of him, my own grandson, oh and my son, too! What a crying shame! Betraying your father, helping the prince and princess, you can say it to be unfortunate collateral.\"\n\n\nSophia feels only contempt for the old man that stares at her with uninhibited lust. To openly admit to such things, she wondered if he was the same man that would visit her birthday party with extravagant presents.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re barely a man, but a monster wearing the flesh of a man.\" \n\n\n\"Wouldn’t that go for you as well? Your hands aren\u0027t exactly free of blood. It\u0027s a path paved with blood that has you led you here.\" \n\n\nSophia looks away from the man\u0027s stare. He almost seems too excited to point out such a fact. Reginald is not wrong at all. There were times she looked at the mirror that she saw faces of those whose lives were extinguished in which she was either directly responsible for, or played a part in. It wasn\u0027t something she enjoyed, but that still did little to change the reality of the fact that the blood at her feet almost made it too difficult to walk. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re suffering. I can tell. I have a proposition for you. Become my woman and you won\u0027t have to walk this bloody path any longer. Forget about staining your hands with even more of your siblings blood. You can even return to your life of old, with even more comforts than you\u0027ve had before. It\u0027s either that, or rot in a cell.\"\n\n\nSophia Nevermore\u0027s choices were laid out to her, as heavy and as suffocating as they were. \n",
  "page 60": "Sophia and Juliette find themselves walking down the corridors of this large castle. In their journey, they are uncontested by any thing that may want to claim their lives. This does very little to stop the two from feeling on edge. Although she regarded the environment with the lense that she was visiting family, that family was also her enemy. \n\n\nToday someone was going to draw their last breath on this earth. \n\n\n\"Your highness,\" Juliette speaks up to get the princess\u0027s attention, pointing out the drawn cues they were given to follow. \"I believe that is meant for the both of us.\" \n\n\nIt doesn\u0027t take long for them to find themselves in what can only be described as a \u0027playroom\u0027. Everywhere one could look, the environment would be decorated with all types of stuffed creations and treats. And from a balcony stood Bridgette and Henry Nevermore who looked down at their older sister with empty smiles. \n\n\n\"Big sister! You\u0027ve certainly been busy! You took everything from our sisters and made it into your own strength. Everything, those men whom you gave the title of knight sure are performing admirably.\" Bridgette comments, not seeming the least bit upset at the ongoing events that were happening from beyond the room. If anything, she seemed to enjoy the spectacle of death that she had a hand ib bringing into fruition. \n\n\nHenry on the otherhand looked slightly crestfallen. \n\n\n\"I-I\u0027m unsure how to feel. You\u0027ve certainly become harder to kill, but now it\u0027s only you and Juliette.\"\n\n\nBridgette crinkles her nose. \n\n\n\"Making a Juliette doll was not in the cards, but can you have Sophia without the other? We have to complete the set, lest our sister becomes lonely in her soon to be new life.\" \n\n\nSophia couldn’t find the energy for any remarks to make. The woman only wanted to get this over with so she could get everything over with. All of this killing was becoming too much of a routine thing. However, it seemed that there was just one more hurdle to overcome if she wanted to move onto accomplishing just that. \n\n\nBut true as her young siblings have said, she was indeed surrounded. \n\n\nAll of the stuffed creatures and beings alike began to move, and she was unarmed. \n\n\n\"Stay behind me, your highness!\" Juliette moved in front of her, shielding her from any potential harm from the front. However there were still creatures enclosing in on them from all of their sides. \n\n\nOn a far table table in the room, she spots a knife. It\u0027s tempting to grasp, but Juliette could be overwhelmed any moment. \n\n\nThe hands on the clock were ever ticking down. This was going to be one of Sophia Nevermore\u0027s finest moments, or her very last. \n",
  "page 62": "What differentiated Sophia Nevermore from her siblings? Was she really so unremarkable that this would be her resting place? Judging from the repeated affirmations of both Bridgette and Henry, even an eternal slumber wouldn’t it be something that would. be given to her. No, she was facing an eternity of a fate that was worse than any death that can be given to her.\n\n\nShe refused any fate that seemed unfair and cruel. It was what drove her to this point, and she wouldn’t stop rejecting and refusing death when it was so readily offered like a disliked dish. \n\n\nDid the cook not get the message? \n\n\n\"All of you should eat one another.\" Sophia stated softly, halting the movement of the stuffed creatures. \n\n\nIt seemed that a process seemed to overtake all of the creatures, as if a previous command was being overwritten for a new one. The stuffed creatures in attendance would go from moving to both apprehend and kill to cannibalizing amongst each other. A mixture of stuffing and blood flies throughout the air, as the sounds of gnawing, tearing, and swallowing commence. \n\n\nTrue fear seems to flash on the faces of both Bridgette and Henry as their own creations turn on them as well. A suspicion is confirmed as even stuffing flies from their bodies as the process of them being torn apart as well begins. \n\n\n\"No, no! Sister stop this! Big sister, stop this! No, stop this, sister!\" \n\n\n\"Make them stop! We don\u0027t want to be eaten! Sophia!\" \n\n\nEverything is so damn bright. Sophia wants to tear away from the sight, it makes her feel uneasy. The guilt is palpable, and she thinks that if maybe she was a better older sibling, she wouldn\u0027t have to be killing her own little sister and brother to begin with. But that was in a perfect world in which any of their sins could be easily wiped away, and a world in which there wasn\u0027t nearly as much blood that had already been spilled. \n\n\n\"Your highness,\" Juliette\u0027s voice cuts through the loathing, and she holds up a mirror for Sophia to look into. What stares back at her are eyes that are brimming with a brilliant cobalt. \n\n\nWas this how great magic coursing through the body felt like? Sophia felt inhuman in ways that she never had before. Juliette felt like her sight had improved several times over. No, not in a sense that she could see further, but she can sense things so much clearer now, and it\u0027s a familiar trace of energy that has the woman walking from the playroom. \n\n\nSophia Nevermore had successfully fed Bridget and Henry Nevermore to their own creations. \n\n\nNow it was time to sate the curiosity, her legs carry her to the dungeons. It\u0027s there that she sees a large muscled figure hoisted up in chains, he\u0027s missing a hand but other than that, the recently appointed knight wasn\u0027t doing as bad as she thought he would be doing. The other alternative was him being dead after all. \n\n\nPaul Kirsch opens his eyes slowly, only mustering a weakened smile at the sight that greets him. \n\n\n\"Shit, took you long enough, your highness.\"\n\n\n\"Your statement implies that victory is something that you\u0027ve always thought to be in our grasp.\" \n\n\n\"Well, it was either that or accepting that I was fucked. Glad it was you guys winning, though.\" \n\n\nFinally Juliette arrives, catching up with the rather fast moving Sophia. She nearly bumps into the other woman, an act that would be paramount to a great disrespect and even a small blunder for a woman of her position. \n\n\n\"Your highness, you could have slowed down!\" She finds herself whining anyway. \n\n\n\"Oh, a fight between the two of you? That\u0027s rare.\" Paul remarks, casually swinging back and forth from his restraints. \"I didn\u0027t pay the admission fee for this, so I hope you two ladies don\u0027t mind that.\" He still finds the ability to joke, despite being an amputee in inhuman conditions. \n\n\nJuliette for her part looks a cross between scandalized and embarrassed. \n\n\n\"Y-You\u0027re nearly naked, Sir Paul!\" \n\n\n\"...That\u0027s the thing you notice? Can you uh, get me them whenever you\u0027re ready? I need a shower, a shave, a haircut, new armor, a new weapon, and oh, a new hand if that\u0027s in the budget.\" \n",
  "page 61": "There was no way she would let Juliette suffer the fate of having to be responsible for both of their safety and protection. Sophia quickly rushes over to the knife, clutching it with two hands as she immediately shoves it straight into the nearest stuffed creature that thinks of closing in on her.\n\n\n\"Your highness! This situation isn\u0027t an ideal one!\" \n\n\nJuliette herself is able to hold her own, stabbing through a miniature stuffed bear, and quickly yanking her knife out to stab into a dog that had leapt up onto her arm to sink its teeth into. \n\n\n\"Ahh! Oh... It doesn\u0027t hurt. Right, they\u0027re still stuffed creatures.\" Juliette remarks, leaving her knife in the dog as she backs up. \"Still, we\u0027re going to be overwhelmed and suffocated by this point.\" \n\n\nSophia Nevermore couldn’t possibly have foreseen her life coming to an end, via being overwhelmed by a surge of stuffed creatures. Soon she\u0027s back to back with Juliette, staring down an utter dismal fate. It was almost so laughable and pitiable at the same time, that she\u0027s only allowed an hollow laugh as her vision soon becomes obscured. \n\n\n--x\n\n\nA warped sense of love can more often than not be the greatest cruelty. \n\n\nIt\u0027s not soon that Sophia Nevermore finds her body dropping to the floor, joining her attendant\u0027s. \n\n\nThe hand marks around their throats is something that Bridgette and Henry Nevermore hopes doesn\u0027t linger permanently. \n\n\nIt would certainly ruin the quality of them as dolls.\n\n\nSoon their bodies are dragged out, to be placed under a knife and made \u0027better\u0027 \n\n\nDeath would just be the beginning\n\n\nSuch a cruel and befitting fate for a foolish princess.\n\n\nUnless, that statement is disagreeable with you, the reader. \n",

  "page 63": "-Year Twenty-\n\n\nSophia Nevermore saw it fit to expand her reach throughout two of the territory’s she now had in her control. In the span of two years, so much had changed. Once a sheltered princess, many were now calling her,\n\n\nQueen. And if her title was going to be updated, she figured Juliette go from being a simple attendant to her main advisor. Honestly speaking, she would have given her an even grander title if the woman hadn\u0027t argued so much against it. The teachings that were so very ingrained in her was certainly tough even for her to crack.\n\n\nSuch things were often as irritating as it was amusing. \n\n\nMoving on, Paul finally did get his new hand, It was made out of the toughest silver, and was imbued with magic so that it can move as good, if not better than his old. All in all, many people were happy to see him escape the clutches of death. Especially none other than the advisor Juliette Forthwight, and Evie Fayre. \n\n\nRoy was happy to be appointed students to train in the magical arts. A little known secret to nobody, not even Juliette, was that the queen herself was a student of his after dark. \n\n\nNo, no, no. Nothing improper was going on between the two of them. \n\n\nRoy was simply just amazing at magic. And through conversations, Sophia had found out he was younger than her. By a few months, but it was something to keep in mind. \n\n\nCurrently, she had enough aptitude to create one spell. \n\n\nThat was one more than she could ever do before.\n\n\nThere was still Caspar, who may or may not be dead. She had sent delegates weeks ago to the Holt Kingdom, it wouldn’t be long until they\u0027ve returned with the much needed information that she would need to make her next move.\n\n\n\"Queen Nevermore, the delegates have returned.\" It\u0027s the voice of one of her assistants that tells her this information. \n\n\nThe days in which only Juliette alerted her to such things had long been gone, as the woman had her only responsibilities that took her away from her side even more. Sophia had a feeling that although even she was away from her, she was working as efficiently as ever to re-join her side. She looks forward to being able to recount the different experiences of their day, but first there was pressing business to attend to. \n\n\n\"I\u0027ll be right there,\" Sophia responds as she pushes herself away from her study. \n\n\n---\n\n\n\"We weren’t able to make contact with Caspar Holt, or the king, Eldred Holt. The man that is the acting king is the father of the king, Reginald Holt. He has requested that you travel out to personally meet him, so that he could supplement our forces with his!\" The delegate recounts. \n\n\nThere are excited murmurs that make up the sound of the room as Sophia thinks deeply on this. Why had no contact with either Caspar, or even his father have been unable to be made? \n\n\nSo many elements to worry about, and did she really have to worry about them? \n\n\nAt this point, Sophia Nevermore feels like she\u0027s more than proven that she could handle her own against anynoe that feels to take advantage of her. But another element that leaves her at a loss of just what to do exactly with this information is that she doesn\u0027t believe her older Noel or Rosemary would ever outright attack her. \n\n\nThey\u0027ve only shown her kindness throughout her life. None of their troops had sent warnings of a war. But still, there were so many questions left unanswered.\n\n\nTo find those answers, she would have to take the path of most resistant. \n\n\nEven after absorbing everything her recently departed siblings had to offer. Their funds, military, strength, infrastructure, she was sure that Noel and Rosemary had more in bulk. \n\n\nThe two of them was always so clever. Was she ready to risk life and limb again, or was there a different path she could take? \n"
