With a kingdom in shambles, and a crown too heavy in the weight of both responsibility and sin, someone must acquiesce the throne. But what can one princess do?\nUpdate: Taking ninjapitka\u0027s very helpful and wonderful comment in mind, I\u0027ve went back to this story to iron out many of the typos that were present in the first publishing. So I want to thank him for basically allowing me to bring a hopefully improved story-game here for you all to experience. However, there still might be some that are present. If so, feel free to point them out in a comment or message me directly if you feel the want/need. In any case, I hope any potential enjoyment isn\u0027t too badly affected, and that this is something that can be found fun in some capacity. Thank you to ninjapitka again, and whoever reads this.\nUpdate #2: The story-game is in the progress of being proofread and fixed up a bit. A special thank you to Tim36D for sitting down and giving me a list to follow for these corrections. \nAuthor Notes:\nThis story is a contest entry for EndMaster\u0027s Dark Fantasy Edge lord contest 2. I wouldnâ€™t call the protagonist in this instance an edgelord, but the story does have some rather dark themes to say the least.\nFoolish Princess has three endings that you can receive. There\u0027s one that is honesty pretty normal. One that can be considered the \u0027bad\u0027 ending. And there\u0027s a \u0027true\u0027 ending that can be reached as well. \nI hope you all enjoy it. "]
