["78","American Outlaws: The Wild Bunch","Will11","6","4","6.62","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/American_Outlaws_0x3a__The_Wild_Bunch.aspx","They were dueling Doolin-Dalton / High or low it was the same / Easy money and faithless women / Red eye whiskey for the pain.\nGo down Bill Dalton, it must be God\u0027s will / Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville / Two voices call you from where they stood / Lay down your law books now, they\u0027re no damn good.\nBetter keep on moving Doolin-Dalton / Till your shadow sets you free / If you\u0027re fast and if you\u0027re lucky / you will never see that hanging tree.\n\nWith a pistol in each hand, your horse\u0027s hooves drumming beneath you, the incessant bangs and whizzes of gunshots all around you, the shouts of angry men and the screams of the injured and dying ringing in your ears you roam the towns, plains and wilderness of the American Old West with your fellow outlaws: the daring Dalton boys, the King of the Oklahoma Outlaws Bill Doolin and all the other members of The Wild Bunch.\n\nYour mission is to get rich or die trying and if you are very clever and very lucky you might just live to enjoy your ill-gotten gains; if not... a weather-beaten cross in a dusty cemetery and your rusting pistol in a 21st century museum next to an old black and white photo of a bullet-riddled body will be your fate!\n\n\nAuthor\u0027s Note: Following the (for me) surprisingly positive feedback on The James Gang I\u0027ve decided to write the next story I had planned in that series, putting The CYS Challenge and Magellan 5 on hold for now. With a new cast of larger-than-life characters, more epic gunfights and daring robberies like it\u0027s predecessor this is the sort of story too unbelievable for fiction and absolutely incredible for being true! I sincerely hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it :)"]
