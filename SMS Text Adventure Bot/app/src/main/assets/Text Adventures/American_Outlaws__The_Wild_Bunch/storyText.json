Rifles explode into life, hitting and killing the two men while more Texas Rangers fire at you but you are already down the alleyway and out of sight, darting left and right through a tangle of alleys you finally emerge onto a street where an unattended horse is tied to a railing. Quickly untying it you jump onto it\u0027s back and race down the street, quickly and escape from town.\n\nIt takes you a week to make it back to the Indian Territory by horse and train and by the time you arrive it is too late: lawmen have tracked down and killed your brother Bill. You are now the last of the Dalton Brothers free and alive and your grief is overwhelming. You spend the rest of the year in hiding before emerging and reuniting with Bill Doolin and your remaining outlaw companions the following spring.\n",

Unfortunately the area before the valley is heavily wooded and provides ideal cover for a posse of lawmen advancing on your position. The first thing you know of the ambush is when a dozen rifles fire. You and Tulsa Jack are both shot through and fall to the ground dead or dying. It might be some consolation to know that your sacrifices alerted your companions and enabled them to escape.\n\nYour Outlaw Career is at an end.\n",

Bill Doolin looks more haggard and older than you remember him, he, Bitter Creek and Dynamite Dick are all in pain from previous bullet wounds. Charley, always silent seems even more solemn than usual, Red Buck sits and scowls, Little Bill looks nervous, Little Dick is silent and even the usually cheerful Tulsa Jack seems quiet and withdrawn.\n\nThe death of your brother has led everyone to put their past differences behind them and this spring day Bill leads the gang to rob a train: boarding it at Dover Little Bill and Little Dick take the driver hostage and make him stop the train while you, Bill, Bitter Creek and Charley empty the express carriage. The robbery goes smoothly and mounting up you ride away to find you have escaped with just $1,000, making your share $100.\n\nYou ride all day until you reach a rocky valley where you decide to rest. Bill asks for someone to keep watch while the rest of the gang sleeps and Tulsa Jack volunteers to do it. You are not sure if one sentry is enough.\n",

  "page 126": "You join the others in resting and soon drift off to sleep. You are woken suddenly by a volley of rifle shots and springing to your feet you are startled to see Tulsa Jack lying dead on some rocks above you. You and your companions spring to your feet, climb quickly onto your horses and gallop away from the valley, escaping the posse of lawmen closing in on you.\n\nBill is very shook by the death of his friend and is certain that the rest of you should all split up and hide out in different locations for at least a year to elude the lawmen who are hunting you. Bill decides to go to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, Bitter Creek and Charley choose to hide out at the ranch of some friends in Payne, Indian Territory, Dynamite Dick is going to Dallas, Texas, Red Buck is going to hide with a friend in Arapho, Indian Territory, Little Dick is going to stay with some friends in Woodward, Indian Territory and Little Bill is going to hide out in a cabin in Pawhuskie, Indian Territory. You need to choose who you will go with.\n\nAs you glance around at your companions you are startled to see, for the first time, fear and uncertainty in their eyes. It is an undeniable fact that of the twenty-one men who have ridden with you in the Wild Bunch thus far eleven are dead and three are in prison leaving just your seven companions. Of your five brothers you are the one not dead or in prison. As your fame increases and lawmen become increasingly determined to bring you in dead or alive (the former preferable) it seems that the writing is on the wall...\n\nYou should choose your companion or companions carefully.\n",
  "page 129": "You spend the next month riding with Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce to the ranch of their friends, the Dunn brothers. Bitter Creek is friendly and chatty, only wincing occasionally from his wounds. Charley is as silent as ever. As you approach the Dunn ranch the five Dunn brothers come out to meet you. You greet them cheerfully.\n\nThe Dunn boys respond by drawing pistols from their pockets and firing at you and your friends. You have a split second to make a decision on what to do.\n",
  "page 128": "You and Bill Doolin hide out in Eureka Springs, Arkansas where your gregarious companion keeps you company. In Eureka Springs you read about how your friends Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce were betrayed and killed by alleged friends of theirs for the reward money while Little Bill is shot and captured after being tracked down by lawmen. The forces of justice are closing in.\n\nLittle Bill still occasionally suffers from pain in his foot that got shot three years ago and intends to go to the bathhouse in Eureka Springs to see if the waters there can help soothe the pain. You are worried it might be too dangerous for both of you to go into the heart of the busy town but Bill points out that you are in Arkansas where the Wild Bunch has never been active and you should be perfectly safe.\n",
  "page 77": "Your narrow escape has shaken all of you and for the next few days you put as much distance as you can between yourselves and Ingalls; you also read in newspapers about the ambush. It seems that fourteen lawmen planned to arrest you all in Ingalls but the gunfight was triggered prematurely when Bitter Creek encountered one. Three lawman and a civilian (who was accidentally shot by the lawmen) were killed and Bitter Creek, Dynamite Dick and two more civilians were all wounded by the lawmen, Bitter Creek in the leg and Dynamite Dick in the hand, losing two of his fingers.\n\nWorse of all Arkansas Tom was trapped in the hotel and captured, found guilty of murder in the next few months he receives a life imprisonment. The loss of your companion and your own narrow escape prompts you all to lie low in the winter, you hide out with Bitter Creek and Dynamite Dick, helping them recover from their wounds.\n\nAt the start of 1894 you reunite and Bill Doolin turns up with two new gang members he has recruited: Richard West and William Raidler who are promptly named Little Dick and Little Bill due to their physical resemblances to Dynamite Dick and Bill Doolin. Little Bill doesn\u0027t impress you much but Little Dick, a rather wild looking man, is a good pistol shot.\n\nBy now you are the most famous outlaw gang in America, notoriously well-known as The Wild Bunch and are now ten members strong. Bill Doolin and your brother Bill Dalton have emerged as the co-leaders of the gang and have come up with a plan.\n\n\"There are so many of us we should split into two groups and rob banks in different states,\" Bill Doolin announces. \"We\u0027ll hit a bank here in Pawnee first and then split into two groups and rob banks in Missouri and Texas. The Indian Territory is getting more and more lawmen in it all the time and if we want to stay ahead of them we need to start branching out into other states.\" All of the gang is enthusiastic about robbing the bank in Pawnee.\n\nOne winter\u0027s morning you ride into the little town with the rest of the gang and leaving Little Bill and Little Dick to guard the horses you all walk straight into the bank. You find just one old man inside who is rather bemused when you all produce your guns and demand he empty the vault. He returns with a small bundle of bills, $100 in all. Apparently the bank is facing fore-closure and all of it\u0027s funds have been moved elsewhere. Angry and humiliated there is nothing you can do but take the money, walk out, mount up and ride off.\n",
  "page 76": "You and your companions head down the street to the town saloon where the owner Murray is an old friend of Bill Doolin. You all order drinks and have barely sat down before you hear the unmistakable sound of gunshots from the street. Springing to your feet you all glance out the window and see several lawmen armed with pistols and rifles running towards the saloon.\n\n\"Quick, the back door!\" Murray yells. \"I\u0027ll cover you!\"\n\nWithout hesitation and with your brother Bill leading the way you all run out of the back door, cut down an alley to the stable and race inside. There are dozens of horses inside and each of you chooses one while gunfire rages outside as the lawmen trade shots with Murray. Once you are all mounted and ready Bill Doolin throws open the stable doors and you all charge out.\n\nThe lawmen are taken completely by surprise as you and your companions burst out of the stable onto main street: they were all still firing at the saloon or at the hotel where Arkansas Tom is sniping at them with a rifle. Two lawmen are close to the stable and fire at you all, one bullet hits your brother Bill\u0027s horse in the head and it falls to the ground, your brother jumping clear just in time. Turning around with his pistol in his hand he fires a shot that hits the lawman in the chest. You and Bill Doolin both pull the reins of your horses and turn around as your brother runs towards you.\n\n\"I\u0027ll get him,\" Bill shouts to you. \"Cover me.\"\n",
  "page 79": "You have no intention of lingering and racing down the stairs you slip unnoticed out the back door of the hotel and flee on foot out of town. The sound of gunshots continue to ring out for several minutes until you are aware of the thudding of horse hooves - glancing back your heart gives a thrill of delight as you see your companions Bill Doolin and Bill Dalton (riding the same horse), Charley Pierce, Red Buck, Dynamite Dick and Tulsa Jack all galloping towards you. Charley slows so you can jump onto his horse and you ride on. Looking back you can see lawmen have surrounded the hotel where Arkansas Tom is still firing from the windows and it seems that your companion is lost.\n",
  "page 78": "You join Arkansas Tom at the window, grab one of his rifle\u0027s and peer down for a target. You spot one: a young lawman sheltering behind a tree with his side exposed to you. You take careful aim and fire, your bullet hitting the man in the left side, passing through his body and blasting out his right. The man falls down and doesn\u0027t get up again.\n\nSuddenly your brother Bill, Bill Doolin, Charley, Red Buck, Tulsa Jack and Dynamite Dick all burst from the town\u0027s stables mounted on horses. The lawmen, who are still firing at the saloon, scramble around to fire at them, hitting your brother Bill\u0027s horse in the head. Bill jumps from the saddle, turns, shoots a lawman dead and scrambles onto the back of Bill Doolin\u0027s horse. You watch as your friends escape.\n\nThe lawmen now turn their attention to you and begin firing up at the window, forcing you and Arkansas Tom away from it. You hear running feet on the stairs outside the hotel door and then bullets begin to hit the door, forcing you to take shelter under the bed. You are both trapped and have no way of escaping.\n\n\"We surrender,\" Arkansas Tom shouts loudly.\n\nThe shooting stops, there is a pause, and then suddenly the hotel door spectacularly explodes inwards in a blinding flash of light that brings down the roof, burying you both helplessly beneath the rubble, your guns lost in the chaos. Several armed lawmen race through the ruins their dynamite created and quickly capture you both.\n\nIt is some consolation to you that your companions all succeeded in escaping, though both Bitter Creek and Dynamite Dick were wounded in all the gunfire. You and Arkansas Tom are not so lucky, you are both quickly tried and convicted for the deaths of three lawman and one civilian who were killed in the gunfight and both of you are sentenced to terms of life imprisonment.\n\nIt seems that your outlaw careers are over but then, after a few years, fate reunites you with your companions.\n",
  "page 70": "You and Ol agree to try your different plans and while Ol walks out the front door you open a back window and climb out. Cautiously you jog towards some nearby trees, expecting a bullet to be fired at you at any moment. You nearly jump out of your skin when a gunshot rings out but when it is almost instantly followed by several more you realize the shots are coming from the front of the house. Escaping the area you rejoin your companions in Ingalls where you learn your worst fears are correct: Ol Yantis was shot dead by the lawmen he tried to fight. You hide out in Ingalls until the following summer when The Wild Bunch rides again.\n\n\nIn the last six months you and your fellow outlaws have recruited four new gang members, bringing your gang strength up to nine. There is Dynamite Dick, an explosives expert with an impressive nickname, Red Buck, a grim and dour man, Tulsa Jack, a good friend of Bill Doolin\u0027s and Arkansas Tom, a sharp-shooting well-dressed young man. Together the nine of you plan your first robbery in Kansas and in the summer of 1893 you strike.\n\n\nOne summer morning the nine of you board a train at Cimarron in Kansas and while the new recruits get the driver to stop the train and Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce guard the passengers you and the two Bill\u0027s make your way to the Express Carriage. You calmly empty the safe before you all dismount, run to your horses, mount up and ride away. On the ride you count the money you have stolen and find you have gotten away with $1,000, making your share $100.\n\n\nUnfortunately you do not get clean away, that afternoon as you are resting a posse of lawmen suddenly gallop over a nearby ridge. All of your mount up and firing pistols and rifles at each other you and your pursuers engage in a running battle for over a mile. There are no casualties on either side except Bill Doolin who is unlucky enough to be shot in the foot by a rifle shell, a painful but non-serious wound. Easily escaping the nine of you ride back to Ingalls unaware that an even deadlier enemy is in pursuit...\n",

Following you is Bitter Creek and his mute companion Charley Pierce while the newer recruits bunch together, Tulsa Jack is exchanging jokes with Dynamite Dick while Red Buck rides on in silence and Arkansas Tom cradles his rifle. You are as dangerous an outlaw gang as any that roamed the West.\n\nIn town you agree to split up: Arkansas Tom is tired and is going over to the little community\u0027s hotel to sleep. Bitter Creek offers to saddle all the horses in the stable while the rest of the gang head into a saloon operated by your friend Murray. You need to choose who to follow.\n",

The man halts as he catches sight of you and in a flash all three of you go for your guns.\nThe Lawman fires first, hitting your companion in the leg. Bitter Creek yells as you fire, narrowly missing the man who dives for cover. Suddenly you notice several men with guns in their hands running towards you both from all directions.\n\"Ride!\" you shout to Bitter Creek and with pistols exploding into life behind you the pair of you spur your horses down the main street, bullets zipping by. You do not stop riding until you are well out of town when you finally turn back to see what is happening.\nThe whole town seems alive with gunfire, bodies are lying in the street as lawmen shelter behind cover and fire pistols and rifles. As you watch Bill Dalton, Bill Doolin, Charlie, Tulsa Jack, Dynamite Dick and Red Buck, all mounted, burst out of the stable and spur stolen horses down the street, firing their pistols. Even as you watch Bill Dalton\u0027s horse is shot in the head and collapses spectacularly, your brother jumps from the saddle, lands on his feet, turns and shoots the lawman who killed his horse. Bill Doolin reins in and your brother runs towards him, throws himself onto the back of his horse and they gallop on.

By the summer of 1896 only you, Dynamite Dick and Little Dick remain at large.\n\nYour friend is an intelligent and cautious man but one summer day you both let your guard down and risk a shopping trip in Dallas.

Dynamite Dick hesitates and then complies.\n",

In the cabin you both lie low for a few weeks until one fateful day you are both sitting inside one night when you hear a voice shout out \"We have the cabin surrounded! Come out with your hands up and no one will get hurt.\" \"It\u0027s the law!\" Bill hisses as you both jump to your feet.\n\nThere are only two ways out of the cabin: the front door and a small back window. Bill snatches up both of his pistols, cocks them and approaches the door. \"I\u0027m going to give them something to remember me by,\" he mutters to you.\n",

The first is a middle-aged man with a distinctive black gunpowder burn on his left cheek while his companion is shorter, handsome man with an impressive moustache. \"Boys, let me introduce you to Black Face Charley Bryant and Bitter Creek George Newcomb,\" Bob declares. Greetings are exchanged all round as you leave the station.\n\n\n\"Black Face and Bitter Creek were with me and Emmett in that little caper down in New Mexico that got us all written up as Outlaws,\" Bob explains to you. \"I\u0027ve been thinking boys that it was time to show this country what real outlaws are like. We\u0027ve already held up one train in California and I plan to hit more here in the Territory where they haven\u0027t got any real law; just miles and miles of wilderness to hide in and train lines running through it like arteries for us to cut. What do you boys reckon?\"\n\n\n\"After we read in the papers you boys were behind that hold up in California we were kind of hoping you would turn up with that exact offer,\" Bitter Creek declares with a grin. Black Face just grunts.\n\n\nOn the first day of May the five of you board a train at Wharton. While Black Face and Bitter Creek go to capture the driver and stop the train you, Bob and Emmett head straight to the Express Carriage. Catching the Guard by surprise you disarm him at gunpoint and empty the safe. As the train slows to a halt you jump off and race to a nearby copse of trees where you have left horses waiting, joined by your companions. Once you have ridden a safe distance you count the money and find you have stolen some $1700, making your share $300. It\u0027s not much but it\u0027s a start.\n\n\n\"Well boys it\u0027s not millions but the Territory isn\u0027t a wealthy place,\" Bob says thoughtfully. \"I reckon it\u0027s best if we split up. Bitter Creek, did you say you had some friends over in Hutchinson, Kansas? I reckon that sounds like a safe spot for us.\" Black Face coughs. \"I reckon I\u0027m sick boys,\" he tells the rest of you. \"Got this damn cough that won\u0027t go away so I reckon I\u0027d best get into Hutchinson here in the Territory and see a doctor I trust. Drop me a line when you want me and I\u0027ll join you boys again.\" Bob nods and you ponder who to join.\n",
  "page 145": "You join Dynamite Dick in Texas where you read in newspapers of the steady destruction of the Wild Bunch in the year after the Dover Train Robbery. First Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce are betrayed and killed by turncoat friends, then Little Bill is shot and arrested in the Territory and Bill Doolin is arrested in Arkansas; finally Red Buck is shot and killed by lawmen. By the summer of 1896 only you, Dynamite Dick and Little Dick remain at large.\n\nYour friend is an intelligent and cautious man but one summer day you both let your guard down and risk a shopping trip in Dallas. You are walking down the street when you are confronted by a lone lawman with a pair of pistols trained on the pair of you. He orders you to slowly raise your hands and surrender. Dynamite Dick hesitates and then complies.\n",
  "page 5": "Bob crosses to the open train door, raises his pistol, holds his breath while he takes careful aim and squeezes off a single shot. As the gun smoke rises he leans forward, peers into the darkness and draws back into the carriage. \"I\u0027ve killed him,\" he says to the rest of you who stand there in stunned silence. After a few seconds Bob mutters \"come on\" and leads you all down the train.\n\n\nHiding your guns in your pockets you pass through the passenger cars, people looking at you curiously but perhaps sensing who you are no one interferes with you until you come to the corridor that leads to the express carriage. Bob has just started to open the door when a shot is fired, the bullet striking the thick wooden door. You all jump back immediately and Bob pulls the door shut again. There is a moment\u0027s silence then more shots are fired, the bullets striking the door in front of you.\n\n\n\"We\u0027d better clear out of here,\" Bill mutters to the rest of you. \"That express guard is armed.\" Bob thinks for a moment and swears. \"We should have brought some dynamite,\" he mutters. \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Grat says quickly. \"The alarm is raised now boys, let\u0027s clear out.\"\n\n\nYou open a door and one by one you all jump off the train and run down the embankment. You have left five horses tethered in a copse of trees nearby and reach them after a swift five minutes run. Mounting up you ride off south. The robbery has been a complete failure: an engineer has been killed and you have been forced to flee without a single dollar. It is not an impressive debut.\n\n\nNews travels fast and by the time you make it back to San Francisco where Bill lives the news is in all the morning newspapers that an engineer was murdered on a South Pacific Train last night by a desperate gang of train robbers. You keep to Bill\u0027s house all day, each of you lost in your own thoughts about what to do now. The tension drags on until evening when after dinner Bob finally addresses the problem.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve been thinking and I reckon it\u0027d be a lot safer if we all headed back to the Indian Territory,\" he says. \"We know it well and I don\u0027t reckon the law will find us there.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve got a law career here in California Bob,\" Bill says angrily. \"You forget, only you and Emmett are currently wanted for anything: Grat, Daniel and I aren\u0027t known to the law yet.\"\n\n\n\"How long do you think that will last with posses tracking us for the Alila Robbery?\" Bob demands.\n\n\nAn argument rages for the next few hours until it ends with Grat siding with Bill and both choosing to lie low in California while Bob and Emmett head back to the Indian Territory to hide out there until the heat dies down. What you\u0027ll do after a few months isn\u0027t discussed and you need to choose which pair of brothers to join.\n",
  "page 144": "You and Bill Doolin hide out in Eureka Springs, Arkansas where your gregarious companion keeps you company. In Eureka Springs you read about how your friends Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce were betrayed and killed by alleged friends of theirs for the reward money while Little Bill is shot and captured after being tracked down by lawmen. The forces of justice are closing in.\n\nLittle Bill still occasionally suffers from pain in his foot that got shot three years ago and intends to go to the bathhouse in Eureka Springs to see if the waters there can help soothe the pain. You are worried it might be too dangerous for both of you to go into the heart of the busy town but Bill points out that you are in Arkansas where the Wild Bunch has never been active and you should be perfectly safe.\n",

  "page 147": "You join Little Dick in Woodward, an untidy and humourless figure you don\u0027t much enjoy your time with him. You are saddened to read in papers of the murders of Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce following a betrayal by alleged friends of theirs and of the arrest of Little Bill after he is tracked down and shot by lawmen. There are only you and four other members of the Wild Bunch at large now.\n\nLittle Dick introduces you to three friends of his: brothers called John, Frank and Al Jennings. John is a lawyer but Al wants to be an outlaw, he is enthralled by your tales of your hold-ups. Woodward is a sleepy little town but it has it\u0027s difficulties: the Jennings brothers are embroiled in a feud with a rival lawyer called Temple Houston.\n\nOne night you are sitting in the town\u0027s saloon chatting with John and Frank when Houston walks in and an argument between your companions and the dapper young lawyer ensures. Almost without warning everyone goes for their guns and before you can act Houston has drawn and shot both John and Frank. As your two companions fall to the floor the lawyer, his pistol still smoking, glances at you.\n\n\"This disagreement has nothing to do with you friend,\" he tells you.\n",

You, Grat and Bill settle down and mostly stay in the house, only Bill leaves to see to his law work. One night you are all talking in the kitchen when there is a knock on the front door. Bill goes to answer it and suddenly you hear yells and the sound of a scuffle. You and Grat spring to your feet as several armed policemen burst into the kitchen.\n\n\nYou have two choices. There is an open window in the kitchen overlooking an alleyway which you could run to and jump through, though it is perilously narrow or there is a second open door behind you that leads through to the dining room through which a back door leads into a yard that opens out onto a street, though it may be guarded.

  "page 0": "Your name is Daniel Dalton, you were born in 1870 and by 1890 you were a Lawman in the Old West. You arrested law breakers and helped keep the peace. You were a good man. You always knew you would be a good man because your five brothers were good men: Frank was a lawman in Arkansas, Grat was a lawman in Oklahoma and Bob was a lawman in Kansas. Another brother Bill was a lawyer in California, fighting for justice in the courts. You and your younger brother Emmett were Special Policemen in the Indian Territory. You were all good people.\n\n\nBut somehow everything went wrong.\n\n\nIt began when you were seventeen and your oldest brother Frank was killed in a gunfight with a gang of outlaws. It inspired you and your brothers to become Lawmen and you all served bravely, at one time Grat was shot in the arm by outlaws while during his service Bob killed two wanted men at different times. Despite this word began to spread that the Dalton Boys were no good, crooked lawmen horse stealing and making money on the side. Perhaps the fact that your cousins were the Youngers didn\u0027t help.\n\n\nBrothers Cole, Jim, John and Bob Younger had once rode with Jesse James and his legendary gang of outlaws. John had been killed and the others captured and put in prison after a gunfight. You and your brothers tried to have as little to do with them as possible but when you were nineteen Bob Younger died in prison of tuberculosis.You and your brothers traveled to Minnesota State Penitentiary to attend the funeral and on a cold autumn evening you and your cousins gathered in the prison cemetery.\n\n\nJim did not say a word to any of you but Cole, a tough veteran of fifteen bullet wounds, walked over after the service to say a few words to you and your brothers.When he learns that you are lawmen he reacts with horror. \"Our family have never been no Yankee lawmen,\" he tells you tersely. \"Law in the South is nothing more than what the rich Republicans in Washington say is the law. Don\u0027t be their bloodhounds and lapdogs boys, it is far better to be the fox!\"\n\n\nA few months after this meeting Bob and Emmett are fired from their jobs for illegally selling alcohol to Native Americans. Depressed they go traveling down to New Mexico where they get into a crooked card game with a gang of tinhorn gamblers: realizing they are being cheated they pull out their pistols and take their money back at gunpoint. For this they are posted up as wanted men: outlaws. Days later you and Grat are fired and arrested on charges of horse stealing, though the charges soon fall through for lack of evidence.\n\n\nFeeling victimized you and your brothers all head out to California to see your brother Bill. Bill is having problems of his own: he has been dismissed from the California State Legislature for opposing the large railway companies, who have been using armies of hired gunmen to bully farmers and ranches into selling their land to them cheaply so they can build their railroads. As you gather at Bill\u0027s house to celebrate New Year\u0027s Day 1891 the mood is dark.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s time for a change boys,\" Bob declares. \"We\u0027ve been treated unfairly in honest work because some of our family were outlaws. We\u0027ve been cheated and abused and when we\u0027ve stood up for ourselves we\u0027ve been labeled outlaws too. Cole is right: it\u0027s all the fault of the big businesses: the banks and the railroads who do everything they can to take the money of honest men and leave them with nothing but empty promises. The only way not to be part of this system is to live outside the law... all the way.\"\n\n\nGrat looks uncertain, with Frank dead he is now the oldest brother but he is more of a follower than a leader. \"That\u0027s a hell of a decision to make Bob,\" he says quietly. \"Grat look at us!\" Bob exclaims. \"You have shed blood and we\u0027ve all lost a brother for the law and that same law says we our outlaws! Well I say it\u0027s time we started living up to our reputation.\"\n\n\nBill frowns thoughtfully, ambitious and determined he and Bob are natural rivals. \"If we do this there\u0027s no going back Bob. Think on that.\"\n\n\nBob nods, a young man and a crack shot with a rifle or a pistol he is the most outspoken of you all. \"Then we\u0027ll just have to be the best outlaws there ever was,\" he declares with a grin.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m with you Bob,\" Emmett declares. He is the youngest and he has always idolized Bob and always tries to follow in his footsteps.\n\n\n\"Ok,\" you say quietly. At your hips you wear two matching Colt Pistols which once belonged to your brother Frank. Silent but resolute you have the gift of earning respect from others by your actions. \"We will be the Dalton Gang then and begin our new life from today.\"\n\n\nYour Outlaw story is about to begin.\n",

Arkansas Tom, a lean and pale outlaw the same age as you, has a proposition.\n\n\"I miss the outlaw life and begin rich,\" he tells you. \"I got sent to prison for seventeen years for a train robbery that netted me $100 and for killing a Deputy Marshal. I want to earn something for the years I\u0027ve served. I want to rob the town bank. Will you help me do this? For old time\u0027s sake? Bill Doolin and all the boys would be proud of us.\"\n\nYou consider his suggestion, it would mean a return to your life of crime after some twenty years but is it worth it?\n",

For nearly two years you evade capture, thinking constantly that it is incredible that the small amount that you stole can be worth such pursuit.\n\nFinally the Territory Legislature have had enough and make a remarkable offer: if you will surrender yourself then all charges against you will be dropped. As long as you promise to live a peaceful life then you will not be harmed. It is the best offer you are going to get and on the last day of 1899 you meet the Governor in Oklahoma City and surrender.\n\nIt is over and you have beaten them.\n\nFOR ELUDING THE FORCES OF JUSTICE SUCCESSFULLY YOU HAVE EARNED A BONUS SCORE OF 10,000.\n",

You can do nothing but surrender your weapons. Considering the circumstances you and Arkansas Tom are lucky to get off with sentences of four year imprisonment.

Bill remains optimistic, confident that his own skills as a lawyer, contradictions in the testimony of witnesses on the train and your own previous good reputations will exonerate you. Grat is less sanguine and urges that you join him in trying to escape from prison and heading out across America to go and join Bob, Emmett and their gang in the Indian Territory.

Running on foot you manage to reach the city\u0027s train station ten minutes later and catch the first train heading out of town. Sending off telegrams ahead you arrange to meet Bob and Emmett on the way.\n\n\nDays later, after taking trains across Nevada, Utah and Colorado you rejoin Bob and Emmett. By this time you have read in the papers that Bill and Grat have both been arrested back in California and charged with train robbery. You are all concerned by the news but Bob points out there is nothing you can do about it until you have some money so he arranges a meeting with two of his old friends in the Indian Territory.\n\n\nAt the little community of Wharton you find two men waiting at the train station for you. The first is a middle-aged man with a distinctive black gunpowder burn on his left cheek while his companion is shorter, handsome man with an impressive moustache. \"Boys, let me introduce you to Black Face Charley Bryant and Bitter Creek George Newcomb,\" Bob declares. Greetings are exchanged all round as you leave the station.\n\n\n\"Black Face and Bitter Creek were with me and Emmett in that little caper down in New Mexico that got us all written up as Outlaws,\" Bob explains to you. \"I\u0027ve been thinking boys that it was time to show this country what real outlaws are like. We\u0027ve already held up one train in California and I plan to hit more here in the Territory where they haven\u0027t got any real law; just miles and miles of wilderness to hide in and train lines running through it like arteries for us to cut. What do you boys reckon?\"\n\n\n\"After we read in the papers you boys were behind that hold up in California we were kind of hoping you would turn up with that exact offer,\" Bitter Creek declares with a grin. Black Face just grunts.\n\n\nOn the first day of May the five of you board a train at Wharton. While Black Face and Bitter Creek go to capture the driver and stop the train you, Bob and Emmett head straight to the Express Carriage. Catching the Guard by surprise you disarm him at gunpoint and empty the safe. As the train slows to a halt you jump off and race to a nearby copse of trees where you have left horses waiting, joined by your companions. Once you have ridden a safe distance you count the money and find you have stolen some $1700, making your share $300. It\u0027s not much but it\u0027s a start.\n\n\n\"Well boys it\u0027s not millions but the Territory isn\u0027t a wealthy place,\" Bob says thoughtfully. \"I reckon it\u0027s best if we split up. Bitter Creek, did you say you had some friends over in Hutchinson, Kansas? I reckon that sounds like a safe spot for us.\" Black Face coughs. \"I reckon I\u0027m sick boys,\" he tells the rest of you. \"Got this damn cough that won\u0027t go away so I reckon I\u0027d best get into Hutchinson here in the Territory and see a doctor I trust. Drop me a line when you want me and I\u0027ll join you boys again.\" Bob nods and you ponder who to join.\n",
  "page 13": "You and Bill spend your time researching court cases and preparing for your trial, not helped by the fact that Grat makes a spectacular escape from custody by jumping through the window of a moving train and Bob and Emmett\u0027s gang in the Indian Territory rob another train. Notwithstanding these facts at the trial you and Bill absolutely shine, casting doubt on every single witness testimony from the train and illustrating countless cases when bloodhound tracking proved unreliable and misleading. It surprises no one when both of you are acquitted by the Jury after a short deliberation.\n\n\nYou and Bill celebrate in San Francisco and Bill makes plans to rebuild his shattered career as a lawyer when a telegram arrives from Bob congratulating you both on your good luck and telling you that Grat has succeeded in joining him and Emmett in the Indian Territory. He invites you and Bill to join him and his gang to for Christmas and New Year and with much reluctance you both make your way out to Indian Territory to meet your outlaw brothers.\n",
  "page 12": "You and Grat plan your escape attempts and make no effort to defend yourselves at trial, which results in you both being found guilty of train robbery and being sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Put on a train bound for San Quentin and guarded by two armed deputies you see your chance to escape when one of your guards falls asleep and the other becomes engrossed in a conversation with a pretty lady sitting next to him.\n\n\nMoving with infinite care you lean forward, deftly remove the handcuff key from the sleeping guard\u0027s trouser pocket, undo your handcuffs and pass it to Grat to free himself. As the train passes over a bridge you both suddenly spring up, punch out the train window next to you and first you, then Grat throw yourselves through it to the astonishment of your guards. Falling through the air you both hit the water as the train rushes by above you.\n\n\nSwimming quickly to the shore, elated at your daring escape you set off cross-country. Stealing horses and robbing country folk along the way you manage to make it to the Indian Territory after a month long series of adventures. On the way you learn that Bill has been acquitted of all the charges against him thanks to his fantastic skills as a lawyer. As the year 1891 you, your brothers and Bob and Emmett\u0027s gang gather for a meeting in the Indian Territory.\n",

  "page 26": "Bill departs and the rest of you lie low for six months before making your move: one summer evening the nine of you ride into the little community of Red Rock and wait on the platform. Soon enough a train arrives but this one has all it\u0027s lights off and passes right by the platform without stopping, a very unusual thing. The next train does stop and you all climb aboard; while the others take care of the driver and passengers you and your brothers go to the Express Carriage.\n\n\nYou take the Express Guard hostage and go to rob the safe, only to discover there isn\u0027t one. Angrily you ask the Guard where all the money is.\n\n\n\"There isn\u0027t any,\" the terrified man replies nervously. \"The Southern Pacific have changed their policy because so many of their trains were robbed last year... now only Express Trains carry money and they\u0027re all heavily guarded. The only cash we keep on the Passenger Trains now is petty cash.\"\n\n\nGrat swears angrily but there is nothing you can do but grab the petty cash, about $50 altogether, and leave when the train stops. After riding a safe distance to avoid pursuit a lively debate ensues in the Gang over what to do now: Bill Doolin thinks you all should rob trains outside the Territory while others think you should try robbing banks instead. The discussion ends with Bob declaring you will all try robbing one of these Express Trains in the Territory next month, despite the armed guards the messenger spoke of...\n",
  "page 25": "Saying goodbye to your brothers and the rest of the Gang you decide to go back to San Francisco with Bill. In California Bill struggles to rebuild his law firm but it is difficult for a man whose four brothers are wanted outlaws and who many believe is an outlaw himself. Bill struggles while you hide out in his home for ten months. In the papers you read about your brothers and their Gang robbing two more trains in the Indian Territory, the latter after a daring gunfight.\n\n\nThen comes the news of Coffeyville.\n\n\nBob, Grat and Emmett, together with Bill Power and Dick Broadwell, try to rob two banks at the same time in the city of Coffeyville. The alarm is raised and a massive gunfight breaks out that leaves eight men dead including Bob, Grat, Bill and Dick while Emmett survives despite 23 individual bullet wounds and is imprisoned for life. Your brothers Bob and Grat are dead, their gang destroyed and initially you and Bill are so full of pain you don\u0027t know what to do.\n\n\nYour minds are decided when a telegram arrives from the three surviving gang members who did not go on the Coffeyville Raid: Bitter Creek, Bill Doolin and Charley Pierce. They invite you and Bill to join them and a new Gang they are putting together in the Indian Territory. You and Bill are both in agreement.\n\n\n\"They\u0027ve killed our brothers and now we\u0027re going to make America pay,\" Bill declares. \"Damn the law and damn the banks, I\u0027m going to join these boys and bring hell to Kansas and the Territory. Are you with me Daniel?\"\n\n\n\"I am,\" you tell your brother quietly and the pair of you return to the Indian Territory.\n",
  "page 28": "As the train stops you join Bill and Dick in climbing into the driver\u0027s compartment where you draw your pistols. The driver turns to complain but freezes when he sees your guns, you order him to put his hands up and leaving the other two to guard him you return to the doorway and watch what is happening on the platform. Two male passengers have got off the train while further down the platform seven armed guards have stepped off the train and are walking up and down smoking and stretching their legs.\n\n\nEverything seems to be going like clockwork until the guards turn to get back on the train. A shot is fired, hitting one of them and then pandemonium erupts as gunfire explodes from the train, Both the passengers on the platform and a second guard are hit and fall down as the remaining guards run for cover. From the door of the driving compartment you fire your pistol at the fleeing guards, who take shelter and start to return fire.\n\n\nWhen the guards start firing back you step back inside the driver\u0027s compartment and push the door shut. \"Time to go I think,\" you tell your companions and opening the door on the other side you jump down off the train. Further up you can see your fellow gang members doing likewise and together you race across the tracks, scramble up onto the platform on the other side and flee the station to where you have left your waiting horses, all the while keeping the train safely between you and the armed guards.\n\n\nThe robbery has been a complete success and you have all escaped with $17,000, a great amount which makes your share $2,000. You are all elated until the next day when you read news of the robbery in the papers. Apparently four people were shot during the brief gunfight: two guards and the two male passengers who are both doctors, one of which has died from his wounds. The papers name you and your brothers as the killers and have posted Bounties of $5,000 on each of your heads. Bob is furious.\n\n\n\"What absolute imbeciles shot these two doctors?\" he demands. \"If there is one thing that will make the law come after us now it is this! Who can\u0027t tell the difference between armed guards and a couple of civilians?\"\n\n\nIt transpires that Bitter Creek, Bill Doolin and Charley Pierce were the ones who shot the doctors. Apparently they were in the Passenger Carriage when they heard the gunfire and shot the first people they saw on the platform. Bob angrily attacks them while the three outlaws defend themselves equally furiously.\n\n\n\"I think it\u0027s better we don\u0027t see much of each other for now,\" Bob decides. \"I don\u0027t want you boys in on my next job, go and hide out at Ingalls and I\u0027ll tell you when I want you. Go on, go. I have plans to beat anything Jesse James ever did: we\u0027re going to rob two banks at once in broad daylight in the town of Coffeyville, Kansas. I don\u0027t want you boys to have anything to do with the money we get from this thing, we\u0027ll join you after.\"\n\n\n\"Well that\u0027s just fine Bob,\" Bill Doolin says cooly. \"It sounds too risky anyway.\"\n\n\nFrowning you consider whether to join your brothers in the Coffeyville Raid or lie low with Doolin and the others.\n",
  "page 27": "On the chosen day you all gather at the tiny train station at Pryor Creek to await the arrival of the train. You all have very specific jobs: Bill Power and Dick Broadwell are to board the driver\u0027s compartment immediately and stop him moving the train from the platform. Bitter Creek, Bill Doolin and Charley Pierce are to board the Passenger Carriage and keep everything under control there. Your brothers Bob, Grat and Emmett will board the Express Carriage and try to capture the armed guards before robbing the safe. You need to choose which group you will join.\n",

You read about all the great Depression-Era Public Enemies: John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, Ma Barker and Alvin Karpis, it\u0027s all old news with new faces to you.\n\nYour brother Emmett prospers in California, helping turn your legend as the Dalton boys into books and movies before his death in 1937. Al Jennings does well, transforming himself into the successful outlaw on-screen that he never was in real life before his death in 1961 at the age 98 leaving you the last of the great old-west outlaws.\n\nBy this point you yourself are very old. The world is a different place to how it was: America is locked in a Cold War with Communism, across the Atlantic in the UK people are singing along to a new band called the Beatles and the outlaws you knew and liked have become the subjects of awful Dime Novels and B Movies.\n\nThat was not how it used to be. When you and your brothers the Dalton rode the air was alive with the crack of gunshots, the smell of gunpowder smoke and the screams of the dead and dying. It was a world of cheap whiskey, wild women, bank and train safes stuffed with money and life or death came down to who had the split second reflexes to be faster.\n\nThat\u0027s all gone now... gone but not forgotten.

  "page 45": "You join Bob in the doorway and empty your pistol at the fleeing guards, hitting two of them who fall down onto the platform and lie still. The rest of them reach shelter at various points of the platform and begin firing back, prompting you and Bob to move away from the open door of the Express Carriage: bullets traveling through it hit the wall on the far side of the Carriage. Further down the train you can hear more gunfire as the rest of the Gang fire at the Guards. \"I\u0027ve got the money, let\u0027s go,\" Grat shouts. Throwing open the compartment door that doesn\u0027t face the platform and one by one you all jump down to the ground. Further up the train you can see your fellow gang members doing likewise and together you race across the tracks, scramble up onto the platform on the other side and flee the station to where you have left your waiting horses, all the while keeping the train safely between you and the armed guards.\n\n\nThe robbery has been a complete success and you have all escaped with $17,000, a great amount which makes your share $2,000. You are all elated until the next day when you read news of the robbery in the papers. Apparently four people were shot during the brief gunfight: two guards and the two male passengers who are both doctors, one of which has died from his wounds. The papers name you and your brothers as the killers and have posted Bounties of $5,000 on each of your heads. Bob is furious.\n\n\n\"What absolute imbeciles shot these two doctors?\" he demands. \"If there is one thing that will make the law come after us now it is this! Who can\u0027t tell the difference between armed guards and a couple of civilians?\"\n\n\nIt transpires that Bitter Creek, Bill Doolin and Charley Pierce were the ones who shot the doctors. Bob angrily attacks thethree of them, who defend themselves equally furiously.\n\n\n\"Bill, Bitter Creek, Charley, I think it\u0027s better we don\u0027t see much of each other for now,\" Bob decides. \"I don\u0027t want you boys in on my next job, go and hide out at Ingalls and I\u0027ll tell you when I want you. Go on, go. I have plans to beat anything Jesse James ever did: we\u0027re going to rob two banks at once in broad daylight in the town of Coffeyville, Kansas. I don\u0027t want you boys to have anything to do with the money we get from this thing, we\u0027ll join you after.\"\n\n\n\"Well that\u0027s just fine Bob,\" Bill Doolin says cooly. \"It sounds too risky anyway.\"\n\n\nFrowning you consider whether to join your brothers in the Coffeyville Raid or lie low with Doolin and the others.\n",
  "page 48": "You and your friends go to hide out in the little community of Ingalls and pass the next three months drinking and relaxing, using the money from the Pryor Creek robbery to pay your way. Much of the time you spend with a friend of Bitter Creek\u0027s called Ol Yantis, a softly spoken cotton farmer. The five of you spend your time relaxing and hiding out and for a time there are no worries on your horizons.\n\n\nThen comes the news of Coffeyville.\n\n\nYou read in the newspapers how Bob, Grat and Emmett, together with Bill Power and Dick Broadwell, try to rob two banks at the same time in the city of Coffeyville. The alarm is raised and a massive gunfight breaks out that leaves eight men dead including Bob, Grat, Bill and Dick while Emmett survives despite 23 individual bullet wounds and is imprisoned for life. Your brothers Bob and Grat are dead, Emmett is imprisoned and for a time you are all absolutely stunned, completely unsure what to do.\n\n\nThe deaths of your brothers only commits you further to your life as an outlaw. After sending a telegram to your brother Bill to join you in the Territroy you remain brooding for days. It is finally Bill Doolin who breaks you out of it. \"We\u0027ll show America we\u0027re not done yet,\" he tells you firmly. \"We\u0027ll hit a bank in Carney, we\u0027ll make Bob proud. We\u0027ll keep on and make the Gang he built the best and most famous there ever was.\" Grimly you agree.\n\n\nOne week after your brothers were killed at Coffeyville you and your companions ride into the town of Carney. While Ol guards your horses outside the door the rest of you go inside; Bitter Creek and Charley guard the lone cashier while you and Bill empty the vault before locking the cashier inside and riding off. It is all too easy, a simple robbery that netted the gang $1,500, making your share $300. After receiving a telegram from your brother Bill you ride back to Ingalls to meet him.\n",
  "page 47": "On the chosen day, three months after the Pryor Creek Robbery, you and your five companions ride into the peaceful little town of Coffeyville. You already have a plan: to hitch your horses outside the town\u0027s two banks. While Bob and Emmett enter the first bank Grat, Bill and Dick are to enter the second bank and rob both, lock any staff and customers in the vaults, emerge at roughly the same time, mount up and ride out of town before the alarm is raised.\n\n\nAs you ride into town you are annoyed to see that the hitching posts outside the banks have been taken down for some street work, forcing you to leave your horses in an alleyway close to the banks. As you dismount and walk towards the bank your are uncomfortably aware that a lot of people seem to be glancing at you, heavily armed as you all are with rifles and you with your two pistols. \"Ok boys, move smart and fast,\" Bob mutters. \"Who you joining Dan?\"\n",
  "page 49": "You and your brothers walk confidently into one of the town\u0027s banks to discover three cashiers sitting inside chatting and laughing. The laughter dies from their faces as you, Bob and Emmett draw your pistols and point them at the cashiers. \"This is a hold up,\" you declare. \"Keep silent and no one will be hurt.\" While Emmett guards the cashiers you and Bob swiftly empty the contents of the open vault into a sack. Everything is going according to plan.\n\n\nThen you hear the gunshots.\n\n\nThe windows of the bank you are in crack as bullets pound into them. \"You men in front of us,\" Bob barks, passing the sack of money to Emmett and grabbing a teller. \"We\u0027re going out the front.\" Each of you hold a teller in front of you and move towards the front door but several bullets break the glass, driving you back. \"Out the back,\" Bob yells. \"Quickly!\" Abandoning the tellers the three of you race out a back door and onto the street. The alleyway where you left the horses is some distance away. \"Go quickly boys,\" Bob orders as gunshots continue to ring out all around. \"I\u0027ll cover you.\"\n",
  "page 101": "You remain outside the bank with Charley while the other two go in the bank. Almost immediately there is a gunshot followed by a second gunshot and then Bill and Bitter Creek burst out of the bank doors, the latter bleeding from a bullet wound in his shoulder. \"Go, go, go!\" Bill shouts and the four of you mount up and flee without a dollar.\n\nIt seems that the cashier inside the bank had a pistol in the bank and as soon as your companions drew their weapons he opened fire, hitting Bitter Creek in the shoulder. Bitter Creek fired back, hitting the man in the stomach and then your two companions fled. The robbery attempt has been a complete failure.\n\nBitter Creek\u0027s injury is serious and having been shot for the second time in seven months he is angry, insisting he wouldn\u0027t have been shot if he had just stayed with Bill. He and Charley plan to go into hiding with a friend, refusing to join Bill in his plan to rob a bank in Texas. In response Bill recruits four cowboy friends of his: a mean character called George Bennett, brothers Asa and Jim Knight and a youth called Jim Wallace. Bill urges you to join him and his raw recruits in robbing the bank in Texas while Bitter Creek and Charley are equally insistent that you should join them in hiding.\n",
  "page 100": "You and your friends walk into the bank and draw your pistols.\n\n\"This is a robbery,\" you announce to the lone man behind the counter. \"Raise your hands.\"\n\nThe cashier promptly raises his hands, holding a pistol in one of them. Without hesitation he fires a shot, hitting Bitter Creek in the shoulder. Bitter Creek swears and you immediately fire, hitting the teller in the stomach, knocking him to the floor. \"Quickly,\" Bill yells, throwing his arm over the injured Bitter Creek and helping him outside.

  "page 104": "The death of Bill Dalton casts a shadow over the reunion of the Wild Bunch. Bill Doolin looks more haggard and older than you remember him, he, Bitter Creek and Dynamite Dick are all in pain from previous bullet wounds. Charley, always silent seems even more solemn than usual, Red Buck sits and scowls, Little Bill looks nervous, Little Dick is silent and even the usually cheerful Tulsa Jack seems quiet and withdrawn.\n\nThe death of your brother has led everyone to put their past differences behind them and this spring day Bill leads the gang to rob a train: boarding it at Dover Little Bill and Little Dick take the driver hostage and make him stop the train while you, Bill, Bitter Creek and Charley empty the express carriage. The robbery goes smoothly and mounting up you ride away to find you have escaped with just $1,000, making your share $100.\n\nYou ride all day until you reach a rocky valley where you decide to rest. Bill asks for someone to keep watch while the rest of the gang sleeps and Tulsa Jack volunteers to do it. You are not sure if one sentry is enough.\n",
  "page 107": "You walk into the bank with your friends and draw your pistols. The two tellers are quickly taken hostage and you and Bill leave your new recruits to guard them while you walk into the vault and quickly begin emptying it\u0027s contents into a sack.

A man behind a tree with a rifle, presumably the man who shot George, fires at you all missing.\n\n\"George went crazy and just opened fire on people!\" Jim shouts to you. Mounting up quickly the five of you spur your horses out of town, rifle shots zinging past you but fortunately not hitting you. A safe distance from the town you count the money in the sack and find you have escaped with $4,000, making your share $800.\n\n\"We need to split up,\" Bill announces. \"The Texas Rangers will be after us. I\u0027m going back to Indian Territory to hide out at a little cabin I have outside Elk.

  "page 55": "Abandoning your brothers you throw yourself onto your horse and spur it into a gallop. As you ride down the alley you glance back just in time to see Emmett shot down with a shotgun blast near a motionless Bob and Grat, all three of your brothers look dead. Swearing, with tears in your eyes, you spur your horse out of town and after Dick Broadwell. He is still riding his horse but gets slower and slower as you get closer. Just before you reach him he topples off his horse and lies motionless on the ground. Sure enough when you check him he is dead.\n\n\nThe Dalton Gang has been destroyed in Coffeyville and you are the only survivor.\n\n\nOver the next few weeks you go into hiding in the Indian Territory, trying to rejoin Bill Doolin, Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce.

You all reunite in the small town of Ingalls.\n",
  "page 109": "You and Bill travel back to the Indian Territory to a small one-roomed cabin Bill rents where you plan to lie low for a time. On your journey you read how Bill Doolin\u0027s half of the gang successfully robbed a bank in Missouri, like you escaping after a gun battle. In the cabin you both lie low for a few weeks until one fateful day you are both sitting inside one night when you hear a voice shout out \"We have the cabin surrounded! Come out with your hands up and no one will get hurt.\" \"It\u0027s the law!\" Bill hisses as you both jump to your feet.\n\nThere are only two ways out of the cabin: the front door and a small back window. Bill snatches up both of his pistols, cocks them and approaches the door. \"I\u0027m going to give them something to remember me by,\" he mutters to you.\n",

After a few more gunshots the town goes silent. You and your three brothers are all lying motionless in this alley of death.\n\n\nSomehow though you do not die. Though Emmett has suffered 23 separate injuries from the shotgun blast and you have even more wounds both of you somehow survive. Your brothers are not so lucky: both Bob and Grat die of their wounds moments after your injury, Bill Power and Dick Broadwell also do not survive the day. Four of the townsfolk lie dead. The sack of money lies between you and Emmett: it is picked up and carried back to the bank.\n\n\nAfter treatment for your injuries both you and Emmett receive life sentences in prison for your parts in the Raid. During your lengthy incarceration your other brother Bill teams up with Bill Doolin, Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce to continue robbing banks and trains. First Bill and then Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce are killed by lawmen... finally chance leads to you all being reunited.\n",
  "page 108": "You stay outside with the two cowboys while the others go into the bank. George seems ill at ease and strides up and down in front of the horses. His behaviour is so odd it draws the attention of some passing townsfolk who stop and stare. \"What are you looking at?\" George snaps at them. Without warning he raises his pistol and shoots one of the men in the arm.\n\nPanic ensues as people scream and run for cover while George begins laughing manically and firing pistol shots wildly at fleeing townsfolk, hitting two more. Jim swears and takes cover behind the horses while you draw your pistol and consider your position.\n",
  "page 57": "You and Bill grab handfuls of money off the counter and throw it into the back before following your companions out the front door. As you emerge from the bank several waiting townsfolk open fire on you. Bill is hit in the head and falls dead to the ground, a moment later you are shot through the heart and fall just in front of him. You and Bill are the first of eight men to die on this bloody day, moments later your brothers Bob and Grat are killed as well in this last battle of the Dalton Gang.\n",

Somehow you are unhit and the three of you make it to an alleyway where Grat sinks down behind an oil drum and starts firing his pistol down the street while Dick runs on towards the horses. Glancing back you can see Bill Power lying dead in the street, a bullet in his brain, while Emmett is running towards the alleyway from the right followed by Bob who is walking backwards, firing his pistol as he does. \"Go on Dan,\" Grat says hoarsely to you. \"I\u0027ll cover them.\"\n",

As he stoops and picks up the pistol you fire again, shooting him in the head. As you do a third man steps from cover and fires a rifle at you. The bullet hits you in the chest making you double up.

  "page 210": "The real-life Wild Bunch were not master outlaws or the great gunfighters of legend but a collection of extremely interesting characters destined for a tragic fate: apart from Emmett Dalton all five members of the Dalton Gang and all eleven main members of The Wild Bunch met violent ends, probably the highest number of fatalities suffered by any bank or train robbing gang.\n\nThe tragic thing is the Wild Bunch weren\u0027t even particularly good robbers: Jesse James made far more money in his career Jesse James\u0027s gang made five times more than the paltry $40,000 the various members of the Wild Bunch managed to steal in their sixteen robberies over seven years, Butch Cassidy\u0027s Hole in the Wall Gang made over ten times that amount. Their gunfights were frequent and many however and Coffeeville and Ingalls in particular stand out as iconic gunfights in Old Western History, the first being a great success for the side of the good and the latter for the side of the outlaws.\n\nBut the members of the Wild Bunch were an interesting bunch, with a few notable exceptions (Bob Dalton, George Bennett and Richard West spring to mind) they weren\u0027t cold-blooded killers but rather regular guys looking to have a good time, albeit by spending other\u0027s money. Their amateurism is reflected in their nicknames, having two guys in your gang called Dynamite Dick and Little Dick is usually not a sign of professional criminals looking to inspire terror in their victims!\n\nI\u0027ve taken a few liberties with history, the gunfights and robberies didn\u0027t usually happen in quite the way I\u0027ve described but writing this by stops and starts over the last six months has made me prefer creative licence to historical accuracy. Ultimately this is the story of interesting guys who did interesting things and whose activities were interesting enough for their names to become a part of the pantheon of outlaw history, that is itself part of the cultural heritage of America.\n\nHopefully their story made interesting reading :)\n",

  "page 68": "You join your brother Bill and fellow gang members Bill Doolin, Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce in heading down to Ingalls, a lawless community where you all feel safe and hidden. You spend the next six months hiding out and partying, an interlude only briefly ruined by the news that Ol Yantis was tracked down to his sister\u0027s home by two lawmen and shot dead while resisting arrest. By the summer of 1893 you are ready for action again and with a new gang.\n\n\nIn the last six months you and your fellow outlaws have recruited four new gang members, bringing your gang strength up to nine. There is Dynamite Dick, an explosives expert with an impressive nickname, Red Buck, a grim and dour man, Tulsa Jack, a good friend of Bill Doolin\u0027s and Arkansas Tom, a sharp-shooting well-dressed young man. Together the nine of you plan your first robbery in Kansas and in the summer of 1893 you strike.\n\n\nOne summer morning the nine of you board a train at Cimarron in Kansas and while the new recruits get the driver to stop the train and Bitter Creek and Charley Pierce guard the passengers you and the two Bill\u0027s make your way to the Express Carriage. You calmly empty the safe before you all dismount, run to your horses, mount up and ride away. On the ride you count the money you have stolen and find you have gotten away with $1,000, making your share $100.\n\n\nUnfortunately you do not get clean away, that afternoon as you are resting a posse of lawmen suddenly gallop over a nearby ridge. All of your mount up and firing pistols and rifles at each other you and your pursuers engage in a running battle for over a mile. There are no casualties on either side except Bill Doolin who is unlucky enough to be shot in the foot by a rifle shell, a painful but non-serious wound. Easily escaping the nine of you ride back to Ingalls unaware that an even deadlier enemy is in pursuit...\n",
  "page 67": "You decide to go with Ol to his sister\u0027s farm near the little community of Orlando in the Territory. You both spend nearly a month relaxing there until one afternoon you see two men approaching the small farm from the front. \"Ol! Dan Dalton!\" one of the men shouts. \"We know you\u0027re in there. We\u0027re lawmen, we\u0027ve got the building surrounded and if you come out with your arms raised no one will get hurt.\" You and Ol glance at each other nervously, the small farm only has one door facing the two lawmen with windows either side, though there are a few back windows.\n\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" you ask Ol who thinks for a moment. \"I\u0027m going to go out and tell them I\u0027m going to surrender and when they\u0027re not ready I\u0027m going to draw my pistol and let them have it. If you come with me I reckon there\u0027s a good chance we can get both of them.\" You consider his request: it\u0027s risky but it could work. An alternative option is to open a back window, climb out and take a chance escaping on foot.\n",
  "page 69": "You and Ol walk outside towards the two waiting lawmen who tense. \"What is this about?\" you ask. \"What is happening? Don\u0027t shoot we are surrendering.\" Suddenly Ol goes for his gun and you follow shoot. Ol gets off a shot before the lawmen realize what is happening and return fire: both of you are hit in the chest and after firing a shot harmlessly into the ground you fall face first to the ground, Ol toppling across your legs a moment later. You die within minutes while Ol expires of his wounds the next day, two more dead outlaws for dusty graves.\n",
  "page 60": "You follow Dick to the horses and both of you mount up, though your companion is bleeding heavily from his wounds. A glance back shows that Emmett has reached the alleyway and as you look Grat shoots down an approaching lawman of the town. As everything seems to be in order you spur your horse into life and gallop out of town with Dick. Unfortunately everything is not in order: Bob and Grat never make it out of the alleyway alive and Emmett is shot down too.\n\n\nYou cannot know this as you ride away as you are more concerned with Dick\u0027s condition: he reels alarmingly in the saddle and a short way from town he topples from his horse to the ground. Dismounting quickly you find he is dead of blood loss from his wounds. A quick glance up shows you that none of your brothers have made it out of town. Your heart sinking you mount up and ride on rapidly, the only one to escape this ill-fated raid.\n\n\nLater, over the coming weeks spent in hiding in the Indian Territory, you read how eight men died in the gunfight in Coffeyville including your brothers Bob and Grat.

  "page 61": "You run back and join Grat in firing from cover down the street As three men approach the alley down the street you fire your pistols at them, hitting and killing a lawman leading the trio. The other two men fire back, one bullet hitting Grat and the other hitting you. Both of you fall to the ground as Emmett runs by and Bob staggers up, bleeding from his own wound he topples to the ground near you. A moment later you hear a shotgun blast and then Emmett is down as well. You and your brothers Bob and Grat die of your wounds in that alleyway of death.\n",
  "page 64": "It\u0027s a somber group of six men that meet in the little town of Ingalls in the Indian Territory. You and your brother Bill are silent and serious when you meet Bill Doolin, bearded now, and his companions: the veteran outlaw Bitter Creek, his mute friend Charley Pierce and a new recruit called Ol Yantis. Despite the news from Coffeyville all of you are resolved to continue your outlaw careers with your brother Bill now declaring he wants to be an even more infamous outlaw than your late brother Bob.\n\n\n\"The newspapers say the Dalton Gang is destroyed and called us \u0027a wild bunch of fugitives,\" Bill Doolin says grimly. \"I suggest we show them what The Wild Bunch is capable of.\" A plan is quickly hatched to rob a bank in Kansas to show that despite Coffeyville robbing banks in the state still does not intimidate you. One winter\u0027s day your newly formed Wild Bunch ride into Kansas to show America the spirit of the Dalton Gang is still alive and well.\n\n\nRiding into the little town of Spearville you all dismount outside the bank and you, Bill and Bill walk inside while the others guard your horse. Taking the teller hostage you rapidly empty the vault of it\u0027s money, lock the teller inside, walk out of the bank, mount up and ride away. Making it back across the border into the Indian Territory you are delighted by the ease of the robbery which has netted you all $1500, making your share $200.\n\n\nThe papers are soon full of news of what they call \"The Doolin-Dalton Gang\" and the two Bill\u0027s are pleased. Ol is less so, he has been identified as an outlaw and wants to visit his sister\u0027s farm to say goodbye to his family while the rest of the Gang is planning on hiding out in Ingalls. You need to choose who to go with.\n",
