Years pass and your surroundings will most likely change. You may very well live a life time in the story.\nAs with any of my writings, the story comes before the game. However while there isn\u0027t a complex inventory and all of that, you can technically \"win\" by getting one of the epilogues.\nThere are 13 epilogues total.\nThere are also several points in the story where there are links that lead to more background information on various people, places, things and events. While not completely necessary to understanding the story, they do give you more insight into it."]
