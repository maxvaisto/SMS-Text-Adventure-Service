["18","Hunting the Ripper","Will11","6","6","7.03","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/Hunting_the_Ripper.aspx","\"Jack the Ripper is dead / Jack the Ripper is dead / He\u0027s lying on his bed / Bleeding through his head / Jack the Ripper is dead\" - A Victorian Children\u0027s Skipping Rope Song.\nDeath stalks the fog-shrouded streets of London as prostitutes are killed and mutilated in the darkness of the night... As a Private Detective working alongside Scotland Yard you will be faced with the most challenging adversary of your career, a man who\u0027s very name has become a byword for terror: Jack the Ripper. Are you smart enough to catch him?\nBEWARE: This game is 200+ pages long and will take about 30-60 minutes to read through. Do not read if operating heavy machinery, juggling chainsaws or entertaining small children.\nAuthor\u0027s Note: This story will require some thinking and the reader might want to make notes, though with a bit of cleverness and logic readers should be able to correctly identify the real Ripper. About 95% of the information in this story is historically accurate.  Finally as you\u0027d probably guess a story about hunting someone who killed and mutilated prostitutes is not a feel-good family comedy, if you are under 13 I don\u0027t recommend that you read this. Certainly do not google \"Jack the Ripper victims\" if you suffer from nightmares :D"]
