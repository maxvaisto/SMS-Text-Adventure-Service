You ask them if they heard any sounds of a struggle or of voices last night and they both shake their heads.\n\n\n“I didn’t hear anything all night,” Mr Hewitt tells you firmly.\n\n\n“It seems a bit strange that a woman was stabbed forty times outside your bedroom door and neither you or your wife heard anything,\" Reid says skeptically.\n\n\n“At one point last night I heard someone cry out \u0027Murder\u0027 in a loud voice but it seemed to me that the sound came from outside the building,” Mrs Hewitt says suddenly.\n\n\n “This is a rather rough neighborhood and cries, screams for help and loud drunks can be heard round here most nights,” Mr Hewitt puts in. “We don\u0027 think much of them. Personally I think this poor creature crept up the staircase accompanied by a man for... immoral purposes, that a quarrel took place for some reason or another and that he stabbed her.”\n\n\n\n\nYou and Reid exchange glances and thank the pair. As you turn to go Mr Hewitt holds up a hand.\n\n\n“You might want to talk to Alfred Crow in Room 35 or Elizabeth Mahoney at number 47.

I would describe him as a Private wearing the uniform of the Grenadier Guards, aged between 22 and 26, approximately five feet and nine inches tall with a fair complexion, dark hair, a small brown mustache and a good conduct badge but no medals. I asked him what he was doing and he told me he was “waiting for a chum who had gone off with a girl.\u0027”\n\nYou and Reid exchange glances, your excitement mounting.\n\n\n“Approximately three hours later this man John Reeves ran up to tell me he had found a dead woman lying inside the George Yard Building. We went there and saw a plump woman lying on her back on the landing in a great pool of blood. Her hands were tightly clenched at her side, her legs were spread open and her clothes were pulled up leaving her lower half exposed. She was approximately thirty five years old, five feet three inches with a dark complexion, dark hair and wore a green skirt, brown petticoat, black jacket, spring-sided boots and a black bonnet. Her clothes were all old and stained. I sent Reeves to fetch Dr Killeen who arrived, pronounced the unfortunate lady dead and I helped remove her body to Montague Street before coming here to make my report.”\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a model of good police work Barrett,\" Reid says happily.

I send you half the kidney I took from one woman and preserved it for you, the other piece I fried and ate. It was very nice. I may send you the bloody knife that took it out if you only wait a while longer.

Since escaping detectives in Liverpool he vanished are unknown though rumors put his current whereabouts in anywhere from London to France.\n\n\nThen there is Joseph Barnett, Mary Kelly\u0027s boyfriend. Abberline has actually put together a rather strong case on him: generally his apearrence tallies with various descriptions of the killer. Mary Kelly\u0027s room was locked from the inside, either the killer reached through the broken window next to the door to lock the door from the inside and took the key with him (a perfectly possible scenario) or Barnett used his own key to lock the door. Finally there were ginger beer bottles in Mary Kelly\u0027s room, in letters most likely to have been written by the Ripper he mentions keeping blood in ginger beer bottles.\n\n\nGeorge Hutchinson, one of the witnesses who saw a suspicious man with Mary Kelly came to Abberline\u0027s attention as his description of the man with her seemed a little too detailed and it seems strange that he followed the pair of them around for some time. Abberline suspects if Hutchinson was the real killer then this was a ruse to throw you off the scent.\n\n\nAlois Szemeredy is an interesting man you learn about in police records. Twelve years ago in Buenos Aires, Argentina a prostitute called Carolina Metz had her throat cut by an unknown man. Szemeredy, a notorious thief and certified lunatic, was arrested on suspicion of murder but eventually acquitted after a long and closely-fought trial. Afterwards he fled back to his native Hungary where he vanished again three years ago, Abberline has heard rumors that he may be in London now.\n\n\nFinally there is Dr Francis Tumblety. Tumblety is currently wanted by the London Police for \"committing indecent acts with other men\" (as Abberline diplomatically puts it). Tumblety has skipped bail and fled to France where he has booked passage on a ship back to his native America. Because Tumblety is an out-spoken woman-hater he is being tracked by Abberline\u0027s officers who want to question him in connection with the Ripper murders.\n\n\nYou will have to move fast as all of these suspects are constantly on the move and in the cases of Kelly and Szemeredy you are not even sure of their current locations.
