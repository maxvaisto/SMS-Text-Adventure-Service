  "page 123": "“No.” you say.\n“Suzy? What?” Julie says.\n“No, I’m not leaving. She’s been a bully to me all my life. It ends today.” You say.\n“Wow! I can hardly believe you’re the same Suzy that spent hiding from the rest of the world. Guess you’ve finally learned to stand up and be a woman.” Kelly says with a smirk.\n\n“But so what? You think because you’ve survived some of the horrors out there, you think standing up to me is going to suddenly change the situation? Got news for ya, it ain’t. I can blow your fucking head off with one twitch of my finger. Last chance to get the fuck out of my house!” Kelly adds.\n“Fuck you Kelly. I know you. You already made up your mind to kill me as soon as I woke up. I turn my back and you’ll probably shoot me for the hell of it as I walk out the door.”\n\nKelly starts laughing.\n\n“Well like I said, you always were a smart one. Too bad you did something incredibly stupid by walking in here in the first place.”\n“Kelly, please! Just let us go! We won’t come back! We’ll just…” Julie starts to plead\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU DUMB BITCH OR YOU’LL BE FIRST!” Kelly shouts before turning her attention back to you.\n\nJulie at this point starts sobbing uncontrollably. You continue to stare down the barrel of the shotgun like you’re fearless, but that isn’t true at all and Kelly knows it.\n\n“You can give me the hard looks all you want, but deep down I know you’re ready to shit your panties. Which I imagine you’ll do after you’re dead anyway. You ready to die little sister?”\n“Sure, just a little surprised you’d choose this method. Guess you’re more intimidated by me than I thought.”\n“What?” Kelly snorts.\n“You’re intimidated by me. You always have been. I really should’ve seen it before.”\n“You’re fucking crazy. I’ve never been intimidated by you.”\n“Sure you have, that’s why you’ve bullied me all these years. You’ve said yourself on many occasions on how pretty I am so I know you’re jealous of my looks. You’ve just admitted that I’m smart. The only thing that I always lacked in was self-confidence and now that I have that, well I’m pretty much better than you…”\n“Fuck you Suzy!” Kelly says.\n“No, I get it, you want to play it safe and shoot me, because hey if I gained self-confidence, who knows I might just be able to kick your ass in a fair fight.”\n“Hah, not fuckin’ likely…”\n“Well I guess we’ll never know, because you’ll shoot me and Julie and then go down and hide in the fucking basement…well what do you know…we’re more alike than you thought. Imagine that.”\n\nAnd with that taunt it’s the last straw. Kelly flies into a rage. It’s the kind of rage she flies into when she’s participating in her underground fight club. She abandons all rational thought, drops the shotgun to the side and lunges at you with both of her hands going straight for your neck.\n\nJulie is knocked to one side and you fall backward on the couch. You attempt to roll and scramble to escape, but Kelly grabs you by the hair.\n\n“You’re right, beating your scrawny ass to death WILL be more enjoyable.” Kelly exclaims.\n“Julie, grab the shotgun!” you manage to shout before Kelly throws you face first into the bookcase. Kelly then stops Julie from scrambling on the floor for the shotgun by kicking her in the side and then stomping on her back.\n\nStill struggling to recover you grab some of the heavier books that have fallen near you and start throwing them at Kelly. A couple hit her in the head and she ceases abusing Julie and returns to attack you.\n\nYou manage to throw one more book at her face, but it doesn’t even slow her down. She punches you in the stomach causing you to collapse as you feel the air leave all your body and feel like you can’t breathe. As you wheeze, Kelly leans down and grabs the back of your neck with one of her hands. It feels like a fucking vice.\n\n“A hit to the gut, fucks you all up doesn’t it? Feels like you’re suffocating, can’t breathe, can’t do much of anything really. It’s how Houdini died you know. I’m gonna hurt you so badly Suzy, you don’t even know…but you soon will.”\n\nKelly with her other hand smashes a fist into the side of your face. You feel your eye almost close immediately as the rest of you hits the floor. If you could catch your breath, you probably would’ve cried out from the pain though you’re a little dizzy more than anything right now.\n\n“Thought you could kick my ass. Bitch please, what the fuck were you thinking? This isn’t a goddamn comic book or movie…shit!”\n\nKelly’s body lands on top of yours with crushing weight. You then hear a shotgun blast and some debris of the bookcase consisting of paper and cheap wood fall on you and Kelly.\n\n“LEAVE HER ALONE YOU FUCKING CUNT!” you hear Julie scream.\n\nYou still aren’t in any condition to do anything, but Kelly certainly is. She scrambles for the pistol still in the front of her pants and gets up while yanking you up with one hand to use you as a human shield.\n\nJulie takes cover around a corner when Kelly starts shooting. Four shots are fired before clicking follows.\n\n“Fuck!” Kelly exclaims and drops the pistol.\n\nYou’re practically deaf from the proximity of a pistol going off near your head along with being disorientated. Kelly positions herself behind the couch to give herself some extra cover. She also tightens her grip around your neck with her forearm and puts her other hand on your head ready to break your neck in a second if need be.\n\nJulie comes back out from around the corner weeping, but unsteadily pointing the shotgun at Kelly.\n\n“No…Suzy…(Sob) Let her go!”\n\n“Julie, you’re not in any position to give orders. Now granted with a shotgun and you don’t need perfect aim at this range, but your precious girlfriend here is BOUND to get hit in the process. Never mind the fact I could break her neck before you get the courage to pull the trigger anyway.”\n“LET HER GO!” Julie screams again.\n“Not gonna happen whore. You got two choices. You try to do the impossible by trying to hit me or you walk out the door and go on with your life. Either way one thing is certain, Suzy here isn’t going anywhere. Her fate is sealed and there isn’t anything you can do about it. Think about it Julie. Do you really want to be the one that kills her? Just walk away now taking solace in the fact that you never had a choice.” Kelly says.\n\nEven with one blurring eye open right now, you can see Julie just standing there sobbing and looking so helpless, despite wielding a shotgun.\n\n“Suzy…I don’t know what to do… (sob)” Julie cries.\n\nYou feel like you’re going to pass out with Kelly’s big meaty arm wrapped around your neck right now.\n",
  "page 244": "You might not be in the best condition right now, but you’re not going off with some stranger. You don’t know who this woman is and with your luck she could be some psycho.\n\n“No, I’m okay. I’ll make it on my own.” You say.\n“Are you sure? You really don’t look well.” The woman says.\n“I said I’m fine.” You say starting to get agitated.\n“Alright, alright, just trying to help. I’ll go.” The woman says and steps away.\n\nAs the woman goes back to her large black truck, you survey the immediate area and see that your accident isn’t being paid much attention to. Other vehicles are merely driving by and nearby onlookers lose interest. You look over at the other vehicle on the far end of the street that slammed into you. The front end of that one is trashed and the driver has gone half way through the windshield. He’s a bloody mess and isn’t moving.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is get your bearings, because you don’t even know where the hell you’re at right now.\n\nYou walk away from your vehicle, nearly falling a couple times until you lean up against the side of a building. You really feel woozy. You’re starting to wonder if you shouldn’t have taken the woman up on her offer.\n\nYou try to ask a few people that are nearby where you are and they just brush you off. None of them offer to help you and one of them actually snarls like some sort of animal. The people in this town really have lost their damn minds.\n\nSince you don’t know where you’re at and you’re not exactly thinking clearly, you employ a simple plan of just going in a straight direction until you start to recognize something. It’s about all you can do at this point.\n\nAlong the way, you get to see up close just how bad the town is getting. And it’s even scarier now that you’re not even within the safety of a vehicle. You attempt to maintain a low profile and hasten your pace, but it’s a little difficult to do since you’re limping along.\n\nEventually you see a park a block ahead of you and instantly recognize it. It’s actually the same place you met Bobby once upon a time. You sort of wish he was here right now.\n\n\nYou think you can make it to Julie’s from the park, that would probably be your best bet since you were told the hospital was sort of screwed and going home is probably a longer walk. She’s probably got more than enough painkillers there anyway.\n\nWith this new goal in mind, you press onwards toward the park thinking you just might make this after all.\n\nThen several gunshots ring out. You don’t even know from what direction, you just duck behind a nearby-parked car.\n\nYou hear shouting and shooting. You peek your head up just enough to see three armed men in animal masks running towards your direction, but shooting in the other.\n\nYou duck your head back down when you see one catch a bullet to the head. From your cover, you hear another one cry out and the falling of a body.\n\nThe third one however jumps over the hood of the car you’re hiding behind…\n\nYou freeze as the bunny masked man stares directly at you.\n\n“You’ll do.” He says and grabs you. You try to resist, but after a couple pistol-whips to your face, you become more limp and he picks you up.\n\n“Alright! You pigs better not fuckin’ shoot or I’ll blow this yellow haired bitch’s brains out.” He shouts holding you up in front of him and pointing his pistol at your head.\n\nIn your blurry vision you can see several police officers in front of you with their weapons drawn.\n\nYou’ve got the masked man shouting near your ear, the cops are shouting back and you just wish you weren’t here anymore. The past few days have been just plain shitty and they’re obviously not going to get any better. With your luck, you’ll get shot and not even die right away because that’s certainly how this week has been going.\n\nWell not if you can help it. You’ve still got some control over your destiny.\n\n“Just shoot the motherfucker.” You utter and start squirming causing the criminal to start grabbing you tighter.\n“Shut the fuck up bitch!” he shouts.\n“Just shoot you fucking pigs! Look at this shithole town, do you think anyone’s really going to question you if a civilian gets caught in the crossfire anymore? Just fucking shoot!”\n\nThe cops at this point briefly look at each other and nod, they aren’t even telling you to calm down. Maybe they already planned to just shoot anyway. Good.\n\n“Fuck this!” the masked man shouts and starts firing on the cops, who return fire immediately.\n\nYou’re hit several times during their shoot out with the masked man and finally something goes your way, you die instantly.\n",
  "page 243": "Considering how fucked things are in town and your woozy condition, you probably wouldn’t be safe walking the streets right now. This woman also seems okay; she’s actually being more helpful than most would. Most would’ve just drove off, let alone offer to give you medical attention.\n\n“Alright, let’s go.” You say and the woman nods and helps you head towards her black truck. You around and see your accident isn’t even being paid much attention to. Other vehicles are merely driving by and nearby onlookers lose interest. You look over at the other vehicle on the far end of the street that slammed into you. The front end of that one is trashed and the driver has gone half way through the windshield. He’s a bloody mess and isn’t moving.\n\n“You think that other driver is dead?” you ask.\n“Dunno, I didn’t check on him. I just checked you first since you were closer to my vehicle. Just going by his appearance and the fact he hasn’t moved I’d say it isn’t good. Can’t save everyone though. Come on, let’s just get off the street and out of this town.” She says.\n\nThe woman helps you into her truck and then gets into the driver side, before you know it; she’s started it up and driving off.\n\nThe interior of the truck is pretty nice. Comfy seats and everything. The dashboard looks like something out of a science fiction movie. Must be a really new model.\n\n“You doing okay over there? You don’t feel like you’re going to pass out do you?” the woman asks.\n“No, not really. Still just sore mainly.” You respond.\n“That’s good. Maybe you’re okay for the most part, but it doesn’t hurt for you to get checked out. My name’s Lilith by the way.”\n“My name’s Suzy.” You say.\n“Didn’t think your name was actually mud like you said back there. Still, sort of a strange reaction you had laughing about your car crash.” Lilith says.\n“Yeah, well I’ve just been having a really bad day and that accident just sort of topped it, so I guess I just laughed instead of crying like I have been doing for the past couple days.”\n“Hmm, you been having a lot mood swings lately?” Lilith asks.\n“I don’t usually have mood swings at all, but like I said, there have been some major events going down in what was my previously calm life that have really fucked with my stability. I’m getting thrown out of my house, my boyfriend broke up with me, I can’t get a job, I just trashed my brother’s car and I have no idea what my future prospects are going to be. Things can’t get much worse.”\n“Oh they can always get worse, but yeah if all that shit has happened to you, then I guess your laughing at the car crash situation is a little understandable. Self defense mechanism and all.”\n\nLilith’s inquisitive nature causes you to be a little inquisitive too.\n\n“You a psychiatrist or something like that?” you ask.\n“Eh, something like that. I observe a lot of human behavior for the company I work for. Usually other employees, but lately it’s mostly been non-employees in relation to the company.” Lilith says.\n“You wouldn’t have any job opening at this company for unskilled labor would you? A cleaning woman perhaps?” you ask.\n“Heh, well I’m not exactly involved in the hiring process, but Ground Zero is a big company and we pretty much have a lot of openings for all kinds of positions. I’m sure I could find something for you.” Lilith says.\n\nThere’s a pause as you aren’t sure what you just heard.\n\n“Wait a minute. Did you just say you work for Ground Zero? That company that’s been putting out all those annoying ads non-stop for the past few weeks?” you ask.\n“Guilty as charged. Trust me, I know how annoying those ads are all over the place, but I’m not involved that department either.” Lilith remarks.\n“I didn’t even know you guys even had a headquarters here in a small town like this one.”\n“It’s more of a small branch office really and it’s so non-descript most don’t even know it’s there anyway. We do have a bigger place in Security City. Sometimes I go all the way out there to do my job too, but since I live just south of town it’s a pretty long drive as you might expect. In those cases I usually just sleep at a hotel room paid for by the company until my work there is done.”\n“I thought you said your brother lived south of town.”\n“He does. We live together. It’s a large house that’s been in the family awhile and we did grow up there so we never wanted to get rid of it and we just decided to keep living there. Might sound a bit child like, but why move when you don’t really need too?”\n“Hey you don’t need to tell me. I wish I didn’t have to move from my home. So does your brother work for Ground Zero too?” you ask.\n“No. I wish he did since his talents would really be useful to us, but Leslie’s really not a fan of the corporate lifestyle despite the fact that I keep telling him he wouldn’t even be working in a position that requires dress codes and such. Leslie’s also always been a bit of an independent thinker too. He could’ve easily been a doctor working at a hospital pulling down lots of money, but he prefers his humble private practice. Who am I to tell him to do something that doesn’t make him happy?”\n“Well you certainly sound like a more understanding sister than my own who is kicking me out of the house.” You respond.\n“See, that’s not right. Family should stick together. Well at least that’s what I was always taught. Even when you don’t agree with them, you should at least help them out, not leave them twisting. I’m really sorry to hear that your sister is doing that to you.” Lilith says.\n“Thanks for your sympathy, but she’s always hated me and I imagine my brother will too now that I’ve wrecked his car, though to be honest he didn’t really care that much about me either. I’m sort of a black sheep.” You say.\n“Mm. Interesting. My brother and I are sort of black sheep as well, since we’re not religious like the rest of the family, but like I said, it hasn’t completely ruined our generally good relationship with most of them. To be honest though my brother’s personality is more likely to do that than our lack of religious beliefs.” Lilith laughs.\n\nYou aren’t quite sure what to think right now driving with an employee of Ground Zero. Certainly was a pretty unexpected twist of events. It’s even more surprising that she’s seemingly pretty nice since you’ve always had the idea that someone working for GZ would be on the cold and uncaring side. You’re just hoping that after her brother checks you out, she’ll help you out on the job front somehow. Whatever you’d be doing, it probably would pay more than a cashier at a comic shop.\n\nYou and Lilith are silent for a bit while she tries to concentrate on getting out of town. Eventually after several near misses the pair of you are finally out of there.\n\n“Shit, I thought we were going into another accident a couple times.” You remark.\n“Yeah, it’s been pretty crazy in town lately. Should be relatively smooth sailing from here though.” Lilith says.\n“How far do you live?”\n“Oh, not that far. We’ll be coming up to it soon enough.” Lilith says.\n“Your brother must really be a good doctor to have patients coming all the way out here to see him. Is it mostly a steady supply of the richer folks making the journey?”\n“Not as many as you might think. Honestly, Leslie gets more people that don’t have health insurance or are otherwise on the poorer side really. People who don’t have anyone to help them. As to how folks get to the place, well my brother’s got a couple assistants who drive people to him and they more or less provide this service for cheap. Occasionally my brother will drive people back to his clinic himself. Like I said, he could’ve been pulling down a lot of money, but he prefers the more personal touch of private practice.”\n“Well, he certainly sounds like a humanitarian.” You say.\n“Oh he is. He is. More than you know.”\n\nAbout a half hour passes and you see one of those old colonial houses in the distance. It’s very isolated as there isn’t another house in sight and you haven’t seen another one since you left town.\n\n“Is that your home?” you ask.\n“Yep, that’s it.” Lilith responds.\n“Pretty big. Looks very old.”\n“Oh it is on both accounts. I mean of course inside has all the modern luxuries, but I wanted the outside to still have that old charm.”\n“Pretty isolated out here.”\n“Yeah. It has its advantages though.\n\nLilith soon turns and pulls into the house’s extended driveway and stops the vehicle.\n\n“Well we’re here, you okay to get out of the car by yourself?” Lilith asks.\n“Yeah. I actually don’t even ache as much now and I’m not dizzy at all. I’m wondering if I’ve just wasted your time.” You say.\n“Nonsense, this hasn’t been a waste of time at all. I actually enjoyed our conversation on the way here. I don’t really talk to many people outside of work and my brother.”\n\nYou get out of the truck and take a look at the house. It’s even more impressive now that you’re in front of it. A lot of care has obviously gone into its upkeep. You notice another car in the driveway that looks a lot less fancy than Lilith’s truck. Must be her brother’s vehicle.\n\nLilith is still in the truck fumbling around with something in her purse as you continue to take in the sights. Eventually she gets out though.\n\n“Okay, sorry about that. I got so much shit in this bag I sometimes have to recheck to make sure I got everything.” Lilith says clutching some keys and her large bag.\n“Sure, no problem.”\n“Let’s go around the back. It’s quicker to get to Leslie’s office that way. Just follow that path.”\n\nYou walk on the stone path that leads around the back of the house and Leslie follows closely behind. Along the way see a few rows of well-tended blue and purple flowers on both sides of the pathway.\n\n“Aren’t they lovely?” Lilith remarks.\n“They certainly are colorful. I’m not too familiar with flowers though.” You say.\n“They’re called Morning Glorys. My brother though keeps calling them Morningstars. I think he only does that because that’s our last name and he can’t be bothered to remember a new name with morning in it.” Lilith chuckles.\n\nYou stop walking.\n\n“Did you just say your last name was Morningstar?” you ask.\n“Yes, why?” Lilith says.\n“My boyfriend’s last name was Morningstar.” You say.\n“Is that right? Wow, what are the odds?”\n\nYou suddenly feel very uneasy.\n\nYou slowly start to turn around and before you can react, Lilith grabs your arm and stabs it with a needle. She injects you with something before you can even pull away.\n\nWhatever it was is taking effect almost immediately and you’re already beginning to lose your balance.\n\n“Careful, careful. Don’t fall on the flowers now.” Lilith says.\n\nYou can’t even speak; you just look at Lilith in shock as you fall on the pavement struggling to remain conscious.\n\nLilith crouches down and stares at you, as your eyes start to close.\n\n“…now I know who you are. Bobby mentioned you to me a couple times recently when he was trying to convince us to go live in his compound. Never figured you’d be the same Suzy. (Sigh) Too bad you told me you two broke up though…guess that explains why you’re not at the compound with him.”\n\nYou grab at Lilith, but she easily pulls away from your weak grasp. She just continues to look on at you as a scientist might look at a test subject.\n\n“…still…I suppose this might make things a little more complicated. Oh well, I guess this will just make things a little more interesting too. Get some rest Suzy, we’re going to have a big day tomorrow.”\n\nWith those last words, you completely pass out.\n",
  "page 246": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\nYou wake up and remembering everything that happened just before you passed out, you attempt to sit up immediately, unfortunately you can’t due to being restrained. Your legs, your arms and even your body are all strapped down on a gurney.\n\nYou can’t cry out either as you have a ball gag on your mouth. You can make loud “Mmhghm!” sounds but that’s about it.\n\nYour clothing has also changed. While you’re not naked, you’re in one of those hospital gowns. You don’t feel sore or anything, so you can only hope you weren’t raped during the time someone was changing your clothes.\n\nThe fear of what’s going to happen to you is overwhelming.\n\nA quick glance around from you position shows that you’re in a plain white room with no windows. There is a light above and a chair and door to your right, but to your left gives you cause for more terror as you see a table full of surgical instruments. A lot of them don’t even look like proper surgical instruments so much as they look like torture devices.\n\nThere isn’t much you can do except wait and attempt to stop crying though you fail in that endeavor. You just lie there thinking about how you said yesterday that things couldn’t get any worse…and then they did.\n\nYou think about what you could’ve done differently to have made your life better and most importantly avoid the situation you’re in now. You then think about how at some point, either Lilith, her brother or both are going to come in and start cutting you up and torturing you to death.\n\nYou’re completely helpless and you wish that someone would just come in and save you from all this. The door suddenly opens and you turn your head hoping that somehow your magical thinking worked, but you only see Lilith walking in with a notebook in hand.\n\n“Figured you should be up by now. Sorry to keep you knocked out for so long, but I’m sure you can see it was completely necessary. Couldn’t have you running away or anything.”\n\nYou turn away from Lilith who then gets closer and stares at your face a moment.\n\n“Hmm, you’ve been crying. Natural response I suppose given your situation. Good. (Sigh) I told my brother not to put those in here.” Lilith says taking notice of the surgical instruments and shaking her head.\n\n“He probably thought it would be funny to have you even more terrified out of your mind than you already would be. I love Leslie with all my heart, but he really can be an inconsiderate asshole sometimes. Well most of the time really, anyway the main thing is don’t pay any attention to those tools over there. That’s not what I brought you in for.”\n\nLilith puts her notebook on the table with the tools and addresses you again.\n\n“Now. I’m going to release your ball gag since I’m sure it’s uncomfortable. However when I do, I must ask you NOT to scream or anything like that. First of all it won’t do any good. Second, it’s terribly annoying. If we’re going to have a positive relationship Suzy, it’s absolutely necessary that you comply with my instructions. Do you understand?”\n\nYou don’t really have much in the way of choices and resisting her with no way of actually doing anything would probably just result in something bad. You nod your head compliantly and Lilith takes off your ball gag.\n\n“Are you going to kill me?” you ask.\n“Ah the predictable question first. Well, we’re going to get to that and several other questions you might have, but we’re going to be doing this my way. So while I know you’re very nervous and scared, you’re going to just have to wait a while before they get answered. Do you understand?”\n\nOnce again you nod silently.\n\n“Good. Very compliant. We’re getting off on the right foot Suzy. Now then let’s get to some of the more minor concerns you might have had running through your mind while you were laying here.”\n\nLilith pulls the chair over to the table and after moving some of the tools out of the way she sits down, opens up her notebook and begins writing something in it while addressing you.\n\n“I want to first alleviate any concerns you might have had about being sexually molested while you were unconscious. I assure you I undressed and dressed you myself. And since I’m not a lesbian you were completely unharmed as far as that goes. I can see one of the obvious reasons that would cause Bobby to be enamored with you though. You’re a very pretty girl with a nice body and it’s obvious just by speaking with him he still loves you despite your break up.”\n“…you…you spoke with Bobby?” you ask.\n“Oh yes. Called him up as soon as I got you in the house. Took awhile to reach him, but eventually I did and I proceeded to have a very long conversation with him. I wanted to know more about you and only Bobby could provide those answers what with you being unconscious and all. He told me about how you met, your general personality, what you liked to do, and all of that stuff. When I asked what exactly caused the break up, he seemed to stumble over his words a bit. He claimed that he realized he couldn’t abandon the silly family traditions, but it seemed like there was more to it than that because he kept insisting it was his fault and not yours. As if that was going to change what is going to be going on over here. You want to shed a little light on it Suzy? Please be honest.”\n“I…I (sniffle) didn’t want to get married to him. I didn’t want to live under the same roof as Diana since she was his ex and she hates me. I suppose…I also wasn’t fond of the idea of having a bunch of babies like he wanted either. Our argument sort of spiraled from there.” You answer.\n“Hm, interesting. So you wouldn’t consider yourself a domestic woman then. I suppose I can understand that. I certainly wouldn’t want to spend most of my time barefoot and pregnant and my whole life revolving around my man’s needs. I don’t think my brother would like that either. He gets so wrapped up in his experiments that I don’t even see him for days sometimes and he’d probably be homeless and living under a bridge if I wasn’t working.” Lilith chuckles and continues writing.\n\nYou remain extremely anxious about what’s going to happen to you.\n\n“I also can understand not wanting to live with my bitchy niece either. I know my nephew probably didn’t think anything of it, but I also wouldn’t have put it past him to hope for some sort of three way between you all. Good for you, putting your foot down like that.”\n\nAll you can think is you’d willingly have a three-way with Bobby and Diana if it got you out of this situation.\n\n“Anyway when my nephew found out you were over here he practically pleaded for me and his uncle not to kill or harm you in any way. He even said he’d be over to pick you up, but I told him that was completely out of the question since plans were already in motion. Still, I love my nephew and didn’t wish to cause him any suffering so I agreed that you would not come to any harm as long as you followed the rules. So there’s the obvious question answered.”\n\nYou close your eyes silently thanking Bobby that he spoke up for you. Of course this doesn’t make your fear disappear completely. Far from it, but at least you might have a glimmer of hope now.\n\n“With that out of the way, your other questions are probably what is going to be done to you. Well, before I called Bobby, my initial intention was to do some tests and study you since I wanted another subject to observe and I saw an opportunity to grab you when you nearly crashed into me. However, some things have obviously changed, but there is still is opportunity here so I’m going to take advantage of it.”\n“…what do you mean?” you ask thinking Lilith has decided to completely twist her word to Bobby somehow.\n\n“I’m getting to that. As you might’ve noticed most of the folks in town have gone completely nuts. Well there’s a reason for that and you’re going to be one of the few people outside of the higher-ranking Ground Zero personnel to learn about it.”\n\nLilith stops writing to give you her complete attention.\n\n“We put an experimental drug in the water supply and that’s what’s causing most people to act the way they’re doing in town. In fact we’ve done this to a lot of places. As bad as what’s going on in town, I imagine it’s even worse in a bigger populated area like Security City.” Lilith says.\n\nWhile you’re still worried about yourself, this bit of information is a little frightening for other reasons.\n\n“Wait. What? Why?” you ask.\n“Well there are very good reasons I assure you, but most of them probably wouldn’t matter to most with any sort of so called ethical concerns on human testing. Indeed I don’t even know all of the answers myself, I’m just a small cog in a big relentless machine. All I can do is tell you this, the world IS going to change very severely and very soon and it’s Ground Zero’s goal to try to save the human race at any cost. Our shelters aren’t the only way we’re doing that.” Lilith says.\n“But how is putting crazy juice in the water supply doing that?” you ask.\n“Well, I’m not completely familiar with all the science involved, but it basically makes people more resilient to things like diseases, radiation, and even chemical gases. You know, anything that’s likely to wipe out humanity on a wide scale when our glorious world leaders start pressing buttons. It seems like it increases strength and speed as well. Unfortunately it would seem it has a very negative effect on the mind, but that of course was an unintended side effect. However, if animal testing is anything to go by, those effects should only be temporary.”\n“But how long do they last?”\n“With animals? A few weeks, but we never really got to test on humans at least not on a wide scale. There were some individual tests I believe, but those were the earlier stages of the drug and the results of those weren’t very positive. Ground Zero wanted to pick a populated area to do testing on years ago to hammer out all the problems quicker, but we had an agreement with government, which kept dragging its damn feet as usual on things. It didn’t help that GZ was also temporarily burdened with some incompetent leadership for a while so we didn’t get to do any of this until the last minute and now this is the result. Don’t get me started on the faulty elevator problems in most of the shelters…”\n\nLilith at this point shakes her head and runs her fingers through her hair as if dismayed with how things have turned out. As she’s doing this, a horrible conclusion comes to you.\n\n“Wait…am I going to go crazy too? I drank mostly bottled water!” you say.\n“Yes, a lot of people do these days, but most people still bathe regularly, brush their teeth and such and all that is still enough even if you’re not drinking straight from the tap. As for if you’re going to go crazy, well that’s a matter of perspective. Given what I know about you, I have to say from a professional perspective you’re not exactly a beacon of sanity Suzy, but then who of us really is right? If you were worried that you’re going to start going into a violent fit of rage, I’d have to say I don’t think you are since you haven’t already. The drug doesn’t seem to be affecting everyone in town the same way for some reason. Not sure why, but again that’s why I’m keeping you around for observation. You’re going to be my control subject as it were.”\n“What does that mean?” you ask.\n“What it essentially means is as long as you cooperate and don’t try to escape, you’ll be well taken care of. I’ll ask you questions, maybe do a few non-invasive tests and that’s about it. If it seems you’re completely fine, I guess we’ll move on from there. For now though I think you should have better accommodations don’t you? This room is rather spartan, I’m going to take you to a new one. Now, I could call my brother in here or just wheel you to it still strapped to the gurney, but I’d rather NOT do that Suzy. I want our relationship to be a trusting one. So, I’m going to release you from your straps, you’ll follow me and you WILL NOT try to escape or anything like that. Do you understand?”\n\nOf course you’re going to say yes to Lilith, no matter what, but your intentions are another matter.\n\nWhile Lilith seems like a reasonable lady, she’s still a Morningstar and all that entails from what you know of that fucked up family. She might not be one of the chaos goddess worshipping brainwashed cultist ones, but she’s obviously still not concerned with the value of human life and the only thing that’s saved you is having a past relationship with Bobby and his continued feelings for you.\n\nShe doesn’t look tough, of course looks can be deceiving, but you’re pretty desperate and you REALLY want to leave. When she releases you, you could probably easily grab one of those surgical instruments and hold her hostage until you took her car and got out of this place.\n\nYou’ve no idea where you’d go, but anywhere would be better.\n",
  "page 124": "At this point you’ve come close to death so many times that you’re not scared of dying anymore. If anything it’s amazing you managed to survive as long as you did.\n\nBut you know Julie is scared. She’s scared of a lot of things and if this week is any indication of how shitty the world is going to become, well she’s not going to last very long in it.\n\nIf she walks out that door without even the supplies you came in with, it’ll be like killing her and you can’t let that happen. It is a sad thing that in this late stage you realize you do have feelings for Julie, and it’ll be even sadder for her when she loses you, but hopefully it’ll make her a bit tougher in the long run.\n\n“Julie, take the shot.” You say.\n“Wha…what?!” Julie says.\n“Nice, bluff sis, but it’s not gonna save your ass.” Kelly snorts.\n“It’s not a fucking bluff, you roid rage bitch. I’m telling Julie to shoot your ass and shoot through me if necessary.”\n\nKelly is a bit speechless at this proposal. Julie of course is very upset.\n\n“I…I can’t! I’ll kill you!” Julie cries.\n“I’m already dead Julie. Just take the shot. At least then you’ll have this place all to yourself and can last on the supplies from the shelter in the basement. I’m sure Ben kept a goodly amount.”\n“Suzy…I can’t…I can’t do this without you.”\n“You will…just know that I loved you.”\n\nAt this point Kelly starts looking around in an attempt to find a way to escape while at the same time tightening her grip around your neck. Julie continues to struggle with the morality of all this.\n\n“JULIE TAKE THE FUCKING SHOT!” you manage to shout despite Kelly crushing your throat.\n\nAnd those are the last words you utter as the sound of a shotgun blast follows.\n",
  "page 127": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to total silence for once. No sounds of annoying commercials and no sounds of psychotic family members pointing a gun in your face. Even Julie is still asleep. She’s right next to you on the bed as you sort of figured she would be when you woke up.\n\nYou instinctively reach for your cell phone to check the time, but you don’t currently have it on you. Fortunately there is a large clock on the wall in the room that you’re guessing is accurate.\n\n“Holy shit, why the hell am I up this early?” you say to yourself, but then you remember you fell asleep pretty early yesterday. Really you’re sort of surprised you didn’t wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nYou get up and you’re still hurting, but you’re compelled to go wash yourself since your clothes are caked with dried blood at this point and you’ve been wearing them for a couple days.\n\nJust as you’re about to go test the shower, Julie stirs from her sleep.\n\n“Suzy, what’re doing? You shouldn’t be up and around.”\n“I’m stinking like a dog here, I need to wash up.”\n“You smell fine, I like the way you stink.” Julie says.\n\nYou start laughing.\n\n“Well I’m sure you do, but I really feel like I should… (Sigh) shit.”\n“What?” Julie asks.\n“Don’t have a change of clothes. We got just about everything in this thing except clothing.”\n“So? You don’t need clothing, just go all natural, it’s just us after all. I’ll even join you.”\n“Heh, while I’m sure that kiss from yesterday has got you all revved up, we still need to talk about us in more detail before we start taking it to that level. In the meantime I guess I’m going to have go upstairs to get some clean clothes.”\n“Wait, are you serious?! Those things could be up there!” Julie exclaims.\n“Well that’s why I’m going to be taking some weapons with me.”\n“But you’re wounded! You really shouldn’t be going out there!”\n“While it’s true I ache, I can at least see out both eyes clearly again. Surprisingly I’m feeling slightly energetic. I’ll be careful.”\n“Oh Suzy, (Sigh) I can’t let you go by yourself! I’ll come with you!”\n\nYou and Julie grab a couple of the lighter assault rifles and some ammo and head up the ladder. Really the most nerve-racking part is going to be the initial opening of the hatch since anything could be lurking around ready to attack as soon as you pop your head up.\n\nYou open up the hatch and scramble to the basement floor, looking around in all directions.\n\n“Suzy? Is it safe?” Julie whispers from the ladder.\n“Well if it wasn’t I’m sure they would’ve attacked by now. I don’t even hear any noise from upstairs.”\n“Good, Now your room is right there, just get your clothes and let’s go!”\n“Okay, okay, come on up, I need someone to watch out.”\n\nYou head into your room and Julie climbs up and keeps a nervous eye out. You start going through and grabbing clothing.\n\n“Hey Julie, what about you?” you ask.\n“What about me what?” Julie says.\n“All your clothes are still in your bags upstairs, what are you going to wear?”\n“I don’t know! I’ll wear your clothes or go naked! I’m not heading up there!”\n“Like I said, I don’t even hear any noise and I had quite a few favorite belongings in one of the bags. Fuck it, I’m going up there, I wouldn’t mind seeing Kelly’s body anyway.” You say and pass Julie to head upstairs.\n\nOnce again Julie follows reluctantly.\n\nYou go up the stairs cautiously, once again expecting something to pop out at you. When you finally get up stairs, you expect the same thing, but after checking a bit, nothing is out of place from when you left it yesterday. No broken windows, no kicked in doors, and your bags are still in the same place where you dropped them when you got here.\n\nThen you lay your eyes on Kelly’s body which hasn’t been disturbed in anyway. You didn’t see it when Julie did it since your back was turned, but part of Kelly’s head is splattered on the wall and the rest of it is all over the floor.\n\n“Heh, you blew her fucking head off.” You say.\n“Yeah, it’s really gross. Let’s get our bags and head back, I’m still worried that something might try to break in and I also don’t want to dwell on what almost happened to you in this room. It’s upsetting.”\n“Alright, I just think I needed the closure of seeing her corpse. I know that probably sounds fucked up of me, but then again this whole week has been.” You say grabbing one of your bags.\n\nBefore you or Julie can say anything else a bright flash shines through one of the uncovered windows along with the sound of a large explosion in the distance. You can’t help but take a quick glance out the window.\n\nAnd there you see it in the far distance, the dissipating remnants of a mushroom cloud rising up in the sky.\n\n“…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“Oh shit! We need to get down into the shelter NOW!” Julie exclaims.\n“Let’s get our asses moving then.”\n\nYou and Julie grab your remaining bags and head back into the basement. You don’t stop the haste until you’re safely inside the shelter, though Julie’s still a really stressed.\n\n“Oh shit! Oh shit! We were out there when that bomb went off! What if we’ve experienced a lethal dose of radiation!? I don’t want my hair and teeth to start falling out and coughing up blood! Oh fuck!” Julie starts to say while pacing back and forth.\n“Julie will you relax? First of all if it had been that close the impact should’ve at least shattered the windows of the house. From the direction I saw the cloud, I’d say it probably hit Security City and you know how far away that is. It probably wasn’t even a large one.”\n“So we’re safe?”\n“Well we’re safe from what you’re worrying about yes. But I mean if nukes are going off, that means the end of civilization, as we know it at best. The world is going to become a lot more dangerous.”\n“But we’re in this shelter! We’ve got supplies for years!”\n“Yeah, if we’re smart about conservation we probably can stretch out our supplies for I dare say a decade, but the thing is we’re going to HAVE to explore the surface eventually, if only to gather more food and water. And if we’re going to do that, we’re going to need to prepare ourselves. I foresee a lot of use of that small exercise room in the future unfortunately.”\n\nJulie sits down as if this hard reality is finally hitting her.\n\n“Suzy…I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to survive this new world. I mean if what you’re saying is true, and this week was just an indication of how bad its going to really be, then how useful am I going to be? I mean other than killing your psycho sister; I’ve been completely useless in this crisis. Even with your sister, you came up with the plan to distract her; my dumb ass thought you were being serious at first when you told me to leave. You’ve come up with all the plans and taken all the action. It’s actually very impressive of how you’ve managed to cope with all this…I’m just not as strong as you.”\n\nYou sit down next to Julie and hold her hands.\n\n“Julie, I didn’t say this was going to be easy, but WE can do this. You have to have more faith in yourself Julie. And whether I come up with the plans or not doesn’t mean you’ve been useless. I mean you still needed the courage to pull the trigger to kill Kelly right?” you say.\n“I wasn’t brave, I didn’t want her to kill you.” Julie says.\n“Well I’m sure there’s going to be tons of people wanting to do that to me in the future. So you’ve already proven you’ve got motivation to kill when necessary. And just think you also helped in tricking the National Guard without killing anyone.”\n“Oh sure, just shaking my tits and ass at them. That’s about all I AM actually good at.”\n“Hey whatever works for your survival, but look we’re together now. I need you just as much as you need me. We’re not just friends anymore we have a stronger bond now, one that I want to last for a very very long time. I want to survive to enjoy your company and love for as long as I can. Would you really give up on that so easily?”\n\nJulie smiles.\n\n“No I suppose I can’t. You’re right Suzy. You’re always right.” Julie says and hugs you. She then kisses you on the lips.\n\n“I love you Suzy.” She says.\n“I love you too Julie.” You answer.\n\nA brief pause of you both looking into each other’s eyes and savoring the moment.\n\nWhile the next few moments are going to be filled with possibly the most fun you’ve had this week, you are still thinking about how difficult things are going to be in the near future. Already now, you’re thinking that the first order of business is going to be to get Julie to dry out from her drug abuse. (You can’t afford for her to go through your supply of medical supplies after all) She’s going to probably hate you while she’s detoxing, but it’s going to be for her own good.\n\nAnd that’s just going to be one hurdle you’ll have to jump, but you’re not that “good girl” that hid out in the basement from the rest of the world anymore. You’re ready to face it head on when necessary regardless of the dangers it may hold.\n",
  "page 248": "You aren’t going to stick around to be someone’s lab rat only to probably get disposed of later. And you know enough about the Morningstar family that they’re all a bunch of damn psychos at their core. You need to make your escape now.\n\nLilith undoes your straps and you’re soon free. You sit up, stretch and then make out like you’re about to fall.\n\n“Oh shit.” You say and Lilith quickly comes to your aid to prevent you from “falling.”\n“Whoa, easy there, you o…” Lilith starts to say and then you elbow her in the face.\n\nLilith falls to the floor and you grab a particularly sadistic looking knife from the table. Lilith is remarkable quick to recover because by the time you’ve done all this, she’ already run to the door and opened it.\n\n“LESLIE!” she shouts before you manage to grab her hair and put the knife to her throat.\n“Don’t move. I don’t want to kill you, but I will to get out of here.” You warn.\n“This was a very stupid thing to do Suzy. If you’d cooperated you would’ve gotten out of here in a few days at most. Now you’ve sealed your own death certificate.”\n“Quiet! Now I’m taking your vehicle, so I’m going to need your keys. After I grab those I’ll be leaving and if YOU cooperate you won’t get hurt. So you better tell me where we’re going and NOT shout for help again!” You say.\n“(Sigh) Fine. I have my keys with me in my pocket. We just have to go to the vehicle. This way.” Lilith says and the pair of you leave the room.\n\nYou constantly look around thinking you’re going to see Lilith’s brother coming around a corner, but so far nothing. Lilith tells you which way to go and eventually you’re heading up the stairs. It’s at this point Lilith starts talking shit again.\n\n“You’re not getting away with this you know. My brother’s going to stop you before you can escape and when that happens…well you think things were going bad in your life before? You’re going to soon learn that they’re going to be infinitely worse.”\n“Yeah well I haven’t seen him yet. I guess he didn’t hear you. Probably too busy with his experiments or whatever fucked up shit you two do here. Christ, your family is fucked up.”\n\nLilith laughs.\n\n“Yes, and that apparently that didn’t stop you from dating one of us.” She says.\n“That was different!” you snap.\n“Of course it was. Extreme situations tend to create unusual pairings. Such as the one you and Bobby had. Although I think it was more unusual for him rather than for you given how much of a slave he is to some of my family’s sillier traditions.”\n\nYou get to the ground floor.\n\n“Bobby saved you like some damsel in distress from your mean old serial killer uncle. Makes sense you’d latch on to him the way you did. In a way you’re very much like one of those fairly tale princesses locked away in a tower, except in your case, you locked yourself away in your basement. Bobby was your Prince Charming.”\n\nYou continue to ignore Lilith’s ramblings.\n\n“Now of course you still KNEW what Bobby was, but you willingly looked past that. Why? Was it love? No, even if you thought it was at first. If it was love you would’ve married him in his compound instead of being here. Was it low self esteem? Possibly. But even as introverted as you are, you’re still a very pretty girl and you have to know that on some level…I mean even YOU aren’t that stupid.”\n“Will you shut up?”\n“Not to mention you seem to be fine by yourself. Even Bobby mentioned that you seemed to prefer your own company when you weren’t with him. So where does that leave us Suzy? Why would you willingly date someone from a family as fucked up as ours? Do you know the answer?”\n“Shut the hell up, I don’t care! Just tell me where the front fucking door is!” you exclaim.\n“Next two rooms to the right.”\n\nLilith is quiet again and you make it to the front door. Still no sign of Leslie, so far so good. When you open the door, Lilith once again starts getting chatty.\n\n“Since our time together is almost at an end, I guess I’ll tell you the answer. You went with Bobby because deep down underneath all that apathy you’re just as fucked up as the rest of us.”\n“That’s not even remotely true.”\n“Oh, just because you were merely looking away from my nephew’s murderous deeds, that somehow makes you less fucked up? That’s classic enabling behavior, not to mention your co-dependency during your relationship with Bobby. Hell, before Bobby came into your life, you were pretty detached from the real world and lived in your own made up reality anyway. I’d say under a different sort of extreme circumstance, you’d easily turn into a killer like your uncle especially since from what I’ve heard the rest of your own family isn’t exactly well adjusted either. Didn’t one of them kill his whole family before shooting himself?”\n\nYou press the blade closer to Lilith’s throat to the point that it draws blood.\n\n“You keep talking and you’re going to find that THIS extreme situation is the one that turns me into my fucking uncle, so keep fucking talking and you’re going to be the first fucking victim!”\n\nYour threat finally shuts Lilith up.\n\nYou make your way to the truck, still looking around Leslie, but you don’t see anything. Eventually you get to the truck.\n\n“Alright, very slowly grab the keys out of your pocket. Drop them in my other hand and I’ll release you.”\n\nLilith complies with your orders and as soon as you have the keys you toss her to the ground hard. You then open up the door and suddenly feel a hand grab one of your upper ankles and then a sharp blade cutting into where the tendon would be. You scream out in pain and fall on the driveway pavement. Then another hand grabs your other ankle and you feel a blade cut into your other tendon. Meanwhile Lilith has recovered and taken away the knife you dropped. She stands over you while you scream in pain.\n\nAn older man with completely white and wild hair crawls out from under the truck. He wears a bloody lab coat and goes over to Lilith and asks if she’s okay and remarks on her neck, she nods that she is fine.\n\nYou roll over and try to stand, but find it’s quite impossible with your tendons sliced the way they are. You’re bleeding all over the place and the fear of what’s coming next is overwhelming your physical agony.\n\n“Told you my brother would help me. I knew he would. He’s my Prince Charming after all. Hm. I suppose because it’s drilled into our heads when we’re little that on some level we all like to be rescued. A big strong man charging in to save the day and all that chivalrous patriarchal nonsense, but on some level it’s still sort of hot.” Lilith says and then gives her brother a long kiss and hugs him.\n\nYou try to crawl away, since you can’t even stand at this point, but you don’t get far.\n\n“Too bad nobody’s going to rescue you now though. Should’ve killed me instead of holding back…but then that’s always been your problem isn’t it? Squandering your potential.” You hear Lilith say and then what follows is a hefty kick to the back of your head. You black out.\n\nWhen you wake up you’re firmly strapped to another table completely naked. This isn’t a regular surgical table though since your legs are spread apart.\n\n“Oh…no…NO…NO!” you start to say and try to struggle free.\n\nYour voice calls attention to Leslie who was currently hovering over another body on a different table.\n\n“Oh good, you’re up. I wanted you to be before I started. My sister said it was imperative that you not be unconscious for whatever I have in store for you.”\n\nYou start screaming for help in vain and Leslie goes over to you and starts stroking your head.\n\n“Now she did suggest that one of the things I should do is hand you over to a couple of my redneck assistants and let them have fun with you, but no. After you harmed my sister’s lovely neck with a blade, I think I should have ALL the honors. I’m going to do things. Bad things and I’m going to have fun doing it and nobody is going to stop me. We’ll start off slow.” Leslie says patting your head.\n\nYou begin to cry and for whatever reason in your grasp for hope in this hopeless situation you call out for Bobby.\n\n“Bobby?” Leslie chuckles and then moves over to the part of the table where your legs are spread open and he gets between them while undoing his belt.\n\n“I’m afraid he’s not here to help you blondie. I will say that I’ve never considered this before, but since this is a unique situation… is my dick bigger than my nephew’s? I guess you can be the judge.”\n\nWhat Leslie proceeds to do to you next is horrible and degrading.\n\nThen it gets worse.\n\nAnd worse.\n\nAnd worse.\n\nThe next day, what’s left of you (which isn’t much) is cooked and wrapped up for sandwiches. What isn’t used for lunchmeat is tossed in the trash.\n\nAnd that is the story of you.\n",
  "page 126": "“Julie, go…” you say.\n“Suzy! I can’t leave you here to die!” Julie says.\n“I’m dead anyway. You aren’t going to kill Kelly. At best you’ll probably kill me and blow off one of her arms in the process. After which she’ll probably beat you to death with it, because its obvious she’s got what it takes to survive in this shithole world which is getting shittier everyday.” You say.\n“Heh, damn straight.” Kelly snorts.\n\n“Suzy, I can’t just leave you! I just can’t! I love you!”\n“Yeah… well I don’t fucking love you Julie! I never have and I never will!”\n“But…”\n“Julie just fucking stop! I’m not into girls despite whatever you might be hoping in your heart, so even if you did somehow manage to aim that thing straight and miraculously kill Kelly without hitting me, that still leaves you with NOTHING!”\n\nAt this point Julie starts crying again and barely able to hold up the shotgun. Kelly on the other hand starts chuckling.\n\n“Julie, go on with your fucking life and forget about me.” You say.\n“I…I…can’t. I won’t be able to. I won’t know how! I need you!” Julie stutters. She still doesn’t want to hear the words you’ve said to her.\n“Julie, you’re far more capable than you realize. You’ve faced shit this week that you never expected to and survived. You’ll survive this too.”\n“No…”\n“Julie, look at me. If you REALLY love me as much as you say, you’ll listen to me one last time and get the fuck out of here. Please.”\n\nJulie at this point continues to cry and nods. She slowly starts to walk towards the front door.\n\n“Aww, ain’t this some fuckin’ heart breakin’ shit? Hell, I think I’m about shed a goddamn tear myself…over how fucking pathetically hilarious this is!” Kelly laughs.\n“Kelly will you at least let me give her the keys to the car so she’s got a vehicle to drive away in? They’re in my pocket.” You ask.\n“Sure, sure, anything to get this bitch out of here quicker.”\n\nYou put one hand in your pocket and start fishing around for the keys.\n\n“Just keep moving towards the front door bitch. Your little unrequited crush will throw the keys to you. Heh. And then me and you are going to have quality sister time.” Kelly says.\n\nYou grab the key and slowly pull them out of your pocket.\n\n“Come on, come on, give her the goddamn keys, al…” Kelly says when you blindly swing your arm backwards to try to jam the key into Kelly’s eye.\n\n“AAARGH! FUCK!”\n\nYou’re successful and the piece of metal sinks deep into the orb.\n\nKelly releases her grip just enough for you to slip from her clutches and drop to the floor.\n\n“SHOOT HER NOW!” you yell.\n\nYou see Julie pull the shotgun back up to her shoulder and point it at Kelly. A loud booming noise fills the room when she fires followed by a sickening squishy sound. Blood splatters on you from over head and the slumping of a body falls partially on you.\n\nJulie drops the shotgun and rushes over to help you up.\n\n“Suzy! Oh my god, I was so…” Julie starts to say in between the sobbing.\n“Julie, don’t fuss right now, I’m fine. But right now the pair of us need to get our asses into the basement and look for that shelter entrance. With all the gunfire that went off in here, I’d hate to think what kind of crowd we may have attracted.”\n\nJulie helps you up, but in reality, she’s hurting just as much as you, so you basically prop each other up. You stumble down into the basement and fortunately you don’t even need to search. You see a hatch in the floor that you’ve never seen before wide open and a fluorescent glow of lighting coming from within it. Apparently Kelly didn’t even bother to close up the hidden door.\n\nYou take a look inside and see a long ladder down leading to another floor, which you imagine that’s the main shelter. You can’t believe how close it was to your room and how you never knew about it!\n\n“How the hell did you brother do this with you hearing or knowing about it?” Julie asks.\n“I dunno. I mean he managed to routinely change the entrance all the damn time too. Ben had a gift I guess.” you say and you and Julie start climbing down the ladder and you close up the hatch.\n\nEventually you get to the bottom and you and Julie open up a metal door, which is fortunately not locked.\n\nAnd there it is, you’re in the shelter proper. Before you is a dimly lit living area with various furniture and even a TV. Other rooms include a bathroom, kitchen area, a couple of bedrooms and A LOT of storage rooms. One such room is huge, as rows and rows of canned food and bottled water are found.\n\n“Well looks like we’ll be fine for sustenance for awhile. Doesn’t even look like Kelly put a dent in the supplies.” You say.\n\nAnother storage room contains a goodly amount of ammo and weapons of all kinds. Mostly rifles. Medical supplies are in another.\n\nOne thing that stands out is that Ben’s shelter has solid steel walls. You have no idea how the hell he did this and you guess you never will. You do notice on several of the walls something has been repeatedly scratched out though not entirely successfully everywhere.\n\nAt one point you make out most of it.\n\nPr-p---- o- th- Gr--n- -er- Cor---at-o-\n\n“Well Julie, guess we didn’t have to spend a bunch of money like those fucking commercials always said. Ah, damn it!” You say and hold on to your head, which is still throbbing.\n“Suzy are you okay?”\n“Yeah, I just need to lie down.”\n\nJulie escorts you back to the bedroom where upon you collapse on the king sized bed.\n\n“Oh Suzy, your eye, your face…its so bruised and swollen.”\n“Yeah, I probably look like hell. Guess I’m not very pretty right now.” You laugh.\n\nJulie holds your hand and looks into your one good eye.\n\n“You’ll always be pretty to me.” She says and strokes your hair with her other hand.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence between the pair of you.\n\n“Suzy… when Kelly was holding you hostage, I know you said what you said to trick her into letting down her guard, but… was it really true? I mean it’s fine but I just…”\n\nYou don’t answer her, you instead just grab the back of her head with your other hand and bring her lips directly to your own and kiss her passionately. And this time this isn’t one of those fake kisses to trick the National Guard; you genuinely mean it, because you do have deep feelings for Julie.\n\nWhen you and Julie stop kissing, her eyes are closed and she exhales like a wave of euphoria has just washed over her.\n\n“Well…I guess that answers my question.” She says.\n\n“Ow. Ow. Get up, get up.” You say feeling another wave of pain exacerbated by the fact that Julie is partially on top of you right now.\n“Oh. Sorry! Sorry! You okay?” Julie says getting off of you.\n“Yeah, just still really hurt.” You groan.\n“Yeah so am I actually. Why don’t I try to go find a compress or something for your eye?” Julie says.\n“That’s a good idea. Maybe bring back some painkillers while you’re at it. I’ll just lay here and hurt.”\n\nJulie leaves and you’re left in the room alone. You mainly just lie there, but you do occasionally have the brief thoughts of just how fucked up this week has been. At least you’ve sorted out your feelings for Julie though. Despite the pain, you’re also tired. Really you haven’t even been up that long today in the scheme of things, but being held hostage and getting the shit kicked out of you is enough for you to want to go back to sleep.\n\nBesides, it isn’t like you’ve got anything else to do immediately. You’re safe down here and you’ll have plenty of time to figure out what to do next after some rest.\n\nYou drift off…\n",
  "page 247": "You don’t know the complete lay out of the house and you also don’t really know Lilith excessively well to judge how “tough” she actually is. For all you know she’s got some sort of GZ martial arts training especially given what she’s revealed about what insidious practices they’re doing.\n\nYou also don’t know much about her brother, but he’s probably a damn psycho. If you threatened his sister, he might be capable of anything; you know how close the Morningstar family tends to be after all…\n\nAlso, so far this week, every time you’ve “asserted” yourself, it’s gone very badly. Might be better to at least wait a while and see if a better opportunity comes along and get a feel for this place first.\n\nLilith undoes your straps and you’re soon free. You sit up, stretch and try to maintain composure that you’re not still scared about all this.\n\n“I know the first time we met you were having problems walking by yourself. You okay to do that now? Not still feeling wobbly or anything?”\n“I believe I’m fine. Just very nervous about all this.”\n“Don’t be nervous. As I said, follow the rules and you’ll be fine. If you’re worrying about catching the madness that the town has, well like I said, you’re probably fine, but even if you aren’t I’ve got a few things that might help. You ready to go?”\n“Yeah I guess.” You say and Lilith leads you out the door.\n\nWhen you exit, you find yourself in an uncarpeted corridor with a few rows of doors to the left and right of you (All with very strong looking and very locked doors). It reminds you of a hospital setting; you can’t help but wonder if you’re still in Lilith’s house anymore.\n\n“Um, are we still in your house?” you ask.\n“Oh yes. We’re not on the ground floor if that’s what you’re wondering though, we’re in the basement. Of course this house never had a basement this large originally. A lot of this was added on much later due to my work in GZ. Leslie nearly blew a gasket when he heard workers were coming in to make severe alterations to it, but in time he realized it had its advantages and I told him his area wouldn’t be fussed with anyway. He spends a lot of time down here with his experiments you see and hates change…guess you and he have that in common no?”\n“What?”\n“Well as I said, Bobby told me much about you and your past. Said you preferred to stay down in your basement and hide away from the world and weren’t a fan of change yourself. Was he incorrect in what he told me?”\n“…no…no I suppose he wasn’t. It’s true. I did spend all my time in the basement hiding out from the real world and hated change. This week has been a big wake up call that things couldn’t be like that forever though.” You say.\n“Hm, well don’t despair. While things do eventually change, they can always change for the better. Here’s your new room.” Lilith remarks and unlocks it.\n\nThe door opens up to another windowless room, but this one is much nicer. In fact it’s downright cozy. There’s a sofa, a bookcase with books, a TV…hell it almost reminds you of home. As enter to get a closer look at everything, Lilith is preoccupied with something on her phone.\n\n“Shit, well something came up and we’re going to have to get to the questions later. But for now, what do you think to your new surroundings?” Lilith asks.\n“It’s okay. I didn’t expect to have such a fancy cell.” You say.\n“Suzy! Don’t think of this as a cell, think of it as just a regular room where you’re staying until it’s confirmed you’re okay! Now, if you notice there is another small room off to the right. That’s the bathroom where you’ll find all the usual facilities. I would imagine you’re probably hungry and I’ll be back with some food soon. Just have to deal with something. The National Guard has been deployed in town to maintain order and apparently GZ is sending some of their people to this house as added security. They’re already on their way so I’m going to have to go talk to my brother about this and make sure he curbs his anti-social behavior to a manageable level. Doesn’t help that he’s got those two inbred redneck assistants of his with him right now. I can’t stand those assholes. He’s either going to have to keep them out of sight completely or make them leave…(sigh) Ugh, anyway I’ll be back soon, just make yourself at home.”\n\nLilith closes the door, which you then hear lock and you’re now alone.\n\nYou sit down on the sofa trying to wrap your head around all this. Never in a million years would you have thought you’d be a prisoner by your ex-boyfriend’s aunt who works for the corporation responsible for all those ads on TV and apparently involves in some seriously shady practices. Makes you think about some of those crackpots that posted conspiracy theories on various sites you read. Turns out some of them weren’t too far from the truth after all.\n\nThe thing is, you can’t even worry about something of that magnitude. For one thing, you have absolutely no power to do anything about it and second, you’ve got the more pressing concern about what is going to happen to you.\n\nWhile things are going better than you thought they going to go, you’re still not seeing a good end to any of this. Your luck has been up and down this entire week and just when something good seems to happen, something equally bad happens.\n\nYou don’t trust Lilith completely, no matter how “nice” she’s trying to be. At best Lilith keeps her word and you’re not sick or infected only for her to ultimately execute you “humanely” with shot to your head. You can’t imagine her keeping you alive after telling you her corporation’s secrets like that. Unless of course she thinks you wouldn’t tell anyone and even if you did, who would believe you anyway?\n\nThe darker picture is of course she said the world was going to change very soon implying a nuclear holocaust like all the GZ ads have been harping on about. Maybe she’s told you because ultimately it isn’t going to matter due to doomsday.\n\nIf that’s the case, where is that going to leave you? Maybe Lilith will release you alive, but leaving you to fend for yourself in a blasted wasteland of which you don’t fancy your chances.\n\nAnd these are all the best-case scenarios you’re envisioning, because you don’t even want to think about the worst case, which is undoubtedly going to involve you being in more pain than you could ever imagine.\n\nYou have no more tears for any of this, because you’re spent as far as that’s concerned. You’re still scared of course, but you feel like you’re starting to become numb to very real possibility of death. Doesn’t mean you’re giving up though and you proceed to study your surroundings, taking note of anything you could possibly use as a weapon. You don’t find any secret passages or vents you could crawl around in because that only happens in the movies.\n\nEventually you take a break and lay down on the sofa, which at least is comfortable, you just wish you weren’t wearing a damn hospital gown. You think about turning the TV on, but you figure it will probably just be full of Ground Zero ads.\n\nTime passes and eventually you hear the door opening up. At first you figure it’s going to be Lilith, but it’s not.\n\nTwo dirty looking men open up the door and enter. One of them is huge and has a slackjawed look on his face. He wears overalls that look like they’ve never been washed. The smaller of the two is wearing a mechanic’s jumpsuit and trucker’s cap. When he sees you a big grin spreads across his face making him even creepier than the larger one.\n\n“Hoo wee! Well look at what we got here! Doc really has been fixing up this place, because that is one sweet piece I tell ya what!” the smaller one exclaims.\n\nYou can only guess these must be Leslie’s “assistants.”\n\nYou sit up immediately and try to arrange your gown to cover you as much as possible.\n\n“Didn’t mean to startle ya darlin’ but I’m Jed and this here’s my brother Hugo. What’s yer name and what the hell are you doin’ in here?” the smaller one says.\n“My name’s Suzy, and this is my room. What the hell are YOU two doing in here?”\n“Whoa, easy there blondie. This is where me and Hugo always go to hang out when we’re on standby as it were. No point in headin’ back ta town right now anyway, since it sounds like the shit’s really hit the fan out there, but never mind all that, what’s all this about this bein’ yer room? You some new live in whore for the Doc to fuck when his snooty sister isn’t putting out?” Jed asks.\n\nJed gets closer towards you meanwhile Hugo hasn’t moved from the entryway. You’re feeling very threatened.\n\n“No, I’m Lilith’s guest, now will you please leave my room?” you say.\n“Lilith’s guest? Wait, you sayin’ you HER whore? Well shit, I like the sound of that even better! So you ever been with a guy at all or are you strictly a pussy licker?” Jed asks with a pretty predatory look in his eyes.\n\n“The pair of you better get out of here. Lilith has made it clear she doesn’t want anyone else in here.” You say standing up from the couch.\n“Oh is that right? Well I ain’t heard nuthin’ about it and I take my orders from the Doc, not his snobby bitch of a sister. So I think you better just settle down blondie. In fact, I think you better start making yourself REAL comfortable.” Jed says and starts fondling his crotch while still approaching you.\n\nYou’re steadily running out of options. About the only thing you can do now is either threaten them to the point that they back off or beg and hope they take mercy. Either option isn’t likely to succeed.\n",
  "page 128": "Best Friends With Benefits Forever\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“I hate dealing with those trailer park assholes.” Julie says as you both enter the shelter.\n“Yeah, but unless we want to go driving all the way to the next township or waiting around for a wandering merchant, it isn’t like we got much choice in barter partners.” You say.\n“I just feel like we’re getting eye raped by all of them whenever we walk into their little enclave.”\n“Probably are, but Mel’s pretty good about keeping his boys in line. He’s surprisingly reasonable as well. Besides, they got enough problems ever since the Cult of Tiamat launched a full raid on them.”\n“Yeah, that’s another reason I don’t like going out nowadays, the entire fucking town is a war zone between those two.”\n“Mmm, I’m just glad we don’t live where the fighting has gotten the heaviest. It’s almost like how it was when all those people were running around like rabid animals. Still never learned what caused that, weird that some people just suddenly went back to normal though.”\n“Speaking of the cult, do you really believe they won’t attack us anymore?” Julie says.\n“Well like with anything in this shitty world, nothing is certain, but Bobby has always been a true believer so when he came to us that night saying that Tiamat spoke to him in a dream saying that we were off limits due to recent losses, I’m inclined to believe we don’t need to worry about them for now. Personally I think it was that bitch Diana that kept targeting us specifically for sacrifice. She never did like me. Anyway Diana’s dead and Bobby isn’t under her influence anymore.”\n“What about his new first wife though?”\n“His sister Helen? I only met her a few times back when I was dating Bobby, but she was always okay to me. Seemed to almost want me in the fold as it were. Probably wanted an ally because her older sister Diana was a bully to her…hmm might’ve had something common I suppose.”\n\nAs you get ready to relax for the night, Julie ceases talking for a moment and then speaks up again.\n\n“Hey, do you ever wonder what your life would’ve been like if you’d stayed with Bobby?” Julie asks.\n“You’re joking right?” you say.\n“Well I’m just asking do you think it would’ve been easier?”\n“I really don’t see how being the member of an insane cult would’ve been easier and that’s not even factoring in Diana who probably would’ve been trying to kill me at every turn.”\n“Ah, I think you would’ve been okay. You would’ve found a way to get over on her. Just think you would’ve been a high priestess with followers or something!”\n“And I still would’ve had to have shared Bobby with Helen and whatever other sisters he choose as a damn wife. Nope, I’m not into polygamy.”\n“But you weren’t into girls either at one time and we wound up together.”\n“That’s a little different Julie, we had a long history. I mean I don’t even see you as a female. I mean I do, but (Sigh) …you know what I mean! I’m just saying I’m not the sharing type when it comes to these things. What brought all this weird line of questioning all of a sudden?”\n“I dunno, I guess sometimes I play what if and I come up with all sorts of weird scenarios.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well okay for example, I can picture you still doing okay even if you made different choices in your life. Like I can picture you surviving and even thriving in this harsh world regardless of what you did. Me? I would’ve been dead without you around. I just wonder sometimes if your life would’ve been better without me. Silly I suppose for me to dwell on stuff like that.”\n\nYou know Julie can still get a little self-conscious at times and would seem tonight is one of those nights. It was annoying at first, but as time has gone on, you’ve actually grown to find it a little endearing.\n\n“You’re damn right it’s silly, because how could my life be better without you? I mean I have everything I want with you, what more could I want? To be a leader of one of the many dysfunctional groups out there? No thanks, I was already part of one dysfunctional group, I don’t need to be part of another, let alone trying to lead them. I’m perfectly happy down here in our shelter with ample supplies and spending the rest of my years with you. Now come over here.”\n\nJulie walks over to you a bit demurely and you passionately kiss her and grab her ass in the process.\n\n“Mmm. Tell you what, since the town has become rather dangerous lately, why don’t we stay in for a month or two? Maybe by that time, those idiots will have stopped or killed each off by then. You know we still have lots of supplies left, we can afford a nice romantic vacation of sorts from the world.” You say.\n“See, you always have the good ideas.” Julie says with a smile.\n\nAs the two of you embrace in the way lovers do, you realize Julie is right, you do have all the good ideas.\n\nAnd your best one was choosing to be with your best friend.\n",
  "page 77": "Weird or not, you’re not going to just let him potentially get shot.\n\n“Johnny! You can’t go out the front door! Look, just lie down on the couch okay? You can sleep here. It’ll be all right.” You say getting up and grabbing his arm.\n\nJohnny stares at your hand and then at your face.\n\n“Do you mean it?” Johnny asks.\n“Of course, I can’t let you go out there and get shot. I mean if you still want to leave then at least wait until its night and you’ve had some sleep.” You answer.\n“You’re so…so perfect…” Johnny remarks and starts to head back towards the couch.\n\nYou help Johnny back to the couch, and when he lies down he falls asleep almost immediately.\n\n“I…love you Suzy…” he says as he drifts off.\n\nWell there was nothing ambiguous about that. You start wondering if you should have your head examined for possibly enabling a possibly mentally unstable guy who’s more than a little obsessed with you.\n\n“(Sigh) What the hell is wrong with you Suzy? First it was a cultist, now it’s this stalker. Are you deliberately picking crazy people as potential boyfriend material?” you say to yourself.\n\nYou stand over Johnny watching him sleep for more than a few minutes trying to figure out where you actually stand with this guy. As you do so you never noticed how cute he really is before. It’s true that he’s somewhat average looking, but maybe it’s due to him being in a more vulnerable position that he’s coming off as more attractive and not creepy.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, you turn down the TV (Which is blaring a Ground Zero infomercial as usual) and leave Johnny to sleep. You stop in the kitchen first in the hopes of maybe finding food before returning to your own room.\n\n“Wow, this place was a mess last night. How the hell did he get it so clean?” you say as the kitchen is indeed much tidier without drunken fools and broken tables lying on the floor.\n\nWhen you open up the refrigerator, you surprisingly find another pizza box, which has been marked with a note saying “Property of Suzy, don’t touch!” Johnny must’ve ordered another one for you last night in case you got hungry later. That was pretty thoughtful, but what surprises you even more is its completely intact.\n\n“He probably was acting like a guard dog all night near the refrigerator in case someone tried to eat it.” You laugh to yourself.\n\nGrabbing cold pizza and an unopened drink you head back to your room and lock the door.\n\nStill wondering about them, you call up Julie, Donna and even Peter, but you get no answer from any of them.\n\nJust as you briefly pondering about calling Kelly too, you hear a loud banging on a door. Not the door to your room, but somewhere in the house. Upon exiting your room, it sounds like its coming from the front door.\n\nYou remember that the loudspeaker from earlier did say there was going to be a government representative coming to visit the houses in the neighborhood.\n\nYou enter the living room and find Johnny awake again. He still looks pretty tired.\n\n“Wha…what’s going on?” he asks, rubbing his eyes.\n“I think it’s the government rep.” you say, then you run over to the door and check through a window and see a well dressed man and one soldier at the door. You grab the handle…\n\n“Wait, you’re just going to let them in?” Johnny asks.\n“Well I doubt if they’re going to just go away. What can we do? Barricade ourselves in until they bash the door down? I don’t like it either, but it isn’t like we have too many options. Besides I don’t have anything to hide, do you?”\n“No.” Johnny replies.\n“Well there you go then, we might even be able to find out some answers too.”\n\nYou open up the door.\n\n“Greetings miss. I’m Mr. Zoll and I’ve been assigned to be the government representative for this area. May we come in?” Mr. Zoll asks, though it’s pretty obvious that this is more of a polite formality rather than asking permission.\n“Of course.” You answer and let Mr. Zoll and his soldier companion in.\n\nWhen you turn around you see that Johnny is sitting up on the couch, but is propping his head up on the armrest. He’s still really sleepy so you’re not surprised to see a bit of a scowl from him. You just hope the others don’t take it the wrong way, but you figure as long as you’re polite and upfront, you shouldn’t have too many problems.\n\nMr. Zoll sits on the chair while his soldier buddy stands nearby (eyeing Johnny mostly) you sit on the other side of the couch with a space between you and Johnny and ask what all this is about.\n\n“My name’s Suzy, and that’s Johnny over there. So how can we help exactly?” you ask.\n“Well, before we start I know this isn’t an ideal situation. You’re probably already concerned about what’s going on and why this town is under marshal law in the first place.” Mr. Zoll answers.\n“It is all a bit worrying.” You reply.\n“I’m sure. Unfortunately I can’t talk about it too much, however I’m sure you’re aware that this town has experienced a vast increase in criminal activity and rioting. More than your police force can handle. So until we get the situation under control again, we’re here to stay.”\n“Well we certainly can understand that. We haven’t experienced any criminal activity in this neighborhood though, well at least not to my knowledge.”\n“Hmm, yes this is one of the quieter ones. Some places I’m hearing about are pretty bad. Anyway I’d like to ask a few questions before deciding if we need to search this house further.”\n“Oh. Um, okay then. We have nothing to hide.”\n“Good glad to… hear it.” Mr. Zoll says glancing over at Johnny who is still alternating between being sleepy and unhappy about being awake.\n“So which one of you owns this place?”\n“My friend Julie.”\n“Oh? Neither of you are the owner? Where is this Julie?”\n“Uh, don’t know. She skipped out on her own party yesterday and never came back home. Isn’t that what you said Johnny?”\n“Hrm. Yeah.” Johnny mumbles.\n“I see…” Mr. Zoll says studying Johnny though you don’t know why. It’s making you nervous though.\n\n“Is this man your boyfriend?” Mr. Zoll suddenly asks.\n“Um…yes! Yes he is. He hasn’t had much sleep. You see we had a party last night and he stayed up late cleaning up. He really shouldn’t have, but that’s just how he is!” you nervously laugh being completely caught off guard by the question.\n\nIn your mind you already are regretting saying that since you’ve sent out more than enough mixed messages to Johnny. Though when you look over at Johnny he doesn’t make any facial signs of a positive or negative nature, he’s too busy on struggling to stay awake.\n\nMr. Zoll is now looking at you a bit mistrustfully. He thinks something is wrong and now that you’re shifting a bit uncomfortably, he starts to think you’re covering up something even though you aren’t!\n\n“Okay, you know what. I think it’ll be easier to just give a brief search of the house.” Mr. Zoll says standing up to say.\n“Um, all right then. We have nothing to hide as I said.” You say. Johnny slightly awakens a bit at this remark, but otherwise he continues to say nothing.\n\nMr. Zoll tells his man to go take a quick look through all the rooms while the three of you stay in the living room. The soldier nods and follows his orders. He first goes upstairs and looks through. You half expect him to find a stash of drugs in Julie or Donna’s room, but he either doesn’t or that isn’t their primary concern.\n\nNext the soldier comes back downstairs and searches the ground floor, but once again finds nothing that is going to get you into trouble. Johnny briefly turns his head to watch the soldier as he moves back and forth up and down the hallway.\n\n“Searched everywhere sir, well except the basement.” The soldier says when he comes back.\n“Well you might as well search that too.” Mr. Zoll remarks.\n\nThe soldier nods and heads back towards the hallway. Johnny doesn’t look at the soldier this time, he just closes his eyes.\n\nYou hear the door open to the basement and then a few footsteps going down, then all of a sudden…\n\n“Oh shit! That basement has a bad step!” Johnny exclaims and goes running down the hallway and shouts at the soldier.\n\nMr. Zoll gets up and starts to yell at Johnny to come back and you call out to him as well. This is soon followed by both the soldier and Johnny yelling and then the sound of someone falling down the stairs.\n\nAt this point you and Mr. Zoll both run towards the basement and there you see Johnny in the stairwell and the soldier crumpled in a heap at the bottom. His neck doesn’t look like it’s supposed to be twisted that way.\n\n“I…I tried to stop him from falling…” Johnny exclaims looking distressed.\n“His fucking neck is broken! I can see it from here! You killed him!”\n“I didn’t! I tried to save him! I shouted about the step!”\n“Bullshit! And YOU’RE lying too!” Mr. Zoll says pointing to you as well. “Something fishy is going on here and I dunno what it is, but BOTH of you are going to pay for it!”\n\nMr. Zoll reaches for something in his suit pocket…\n\nPanic washes over you and it’s in situations like this that sometimes people either freeze up or make a rash decision.\n",
  "page 76": "As much you don’t necessarily relish the idea of possibly sending a man to his death, he’s not your responsibility and it’s already weird he’s been sticking around when there isn’t anyone else here maybe it would be best if you let him leave especially if he’s implying that he’s mentally ill.\n\nBesides if he claims he can sneak past the National Guard, then who are you to disbelieve him.\n\n“Okay, but you probably should go out the backdoor at least.” You say.\n“Yeah, good idea. You’re so thoughtful to look out for my well being. I just wish…things could’ve been different…” Johhny says and starts stumbling back towards the kitchen.\n\nYou follow Johnny just to make sure he doesn’t fall or something similar. When you reach the kitchen you’re impressed with how clean it is. You’d never know there was a drunk fool lying on a broken table yesterday.\n\n“How the hell did you get this so clean?” you ask.\n“Oh, I’m very (yawn) good at cleaning. Always have been. There’s also some pizza and another drink for you in the fridge. I got an (yawn) extra one yesterday in case you got hungry today. Don’t worry, I made sure nobody touched it.”\n“Wow Johnny, that was pretty thoughtful. Thank you.”\n“No problem. I just hope someone will be as good to you as you deserve. Goodbye Suzy.” Johnny says and walks out the backdoor.\n\nYou walk to the door and peer out the window to see if he’s going to jump the fence, but you see him walk around the house. You hope he isn’t going to try to go through the front gate again and is just going to cut through a neighbor’s yard.\n\nYou run back to a couple of other rooms peering out windows, but you don’t see him anymore. You look out one of the front windows and he’s not out there either. He must’ve already made his escape you guess or at least you hope so.\n\nLacking any other ideas of what to do at this particular time, you grab the pizza and drink from the fridge and head back to your room. You also attempt to call up Donna, Julie and even Peter to see if you can find out more information on their situations, but you get no answer from any of them.\n\nAfter passing some time on your laptop, you suddenly hear a loud banging on a door.\nNot the door to your room, but somewhere in the house. Upon exiting your room, it sounds like its coming from the front door.\n\nYou remember that the loudspeaker from earlier did say there was going to be a government representative coming to visit the houses in the neighborhood.\n\nYou head to the living room and look through the door window and see a well-dressed man and one soldier at the door.\n\nSince you get the impression the government will most likely just break the door down if you don’t answer the best thing you can do is be polite and accommodating.\n\nYou grab the handle…\n\n“Greetings miss. I’m Mr. Zoll and I’ve been assigned to be the government representative for this area.

She skipped out on her own party yesterday and never came back home. She’s a bit of a free spirit.”\n“Hmmm…” Mr. Zoll says and begins to write something down.\n“Why are you writing? Did I say something wrong? I mean not that I meant to say anything is wrong, that is. Everything is just fine! Ha ha.”\n\nMr. Zoll’s staring and questioning makes you nervous and now Mr. Zoll is looking at you a bit mistrustfully. He thinks something is wrong and now that you’re shifting a bit uncomfortably, he starts to think you’re covering up something even though you aren’t!\n\n“Okay, you know what. I think it’ll be easier to just give a brief search of the house.” Mr. Zoll says standing up to say.\n“Um, all right then.

You hear the door open to the basement and then a few footsteps going down and then nothing.\n\nYou and Mr. Zoll sit in silence for a while. You don’t say anything, in fact you don’t even look in his direction for fear of giving Mr. Zoll an excuse to do something else which might not be as pleasant as a simple search.\n\n“Where the hell is he…shouldn’t be taking this long… Jacobs! Jacobs! Did you find anything?! Because if not, we’ve got other houses to go to!” Mr. Zoll shouts.\n\nThere is no answer. Mr. Zoll calls again and still nothing. Mr. Zoll looks at you as if it’s your fault.\n\n“Is there someone down there?” Mr. Zoll asks.\n“What? No! I mean isn’t your man Jacobs the only one down there?” you say nervously.\n“That’s what I’m asking you…let’s go find out shall we?” Mr. Zoll says and then turns your nervousness into flat out fear by suddenly pulling out a pistol from his suit pocket.\n\nYou put up your hands and attempt to say you have no idea what’s going on, but Mr. Zoll won’t hear it, he’s convinced you’re hiding someone in the basement and you’re going first down there. He also tells you to be completely quiet and not make any fuss or else he’s just going to shoot you on the spot and have a squad come in and burn this place to the ground.\n\nMeekly you comply and you head towards the basement with Mr. Zoll pointing his gun at you from behind.\n\nYou reach the bottom of the stairs and you notice blood on the floor nearby and then suddenly a knife is plunged into your throat from an arm around the corner.\n\nYou fall to the floor in what almost feels like slow motion as you gurgle your last words and breathe your last breaths.\n\nWith your last vision from the cold basement floor, you think you see Johnny standing over you. You can’t hear him, but he’s obvious upset when he sees you. Then you see a burst of blood come out of his head and then you feel the heavy weight of his body collapse on top of you before the darkness envelopes your world.\n",
  "page 79": "The panic is overwhelming and you completely freeze up. Even when Mr. Zoll pulls a pistol out of his pocket you still do nothing. It’s like the next few moments are in slow motion to you.\n\nYou watch Johnny attempt to run up the stairs, but Mr. Zoll turns quickly and fires two shots, one in Johnny’s chest and another in his head. Johnny falls backwards down the stairs and his body falls in heap on top of the dead soldier.\n\nYou don’t even scream when seeing this, but your crippling frozen panic ends and you instantly make a run for it. Mr. Zoll attempt to grab you, but you’re too fast.\n\nYou actually get to the front door before you hear Mr. Zoll tell you to halt or he’ll fire. You can’t stop though, you’re too afraid for your life.\n\nUpon opening the door, you feel a piece of hot lead going into your back and then another.\n\nYou slump face first onto the front porch. Tears in your eyes and screaming from the pain you attempt to drag yourself forward, but it’s all for naught. Mr. Zoll casually walks up to you and ends your suffering with a final bullet to the head.\n",
  "page 71": "You decide that keeping a bit of distance from Julie might be for the best for now. After last night you don’t want her to think you’re lingering around her because there is something there between you two.\n\nJohnny seems a bit odd, but then you’re certainly used to odd people. You grab a trash bag and start cleaning up left over beer cans.\n\n“Thanks, but you don’t need to help me. Your girlfriend probably could use the help more than I do.” Johnny says.\n“Well I do live here now, so it’s gotta get clean or I’m living in a pig pen! And Julie isn’t my girlfriend.” You say.\n“Oh. Sorry, I just assumed that you two coming out of the same room together…”\n“Eh, long story. But she’s just my friend and I consoled her on a troubling topic. It got emotional and she slept in my room, though I’m fairly certain Julie wishes it had gone farther.”\n“Hm, I see. Well your sister didn’t mention you had a girlfriend when she spoke about you last night, so I was sort of wondering.”\n“Wow, I must’ve really pissed my sister off yesterday if she was talking about me to a stranger. Would’ve thought she would’ve been focusing on other things during a party. What exactly did she say?”\n“Are you sure you want to know?” Johnny asks.\n“It probably isn’t going to be anything I haven’t already heard before from her, so go ahead.”\n“Well…she was sort of drunk when she started talking to me. I was actually surprised, since a girl like her doesn’t normally just go up and talk to a guy like me, well at least not when there are other guys around. Anyway, she at first propositioned me to go into the basement with her. When I declined, she got more hostile and started calling me a faggot and said I didn’t know how to have fun just like her sister Suzy.”\n“And that’s when she went on a tirade?”\n“Yeah, I was about to leave her since it isn’t my idea of a good time to be ranted at and insulted, but she grabbed my arm and practically forced me to listen. She went on about you being good and perfect and never doing anything wrong. Basically she said all this stuff about you as if they were supposed to be bad things, but I didn’t see it. I guess that just made her even madder so she eventually told me to fuck off and later on I saw her leave with that group I mentioned earlier.”\n“Yeah sounds like her. (Sigh) I jut hope she hasn’t gone and done anything more stupid than usual. Family. What can ya do?” you say.\n“Heh, don’t need to tell me. I had an older sister just like your younger one. Partied all the time, lot of sex, lot of drugs, pissed my mom off something fierce when we were still living with her.” Johnny says continuing to pick up cans and placing them in a bag.\n“Oh I got an older sister too, but she’s even worse than Donna.”\n“Party girl too huh?”\n“No, she’s just a fucking sadistic bully. Had to put up with her abuse for years.”\n“Your older sister sounds like my mother.”\n\nWhile the tone of his voice reflects no anger though, you notice when Johnny mentions that, his hand crushes one of the beer cans he has. He looks at it briefly and then tosses it in the bag.\n\nYou wonder if you should stop talking altogether, but Johnny has already noticed that you’ve been staring at what he’s done.\n\n“Sorry, bad memories. I didn’t meant to scare you there.” Johnny says.\n“I wasn’t scared, just more surprised. We can get off the topic of families.”\n“Heh, actually I was thinking we were kind of bonding a bit. Sounds like both of us come from fucked up families. Probably made us stronger right?”\n“I dunno. I mean I suppose I’ve survived, not sure if that’s the same thing. I mean this is like the second day I’ve spent away from home. I only moved out yesterday and only then due to being under duress from my sister Kelly. I’ve always been a bit introverted and spent most of my life avoiding the outside world.”\n“Eh, you’re not missing much. To be honest, I’m almost jealous you managed to do it for so long. I’m a bit of an introvert too, but occasionally I to mix with the crowd as it were. Just to see if I feel any different. Hence one of the reasons why I came to your friend’s party last night.”\n“And?”\n“And, I don’t feel any different. Just like I figured. It’s like I spoke with several other people last night even before your sister and everyone was just…dull…boring…like they were just empty shells. Like they weren’t even real people to me. To be quite honest before your sister started complaining about you to me, I was getting bored and nearly left the party.” Johnny says as he motions over to a few of the sleeping lumps still in the living room.\n“What about your friend that you came with?”\n“Oh him? I came here independently of him. Hell, he didn’t even show up. Really, he’s more of an acquaintance than a friend anyway…”\n\nJohnny’s eyes sort of glaze over when he says this and he breaks in the middle of his sentence. Almost like he’s in a different “place.” ‘\n\n“Johnny?” you say.\n“Hrm? Sorry, I just kind of spaced out there. Anyway as I was saying, you haven’t missed much by not being a social butterfly, I think this group here is proof of that. And as far as not being strong, you’re stronger than you think. Despite coming from a dysfunctional family, you haven’t succumbed to drug and sex filled escapism like your younger sister and you obviously haven’t grown to become a mean bully like your older sister. The fact that you told me you spent the night consoling your best friend rather than indulging in some sort of meaningless hedonistic pleasure tells me that you’re a kind and gentle soul. That’s a rarity in this shitty world.”\n\nYou have to admit, as strange as this Johnny is, you do get the sense he’s being genuine when he says this to you.\n\n“Well thank you Johnny.” You say.\n\nJust as you’re about to converse more with him, you hear some loud noise coming from the second floor. You hear a man’s voice and a female voice, and then a very familiar voice. Sounds like Julie and it sounds like she’s gone back to distracting herself from last night’s concerns.\n\n“Oh yes! Ohhhh yeah! Give it to me daddy!” you hear Julie scream.\n\nA little disturbing choice of words considering what you both talked about last night.\n\nSome of the people sleeping in the living room are even awakened by this. One of them looks at his watch and immediately runs out the front door like he’s late for something. A couple of others return to sleep.\n\n“Sounds like your friend is feeling better.” Johnny says a little disdainfully.\n“Mm, well she always was one to get over things quickly. Well looks like we’re all done in this room anyway.”\n“Yeah, hey why don’t you take a break? I mean obviously we don’t need to clean this place spotlessly. Your friend Julie is just going to have another party tonight right?” Johnny says.\n“True. Yeah, I guess you’re right. No point in me cleaning especially if Julie isn’t even going to be helping anymore, but what about you?” you ask.\n“Me? Well I’m just going to dump out the trash and maybe pick up a few more of the bottles in the kitchen on the way. I’ll probably also take another pursue down in the basement. It was a mess down there, but I think I cleaned most of it. Nearly tripped on a bad step down there though. Anyway then I guess I’ll head home, I need the sleep anyway seeing as I haven’t been yet.”\n“You didn’t sleep here?”\n“Nope. I’ve been awake the whole time, but I find I’m more of a night owl and don’t sleep much anyway.”\n“Well I understand that, but I’m just surprised you stayed. You told me you were getting bored with the party and were about to go home at one point.”\n“Ah, but I also mentioned that after your sister complained about you to me, my interest was increased.” Johnny says.\n\nYou pause because you almost can’t believe what he’s implying.\n\n“Wait a minute. Are you saying you just stayed at the party through the night AND this morning just to meet me at some point? Just solely based on what my sister bitched about to you?”\n“What can I say? You sounded interesting and after speaking with you I can see I wasn’t wrong.”\n\nJohnny smiles and you smile with a nervous laugh. On one hand it’s a little stalkerish and combined with Johnny’s oddness, he’s starting to come off a lot creepier.\n\nOn the other hand, in a strange way you’re sort of flattered. You always did attract the weird ones Suzy.\n\n“Wow…I’m not exactly sure what to say to that.” You say.\n“No need to say anything. The pleasure of speaking with you is all mine. Oh but one more thing, did you want me to get rid of these useless sloths still sleeping in the living room before I leave?”\n“Well, they’re probably just going to be here for tonight’s party, so might as well just leave ‘em I suppose. No need to trouble yourself.”\n“Okay then, as I said, it was nice talking with you Suzy.”\n“It was…interesting talking with you too Johnny.” You reply back and head towards your room as Johnny starts taking a couple of garbage bags to the kitchen.\n\nWhat a strange person. Even stranger is that your self-esteem has been a little boosted by Johnny’s stalkerish behavior.\n\nBefore Johnny’s praising of you, in the back of your mind you were still a little upset about Bobby and starting to realize you were alone again. Not that you had any major problems with being alone and you’re certainly used to it, but it still was nice to have a boyfriend every now and then.\n\nAfter Johnny going on about how most people suck and putting you on a minor pedestal you don’t feel as bad anymore about Bobby. Screw him right? He’s the one missing out.\n\nYou enter your room and lock your door fully content on tuning out the rest of the world like you always do. You go back to fucking around on the Internet, playing games and when the mood strikes you, getting out your mechanical “boyfriend” who never disappoints you.\n\nHours pass…\n\nEventually the silence from outside your door becomes less silent. Looks like Julie’s party is getting started or at least getting louder.\n\nYou don’t really pay it too much mind as you pretty much managed to block it somewhat yesterday, but then you get a knock on the door.\n\n“Julie?” you ask instinctively.\n“Um, no it’s me.” A familiar voice answers.\n“Johnny?” you say and then slowly get up to answer the door.\n\nYou open it up a little and see Johnny standing before you (Along with some party people passing by in the hallway).\n\n“Hi again.” He says with a brief smile.\n\n“What are you doing here? Did you even go home?” you ask.\n“Oh yeah, I did, but just as I was finishing up in the kitchen, your friend Julie had come in to get some more booze. She mentioned that she appreciated my cleaning up and invited me back for tonight’s party. So I came back.”\n“Really?”\n“Well technically she also invited me to come join her and the couple up in her room, but I declined as you might aspect. Not an orgy guy.”\n“Yeah, which is why I’m really wondering why you came back at all. I mean I have to live here, but this really isn’t your thing. You said as much earlier today.”\n“I know what I said…but I also said…”\nJohnny’s expression becomes… not quite flustered, not quite angry, but more like he’s having a hard time and you’ve just put him on the spot.\n\n“(Sigh) Look. This is really difficult for me. I’m probably coming off like a creepy stalker and god knows you probably get a lot of guys hitting on you…but I like you. I know that sounds like third grade shit, but there it is. I really like you and I’d like to get to know you better. That’s why I came back tonight.”\n\nOddly that was honest enough to actually be kind of charming. Lot better than the “Show us your tits” pick up line that you’ve heard before.\n\nThen again, Johnny is still pretty damn weird and much like how you didn’t want to lead on Julie; you don’t necessarily want to lead Johnny on either.\n",
  "page 70": "While Johnny seems okay, you don’t know him and you’re not in the mood to make new acquaintances, so to prevent the risk of him suddenly becoming more talkative to you, you pass Johnny and head upstairs to help Julie.\n\n“Hey! Not cool Julie, we were asleep!” you hear a voice say.\n“Yeah and nobody has sex in MY bed unless I’m actually in it!” Julie says.\n“Well, you can still join us like last time…” another voice says.\n“Get out!”\n\nThis order is followed by the sounds of something falling on the floor, and then followed by some complaints.\n\nSoon you see a disheveled man and woman both putting some clothes on as they exit the room. They walk past you, grumbling the whole time about Julie not being cool about the situation.\n\nAs they walk out the front door, they end up waking up another guest who was sleeping in one of the chairs downstairs. He looks at his watch and exclaims “Shit!” and rushes out the door as well. Johnny briefly looks at them and then looks up at you with a faint smile and continues to quietly clean up.\n\nYou enter Julie’s room and see her stripping the bed.\n\n“Well, could’ve been worse I suppose. I thought you were cleaning up downstairs.” Julie asks.\n“I figured I’d help you up here.” You answer.\n“Oh, well thanks.”\n“Plus, I dunno, but that Johnny guy is sort of weird.”\n“Heh, yeah, but no weirder than some of the other people we’ve both known.”\n“I suppose, but there’s something about him…I can’t place my finger on it. I’m just not getting the best of vibes from him.”\n“Well he did say he didn’t get out much. Maybe he’s just awkward around people. I think you know a little about that.” Julie says smirking.\n“Heh, very funny. So did you want me to get started on the other rooms?”\n“Yeah just pick up any trash you might find and throw that away in a trash bag. There should be some up here in the hallway closet. Don’t worry about the bathroom, I’m sure its suitably disgusting, but I wouldn’t dream of asking you to clean it. Hey, maybe I can get Johnny to do it. Ha ha!”\n“What about Donna’s room?”\n“Well, normally I leave her shit alone so she has the privacy of cleaning it herself if she so desires. Of course I don’t think picking up a few beer cans that might be in there to be an invasion of privacy. So use your judgment.”\n\nSo you do exactly what Julie says. You start picking up cans and other refuse into a trash bag. Despite Julie’s warnings, you check the bathroom anyway and it isn’t quite that bad so you do a little cleaning up there as well.\n\nEventually you make your way back to Julie’s room where she’s still straightening things out there.\n\n“You know normally I never bother to do this much cleaning, but I guess that’s one of the advantages of not being hung over when you wake up in the afternoon. You finished already?” Julie asks.\n“Just about, even worked on the bathroom a little. Wasn’t that bad in there.”\n“Glad to hear it, did you clean up Donna’s room?”\n“No, decided to stick with your policy of non-interference.”\n“Okay. (Whew) I’m used to playing hard, but not working hard. I’m taking a break.”\n“Yeah I think I’ll join you.”\n\nJulie lies down on her now fresh-sheeted bed, while you sit in a chair.\n\n“Why don’t you come over here, you could stretch out.” Julie says.\n“Hm, I’m good. And I think we’ve spent enough time in beds together for a while.” You answer.\n“Afraid you might get the sudden urge to spoon me again huh?”\n“Look, I dunno how I got in that position, but I probably was dreaming or something.” You say.\n“Mostly or something.” Julie continues to prod. “You had me in a pretty good grip and I didn’t say this before, but I was wide-awake for a good ten minutes enjoying it before I had to really pee. And during that time, you were also grinding your body into mine and you even gave me a peck on the ear.”\n“What?! Get out of here! You’re making this up!” you exclaim.\n“I’m serious!”\n“…I like guys!” you protest.\n“I never said you didn’t. I’m just saying that on SOME level, you might like the female form as well. It’s okay you know.”\n“The only female form I like is my own.”\n“So you really mean to say you’ve never fantasized about another woman? I’m not even talking about me, I’m talking about any woman.”\n“Nope, can’t say that I have.”\n“You’ve never found any woman attractive?”\n“Well that’s different than wanting to fucking another woman. I mean sure, if you want an example I always thought my older brother Ben’s wife Moonshadow had pretty eyes.”\n“Hmm, interesting. She was part black wasn’t she? Maybe you just got a thing for dark meat.” Julie laughs.\n‘Fuck you Julie. Just fuck you.”\n“Hey, whenever you’re ready. And given how much you were aggressively holding on to me and grinding your body into mine, I at least I know you’re a top now. Didn’t get that vibe from you before. That’s kind of hot really.”\n\nAt this point you can’t help but laugh though it’s a semi-nervous laugh due to feeling a little weird about Julie’s suggestions about you. You attempt to change the subject.\n\n“Well at least this has gotten my mind off other things. Still need to smooth things over with Donna though. No call yet, so I’m guessing she didn’t get arrested. I’m just hoping it isn’t something worse. I might call her soon; even if she is pissed at me at least I’ll know where she is. Has she ever disappeared like this before?”\n“Oh sure. I mean she goes over to hang out with other people; she’s probably over at one of their houses. I’m sure she’ll be back later today…is that Johnny guy still downstairs?”\n“Dunno. I can check.”\n\nYou exit Julie’s room and look into the living from the second floor. The TV is still on (And still playing an infernal Ground Zero infomercial) but Johnny isn’t anywhere in sight. Looks like the living room is clean though, even the last of the sleeping “guests” are gone. You call out his name, but there is no answer.\n\n“Nope, he’s gone. Looks like everyone is gone.” You say entering Julie’s room again.\n“Oh well. With as helpful as he was cleaning up I hoped I could get him to drag these dirty sheets and blankets to the washing machine. You gonna help?”\n“I suppose I could, but I probably should be searching for a job. I have a terrible habit of not focusing at the best of times on that.”\n“Heh, I don’t even think I’ve ever looked for one…and I probably should start doing so. Like I said yesterday, my inheritance isn’t going to last forever. I won’t keep you though, you’ve been a big help already and I can handle taking some sheets down to the washing machine.”\n\nYou suddenly get the idea that maybe the task wouldn’t seem quite as bad if you did it together. To be honest you wouldn’t mind her with you while you look if only because you still don’t want to be by yourself where you can start dwelling on Bobby again or worse trying to call him.\n\nOf course you might end up just goofing off with Julie if she’s around thus procrastinating and making the goal of searching for a job pointless.\n",
  "page 72": "What the hell, you weren’t doing anything important with your time and you were thinking about making the first move yourself earlier today.\n\n“Johnny, could you hold on one moment?” you ask.\n“Um, okay.” He replies.\n\nYou close the door again and hastily clean up your room a bit just so you don’t have your underwear just lying around, let alone your vibrator. Feeling that your room and yourself are presentable, you open the door.\n\n“Come on in Johnny.” You say.\n“Wait, you’re inviting me into your room? Are you sure?” Johnny asks a bit surprised.\n“Well if we’re going to get to know each other better to see if we’ve got potential, then I’d rather do it in here one on one rather than out there with drunks possibly butting into our conversation. Besides, if I leave this room, its very well possible people will wander in and have sex in it.”\n\nJohnny chuckles a bit at your remark as he walks in.\n\n“Well I suppose all that’s true, but…”\n\nYou make your first move by putting your arms around Johnny’s shoulders and kissing Johnny squarely on the lips. He’s really surprised. To be quite honest, you’re a little surprised at yourself as well since you aren’t usually the forward type, but maybe Julie’s party spirit has gotten a hold of you a little bit along with wanting to put more distance between yourself and any more lingering feelings you might have for Bobby.\n\nBesides, you get the impression for all his praising and stalkerish behavior; Johnny would still be too shy to make the first move.\n\nJohnny’s reaction says that your instinct about that was entirely correct.\n\nHe pulls away fairly quickly after you’re finished, he blushes a bit and then gives you a weird stare.\n\n“What? I thought we were going to get to know each other.” You say.\n“I…I don’t think I’m ready for this.” Johnny remarks and starts backing away.\n“Wait, hold on. We weren’t going to have sex! We don’t even have to kiss anymore, I was just…”\n\nBefore you can even finish, Johnny’s already run out the door.\n\n“Great, Suzy. Some seductress you are. (Sigh)” you say to yourself and close your door.\n\nIn any case, you go back to your laptop to help shut yourself out from the real world again. which wouldn’t be that bad, but Johnny just flat out running away from you doesn’t exactly put you in that great of a mood. You got dumped by a murderer and now you’ve run off a stalker. What does that say about you?\n\nOh well at least things with batteries don’t judge.\n\nA couple hours later you get another knock on the door.\n\n“Yes?” you ask.\n“Suzy, it’s me Johnny. I need to talk.”\n\nYou’re not exactly sure if this is going to be a good idea, but you decide to at least hear him out.\n\n“(Sigh) Hold on.” You say and get up to open the door. Johnny stands before you wearing a jacket and looking slightly more disheveled from the last time.\n\n“Well? Are you coming in, I don’t feel like keeping the door open for all the partying assholes to peer into.” You ask.\n\nJohnny enters the room and you shut the door and walk back to your sofa.\n\n“Suzy, I just want to apologize. I’ve been thinking about this long and hard and I realize that I did the wrong thing.” Johnny says pacing back and forth, rubbing his hands through hair.\n“Well, maybe I did come on a little strong. I suppose if the roles had been reversed I would’ve run away as well.”\n“No, stop talking I need to get all this out. What I’m trying to say is that I obviously have wasted my time and that I shouldn’t have pursued you. I guess I just built you up in my head so much that I…dunno…I always do this…fuck! Shit! WHY!?!” Johnny says and hits himself in the head a couple times. He’s starting to worry you.\n\n“Hey Johnny, you don’t need to…”\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP WHORE!” Johnny screams and before you even can react he’s already run up and physically assaulted you. You try to scream out, but punches you your face and another tight grip around your throat prevent that from happening. The loud music from the party and indifference of the shallow partiers from any potential noise you could’ve made probably would’ve been lost to those two factors anyway.\n\nWhen you’re nearly unconscious and so dazed that you can no longer fight back, Johnny ceases his punches and reaches for something inside his jacket.\n\n“This is going to be quick, because even though you’re a whore like the rest…I still like you.” Johnny whispers. “I…really wish this could’ve worked out…you were so beautiful…”\n\nYour last feeling is the blade of a sharp knife slitting your throat.\n",
  "page 75": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the hum of a vacuum passing the outside your door. You shake your head, because you know who that probably is.\n\nYou check your phone for the time and see that you’ve slept through the morning as usual and nobody has called.\n\nAs you go through your bathroom routine of brushing your teeth and such, you ponder on whether or not you should check how trashed the house is or just stay in your room and not deal with it.\n\nUltimately you decide to check despite not really wanting to. Besides Johnny is obviously out there and you’re going to have to do something about him.\n\nYou exit your room and find that the hallway is fairly clean and the hum of the vacuum is now coming from the living room.\n\n“At it again are you Johnny?” you say walking into the living room. The living room is spotless and you notice that unlike the last time you don’t see anyone flopped out on the floor or sofa.\n\n“Hi Suzy, did you sleep well last night?” Johnny asks while turning off the vacuum.\n“Yeah. So did Julie ever come back?”\n“Nope, I never saw her again. Guess she might’ve stayed the night somewhere else.”\n“(Sigh) I see. Is there anyone else here?”\n“Nope, you’ll be pleased to know that I eventually managed to kick everyone out of the house, of course some just left anyway, but I figured you’d be glad to not have your home resemble a flophouse when you woke up.”\n“Wait, so are you telling me there’s nobody else here?”\n“Nope, except me of course.”\n\nThat makes you feel a little uneasy.\n\n“Uh…okay…” you say and start backing away a bit. You briefly wonder how fast you could run to the back door and escape and then you wonder if you could run into your room and grab that pistol that’s still in Julie’s dad’s desk.\n\nJohnny already senses your distress.\n\n“Shit. I’ve done it again. I’ve made you uncomfortable. I’m sorry Suzy, I just…I dunno. I don’t mean to be creepy, I just wanted to make things nice for you.” Johnny says and actually starts walking backwards from you in an effort to put you more at ease.\n\n“Johnny, I know you mean well and I know that you like me, but like I said, I’m just not ready for anyone right now.”\n“I know, I know, I know you said so before…but how can I win your heart if I don’t continue to try? Couldn’t we at least just talk more? I mean we really haven’t gotten to talk a lot one on one with just us around.” Johnny says.\n\n“Johnny…” you start to say, but then you’re interrupted from something loud outside.\n“What the hell…” Johnny says and walks over to one of the windows to peek.\n\n“Holy shit, there’s a bunch of military guys, a couple of military trucks and even an A.P.C. coming down the street!” Johnny remarks.\n\nAt first you can’t believe him, but that soon disappears when a loudspeaker is heard.\n\n“ATTENTION! THIS TOWN IS UNDER MARSHAL LAW AND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOW UNDER WATCH BY THE U.S. NATIONAL GUARD. A GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE WILL SOON VISIT ALL OF YOU AND ASSIST IN ANYTHING THAT YOU MAY NEED DURING THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY. STAY IN YOUR HOMES. DO NOT COME OUT FOR ANY REASON. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE.”\n\nWell that is certainly something you didn’t expect. You also don’t know what you’re going to do. Why is this town under marshal law? What the hell is going on?\n\nWhile you’re not sure of why this is happening, Johnny has some thoughts on the matter though.\n\n“Wow, I really hope this isn’t something serious, like some biological weapon or something…but then I’ve been watching the news while vacuuming and there’s been no emergency broadcast about such a thing or anything. Just those Ground Zero infomercials, which have been increasing as of late.”\n\nJohnny turns back to you.\n\n“Well anyway, I suppose one upside to all this. With us being stuck inside, we can talk and get to know each other better like I was suggesting before.” Johnny remarks.\n\nWhile Johnny has been just slightly on the side of creepy there actually is no proof that he isn’t just someone that lacks proper social skills and is a bit head over heels for you. And considering your last boyfriend was going around sacrificing people and could be very outwardly charming and charismatic, the way someone acts isn’t necessarily who they really are deep down inside.\n\nMaybe if you did get to know Johnny a bit better, you might feel different. Not ready to spread your legs different, but if you like what you hear he might actually make that step towards “winning your heart” as he put it. (Something about that phrase sounded so quaint that it actually was endearing)\n\n“Oh…all right. It’s not like I’ve got anything better to do at this point, but I’m warning you, don’t get the wrong impression. This isn’t a date or anything.” You say.\n“No, no, I got it. I just want a chance that’s all.”\n\nAfter you sit on the living room couch and motion that he sit in the chair you begin.\n“Okay then…well what should we talk about first? It isn’t like I’m usually that much of a conversationalist myself.” You say.\n“Well what do you like?” Johhny asks.\n\nA general question, but a perfectly reasonable one for getting straight to the point on wanting to know more about someone.\n\nThe funny thing is there isn’t much about you to know. Since you don’t get out much, you don’t DO much. The only time you did get out a little more was when you were with Bobby, and you can’t very well talk about shit you did with your ex.\n\nSo you mention hobbies such as watching movies, playing games, and reading shit on the Internet. (You leave out masturbation) Sounds like a pretty dull life to the average person, but Johnny doesn’t seem to care.\n\n“You don’t find what I said boring?” you ask.\n“Simple perhaps, but I wouldn’t say boring. Are you happy?”\n“Well I was happier when I could live in my basement and not have to deal with the rest of the world, and it would’ve been nicer to not have to put up with Kelly, but yeah I suppose I was happy just living like that.”\n“Then that’s all that matters. Me? I’ve been sort of drifting from place to place ever since I left home. To be honest it would be nice to have some place to call a permanent home, but something always happens and I end up having to move on again. As you might aspect I’ve had several lines of employment, I’m not rich but I suppose I at least know a little bit of everything to make a living.”\n“Sounds like you’ve had way more luck in that department at least. I’m flat broke and can’t even get a job. So why did you leave home in the first place?”\n“It was time. Really don’t want to go back either. Not fond of the memories… so hey did you hear from your sister? I mean did she call or leave a message or something?” Johnny asks, changing the topic.\n“Nope, and now with this marshal law thing going on, I’m a little concerned about her. Julie too. Who knows where the hell either of them are. I’m even wondering if I should call my brother Peter to see if things are all right with him, though I imagine he’s probably fine.”\n“You have a brother too? Wow, two sisters and a brother. You have a big family.”\n“I actually had an older brother Ben as well, but he died.”\n“Oh? Sorry to hear that. Should I ask how?”\n“He killed his family and then blew his brains out in our house.” You say.\n“Wait…what? Why?” Johnny says a bit off guard.\n“Well I wasn’t there for the final show, but he apparently thought the government was coming to get him and that it would be better if he killed his wife and son rather than they get captured and brainwashed. Something like that. He always was paranoid and just got worse as he got older.”\n“I see. And you say there was no truth to his stories about the government?”\n“Of course not.”\n“Are you sure? I mean just because you’re paranoid, doesn’t mean that they aren’t still trying to get you.”\n“Pretty sure if he was that much of a threat to the government they would’ve assassinated him long before he killed himself. And even if they were out to get him, there wasn’t any need for him to kill his wife and kid.”\n“Well I guess I can just see it from his point of view. He genuinely believed in his mind that the government was going to get him and seeing it as a losing battle and not wanting to lose those he loved to the enemy, his act of killing them was out of love. Kind of romantic really.”\n\nJohnny is so deadpan, you think he’s attempting some sort of dark humor, but you realize he’s being completely serious. Somehow you’re not really surprised.\n\n“…yeah well I’m just glad he didn’t love me then…” you remark.\n“I’m glad that’s the case too.” Johnny says with a smile.\n“So what about you? You said you had a mother and an older sister.” You ask.\n“Oh them. Eh, not much to tell I suppose. Like I said yesterday, your younger sister sounds very much like my older one, and your older sister sounds very much like my mother.”\n“You mother participated in illegal underground fight clubs and roller derby races?”\n“No. Wait, your sister really does all that?” Johnny asks.\n“Yeah, so what makes your mom so bad?”\n“Very domineering. Verbally abusive, sometimes physically. Emotionally too I guess.”\n“What about your father?”\n“Dunno, never knew him. Took off before I was born. My sister is only one year older than me, so she doesn’t remember him either. Just know that my mom hated his guts. Didn’t keep any pictures of him. What about yours?”\n“Eh, he was a travelling lightning rod salesman, so it was like he was never home. When mom died of the flesh-eating virus though he was practically home all the time and just gradually drank himself to death over the years. Still wasn’t really there for any of us.”\n\nJohnny nods and continues the conversation.\n\n“After hearing about your family…I’m starting to wonder if I really had it all that bad and perhaps I just think I did.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well like I said, my mother was very domineering, but I pretty much did what my mom said. I mean I hate to say I was a mama’s boy, but I didn’t really step out of line compared to my sister.”\n“Heh, sounds a little like me. Did pretty much what my mom told me too though she was the nicest one in my family. She probably was a little too sheltering of me though.”\n\nYou go on a bit more about your mother since you’re actually enjoying remembering the good times you did have with her. Johnny listens intently. Most of the time he looks like he’s displaying happiness because you’re mentioning positive memories, but sometimes you catch a glimpse of him looking away from you as if he’s in another place.\n\n“She sounds like a very nice person and I can see where you get your kind qualities from. Sorry to hear that she died in such an awful way…just yet another example of how you’ve overcome so much hardship in your life.”\n\nNow Johnny looks as if he’s completely gone to another place. He stares downward vacantly, if he was staring in your direction, you’d feel like he would be staring through you.\n\n“Johnny? Johnny? You with me?” you say.\n\nTakes him a few moments, but eventually he answers.\n\n“I’m not feeling…myself… I should go.”\n“What? Go? Where are you going to go? Are you sick?”\n\nOnce again Johnny doesn’t answer right away.\n\n“Yes.” He answers.\n\nThe monotone voice he answers with, isn’t exactly relaxing and you get the strong impression when he acknowledged that he’s sick, he didn’t mean physically.\n\nHe starts to get up, and he wobbles a bit. At first you think maybe he is physically sick, but then he also said he was tired. Considering he was cleaning up earlier, he probably never went home and stayed up all night again.\n\n“Johnny you can’t go out there, especially in your condition. The National Guard is out there, remember?”\n“I’m not worried about some weekend warriors, I can be stealthy when I want to be. I’m just glad you gave me a chance Suzy, but I fear I’ve wasted your time. I’m sorry.” Johnny says and then attempts to walk out the front door, but his balance isn’t the best.\n\nYou aren’t sure what’s going on with Johnny right now, but it’s even weirder than usual.\n",
  "page 74": "As charmingly strange as Johnny’s awkwardness is you’re still not quite ready to go jumping into a relationship with another guy.\n\n“That’s sweet Johnny. Really it is. It’s just… I’m not looking for another relationship right now. I just broke up with my boyfriend and I think I need to be by myself for a while.” You say.\n“Boyfriend? I see. I suppose a pretty girl like you would have a lot of them.” Johnny says. You notice his tone sort of becomes “flat” when he says this.\n“Pfft hardly. He was my first and only one.” You say.\n\nAnd as quickly as his demeanor changed before, it changes AGAIN just as quickly. Before you got the impression he was almost pissed upon hearing you even HAD a boyfriend despite the fact he was your ex. After your additional information, it’s almost like he’s perked up again.\n\n“Ah, okay…I understand. First love and lost. Been there before. Say no more, I’ll leave you be. It was a long shot anyway.”\n\nJust as Johnny is about to leave, you sort of feel like you should say something helpful.\n\n“Johnny?”\n“Yes, Suzy?”\n“You’re a good guy Johnny, and I’m sure there’s some girl out there for you.”\n“I know, but she probably killed herself when she found out I was the guy for her.” Johnny says with a small chuckle.\n\n“Anyway, thank you for being upfront and trying to be encouraging. I must say though, whoever your ex was, he must’ve been an idiot to let you get away.”\n\nYou watch as Johnny disappears into the crowd and you shut your door.\n\nHaving dealt with your momentary break up of your usual routine, you briefly check your phone for the time and to see if maybe your sister tried to call (You still think she probably got hauled in by the cops) but nobody has called.\n\nHaving little else to do, you go back to what you were doing before.\n\nHours pass and you start to get hungry which unfortunately means you’re going to have to brave going out there and raiding the kitchen assuming there’s even anything in there.\n\nYou exit your room and find that the party is still as lively as ever. Nobody pays too much attention to you as you creep through the crowd.\n\nThe kitchen is a complete wreck. You don’t exactly know what went on in here, but there is some guy lying face down on a broken kitchen table. His head is bleeding and there are several broken beer bottles all over the floor. You almost hesitate to step inside the room, though there are a couple of other people just standing around in the kitchen drinking as if nothing was wrong.\n\n“Jesus Christ.” You say. “Does that guy need an ambulance?” you ask.\n\nEventually one of the people in the kitchen realizes you were asking them.\n\n“Hrm? Oh him? Yeah he’s fine. Just got drunk, got into a fight and then well as you can see he wasn’t the winner. He does this all the time.” A girl says in a bored tone.\n“Yeah well I’d appreciate it, if he and whoever else was involved hadn’t wrecked the goddamn kitchen in the process!”\n“What’s the big deal and what concern is it of yours? It’s Julie’s kitchen and she won’t care.”\n“I happen to live here so it actually is somewhat of my concern, and where is Julie anyway?”\n“I dunno. Probably getting fucked as usual. Still don’t know why you’re worried about it. Besides some weird guy said he was getting something to clean up the mess anyway.” The girl says and goes back to talking with the guy she was previously talking to.\n\n“Weird guy?” you say to yourself.\n“Hey, Suzy.”\n\nYou turn around and see Johnny behind you with a broom, a dustpan and some sort of cleaning product.\n\n“Johnny, what are you still doing…wait, have you been lingering all night around hoping that I might come out of my room?”\n\nJohnny looks away a bit as if you hit the nail on the head.\n\n“Well…actually at first I was kind of hoping that maybe you’d change your mind and come running out of your room to find me. A silly storybook fantasy really…but then after about an hour of indulging in that delusion I realized I needed to accept reality. I was going to leave, but then I suddenly got offered a video game controller from a guy that stopped playing, so I started playing. I ended up getting sort of wrapped up in the game, shooting people in the face, murdering hookers and such. Sort of fun, and made me feel better.”\n\nJohnny passes you by and starts sweeping up broken glass and continues talking.\n\n“After my escapism with virtual violence then I decided to go home, but then I heard about a fight going on in the kitchen so I decided to be a spectator, but by the time I got here, it was already over and the winner went out the back door. I didn’t think it was right to just leave your kitchen like this even if nobody else cared, so I tried to find your friend Julie because I didn’t want to bother you again since you made your feelings quite clear to me and I didn’t want to look like a stalker.”\n“A little late for that, Johnny.” You say.\n“Heh, well anyway I couldn’t find her. I asked around and someone said she left wit ha couple guys. So not knowing what else to do, I just decided to clean up the mess myself before I left.”\n\n“Wait a minute, are you telling me Julie isn’t here for her own fucking party?”\n“Uh, no it appears she isn’t.”\n\nIt’s one thing to have to put up with the parties when she’s actually here, but if she’s not even going to be here then why the hell do you have to still put up with it? So much for Julie’s sob story about going to turn over a new leaf after your talk. You’re annoyed and to top it off you’re still really hungry.\n\n“Goddamnit all I wanted to do is get some food from the fucking kitchen…” you say.\n“Did you want me to order a pizza for you?”\n“I don’t have any money.”\n“So? I got some money, I’ll be happy to buy you a pizza, I’ll get you a drink too.”\n\nActually you don’t have anything against Johnny’s offer, but you’re hesitant to accept.\n\n“Johnny, I’ll accept your offer, BUT I don’t want YOU to get it in your head that I owe you something because of it.”\n“Thought never crossed my mind.” Johnny says. He doesn’t even seem hurt by your implication.\n“Okay. Sorry, I got a little authoritative there.”\n“No, no, I get it. It’s smart for you to lay that out there immediately. Anyway I’ll call up the place and I’ll get it to you when it’s here. In the meantime you can go back and relax in your room if you wish.” Johnny says continuing to sweep.\n\n“Oh. Um okay. Thanks. Hey, do you think we should call an ambulance for that guy on the floor?” you ask Johnny.\n“Him? Nah, he’s fine. I actually checked him soon after I came in here. Really I would’ve rolled him over on his back, but with all the broken glass on the floor I probably would’ve done more harm. Anyway I got this, don’t worry.” Johnny says.\n\nWell he might be a weird guy who seems creepy at times and is definitely stalking you a bit, but at least he’s helpful which is more that can be said for Julie who has seemingly just abandoned her own party. You try to call her up, but you get no answer, but you weren’t really expecting one anyway.\n\nStill it is weird that she left. Julie’s always been irresponsible, but she’s like you in that she barely ever leaves the house. After all, why would she go get fucked, drunk and high elsewhere when she can do it right here?\n\nIn any case, she’ll probably be back, and you go back to wasting your time on the Internet. After a half hour passes and there’s a knock on the door.\n\n“Pizza delivery.” Johnny says.\n“Okay.” You answer and get up to open the door.\n“Here you go. I ordered a standard pepperoni and cheese pizza and got you Coke. Hope that’s okay, since I forgot to ask what you like.”\n“It’s fine. Thank you.”\n“Alright then, I’ll leave you be.” Johnny says starting to leave.\n\nYou don’t know what it is about this guy but…\n\n“Hey Johnny, did you want some pizza?”\n“Huh? Oh, nah. I’m good. I ate a little earlier. I don’t tend to eat much anyway.”\n“Hm, don’t eat much, don’t sleep much. You sure you’re human?” you half joke.\n\nThis causes an unusual guffaw of laughter that you didn’t expect from him.\n\n“I sometimes wonder that myself.” He says still chuckling. “Enjoy the rest of your evening Suzy.”\n\nJohnny once again disappears into the crowd in the living room and you lock your door.\n\nThe rest of your night is pretty much eating your pizza, drinking your coke, taking a quick shower and then eventually settling in for the night. You have no idea if the part is still going on outside, but the noise has decreased a little, so maybe it’s starting to wind down.\n\nWell at least you don’t need to share your bed this time.\n",
  "page 130": "You might as well continue to Julie’s house. Going back home is just prolonging the inevitable. Also if your sister shows up at Julie’s, you’d like to give her a piece of your mind about her just ditching you like that.\n\nYour walk to Julie’s slowly starts to become a worrisome endeavor. You see several fights along with a number of other officers arresting folks. You also see a couple of bad car accidents. While you try to avoid large groups of people, you’re still in the danger zone of what almost seems like chaos on the streets. Those two asshole cops weren’t joking when one of them said it seemed like the entire town had lost its mind.\n\nAs you quicken your pace to Julie’s in an attempt to get through this madness quicker, a large teenager that’s running from something runs right into you while he’s turning a corner. The pair of you fall on the sidewalk.\n\nYou’re a little dazed, but before you can even recover the teenager is upon you.\n\n“You stupid fucking bitch! Gimme yo’ shit!” he shouts and punches you in the face and then proceeds to attempt to rip your backpack from you, though he’s having a hard time seeing as it’s firmly strapped to your back.\n\nThe teenager gets frustrated and stops trying to rob you and then just seems to be focused on abusing you. You feel several kicks going into your side and then your face. You plead for him to stop and curl up into a ball, but he’s not even listening, it’s like he’s possessed or something because he actually starts laughing.\n\n“There’s that motherfucker!” A voice shouts. You don’t see who it is due to you being curled up and having your eyes closed wishing you were elsewhere, but you soon feel the weight of several someones stepping and falling all over you. The pursuers of your assailant have caught up to him and you are now unfortunately being crushed in the resulting dogpile.\n\nYou desperately attempt to crawl away feeling the pain of several fists, elbows, knees and feet randomly hitting you in the process. You just want to be home.\n\nYou manage to crawl out from under the pile and then scramble away as fast as you can only to stumble on your bruised wobbly legs in the middle of the street. It is then where your luck only gets worse when a speeding truck slams into your body which goes flying a few feet in front of the truck only THEN to be run completely over by the same truck which doesn’t stop at all.\n\nYour misery is put to an end under the heavy weight of the truck’s tires causing the innards from your mangled body to squeeze out like a tube of toothpaste and painting the street red.\n",
  "page 251": "Antagonizing them even further isn’t going to help; at this point you’re better off trying to beg.\n\n“Jed, please. I’d just like you both to leave. Lilith really doesn’t want anyone here and I don’t want anyone to get into trouble.” You say.\n\n“Oh don’t worry blondie, ain’t nobody gonna get into any trouble and ain’t nobody gonna get hurt as long as you give in. Hey Hugo get yer big ass in here and, close that fucking door.” Jed says and starts approaching you.\n\nThis is not a good situation. There is no way you’re going to be able to fight off both of these redneck rapists. You don’t even have a weapon and they’re both bigger than you. You fear the inevitable as Jed is now standing in front of you.\n\nHe wastes no time in groping your body. Hugo however is still standing in front of the door staring like a gargoyle.\n\n“Aww, is little blondie scared? You don’t need to be darlin’. Like I said, me an’ Hugo here are just gonna have us some fun an’ then we’ll be out of yer pretty little hair, well unless I cum in it.” Jed laughs.\n“Please don’t…” you start to say before Jed firmly grabs your chin with one of his dirty hands.\n“No. None of that blondie. The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she’s giving head. An’ since you seem to like having it open, you can get to doing just that.” Jed says and then roughly shoves you to your knees.\n\nYou don’t even look up, you just stare at Jed’s crotch as he starts undoing his zipper because you don’t even want to look at his fucking leering rape face.\n\nJed pulls out his cock and slaps you in the face with it.\n\n“Alright, bitch get to suckin! Do a good job cause this is just the beginning and I’m sure you’re lookin’ forward to what I got in store for that pretty little tight ass of yours!”\n\nYou have no choice. This is happening and you’ve gone beyond feeling scared and you’re now feeling completely and utterly helpless.\n\nYou get started…\n\nYour mind starts to go to another place. Or at least it tries to; the problem is Jed is so fucking repulsive in every way possible; you can’t even at least begin to pretend he’s Bobby or someone else. ANYONE else.\n\nJed is pushing your head and making all sorts of grunting noises and vulgar comments in general. It’s without a doubt the worst feeling in the world and there really are no words to describe how horrible this is.\n\nAnd it’s only going to get worse given the implications that Jed is going to rape you anally.\n\nWhile you’re dwelling on this miserable situation, something in your mind begins to change. The fear is starting to dissipate and you’re starting to get angry and you start to feel less helpless…\n\nHis dick is in YOUR mouth. You’ve got ALL the fucking power here.\n\nThis might be suicide, but you can’t just let these assholes violate you anymore than they already have without a fight. You HAVE to do SOMETHING.\n\n“Holy fucking shit, Hugo! Blondie here is fucking an amazing cocksucker! I think she’s deep throated the whole…ARGH!”\n\nYou bite. You bite as hard as you can. Even with Jed punching at your head, you don’t stop biting. You bring a whole new meaning to the phrase lockjaw.\n\nJed by this point is screaming on the floor for his brother to help him. Hugo attempts to pull you off, but all he’s succeeding in doing is contributing to ripping his brother’s dick off due to your firm bite on the now bloody member.\n\nYou keep grinding and gnashing and the fight is now going completely out of Jed who is now just howling in pain and screaming like a little girl. And at last you manage to bite through, blood fills your mouth and as Hugo pulls you away, you spit Jed’s dick back at him.\n\n“I’m the blowjob queen bitch!” you shout and start laughing as blood drips from all over your mouth and face.\n\nIn between his screaming and holding where his dick once was, he orders Hugo to kill you. Hugo doesn’t waste anytime in squeezing you tightly. You begin to have hard time breathing. Using the back your head you slam into his face several times and while you probably break his nose in the process, Hugo continues with his bear hug and you start to lose consciousness.\n\n“(sob)Don’t fucking knock her out, I said fucking kill that goddamn biting bitch! OWWW OHHH (sob) Break her goddamn neck!” Jed screams.\n\nSuddenly the door opens up and you see an older man in a bloody lab coat. His hair is completely white and wild looking. This must be Leslie.\n\n“What the fuck are you two inbreds doing in here making all this fucking noise?! OH FUCK! You fucktards have really done it! I can’t rely on you two for shit! Hugo drop that fucking bitch now!” Leslie says and pulls a pistol out of his coat pocket.\n“…(sob) she bit my fuckin’ dick off Doc! She’s gotta die! OWWWWW OHHHH (Sob)” Jed screams.\n“Yeah, well maybe she will, but this here’s my sister’s patient and you two just fucked with her results. Y’know what, fuck this I’m tired of reasoning with you two.” The Leslie says and points the pistol at Jed.\n\n“Now Hugo, you overgrown retard, you kill blondie there, your brother fucking eats a bullet. I can sew your brother’s dick back on, but you gotta let that bitch go cause she’s my sister’s patient, not mine. Now what’s it gonna be?”\n\nHugo just looks on confused while still squeezing the life out of you.\n\n“FUCKING JUST DROP THE BITCH HUGO! I NEED MY DICK!” Jed cries.\n\nHugo finally understanding the situation drops you in a heap. You remain on the floor just coughing up dick blood and still trying to catch your breath.\n\n“Thank you. Now was that so hard?” Leslie says and then calmly shoots Hugo in the head three times. The big man fortunately falls backwards rather than forward on to you.\n\n“NOOOOO!” Jed screams. “What the fuck Doc?! You (Sob) killed my fucking brother! Why?!”\n“Told you, I was done reasoning with you two assholes. You have proven time and time again to be non-learning animals. Besides, Lilith’s already gonna bitch at me for what you two fucktards did. Might as well do damage control now.”\n“But you said you’d sew my dick back on if that bitch lived!”\n“I’m not touching your fucking diseased dick.” Leslie laughs.\n“Fuck you Doc! FUCK…”\n\nLeslie calmly places three rounds in Jed’s head, putting the redneck out of his misery.\n\nYou just look on in complete shock at what just happened and try stand up. Leslie however kicks you back to the floor. You want to fight, but you’re too weak at this point. Leslie pulls out a syringe and holds you down while stabbing you in the arm with it. Must be the same stuff his sister injected you with yesterday, because it works nearly immediately.\n\n“No, I don’t think so blondie. Think you’ve had enough action for one day.” Leslie says as he strokes your hair.\n\n“Oh the fun I would have with you, but I guess what ultimately happens to you will be my sister’s call. Who knows, maybe you’ll get lucky….SHIT!” Leslie suddenly exclaims when he sees that you’re not falling unconscious, but rather going into violent convulsions.\n\nLeslie begins to look through his other coat pocket and pulls out another syringe cursing when he sees it. Meanwhile you’re spitting and coughing up blood. It feels like you can’t breathe and that’s mainly because you can’t.\n\n“FUCK! I used the wrong syringe on the bitch! Fuck! Sis is gonna be even more pissed! Shit! Fuck!” Leslies exclaims pacing back and forth.\n\nWhatever Leslie’s concerns are about getting yelled at by his sister are nothing compared to the agony you’re going through right now. Your insides feel like they’re on fire and every major organ in your body is shutting down.\n\nBy the time Lilith gets back to your room, your poisoned bloody corpse, the bodies of two dead rednecks and Leslie’s poor attempt to spin the event so it doesn’t seem like it was his fault are all that remain.\n",
  "page 250": "You focus your mind and try to muster up all your courage for what you’re about to say next. It might very well be suicidal, but if the unthinkable is going to happen, then at least you can take comfort that you stood up to them even as scared as you are right now.\n\n“Look, you fucking inbred rednecks, get the fuck out before you get in some major shit so deep that you ain’t got the hip waiters for it!” you exclaim.\n\nJed is hardly intimidated and his expression changes from perverted leer to burning hatred.\n\n“Hugo get out of that entryway and close that fucking door. I think this little blonde bitch needs to learn I don’t take orders from whores. Let alone one that isn’t sucking my cock, but I think we can change that situation.” Jed says.\n\n“You think that’s supposed to fucking scare me?” you say and then Jed grabs you by both arms squeezing tightly. He presses his body against yours and looks down at you menacingly.\n\n“Oh I can tell you’re scared bitch, I’ve been doing this a long time. And even if you weren’t, you better damn well be. Last time I saw Doc’s sister she was outside speaking with some soldier boys. She ain’t gonna be down here in time to save your ass and if you think that we’ll get in trouble for fucking you up, you over estimate your worth. At the most, we’ll get chewed out by Doc, for pissing off his sister by wreckin’ her kitty licking fuck buddy.” Jed says.\n\nYou just look down after Jed’s response. Still holding your arms tightly he addresses you again.\n\n“What? Got nuthin’ else to say? Yeah that’s what I fucking thought. You fucking whores talk tough when you think you got a savior, but when the shit goes down, you shut the fuck up real quick.”\n\nYou start laughing and look up at Jed’s face, which is now showing a bit of confusion due to your response.\n\n“You truly are one dumb ass fucktard, Jed. You keep thinking I’m Lilith’s whore, or whatever fantasy YOU put in your own goddamn pathetic little head of yours. If I was her whore, don’t you think I’d be dressed more like one? Look at how the fuck I’m dressed! I’m in a fucking HOSPITAL GOWN! Who wears hospital gowns? FUCKING PATIENTS! I’m her patient! I’M FUCKING SICK AND CONTAGIOUS YOU STUPID ASSHOLE!” you shout with a mixture of contempt and amusement.\n\nAt this point Jed takes his hands off of you and backs off a bit.\n\n“Shit!” he shouts.\n“Oh what? Am I not so attractive now that you’ve found out I might have shit that will make your dick fall off? Come on stud, I’ll make it totally worth it! I guarantee it’ll be the last fuck you’ll ever need.” You say and start grabbing at him and laughing.\n\nJed gives you a hard shove causing you to fall backwards.\n\n“Fuck! Hugo, this bitch has got the crotch rot somethin’ fierce! Open up that fucking door!” Jed shouts.\n\nHugo comprehends the situation just well enough to follow Jed’s orders and it doesn’t take long before they’re both out the door. Unfortunately Jed isn’t quite so stupid to leave the door open or unlocked since you hear a firm click. Of course maybe he was just so scared of you possibly getting out that he took the time to lock it. In any case you got rid of them and you’re alone again.\n\nYou’re quite pleased that this is the first time you actually employed an assertive method this week and it worked out. Your arms hurt from Jed squeezing them though.\n\nA half hour later, you hear the door again. This time it’s Lilith and she looks somewhat harried when she comes in. She’s also carrying a tray of food with what looks to be meat on it and some potatoes on it. She places it on coffee table in front of the sofa and also gives you a bottle of water. She then sits down on the chair Jed was sitting in.\n\n“Whew. Sorry about that. Just one thing after another. Anyway, there’s your food. It’s left over meatloaf from yesterday that I heated up. Hope that’s okay. We still had quite a bit left and I didn’t really have time to prepare anything else. Leslie usually does most of the cooking around here anyway.”\n\nYou stare at the meatloaf, which doesn’t look all that appetizing. The potatoes look okay though. You notice your eating utensils are plastic. Guess Lilith isn’t completely trusting of you either.\n\n“What’s wrong? You’re not a vegetarian are you?” Lilith asks.\n“Um, no. Not at all.” You say and poke at the meatloaf.\n“You think I poisoned the food?”\n“Actually I didn’t think that, until you just mentioned it. I was just thinking of how unappealing the meat looks.” You say.\n“Well not that this might help calm your fears, but I didn’t poison or drug the food. There wouldn’t be much point in it; you’re my control subject after all. As for the look of the meat, well my brother’s a good cook, but he’s never been big on presentation, but I assure you it tastes much better than it looks. Of course you don’t need to eat it. There are potatoes there.”\n“No, I’ll eat. I’m hungry enough and I don’t have that much choice.” You say.\n\nYou take a bite of the meatloaf and it’s actually just like Lilith said, it looks awful, but it does taste good.\n\n“You were right.” You say.\n“Well I do understand the hesitation. I remember some of the meals my brother has made in the past and they looked more like something that already was digested. He’s gotten a bit better with it though. Anyway, so how have you been feeling? Still no sudden mood swings or violent urges or anything I trust?” Lilith asks.\n“Well no, but I did have to act crazy to get two redneck assholes out of here.”\n“Oh no. (Sigh) Jed and Hugo came in here? I told my brother not to let those assholes wander around down here picking the locks to places they’re not supposed to be going anyway!”\n“Apparently they were under the impression I was your personal whore.”\n“What?! Why the hell would they think…nevermind…they didn’t do anything to you did they?”\n“No, like I said, I acted crazy. Or more specifically I convinced them I was sick and contagious. They left real quick after that.”\n“Heh, good thinking. Explains why I saw their shitty pick up truck screech out of here earlier.”\n“Hope to never see them again.” You say continuing to eat.\n“Yeah well that will be arranged. I’ll tell my people stationed outside to shoot them on sight if they return. I don’t care if Leslie complains about it either. Besides, there’s news that we all might not be staying here much longer.”\n\nYou stop eating for a moment.\n\n“What do you mean?” you ask.\n“Well as I said, the National Guard are currently stationed in town and trying to maintain order. While they might succeed, GZ doesn’t fancy their chances and would rather not lose a valuable employee such as myself in the possible chaos that will spill over. So they’re ready to ship me and my brother out of here to a GZ shelter, a proper company one, not the ones that have been built for the common public. It’s just as well considering the reports we’ve been getting on the world situation.” Lilith says.\n\nYou take a drink of water wondering what this means for you.\n\n“When is this going to happen?” you ask.\n“Maybe tomorrow, definitely by Friday. I’m going to miss this house, so many good memories here especially with Leslie. I can only imagine the talk I’m going to have to have with him. Looks like he’s going to have company job whether he wants one or not. Oh well, he’ll get used to it…”\n“What about me?” you interrupt.\n“Well, that is the question isn’t it?” Lilith says, taking off her glasses and rubbing her eyes.\n\n“While I haven’t been able to do the tests and ask the questions like I wanted to earlier today, I’m fairly certain you’re fine and you’re one of those few that aren’t affected by the side affects of the drug. I have a few theories on why that might be, but nothing solid. It doesn’t really matter anyway I suppose at this late stage.” Lilith remarks.\n“So…I’m free to go?” you ask.\n“Well, I do want to keep you for observation for one more day. I mean might as well since we might not be leaving tomorrow anyway. After that, well I suppose it’s up to you. If you want to leave, you will be allowed to leave. You probably should keep in mind however, that returning to town might not be the best idea, so I’m not sure where you’d go. Do you have anywhere to go?”\n“Not really. I mean I don’t have my phone so I can’t even call anyone who might give a shit. Not that my family would give a shit of course, so I don’t really even have a home at this point.”\n“Hm, well that leads me to the other possible option, that I can probably take you with us. Might take some string pulling and calling in of favors, but if you want to come with us, you can.”\n“Go with you? To a GZ Shelter? What would I do there?”\n“Oh I’m sure we could find something, no need to worry about that. You’d have to follow the rules there though. Life would be quite different, but with the way things are going, I’m sure life is going to be different anyway.”\n\nYou just nod silently as Lilith stands up to head back to the door.\n\n“Tell you what. Let’s dispense with any more interrogation today. You already had to deal with waking up strapped to a gurney, not knowing where you were, being told that the world may end soon and that you may or may not suffer a negative side affect of a drug, not to mention those redneck rapists barging in here. I think you deserve to relax for the rest of the day and night.”\n“So, that’s it?”\n“For today it is. Like I said, just make yourself at home for now. This will all be over soon and you won’t be a prisoner here. I’m glad you’ve been making this easy Suzy. That’s definitely a good thing.” Lilith says and leaves.\n\nAlone once again and now you’ve got the whole night to contemplate your situation, which has changed again.\n\nEscape is now looking unnecessary given that Lilith seems to not have any insidious plans of going back on here word. You’re not even sure it would be a good idea to do so anyway now considering she mentioned GZ security are now guarding the perimeter of the house.\n\nOf course that still leaves the question of “where will you go?” While she’s already warned you about town, you really don’t have anywhere else. You don’t even have a vehicle. You suppose you could always just risk heading back home or maybe even Julie’s assuming either place is still standing.\n\nThe offer to go with Lilith and her brother is just odd though. It really is an unknown factor, but if things are really getting as bad as Lilith claims, maybe you need to embrace the unknown.\n\nYou spend the rest of the night pondering your options until you eventually get sleepy and drift off on the couch.\n",
  "page 132": "Really after the day you’ve had so far, all you want to do is go home and hide out in your basement, so back home it is.\n\nYour walk home isn’t entirely uneventful. You see several fights along with a number of other officers arresting folks. You also see a couple of bad car accidents. While you try to avoid large groups of people, you still are paranoid about someone to try to rob you or accost you in some way, but fortunately you manage to keep your head down and look as unassuming as possible.\n\nIt isn’t quite chaos on the streets, but those two asshole cops weren’t joking when one of them said it seemed like the entire town had lost its mind.\n\nBy the time you get back to your own neighborhood, it’s starting to get dark, though your area is actually rather quiet compared to most places you passed through. You just hope Kelly isn’t home because you don’t really feel like dealing with her right now.\n\nWhen you get home, you see Peter’s car in the driveway. Kelly’s vehicle isn’t here though, so it looks like you won’t have to put up with her and that’s at least one good thing that’s happened to you today. (Besides the not getting raped part)\n\nUpon entering the house, it’s in same condition as it was when you left, though now you’re hearing a lot of grunting and sounds of ecstasy coming from the garage connected to the house. You imagine Peter is in the process of filming one of his shows again.\n\nNot wishing to hear your brother squeal like a pig as he gets fucked for the pleasure of his viewing Internet public, you waste no time in heading down into the basement and settling back into your usual routine in your room.\n\nYou know this isn’t going to be permanent, but for now at least you can not worry about the pandemonium that’s going on outside. You just wish the TV wasn’t playing so many Ground Zero infomercials.\n\nHours pass as they do and just as you’re getting ready to fall asleep, you suddenly get a phone call. It’s Donna. You almost don’t even bother answering, but you’re curious to see if she’s calling from jail and if she’s delusional enough to think you’ll actually bail her out.\n\n“Hey sis, where you at?!” Donna asks. Sounds like music in the background so she must not be in jail.\n“I’m at home, no thanks to you just ditching me like that!” you say.\n“You said you were going to run, like I was! Didn’t you do it?”\n“No, because by the time you took off without at least giving me a signal, one of those assholes was ready to shoot me. So I had to suffer through getting threatened, thrown in the back of a police car and groped a lot more severely than the first time they patted us down.”\n“Oh geez…they didn’t...um…”\n“No, they didn’t do that. Though I suspect if that had happened I wouldn’t even be alive to talk to you right now. Your car didn’t have any drugs in it by the way, but they have impounded it and I’m pretty sure they still have you on a watchlist or something for evading arrest.”\n“Shit. Figured something like that might happen.”\n“Hm, Yeah and I’m an idiot for nearly going along with your plan, but hey I guess everything went okay for you, I hear the party music in the back so I’m guessing you’re whoring it up with Julie so I’ll let you go so you can have your fun.”\n“Hold on Suzy. First of all I’m not at Julie’s. I’m at Kitty City like I said I would be. Second, I can’t even get a hold of Julie. She’s not answering her phone. Now of course she could just be busy, but if I got some sort of warrant out on me, then maybe going back there isn’t the best idea right now. I’m thinking maybe I should stay with my friend Tina instead. She’s a stripper that’s entertained at some of Julie’s parties in the past. She’s got room since she kicked her boyfriend out of her trailer.”\n“Uh huh, well that’s great for you. Glad to see you’ve once again landed on your feet despite evading arrest. Goodbye.”\n“Suzy, wai…”\n\nYou hang up. You half expect Donna to call again, but she doesn’t which you’re glad because you’ve run out of patience with her for the day.\n\nYou settle down for the night and get some sleep, trying to put this horrible day behind you.\n",
  "page 253": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou wake up once again a prisoner, though perhaps not for long and despite everything, you’re actually feeling slightly optimistic about your situation. Very slightly.\n\nYou aren’t sure what time it is, but knowing your usual sleeping habits, it’s probably at least the afternoon. You imagine you’ll be getting a visit from Lilith as usual soon so you start perusing the nearby books until she comes in. You pick one that looks interesting to you.\n\nAs you’re reading “Unusual Sexual Practices From Around the World” you start hearing the faint noise of what sounds like yelling or shouting. Doesn’t really sound like any actual words though, more like just noises, still the sound isn’t completely distinct.\n\nA few minutes later you hear something that sounds like a gunshot. You start to worry and keeping you ears open, but you don’t hear anything else unusual until you hear that familiar sound of the door opening up. Fortunately it’s Lilith and not someone who isn’t supposed to be in here. Once again she looks a bit beleaguered as she carries in what looks to be a small medical bag and a notebook.\n\n“Um, is everything okay? I thought I heard shouting and a shot.” You say.\n“Yeah, I imagine you would have given your proximity. You remember I said you were my control subject? Well some of the others down here aren’t and they’ve been getting worse. My brother just put one down that was starting to break his restraints. I have a feeling the rest are going to have to be put down as well, because I don’t think I’m going to bother having them transported with us when we leave, which is looking like today since shit is reportedly getting even worse in town.\n\nThe “putting down” of subjects is a little concerning until Lilith immediately follows up her statement.\n\n“Relax, you’re not getting shot unless you start regressing into a savage and let me guess, you’ve experienced no problems correct?”\n“Nope. Feel fine. Just a little anxiousness, especially being near people that might be turning into beasts.” You remark.\n“Don’t worry about that. They might escape the restraints, but they aren’t escaping out the rooms. We made sure of that when we had this area built it had solid doors and walls. Anyway, since things are moving rather quickly now I suppose I’ll just wrap up your little part in this observation which isn’t going to take long.”\n\nLilith at this point pulls out a syringe and a tourniquet along with some cotton balls and rubbing alcohol.\n\n“Now I’m just going to draw some blood, not inject you with anything.”\n“What do you need my blood for?”\n“Oh just need another sample for testing. I mean I already drew blood from you when you were unconscious a day ago, so this is just a follow up really. Considering you’re not frothing at the mouth or destroying this room by now, I’m very certain you weren’t affected by whatever exposure of the drug you might have in contact with, but never hurts to be thorough. Your arm please.”\n\nLilith has more or less been playing square with you so reluctantly you hold out your arm and after prepping it she begins to draw blood.\n\n“Ugh, hate needles.” You say looking away.\n“Most people do. Leslie used to hate them too. Still does actually. Really odd considering he’s a doctor and uses them on a regular basis…then again I suppose it’s different when you’re using them on other people. There we go.”\n\nLilith finishes up and you’re rubbing your arm watching a tube of your blood go into another container and then placed back into the bag. Lilith then starts flipping through pages of her notebook.\n\n“So, I guess I’ll be free to leave soon?” you ask.\n“Yes. I’ll have the clothes you were wearing brought to you soon. I’m sure you’re sick of wearing the gown. After that well, I guess you can make your decision on whether to go or come with us. I contacted a few high ups at the offices and they said it was fine if I brought you.” She answers without looking up.\n“Oh. Well I guess that does open up options for me then.” You say still unsure of what you’re going to do.\n\nYou have been meaning to ask Lilith about something she said to you yesterday though.\n\n“Hey, I was sort of wondering…what did you mean yesterday about me not being a beacon of sanity?” you ask.\n“Funny you should ask, since I was just about to do a last minute interview with you, so I had at least a few more things to put down in my report. Most of what I’ve got on you is only through observation or what Bobby told me. It would be nice if I had something directly from you. Of course as I keep complaining about, things haven’t been ideal lately.”\n\nLilith finds the page she was looking for and then focuses complete attention on you.\n\n“To answer your question…keep in mind this is based on all observation and mostly Bobby’s words so I’ll admit this isn’t necessarily an accurate assessment of your personality. No offense is meant, but here’s my impression of you and why and please feel free to interject whenever you want.”\n\nLilith goes into a psychological assessment of your character and while you do fill in on some of what she might be missing and clarify on other aspects of your life, she doesn’t really lose a beat in her view of you, indeed it only seems to enhance it.\n\nShe starts off by talking about your introverted behavior to the point of falling into escapist behavior. She discusses that some of this is due to being the product of a dysfunctional family where you were only ever close to your mother since she was the only one that ever displayed any positive attention and when she died that was one of the major turning points of you shutting yourself off from the world and “giving up” in general. However Lilith mentions that this relationship wasn’t exactly the healthiest since it placed pressure on being “good and proper” which apparently had some negative effects on not just you, but your other sisters as well.\n\nThen she mentions that while you finally broke out of this shell a bit when you met Bobby, that relationship wasn’t exactly built on a stable foundation to begin with and indeed just fed into your world of fantasy on some level, with Bobby being a “Prince” whisking you away from the clutches of a “villain” (Your uncle in this case). Most of your relationship was co-dependency and enabling behavior since who would anyone that considered themselves “normal” stay with a man who doesn’t just murder people, but essentially runs a cult?\n\nShe then goes on to say that while she does think you did care for Bobby on some level, she doesn’t believe that you were really capable of ever loving him and not because of his sister, but because deep down you’re not really capable of the emotion at all. She mentions that you’re so used to your own company and withdrawn that you can’t even form proper attachments. Even a “non-normal” one like you had with Bobby.\n\nShe finishes up by saying that while much of your personality can be explained by “nurture”, there is evidence that all of the behaviors you exhibit were all just laying in wait to flourish anyway. Other members of your family have their own personality problems (Sadism, suicidal depression, narcissism, nymphomania, paranoid delusions, psychopathy, etc) meaning that it’s probably all genetic on some level. She even believes that under certain circumstances you could not only be capable of great violence, but also revel in it.\n\n“But what does all this mean?” you ask.\n“Nothing much as far as my report goes except maybe a half assed theory on why the drug didn’t seem to have an affect on your mind. I suppose for you it’s greater insight on yourself, but I’d wager that given your introspective nature, you’ve probably already pondered all of what I’ve just told at one time or another. It’s probably why you’re not really insulted by my words, because you probably agree with everything I said on some level.”\n\nYou don’t really have a response because what Lilith says is somewhat true. It’s actually pretty damn scary how accurate she was given that all her information was mainly based on Bobby’s words and the few conversations she’s had with you.\n\n“Wow. Well I guess you didn’t go the typical route and say I was a closet lesbian or something.” You say.\n“Oh, no. I don’t believe you’re a closeted lesbian.” Lilith chuckles.\n\n“You just have some repressed bisexual tendencies, but that’s really a very minor point in the scheme of things. Anyway, I think we’re done. I’ll go grab your clothes and…”\n\nSuddenly the door opens up and you see an older man with wild hair that’s completely white in color. He wears a bloody lab coat and has a pistol in one hand. You wonder if this Leslie.\n\n“Sis, you need to get your ass out here. We’re under damn attack and we could use another pair of hands to hold a weapon out here.” He says.\n“Who the hell is attacking?” Lilith says.\n“Who do you think? Damn crazies from town and your GZ boys aren’t exactly the crack team they think they are. Just saw one of those fucking cowards run off…well before he got tackled and eaten by a bunch of those crazy fuckers.”\n“Shit, they probably sent a bunch of fucking rookies. (Sigh) Fine, let’s go Leslie. Suzy, you might want to stay here.”\n\nLilith gets up to go with her brother, and the pair of them leaves the room. You don’t hear a click this time and you get curious…\n\nYou get up and try the door, and find it hasn’t been locked this time. They were probably in too much of a hurry to bother.\n\nYou sort of wonder if you shouldn’t take this opportunity to escape on your own terms, since you still have a bit of a trust problem with Lilith considering she did make a lab rat out of you. (Doesn’t matter if she was “nice” about it)\n\nOf course maybe you’d be safer in here if there crazy cannibals out there.\n",
  "page 112": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou wake up and find that Julie is still fast asleep with her head nestled against your body and one arm draped over you. The funny thing is this sort of thing doesn’t even bother you anymore.\n\nBut your increasingly odd relationship with Julie isn’t excessively important at this time. Right now you’re dwelling more on the grim situation you’re still in and the event less pleasant task you still have ahead of you. Not quite disturbing Julie yet, you reach over and grab your cell phone to check the time. Slept most of the day as usual. Just as well, since you won’t have long to wait for nightfall again when you have to dig another hole out back.\n\n“Julie, get up I have to go.” You say tapping Julie on the head.\n“Hgm,.. no…” she utters.\n“Have to, I’ve got to take care of something and I think you know what it is.”\n\nJulie slowly and reluctantly moves off of you and repositions herself on a pillow.\n\n“I wish you could just stay in bed with me all day.” She says.\n“At this point, I wish that too.” You say and get up to leave to go get your sister out of the washer and dryer.\n\nYou grab your seemingly never-ending supply of garbage bags, cleaning products, some towels, a bucket of water, some rubber gloves and go down into the basement.\n\nOnce again approaching the washer and dryer you open up them up and are bombarded by a horrible smell. You end up coughing and hacking up again.\n\n“Ugh…(pant) ugh…goddamn it, I can get through this…” you say.\n\nYou empty the washing machine first, putting Donna’s dismembered legs and arms in trash bags. You then dump some cleaning products into the washing machine and turn it on figuring that it will least wash most of the blood out.\n\nThe dryer on the other hand is not going to be as easy to clean. Johnny threw Donna’s torso and head in there. While he didn’t exactly eviscerate her, there are definitely some or her insides coming out. It’s a horrible task (You try not to stare at her head for too long), but between the gagging you manage to get through it. Her body, her left over innards and her head all up into bags and tied up.\n\nYou then spend time trying to clean the dryer. Even with using bleach, you can’t get rid of that horrible smell. You wonder if it’ll ever go away.\n\n“Ugh, that’s a really horrible smell.” Julie says causing you to turn your head and see that she’s come down to check on you.\n“What are you doing down here? I told you I’d take care of this.” You say.\n“You were down here awhile and I decided to check on you. Besides, your brother Peter called.”\n“Is that right?”\n“Yep, he was returning your call from yesterday. Didn’t realize you called him.”\n“I was in the middle of calling him when that psycho attacked. Anyway, you talked to him?”\n“Yeah, but I didn’t tell him about what happened here, save for the National Guard coming in and telling us to stay indoors. I didn’t want to tell him about Donna, I figured you’d want to do that.”\n“Thanks. Peter and Donna weren’t exactly the closest either, but I think he’d be pretty upset to hear about her death. So he didn’t want to talk to me?”\n“Well I told him you were really busy cleaning up an awful mess elsewhere in the house. He actually said he didn’t want to talk long though because he was worried that the government was monitoring the phone call what with the marshal law and all.”\n“Huh, sounds almost like something my brother Ben would’ve said.”\n“Yeah, that’s the other thing. He mentioned he was busily trying to locate Ben’s old hidden bunker in your backyard. He said he wants to wait this out in there because he’s scared shitless and feels vulnerable just being stuck in your house by himself.”\n“Well I can see him being scared since this isn’t the most relaxed of situations.”\n“Yeah, but he said its more than just the National Guard. He said he saw a few of your neighbors acting nuttier than a shithouse rat in the streets for no apparent reason. Like they were rabid animals. He mentioned some of them was trying to bite someone.”\n\nYou stop cleaning for a moment.\n\n“What? Crazy people trying to bite others? That almost sounds like something out of a horror movie. You sure he wasn’t exaggerating?”\n“He sure didn’t sound like it, I mean it sort of makes sense. People have become more aggressive and hostile. The crime rate in this town has gone up so bad that the National Guard had to come in. I mean maybe everyone in town is going crazy from some sort of secret military experiment!”\n“If that’s true, then how come we aren’t running around biting people?” you ask.\n“Well maybe it hasn’t affected us yet, maybe we’re immune, I don’t know! Maybe it spreads by bite like in a zombie movie! I’m just saying maybe we should start blocking the windows and doors.”\n“Julie its entirely possible Peter saw some people just high on bath salts! I mean the people who live in my neighborhood aren’t exactly the most morally upstanding. Let’s wait and see for a moment. I mean I’m still cleaning up here, so it’ll be awhile and…”\n\nSuddenly several machine gun shots are heard.\n\n“Oh my God!” Julie says and instinctively ducks. You on the other hand get up off your knees from cleaning and start to head upstairs.\n\n“Are you insane, where are you going?!” Julie asks.\n“Julie, while at one time it would’ve been unthinkable for me to head TOWARDS the sound of gunfire, I’ve left a pistol and an axe upstairs. If nothing else I’d like to retrieve to viable weapons if an impending zombie apocalypse is indeed coming.”\n“Well hold on I’m coming with you, I don’t want to be by myself!” Julie says.\n\nAnd like that you’re cautiously going upstairs towards potential danger with Julie touching one of your arms and hiding behind you. Now you really do feel like you’re in a horror movie.\n\nWhen you get upstairs, you and Julie keep your heads down. The gunfire doesn’t sound like it’s immediately out in front of the house, but it’s definitely nearby. You go and get the pistol first.\n\n“Why is the gun in the cereal box?” Julie asks.\n“Because I was desperately trying to find a place to hide it yesterday. Julie, I think you better go put something a little more protective on. If we need to suddenly leave in a hurry you’re not going to want to be running around in your underwear.”\n“I suppose you’re right. Where are you going to be?”\n“I’m going back to my room to retrieve the axe from the bathroom, wash this blood off and change my clothes as well since I obviously ruined these by cutting and ripping them yesterday in the first place.”\n\nYou and Julie part ways briefly to go take care of your short-term goals. After washing up and changing your clothes again you start to ponder what your next move might be. You don’t quite get to do that since once again you’re interrupted by the breaking of glass coming from the kitchen followed by snarling and grunting.\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim and run to the kitchen to see a bloody arm through the window of the backdoor attempting to unlock it. The thing on the other side gets more excited when it sees you and starts pounding the glass with its other hand cracking more of it. It seems completely oblivious to the fact that it’s severely cutting itself in the process.\n\nIt looks like a regular (if a bit wild) human. It doesn’t look rotten (Could be fresh though) and maybe it isn’t a zombie, but you know damn well you can’t let it get in! You shoot at it through the glass completely shattering the rest of the window. The bullet hits it in the face and the thing falls backwards making one last death growl.\n\nYou cautiously move to look through the broken window and see that you’ve killed it. Meanwhile Julie has come running to see if you’re okay.\n\n“Suzy! Oh thank god! Are you okay?!” Julie asks.\n“Yeah, but I apologize for doubting you and Peter. One of those… things, guess I’ll call them the rabid just attacked. Look what one did to this door, I’d hate to think what more of them might do in a group.” You say.\n“Oh shit! We need to start blocking the doors and windows!”\n“I’m wondering if we shouldn’t just get the hell out of here while we can.”\n“I really think we we’d be safer if we stayed put! I mean we have more than enough furniture and items to barricade ourselves in here. If we leave, we run the risk of bumping into hordes of them and that’s not counting the military who are still shooting people on sight, maybe even more so now. Where would we go anyway?”\n“I admit, I haven’t figured that part out yet, but I think you’re hoping to ride this thing out until shit gets back to normal and I’m wondering if that’s even going to happen. We aren’t exactly well supplied here for a long-term stay even if we do barricade this place. Now I’ll give you that it’s probably going to be dangerous out there, but at least we’ll have more freedom to move around.”\n\nJulie of course will follow you no matter what you decide, but she really wants to stay in. As much as you think it might be better to leave now, you probably would be safe if you barricaded yourselves in the house properly. Things do sound hectic out there right now with all the gunfire, it might even be best if you waited until things died down a bit and sneak out later.\n",
  "page 233": "That last statement doesn’t sound right to you…\n\n“Wait a minute Helen. I thought you said yesterday that Veronica and Brandon ran to you and stayed with the kids when you parted company with them.”\n\nHelen pauses for a moment.\n\n“Uh yeah, I did. Yes! I meant I left the kids alone, but just as I was leaving, it was fortunate that Veronica and Brandon showed up at that time so they weren’t completely alone.”\n\nBobby’s grandmother claimed you were slow on the uptake and maybe in dreamland you are, but you know damn well when someone is obviously lying to you.\n\n“That didn’t happen Helen.” You say.\n“Wha…yes it did!” Helen exclaims.\n“Okay then…” you say and sit down to take off your heels.\n“What are you doing?”\n“I’m taking off these fucking heels because I don’t feel like nearly breaking my neck when we go ask Veronica and Brandon to confirm your story.”\n“Um, I don’t think that will be necessary. In fact, I think Bobby will be fine. Probably just wedding jitters. Apologies for bothering you and glad to see that the dress fits you.” Helen says and starts backing towards the door.\n“You know now that I’m thinking about it, it seems pretty strange that Bobby would be crying and praying in front of Diana who I presume is sitting in a dungeon cage right now.”\n“She was unconscious?” Helen says as if saying it in the tone of a question is going to cause it to be more believable.\n“Unconscious or not, I doubt Bobby would show any sort of weakness around Diana now. In fact I’m starting to doubt a lot of things…”\n\nAt this point Helen’s eyes widen in fear and she turns to run for the door. Just as she gets to the handle, you manage to bean her in the head with one of the heels. It’s just enough to stop her from getting away before you rush over and grab her by the hair and throw her to the floor.\n\n“Out with it bitch.” You say and lock the door.\n\nWhen she doesn’t answer right away, you raise your hand and Helen starts to cry before you’ve even done anything. She cowers by curling up and putting her hands and arms in front of her completely submissively.\n\n“Please! Mercy! It wasn’t my idea! It was all Diana! You just don’t know what it’s like having such a bullying older sister who dominates virtually every aspect of your life!”\n“Save the pity party speech about being a victim of sibling abuse. Heard it before and I already lived something similar so it doesn’t impress me. Besides, I’m not buying this babe in the woods routine anymore Helen. At best you’re lying to cover up the fact that Diana AND yourself were planning on killing me all along yesterday and you just covered your own ass when it looked like things weren’t going to work out. At worst, this entire thing was your idea and Diana was just your dumb ass pawn. Either way, I’m not enthused and it doesn’t change the fact that YOU were trying to kill me…were you going to make another attempt today? Huh? Is that why you came up here? Maybe push me down the stairs or something? Claim it was an accident? ANSWER ME AND DON’T FUCKING LIE!”\n“Okay! Okay! I’ll tell you everything! Just please try to understand it wasn’t personal! I actually like you!”\n“Not personal?! You like me? So I guess your plan to kill me was just your way of showing affection?”\n“No (sob) I did it because I just love (sob) Bobby so much! I always have and I stood on the sidelines too long. (sob) I was just so desperate…”\n\nYou just shake your head and sigh at this point. Helen sits up from the floor and scoots back to prop herself up against your bed coughing, sniffling, and trying to regain her composure. You stand nearby ready to jump on her if she tries anything, but for now you allow this moment for her to “explain” as it were.\n\n“If there had been some way to remove you Suzy without killing you I would have done it. You have to believe me I really would have. I even thought about approaching you in a plan to kill Diana instead.”\n“Yeah and then you would’ve probably killed me afterwards to make it look like Diana and I killed each other.”\n“No! I was going to…well I was going to try to seduce you.”\n“Excuse me?” you say completely surprised by that part of the explanation.\n“Well I wasn’t sure, but I just sort of got a feeling from you that you might be a bit… flexible on your orientation.” Helen says.\n“Wha… (sputter) What the hell would give you that impression?” you exclaim.\n“I dunno…sometimes I thought your eyes were wandering all over my body a little more than average whenever we spoke, plus you were so nice to me and you just sort of give off a lesbian vibe at times. I probably would’ve been too shy to go through with it anyway so it obviously wouldn’t have worked.”\n“You’re damn right that wouldn’t have worked! And what was your plan after that if your main goal was Bobby? Were you going to seduce me and while you were fucking me from behind with a big strap on you were going to plunge a knife in my back?” you ask Helen.\n“No, I told you, if I didn’t have to kill you, I wouldn’t have. I would have just suggested that we both marry Bobby. It’s not common, but our religion does allow for multiple wives. I think… I think I could have shared him with you.”\n\n“…I…I can’t believe how fucked up this situation even is…” you say sitting down on a nearby chair. Meanwhile Helen continues her tale of woe.\n\n“But I approached Diana because she was my sister and I knew her better. She was predictable. After I saw you beat her and after Bobby laid down the law to her about how it was over, she was a broken woman. Seriously, I’d never seen her confidence so shaken. After being on the receiving end of her abuse for so long, it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. So I convinced her of the plan…actually took me longer than I thought it would. I thought she’d be hungry for revenge, but no. I had to reignite that fire, but I knew she’d agree in the end.”\n“So she WAS trying to kill me too.” You say.\n“Oh yes. That was the plan as far as she knew. She’d kill you, but then I’d kill her and make up an excuse that I tried to save you or something similar. Of course when you stayed with Bobby during that whole time we were dealing with Aaron, I knew it wasn’t going to work which then resulted in an argument between me and Diana since she was now back to bullying mode. I knocked her out and I nearly killed her then, but I thought suggesting that she be your sacrifice on your wedding day would be fitting. When I found out Aaron had killed all the other prisoners…well that worked out even better since you suggested it.”\n“But you still wanted to kill me.”\n“Yes…after the chaos of yesterday and after I saw how you stuck by Bobby. I knew you really did love Bobby as much as Diana did…maybe even as much as me. So I temporary rethought my actions. I thought maybe I could live with Bobby being with someone like you. I mean you were nice to me at least. And I knew at least Bobby would be happy with you. When I woke up this morning though, I realized I just couldn’t let you have him without at least making one last ditch effort…and so here we are.”\n\nAt this point Helen starts to lose what little composure she mustered up to tell her side of the story. She starts to break down in tears again and apologizes to you and going on about how much she loves Bobby. It’s really pitiful and sad. You can’t believe you’re almost considering NOT killing her now.\n\nBefore you can come to any sort of conclusion, you hear shooting and screaming from outside. Still keeping an eye on Helen, you edge over to the window and take a peek.\n\nYou see several figures crawling under the truck blocking the broken front gate or trying to climb the fence. The ones that have gotten in are loping in a wild jerky like motion. They’re also screaming, howling and making inhuman sounds. From your vantage point they LOOK human, but they’re certainly not acting like it.\n\nA loud banging on the door occurs next and you glare at Helen who doesn’t make a sound.\n\n“Hey! Suzy! You in there?! Why’s this door locked?” you hear a voice shout. You think its Veronica.\n“Yeah, I’m in here. What’s going on? I just heard all the commotion.” You answer.\n“We’re being attacked by zombies!” Veronica answers.\n\nYou and Helen look over at each other briefly.\n\n“Did you say zombies?” you ask.\n“Yeah, I mean…I dunno if they are. Maybe they’re just rabid humans or something, but they’re gnashing their teeth, moaning and coming at us like something out of a horror movie. We need all the help we can get to repel these things!”\n“Okay, Veronica. I’ll be out in a moment!” you yell.\n“Well hurry up…and you haven’t seen Helen have you?”\n\nHelen and you look at each other again.\n\n“Yeah, she’s in here with me. I was trying on my wedding dress that she brought.” You say.\n“If the pair of you don’t stop playing dress up, there won’t be a damn wedding! Bobby’s having a hard enough time trying to keep them from getting close to the house!”\n\nA loud crashing noise followed by gunfire is heard from downstairs.\n\n“Shit! That sounded close! I gotta go!” Veronica shouts and you hear her run off.\n\nWell it looks like Bobby’s “pep talk” yesterday lit a fire under his relative’s asses to pull their weight around here at least.\n\n“(Sigh) Fucking zombies. Of course this day HAD to get worse…” you say shaking your head.\n“Suzy, we need to go to Bobby, he needs our help.”\n“We?” you ask.\n“…I…look…I know what’s just occurred between us and you have no reason to trust me, but from what Veronica said, it sound like this is a bad attack and we’ll need everyone we can to stop it!”\n\nShe might have a point or she might just be stalling for a chance to escape or clobber you in the head. Possibly both.\n",
  "page 111": "Even if you do run, you could easily bump into more military outside.\n\n“We need to distract them. Julie, go run up stairs and try to clean up your face a bit and then doll yourself up with make up. Put on something sexy, like lingerie.”\n“Wha…what?”\n“Just do it. I’ll call you when I need you.”\n“Suzy…I don’t know…”\n“Julie, just trust me okay?” You say.\n“Okay.” Julie says with a nod and runs off back to her room.\n\nYou run into your bathroom and toss the axe and shovel in there with Johnny’s body and then draw the shower curtain closed.\n\nGrabbing some scissors from the desk, you take your pants off and quickly cut the legs off of them so they resemble shorts and put them back on. You then tear your shirt and tie it up so it’s really accentuating your breasts and exposing your midriff. You then grab some rubber bands and tie your hair in two ponytails on either side of your head.\n\nMore banging on the front door and you run into the kitchen.\n\nYou quickly put the pistol in a half full box of cereal, which you then put back into the cupboard. There isn’t much blood on the floor, but what little there is, you easily wipe up with some water and soap.\n\n“OPEN UP BY THE ORDER OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT!” you hear a voice shout followed by more banging on the door.\n“Hold on! Hold on! I’m coming! I’m coming!” you shout, running to the front door.\n\nLooking through the peephole, you see two soldiers and a man dressed in a business suit.\n\n“I really hope these guys are straight.” You say and open the door.\n\nYou open the door and you lean forward a bit and to the side hoping you look seductive rather than ridiculous (It isn’t like you do this a lot). Judging by the brief pause and the stares, you gather that you achieved seductive rather than ridiculous.\n\n“Miss, didn’t you hear us knocking on the door?” the man in the suit asks.\n“Oh, I’m so sorry I didn’t answer right away, I was just so busy with something and I had to make myself presentable. So how can I help you today?”\n“You can start by letting us in; we heard a gunshot coming from this direction. Granted that hasn’t been an uncommon sound in other parts of this town, but this neighborhood has been fairly quiet and peaceful otherwise, so we’d like to know if you know anything about it. We already got soldiers searching around your backyard and the immediate area.”\n“Oh. I see. Well, you boys come on in and I’ll try to serve you in any way I can. My name is Suzy by the way.”\n\nYou turn around and attempt to put a little swing into your walk. You then you’re your head to look back at them and flutter your eyes a bit. You actually feel really silly doing so, but the grinning expressions you see on the two soldiers suggest that you seem to be doing better than you’d believe.\n\nThe man in the suit tells the two soldiers to stand by the door and he sits down on couch. You then sit close to him.\n\n“Okay, Suzy. You may refer to me as Mr. Zoll. Now you’re aware this town is under marshal law correct?”\n“Yes, we heard loudspeakers outside earlier. It sounded so frightening… should we be worried?” you say.\n“I can’t tell you specifics about such things, however I’m sure you’re aware that this town has experienced a vast increase in criminal activity and rioting. More than your police force can handle. So until we get the situation under control again, we’re here to stay.”\n\nActually you weren’t really aware of that, or at least not to the great extent that it was bad enough to call in the National Guard, but you nod and cross your legs and rub your hand over one of them in a manner that catches the attention of Mr. Zoll.\n\n“So um…”\n“You were saying Mr. Zoll?” you ask.\n“… yeah anyway…so while this is a state of emergency, we don’t want the citizens to feel uncomfortable. We don’t want to just send in soldiers here to search every house for potential troublemakers. I mean this is still a free country and contrary to popular belief, the government is here to help. At least that’s how I have always approached these situations. Much better to work with people than forcing them against their will. Still, as I said, gunfire was heard from this house and we have to investigate. So I’d like to at least ask you questions before deciding if we need to search this house further, you understand.”\n“Oh yes, of course I understand. You have such a difficult job trying to keep our wonderful country safe, I will comply will all your wishes and desires.” You say and then place your hand on Mr. Zoll’s knee in the process.\n\nThis is enough to cause him to smile nervously, but takes your hand off at which point you smile and giggle in return.\n\n“Okay first of all you keep using the term ‘we’ is there someone else here?”\n“Oh yes. I’ll call her down. Julie! Could you come down here? There is a man that wants to ask us some questions about the gunshot earlier.” you say standing up from the couch.\n\nJulie appears and thankfully the girl has pulled out all the stops. She’s wearing purple lingerie underneath and her legs are covered by purple stocking with garters. She’s also wearing all the usual makeup that makes her look like a cheap whore and that’s definitely a plus right now since everyone is looking at her. Julie walks down the stairs in such a manner that continues to keep their eyes on her. While she probably knows what some of your plan is by now, the rest of it is probably going to surprise her.\n\n“Mr. Zoll, this is Julie, my life partner of many years. Come over here and sit sweetie.” You say taking a seat in a chair.\n\nJulie is indeed surprised by this, but quickly knows to play along. The two soldiers meanwhile can barely keep their mouths from hanging open. Mr. Zoll is better at keeping it together, but he’s unsure of whether to stare at you or Julie and where!\n\n“Julie. Don’t sit all the way over there baby. Come over here.” You say and pat you hands on your lap. Julie now has a bigger smile than anyone as she hops into your lap and puts her arms around you. You then give Julie a kiss on the lips; Julie however gets a bit overzealous by slipping you the tongue and grabbing one of your breasts.\n\n“Now, now, honey, we have company.” You say smiling and putting her hand back. “I apologize Mr. Zoll, but we plan on finally getting officially married soon, now that it’s become legal and we were sort of celebrating before you knocked on the door. We’ve been friends and lovers for so long that its so liberating to long at last have the freedom to do what everyone else does. Did you know we came out to each other when we were sixteen? It was almost magical how we just knew it was so right in that high school shower room… “\n\nNow Mr. Zoll crosses his legs because he’s probably hiding a big boner. The soldiers at this point are unsubtly “rearranging” but it looks more like they just want to whip it out and start whacking it. Zoll manages to get back on track.\n\n“Ladies, I really need to ask about this gunshot so let’s get to it.”\n\nYou and Julie say you heard a gunshot behind the house and not much else. Julie then mentions that she saw someone through the window jumping over the back fence, but couldn’t make out what they looked like. Then she describes what they look like they were wearing from the back.\n\n“All I know is I was so scared that I hopped right back into bed and held on to my Suzy.” Julie says and hugs you a little tighter.\n“There, there, it’s over now. These big strong men are here to protect us from lawless scum like that.” You say looking at Julie and rubbing her legs.\n\nYou turn back to Mr. Zoll.\n\n“So that’s all we know Mr. Zoll. I hope it was helpful. As I said if you must search this house we understand, but I as a law abiding citizen of this country I do hope it isn’t necessary.” You say to Mr. Zoll who looks like he’s trying to scan you for deception.\n\n“Nah, I don’t think that will be necessary. You two seem like a nice couple that just wants to live your lives and be free to do… whatever you want to each other in the privacy of your own home. Whoever is dumb enough to run around in this neighborhood firing off guns is bound to fuck up soon and we at least know a partial description now. Okay anyway, onto the second reason for my visit. Do you need anything? We’re not just here to keep order, but to help out as well. While you’re quite aware that you can’t leave your home, we could bring some basic supplies like food to you. So anything?”\n\nAny other time you might take them up on the offer, but right now you just want them gone.\n\n“Perhaps another time. Nothing right now thanks.” You answer.\n“Well hopefully for all of us, this will all be over soon. Okay, I leave you two ladies.”\n\nMr. Zoll tells his men that they’re leaving (who seem very disappointed). A few more glances back at you and Julie and soon they’re out the door. It’s over and you’re safe.\n\n“Holy shit, I can’t believe we pulled that off.” You say slumping a bit in your chair and breathing a sigh of relief.\n“Oh Suzy, that was fucking genius!” Julie says who is still in your lap and hugging and kissing on your face.\n“Stop, it’s over now, get off my lap. I still got a body to chop up and to dispose of.”\n\nJulie ceases her affection and gets off your lap, though she looks a little hurt. Not wishing to cause more distress for her you apologize.\n\n“Look, sorry. I just…I still lost a sister and that’s been going through my head since I found out today.”\n“No, I understand. She was my friend. I don’t think I’ve even processed her death fully due to my own near death experience and the National Guard coming in here. I’ll leave you to it.”\n\nJulie heads back upstairs and you return to your bathroom where Johnny’s body still awaits your destruction.\n\nThe thing is now; you don’t feel like it anymore. The rage and sadness are still there of course, but what is chopping his body up really going to do for you? Nothing except more work and you refuse to expend any more energy than you have to on this scum.\n\nYou get more trash bags and cover his upper half with one and his lower half with another. Then you duct tape them around him until he’s wrapped pretty tightly.\n\nYou then wait until dark and head outside in the backyard with the shovel. Luckily Julie’s fences are high enough that nobody is going to immediately see you. (It’s a big yard anyway and the neighbors aren’t very close either) The night is actually pretty quiet, though you do hear the occasional rumble of what sounds like trucks or some sort of military vehicles driving on the nearby roads.\n\nIt isn’t exactly the easiest thing in the world digging in the ground at night, but luckily Julie’s yard also has some pretty soft soil and it only takes most of the night as opposed to all of it. You then return back to retrieve Johnny’s body and see Julie waiting nearby.\n\n“You could probably use the help in carrying this asshole right?” Julie asks.\n“It would welcome.” You say.\n\nThe pair of you lifts Johnny and carrying him outside and dump him into the hole you dug and then proceed to fill up. You and Julie then return inside the house.\n\n“Well that’s that.” Julie says.\n“Yep. And I’m going to bed.” You say.\n“Suzy?”\n“Julie, I know. Donna still needs to be taken care of. I just don’t have any more energy today. I can’t deal with it now, I’m so drained it’s taken all my energy not to just break down and cry.”\n“I know today has been rough for you and I wasn’t talking about Donna. I just wanted to say I don’t know what I would’ve done if you hadn’t been here to take care of all this. You really went above and beyond today Suzy. I’m never going to forget it.”\n\nJulie says and goes to hug you and kisses you on the cheek. She then faintly smiles and walks away.\n\nYou don’t know what’s going on with you, and honestly you’re too tired to sort out all the cocktail of emotions you’ve been bombarded with lately, but right now you do know Julie doesn’t really want to be alone.\n\n“Julie, you don’t need to got to you room, come on into my room.”\n“Are you sure?”\n“Yeah, I’d hate for the National Guard to suddenly show up and expose us as liars.” You manage to joke which causes a bit of a smile from Julie.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep all you can think is “How can this week get any worse?”\n",
  "page 232": "If Bobby’s feeling a little down about everything and Helen feels like you could cheer him up, it couldn’t hurt to go see him right now. Not like you’ve got anything better to do.\n\n“Alright, I’ll go see him. I suppose I might as well get used to walking around in this thing.” You say.\n“Oh I know he’ll be so glad to see you, here let me get the door.” Helen says and opens it for you.\n\nYou walk down the corridor with Helen nearby going on about how she’s so glad you’re officially going to be part of the family.\n\n“And don’t worry, when you start having all those babies, I can certainly help you out on that front.”\n“Great. I’ll be looking forward to it…” you say unenthusiastically while at the same time still trying to maintain your balance on the heels.\n\nWhen you get to the stairs you stop.\n\n“Shit, I think I should take these heels off before heading downstairs. I don’t want to fall.” You say.\n“Oh don’t worry about that, just hang on to the railing and I’ll be right here to make sure you don’t fall. In fact I can even put my arm around you just to make sure you don’t.” Helen says and goes to balance you a bit.\n“Well thanks, but I really don’t need your arm around m…” you start to say and then Helen punches you in the face.\n\nThe punch itself isn’t even that hard as far as punches go, in fact Helen even winces when she does it as if she wasn’t confident in her abilities and was reluctant to even do so.\n\nHowever combined with being on top of the stairs and your high heels you lose your balance completely and go tumbling down them.\n\nFalling down a flight of stairs is always a bit of a crapshoot, sometimes people survive it with just a few bumps and bruises and other times they break their necks and die before they reach the bottom.\n\nYou fall somewhere in between, you break your neck, but you don’t die. You won’t be moving anytime soon though. You’d probably be in more horror about the situation of not being able to move if your head wasn’t so scrambled from the fall.\n\nAs you struggle to remain conscious, you see Helen coming down the stair before you. Her face has a sad expression.\n\n“Oh no. I was afraid this might happen.” She says with the tone of being genuinely upset.\n\nAs Helen approaches and kneels near your head you both hear the sounds of gunfire outside and shouting inside the house. Neither of you know what that’s about, but you’re in no condition to worry about it.\n\nHelen picks your head up and speaks.\n\n“Sorry Suzy, but I just love Bobby too much to let you have him. I wish there could’ve been another way, but I’ll make this quick.”\n\nYou don’t respond, you just close your eyes and let go.\n\nAnd then a final snap.\n",
  "page 114": "Things are too hot out there right now. The National Guard is parked firmly in the neighborhood; you wouldn’t have a chance to get past them.\n\nNo, the best thing to do is barricade yourself in. You have enough supplies to last the remainder of the week you think.\n\n“Okay, let’s block the doors and windows the best we can. Those shots might have the National Guard over here again, but at least we can point to a viable target this time.” You say.\n“What about your… um sister?” Julie asks.\n“(Sigh) Shit. I dunno. She’s all wrapped up in bags right now, I guess I’ll just throw her in the garbage can out in your backyard. It’s near the door, so I won’t have to linger too long.”\n“You really want to throw her away like that?”\n“No, I don’t fucking want to throw away my sister like she was just day old meatloaf, but I don’t have many other options right now and if we are going to be stuck in this house for who knows how many days on end, I don’t want my sister’s chopped up corpse sharing it with us! Now start pushing shit against the front door and block the windows!”\n\nWhile Julie goes to follow your orders, you head back down in the basement to grab your sister’s remains. It takes two trips and a lot of paranoia, but you manage to get her all in the trash can without anything else attacking you or the military coming to check up on you again. You do hear a lot more shooting though, so you’re guessing that maybe they’re too occupied with something else. You finish up by shoving the refrigerator in front of the back door.\n\nJulie meanwhile is trying her best. She’s got the front door barricaded well enough, but the windows leave something to be desired.\n\n“Julie, anyone could crash through those windows right now. Don’t you have like hammer and nails or something laying around?” you ask.\n“No, and I don’t have a bunch of wooden planks either. Why the hell would I have that shit? I don’t sit around thinking about how to best protect my home against a possible zombie attack!” Julie answers. Her state of agitation is vastly increasing under the pressure.\n“I don’t think they’re dead…nevermind doesn’t matter. (Sigh) Okay, you’re obviously stressed. Why don’t you take a break and I’ll handle this. I’ll try to figure out a way to better barricade this place.”\n\nJulie doesn’t need you to say anymore and she immediately runs upstairs. You imagine she’s probably going to pop some pills or something to mellow her out. At this point as long as she stays out of your way, you’ll be able to get what you need to do accomplished.\n\nYou spend a good amount of time shoving as much furniture as you can in front of most of the ground floor windows. Something could definitely still break them and with enough force they’d probably eventually knock through the furniture, but you’re confident that you’d at least have enough time to do something about it before they got in completely.\n\nStill, the gunfire and yelling from outside hasn’t stopped the whole time you’re doing this, there are a couple points where you hear some explosions too, so you’re not exactly feeling completely relaxed about this situation.\n\nYou then start packing “get a away” bags with as many useful items as you can, just in case you need to leave in a hurry. One of your bags that you brought hasn’t even been opened and is still full of clothing. You fill your other bags with more useful items like some of the non-perishable snack food Julie has, the duct tape you were using, a few of the bigger kitchen knives, loose batteries, some of the medicine in the bathroom, etc.\n\nYou then finish up with packing a few more of your personal items and then think if you do need to leave in a hurry, it probably would be best if you could drive out of here.\n\nYou head upstairs and start calling for Julie, but when you find her, she’s laying on her bed in a semi-conscious state. She took something to calm herself just as you figured.\n\n“Julie! Julie! Does Donna have a spare set of car keys?” you ask.\n“Mgh…huh…come to bed…” she says.\n“Julie! I need to know if Donna had spare keys to her car!” you shout.\n“I dunno…yeah…prob…dresser…” Julie utters and starts to become even less coherent.\n\nSeeing that she’s going to be of no more use for the rest of the day, you search Donna’s room for her car keys and fortunately Julie was correct in that they were on the dresser.\n\nBy this point, night has fallen and while the gunfire has lessened, you still hear the occasional shot. You’re a little tired from all the running around and other activity you’ve been doing to today, not to mention you’re still wearing the clothing that you cleaned your sister up in. As much as you’re hesitant to let your guard down, you absolutely feel the need to clean up.\n\nAfter a quick shower, you return to being on guard for something to happen. Anything. Julie of course is peacefully asleep and oblivious to anything that’s going on at this time.\n\nYou peek out one of the second floor windows and see Guardsmen still patrolling, but it doesn’t look like there’s as many any more and you see a pile of what are probably bodies a little up the block. It does look like things have quieted down a bit, around here anyway. Who knows about the rest of the town.\n\nYou wonder if you shouldn’t sneak out and leave while things are quieter, but Julie’s not in any condition to leave now. And as inept as she’s been today, you can’t just abandon her. You’ve just lost your sister, you’re not going to lose your best friend as well.\n\nYou stay up late past midnight staying alert, but nothing happens. You wander back and forth through the house until eventually even you can’t fight off the sleep and you return to your room and close your eyes for just a moment…\n",
  "page 235": "You can’t trust her. Even if you wanted to, you can’t do it. She’s actually proven to be more dangerous than Diana could hope to be, if she’s weaved multiple murder plots against you this week.\n\nYou don’t have a choice. You have to kill her. In fact the more you look at how weak and helpless she is right now…\n\nYou WANT to kill her.\n\n“Alright, get up Helen, let’s go help Bobby.” You say offering a hand to help her up.\n\nHelen looks up at you and takes your hand trustingly. When she stands up, she starts to look relieved.\n\nAnd that’s when you back hand her and shove her to the floor.\n\nHelen holds the side of her face and tries to back away.\n\n“No! No! No! You can’t! Please! No! Don’t kill me!” she utters.\n“Don’t kill you? I’ll kill you twice you fucking cunt! And trust me, it’s not going to look like an accident!” you say and pounce on top of Helen.\n\nYou begin beating Helen like she stole something. Helen pathetically attempts to defend herself, but it predictably doesn’t work. Her pleading for you to stop doesn’t help either. Instead, your hands stop beating her face and then start to wrap around her neck. You want to stop that infernal wailing, the pleading, the crying, everything.\n\nShe tries to stop you from choking her, but your grip is firm. Her eyes begin to bulge a bit and she attempts to catch what is little left of her breath.\n\nThen you do something you don’t even expect doing. You start to giggle. You’ve gone beyond anger and are starting to enjoy this. Meanwhile Helen begins to gurgle and gasp what sounds to be words.\n\n“What? What’s that? You trying to speak? You having a little trouble? Here, whisper it to me.” You mock and get slightly closer while still maintaining your grip.\n\n“Bo…Bob..by…he…help…plea…” you hear Helen gasp.\n“What? Bobby help you? He can’t help you. He’s not even here.” You sneer.\n\nAs Helen’s face turn an unnatural color, you just smile.\n\n“Shhh…shhh…just let go Helen…just let go…you fucking bitch…”\n\nThe light in her eyes starts to fade, the life begins to leave her body and her struggle is soon over. She ceases moving.\n\nIgnoring the gunfire and yelling you hear downstairs, you just continue to sit on top of her for a moment staring at her. You stroke her hair.\n\nYou’ve finally crossed that line. You know you can kill someone if you have to. Actually you also know you can kill someone if you don’t have to and while you went through a variety of emotions leading to it and during it, now that it’s over, you don’t feel much of anything.\n\nYou wonder if your Uncle Ed felt this when he killed someone. Maybe you take after him in some way? Could it be genetic and maybe you have some sort of latent serial killer tendency? Given your family, it isn’t that hard to imagine insanity runs in it.\n\nIt sure would explain why you were so comfortable with Bobby in the first place. After all, what rational woman would stay with a man that runs a murderous cult?\n\nBut these are all things you can dwell on later; right now you need to help Bobby.\n\n“You know…you did have pretty eyes.” You say with a smirk and stand up.\n\nYou open the clothing drawer where Bobby keeps the spare gun he mentioned yesterday, take it and leave the room without even changing your clothes.\nAnd why should you? It’s your wedding day after all.\n\nThe events that follow aren’t nearly as interesting as the experience of your first kill. By the time you get to where Bobby and the rest of his family are holding back the invaders, they’ve already killed most of them. You remember shooting a couple of the things, but it wasn’t nearly as exciting as choking the life out of Helen.\n\nTurns out they weren’t zombies anyway. Just seemingly mad humans trying to eat you. You can only guess your town is overrun by them and this is what Aaron was referring to when he said people were eating each other out there.\n\nSome sort of sickness perhaps? Maybe the government was fucking around with a secret weapon like they tend to do and it got out of hand. It would explain why there was a drastic rise in violence even before you left and why the National Guard showed up later.\n\nIt isn’t until after all the mad attackers are killed that Bobby manages to address you directly. He’s incredibly tired looking, the rest of his family looks pretty tired too, but he looks like he’s about to collapse.\n\nBobby asks you if you’re okay and of course you say you’re fine. He then tells the rest of his family to check the rest of the house just to make sure the situation is completely safe. After everyone leaves, he sits down in a nearby chair wiped out from this whole ordeal.\n\n“I think you need to sleep.” You say.\n“Can’t. Too much to do. Especially now. Bodies to clean up, walls to patch up, gates and doors to fix. Now we got these…things attacking and who knows if any more will wander this way… there’s just so much to do...” Bobby says trying to fight the exhaustion.\n“Let me take care of some of this. You don’t have to do this all by yourself you know.” You say.\n“…shit…the wedding. That’s another thing we need to do…I just…had no fucking time to make the preparations…I’m sorry this couldn’t be how it should…” Bobby adds.\n“Will you not worry about that? Look, does this wedding really need to be so complicated? Can’t we just get one of your family members to witness it and another to marry us right now so I can at last be your wife properly?” you ask.\n“We don’t even need to do that really…I mean I’m the high priest here. All I have to do is say the passage and you accept and we’re married. No need for witnesses, I mean Tiamat’s watching. Who else is needed?”\n“What? That’s it? We could’ve done that a long time ago!”\n“Well, like I’ve told you before, I just wanted it to be perfect…”\n\nYou sit in Bobby’s lap and wrap your arms around him.\n\n“Bobby, just being with you, is enough perfection for me. Besides, isn’t the carnage surrounding us true perfection in the eyes of Tiamat’s chaotic glory or something?” you ask.\n\nBobby looks around at the nearby mess of broken furniture and the couple bodies laying on the floor and smiles.\n\n“Yes, I suppose you’re right.” He says.\n\nBobby recites what you guess is a passage from whatever holy book of Tiamat he got it from and when the time comes, you accept your place as his wife.\n\nThen the both of you kiss like you’ve done so many times before, though this time it’s different. You now feel like you belong here.\n\n“Oh. Here. I’ve been carrying this in my pocket the whole day, nearly forgot it was there.” Bobby remarks and hands you a ring with a sizable red diamond in the center and smaller black inlayed around it. It’s definitely beautiful and when you try it on, you find that it fits perfectly.\n\n“Let me guess, this used to be your grandmother’s ring?” you ask.\n“Yeah…how did you know?”\n“Oh let’s just say the fact that it fits me so well like her wedding dress did was a clue.”\n“Yeah, I was meaning to ask about that.” Bobby says rubbing your legs.\n“Oh Helen gave me the dress to try on before all the trouble went down. Didn’t really have time to change.”\n“(Yawn) Where is Helen anyway? I didn’t see her with you when you arrived, but then I was in the middle of blasting some freak’s head off at the time.”\n“Oh she stayed upstairs.” You say.\n“Hm, probably looking after the children as usual. She’s really reliable that way, (Yawn) nice girl. That’s why didn’t believe the bullshit Diana was spouting about her when I was cleaning up the dungeon.”\n“Oh? What was that?”\n\nBobby begins to close his eyes, but keeps talking.\n\n“Oh, she was trying to claim Helen set her up and the attempt on your life was all her plan and how she never wanted to kill me at all…(yawn) typical desperation to save her own ass. Pretty laughable that she thought I’d believe it, I mean Helen likes you.”\n“Hm…where is Diana now?”\n“Oh she’s still in her cage…(yawn).”\n\n“Good. I’m going to go kill her.” You say.\n“You, don’t need to you know. You (yawn) don’t need to prove anything. I can do it.”\n“No, it’s fine. I’m willing to do it. I mean maybe this isn’t going to be official or how you planned, but I’m part of this family now and I’m going to make the effort to be fully part of it because I love you.”\n\nAt this point Bobby smiles at your words and his consciousness fades completely and he’s asleep. You give him another kiss and get up to head to the dungeon.\n\nWhen you get there you see Diana sitting in her cage with a bored expression. When she sees you, she ceases looking as bored.\n\n“It’s you.” She says and her eyes begin to examine your clothing and then wander over to your finger sporting your new status in the family. She also spies the pistol in your hand.\n\n“I…heard a lot of noise upstairs. Is Bobby okay?”\n“Don’t you worry about Bobby. He’s not your concern anymore.”\n“So…you’re the new top mama now?”\n\nYou don’t answer you just raise your arms presenting yourself to signify that is the case. Her head hangs briefly knowing she’s truly defeated.\n\n“Shit… can you at least tell me if Helen’s dead?”\n“Yes, she’s dead.” You answer.\n\nThis revelation while not making any impact on Diana’s ultimate fate still brings a brief bit of happiness to her.\n\n“Good…that’s good… okay, no point in dragging this out.” Diana says and stands as close as she can to the bars and you get slightly closer with the pistol drawn.\n\n“Fuck Tiamat and fuck you blondie.” Diana says and then you fire a round into her chest.\n\nDiana falls back wheezing, gasping and clutching at the bloody wound. You move in closer to watch her for the last few minutes she clings to life, but then eventually she follows her sister in death.\n\nAnd now your “competition” has completely been eliminated.\n\nLeaving Diana in much the same way you left Helen, you go back upstairs and attempt to take charge of some of what needs to be done around the house.\n\nIt’s actually easier than you think. Bobby’s family is a little surprised by the fact that you and he got married so spur of the moment, but that’s not a problem and given the recent events, they were less focused on attending a formal wedding anyway. You tell Veronica to go check on the children and to make sure they’re okay, when she seems less than enthused to do it and asks where Helen is, you get in her face and tell her.\n\n“She’s dead.”\n“What?! Well shouldn’t we tell Bobby?” Veronica exclaims with the rest of the family looking a little surprised at this revalation.\n“Bobby needs his rest and I’m calling the shots while he does so, now just do what the hell I say Veronica. The rest of you help me move these corpses out of here and Bobby’s sleeping in the living room near the kitchen. Let’s try not to wake him.”\n\nClean up goes relatively fast. Around the house at least since that’s your primary concern. You go for the quick dirty approach of just getting all the dead bodies in one pile outside. You briefly think about burning them, but then you worry that maybe that might attract more attention. You figure Bobby can make that decision tomorrow.\n\nSince you’re not any sort of carpenter or anything similar your solution to patch up any broken windows and the front door is to barricade it with furniture for the night.\n\nSomewhere just after midnight everyone is ready to crash. You take mercy on everyone and tell them to just sleep with a weapon tonight and you’ll take tonight’s watch. You aren’t sure how you’re going to do it with as tired as you are, but fortunately when you check on Bobby you find that he’s just waking up and after a bit of a report, he is pleasantly surprised by what you’ve done.\n\n“Well that’s at least a few things I don’t need to worry about. Probably a good idea on not burning the bodies yet. We can do that tomorrow when everyone is alert in case it does draw attention. Nice job in taking charge.”\n“Thanks.” You say with a yawn.\n“Why don’t you go upstairs and get some sleep. I’m good now. I can take watch.”\n“You sure? You were up longer than I was.”\n“Nah, I’m really fine. I don’t usually need much sleep anyway. I just needed the brief recharge. Hey, we’re in this together remember? I’ll take over now.” He says.\n\nYou don’t argue you just kiss him goodnight and tell him you love him and to call you if he needs your help.\n\nYou head upstairs back to your bedroom feeling sleep creep up on you ever faster.\n\nWhen you get to your bedroom, you find Helen still lying on the floor where you left her. Besides forgetting to clean up her body, you also forgot to tell Bobby about what happened to her. (You didn’t really tell the rest of his family either, you just said she was dead and they never really asked how she died.)\n\nYou look at Helen’s corpse again and then look over at the portrait of Grandma Morningstar with its eyes watching everything as usual.\n\n“Fuck it, he can find out tomorrow. I’m tired and I undoubtedly still have your ghostly mindfuck bullshit to look forward to in dreamland tonight.” You say.\n\nStepping over Helen’s body, you get into bed and fall asleep.\n",
  "page 113": "Things aren’t going to “calm down”, they’re just going to get worse if anything. You’ve already had too many intruders inside this house, staying here obviously isn’t safe even if you do barricade it. You need to get out now.\n\n“Julie get some bags and start packing items like flashlights and the like because we’re getting the hell out of here.” You say.\n“But again, where are we going to go?” she asks.\n“And I still don’t know, but I’m thinking we need to at least get out of this town though. From there I guess we’ll play it by ear. Your car is still at the shop so we’re going to have to use Donna’s. Do you know if Donna had a spare set of car keys? When I had to…clean up, it wasn’t like she was clothed at the time so there wasn’t anything on her.”\n“She probably left her keys on a dresser in her room when she first stormed in the house on Monday. I’ll check. Speaking of Donna, what are you going to do about her? I mean you were going to bury her, but now?”\n“Yeah, I’m sort of wishing I’d buried her first instead of the asshole that killed her now. I dunno, I mean there just isn’t time. (Sigh) Fuck it, she’s just an empty shell now, the person that she was is gone and we need to make haste if we don’t want to end up like her, so let’s start getting a move on.”\n\nJulie and you both split up to pack your bags. One of your bags that you brought hasn’t even been opened and is still full of clothing. You fill your other bags with more useful items like some of the non-perishable snack food Julie has, the duct tape you were using, a few of the bigger kitchen knives, loose batteries, some of the medicine in the bathroom, etc.\n\nYou then finish up with packing a few more of your personal items and are ready to go.\n\n“Julie, are you ready yet and did you find the keys?!” you call up to her.\n“Yeah, yeah I’m just making sure I got everything!” she calls back.\n\nYou hear more gunfire coming from outside which sounds like its right outside the front door. A quick look out the window and you do see several guardsmen firing on those crazy people running at them. It looks like the National Guard have set up a bit of a “base” in one of the houses further up the street. You just hope you can drive off without too much problem. You’re going to have to be quick that’s for sure.\n\nJulie comes running down the stairs with two bags and a big luggage case.\n\n“Julie, what the hell, I told you to just focus on the essentials!”\n“I did! I need all this…shit!” Julie says and trips down the stairs due to all the stuff she’s trying to lug around and going at a fast pace. You attempt to keep her from breaking her neck by getting in the way of her fall. You’re partially successful though getting crushed by a tumbling body and heavy bags isn’t fun.\n\n“Fuck…shit…goddamn…” you utter as you feel the pain. Surprisingly Julie doesn’t seem any worse for wear.\n“Wow. That was lucky. Thanks Suzy.” She says in a bit of an animated tone. You look at her eyes and see that her pupils dilated.\n“Julie are you fucking high right now?”\n“Uh…I don’t know…”\n“Goddamnit Julie, really?”\n“I needed a little to take the edge off! I mean I’ve been practically sober for the past few days and I needed something to keep myself from breaking down completely! I’ve already proven I’m no good in these high stress situations and now we’re going to enter a whole new level of fucked upness by leaving this house! I’m sorry if I’m not as strong as you!”\n\nYou don’t really have time to argue with Julie about this right now, but she might have a point. If drugs are going to keep her from melting down into a quivering mess then maybe it is for the best that she’s a little high. The funny thing is before all this happened you were the one that was a bit more of a worrywart and Julie tended to have a more laid back approach to life. Just goes to show how one can never tell how people will react in an emergency situation.\n\n“Alright fine, but we’re going to deal with this later and where are the car keys? I’ll be damned if I’m going to let you drive in your condition.”\n\nGrabbing the keys from Julie, you pick yourself up and grab your own bags and cautiously open the front door.\n\n“Alright we need to throw these bags in the back of car as quick as possible and then drive off equally as fast. These weekend warriors are patrolling all over this neighborhood and who knows where those rabid things are.”\n\nYou and Julie run over to the car and open up the doors and start throwing in your bags. Takes a moment for Julie to shove in her big luggage case, but she gets it in. The pair of you then get in the front seats of the car and you start up the car.\n\nYou actually manage to swing the car out into the street before you hear shouting and then fired upon. Julie screams as the sounds of glass shatter behind you from the bullets. You keep it together and just drive hoping that there aren’t too many of the guard in front of you.\n\nIt’s a false hope as you do indeed bump into more than a couple patrols with itchy trigger fingers. Some you try to avoid by going down other streets. Others are actually busy fighting off others. How you and Julie aren’t hit by any that do shoot at you is something of a minor miracle, but the car certainly doesn’t come through unscathed since by the time you manage to make out of Julie’s neighborhood, it’s making rattling sounds.\n\n“Oh god! I knew we shouldn’t have left! The car’s gonna die and then so will we!” Julie shouts.\n“Julie take some more of your happy pills or calm the fuck down, I’m trying to think! Shit! There’s some of those things!” you say as you smash the car into two insane looking individuals that just jumped out of nowhere. One goes flying off to the side and the other falls backwards in front of your car, which then promptly runs over him entirely.\n\nYou continue to drive and try to keep off the main streets though with your car now making several clattering sounds you’re not exactly keeping a low profile.\n\n“We’re never going to make it out of this town! Not with the car in this condition! We need to go back!” Julie exclaims.\n“We can’t go back now Julie! I told you to take some more of… whatever it is you take and let me try to fucking think!” you say while trying to keep an eye on your immediate surroundings.\n\n“Okay. I’m thinking that we’re currently not too far from my house. I suppose we could go there and try to help Peter look for my brother’s shelter and hold up in there. At the very least we could exchange cars there. I’m sure Peter isn’t going to have any intention on using his.\n\nJulie doesn’t really answer you, she’s too busy digging in her pockets for pills. You decide to just go ahead and head to your house.\n\nYour drive there isn’t quite as eventful as your escape from Julie’s house, but it isn’t without peril. The National Guard isn’t quite as in control in your part of the town and there are far more of the rabid roaming around either chasing down normal people or attempting to break into houses. Most of them don’t attempt to attack you, or if they do, you just continue driving fast enough that they don’t get the chance.\n\nBy the time you get to your own house, your neighborhood is eerily quiet. There are definitely signs of past conflict all over the place, but there is nobody on the streets and most homes are not lit either. (Though you do see broken doors and windows on a lot of them) Fortunately your own house doesn’t look damaged (At least not from the front)\n\nYou half expect to get swarmed by crazies as soon as you park in front of your house, but instead your only major concern is herding Julie’s high ass to the front door and getting inside with all the bags you’re both carrying.\n\n“PETER?! Are you here?!” you call out when you get in the door since you saw his vehicle in the driveway. There is no answer though. You dump all your bags on the floor while Julie practically just collapses on the floor with her bags.\n\nYou help her up and lay her down on the sofa and see that she’s feeling quite numb now, though she still tries to grip on to you when you pull away.\n\n“Suzy, don’t leave me…please…”\n“Julie, I have to see if Peter’s in the house or if it’s just us. I won’t be that far away.”\n“Suzy…I’m sorry I’m so fucked up…I don’t know what…I would’ve done if you weren’t around…”\n“Julie, just rest right now.”\n\nWith this last bit of reassurance Julie faintly smiles and closes her eyes.\n\nThe first thing you do is search the ground floor. Amazingly it doesn’t look like your house has been attacked at all. Even looking out into the backyard things look fairly untouched.\n\nThen you search the connected garage and that’s when you wish you hadn’t.\n\nYou find Peter and another unknown man both not quite entirely dressed, but that isn’t the disturbing part. The fact that they’re both dead is the disturbing part.\n\nThe garage itself is a bit of a mess, like there was definitely a struggle, and your brother’s body and the body of who you presume is his lover or client both show signs of blunt trauma. Looks like their necks were both broken to ultimately kill them though.\n\nYou aren’t sure what to think. You feel like you should be more upset than you are, but given what you’ve already experienced you’ve become desensitized. You’re actually more concerned with how this happened. There isn’t anyone else here to your knowledge and if it had been one of those things, the bodies would probably have bite marks. You suppose it could’ve been regular bandits or robbers, but you’d expect gunshot or even knife wounds and neither have that.\n\nAlso if it was bandits that killed them, you wonder why they wouldn’t take Peter’s car since his keys are still sitting on a dresser nearby. Whether Peter was planning on leaving himself or still looking for Ben’s hidden shelter (And if he found it or not) you’ll never know you suppose.\n\nIn any event you have the means to leave immediately if you so desire which given the uneasiness of this situation might not be a bad idea, but then again it’s starting to get dark so it still might be best to bunk here for the night at least.\n",
  "page 115": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou are awakened by a loud explosion, a close one. One so close in fact that the force of it causes you to roll off your bed.\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim as you hit the floor, still tired, but very much awake. You don’t know what time it is, but you know you haven’t been asleep very long.\n\nYou grab your pistol, which is nearby, and the smell of gunpowder, smoke and fire are immediately starting to become very strong.\n\nYou exit your room and see that your barricade of the front facing windows has been destroyed along with that portion of the house. Furniture is in pieces and some of it is burning. That isn’t all that is in pieces however. You see the remains of several bodies. One bloody legs looks like it was wearing a military outfit, a couple of the other parts are of the more civilian persuasion.\n\nYou can only guess this might’ve been a soldier desperately trying to escape and blew himself up either on purpose or accidently in an attempt to kill the rabid things after him.\n\nYou can’t make out everything from where you’re standing, but the streets are swarming with hordes of those things. It would appear a “second wave” has popped up and is strong enough to overwhelm the military here.\n\nEven Julie has woken up.\n\n“Holy shit Suzy! What the fuck…” Julie says from above.\n“Julie get whatever…”\n“SUZY LOOK OUT!” Julie screams.\n\nYou react just in time to shoot one of those rabid fuckers twice in the chest. He goes down and doesn’t get back up, but that’s of little help since you’ve now just attracted even more of them and they’re running in your direction.\n\n“Julie climb out one the upstairs windows!” you shout, firing at two more rabid before running away yourself. Julie immediately runs back into her bedroom.\n\nYou’d follow her, but the burning debris makes it difficult and your own distance to the stairs isn’t close enough for you to get there before more rabid come gibbering in.\n\nYou instead head for the backdoor and fire off the remainder of your bullets as you run. You might’ve actually managed to make out had the back door not been barricaded with the refrigerator.\n\nYou don’t even get to open the back door before you’re roughly pulled backwards and you feel a set of teeth sinking shoulder. This is soon followed by more teeth and your screams.\n",
  "page 236": "While you’re very tempted to kill her, the immediate threat at hand does present the need for every possible person to help even if that means throwing Helen to the zombies to buy yourself time if you need to.\n\n“Alright, get up Helen, let’s go help Bobby.” You say offering a hand to help her up.\n\nHelen looks up at you and takes your hand trustingly. When she stands up, she starts to look relieved, then she tenses up again when you go to Bobby’s clothing drawer to get the spare gun he mentioned yesterday.\n\n“Relax, this is for the zombies, or whatever those things are.” You say.\n“Oh.”\n“Yeah, well don’t look too relieved Helen. After this is over, me and you are going to settle up.” You say.\n“I…understand.” Helen says while nodding.\n“Okay then, you first.” You say gesturing towards the door.\n“Wait, aren’t you going to change?” Helen asks.\n“Huh? Oh. No, it’s my fucking wedding day, why shouldn’t I wear my dress?”\n“Um, okay then.”\n\nHelen cautiously unlocks and opens the door. You both hear the sounds of gunfire and more glass breaking downstairs, this followed by shouting and inhuman growling.\n\n“Suzy, I don’t have a weapon.” Helen remarks.\n“Well I guess you’re just going to have to trust me to protect you, because I’m certainly not giving you one.” You say.\n\nDefeated, Helen stops stalling and you both leave and proceed downstairs. (Making sure she’s in front of you of course) The growling, shouting and the gunfire get louder. As you head towards the center of the house, Helen freezes up in fear.\n\n“Helen, move your ass! We don’t have…” you start to say and then suddenly one of the things bursts through the door in front of you and Helen. Helen screams and practically crumples to the floor in front of you in terror. Unfortunately for you the thing in question lunges over Helen and right at you!\n\nYou fall backwards and drop your gun in the process. You manage to keep it from biting your face off by at least pushing your forearms up across its neck. At this close range, it doesn’t look rotten, just very dirty looking and crazed. Still, undead or not, you don’t want to risk getting bit, let alone killed and eaten.\n\nAs you struggle with the creature on the floor, you briefly look desperately over the gun that you dropped and try to reach for it, but it’s just out your grasp. The thing nearly bites you again and tightens its grip on your arms in an attempt to immobilize you. Even your knees to its groin don’t help.\n\nThen out the corner of your eye you see another hand reach for the gun.\n\n“Shit.” You say knowing that this isn’t good.\n\nThen a shot is fired into the side of the thing’s head and blood splatters on you, the floor and partially on the nearby wall.\n\nYou try to pull yourself out from under the corpse, but at this range Helen isn’t going to miss even if you could free yourself quickly.\n\nYou just give her a glaring look of hatred as she points the gun at you even if she does look like she doesn’t want to do it.\n\n“I knew I should’ve killed your treacherous ass.” You say.\n“I’m sorry Suzy, but I just can’t trust you, anymore than you can trust me. I wish this could’ve been different.” Helen responds\n\nBefore you have any more last words, Helen ends your life with several shots to your head.\n",
  "page 118": "Chances are, you’d not only have drag Julie’s ass to Peter’s car, but you’d also have to load up all the bags yourself as well. Since you don’t particularly want to spend much time outside at night, you figure you’ll stay here, rest and figure out exactly what you’re going to do tomorrow.\n\nBesides if you still want to leave, you’ll have time to pack more supplies you can get from here too.\n\nIn the meantime, you still have to search the rest of the house because it’s still entirely possible that it isn’t safe here.\n\nYou exit the garage and check on Julie again. She’s not quite asleep yet, but is heading in that direction. Fortunately you don’t have as many windows in this house and your doors are a lot stronger so you’re confident that if something tries to break in, you’ll hear it and be able to react in time.\n\nYou head upstairs and cautiously search with your pistol drawn. Much like the downstairs though, you find that there isn’t anyone lurking up here. You even manage to find the courage to peek your head into Kelly’s room, but given how messy her usually room is, you don’t know if she’s ever returned here. You get the idea to call her up, but predictably there isn’t any answer. Who knows what’s happened to her.\n\nFinally you end your search of the house by heading to the place where you started from, the basement. Again, not much looks different and fortunately there isn’t anyone down here either. Your own room is about the same as you left it. You shake your head that the though of all the bullshit you went through this week, only to end up back here. Makes you wonder why you bothered.\n\nStill, there is a part of you that realizes that it’s probably best that you did break your habit of hiding out in the basement. Chances are you wouldn’t have developed the courage to do some of the things you are able to do now. You also saved Julie’s life and while she’s certainly been needy and a bit of a wreck during all this, you’re a little glad you don’t have to go through this crisis entirely by yourself.\n\nAfter a bit more perusal of your room, you head back upstairs to secure the ground floor as much as possible. Still not risking turning the lights on, you put chairs in front of the front and back doors. (As well as the one leading to the garage)\n\nYou also move a bookcase in front of some of the windows. It’s not the most fun thing to do in the dark and you bump and bang knees and elbows in the process, but it’s secure enough that you’re confident that if someone does try to get it, they’ll make such a loud noise in the process that you’ll at least wake up first.\n\n“Suzy? What’s going on?” you hear Julie ask in a sleepy tone. You figured she’d be fast asleep by now.\n“Nothing, just securing the area. Nothing for you to worry about, go to sleep.” You say.\n“I’d like to, but I want you with me on this sofa.\n“Julie…(sigh). Look I’m not sure if there’s room for both of us to stretch out on that sofa. I’ll be right here you know. I’ll be in the recliner.”\n“No, I’ll move over as far as I can, and you can squeeze in next to me. Please, I just want your body next to mine. You make me feel so safe.” Julie says.\n\nYou put your hand to your head and start to wonder why you’re becoming more comfortable in even entertaining ideas like this especially with all that’s going on right now.\n\nThough maybe that’s the reason. This is the end of the goddamn world for all you know and at this point you’ve lost everyone that’s been remotely close to you. All of your family is dead (or in Kelly’s case missing). Your boyfriend is also gone. They were all dysfunctional, but it’s what you knew and you still miss it.\n\nSo maybe even as dysfunctional as Julie is, you still feel that need for her companionship because it’s familiar. You have no one else close to you except Julie and she’s going to be “it” if the dark future is any indication.\n\n“Okay, Julie, scoot over.” You say placing your pistol on the table in front of the sofa and start to squeeze in on the edge of it.\n\nThere actually is enough room, it’s snug, but you aren’t quite in danger of falling off the edge. Julie puts one arm and leg over your body almost in an attempt to make sure you don’t fall off, but it’s just her being affectionate as usual.\n\n“Suzy…” she says and she starts to drift off.\n“Yeah?” you say still trying to get comfortable.\n“I love you…”\n“I know Julie. I know.” You answer in a non-committal way.\n\nYou sort of wonder exactly when she began to feel that way. Adulthood? High school? Middle School? Whenever it was, you guess it makes sense since even when you were little you were helping her out of trouble when you could. You probably were the one constant in her life that was genuinely a friend and also not looking to fuck her.\n\nYou still haven’t quite sorted out all your “feelings” yet on this, but you do realize that if you didn’t care somewhat about Julie, you wouldn’t have been making the effort to save her as much as you have.\n\nYou guess at least someone is appreciating you and that’s definitely been a rarity in your life.\n\nYou’re up for a little while longer so you just lie there in the dark going over in your head some of your possible choices of what to do tomorrow. The more you think about it, the more you think that probably leaving is the best solution. You’ll gather some more items from here and load up Peter’s car and tomorrow you and Julie will be heading somewhere else. You still aren’t entirely sure where though.\n\nYou eventually do get sleepy and slowly drift off.\n",
  "page 239": "Matriarch of Madness\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“We’re here mom.” Your son says as your personal armored truck pulls up to the site.\n\nYou look out the window and see the beautiful carnage outside. You can even hear some of the screams and crying from here.\n\n“Ahh, yes. Lovely.” You say.\n“Yeah, dad really did a number on this place after the siege was finally successful.” Your son remarks.\n“Well those rednecks really were asking for it by encroaching on a town that was rightfully ours. Glad to see this white trash haven finally being put to the torch and annihilated. It was a blight on the map even before the nukes hit. Well anyway let’s go, I want to surprise your father.” You remark getting ready to unlock the door.\n“You sure you want to get out? I mean we only just took the place and while the place is in the process of being purged completely, there were still a few of these trailer park bastards hiding in the area. In fact we believe some even ran into the nearby woods and are planning a counter attack. Not that they have any meaningful way of doing so, but still.”\n“Your concern for my safety is sweet Enki, but I didn’t get where I am today by remaining fearful of the possibility of the unknown. Besides, I so rarely get to see your father work anymore and I’d like to give him a nice surprise on his victory. I mean what do you think? Do you think when he sees me, he’ll want to bend me over on the nearest pile of corpses?” you ask and open up the trench coat you’re wearing over your naked body and run your hands briefly down your body\n\nEnki feeling slightly uncomfortable is unsure of what to say.\n\n“Well? I mean three children and not a fucking stretchmark. Years older and not even an inch of cellulite. I’m not just a MILF, I’m the fucking Alpha MILF.” You laugh.\n“Um, yeah you look pretty mom. I dunno, I don’t think about you in that way.” Enki remarks.\n“You’re a poor liar son. I’ve seen the way you look at me sometimes. You think I don’t notice you staring at my chest or those brief glances at my ass on occasion?”\n“No, I…” Enki starts to say before you interrupt him by waving your hand at him.\n\n“It’s okay as long as you know never to touch. Your older brother Anu had to learn that lesson the hard way from your father. Glad cutting off his pinkies didn’t impede his combat abilities though.”\n“Um, yeah. I’d never do that. I…” Enki starts to say then you interrupt him again. This time by putting a finger to his lips.\n“Of course you wouldn’t. You’re the smartest of my children. True, you’re a little on the quiet and introspective side, but then so was I at your age, probably even more so…and as they say it’s the quiet ones you have to look out for.” You say stroking his face.\n\nEnki is speechless while you continue this exercise in severely fucked up mixed messages.\n\n“I love all family and I especially love all my children, however I’ll only admit this to you. You’re my favorite and because you’re my favorite, I’m going to give you something a little more…just a taste if you will…but not a word. It’s a secret and secrets aren’t special when everyone knows.”\n\nYou take the same finger that was on his lips and while closing your eyes and making “mmm” sounds, you slowly insert it into your mouth and then back out again just as slowly.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, Enki is obviously in a mixed state of panic and being incredibly turned on. He probably doesn’t know whether to run or whip his dick out and start shoving your head into his lap. Since doesn’t know what your intentions are he just freezes. You’re totally enjoying the way he has to be having a lot of mental conflict with this.\n\n“Now, I’m going to go find your father. I’m sure you’ve got other things you’ll need to take care of so you needn’t escort me. I’ve got a pistol in my coat pocket anyway, so I’ll be safe. Love you son.” You say with a smile and get out of the car.\n\nYou walk into what remains of the trailer park. You can’t imagine this place looked much different before your family rightfully conquered it. Several of the trailers are overturned, a couple of them are on fire. In fact a couple of its inhabitants are also on fire. Bobby’s younger siblings Aiden and Nadia are casually lighting up a third redneck tied to a stake when you walk over to them. They both respectfully bow when they see you.\n\n“Hello…” Aiden says.\n“Aunt Suzy.” Nadia says.\n“Didn’t expect to…” Aiden adds.\n“…see you here.” Nadia finishes.\n“I’m surprising Bobby, have you seen him?” you ask, trying to speak over the screaming trailer trash burning alive.\n“Our brother…” Aiden says.\n“…we believe…” Nadia says.\n“is on…” Aiden adds.\n“the farside of the trailer park.” They say in unison.\n“Okay then, I’ll let you get back to it.” You say and then they nod and go back to watching their victims burn.\n\nPassing more scenes of violence and waving to a couple of Bobby’s cousins, nephews and nieces you eventually run into your youngest son Nergal who approaches with a young girl over his shoulder. He must have knocked her unconscious because she’s not even struggling. Nergal may be the youngest of your children, but he’s huge and towers over everyone else in your family. He’d be a scary figure to most, but to you, he’s your baby.\n\n“Mom! When did you get here?” Nergal says excitedly.\n“Just now. Have you seen your father?”\n“Yeah, he’s with Anu in that trailer near the edge of that large field over there. I think they’re arguing about a possible plan to make raids on New Security next, but that was boring so I left to go have fun with what’s left of the population here.”\n“Looks like you got a good one son.” You remark and point at the girl over his shoulder.\n“Yeah, this will be fun for awhile, but battle we had before…man it was great! You should’ve seen me mom! I almost racked up as many kills as Anu!”\n“That’s good! Glad to hear it. Tiamat will be most pleased. Well, I’m here to see your father so I’ll talk to you later. Love you son.” You say and leave him to his aggressive dating strategy.\n\nYou see the trailer that you guess Nergal was talking about and approach. Just before you do however, you hear several gunshots come from it. You stop for a moment and then proceed inside. You have nothing to fear. You are a chosen of Tiamat after all.\n\nWhen you enter the trailer, you see Anu standing over Bobby with a pistol in hand. Bobby lies on the floor with dead eyes and a several holes in his body. His own pistol lies near his hand. The funny thing is when you first saw Anu, you briefly thought it was Bobby. Anu looks a lot like his father back in his youthful days, minus his pinkies of course.\n\n“Awww, that’s a shame. I did so want to surprise your father. Looks like the pair of you surprised me instead.” You remark with a frown causing Anu to turn around.\n\n“He gave me no choice mother. He was no longer a fit leader. He told me that raiding New Security would be a bad idea.”\n\nYou walk up to Anu calmly and slap his face. He gives you a look of anger, but does nothing.\n\n“He was right. Raiding New Security is a horrible idea. It’s too large and its defenses are strong. Better to consolidate our current holdings. We’ve got a whole town to play with now.” You say before Anu rudely interrupts.\n“Bullshit! He was just being a coward! He was getting old and weak! He was no longer fit to serve Tiamat!” Anu remarks gruffly.\n\nYou slap your son again causing his anger to rise.\n\n“Your father may have been many things, but never a coward. And true he was getting old, and obviously your reflexes were faster, but he wasn’t weak either and he still was five times smarter than you, but then that isn’t hard to do. We’re not attacking New Security. End of story.” You say dismissively before he grabs your arms forceful and slams you against the wall. You’re hardly intimidated, Anu has always been predictable.\n\n“YOU are NOT in charge here mother! I AM! I have taken what is rightfully mine! I AM the head of this family now!”\n“So, you’ve taken what’s rightfully yours eh? You gonna take me too? Or am I also too old?” you ask with a raise of your eyebrow.\n\nAnu releases you and opens your trench coat revealing your naked body. He stares and marvels at it as if it’s a magical treasure…and for him, it just might be.\n\nHe wastes no time in taking it off you and then starts to take off his belt.\n\n“Get on your knees mother.” He orders which causes you to chuckle.\n“Oh I’ll be getting on my knees, but we’re not doing this the way YOU think. I came here primarily for your father.”\n“The old bastard’s dead in case you haven’t noticed!”\n“And? That’s supposed to stop me? (Sigh) you lack imagination, let me show you…”\n\nAt this point you kneel down near Bobby’s body and start pulling his bloody shirt up. Blood is everywhere, on his clothes, on the floor and still coming from his wounds. You start putting your hands in it and rubbing yourself all over until his blood is covering most of your own body.\n\n“Hmmmm, it’s almost like I’m even closer to him now…” you say starting to finger yourself as Anu stands by watching.\n\nYou then unzip Bobby’s pants and pull out his dead dick. It’s actually hard, which you didn’t expect.\n\n“Ooooh baby…even in death…I can still turn you on. Here, let me prove how much I still love you…” you say and then lower your head down.\n\nWhile you’re on your hands and knees in blood and enjoying the taste your dead husband’s cock, your son Anu shakes off the initial shock and spurs into action.\n\n“Oh fuck this. He will NOT have you in death as well! I’ll show him! I’ll show you both!” Anu exclaims and gets behind you. You temporary stop what you’re doing to turn your head to address your son.\n\n“It’s about time you manned up and joined us. Just try not to bore me.” You remark and go back to what you were doing while Anu hastily rubs the blood of his dead father on his dick to use as makeshift lube.\n\nAnu starts ramming his dick into your supple ass as if he’s trying to hurt you, but thanks to your many interesting love making sessions with Bobby, this isn’t your first rodeo. Plus he’s not even as big as his father so that isn’t an issue either.\n\n“That all you got son? Your father’s a dead man and he’s still turning me on more. Thought you were going to show me who was really in charge? ” you mock.\n“I AM in fucking charge!” he says pulling your hair, which brings a smile to your face.\n“Come on then, make mommy happy!” you demand and Anu attempts to do just that.\n\nSo much for being “in charge” you’ve got him right where you want him. He may be fucking you in the ass, but you’re in charge. Just like you’ve always been and will continue to be. It will be pathetically easy to manipulate Anu into doing what you want.\n\nStill, maybe Anu does have what it takes to be an effective puppet king…at least in the short term, then in time you’ll have Enki replace him…Enki looks more like you anyway.\n\nAs you enjoy your twisted pleasures, you think about how you got to this point as you have in the past a few times before. You think about how easy it was for you to cross line after line after line and how it didn’t even bother you that much to do so.\n\nDid you really get caught up in the murderous rhetoric of being in a sick cult or were you always prone to insanity and all of this was always “you”?\nDoes it even matter at all?\nNo. It doesn’t.\n\nWhat matters is what you can enjoy now in this shitty world and you’ve got that right this minute.\n\n“All hail fucking Tiamat and her glorious chaos!” You laugh maniacally as you climax.\n\nYou may not be Grandma Morningstar, but you’re getting there.\n",
  "page 117": "After pondering it several times over, you think it would be best to just get the hell out of this town. You’re not wasting your time looking for Ben’s hidden shelter, and after finding your brother’s body in here, you don’t think this would be a safe place to stay the night.\n\n“Julie, come on get up, we’re not staying here.” You say jostling her.\n“Mgh, can’t we just rest here? I’m so tired and it’s safe here.” She says.\n“No it isn’t, I just found my dead brother in the fucking garage along with his boyfriend or whoever that guy is…”\n“Holy shit, seriously?” Julie says waking up a bit.\n“Yeah, so let’s get the hell out of here! Come on, grab your bags.”\n\nWith some effort, Julie rouses herself from her drug induced exhaustion and grabs her bags. You get your own and make your way to Peter’s car.\n\nAfter loading it up as quickly as possible, Julie slumps into the passenger seat and you get into the driver’s seat and start it up. So far nothing has come running to attack you, but certainly don’t want to stick around for it happen.\n\nYou make your way towards what you believe is going to be the quickest way out of town, but instead you come across more National Guard barricades. Naturally they tell you to stop, but you don’t and once again you’re making U-Turns under a hail of fire.\n\n“Holy shit Julie! We just got out of being shot at once before, do we really have to do this again?! Can’t we just go back…”\n“JULIE SHUT THE FUCK UP I’M TRYING TO GET US THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!” you scream and serve down a side street. Julie of course starts crying.\n\nYou’re so harried and frustrated that you barely even know where you are. This town might not be the largest, but it seems like a maze when you barely leave the house for years.\n\nYou drive into an area that is literally swarming with the rabid. From the abandoned military vehicles it looks like the National Guard lost its battle here. A crowd of rabid see and hear your car and start immediately running towards you.\n\n“Julie we can’t run them all over! The car will overturn! Turn back! Turn back!” Julie screams, but you don’t listen.\n\nYou slam the gas pedal and go full speed ahead.\n\nYou run over several of them and then their bodies begin to get stuck in the wheels causing the car to skid and spin. You attempt to maintain control, but you fail to do so and the car flips over lands against the wall of a building upside down.\n\nYou’re hurt, but since you had your seatbelt on, you’re still able to move, but unfortunately, you can’t open the door on your side because it’s crushed against a wall.\n\nYou look over to Julie and she’s not moving. In fact she’s half way through the windshield. She’s obviously dead, but that isn’t what concerns you at the moment. What concerns you is the rest of the rabid running over to the car.\n\nAfter a few moments of struggling, the rabid eventually pull you out of the car and sink their teeth into you and gnaw straight through your bones. You die screaming as they eat you alive.\n",
  "page 238": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\"Suzy! You’ve won! You’ve truly overcome all odds! You have not only survived the various uncertain events of this week, but you’ve also thrived! Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give our small town girl some applause and respect for she truly is worthy of it!”\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at…\n\nA bigger bag of dicks.\n\nIt’s even labeled as such. BIGGER BAG OF DICKS in big black lettering so you can’t miss it though that would be impossible since the bag itself is wide enough to take up half of the table and tall enough that you can’t even see the audience from where you’re sitting unless you stand up or look around the bag.\n\nYou just shake your head.\n\n“This joke never gets old with you does it?” you ask.\n\nNo sooner have you said that, when everything disappears and you’re facing Grandma Morningstar in the blasted wasteland again.\n\n“I told you, I don’t have anything to do with your oral fixation scenario dreams, but I will admit it’s a pretty funny joke.”\n“Hardly, but anyway am I finally done with all this nonsense? Am I finally meeting this Misty?” you say.\n“You figure out who it is yet?”\n“Yeah and I can’t believe I didn’t catch it before. Misty…MISS T…Tiamat.” You answer.\n“Yay! Your pretty little blonde head finally got it! Give this woman the BIGGEST BIG OF DICKS as a reward!” Grandma Morningstar cackles to the point where she actually starts wheezing a bit.\n\n“You done yet, you mean old crone?” you ask.\n“Crone is it? Better watch the tone there blondie, you might be officially family now, but don’t think I’m going to put up with your sass. Even in this form I could severely fuck you up, you best remember that.” Grandma Morningstar warns.\n“What…what are you exactly anyway? A ghost? A demon?”\n“Does it matter? Tiamat blessed me with this existence for my dedication to chaos and if you continue to prove yourself worthy like you have been doing then when that inevitable day comes that you shuffle off your mortal coil you might be just as blessed as I am. I doubt it though. You’ll probably just rot in the ground.”\n“Probably right since I’m not exactly the most religious person.”\n“Bah, Tiamat doesn’t really care about mindless ritualistic worship. She is the goddess of chaos so who knows what she really likes at any given time?”\n“Interesting, so am I meeting her now?”\n“Uh, no. Tiamat is sort of busy now or maybe she just doesn’t care, hard to tell sometimes…”\n“What?! I thought you said I was meeting her now.”\n“I actually never did, but cheer up. Given that you just admitted to not being a religious sort you can’t be too disappointed in not meeting her directly.”\n“Well…no, but that’s not the point. I sort of feel like there was a build up and by not meeting her now is an anti-climax.”\n“Ah, but if you really think about it, your journey has only just begun! Perhaps there is more build up for the ultimate climax later! There is nothing to say you won’t meet her in the future, but will it be on good terms or bad? Eh? Eh? One never knows!”\n“Great, more shit to worry about.”\n\nGrandma Morningstar steps forward and touches you on the shoulder.\n\n“Don’t despair blondie, you’ll do fine. Besides, I like you.” She says and then pinches your cheek before giving you a couple gentle taps to the face like some sort of mafia godfather figure from the movies.\n\nAs you rub your face, Grandma Morningstar waves goodbye to you, disappears and everything around you gets dark.\n\nAnd you wake up.\n\nYou’re a little surprised since you have a body right next to you, but you quickly calm down when you realize its Bobby. He’s partially under the blankets with you and puts down a book he was reading.\n\n“You okay? You seem a little jumpy. Bad dream?” he asks.\n“Eh…better than others I’ve had this week. We actually need to have a talk about them…when we…” you then realize if Bobby is here then he’s obviously seen Helen.\n\nYou look over to your left and see that Helen’s body is no longer there and then you look over at Bobby.\n\n“…I meant to tell you about that…” you say.\n“No need. I can sort of guess what happened. So I take it Diana wasn’t lying to me after all?”\n“Not completely, Helen was the initial mastermind, but Diana was definitely still going to kill me when the opportunity presented itself. Things didn’t quite work out as planned as you can tell.”\n“Hm. Still can’t believe it. Helen was always so quiet and docile.”\n“Well, you know what they say about the quiet ones. They’re the most dangerous.” You remark.\n“Guess you know something about that.” Bobby says.\n“Yeah…I guess I do.” You say cuddling up next to him.\n\nIt’s true. You used to be a shut in wallflower at one time. That meek girl that used to hide out in the basement is long gone after this week’s events.\n\n“I see you’re still wearing your dress as well as your ring.”\n“Oh. Yeah, too tired to change and the ring…well I really like it.” You say caressing it a bit.\n“That’s good. I’m glad.”\n“So…what are you doing up here anyway? Thought you were on watch duty.” You ask.\n“I was, and as usual you’ve slept most of the day again. It’s the middle of the afternoon. I’m up here because I was going to get a bit of rest before catching some more sleep due to being up all night. Plus I figure the rest of the family can do the majority of grunt work for a change without me having to hoover over them. Besides, I wanted to spend time with my wife and be the first thing she sees when she wakes up. I know that hasn’t been a real common thing since you got here.”\n“I’ll say. I’m glad you’re here too since we haven’t had a chance to consummate the marriage and we really need to do that…like right now.” You say and your hand starts groping at Bobby’s crotch.\n\n“You aren’t THAT tired.” You remark after feeling his dick status.\n“Well not now I’m not.” Bobby says and then embraces you.\n\nYou feel Bobby plunge into like you have so many times before, but this time it almost feels slightly different because you’re now married to this man. Something about that makes it almost feel more…”special”.\n\nYou didn’t really think you’d ever really feel that way over some silly ritual that joins people supposedly for life, but its probably more of the fact that you know for certain that Bobby is your soul mate.\n\nDuring the love making session, you begin to take on a more aggressive role and eventually get Bobby so he’s under you and continue riding him. It’s a bit different than the norm since he’s usually the dominant one ramming it into you, but he isn’t enjoying it any less.\n\nAnd then near the point of climax that’s when it happens. A flash of bright light briefly covers the windows and a loud noise is heard in the distance.\n\n“Shit what the hell was that?” Bobby asks sitting up a bit.\n“I dunno. I had my eyes closed and I just caught the tail end of the flash. Glad I didn’t have them all the way open.” You remark rubbing your eyes a bit.\n“Wait a minute…I think I know…” Bobby says and then motions for you to get off of him.\n\nHe walks over to the window and you follow close behind.\n\nIn the distance to the west, you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn’t a big one, but you’re still a little concerned if you’re in some sort of fallout radius.\n\n“So…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“Looks like. (Sigh) Shit.” Bobby says.\n“What’s wrong? I thought we were prepared for this sort of thing.”\n“Oh we are. I’m not even worried about that, it’s just I wanted to spend the day relaxing with you. Now? Well I think you know I’m going to have to go and direct everyone. You know at least one of my family, if not all of them are going to come running up here asking what to do.”\n“Yeah, well such is the burden of being a leader.”\n“Indeed. Guess I better get down there. Are you coming?”\n“Of course my love. We’re in this together.”\n\nYou and Bobby get dressed and prepare yourselves for the new world that’s undoubtedly coming soon confident in the fact that whatever its going to throw at you, you’ll do it together.\n",
  "page 88": "The whole town has gone to shit and it’s either going to get completely obliterated by the government or its going to get overrun by those things or both. In any case, your best bet would be to put as much distance between you and this god-forsaken town.\n\n“As much as I’d like to, I can’t go home again. So if you know someplace we can go that’s safe, I’m game if you are.” You say.\n“Well I can think of a few isolated places I’ve been through in my travels before I came to this town. Dunno, if they’re safe right now, but it’s worth a shot. Gonna be a long drive though and I need to go east so hopefully that way is going to be clear.” Johnny says and pulls out of the driveway.\n\nYou pass by a few soldiers dragging a few more bodies and placing them in a large pile outside one of the homes in this area. Another large pile of bodies is burning outside yet another home. Nobody tries to flag you down or anything though, you’re guessing that between the dark, the uniforms and the jeep, if anyone is actually paying attention to you driving through, they probably think you’re just more soldiers patrolling around. It isn’t like this is most stable of situations right now.\n\nYou continue drive and you go through another area where the National Guard has a presence. Again, you have no problems for the most part. However you then start hitting areas that are still suffering from conflict and in those cases, pretty severely. This is where some soldiers notice you a lot more and try to call out to you, presumably for help.\n\nIn one case, you see two soldiers ragged and bloody running desperately from several of those rabid people. They cry out for you to stop, but naturally you and Johnny just keep driving. You hear some faint curses and screams as you put distance between you and the unfortunate soldiers.\n\nYou eventually drive through areas that have been completely overrun by rabid. In fact you find that the military doesn’t actually have that much control at all over your town and that there are far more of the rabid roaming around either chasing down normal people or attempting to break into houses.\n\nHowever, you’re in an area now that’s thick enough with them that some of them are actually attacking the jeep or at least managing to bang on it a couple times before you out distance them. Johnny runs over a few of them that get directly in the way. They’re starting to get too close for you at this point.\n\n“Holy shit, this is just getting worse. Maybe we should go in another direction.” You say.\n“We can make it, we’re almost out of town.” Johnny says.\n\nYou aren’t quite as confident as Johnny who now seems to be going out of his way to mow down rabid in the jeep. In fact he’s got a big grin on his face as he smashes into another and turning the windshield wipers on.\n\n“Johnny, would you fucking stop that!? We can’t run over everyone one of these things! It’s going to damage the jeep!”\n“Relax! It’s a military jeep, these things are built to last! Besides this is kinda fun. When else do you get the chance to just run over people?” Johnny giggles.\n\nJohnny’s obvious display of psychopathy might be more worrying, if you weren’t more concerned with the bigger threat of a very large group of rabid up ahead.\n\n“Johnny! You can’t go through that group it’s too fucking big! Turn around!” you shout.\n“Fuck that, we gotta go that way and I don’t give a shit how many of those freaks I have to splatter! Let’s do this!” Johnny shouts and slams on the gas.\n\nYou close your eyes as the jeep speeds ahead while Johnny is laughing the entire time. He’s really getting off on this.\n\nJohnny manages to run over several of them, but there are just too many, it doesn’t help there is also debris in the road left from the fighting that was going on here before.\n\nA tire gets popped, a body gets stuck under another wheel. The jeep begins to skid and spin. Johnny tries to maintain control, but fails to do so and the jeep flips over landing upside down.\n\nYou’re hurt, but since you had your seatbelt on, you’re still able to move. You look over to Johnny and he’s not moving. In fact he’s half way through the windshield. He’s obviously dead, but that isn’t what concerns you at the moment. What concerns you is the rest of the rabid running over to the jeep.\n\nYou struggle with your belt and manage to crawl out of the jeep only to be quickly nabbed by the rabid. They sink their teeth into you and gnaw straight through your bones. You die screaming as they eat you alive.\n",
  "page 87": "It might be wishful thinking on your part, but you desire to be able to go home and stay there is a lot stronger than trying to find some place new. In fact it seems like every time you try something new, it turns into a clusterfuck.\n\n“I want to go home and give it one more chance. If it turns out staying there isn’t a viable option, then I suppose we can leave town.” You say.\n“Okay, but you’ll have to give me directions.” Johnny says and starts pulling out of the driveway.\n\nYou pass by a few soldiers dragging a few more bodies and placing them in a large pile outside one of the homes in this area. Another large pile of bodies is burning outside yet another home. Nobody tries to flag you down or anything though, you’re guessing that between the dark, the uniforms and the jeep, if anyone is actually paying attention to you driving through, they probably think you’re just more soldiers patrolling around.

Most of them don’t attempt to attack you, or if they do, you just continue driving fast enough that they don’t get the chance.\n\nBy the time you get to your own house, your neighborhood is eerily quiet. There are definitely signs of past conflict all over the place, but there is nobody on the streets and most homes are not lit either. (Though you do see broken doors and windows on a lot of them) Fortunately your own house doesn’t look damaged (At least not from the front)\n\nYou half expect to get swarmed by crazies as soon as you park in front of your house, but fortunately that isn’t the case and you manage get in the house as quickly as possible.\n\n“Can’t see shit, but I’m sort of afraid to turn on a light.” You remark.\n“I know what you mean. Wouldn’t want to attract those things. I got a small flashlight on this rifle. It shouldn’t be too noticeable from the outside. So what’s the deal with this shelter your brother built?” Johhny says turning on the flashlight and briefly shining it around the room and the nearby room.\n“I don’t know yet. I mean all I know is the entrance is hidden and that Peter was looking for it. In fact, I’m wondering if he already found it and locked himself up in it. Seems like he would’ve heard us.”\n“We haven’t been that noisy. Besides, maybe he thinks we’re intruders and is laying in wait to ambush us.”\n“Possibly. I’d call out his name, but again, I don’t want to make more noise…ah to hell with it. PETER?! Are you here?!” you said in a raised voice, trying not to shout too loudly.\n\nThere is no answer.\n\n“He could be down in the basement or upstairs.” Johnny says.\n“Maybe, I still think he would’ve heard me though…let’s go check his room. If he did find out something about the shelter, maybe there will at least be a clue there.” You say.\n“Where’s his room?”\n“The connected garage. It’s near the kitchen up ahead.”\n\nYou cautiously move about in the dark with Johnny taking the lead. You’re holding on to your pistol the whole time being paranoid about something attacking you in the darkness. Johnny slowly opens the door to the garage and shines his light inside…\n\nYou find Peter and another unknown man both not quite entirely dressed, but that isn’t the disturbing part. The fact that they’re both dead is the disturbing part.\n\n“Holy shit, that’s Peter.” You say.\n“Who’s the other guy?” Johnny asks.\n“Dunno. Probably a client or boyfriend or something. He said he was with someone when I spoke earlier today with him.”\n“Hmm, looks like there was a struggle. This place is obviously a mess.” Johnny says shining the light all over the room.\n\nHe shines the light on Peter and the other man and then gets a closer look.\n\n“Hmm, looks like they both suffered quite a bit of blunt trauma before their necks got snapped. It certainly wasn’t those rabid people that did this. I’d wager if it was, they’d have chunks bitten out of them. Bandits perhaps, but this house doesn’t look ransacked.”\n\nYou stand there in silence as Johnny goes on about who could’ve possibly done this.\n\n“Suzy? You okay?” Johnny asks.\n“Huh? Yeah. It’s just…well sort of weird. I was pissed at Peter for the bullshit he said on the phone. Seeing him dead like this…is well…I dunno. I feel like I should feel something, but I don’t. Maybe I’m becoming desensitized or something.”\n“Well, like you said, he was an asshole to you earlier.”\n“Yeah, he was. In fact I think part of the reason why I came here was the hope that he hadn’t locked himself inside the shelter yet, so I could yell at him in person and maybe even kick his ass. (Sigh) Guess that isn’t necessary anymore. Also don’t know if he actually found the shelter or not and now I’m paranoid that whoever killed him is still in this fucking house.”\n“We can find out the latter pretty quickly I should think, we can just make a quick search. As for the former, well that’s up to you really.”\n\nIt’s the middle of the night, you’re in a town full of trigger happy military and cannibalistic crazies, you’ve just found your brother and his lover dead in the garage, you’re hanging around a guy who is unhealthily obsessed with you and to top it all of, you’re getting tired.\n\nAt this point you don’t want to risk anymore travelling.\n\n“Well, let’s do what you said and check the house out. If everything is safe, let’s just camp here for the rest of the night and start looking for the shelter tomorrow with fresh eyes.” You say.\n“As you wish.” Johnny answers.\n\nFirst thing you do is finish checking out the ground floor. Everything turns out okay and fairly untouched. Even the backyard doesn’t have any nasty unwanted lurkers in it either. (As added protection you and Johnny shove a few chairs in front of the back and front doors just in case any DO show up)\n\nYou head upstairs and cautiously search with Johnny. Much like the downstairs though, you find that there isn’t anyone lurking up here. You even manage to find the courage to peek your head into Kelly’s room, but given how messy her usually room is, you don’t know if she’s ever returned here. Who knows what’s happened to her.\n\nFinally you end your search of the house by heading to the place where you started from, the basement. Again, not much looks different and fortunately there isn’t anyone down here either. Not worrying about someone seeing a light source down here you turn the lights on and find your own room is about the same as you left it. You shake your head that the though of all the bullshit you went through this week, only to end up back here. Makes you wonder why you bothered.\n\n“So…this is where you lived huh?” Johnny asks.\n“Yep. This was my lot in life. It wasn’t much, but it was mine. I was happy here you know? (Sigh) If only things never changed…Hm. Just realized you’re the first person other than myself that’s been in here in a long time.” You say.\n“What about your boyfriend?” Johnny asks.\n“Bobby? Not as much as you might think. We actually hung out upstairs when nobody else was really around or over his house as unpleasant as that could be at times. Honestly I sort of preferred that nobody come in here except me. This was my haven from the outside world and wanted to maintain that illusion as much as possible. Funny, but even with all the chaos going on out there, I still feel very safe here. Anyway, I guess nobody is lurking in the house.”\n“Guess not. Either that or they’re very sneaky. So are you going to be sleeping down here then?”\n“I believe I will. I figure even if we can’t find the shelter tomorrow, I will have at least gotten to sleep one last time in my own room before we leave.”\n“Don’t worry, we’ll find it. In fact maybe I’ll do a little searching while you’re resting.”\n“Heh, well good luck with that. I know it seems like an easy task since the backyard is only so big, but somehow Ben managed to hide it pretty well. Only his son Tommy used to consistently know where it was located and moved. Besides, I wouldn’t want you to suddenly drawing a pack of those rabid things due to you shining a flashlight around outside. Even if there is a privacy fence around the back.”\n“Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.”\n“Yes. Yes, I imagine you would be…Johnny…you weren’t in the military yourself at one time were you?”\n“Nah. Following orders, regimented life, not really my thing. Had enough of that growing up with my mom. Why?”\n“Just wondering. Due to all the shit that’s been going on, we also haven’t had much time to talk. I still don’t know that much about you.”\n“Heh, well you know. Like I mentioned a few times, I’ve been a bit of a drifter. Nothing really exciting though, it’s just the way things have turned out for me.”\n\nJohnny starts shifting his body a bit. He’s trying not to look nervous about you asking deeper questions about his past, but you can tell by now when he’s being evasive.\n\n“Okay, so I’m gonna leave you to your haven as you called it. If anything urgent comes up I’ll be sure to let you know.” Johnny says.\n\nJohnny turns and starts to leave then he stops to turn back to you.\n\n“You know I love you right?” he says.\n“I… know Johnny…and we’ll talk about that tomorrow as well.”\n\nJohnny doesn’t reply, he just turns around and heads upstairs.\n\nWell barring any unforeseen problems you’ve got two big issues to tackle tomorrow. The shelter location and Johnny.\n\nBut those are issues to deal with tomorrow. Right now you’re going to pretend that none of the shit that’s currently happening is actually happening and enjoy your haven, if only tonight.\n",
  "page 82": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou are suddenly awakened by the sound of your phone.\n\nYou don’t think, you don’t look, you just instinctively grab it and answer.\n\n“Hello?” you answer still slightly groggy.\n“Suzy? It’s Peter.”\n“Peter?” you say a little surprised he returned your call as well still shaking the cobwebs out from coming out of your sleep.\n“Yeah, it’s me. You called me yesterday, but I was busy with, well a bunch of shit really. It’s sort of crazy around here, the National Guard is shooting people in the street…well at least I think they’re still people.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I’m saying that I’ve been seeing some weird shit. Like several people running around trying to bite other people.”\n“Wait…what? You mean literally trying to bite people?”\n“Yes, I mean bite, as in I saw one guy that lived down the street from us chase another neighbor and start chewing on him like he was out of a goddamn zombie movie!”\n“…are you saying this guy was a zombie?”\n“Look I don’t know. I mean maybe he was just rabid or something, but this wasn’t an isolated incident. Maybe it’s a disease outbreak, or bio-weapon accident or something. I mean that would explain why the National Guard is here. I’m just glad they or any of those freaks haven’t beat down the door to this house yet, but I’m not taking any chances that’s why I’ve been trying to find Ben’s shelter.”\n“Ben’s shelter?”\n“Yeah, you know the one he was always working on and changing the fucking entrance all the time on? I figure it’s probably still well stocked and I intend on riding this whole fucked up situation in the safety of that thing until everything is back to normal. We haven’t had much luck in finding it though…”\n“We? Is Kelly there helping you?”\n“Kelly? Nah, I haven’t seen that Amazon cunt since she left for work on Monday night. Don’t know where she is. I’m here with one of my…clients. Anyway how are you and Donna?”\n“I don’t know where Donna is. She left Julie’s on Monday night and never came back, then Julie left on fucking Tuesday night and SHE never came back. Then on Wednesday…(sniff)…”\n\nYou begin to feel a wave of emotion hit you as the thought of what happened yesterday catch up to you again.\n\n“Suzy?” Peter asks.\n“(Sob) I think…I think I’m gonna be in a lot of trouble Peter…(Sob) Something terrible happened…”\n\nYou can’t continue and you begin to cry.\n\n“Hey… look I…” Peter is unsure of what to say for a moment and then he continues.\n\n“Look, I don’t know what’s going on over there, but I really need to let you go. I was actually hesitant to call you since I don’t think it’s a good idea to talk on the phone long right now anyway. I mean who knows if the government is listening…so…”\n\nYou stop crying immediately and just stare at your phone in disbelief.\n\n“Wait, wait, wait. Just fucking wait a minute. Granted we’ve never been close Peter, but I have been genuinely concerned about you as soon as the National Guard rolled up in this town. Why the hell do you think I called? I’m obviously distressed about my current situation and you don’t even offer a sympathetic ear? After all the fucking times you’ve stolen my clothes? After all the goddamn times I had to put up with your old loser junkie friend Kevin perving on me when you thought you were some sort of film maker? You can’t even make the fucking effort to even PRETEND to care a little? You can’t even do THAT for me?” you shout.\n“Suzy, what the fuck do you want me to do? You’re over there and I’m over here. I mean I got my own shit to worry about. And you how this family operates, when the shit goes down, you fucking look out for yourself first.” Peter says.\n“I’m not asking you to jump in your car and save me, I just wanted a little…fuck it…you know what just fuck you Peter!” you shout and hang up\n\n“FUCK YOU!” you shout and throw your phone against the wall just as Johnny comes walking in.\n“I heard you shouting, what’s going on?” he asks.\n\n“My fucking brother is a goddamn selfish bastard that’s what’s going on! I’m fucking nervous, I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid. And what does he do? Does he even make an effort to console me in any way? No of course not he worries about himself. It’s what my family does, out for number one as usual. Fuck all of them, I don’t even care what happens to ANY of them any more!” say sobbing.\n\nJohhny approaches you, but still keeps a respectable distance.\n\n“Suzy, you don’t need to worry about them any more. They aren’t even worth getting mad about okay? Look I’m here and I’ll take care of everything. Speaking of which, that thing yesterday….”\n\nYou wipe your eyes and try to compose yourself.\n\n“I…I don’t want to hear anymore about it… I just don’t…”\n“I understand. I understand. I just wanted you to know that it’s all been taken care of.”\n“Yeah, until they send someone to find out what happened to him.” You say.\n\nJohnny now steps in a bit closer.\n\n“Well, they haven’t yet and I doubt if they’re going to right now. You’ve been asleep for most of the day and you’re probably not aware, but there’s been some problems going on around the neighborhood I guess. In fact I actually went upstairs to check from one of the windows to get a better view and I saw them shoot a couple people a few houses down. Well I assume they were still people on some level, but they certainly weren’t acting right. Like they were rabid or something. One got killed by multiple chest shots though so I think we can at least assume they aren’t the living dead.”\n“Hrm. Peter mentioned something like that happening in my neighborhood. He thinks it’s a disease or biological weapon.”\n“Well he might be right on that somewhat. Seems like the Guardsmen would be equipped with gasmasks or something if it was something like though. I dunno. Anyway, as I was saying for all they know they might think that Zoll guy and his soldier buddy got bushwacked by one of those things yesterday. Besides, he went to several houses, it’s not like they’re automatically going to know it was us.”\n\nJohnny’s attempts at making you feel better don’t really work, since it just replaces one concern of getting executed by the military for murder for another concern of getting possibly infected by whatever disease is turning people into “zombies.”\n\nStill, he’s the only one trying and actually here for you, and that’s the sad part.\n\n“Johnny, is that a uniform you’re wearing?” you say noticing he’s changed his clothes.\n“Yeah. They’re from that poor soldier that broke his neck on the stairs. I know it’s a bit ghoulish, but my own clothes were shall I say, very… soiled after taking care of that business. Fortunately, the uniform seems to be a perfect fit. I was also thinking maybe it could also be a disguise in case we need to get the hell out of here.” Johnny remarks.\n“Hm, could work, but I don’t have a uniform.” You say.\n“I could always say you’re a prisoner or survivor I found. In any case it might be...”\n\nBefore Johnny can finish, he’s interrupted by the breaking of glass coming from the kitchen followed by snarling and grunting.\n\n“Shit!” Johnny exclaims and runs out of your room. You’re not quite as eager to run towards the sound of danger, at least not until you grab the pistol out of the desk first.\n\nYou haven’t gotten a few steps out of your room and you hear the sounds of a multiple shots being fired, followed by more glass breaking and an awful sound of anguish.\n\nYou enter the kitchen and see Johnny standing there with an assault rifle pointed at the bullet hole ridden back door. Must be the same rifle the soldier had. He turns around.\n\n“It was one of those things. More of them must be wandering this way… where did that pistol come from?” Johnny asks.\n“It was in a desk. So you think more of those things are coming?”\n“I don’t really know, just a hunch, but the gunfire outside doesn’t sound like it’s letting up. We could easily barricade ourselves in here, but who knows how long this thing is going to last.”\n“Do you think we could make it out of here ?”\n“I believe we could, but it does sound like a warzone out there right now.”\n“Well I hope my sister has another set of car keys because that’s the only vehicle out there right now.” You say.\n“Hmm, well even if we did, I’m fairly certain as soon as we drove out in it, we’d be getting fired upon on. Even if we made it, there’s going to be more military areas to drive through. Nevermind the fact that your sister’s car isn’t exactly sturdy looking enough to survive such an attack, there is also always the possibility of a bunch of those things gathering together to overturn the vehicle.”\n“So are you saying we should go by foot?” you ask.\n“Heh, if it were just me, I might do that, but since your safety is a priority to me, I feel like we’d have a better chance however if I stole one of those military jeeps I’ve seen patrolling around.” Johnny replies.\n“Are you nuts? How the hell are we supposed to get one of those?”\n“Not we, me. I believe I could steal one. I have to admit I’m a little tired though. Still haven’t had a lot of sleeps, especially with… well you know. If I could just catch a little rest, I’d probably be able to do it better under the cover of the night.”\n\nThe fact that Johnny seems so sure that he can just steal a military vehicle is a little scary. Did he also serve in the military or something? He’s never said. Come to think of it, he’s still never revealed too much about himself. In any case that isn’t quite your primary concern right now.\n\n“Well if you really believe you can steal a jeep, I guess that’s our best shot.” You say.\n“Well we still should pack some bags with useful supplies first. I’ll get some things from the basement since I’m pretty sure I saw quite few things down there. You can check this floor and check the upstairs.”\n\nJohnny heads back into the basement and you check upstairs first. You search Donna’s room and you do find some keys. You’re fairly sure that they are probably a spare set to Donna’s car. After grabbing the practical pharmacy from the bathroom (Julie and Donna sure didn’t reserve their drugs to just the illegal kind) you return to your own room and start repacking some of your clothes and some other personal items. A quick trip to the kitchen finds you a few bags of snacks and batteries. (And you looking over your shoulder constantly thinking that something is going to try to break in through the backdoor again)\n\nJohnny eventually comes up from the basement with an old looking bag of stuff. He’s looking really tired now.\n\n“Johnny are you going to be okay to do this? I mean I just found Donna’s car keys. We could leave in that and I’d drive.” you ask.\n“No, our best chance is the jeep. We’ll be riddled with bullets in that car. I’ll be fine. Just need a few hours of shuteye. After that, I’ll be ready to go. I guess I’ll sleep on the sofa in the living room.” Johnny says while walking off towards the living room with the bag and rifle.\n\n“Well I suppose we should wait before leaving anyway, I’d rather have you alert while we’re on the road. Hold on a moment you look a little wobbly.” You say and help him the rest of the way, which isn’t far of course, but you feel like it’s a nice gesture. Johnny certainly thinks so…but then he tends to think everything you do is wonderful.\n\n“Shit, I’m so tired. Even that gunfire going on isn’t going to keep me awake.” Johnny says, flopping down on the couch.\n“Well, I’ll be awake, so even if something unexpected happens and you’re still snoozing, I can wake you up.”\n“Thank you.” Johnny says looking up at you. He almost reaches his hand out to touch your face, but quickly stops himself. “I’m sorry that you had to call me your boyfriend yesterday.”\n“What?” You ask.\n“Yesterday, when you tried to lie to Mr. Zoll. You said I was your boyfriend. I know you were just saying that.” Johnny says as he starts to close his eyes.\n“You don’t worry about that right now. Just rest like you should have been able to yesterday.”\n“Okay…God…you’re so perfect. You’re so much better than me. I’ve done a lot of bad things Suzy.”\n“I think after yesterday we’ve both done a lot of bad things.” You reply.\n“No…I’ve…” Johnny starts to say, but then he trails off.\n\nLeaving Johnny to sleep, you stay in the living room if only because you’re a bit nervous to be by yourself right now. You turn the TV on and keep it on low, but as usual nothing of importance is on save for Ground Zero infomercials.\n\nLacking anything better to do (Other than being on edge a bit) you start to contemplate that if Johnny is successful WHERE you should go. You don’t really have any good ideas either. You’ve never been anywhere in your life, so why would you have any ideas on where to go now? And given how fucked up everything is right now, where would it even be safe to go?\n\nNo, the only place you’ve ever felt safe and at home is your basement. How you wish you could return. Then as you watch the GZ salesman obnoxiously go on about their product, it hits you… why shouldn’t you return?\n\nIt’s a pleasant thought, but who knows if Peter already found the hidden entrance to the shelter yet. He might very well be already be enjoying the shelter with his boyfriend or whoever he’s got over there. You’re fairly certain if that’s the case, he isn’t going to let you in to share it. That was clear when you spoke to him on the phone.\n\nSo where does that leave you? Leaving town to parts unknown? If that’s the case, you imagine you’ll have to leave that in Johnny’s hands since he’s mentioned he’s drifted from place to place and probably knows more about possible locations to go to in an emergency than you do.\n\nOn top of all this, you still aren’t quite sure what to do with Johnny. He’s definitely gone a long way in trying to prove himself to you. He has possibly saved your life and is obviously willing to risk his for you. The only other person who has done that was Bobby. In some ways Johnny sort of reminds you of Bobby…and that’s also another reason why you continue to be leery of him.\n\nOther than his stalker behavior since you’ve met him, you’ve already come to the conclusion that Johnny probably has some sort of shady history. When you saw him finishing off Mr. Zoll…well it wasn’t exactly a normal reaction. He didn’t just react out of a panic like you did when you pushed Zoll down the stairs, Johnny got frothing mad. An anger you’ve never seen him display so outwardly before.\n\nBetween that and his mumblings of “doing bad things” and you’re inclined to believe that whatever his past might be, that Johnny HAS killed before.\n\nAnd probably the more fucked up thing is that it doesn’t exactly bother you, or rather it doesn’t bother you like it should a normal person. Bobby used to kill people on a regular basis and while it took a little time for you to build complete trust in him, you did it and you had a relationship out of it. (And the funniest thing is that it didn’t even end in bloodshed)\n\nThe question is, do you want to possibly put yourself through it all again? The unstable nature? The paranoia of wondering is he ever going to hurt you? Even the “normal” part of wondering if you’re just going to just eventually break up is a concern for you. Part of you still is upset about Bobby after all.\n\nYou must have a thing for murderers at this point, because it’s the only explanation to why you’re contemplating all this. Maybe that whole incident with your Uncle Ed fucked you up even more than you realized.\n\nYou do have Donna’s car keys. You could just leave now while Johnny sleeps.\n",
  "page 81": "Seeing that Mr. Zoll is threatening you and going for something in his pocket you do the only thing that you can think of that comes to mind.\n\nYou shove him as hard as you can towards the stairs. With one hand in his suit pocket he can’t quite catch his balance and he goes tumbling backwards down the steps.\n\nJohnny just manages to get out of the way of Mr. Zoll’s tumbling body and soon it hits the bottom just like his buddy did. Mr. Zoll however starts groaning in pain indicating that he’s only hurt. He isn’t dead…well at least not yet.\n\nStill in shock from what you have done, you stand motionless as you see Johnny take advantage of Zoll’s prone condition and begins stomping on his head. Several times. Then he grabs the soldier’s rifle and begins smashing the butt of it into Zoll’s face. You’re not right up front for this gruesome display; you can still see the blood flying from where you’re standing.\n\n“Die! Die motherfucker! Fucking piece of shit!” Johnny starts muttering as he continues to destroy Zoll’s skull structure.\n\nAfter a few seconds of watching this, you snap out of it.\n\n“Johnny! Stop! He’s dead! He’s dead…(sob) he’s…dead…” you say and break down. You feel sick and run into your bathroom. You cough and vomit into the toilet, but it isn’t so much your contributing to Mr. Zoll’s death or watching it unfold, it’s mainly because you’re sick with worry right now about the repercussions of such actions.\n\n“Oh my god…oh god…what did I do…” you say in between heaving and crying.\n\nAt this point Johnny has come up from upstairs to check on you. As you look over from hovering over the toilet, you see him standing before you in your bathroom doorway and blood on his clothes.\n\n“Suzy…Suzy…calm yourself. You did what you had to do. The guy didn’t give you much of a choice. I checked his pocket and he was definitely packing a pistol in it. If you hadn’t pushed him, he might’ve very well shot you and me both.” Johnny says in an attempt to console you, but it’s not working very well.\n\n“They…they’re going to send more people to look for him…they’re going to find out…we can’t even run. There’s military everywhere!” you say before heaving some more, but you’ve nothing left. You’re just shaking.\n\nJohnny steps towards you.\n\n“Suzy. Suzy. We’re going to be fine. Remember WE didn’t do anything wrong here. These assholes came invading our space and then acted in a threatening manner even after we both tried to be accommodating to them.”\n\nYou stand before Johnny who now has grabbed a small washcloth and is approaching you with it. You just continue to tremble.\n\n“Suzy. Listen to me. I can clean up the mess in the basement. I’ll make it so nobody will ever know. Okay? If more weekend warriors show up at our door asking about their boss or whoever that dickhead was to them, we’ll just say he left and that they can search the damn house if they want. They won’t find his body. They won’t find ANY body. Trust me on that.”\n\nJohnny dabs the sides of your mouth with the washcloth. You at him with a mixture of fear and hopefulness. All you can think about right now is how you wish all of this would go away.\n\n“Can…can you really make all this go away?” you ask.\n“Yes, I can. And in the event that we have to run, we DO have that option. We aren’t prisoners here despite what the government wants us to think. We’re free to go anywhere we wish.”\n“I…I want to go home…” you say.\n“Well, maybe that’s where we’ll go then.”\n\nJohnny now holds both of your hand in his and looks into your eyes.\n\n“Suzy. I love you and I’ll never let any harm come to you. If the worst comes to worst, I’ll take all the blame for what happened today. I don’t want you to worry about this any more. You’ve been brave enough for one day.”\n\nHis eyes they’re so piercing right now. They give off an almost commanding stare. His voice is so soothing though and it’s actually making you feel slightly at ease.\n\nThe combination of you having a minor breakdown and the stress of all that’s going on…well it’s all enough for you to just accept Johnny’s willingness to step up and solve all your troubles like some sort of white knight.\n\nAt least right now at any rate.\n\n“Come on, let’s get you to your bed. You need to rest.” Johnny says and starts to guide you back to your room. You don’t resist. You just go with it. Johnny is a perfect gentleman though; he doesn’t attempt to touch you in any manner that might be inappropriate.\n\nAs you lay down the bed, you allow yourself to start giving into the wave of sleep that’s hitting you from all the mental exhaustion you’re going through.\n\n“Okay, Suzy, I’m going to get to work. Now I’ll close your door and leave you be, but if you need anything at all, just call me of course. Just don’t get up, you don’t need to put yourself through anymore trouble.”\n\nYou nod at Johnny’s remark as you start to close your eyes. It’s hard to believe that not too long ago he was the one exhausted and you were still relatively lively. You have no idea where he gets his energy from.\n\nJust as Johnny is about to leave. You call out.\n\n“Johnny?”\n“Yes, Suzy?”\n“Thank you.”\n\nYour eyes are still closed so you don’t see Johnny smile at you before exiting your room.\n",
  "page 84": "You’re still not quite sure if any of this is going to lead anywhere, but fucked up or not, Johnny’s still been there for you. To abandon him without even an explanation is just something you’re not willing to do.\n\nBesides, if you’re right about Johnny’s past, having someone like that around might be necessary given how crazy things are right now. Other than pushing someone down the stairs out of panic, it isn’t like you’re a fighter.\n\nLooking a nearby clock on the wall, you figure it’ll be getting dark in a few hours. Johnny didn’t tell you when to wake him, but you figure you should give him a few extra hours after it goes dark if only so he’ll be more rested. Then you’ll try to convince him to just leave in Donna’s car again since you still think it would be safer than trying to steal a military jeep.\n\nStill feeling a little uncomfortable about the back door windows now being broken and thus your safety more compromised, you head back into the kitchen to fix the problem. As you get close to the backdoor, you briefly see the thing still lying dead with several holes in its body and head on the back porch. Looks human, but even dead it does look a bit feral.\n\nWith great effort you manage to push the refrigerator in front of the back door. Nothing is getting in now, well at least not easily anyway.\n\nYou return to your room and check to see if your phone isn’t quite as damaged, as it appeared when you threw it against the wall, but of course it is. Hardly matters, you don’t have anyone to keep in contact with any more anyway.\n\nWith the gunfire still going on outside, you flop down on your couch-bed and realize that barring something trying to break in again, there’s nothing to do. You re-open your laptop and lose yourself in a game because it’s way better than reality right now.\n\nHours pass…\n\nYou look at the time on your laptop and realize you’ve been playing much longer than you intended to. You immediately get up to go wake up Johnny. It actually sounds like the gunfire has died down outside as well.\n\n“Hey Johnny wake up! It’s time to go. I know you said you had plans to steal a jeep, but I really think we should…”\n\nWhen you get to the living room though, Johnny is gone. You call out to him a couple times figuring that maybe he’s upstairs or even in the basement, but you get no answer.\n\nYou do see a note placed on the nearby end table in such a way that you’d notice it. You almost hesitate to pick it up, but of course you do anyway.\n\nTo my dearest Suzy,\n\nI’ve left to go get that jeep. I know you probably still want to use your sister’s car, but I still think our best shot is with a military vehicle. I figure we can blend in a whole lot better in one of those and not look suspicious while driving around at a casual glance by soldiers. Probably better at running over those rabid people too. We might even be able to get out of this forsaken town.\n\nAnyway, I left this note since I didn’t want to disturb you or cause any unpleasant arguments on this matter.\n\nI also know you didn’t leave while I slept, even though you could have. This means so much to me, I don’t think you know how much.\n\nI know I haven’t exactly given you much reason to not be distrustful of me, but the very fact that you didn’t leave tells me that you believe in me on some level. You know I’ll try to come through for you and that you’re willing to wait.\n\nI knew when I first heard your drunken whore of a sister talk about you; I thought you sounded like you were the one.\n\nThen when I saw and spoke with you, I was sure of it.\n\nI will come back tonight as planned, however if the situation becomes dangerous over there, then by all means escape in your sister’s car. It would never be my wish for you to stay in danger.\n\nForever my love,\nJohnny\n\nWhen the hell did he leave and write this? And how did you not hear him? He wasn’t joking about being stealthy you guess.\n\nOf course you probably would have known all this a lot sooner had you not got wrapped up in your game and actually left your room.\n\nAs for the note itself, well…it’s standard Johnny in the short term you’ve known him. The “whore” description of your sister is a bit of a standout from the rest of letter which is fairly white knightish.\n\nOf course you know damn well Johnny is far from being a “white knight”.\n\nSuddenly you hear the basement door opening. You tense up in fear since you’ve left not only the car keys but also your pistol in your room. You think at first you’re going to have to risk just running out the front door, but…\n\n“Hey Suzy! Suzy? I got the jeep, come on let’s get ready to go!” you hear Johnny’s voice call out.\n\nYou cautiously walk towards the hallway and see Johnny standing there looking into your room, then he turns his head and sees you. He’s got some clothing in his hand.\n\n“Oh there you are. I was worried for a moment that you had to run out in a hurry!”\n“Johnny, what the hell…didn’t you hear me calling you?” you ask.\n“No, I just got here.”\n“What? How? I’ve been in the living room for the past few minutes! You couldn’t have gotten by me.”\n“No I came in through the basement window. I couldn’t just leave the front door unlocked when I left.”\n“Basement win…wait I didn’t hear any glass breaking.”\n“That’s because it’s not broken. I had it so I could easily open it. Don’t worry, I thought about your safety. That window is pretty well hidden and not exactly easy to crawl through so I didn’t think any of those things would see it. They would’ve been more likely to just try to bash the ground floor doors or windows in.”\n“When did you mess around with the basement window and why didn’t you just tell me you were leaving?”\n“Didn’t you get my note? I explained why I left with bothering you in it.”\n“I only just finished reading it this minute.”\n“Oh, well I assumed you would’ve left your room before now. Anyway, here I got you these to wear. I think they might be a bit baggy, but they should work to help us blend in more.”\n\nJohnny shoves the clothing at you as if to distract you from asking more questions. It’s a uniform like what Johnny is wearing.\n\nYou almost ask Johnny how he got the uniform, but as with most things concerning Johnny you’re starting to think it might better if you don’t know.\n\nAs far as the basement window weirdness, you’re not going to dwell on it too much because it’s really not important right now.\n\n“Alright, that sounds like a good idea, I’ll go put these on.” You say and go to your room.\n“Um, don’t worry, I didn’t get those from a dead person or anything. It was a spare one I found.” Johnny blurts out.\n“Okay. I trust you Johnny.” You say which seems to make him smile.\n\nYou lock the door and change into the military fatigues. Granted you don’t see any blood or tears in the fatigues, but then he could’ve just choked the person wearing it to death.\n\n“(Sigh) Suzy, why the hell are you attracted to this guy? Oh right, because you’ve got some serious psychological issues yourself, that’s why.” You mumble to yourself as if being painfully aware of the situation makes everything okay.\n\nYou grab your bags and exit your room.\n\n“Glad to see the fatigues aren’t excessively big on you, I know you’re small framed and all. You ready to go?” Johnny asks.\n“Yeah, let’s get out of this place. How is it out there?”\n“In our immediate area? It’s fairly quiet now. Haven’t seen any of the rabid and the remainder of the Guard is busy burning bodies right now. I mean there are still patrols, but nobody even batted an eye when I drove this thing up to the house. Probably assumed whoever was inside was investigating or something. We shouldn’t linger here though.”\n\nWith both of you ready and as prepared as you’re going to be, you and Johnny exit out the front door and quickly enter the jeep which is sitting right next to your sister’s car. You have to admit, you do feel a little safer sitting in this thing than if you did in your sister’s car.\n\nJohnny starts up the vehicle and turns to you.\n\n“Suzy, you know I’ll take you anywhere you want to go. So is there any place you had in mind?” Johnny asks.\n‘Never been anywhere, so not really.” You answer.\n“I remember you saying you wanted to go home before.”\n“Well that would be nice, but things aren’t exactly normal any more. I mean the only reason for going back there would be to look for my brother’s bomb shelter, which definitely would be a safe zone knowing how Ben spent so much time building and constantly modifying it. Of course my other brother Peter is currently looking for it as well and who knows if he already claimed and locked himself inside it.”\n“Hmm, well it might be worth a look if you still want to try it. I mean the only other logical option I can think of is to as I suggested, leave town altogether. Should be much easier while driving around in this thing. Of course it might still be risky, if they’ve set up some sort of checkpoints outside of town…but maybe we can get the edge by fooling them briefly before smashing through such things.”\n\nPretty risky stuff, but then these are risky times.\n",
  "page 83": "You can’t stay with Johnny, he’s obviously unstable no matter how nice he is to you. You’re not going through it again.\n\nPlus you’re also worried about staying here any longer than you have to since you’re still paranoid that the National Guard will be sending someone here to search for their missing in action comrades.\n\nYou go back to your room and grab your bags. You start to make your way towards the living room, but then you think that perhaps maybe going out the back door would be better since you don’t have to sneak past Johnny to do so.\n\nThe back door is still a wreck from today’s earlier attack. When you open it up you finally see the thing that was trying to get in. Looks human enough minus the bullet holes and the slightly feral facial features. You just hope there aren’t anymore currently lurking about though the nearby gunfire isn’t encouraging.\n\nYou make your way through the backyard and then go around the house and finally reach Donna’s car. You quickly load your bags in, worrying the whole time you’re going to get attacked by one of those things or Johnny suddenly waking up and running out the front door. You get the impression he’s not going to be happy to find you gone when he wakes up.\n\nYou get in the car and you actually manage to swing the car out into the street before you hear shouting and then fired upon. Despite the sounds of glass shattering behind you. You keep it together and just drive hoping that there aren’t too many of the guard in front of you.\n\nIt’s a false hope as you do indeed bump into more than a couple patrols with itchy trigger fingers. Some you try to avoid by going down other streets. Others are actually busy fighting off others. How you aren’t hit by any that do shoot at you is something of a minor miracle, but the car certainly doesn’t come through unscathed since by the time you manage to make out of Julie’s neighborhood, it’s making rattling sounds.\n\nYou continue to drive and try to keep off the main streets though with your car now making several clattering sounds you’re not exactly keeping a low profile.\n\n“Just gotta make it home. I’ll be safe there.” You mumble to yourself.\n\nYour drive there isn’t quite as eventful as your escape from Julie’s house, but it isn’t without peril. The National Guard isn’t quite as in control in your part of the town and there are far more of the rabid roaming around either chasing down normal people or attempting to break into houses. Most of them don’t attempt to attack you, or if they do, you just continue driving fast enough that they don’t get the chance.\n\nBy the time you get to your own house, your neighborhood is eerily quiet. There are definitely signs of past conflict all over the place, but there is nobody on the streets and most homes are not lit either. (Though you do see broken doors and windows on a lot of them) Fortunately your own house doesn’t look damaged (At least not from the front)\n\nYou half expect to get swarmed by crazies as soon as you park in front of your house, but you manage to get in the house with your bags.\n\n“PETER?! Are you here?!” you call out when you get in the door and dump your bags on the floor. There is no answer, but then again maybe he’s already found the shelter.\n\nThe first thing you do is search the ground floor. Amazingly it doesn’t look like your house has been attacked at all. Even looking out into the backyard things look fairly untouched.\n\nThen you search the connected garage and that’s when you make an unexpected discovery.\n\nYou find Peter and another unknown man both not quite entirely dressed, but that isn’t the disturbing part. The fact that they’re both dead is the disturbing part.\n\nThe garage itself is a bit of a mess, like there was definitely a struggle, and your brother’s body and the body of who you presume is his lover or client both show signs of blunt trauma. Looks like their necks were both broken to ultimately kill them though.\n\nYou aren’t sure what to think. You feel like you should be more upset than you are, but given what an asshole he was towards you earlier and what you’ve already had to experience, you’re not having feelings of sorrow. You’re actually more concerned with how this happened. There isn’t anyone else here to your knowledge and if it had been one of those things, the bodies would probably have bite marks. You suppose it could’ve been regular bandits or robbers, but you’d expect gunshot or even knife wounds and neither have that.\n\nAlso if it was bandits that killed them, you wonder why they wouldn’t take Peter’s car since his keys are still sitting on a dresser nearby. Whether Peter was planning on leaving himself or still looking for Ben’s hidden shelter (And if he found it or not) you’ll never know you suppose.\n\nFeeling the fear of potential intruders in the house, you pull your pistol out and begin to search the rest of the house.\n\nYou head upstairs and cautiously search with your pistol drawn. Much like the downstairs though, you find that there isn’t anyone lurking up here. You even manage to find the courage to peek your head into Kelly’s room, but given how messy her usually room is, you don’t know if she’s ever returned here. You get the idea to call her up, but predictably there isn’t any answer. Who knows what’s happened to her.\n\nFinally you end your search of the house by heading to the place where you started from, the basement. Again, not much looks different and fortunately there isn’t anyone down here either. Your own room is about the same as you left it. You shake your head that the though of all the bullshit you went through this week, only to end up back here. Makes you wonder why you bothered.\n\nAfter a bit more perusal of your room, you head back upstairs to secure the ground floor as much as possible. You put chairs in front of the front and back doors. (As well as the one leading to the garage)\n\nYou also move a bookcase in front of some of the windows. It’s not the most fun thing to do and you bump and bang knees and elbows in the process, but it’s secure enough that you’re confident that if someone does try to get it, they’ll make such a loud noise in the process that you’ll at least wake up first.\n\nAs it starts to get darker, you decide to take your belongings to your old room in the basement where you figure you can turn on the lights without fear of someone potentially seeing them from the outside.\n\nAs you get resettled into your old room, you start to feel safer already. It’s odd that you should feel that way, but then this has always been your sanctuary. You do briefly worry about Johnny and if he’s going to try to track you down.\n\nWell if he does show up, you’ll be ready for him. You aren’t completely defenseless after all. Besides, he’ll have to get through the military and those things never mind the fact that he doesn’t know where you live in the first place. (At least you don’t think he does)\n\nDespite that, you’re going to try to remain positive. You make a plan to search for the shelter entrance in the backyard tomorrow and you figure if all else fails you can always take Peter’s car and try to make it out of town.\n\nFor now though, you’re going to enjoy a good night’s sleep in the safety of your own room.\n",
  "page 85": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“Wakey wakey sis.” You hear a voice say.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and at first see what looks to be a man standing in front of you holding a shotgun. Your first instinct is that it’s Johnny, but then after the blur of your eyes clears a bit, you see that it’s your sister Kelly.\n\nLooks like she’s still hostile to you as well considering she’s pointing a shotgun at you. You don’t know why, but then has she ever needed a reason?\n\nYou look at your pistol on the floor near the couch you’re sleeping on and Kelly just shakes her head.\n\n“I guarantee you wouldn’t make it sis. I suggest you don’t even try…heh I doubt you’d have the balls to go through with it anyway. I have to admit when I came up here to get something from my room, I didn’t expect to glance over this way and see you sleeping here.”\n\nUp? Where the hell would she come “up” from? You’re in the basement now. Kelly’s blocking your doorway, but you think you can make out a glowing light source coming from the basement floor beyond. And then it hits you.\n\n“…he moved the fucking shelter entrance in the house? And it’s been right near my goddamn room all this time?” you ask.\n“Hey hey! It’s about time you used that blonde head of yours other than taking up space!” Kelly mocks.\n\nWell you know where the entrance is, but unfortunately you’ve got bigger issues now. Kelly pointing a shotgun at you is concerning to be sure and makes you think back to what you saw in the garage. Peter and the other man’s body. Their bodies were beaten and their necks were broken. Kelly certainly has the strength and the skill to do such a thing. Kelly’s always been hostile to you and barely civil to your other sibling, but to actually kill one…\n\n“When did you find out? When you killed Peter?”\n“Pfft. I’ve always known. Crazy old Ben thought he was being so sneaky moving the goddamn entrance around all the time, but I knew where the fuck it was nearly every time. He had just moved the entrance again a few days before he blew away his family and himself. I’m just surprised YOU never accidently found it given that you lived practically right near the fucking thing for years. If the entrance was any closer you would’ve been sleeping in the damn thing.”\n\nKelly continues to address you while briefly looking over her shoulder.\n\n“As for Peter, that little faggot managed to find out where it was and thought he was going to hide out from the current shitstorm in it with his boyfriend or whoever that other faggot he was with. Had to convince him that he had to go, he didn’t listen and tried to resist and well you saw how that turned out.”\n\nKelly briefly shifts a bit in your doorway, but still holding the shotgun firmly on you of course.\n\n“So where’s that little whore Donna? Heard you moved in with her. She come with you? Julie maybe? Both? How the fuck did any of you survive the week?” Kelly asks.\n“I’m here by myself Kelly. I have no idea what happened to Donna, or Julie for that matter. I…I think they’re probably dead.” You say.\n“Mmm, well you’ll soon be joining them.” Kelly remarks and raises the shotgun as if she’s trying to get a more precise aim.\n\nTerror wells up inside you.\n\n“Wait! Can’t you let me go? I mean I’ll take Peter’s car and leave! You’ll never have to see me again! I mean you can’t have mercy on me just this once?” you exclaim and tears forming in your eyes.\n\nKelly smiles sadistically and laughs.\n\n“God, you really are as stupid as you are pathetic. You know that? If I let you leave, do you really think you could survive out there with no supplies? How long would you be able to last without resorting to trading your own ass for safety? Not long I’d wager and that’s assuming you don’t just get raped and killed first or ripped apart by those freaks. I’m doing you a favor sis.” Kelly remarks.\n\nYou start to cry as you realize that this is it. You’re going to die.\n\n“Oh for fuck’s sake, will you stop crying and be fucking brave for once in your life? (Sigh) Fine, you want me to show you mercy? Here.” Kelly leans her shotgun against the wall nearby.\n\nAt first you think she’s going to spare your life, but you soon learn it’s just another sick game.\n\n“Okay sis, despite my undying hatred for you, I’m going to give you ONE chance just because out of all our siblings, I still think you were the one with the most potential. It’s just too bad you wasted it. So, here’s your second chance. Try to grab your pistol before I can grab my shotgun.”\n“But…(sniff) you’re right next to your shotgun, you can grab it a lot easier than I can grab the pistol. You’ll kill me before I even can reach it.” You say.\n“So what have you got to lose? You’re going to die anyway, so try to stop me.”\n\nYou don’t say anything. You just quietly weep a bit at your situation. You thought you were safe, but how wrong you were. You really wish Johnny was here, but there’s not going to be a rescue this time.\n\n“Goddamn it Suzy, if you don’t make a move, I’m gonna just…shit!”\n\nYou react while Kelly is in the middle of her sentence. You scramble for the weapon and you actually manage to touch it and then a loud blast is the last thing you hear.\n",
  "page 121": "As angry as you are, making some foolish attempt to stand up to Kelly while she’s holding all the advantages is not going to help anyone. You’ll have to re-supply elsewhere, at least you have a better car now.\n\n“Okay, okay, we’re leaving Kelly. You got all the advantages and you win.” You say.\n“Damn straight I win.” Kelly snorts.\n\nJulie removes the barricades the front door and cautiously looks around.\n\n“Come on, come on, if any of those crazy fuckers were out there, they would’ve been beating down the doors and windows by now.” Kelly says motioning the pair of you to leave quicker.\n\nJulie exits and when you step up to the entryway, Kelly speaks up.\n\n“Hey Suzy.”\n“Yeah?” you answer turning around.\n“Changed my mind. I fucking hate you too much.”\n\nAnd with those words Kelly blasts you in the chest with the shotgun. Julie screams and Kelly laughs, but you make no more sounds at all other than your body falling backwards on the cement.\n",
  "page 242": "You’re sick of everyone trying to control your life. You weren’t putting up with it with Bobby, and you’re sure as hell not going to put up with it with Jake.\n\n“Are you just assuming I can’t carry the boxes around because I’m a woman?” you ask.\n“What? No, that’s not it…” Jake starts to say before you interrupt.\n“You just said a little thing like me doesn’t want to lug boxes around like I’m some helpless damsel.”\n“Look, as a businessman it’s my job to match up potential employees with what they’re probably going to be best at. The fact is you ARE on the smaller side, not to mention you’ve just told me you’ve never done a hard day’s work in your life. So yeah, I don’t think you’re strong enough to do the job and not bitch about it or even get that much work done. I’d rather have you out here working the register.”\n“You just want me out here as eye candy for the customers.” You reply.\n“Jesus fucking Christ, I didn’t realize I was hiring a FemiNazi. Are you telling me you want to move boxes?” Jake says in exasperation.\n“I’m not a goddamn FemiNazi and no I don’t want particularly want to move boxes, but my point is you just took the damn choice out of my hands and made a stupid assumption that I couldn’t do the job due to your own narrow-mindedness.”\n\nJack exhales again and rubs his face.\n\n“Are you kidding fucking me? You’re arguing about a job you don’t even want? In fact, you don’t even want THIS job! You know how many employers would’ve thrown you out with that sort of shitty work ethic and you haven’t even started yet! I’m fucking helping YOU out by hiring you in the first place with absolutely no skills or experience and you’re giving me shit already! It’s not like I’m grabbing your ass and telling you to suck my dick! I’m trying to be a nice guy here.”\n“Given with how you’re speaking to me, you’re not really all that fucking nice.” You respond.\n“Alright, I’ve had it. Get the fuck out of my shop. You probably think because you’re pretty you can just get what you want well not this time bitch. I got enough shit to deal with, get the fuck out! Get out! Get out! Get out!” Jake yells and points at the door.\n“FUCKING ASSHOLE!” you shout as loud as you can and storm out the shop.\n\nWell that could’ve went better.\n\nAs you walk to your car, several nerd types are just now approaching the store. While they’re probably the sort that would’ve been staring at you all day if you’d been working at the shop, now they’re actively avoiding you since you’re mumbling and swearing to yourself like a crazy person.\n\nYour swearing continues when you’re actually in the car. You bang on the steering wheel several times in frustration.\n\n“I hate my fucking life!” you cry out and begin to sob.\n\nLife just isn’t fair Suzy and lately for you it’s only been getting harder. All you wanted to do is hang out in your basement, hiding out from the rest of the world. Now your forced to deal with all this shit that you’re just no good at and when you do try to assert yourself, you fail at that too.\n\nIf you were fighting depression before, you’re currently getting your ass kicked by it. It’s a good thing you aren’t suicidal, but the thought is starting to cross your mind.\n\nAfter taking a moment to pull yourself together, you think about what you need to do next.\n\n“Okay…I need to go back home. Need to pack up all the most important shit I have and head over to Julie’s house.” You say to yourself.\n\nWith this new goal in mind, you pull out of the comic shop parking lot and intend on making your way back home.\n\nYou don’t get a couple blocks before you soon discover the way you came is barricaded due to an accident or something. There are ambulances and police cars blocking the way and you realize you’re going to have to go a different direction.\n\nYou go down some side streets and find out that they currently aren’t much better and in one instance actually worse as a bunch of people have made a makeshift barricade with overturned cars and some of them are shooting at each other. You get the hell out of the area as fast as you can before someone starts shooting at you.\n\nAfter having to drive around avoiding barricades, downed power lines, overturned vehicles and general chaos, you begin to get even more frustrated since it’s starting to look like you can’t even get home. Or at least not by driving there and given the shit that’s going on, you’ll be damned if you’re going to get out of your vehicle to walk home.\n\n“Goddamn it, I just want to get the fuck home! Fuck it, I’m just going to go to Julie’s now…” you shout to yourself.\n\nIt’s a further drive, but considering Julie lives in a better area, you’re hoping that maybe things won’t be as bad driving in that direction. You soon find out that isn’t the case as you’re desperately trying to avoid getting into an accident every five minutes.\n\n“Seriously what the hell is going on with this town? Everyone is acting like an asshole even more than usual.” You say and you’re starting to wonder if there’s something in the water.\n\nTurning on the radio doesn’t help, since you’re not getting much on it save for those annoying Ground Zero ads.\n\n“Come on, there’s gotta be something about…SHIT!” you say when look up from the radio and are just in time to see a bus turning left and about to hit you.\n\nYou swerve immediately to avoid being hit, but unfortunately you slam the car into another speeding car, which crashes into your passenger side at full force.\n\nYou are knocked around as your car goes spinning across the street. It all happens so fast you don’t even have time to panic or feel the fear of possibly dying right now.\n\nA large black truck slams on its breaks in an attempt to not hit you, which it succeeds in doing, only for your car to be stopped by lamppost instead. Thanks to airbags never working correctly when they should, you hit your head on the steering wheel hard and while you don’t quite knock yourself out you definitely scramble your brains a bit and you’re feeling pretty dazed.\n\nWhile you’re still recovering, you suddenly hear knocking on your window and a voice.\n\n“Hey, miss. Miss? You alright?”\n\nYou slowly look out your window and see a woman wearing glasses and dressed in business attire staring back at you. Well actually you’re sort of seeing two of her and the image is still a little blurry, but that’s the size of it.\n\nYou unhook your seat belt and get out of the car wincing in a bit of pain as you do so. The businesswoman helps you from falling since you’re still wobbly.\n\n“You’re lucky to be alive, I’ve seen a shitload of crashes like yours since I’ve been driving through town today. I only just managed to put on my breaks when I saw your car spinning out of control like that.” she remarks.\n\nYou don’t really answer her; you just turn to look at the car, which is totaled. Besides part of the front being wrapped around a now leaning lamppost, the passenger side is trashed and you certainly aren’t going to be driving anywhere soon due to the front wheel area being caved in and the axel broken.\n\nYou just look at the wreckage of the car silently and then start to giggle at the situation. Soon the giggling becomes full blown laughter and the woman that helped you out of the car gives you a strange look.\n\n“Are you alright?” she asks again.\n“Oh I’m just peachy! This has been a wonderful day!” you say laughing.\n“Do you know your name and where you’re at?”\n“Yeah, my name is mud and I’m in a world of shit.” You say still laughing.\n\n“Um, well you seem to be having a bit of difficulty balancing and you’ve got a nasty bruise on your forehead. You might have a concussion and given your laughter you might even be in some state of shock. I think it would be best if you had some medical attention.”\n\nYou look at the woman that’s trying to help you and begin to stop laughing quite as hard and your mind starts heading back to earth again. Your head and body remind you of the pain you’re actually still in.\n\n“Yeah…yeah…maybe. Shit, my head does hurt… I guess…can you drive me to the hospital?” you ask.\n“The hospital? Yeah, that place is sort of fucked right now. Even if we could get to it in this mess of chaos, the place has been overflowing with patients and you might be waiting a long time, if they get to you at all. I’m not sticking around in this town any longer than I need to. However, my brother is a doctor with his own private practice just outside town; he can probably check you out for free. It won’t be any problem since I’m going to him right now.” The woman says.\n\nWell it’s either head somewhere with a complete stranger or try to make it to the hospital (or wherever) in your current condition.\n",
  "page 120": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“I got your call. Wakey wakey sis.” You hear a voice say.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and at first see what looks to be a man standing in front of you holding a shotgun. Then after the blur of your eyes clears a bit, you see that it’s your sister Kelly.\n\nUnfortunately it looks like not all your family is dead after all and of course it had to be Kelly that survived. Judging by the fact she’s pointing a shotgun at you she’s still hostile as well. You don’t know why, but then has she ever needed a reason?\n\nYou look at the pistol on the table and Kelly just shakes her head.\n\n“I guarantee you wouldn’t make it sis. I suggest you don’t even try…heh I doubt you’d have the balls to go through with it anyway. I have to admit when I came up here to get something from my room, I didn’t expect to see you here.”\n\nAt this point Julie wakes up.\n\n“Suzy what’s going…oh my god…” she says upon seeing Kelly.\n“Shhh, it’ll be okay.” You say trying to reassure Julie.\n“So when did you turn dyke Suzy? Always sort of figured you might be down for the rug munching. Guess that’s why things didn’t work out with Bobby eh? Still though, Julie? I have to say even I think you could do better than some used up party whore. Now the pair of you lesbos sit up.”\n\nAt this point you and Julie move and shift on the couch until you’re both sitting upright. In the meantime Kelly grabs your pistol from the table and places it in the front of her pants. She continues to focus the shotgun on you.\n\nGiven that you barricaded all the doors and searched the entire house last night you wonder how the hell Kelly got in. If she had been lurking inside, she definitely would’ve made her presence known and ambushed you yesterday and if she broke in, you definitely would’ve heard something before now.\n\nYou’re also a little concerned not just because Kelly’s pointing a shotgun at you, but you think back to what you saw in the garage. Peter and the other man’s body. Their bodies were beaten and their necks were broken. Kelly certainly has the strength and the skill to do such a thing. Kelly’s always been hostile to you and barely civil to your other sibling, but to actually kill one…\n\n“Kelly, our siblings Peter and Donna are dead.” You say.\n“Peter’s dead?” Julie says.\n“Oh? Didn’t know that about Donna. Can’t say I’ll shed any tears. The spoiled little whore wasn’t much better than your girlfriend here.”\n“She was fucking chopped up by a goddamn serial killer, you bitch!” Julie exclaims.\n“Hm, interesting. So how did you two survive?”\n“I shot him.”\n\nKelly’s a little taken back.\n\n“Wow, I’m impressed. Guess you would have the balls to use this pistol then. Tell me, was that the only person you killed this week little sister?”\n“No… I shot one of those rabid people too. Ran over a couple as well.”\n“Well, well, well aren’t you the bad ass now? Heh. Funny what an extreme situation like this can do to folks isn’t it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Yeah…so I’m guessing if you know about Peter, you’ve probably figured out by now what happened or at least have a strong suspicion. You’re a lot of things Suzy, but I’d never call you an idiot.”\n“I appreciate that. So why’d you do it?”\n\nKelly chuckles a bit before answering.\n\n“That little faggot found out where Ben’s old shelter was and thought he was going to hide out from the current shitstorm in it with his boyfriend or whoever that other faggot he was with. Had to convince him that he had to go, he didn’t listen and tried to resist and well you saw how that turned out.”\n“So you know where Ben’s old shelter is then.” You say.\n“Oh yeah. I’ve always known where it was. Crazy old Ben thought he was being so sneaky moving the goddamn entrance around all the time, but I knew where the fuck it was nearly every time. He had just moved the entrance again a few days before he blew away his family and himself. I’m just surprised YOU never accidently found it given that you lived practically right near the fucking thing for years. If the entrance was any closer you would’ve been sleeping in the damn thing.”\n\nWell that explains how Kelly got in without alerting you. Still, if she’s actually admitting the entrance to the shelter is somewhere in the basement and what she did to Peter, then that pretty much confirms she has no intention of sharing.\n\n“So what’s next Kelly? You gonna kill us too?”\n“Don’t know sis…don’t know…severely thinking about it. I’ve never like you. You’ve been a thorn in my side since you crawled out of mom’s vagina. Always having to be compared to how good and pretty you were and how bad and rotten I was despite the fact I was the one who was shouldering most of the responsibility in this fucked up family. What did you ever do except hide in the goddamn basement? Even now you left the house only to come crawling back here. Yep, I’ve thought about killing you on many, many, MANY occasions.”\n“Actually that wasn’t my initial intention. My initial plan was to drive out of this forsaken town. I only stopped here because our own car was badly damaged and I had hoped to maybe get Peter’s car and some extra supplies before heading out again.” You say.\n“Oh? Hmm, you’re just full of surprises today aren’t you? Well if that is true, you may have just bought yourself a bit of a reprieve sis…okay. What the hell, I’m in a good mood. I’m gonna let you and your whore walk outta here alive and you’re going to be thankful.”\n“I don’t suppose you’ll allow us to gather our bags or give me the gun back will you?” You say.\n“Heh, no I don’t think so. Wouldn’t want you getting any ideas of attempting to come back here. Leave with what you got on you or die, those are your choices sis. I’m being very generous here. Take my offer.”\n\nYou stare at Kelly, but it’s not with fear. It’s with anger. Anger at all the past abuse you’ve had to endure from her. While she may have a minor point that you were the favorite and she did a lot for the family, she still had no right to bully and torment you for the majority of your life and she certainly had no right to murder Peter.\n\n“Come on Suzy, let’s go…” Julie says wanting for the both of you to be out of danger.\n",
  "page 241": "Considering you’d rather just sit on your ass and work the register than lift boxes anyway, there doesn’t seem to be much point in engaging in an argument that will lose you this job opportunity. Honestly you’re just lucky that Jake is willing to hire you and isn’t making advances on you (yet).\n\nJake proceeds to show you how to work the register and the credit card machine. After a few trial runs and examples, you think you got it. The funny thing is, nobody has actually come into the comic shop yet.\n\n“See, not very difficult. So, you think you’re ready to officially take the responsibility of the register?” Jake asks.\n“Yeah, I guess, but is it always this empty?” you ask.\n“No, not usually. It’s about…what a little after noon now? Yesterday was slow as well, but I’m chalking it up to all the craziness going on in town, which I’m really hoping dies down soon. There is a group of regulars that should be arriving in few moments though. They usually just hang out here all fucking day, but they tend to buy a lot when they actually do decide to part with their money and not drive me up a fucking wall with their banter. However since you’re working the register, you’ll get to put up with them this time.”\n“Great, can’t wait.” You say and sit at the register unenthusiastically.\n\nJake proceeds to tell you that if you need anything he’ll be in his office catching up on going over his financial books. He also warns you not to steal anything, which seems weird since if you were going to steal something, it’s not like you’d listen to his warning.\n\nWithout many more words Jake disappears into his office and you sit at the register waiting for customers to come in. While you wait you start looking at the various items near the counter and start reading through some of the comics.\n\nAs time passes you continue to hear the sounds of sirens and such in the distance. Through the windows you see a couple of police officers running in the direction where you saw those barricades.\n\nA little more time passes and a short man who looks to be in his mid thirties enters. He’s dressed in casual clothing and just nods at you when he sees you at the register. In an attempt to be a friendly, you smile and wave hi before he goes off to look at comics.\n\nWell either Jake was exaggerating about his customers being sex crazed assholes or this guy isn’t one of the “regulars” he was talking about. You watch him for a moment as he browses and takes various comics off the shelves. He looks like he’s really into comics with as many as he’s taking. Eventually he comes up to the counter with a stack of comic books.\n\n“Can I just sit these here for now? I’m not really done looking yet, but I don’t want to lug around a bunch of comics and possibly dropping them all over the place.” The man asks.\n“Oh yeah sure. I guess you really like comics huh?” you say.\n“Heh, I suppose I look a little obsessed. I don’t really come in here that much since normally I tend to buy stuff online, but this is one of those times where I don’t have the luxury of waiting for stuff to arrive in the mail. So I’m loading up now that I’m here. Never seen you here before though.” The man says.\n“I’m new. Just started today actually and you’re sort of my first customer. Nobody else has come in.” you reply.\n“Oh. Well, this is sort of an interesting day to start a new job given what’s been going on in town lately. I’m betting that’s why there hasn’t been anyone else in here today.”\n“Yeah, tell me about it. I wouldn’t have left the house if I had the choice.”\n“Yeah, I hear you, I don’t like going out too much myself, but I’ve been getting better about it lately.”\n“Same here and it still sucks, but bills aren’t going to pay themselves.”\n“I sort of got around that by being able to work at home. I used to sell and buy shit on the Internet a lot.”\n“What, like Ebay or something?”\n“Yeah something like that. Buy low, sell high, that sort of thing.”\n“I wish I could do something like that.”\n“You can, it’s not really difficult.”\n“Eh, I’m not really a wheeler and dealer type. Besides, if I had a job involving a computer, especially one involving self employment, I’d probably just goof off and never get any work accomplished.”\n“Well that’s the beauty of working at home. You can sort of be as lazy as you want!” The man says with slight grin.\n“Oh I don’t think you know exactly how lazy I can be.” You say returning the smile.\n“You can’t be that lazy, you’re working here.”\n“Well like I said, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have to be. (Sigh) Events however have conspired against me and here I am.”\n“Yeah, always sucks when things out of your control put you in a bad situation. For what it’s worth, sorry you’re in such a bind.”\n\nYou didn’t expect sympathy for your minor “pity party” but you’ll definitely accept it. You usually aren’t one to hold long conversations with random strangers, but then it’s been a bit of an unusual week for you.\n\n“Thanks, so selling and buying shit on the Internet works for you huh? I suppose maybe I could do it. There’s certainly already enough crap around the house that surely someone would be interested in. Obviously with as many comics as you intend on buying you’re making a good living at it.” You say.\n“Well I probably would be if I wasn’t a bit of a hoarder and kept most of the shit I did buy. However, I made enough that I pulled my weight so my mom didn’t kick me out of the basement of the house. Yeah, I know I’m a walking stereotype, basement dweller in a comic shop. Big surprise right?” the man remarks.\n\nYou don’t reply immediately, you just briefly think about how odd it is you’ve got so much in common with a complete stranger.\n\n\n“Oh, I dunno. I don’t tend to judge people.” You reply.\n“Well that’s a rare trait these days. Though I suppose I’m more of a hermit than a basement dweller nowadays anyway. My mother died a few years ago and I’m not even going to be living here anymore soon. Hence another reason why I’m loading up on books now.”\n“So wait you’re moving out of town?” you say a bit surprised.\n“Yeah…I guess you could say that. I mean under normal circumstances I wouldn’t bother, but it’s getting really bad out there and it’s only going to get worse.”\n“Worse? How do you know? You don’t think things will get back to normal in a few days?”\n\nThe man starts like he’s about to say more, but stops. Then he stumbles over some words a bit before continuing.\n\n“Um…it’s just…well these things…you never can tell right? I guess I don’t really know. I think I’m just rambling at this point and not making any sense. I didn’t mean to talk your ear off. I guess I should get back to it and let you get back to doing your job.” The man says and then briskly walks to the back of the comic shop.\n\nYou nearly tell him to come back to talk to clarify what he meant and that he wasn’t really bothering you, but then you think that would be a bit strange and also you don’t really know this guy.\n\nHe’s probably a weirdo anyway; he just said he lived in his mom’s basement until she died after all. You don’t even know why you’re even still thinking about it or him.\n\n“Christ Suzy, you’re taking the break up harder than you thought. You’re starting to latch on to minor conversations with complete fucking strangers. Get a grip already.” You say to yourself.\n\nA sudden brick through one of the shop windows breaks up your introspective moment.\n\nYou duck down behind the counter and then Jake comes out running out of his office.\n\n“What the fuck is going on out here?!” he exclaims.\n“I don’t know! Someone just threw a brick through…”\n\nBefore you can complete that sentence you hear a bunch of laughter and the shop door opening up. You continue to stay hidden behind the counter.\n\n“Did you see that shit? Told ya I could land the brick right in the middle of the O on the window!” a young male voice exclaims.\n“Yeah, yeah, let’s just see what we got in here…” another remarks.\n“What the fuck do you little shits think you’re doing? You just broke my fucking window! I hope you fuckers got some money to pay for that RIGHT NOW or else I’m going to be kicking all of your asses THEN I’m going to your parents’ houses and kicking their asses for not aborting you.” Jake exclaims.\n“Oh fuck off Jake, with as much as you’ve ripped us off by overcharging, I’d say that more than covers the cost of your goddamn window. We’re going to be taking some free comics too.” You hear a voice shout back.\n“Look, I dunno what the fuck has compelled you social rejects even THINK you can get away with this, but if you don’t fucking get out of my shop right fucking now, there are going to be consequences you aren’t going to walk away from.”\n“Ohhh, so fucking scared Jake.” You hear one say who from the sound of the voice sounds like he’s getting closer.\n“HEY! Step back from the counter!”\n\nYou hear someone hit the counter and then you look up to see a pimply teenager staring over at you.\n\n“Holy shit guys! Jake’s got a fucking bitch hiding over here! She looks hot too, no wonder he’s fucking pissed! She was probably blowing him before we came in!” he exclaims and then tries to grab your hair at which point you slap his hand away and stand up and away from the counter so you can’t be molested.\n\nIt’s at this point you finally see the motley lot. Four teenage boys of all varying shapes and sizes. You don’t know who these guys are, but if they’re the “regulars” Jake mentioned, they’re certainly not acting like what you expected.\n\n“Goddamn Jake how the hell you manage to pull this off? She looks way too fucking hot for you. She a whore or something?” The tallest boy asks.\n“Hey, you know who she looks like? She looks like that cute zombie chick.” The fattest one says.\n“Nah, she looks more like that chick who controls all the dragons.” The pimply one remarks.\n“For fuck’s sake she’s blonde not a goddamn albino, she doesn’t look like either of them, the pair of you are idiots. She obviously looks like the blonde chick that fucks vampires.” The tallest one remarks.\n“Which one, Trent?” the fat one asks.\n“The one that’s mainly killing them too.” Trent says.\n“I dunno guys, I thought she looked like that chick that was a private investigator…” another one begins to say before Jake interrupts their temporary distraction of comparing you to various female nerd culture figures.\n\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY SHOP! I’M NOT WARNING YOU AGAIN!” Jake shouts.\n\nAt which point Trent pulls a pistol out of his hoodie pocket. He doesn’t actually point it at Jake, but he’s definitely warning him by just showing it. Jake steps back a bit, but doesn’t lose his cool. You on the other hand are really worried, especially considering you got four hormone addled teenage guys staring at you.\n\n“And I’m telling YOU we’re not fucking leaving without getting our comics! Don’t you know what today is? It’s fucking free comic book day Jake!”\n“This is how you want to play this Trent?” Jake asks.\n\nNow Trent points the pistol at Jake and gives a look of less playfulness and more deadly seriousness.\n\n“I’m not fucking playing Jake, just like I wasn’t fucking playing with my mom when she told me to clean my room two days ago, just like I wasn’t playing with those assholes yesterday that used to give me wedgies back in sixth grade or that bitch who wouldn’t go out with me even though I did a whole bunch of nice shit for her. Things are changing around this town and if you ain’t changing with it, you’re gonna get rolled over.”\n\nTrent looks over at his fellows and waves as if he’s telling them to take whatever they want. He continues to point the gun at Jake though he keeps an eye on you as well.\n\nWhile you’re a little busy worrying about Trent and the rest, you realize you haven’t seen that guy you were talking to before. You can’t imagine he managed to slip out without anyone noticing. He might be hiding, but if he is, he’s doing a really good job, because with the way Trent’s pals are going through the store, it seems like they would have stumbled upon him by now.\n\nWhile they do that, Trent gets closer to Jake still holding the gun to him.\n\n“So what is the story with the blonde bitch anyway Jake? I know she can’t be your girlfriend. A fat old loser like you wouldn’t have one.” Trent sneers, but Jake is still keeping composure.\n\n“I hired her to work the register today.” Jake remarks.\n“Hm. I’d rather see her mouth work my dick.” Trent says looking you up and down. Jake starts laughing.\n\n“What’s so fucking funny?”\n“YOU! You’re fucking funny Trent. You’re calling me a loser and apparently you can’t even GET a woman without holding her at gunpoint. Pfft. I don’t give a shit what little emo angsty shooting spree trip you’re on, but I’m not playing. I still remember when you were in here as a little kid and your ugly ass mama beat the hell out of you for shitting your pants. How you cried and cried.” Jake chuckles.\n\nTrent of course is not amused and points the gun closer to Jake.\n\n“Shut the fuck up fat ass!” he exclaims.\n“Make me lanky bitch!” Jake says and suddenly grabs Trent’s hand now that it’s close enough. The pair of them struggle with the weapon and Trent begins calling for his fellows to help.\n\nWhile you’re certainly close enough to help Jake before Trent’s buddies get to him, you see the front door and wonder if you shouldn’t just jump over the counter and get the hell out of here.\n",
  "page 6": "You should head back home to gather your things and you at least should return Peter’s car back. You’re confident that he’d drive you back here.\n\nYou still aren’t sure about calling Bobby. If he finds out your intentions, he might do something crazy…well other than the usual craziness he participates in. Might be best to still not return his call.\n\n“I appreciate this opportunity Roofie. I’ll be back later today or tomorrow morning at the latest.”\n“Hm, okay. See you later then.” Roofie says and you leave the tent to quickly make your way back to your car.\n\nYou realize that you’re still in your clown outfit as you’re driving off. Oh well it hardly matters. Well other than Peter is probably going to get freaked out when he sees you.\n\nYou head back towards town and halfway there you suddenly hear the sound of a tire blowing out.\n\n“Oh what the fuck!?” you exclaim, in your attempt to keep the car from swerving. You pull over to the side of the road.\n\nYou get out and see your front driver side tire is completely fucked. While you don’t have any experience in changing one yourself, you go and check if there is a spare anyway.\n\nYou open the trunk and of course there is nothing in there. Or rather nothing that can help you. You do find a bunch of your old clothes that Peter probably stole a long time ago..\n\nWhile its possible someone random might try to help you on this road, you don’t hold out a lot of hope. Or rather the element that usually traverses this area usually consists of trailer trash types that you definitely don’t want to put up with.\n\nLacking any better options, you decide to call your younger sister Donna and hope that maybe she’s not bust partying. No answer, but you leave a message. You also call Julie, but have the same amount of luck.\n\nYou then try to call Peter, since he’ll definitely want to know about his car. Again, you get no answer, so you leave a message.\n\nSome cars pass you on the road, so far its looking like nobody is helping you. You wonder if it might be the clown costume though. You have the temptation to call Bobby, but you resist.\n\n“Great. I finally start to get something going with my life and fate decides to kick me in the face for it.” You say sitting in the car.\n\nIt starts to get dark and nobody has returned your call yet. Tired of waiting around for help you come to a decision.\n\nYou go back and grab your old clothes from the trunk of the car and start walking back to the carnival. It’ll be a long walk, but given how everyone in your family has failed spectacularly in even returning your call you figure you’ll be better off just making a clean break and not go back home after all. At least you’ve got a few extra clothes.\n\nYou walk for quite some time and a couple vehicles pass you, but once again nobody offers you a ride. Looks like the clown outfit might be warding off people. As they say, there is nothing funny about a clown in the moonlight.\n\nThere is also nothing funny about two rednecks in a pick up truck at night either…\n\nAnd that’s exactly who rides up along side you. A fear wells up within you, but you try to ignore it.\n\n“Woo weee! Look at chu’. You from dat carnival a few miles up dah road?” one of them shouts from the passenger side.\n“Something like that.”\n“Mm, yeah I don’t usually go fer clowns…but damn are you fine. You fill out that outfit something fierce! You remind me of that girl from the funny books. Y’know that crazy guy’s girlfriend who fights that bat guy.”\n\nYou continue to try to ignore him and step up your pace.\n\n“So, you need a lift back to your carnival sweetheart? We got room.”\n“No, the back of your truck looks full of scrap metal.”\n“Oh honey, you wouldn’t ride back there. You’d ride up here with us. Maybe you could even sit in my lap.”\n\nYou’re starting to get worried now.\n\n“No, I’m okay. Thanks though.”\n“I don’t think yer understandin’ me missy, this ain’t a fuckin’ request! Hugo stop the goddamn truck, this one’s gonna give us shit!” the hick says and you don’t even waste time, you start running before he even gets out of the truck.\n\nIt’s a long dark lonely road and you’re a young woman screaming and running from psycho hillbillies. It would sound like a bad horror movie if it weren’t actually happening.\n\nSo far you’re out pacing them so you figure if you stick to the road you’ll be fine and maybe even be lucky enough to have someone pass by to help you.\n\nYou look back and see the one from the passenger seat still far behind you, in fact you don’t even see the other one. But you do hear shouting by the one chasing you.\n\nIn a few moments you hear the sound of an engine see the glow of headlights right behind you. They’re not going to bother chasing you so much as they’re just going to run you down!\n\nAt this point you get off the road and you do, but the truck just follows you into the high grass and at the speed it’s going it succeeds in hitting you at a good speed. You go flying several feet way into the field.\n\nYou still live, but your body is broken in several places. You cry out followed by several whimpers of someone to help you. Of course there is no one and all it does is let the two hicks know where you’ve landed. You can’t even crawl away.\n\nIn a few moments the truck pulls up near your area and your fear and anguish is overwhelming you. This is it. This is how it’s going to end.\n\n“Heard that bitch scream, she’s gotta be here somewhere…got her.” The hillbilly says shining a flashlight in your bloody face.\n\n“Sheet. You ain’t much now are ya bitch? If you’d gotten in when I told ya, We might’ve even let ya go after we were done havin’ our fun. But noooo, you stuck up pretty bitches always gotta do things da hard way. Fuck it. I don’t care if you are all broken, I’m getting’ a piece of this.”\n\nDuring the last agonizing moments of life are thoughts of how you should’ve stayed in the basement.\n",
  "page 145": "Honestly you don’t know if it’s a good idea or not, but you’re staying at least for now.\n\n“I still think running on our own is a bad idea. I say we stick around at least for the rest of the day, I mean it’s no good walking off now with the sun about to go down. If it looks like things aren’t going to be too good for us here, I mean we can leave sometime tomorrow. I doubt if the military is going to send anyone else here THAT quick.”\n“Okay, ugh. I still think this is a bad idea, but I suppose I could use that time to try to find someone who would let us borrow their vehicle. That would at least save us from walking.”\n“Borrow? Didn’t know if we were leaving that we were planning on returning.” You snicker.\n“Well, maybe other people will be getting ready to leave too, and maybe we can catch a ride with them at least.”\n“Well that would make leaving at least more of an appealing prospect.” You say and start to leave.\n“Where are you going?”\n“If we’re going to stay, I should find out what the game plan is with the rest of these folks. If it looks like they don’t have their shit together, well that’s another mark in favor of leaving.”\n“Hm, well I suppose I’ll go see if Tina’s done arguing with her boyfriend or whoever he is to her, maybe I can see if she’s receptive to the idea of leaving.”\n\nAt this point you and Donna split up. You mainly wander the trailer park a bit where you occasionally get some stares and a few cat calls, but mostly everyone is busily running around cleaning up or holding various weapons or building supplies in their hands. Mostly all the men.\n\nWhile there is a lot of shouting in general going on, one of these trailer folk is standing around seemingly barking orders at the rest. It’s Mel, Tina’s boyfriend from earlier.\n\n“Get those vehicles to block the main entrance to this place and drag those fucking dead to the field behind this place. We’ll bury their remains there in a big ass pit. After getting everything useful out of those military trucks, we’re going to need to start stripping them down…hey you…blondie, this ain’t no place for ya, I’m tryin’ to get some fuckin’ work done an’ I can’t have you here.” Mel exclaims.\n“What? I’m not in anyone’s way and I live in this place! Why can’t I be here?” you ask.\n“Because like I said, I’m TRYING to light a fire under these fuckers’ asses, and I can’t do that, if half of them are staring at YOUR ass or are you so dainty that you haven’t noticed?” Mel says.\n“Yes, I’ve noticed that I’ve been attracting a lot of attention. I can’t really help that though, all I’m just trying to do is assess the situation here and if it’s worth staying or not. So are you in charge here now?”\n“Well considering the old bastard that owned this place got his fucking head blown off during the firefight, we are now officially free of any sort of authority whatsoever. However, since I’m only one that realizes what we just did was fucking treason to the highest degree even if it was necessary, I suppose I’m charge of trying to get us all out of this shitstorm. My first goal is to try to get rid of all traces that these soldier boys were even here and attempt to barricade this place somewhat. To be honest though, with all the shit that I’ve been hearing on the news and from what Tina told me yesterday, sounds like the whole world is going to shit and I doubt the government is even going to investigate one shitty little trailer park right away. Assuming if there even IS a government left after all this is over.”\n“So you really think this place will be safe?”\n“Fuck if I know. Probably safer than what’s going on in town right now. All I know is I ain’t running from my home unless I really have to. Look darlin’ I ain’t got the answers for ya as to whether or not you should leave. That’s on you. All I CAN say is I hope you’ve got some sort of useful skill if you intend on stickin’ around because if you HOPE to remain semi-independent and not sucking dick for supper, you’re going to have to pull your weight around here in a meaningful way. Well either that or hook up with one of many fine bachelors round here.”\n\nAt this point Mel smirks and raises his hand towards the many slovenly looking guys walking around as if he’s presenting them like they’re a prize on a game show. Except none of them are prizes and this isn’t a game show.\n\nYou desperately think about your skills and unpredictably you find them lacking, however you do think of one thing that you haven’t done or even thought about in years.\n\n“Well, my mom taught me how to sew when I was little. Haven’t done it in a long time though.”\n“Mm, seamstress might be useful, but can you do anything else?”\n“…uh…I killed a man. That’s gotta count for something.”\n“Mm, well in some places it might, but it isn’t like you’re the only killer here especially after today. Shit, some of these guys here probably killed before today anyway. But I suppose if worst came to worst, you COULD potentially help out as a guard in a pinch when we get all set up seeing as I know you have the capacity to kill something or someone threatening if need be. Lord, I can just imagine how all these fucktards will be wanting to be paired up with you though. (Sigh) Look seein’ as you’re a friend of Tina’s…”\n“Actually Tina’s my sister’s friend. I don’t think she really likes me at all.” You interrupt.\n“Well she’s going to like you even fucking less if she sees me speaking with you considering she’s a jealous type, but we’re getting off track. Fuck, what was I sayin’? Oh yeah, look since you’re the sister of Tina’s friend and don’t seem like a complete stuck up cunt, I’ll try to keep the boys from harassin’ you too much. Can’t speak for any of the ladies though. They’re probably going to hate you just as much as Tina…well except for Butchie Billie, who’ll probably be harassing you right along with the boys. I’m just glad Jed and his retarded giant ass brother aren’t here. I think those fuckers were rapists and they would’ve LOVED the likes of you. Anyway, now could you please fuckin’ leave so some work can get done?”\n\nAt this point you leave Mel and return to your trailer where you find Donna.\n\n“I thought you were scouting for a potential vehicle.” You say.\n“Apparently none of these hicks are leaving and neither is Tina. Nobody is willing to let me borrow one either.”\n“None? Didn’t you offer anything?” you ask hintingly.\n“Offer?...Oh yuck! Suzy! Seriously? Do you think I’m just that much of a whore?!” Donna asks.\n“Well I mean I know you’re free spirited enough not to give a shit about that sort of thing. I mean that IS how you got this trailer up front isn’t it?”\n“Okay, first that was different. Second that was REALLY unpleasant!”\n“Well you’ll be happy to know that old dude is dead now anyway. Mel seems to be in charge of this place now, or at least he alpha male here. Good thing you’re friends with Tina, he said he’d keep the sexual harassment to a minimum while we stay. He’s actually a lot smarter than he appears. He’s currently trying to eliminate all traces of the military being here and making this place more fortified.” You say.\n“So, where does that leave us?”\n“Well in the long term I don’t know. In the short term, we need to pull our weight around here to be useful. So far I’ve secured two possible jobs as a seamstress or a guard.”\n\nDonna looks a little surprised.\n\n“Seamstress huh? You talking about how mom taught you how to sew when we were little? Thought you hadn’t done it in a long time and didn’t care for it.”\n“I haven’t and I don’t, but I don’t relish the idea of blowing anyone here for food and water if things get bad. I’ll probably end up being a guard though. Seems a lot easier to potentially shoot people.”\n“Geez Suzy, you’re starting to sound like a completely different person.”\n“Yeah well a lot of shit has happened. Anyway, I’m done for today, I’m just going to relax for the rest of the night, since I’m guessing I’ll be doing a lot of work in the near future. It appears I’ve found a job at last, gotta love the irony.” You say.\n\nThe remainder of the night is fairly uneventful if somewhat noisy at times. Donna doesn’t say too much to you and eventually goes to bed, but she once again thanks you for saving her from that soldier. The pair of you bailing each other out of trouble seems to be a reoccurring theme this week.\n\nYou can only hope it isn’t a necessary theme tomorrow.\n",
  "page 5": "If you’re going to do this, you need to be all in right now. You feel slightly bad about essentially stealing Peter’s car, but you figure you can call him later and he can get someone to drive him over to pick it up. (Assuming he doesn’t call you first)\n\nAs for Bobby you’re not going to bother. You’ve come to the conclusion that you and he have too many differences to make it work and that this final break up has been a long time coming. Calling him would just make you fall for his charms and hinder your own goals and you can’t have that happen.\n\n“Mr. Roofie, I’ll be staying.” You say.\n“Okay, great. We’ll be opening up soon, dunno if anyone’s actually going to show up, but you might as well get out there and wander around to make this place look festive.”\n“Did you want me to change, you said something about this outfit being too much?”\n“Eh…don’t bother. I’m thinkin’ it’s an appropriate look for you. Like I said, you might have to put up with some cat calling from some of the cruder employees here, but that’s about it. And if anyone starts getting out of line with you, be they carnie or rube, let me know about it. Trust me it’ll be taken care of immediately. This carnival might be on its last legs, but I’ll be damned if it’ll descend into anarchy. My dad didn’t work and sacrifice all those years for nothing.” Roofie says.\n“Your dad owned this carnival? Was he a clown too?” you ask.\n“Heh, no. He was a geek and I don’t mean in the lovable nerd sense either. I mean he was a bonafide circus geek. Ate all manner of disgusting things to bring in the customers. Raw animal organs, heads of chickens, rotten food, you name it. He always told me though he was drunk most of the time so it wasn’t quite as bad as you’d think. Fortunately he didn’t stay a circus geek though. Apparently he helped the original ringmaster with something very important and after that happened my dad got a better job around here as the ringmaster’s assistant.”\n“What did he help the ringmaster with?”\n“Dunno exactly. Like I said, my dad was drinking a lot heavier during those geek days. He said it had to do with a power struggle within the circus, but he couldn’t quite remember all the details. In any event when the original ring master one day decided it was time to move on to something else my dad got control of the circus. Kept it going too despite the changing times. I’ve tried to follow in his footsteps, but so far the only thing I’ve succeeded at is the drinking part.”\n\nRoofie takes a drink from a nearby bottle after this statement.\n\n“So, uh what made you become a clown?” you ask.\n“I dunno, I was trying to help out I guess. Y’see my dad had to raise me himself since my mom died giving birth to me and I guess when I got old enough I felt I should contribute for all the extra burden I put on him.”\n“Sorry to hear that.”\n“Hm, well all I know about her is that she was a runaway that joined up with the circus shortly after my dad took over as owner. Anyway, for a while, this circus didn’t have a single clown. Apparently it did a long time ago, but my dad said there were some horror stories about them and they were eventually…let go. Despite this circus’ odd apprehension about having clowns again I convinced my dad that it would be a good idea to have clowns. So he gave me a shot and it worked. Rest is history, anyway that’s enough story time you’ve got your own clown work to do, so get to it.”\n\nYou take your leave and re-assure that you’ll do everything in your power to keep people entertained.\n\nNo sooner have you left Roofie’s tent when you’re nabbed by a couple of the other clowns, this time they’re full clown uniform.\n\n“Hey tulip we’ve been lookin’ for ya. If you’re staying, we’re going to need to polish up our routine.” One of them says.\n“Yeah, and after that, you can polish something else. Ha ha ha ha ha!” says another which causes some snickering from the others.\n“Could you please not talk that way to me?” you ask politely.\n“Awww are you sensitive? You’re such a delicate pretty little flower aren’t you?” the clown who made the polishing comment says.\n“Sheesh, Ranko don’t be a fucking asshole. Don’t mind him sweetheart he’s never been this close to a woman before.” Another clown says.\n“Fuck you Klepto and stop playing white knight. You’re not foolin’ anyone. You know damn well you got a raging boner for this little blonde number too. Am I right fellas?”\n\nThis gets a small positive acknowledgement by the other clowns, including Klepto who chuckles while confessing his transparent white knighting. Once again you’re starting to wonder if this is going to be worth it.\n\nIs this what its always going to be like? You haven’t even been officially an employee five minutes and you’re already getting subjected to dirty innuendo and harassment. You know Roofie tried to assure you that nothing is going happen and that if someone did try anything you could let him know, but really though you don’t want to have to feel like you have to go running to him like a tattletale every time.\n\nIf you could brave your serial killer uncle and your cultist ex-boyfriend, you can certainly handle some loutish clowns. In fact you start thinking about all the times Kelly has verbally abused you and you begin to get angry. You channel some of that anger that you have for her and direct it towards your new co-workers.\n\n“Ranko, I’m guessing that’s your name due to the bad breath your giving off right now. It smells like shit which still makes it about two steps higher than you look.” You say, which catches him off guard and stops the others from laughing. Before Ranko can retort you continue.\n\n“Your name oughta be Zero, because that’s exactly how far you’re ever going to get with me. The same goes for the rest of you fucktards! Just because I’m new here doesn’t mean I’m just going to take your fucking abuse!”\n\nFor a moment there’s silence and even some of the nearby employees look on wondering what the rest a going to do. Ranko is the only one who says anything though.\n\n“Hmm, looks like the delicate flower has a few thorns. That’s okay though. I like a little spirit, keeps things interesting. In any case we still need to go over the routine so if you’re done bitching at all of us, let’s go.” He says and motions everyone to follow.\n\nYou’re slightly apprehensive about following this group anywhere, but there’s little else for it since these are going to be your coworkers. You can only hope that in time they’ll see you as something other than an outlet for their lust.\n\nAs you walk to the location you scan the rest of the carnival, which mostly consists of a lot of game barker types setting up their crooked games. You do see a few stages where the more traditional sword swallower and fire eater types are preparing themselves. This being a circus and the fact that Roofie said his father was a geek, you can’t help but wonder if there are any “freaks” anywhere.\n\n“Hey just wondering are their any Siamese Twins around here or something?” you ask trying to break up the silence.\n“Siamese Twins? Way to be racist darlin’. Ha ha, nah just fuckin’ with ya, but I believe the correct term is conjoined twins and no we don’t have any. There haven’t been any freaks in this carnival for decades now. I heard back in the day there were a lot of them here though. Cyclopes, pinheads, four arms abominations of nature, you name it.” Ranko remarks.\n“How come there aren’t any here anymore?”\n“Well because we live in a developed country that has access to modern medicine nowadays? I mean most of those freaks were just unlucky bastards that rolled low on the genetics chart when they were born. Thanks to modern medicine they can correct that shit now y’know? Plus you’ve got all those politically correct types going on about exploitation or some shit. Also if someone IS a genetic freak of nature they can just go on a talk show or the Internet and make money that way. Nope, the time of the sideshow freak has long since passed. I mean sure you get the self made freaks like tattooed and pierced folks, but that’s not really the same and it isn’t even shocking anymore especially when you’ve got people cutting their dicks off or shoving glass jars up their ass for free on the net. The best you’re going to get around here to freaks are the midgets and they’re a dime a dozen, no offense Shrimpy.” Ranko says referring to the dwarf clown.\n“Fuck you too Ranko.” Shrimpy remarks.\n\nSoon you get to an open location near a couple trailers where Ranko says you’re all going to go through the routine. It’s pretty much like how you first went through it, but you notice several of the clowns are getting a little bit more grabby now.\n\n“Alright, stop, stop. You assholes are supposed to be trying to woo me and fighting with each other, not attempting to gang rape me! I feel one more hand trying to grab my ass and they’re losing it!” you say.\n“Oh for fuck’s sake according to you whatever we do is offensive. I’m just thinking of a way to keep the routine fresh. It’ll be funny!” Ranko says.\n“Fresh? We haven’t even performed it for people yet! Besides isn’t this supposed to be a family show? The way Roofie suggested will be fine.”\n“That old drunk doesn’t even perform anymore, he’s too busy running this carnival into the fucking ground. He’s so fucking out of touch its ridiculous. Kids these days are watching hardcore anal porn as soon as they can log on to the Internet nowadays, so I doubt if a couple of clowns grabbing your ass is even going to register.” Ranko says.\n\nAt this point Ranko is starting to get more hostile. Your continued defiance of not wanting to be a squeeze toy is getting to him. Despite Roofie being the owner, it’s obvious that this Ranko is the “ring leader” of the clowns and he’s going to be a dick no matter what. Continuing to antagonize his authority is going to just result in unifying the rest to his side, so you try something else.\n\n“All right Ranko, you want this routine to incorporate a little more risqué business fine, but you’re going about it the wrong way. You’ve got no style.”\n“Oh? Only been a clown for a few hours and you’re already an expert eh? Well go on and enlighten us all then sweetheart.”\n“Well for one thing Shrimpy should be trying to look under my dress whenever he can due to his size.” You say.\n“Wait what?” Ranko asks.\n“Hey, I’m liking her ideas already!” Shrimpy exclaims.\n“You all still need to play to your traits, don’t you see? You, Lifto. You’re the biggest of the lot so you should be relying on feats of strength in order to impress me like picking me up in your arms.”\n“Yeah, that makes sense.” Lifto remarks.\n\nYou go through what the rest of the clowns should be doing and they’re remarkably receptive to you and your ideas. You come up with a whole new routine where they each attempt to charm you and how they fail either due to their own ineptness or another clown sabotaging them. The only one who’s not liking this idea is Ranko.\n\n“Hey, hey, hey, what about me? Where do I fit in?” Ranko demands.\n“You? Well I figured you’d be that completely disgusting suitor that never even gets close to being charming seeing as you’re already pretty good in that role. You can be an ongoing participant that gets constantly beat down by the others. Lifto hits you with a mallet, Klepto steals your pants, Shrimpy gives you a hot foot…you know clown stuff. It’ll be funny.” You say snidely much to Ranko’s chagrin.\n“Oh no, you’re not turning my crew against me! I’M head clown around here not some bottle blonde split tail! We’re not agreeing to this shit!” Ranko shouts.\n“Speak for yourself Ranko.” Klepto says.\n“Yeah, I kinda like this idea better, my bit doesn’t seem to rely on as much movement on my part.” Fatty remarks.\n“You’re just pissed that a newbie took your idea and made it work against you.” Shrimpy adds.\n\nRanko at this point begins ranting and raving at everyone. He unleashed a torrent of swears that causes the whole carnival to take notice. He calls you a bitch and the rest of them pussy whipped.\n\n“That’s it, I’m done with this fucking loser carnival and the rest of you losers as well! I’m fucking RANKO the goddamn clown! I can get a job anywhere! Enjoy living in obscurity with miss frigid over here!” Ranko exclaims and storms off in a huff.\n\n“Good riddance rank breath! And I’m a goddamn natural blonde, you asshole!” you shout as he continues to walk away.\n\nYou have to say this plunge into assertiveness has given you a bit of a rush. You like it. When you go back to going through the routine with the others and you notice a decrease in your former uneasiness. The “boys” are still doing a lot of leering and the routine is a little more physical now, but something is different this time. Namely you feel more in control of the situation and that’s probably because you are.\n\n“Wow, I really was wasting my natural talent.” You think to yourself.\n\nIn the middle of the routine, Roofie shows up.\n\n“Well this looks…friendly.” He remarks as Lifto is in the middle of setting you back down on the ground.\n“Just going through the tweaked routine boss. It was the new girl’s idea!” Klepto remarks.\n“Yeah, it’s going to be good.” Shrimpy adds.\n“Hrm. Well let’s at least try to keep everyone’s clothing on shall we?”\n“Of course! There isn’t going to be any of that. Just going to keep it entertaining for the adult audience too.” You say.\n“Couldn’t help notice Ranko swearing like a sailor and stomping away from the carnival. Ranting about how he’s never coming back. You wouldn’t know anything about that would you?”\n“Not really boss. He just couldn’t keep up with the recent changes around here I guess.” You say,\n\nRoofie smirks a bit.\n\n“Heh, okay. Well I’m not going to lose any sleep not having to pay that asshole anymore. In any case, saw a few people actually driving up. Look like actual customers, so you guys need to go do your stuff for the crowds.”\n\nThe rest of the day goes pretty well for you. You and the rest entertain the small crowds (who seem to be mostly from the trailer park community just outside of your town.) that do show up.\n\nBy the end of the night you’re actually pretty tired and anxious to just flop down somewhere to sleep. Roofie says that thanks to Ranko leaving, his trailer is now empty and says that you can have it if you’re willing to ignore the mess he probably left it in. You accept the offer since it’ll be better than sleeping in Peter’s car.\n\nAnd its at that point you forgot to call Peter back to let him know to pick his car up!\nYou check your phone and see that Peter did indeed try to get a hold of you, and once again Bobby left a bunch of texts and messages as well. You’re too tired to even bother to read them.\n\nYou try to call Peter back, but you get no answer. Probably doing god knows what. You’ll try again tomorrow, for now you enter Ranko’s trailer and breathe a sigh of relief that the place isn’t a health hazard and lie down on his bed.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep you chuckle at the irony that Ranko wanted to get you into his bed really badly and all it took was for him to leave.\n",
  "page 144": "It isn’t going to be pleasant to leave, but Donna does make a good point about the foolishness of sticking around here after the massacre of military personnel.\n\n“Okay Donna, I guess maybe you’re right. I’ll pack and we’ll head out.”\n“Well maybe it won’t be completely hopeless. Maybe some of the others here will be leaving too, we might be able to go with them or catch a ride for awhile at least.”\n“Hm, I don’t hold out too much hope, but I’ll let you take care of that, just let me know when you’re ready to go, because I’m going to have to figure out what I need and can take with me without collapsing from exhaustion.”\n\nWhile you struggle with what clothing you can do without and what items you’re going to need, Donna finishes packing and leaves the trailer to presumably go charm a ride from someone.\n\nA half hour passes and Donna returns just as you’re finishing up packing and she doesn’t look in the best of spirits.\n\n“I take it, it didn’t go well?” you ask.\n“I can’t believe at least ONE of these rednecks isn’t so damn stupid to want to stay here! But no, everyone of these dumb fuckers are insisting on sticking around trying to make this place into a fortress or some shit.”\n“Not one fell for your charms?” you ask.\n“What are you getting at?”\n“Well I figured you were offering something in return…”\n““Offer?...Oh yuck! Suzy! Seriously? Do you think I’m just that much of a whore?!” Donna asks.\n“Well I mean I know you’re free spirited enough not to give a shit about that sort of thing. I mean that IS how you got this trailer up front isn’t it?”\n“Okay, first that was different. Second that was REALLY unpleasant! Anyway, looks like we’re walking. Even Tina wasn’t willing to help out.”\n“Hardly surprising. So which direction are we walking?” you ask.\n“What do you mean? There’s only one way to go. I mean you aren’t suggesting we head back to town do you?”\n“Well the other direction will eventually lead to Security City and I can’t imagine it’ll be any better there.” You say.\n“That’s still a very long way off Suzy, I mean maybe we can find refuge somewhere else first, like a truck stop or something.”\n“I just hope we aren’t rounded up by passing military on the road. Oh well I guess we’ll find out. At least we got a couple weapons from that asshole who tried to kill us earlier.” You say.\n\nAnd with those words, you and Donna leave the trailer, which was once to be your new home and make your way out of the park. Seems like ever since you left home, you’re doomed to not stay anywhere for very long. You hope this isn’t a sign of things to come.\n\nAs you leave, you see that Donna was right in that the park residents are indeed trying to barricade this place up by putting vehicles in strategic locations. You don’t see how such a plan can possibly stand up against a real attack by the military, but they’re determined not to be run off.\n\n“So you’re leaving Donna?” Tina asks on your way out.\n“Yeah, I don’t think this place is for me and my sister. You sure that you want to still stay here?”\n“No point in doing so yet. Besides, Mel is actually getting everyone’s ass in gear to prepare this place for more potential trouble. It’s the most motivated I’ve seen him in…well since he first sweet talked me into spreading my legs for him and that was ages ago. Really I dunno why y’all are leaving. It’s only going to be worse out there, but suit yerselves. Good luck I guess.” Tina says and leaves the pair of you.\n\nLeaving the trailer park behind, night has already begun to fall as you walk along side the road.\n\nTen minutes in and Donna breaks up the silence.\n\n“The road is pretty deserted. There hasn’t been any traffic in either direction since we started walking.” Donna says.\n“Hopefully it stays like that, seems like every time more people show up more problems crop up.” You answer.\n“Yeah, I guess it does seem that way. Bet you’re wishing you were in the basement right now.”\n“Got that right. No use wishing it was so though. Those carefree days are long gone now.”\n“Heh, as are my own carefree days of partying everyday. A few days ago I was just starting to think that maybe I had been wasting my life and needed it to get back on track to do something productive. Now? Looks like I didn’t waste anything seeing as the world appears to be going to shit.” Donna adds.\n\nYou agree and the pair of you continue walking. The stars are a lot brighter without the streetlights of the town around. You look up at them on several occasions never really admiring the “heavens” before. You get the impression even Donna is starting to admire them. Really until this walk, you’ve never really realized just how rural of an area you lived in before.\n\nHours pass and both of you are tired, not just from the walking though, it was an “action packed” day earlier for the pair of you after all. In the far distance though you see the shape of what looks to be several structures.\n\n“Hey Donna, looks like something is up ahead. It’s really dark, but I think those are tents or something.” You say.\n“Yeah, wonder what that is.” Donna says.\n“Maybe we should hang back until morning.” You say.\n“Why?”\n“Because who knows who the hell is over there. I mean maybe that’s a military encampment. We go walking in, and soldiers could suddenly surround us. Or worse, they see us stumbling in the darkness and shoot us on sight believing we’re intruders. Both of us are pretty tired anyway, I think it would be best if we approached this with clear eyes and in the daytime.” You say.\n“Hm, okay you might be right about that. Where are we sleeping though?”\n“Looks like the great outdoors. Come on let’s get off the side of the road. We don’t need someone running us over in our sleep.\n\nYou and Donna head off the road and deeper into wilderness, though not too much. You try to find a spot that seems “good” and then you realize you’re in the damn wilderness without even a sleeping bag, there is no where to sleep that’s going to be “good.”\n\n“Well I guess here will do. Use your back pack as a pillow and try to get comfy.” You say laying down.\n“Ugh, I can only imagine the things that are going to be crawling on me in the night.” Donna says.\n“Yeah, things suck all over. Hey why are you getting so close?”\n“You got both weapons! I’m not sleeping too far from you. Besides, it’s fucking cold out here. We’ll stay warmer if we sleep near each other. Did that with Julie once when her heating system was broken for a week.”\n“Yeah, well you better not start cuddling or worse grinding on me.”\n“Geez Suzy, that’s sick! You’re my sister for fuck’s sake.”\n“Good, glad we understand each other.”\n\nAs you attempt to get as comfortable as possible Donna keeps moving so she’s partially touching you, despite the fact you’re trying to keep apart. Eventually you give up and just try to focus on sleeping.\n\n“Suzy?” Donna says.\n“What?” You answer.\n“I’m glad we left and are seeing this through together.” Donna says in such a way that you haven’t heard her speak before. Almost like a little kid.\n\n“Yeah, I’m glad we’re seeing this through together too.” You say.\n\nAnd with those words, you drift off.\n",
  "page 265": "You’re going to be at a severe disadvantage if you run away, better to just get this over with and if you die today, then you die.\n\nIgnoring any pain you might still have with your ankle, you sprint for the shotgun. Jed at this point doesn’t bother pants anymore and goes to grab the shotgun. Seeing that he’ll easily beat you to it, you throw the machete at him.\n\nIt’s enough to cause him to jump and stumble when he thinks it’s going to hit him, which is enough time to grab the shotgun, unfortunately just not enough time to shoot Jed with it.\n\n“Fuckin’ bitch!” Jed says and elbows you in the side of the head. You try to hang on to the shotgun, but he manages to pull it away from you and then kicks you to the ground.\n\nYou hear a racking sound of the shotgun and you don’t look up. While you’re certainly scared, you’re angrier that you failed more than anything else.\n\n“I remember you…you were Miss sick weren’t you? You don’t seem so sick now. In fact you don’t even seem like the crazies in town. Guess you had a big laugh about pullin’ one over on me huh? LOOK AT ME!”\n\nYou look up, but maintain a defiant look in your eye as Jed continues to point his shotgun at you.\n\n“Oh. Still the tough bitch huh? Well it don’t mean shit and it ain’t gonna change shit. Tell ya what though, I didn’t get to finish up with my current girlfriend over there and as you can see my dick’s still hard. Suck me off like the whore you are and MAYBE you might get a quick death.” Jed says.\n\nYou take a brief look at Jed’s filthy dick and look back up and smile.\n\n“Jed, you better just shove that shotgun barrel in my face and pull the trigger because that’s the only thing you’re getting in my mouth and blowing a load in. It would at least be a lot more spectacular than what’s actually between your legs.”\n\nJed’s face nearly becomes red with rage.\n\n“Yer gonna WISH I blew your head off, you cunt!” Jed says and he pulls the shotgun up and then flips it around to use the butt of it smash you in the head. He’s not quite quick enough though since you manage to shield your face with your hands. Still it’s enough to knock you back to the ground in pain.\n\n“Where the fuck is that machete.” Jed says and grabs it from the ground before approaching you with it one hand and still holding the shotgun in the other.\n\n“Been awhile since I fucked an amputee, guess we’ll see if I can cum before you bleed out…”\n\nJed in his haste to “teach you a lesson” has completely ignored the fact that he is no longer restraining the crazy woman he was violating. You see the thing recover and get up from it’s previous vulnerable position.\n\n“You sure you want to do this Jed? Think your girlfriend is jealous.” You say.\n“Wha…AGH!” Jed says and turns just in time for the crazed townie to bite Jed between the neck and shoulder.\n\nHe drops the shotgun and swings the machete in an attempt to kill the rabid woman. While they struggle you scramble and grab the shotgun.\n\nJed manages to fight off the rabid woman and finishes her off with a chop to her neck.\n\n“Aww, I was rooting for her.” You say.\n\nJed turns around and sees you pointing the shotgun at him. He doesn’t look scared.\n\n“What, you think I’m scared because you’re pointing a gun at me? Ain’t the first time I’ve had one pointed at me blondie.” He says.\n“Heh, blondie now is it? Not whore, bitch, cunt, or whatever other unimaginative name you’ve called me before? I may not have been doing this as long as you have, but it seems like someone is scared.”\n“Pfft, you don’t even know how to use that thing, the fucking safety is on you dumb bitch.”\n\nYou pull the trigger and literally blow his balls off. The kickback hurts your arm, but it’s a lot less pain than what you imagine Jed is feeling right now.\n\nJed howls on the ground in agony and you walk over near him.\n\n“Did you actually expect I was going to fall for that like in a movie? Get me to check like an idiot and give you just enough time to possibly rush me? I just heard you rack this fucking shotgun not a few seconds ago. Not to mention with the time you spent playing with rabid girl over there, I would have had more than enough time to take the safety off and that’s even if this particular shotgun HAD a safety feature on it to begin with which it doesn’t!” You say.\n\nJed just looks at you with a mixture of pain and disbelief that you would even know that much about a gun.\n\n“I know, brains and beauty. It’s a curse sometimes, but after this week I’m starting to get the hang of it.” You say and blast Jed into oblivion.\n\nThe first thing you do is keep an eye on your immediate surroundings. You, Jed and crazy woman made a hell of a lot of noise. Who knows what the hell might have been attracted. Not to mention the last thing you need is Hugo to have heard all of this and come running out. You seem to be okay for now though.\n\nThe second thing you do is search Jed’s body or what’s left of it for keys to the truck. It’s a gory mess and the only thing you succeed in doing is getting your hands bloody. You do remember seeing Hugo getting out of the driver’s side, so you imagine he’s probably the one that has them.\n\n“Well, he was going to be next anyway.” you say and head back towards the house.\n\nOnce again you enter the house with caution. You get the feeling Hugo didn’t hear anything outside or if he did, he’s too pre-occupied with shit in the basement. Come to think of it, you haven’t heard another blast and you know there are at least two more of those things down there, then again you’ve been a little pre-occupied as well.\n\nYou make your way to the stairs leading to the basement. You aren’t hearing anything at all, which makes all the more scary.\n\n“Made it this far by yourself Suzy, you can finish this…” you say and descend.\n\nYou get to the bottom floor of the basement and just looking down the corridor, you see several of the doors are open. No sign of Hugo or the “patients” though.\n\nYou head down the corridor fully ready for anything about to leap out at you. You look into the first room with the door open and see nothing. In fact, this is your old room.\n\nThe next two rooms obviously housed “patients.” One of those patients is laying dead face down half in the doorway. The other is still in his room and hadn’t even broken his restraints.\n\nYou notice the next room is empty, but the door looks like it was broken open from the inside. It would seem these rooms weren’t as secure as Lilith thought. It is at this point you notice splatters of blood all over the floor and a trail of it leading to the last open door which again looks broken from the outside.\n\nYou slowly peek around the corner.\n\nThere you see one of the patients lying near the entryway with his head twisted all the way around and blood around his mouth. His teeth are clenched in a creepy death grin and you also notice the remnants of a couple fingers still gripped in it.\n\nIt would appear Hugo didn’t get a chance to shoot this one.\n\nAnother patient lies further in the room with its brains bashed into the floor. It also has blood around it’s mouth and in this case nails too.\n\nFinally you see Hugo sitting up against a wall with his shotgun nearby on the floor. He doesn’t look so great though. He’s clearly wounded very badly. It looks like he’s holding his stomach, which he is bleeding out of and you already know he’s lost some fingers.\n\nWhen he looks up at you. He doesn’t even go for his gun, he just stares…with one eye. He apparently lost one of those too.\n\n“HUGO HURT BAD.” He says.\n\nEither he doesn’t recognize you, he doesn’t think you’re a threat, or is too concerned about his injuries.\n\n“Yeah, doesn’t look too good.” You answer, Hugo still makes no move to the shotgun despite you walking in.\n“YOU THE SICK PRETTY LADY.” Hugo says finally recognizing you.\n“Yeah, well I got better.”\n“DOC CAN MAKE HUGO BETTER.”\n“Doc’s not here.”\n\nHugo at this point winces in pain and coughs up some blood.\n\nHugo is just a retard; he probably doesn’t even know he does bad things. You imagine his brother Jed has been manipulating him all his life.\n\nIt might even be tragic under normal circumstances.\n\n“YOU SEE JED? JED MAKE HUGO BETTER.”\n“Sure I’ve seen him, I’ll take you to him.”\n\nYou point the shotgun at Hugo who doesn’t even really realize the gravity of the situation and with a mixture of avenging angel and angel of mercy you pull the trigger and put Hugo out of his misery.\n\nProbably quicker than he deserved, but it got the job done.\n\nYou exit the room feeling a bit drained. You weren’t really expecting to do all this the first thing you got up this morning, but you handled it about as well as you could have.\n\nIt’s amazing how much someone can change and what they’re capable of within just a few days. You just killed two people this time and granted they deserved it, you still feel a little weird that you aren’t sick about it or something. Maybe Lilith was right. Maybe you are capable of great violence without a second thought.\n\nThe jury is still out on that since as far you’re concerned you haven’t killed any innocent people, just two people who fucked with you. In any case you’re a far cry from that “good girl” who hid in the basement.\n\nSpeaking of basements, you decide to check out the rest of this one since you’re down here. You don’t find much though except one large room that is obviously where Leslie did all his “experiments.” Looks like he took most of his stuff and left a couple of dead bodies on his table behind. You don’t really stay long due to the smell, which is pretty awful.\n\nYou leave the basement with a second shotgun and Hugo’s truck keys.\n\nYou spend the rest of the day looting the house for any potential worthwhile items. The Morningstars left surprisingly a lot of every useful items behind, but then again they’re going to be in a nice safe shelter so there really wasn’t any need you suppose.\n\nYou pack what bags you can find full of stuff until you feel you have enough. After doing that you take a break to wash up again and eat. You grab something out of the fridge that looks like lasagna.\n\nIt doesn’t taste like any lasagna you’ve ever had, but then again you’ve only ever eaten the microwavable kind, so that might be why it tastes a hell of a lot better. Leslie might’ve been a horrible human being, but damn if he wasn’t a good cook.\n\nAs the sun starts to go down, you wonder if you should leave or stay one more night and leave in the morning. You ultimately decide now that you’re a lot better armed, you can probably afford to stay one more night. You don’t know if you’ll get to sleep on a proper bed again.\n\nOnce again you take all the proper precautions of securing the house as much as you can and once again end with pushing the dresser to block the door of the bedroom before turning in to sleep.\n\nA little less reluctantly this time given that you have two shotguns and as well as a machete for protection now.\n",
  "page 8": "TUESDAY\n\n\n“…remember time is running out! Our shelters won’t be…”\n\nYou wake up to instinctively to grab the remote to turn off the TV only to realize that you have no TV, yet you’re still hearing those damn Ground Zero commercials.\n\nYou groggily sit up and look out a side window and see one of the carnies holding a radio, which is loudly playing one of those advertisements.\n\nJust as well you’re up anyway, now that you have actual responsibilities and will have to live these new people you should take this opportunity to meet everyone since despite getting acquainted with your co-workers and the boss, you didn’t really interact with anyone else working here.\n\nStill dressed in your outfit from yesterday (mainly because you lack anything else to wear right now) you go out and meet your brand new family full of hope that this will be the start of something wonderful!\n\nThe reality turns out to be much different though.\n\n“Honey, why the hell are hanging around with those clowns? I’m sure you’d be better as a sword swallower; in fact I got a way you can practice if you come to my trailer right now!”\n“Hey clown girl, I’ve got a way to paint your face white without the need for make up!”\n“Nice tits!”\n\nThe female carnies aren’t much better.\n\n“So you’re the new girl that got her own private trailer huh? Guess a blowjob gets you a lot preference nowadays. Was Roofie even sober at the time?”\n“Hey Bozo the Hoe, you think you’re hot shit wiggling your ass at everyone? Let me warn you right now, you take my man I’ll make sure you won’t need to wear a red clown nose at your next performance!”\n“No, I don’t have any extra clothes you can borrow, Miss Living Skeleton. Go away you anorexic bitch.”\n\nLife is never easy outside the basement is it Suzy?\n\nUnfortunately that part of your life is over. You could go back to your trailer and hide you suppose, but it’s not the same and besides you’ve already come to the conclusion that hiding won’t solve your problems.\n\nStill, you are feeling a little “ganged up” on so for temporary relief you return to currently the only people that are halfway decent to you now, your fellow clowns.\n\nYou enter the clown tent and see them all sitting around talking about something, but then when you enter all their attention is turned towards you.\n\n“Oh hey Suzy, you’re here early. We don’t usually warm up until a few hours before showtime.” Klepto remarks.\n“Oh, I’m not here for that, I’m just here since half of the carnival seems to want to fuck me and barrage me with clumsy sexual innuendo.“\n“And… you came here to get away from that?” Lifto asks.\n\nYou chuckle a little.\n\n“Yeah well at least if I stay in here part of it will be work related.” You answer which causes a couple of laughs and smiles from the rest.\n“Well considering you are one of us, maybe we should go easier on that now.” Klepto says.\n“I’d certainly appreciate it.”\n“Hey there are a lot of other women who work here, maybe you could go bond with them and do that whole sisterhood thing?” Lifto says.\n“I tried that. They all insulted me and seemed to want to punch me. Well except for that woman with the short red hair that juggles knives. I think she wanted to punch AND fuck me. (Sigh) No, looks like you guys are my only tribe here for now.”\n“Hm, well get used to it I guess. Nobody likes us clowns that much. To be quite honest one of the reasons we decided to knock off the crude remarks toward you is because you’ll be the first new person in years that will be civil to us. No point in making new enemies.” Klepto says.\n“Really? I thought all carnies stuck together.” You say.\n\nNow all the rest of the clowns laugh.\n\n“Hardly. I mean yeah there’s a certain unspoken rule that carnies stay united against outsiders and rubes. And we aren’t supposed to kill one another, but…well lets just say this very carnival doesn’t exactly have a spotless track record in that regard.” Klepto says.\n“People kill each other here?” you ask a bit alarmed.\n“No! Well not in my time anyway…” Klepto remarks trailing off.\n“What the hell does that mean? Look I don’t want to be part of some murder circus!”\n“Damn it Klepto you’ve scared the girl now! You should’ve just kept your mouth shut!” Shrimpy exclaims.\n\nAt this point the clowns begin arguing with each other, but after a few moments of this bickering you demand that someone explain the situation exactly. Once again Klepto takes it upon himself to be the storyteller.\n\n“Look, I’ve probably blown it all out of proportion, but there are stories of how back in the day before Roofie or even his dad owned this carnival there was a violent power struggle for control over it that resulted in a lot of dead bodies afterwards.”\n“Weren’t just stories, shit it happened! My family has been a fixture of this carnival for generations too and my grandfather told me about the blood that ran during that fateful day.” Shrimpy adds as if Klepto didn’t quite put as much stock in these stories and takes over as the storyteller.\n\n“Battle lines were drawn that day. I mean you had dwarves, normals and freaks all siding against each other and the most hated group out of the bunch? The clowns. Now from what my grandfather told me, these clowns were definitely the reason why everyone today thinks of them as being monsters under the beds nowadays. Things of course have changed since then, but as they say the more things change the more they stay the same.”\n“What do you mean?” you ask.\n“I’m saying there’s going to be another power struggle soon and given that we’re clowns, WE are going to be on the losing end no matter what happens”\n“Wait a minute, what about Roofie? I mean isn’t he one of us?” you ask.\n“Roofie? The fact that he’s a clown just makes everyone think we already get preferential treatment. He’ll probably be the first one killed being the owner and all. He’s old and doesn’t have nearly the amount of control he used to anymore. Nope, I believe the change will be coming soon and it’ll be truly be a dark day for clowns…well maybe I’ll be able to get my people to take me back and YOU can offer to be someone’s girlfriend, but the rest of you are fucked.”\n“Gee, glad to know we’ll be able to count on your support Shrimpy, if something does happen.” Klepto remarks.\n\nYou never realized that carnie “politics” was so complex and dangerous. Before you can panic too much about it Roofie shows up with a bottle in his hand.\n\n“Hey, what’re you lot still doing in here? We’ve actually got people showing up early. Apparently your little routine yesterday got people at that trailer park talking and they brought all the rest of their redneck buddies. Looks like we’ll get to rake in one goodly amount of cash before leaving this place. Oh and Suzy, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the car you drove up in? Well looks like it was vandalized in the night.”\n“What?!” you exclaim.\n“All the tires were slashed and someone wrote cunt all over it with face make up. It might be just a hunch, but I’d say Ranko felt like he needed to have to last word.”\n“(Sigh) Great.” You say.\n“Well anyway you all need to get out there and do what you do.” Roofie orders and leaves.\n\nWhile the rest get going, you remain sitting starting to worry about what you’ve got yourself into. Once again you start to wonder if you shouldn’t just leave until Klepto touches your shoulder.\n\n“Don’t worry Suzy, Shrimpy has been going on like that for as long as I’ve known him. While things get tense around here at times, I don’t think it’s going to come to some bloodbath. Besides you can’t spend your life worrying about the future, gotta live for the day I say, so let’s just take our minds off our troubles by putting on a good show.” Klepto remarks.\n\nWhile Klepto’s reassurance is nice, it doesn’t really alleviate your concerns. Hell, you can’t even leave if you wanted to given that Peter’s car is trashed. You can only hope that perhaps in time peoples’ attitudes towards you will soften a bit. Right now, you do have work to focus on.\n\nRoofie wasn’t lying when he said more people showed up today. You and the rest of the clowns spend a majority of the afternoon walking around keeping the people entertained\n\nEventually you take a break and decide to check out Peter’s car and if it is at all salvageable. When you get to it, it’s exactly as Roofie said, all four tires slashed and the word cunt painted all over it. You can’t believe nobody saw any of this even during the night. Or maybe they did and didn’t give a shit considering you haven’t exactly been accepted by most here.\n\nIn any event you try to call Peter again, but you get no answer. He hasn’t even tried to call you. He must really be involved with work or something. Or maybe he doesn’t give a shit about his car. He could easily afford a new one. You also notice Bobby hasn’t tried calling you either. You guess he got the hint.\n\nYou attempt to start to the car and just as you suspected Ranko must’ve sabotaged the engine or something under the hood as well. No matter, when you leave you weren’t going to be driving this thing anymore anyway. Lacking anymore use for the car, you take a look in the trunk just to see what might be in there and that’s when you find something useful. Namely a bunch of clothes…specifically YOUR clothes! Well some of them anyway.\n\nApparently Peter still had a lot of your old clothes that he stole from you in the past. The other stuff looks like S\u0026M garb, though not all of it the traditional black leather or latex. Some of it is sort of colorful. Festive even.\n\nWell at least you won’t be walking around in the same stuff day in day out now. You pack up what you can and head back to your trailer to drop it off. Afterwards you find the rest of your new clown “family” and eat with them. You take the opportunity to tell them a little bit about your former life; you get a surprising amount of sympathy from the others.\n\n“Holy shit, I thought I came from a fucked up family.” Klepto remarks.\n“Yeah well, like I said I did a lot of hiding in the basement for the most part. Not much of a life I guess, but it kept me sane for the most part.” You say.\n“Hey, whatever helps you survive the day right?” Shrimpy says.\n\nAfter a bit more chatting you all get back to work.\n\nAs time goes on, there is one person you keep seeing nearby throughout the day, a large man in overalls who while attempting to look like he’s NOT staring at you, obviously is. This isn’t the usual ogling either because you’ve gotten accustomed to that, you’re getting a really creepy vibe from this guy.\n\n“Maybe we should get Roofie to throw this guy out or something.” You say.\n“Roofie? I just passed by one of the tents when I got another snack and saw he’s currently passed out as usual. Besides, he never throws anyone out as long as they aren’t doing something violent. As far a he’s concerned every low life that visits this carnival is a potential mark and worth putting up with to get their money.” Fatty says.\n“The guy looks like a retard. He’s probably not used to seeing a girl as beautiful as you before. I mean even under the white face make up and clown clothing, you still look miles better than any of the trailer trash mothers that have come here with their spawn.” Shrimpy remarks.\n“Well he’s really fucking creepy and I don’t trust him.” You say.\n“He’s not going to do anything in broad daylight, and even if he does, you know we got your back. Just stick near us and Lifto look extra intimidating.” Klepto says.\n\nThe night the crowds start thinning out a bit. You imagine that after they put their illegitimate spawn to bed, trailer trash prefers to spend their nights at bars, strip clubs and getting high and/or drunk at home. As for the big retard that was staring at you all day, he seems to have left as well, but you still feel uneasy.\n\nMeanwhile Roofie has reawakened from his temporary drunken stupor to tell everyone that today was a good day and that everyone should get some rest since you’re going to be packing this place down first thing tomorrow morning and moving on. He then mumbles something about it all being pointless anyway and staggers back to his own trailer.\n\n“Well looks like that’s it. See you tomorrow Suzy.” Klepto remarks as he and the rest head towards their trailer.\n\nYou on the other hand are still a little nervous about going back to yours.\n\n“Uh, guys do you think I could sleep with you tonight?” you say which causes all of them to turn back towards you in disbelief.\n“Wow Ranko would have had a field day with that remark.” Klepto chuckles. “You know probably nothing is going to happen. That guy was just some goony retard. Hell, if the freak show still existed, he’d probably be one of the side shows here.”\n“Look, I’m just still feeling really on edge about that guy from earlier. I mean I could sleep on the floor, I don’t care.” You say.\n“That would be incredibly uncomfortable and probably quite disgusting. Our trailer isn’t exactly the cleanest. I mean I’d offer my bed, but given that we’re going to need all our energy to pack up tomorrow, I’d like to get a good night’s sleep.” Klepto remarks.\n\n“Why don’t I sleep over in your trailer?” Lifto asks. “I know Ranko’s trailer is big enough for one other person. I could stay over, you guys would get a little extra room tonight and you can sleep safely without worry.”\n“Hrmm, that’s…generous of you Lifto.” Klepto remarks.\n“It’s not like that, I’m just offering a solution.” Lifto says though it does seem like he might be hoping this act of chivalry will lead to something more.\n\nWhile you’d hate to cause hard feelings within the group or possibly lead someone on, you know one thing is certain; you still don’t want to sleep alone tonight.\n",
  "page 268": "Love SICK Too\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“You know how mutants are dear, they act on impulse sometimes.” You say as you sew up a shirt.\n“Yes, I get that, but I specifically told my congregation NOT to attack Iron Union transports! Last thing we need is the GZ corporation sniffing around this town asking questions. I’m just glad I managed to convince them to clean up the mess, even if some of them were bitching the entire time.” Bobby exclaims.\n“Hm, well you are very persuasive when you want to be. Guess that’s why they listen to you at all.”\n\nBobby just sits down in a nearby chair continuing to rant about the troubles with his “congregation.” You’ve heard the complaints before several times and really this is just a normal routine for you both. Bobby complains and you listen to his troubles. Just part of married life you suppose.\n\nMaking adjustments to accommodate your significant other’s desires is another part of married life.\n\nBobby may have very well left his “religion” behind, but the cult leader part of him never really left him. You’re not even exactly sure what “higher power” Bobby believes in now, if he does at all. Personally you think he just made up some shit and managed to convince a bunch of mutants to follow him. Not that you really care. He’s bringing in the loot with his little band of brainwashed mutants and it provides him with a sense of fulfillment, despite the fact he’s doing a lot of complaining right now.\n\n“Bobby, you’re worrying too much again. I’m sure your minions aren’t the only mutants living in this town that have attacked Iron Union transports. Besides, last I heard the Iron Union is in the middle of a civil war. So even if they did find out, I doubt if they’ve even got the firepower to launch an attack on a place that has the reputation of being a large and extremely dangerous mutant town.” You say.\n“Heh, well they certainly got less now. There were some nice weapons in that transport.” Bobby chuckles.\n“See? Just gotta look on the bright side of things.” You say.\n\nMaintaining an optimistic mindset certainly came in handy during those early years when it was just you and Bobby surviving on the road, drifting from place to place. Not that it was all-bad and some of it was even fun, but you and Bobby were never truly happier when you finally managed to lay down roots here in Emberville.\n\nYou, of course for the reasons of comfort and security. Bobby of course still wanted a family. He had you of course, but you know deep down he still wanted to have children with you.\n\nWhich also became another adjustment, but really not one you were so resistant about anymore. You just needed time like you said and eventually you felt it was the right time.\n\n“Alexander! Your shirt is done!” you shout.\n\nYour son comes in from his room. Normally he’s out playing, but there are times where he just shuts himself away and reads whatever books Bobby or you find for him. It’s good that he has a variety of interests.\n\n“Hey this looks as good as new.” He exclaims.\n“I doubt that, but I did the best I could with what I had.”\n“Where did you learn to sew Mom?” Alexander asks.\n“Oh, my mother taught me when I was little. Never thought I’d actually ever take it up again though, but in this sort of world, it’s sort of a handy skill to have.”\n“Hey how come you never told me about that little interesting tidbit about your life when we were first going out? I remember being surprised when you told me you had seamstress skills” Bobby asks.\n“Like I said, I never thought it was important until this whole world went to shit and sewing up clothes was something I had to actually do more frequently.” You answer.\n\n“Did she teach you how to cook too?” Alexander asks\n“Hah, no. I didn’t learn how to do that until much later in life and I taught myself mostly.” You say.\n“Your mother is misremembering things again. She actually learned a lot from Mrs. Zerul down the street. Before we moved here, your mother’s cooking probably nearly killed me more times than gunfire.” Bobby jokes, which gets him a glare.\n“Hey, there were several times that we didn’t starve thanks to me.” You snap.\n\n“Well I think you’re a good cook Mom.” Alexander remarks.\n“Thanks son, at least someone here appreciates me. Now go out and play and try not to ruin the shirt you’re currently wearing. Especially if you play with that Jenny girl.”\n“Who’s Jenny?” Bobby asks, not knowing all of his son’s friends as usual.\n“Jenny is a cute little mutant girl with talons instead of normal nails. Last time they were playing and Alexander came home with a shirt that was beyond my sewing skills.”\n“You sure they were just playing?” Bobby asks.\n“Bobby!” you say.\n“Hey, kids grow up fast without traditional social norms!” Bobby says.\n“And what exactly would YOU even know what traditional social norms are?” you ask.\n“…well I do know what they were even if I didn’t actually practice them. In fact I’d say I’m a living example of what happens to a child growing up without traditional social norms.” Bobby replies.\n\nAlexander isn’t quite sure what you and Bobby going on about, but speaks up.\n\n“Me and Jenny were just playing tag that time my shirt was all ripped up, like I said.”\n“Yes, I remember and I believe you. Now off you go, and remember dinner will be ready just before night fall.”\n\nAlexander agrees he’ll be careful and runs out to play with his friends.\n\nYou watch him briefly from the door.\n\n“Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn’t be a little more protective of him.” You say.\n“He’s fine. Better he get some claw scratches and bruises now so he doesn’t grow up to be completely sheltered.” Bobby responds.\n“Yeah I know all too damn well what the dangers that can bring, especially with the way the world is now. Still, can’t help but worry at times.”\n\nBobby stands up and walks over to reassure you.\n\n“Well of course you worry, you’re a good mother. And here you always thought you wouldn’t make a good one, remember?”\n“Yeah, that was a whole other lifetime ago. I can honestly say I’m glad those old days are behind us.”\n\nBobby nods and begins to caress you. You return his affection with a kiss and the pair of you just sort of hold each other for awhile.\n\nSeems surreal at times that you arrived at this point. Married, a child, and living modest home in a town mainly consisting of mutants. Though given both your family and Bobby’s, maybe it makes sense you fit in better with a community full of mutants.\n\nTo be honest, you think the only real problem you ever had with moving in and marrying Bobby to begin with was due to the situation with his sister Diana. You wonder if you would’ve done all this sooner had she never been in the picture. Oh well, no point in playing “What if” especially since everything worked out.\n\nThis life is harder than your old one in several ways, but given all the new skills you learned and all of what you’ve managed to achieve, you’re definitely a stronger and better person now than you ever were before.\n\n“Well I guess I better get started on dinner. Unless you want what Mrs. Zerul is serving down the street.” You say elbowing Bobby in the side for his previous comment.\n“Oh yeah because hideous old women with humps on their back and scales on their face really do it for me. You know I was joking about that.”\n“I know. You brought the groceries right?”\n“Yeah, just vegetables and meat though. Didn’t get a hold of much else this time.”\n“It’s all I ever really need. I know you’re probably tired from getting the stuff last night, but can you help me get started?” you ask.\n“Sure. Meet you in the kitchen.” Bobby responds.\n\nBobby heads to the root cellar and you head to the kitchen when you start your preparations. You’re lucky to have the kitchen amenities you have compared to most in this town. Wood burning stoves aren’t that common here, but then again most mutants don’t bother cooking their food at all. You and Bobby of course aren’t savages.\n\nAs you’re getting everything set, Bobby comes up with the groceries and sets them down on the large prep table.\n\n“There you go baby. You need me to help prep the meat?”\n“Nah, I can do it. Doesn’t take me long.”\n“Okay, I’m going to get some sleep. Call me if you need anything.”\n“Will do. Thanks dear.” You say and Bobby kisses you on the cheek before heading off to bedroom.\n\nYou grab your machete and stare at the table.\n\nThe tied and gagged naked young woman continues to squirm on the table. If she could, she’d probably scream or beg. You’re guessing she was part of whatever caravan Bobby and his congregation raided. Probably the merchant since she doesn’t look like a guard. That’s a good thing; her meat isn’t going to be as tough.\n\nThis would be the other advantage of living in a mutant town: They don’t frown upon cannibalism here.\n\nThe young woman’s eyes widen as you bring the machete down to finish her off.\n\nAs you chop up the rest of the woman’s body, you briefly think about the past again, specifically when Bobby’s aunt was psychoanalyzing you.\n\nShe certainly was right when she said you were prone to revel in great violence under the right circumstances.\n",
  "page 146": "THURSDAY\n\n\n“SUZY! WAKE UP! GET UP NOW!” you hear Donna scream followed by her pulling and shaking you.\n“Wha…the fuck?!” you utter completely confused. You’re even more confused when Donna grabs the rifle near you and fires it, succeeding in smashing her shoulder due to being unprepared by the kick back and not holding it right in the first place. She cries out an obscenity and drops the rifle.\n\nWhile you still aren’t completely sure of what’s going on, you do look in the direction that Donna was firing and see what she was firing at.\n\nSeveral people are loping in your direction snarling and generally making unpleasant sounds. You don’t know who they are or what’s wrong with them, but you follow Donna’s lead and pull your pistol to fire at them.\n\nYou aren’t exactly the best shot in the world, but after a couple shots you clearly hit the closest one in the chest, who stops temporarily, but then recovers until you hit him again, at which point he falls. It doesn’t deter any of the others though and they just continue to run at you.\n\nMeanwhile Donna gets off another shot, but misses wildly. Seeing their numbers and knowing you don’t have the skill or the ammo to deal with these obviously insane people, you tell Donna you and her need to run and you don’t need to do it twice.\n\nYou and Donna run towards the group of tents still in the distance. You still don’t know if it’s a military encampment or what, but the key thing is it’s in the opposite direction of those things chasing you.\n\nYou’re about half way towards your destination and your sister becomes a horror movie cliché by falling behind and then tripping and falling on her face.\n\n“Suzy!” you hear her scream and you turn around to see several of those things almost on her.\n\nYou run back and shoot a couple of them, but by the time you grab her hand to help her up, one of them manages to grab her and bite her shoulder.\n\nDonna screams pierce your ears and you blast the thing in the head splattering its blood on you and Donna. The two that you shot (but failed to obviously kill) at this point have recovered and are already attacking you and Donna.\n\nYou’re tackled to the ground and you just barely manage to keep the thing from biting you by putting your forearm against its throat as it desperately tries to bite your face off. You get a good look at the thing at this range, while its dirty, crazed and making the animalistic growling noises, it looks completely human. Rabies perhaps?\n\nIn any case you manage to get your pistol arm free of the thing’s grip and bring your weapon to its temple and blow its brains out. It slumps on top of you and you’re quick to get out from under it.\n\nMeanwhile, Donna is on the ground again screaming for you to help her and her assailant chewing on her leg. You wonder helping Donna’s even an option at this point. Donna’s badly wounded and there are still several of those things coming at you, not counting the one currently munching on Donna’s leg.\n\nYou don’t know what these things are except they look like dirty rabid humans. And maybe that’s all they are, but if there’s anything you’ve learned from situations like this is those same clichéd horror movies is when someone is bitten…\n\nDonna’s eyes widen as soon as she realizes that you’re aiming at her. You don’t give her time to do anything else before you pull the trigger.\n\nHaving done the grim task of putting your sister out of her misery, you run back towards the tents though you’re in a bit of a daze at this point.\n\nThe noise you and those things have caused, start bringing out the occupants of the tents, or at least whoever is using them. You see a few figures with rifles, possibly in uniforms. It’s apparent that they’ve caught sight of you and your pursuers and are yelling something at you, but again your brain has partially “shut down” after killing your sister so you’re stilling running towards them, ignoring the fact that they’re ready to open fire. It wouldn’t matter anyway, since it isn’t like you can run backwards with those things chasing you.\n\nBullets whiz in your direction missing you; at first maybe they AREN’T actually aiming at you and are aiming at the creatures chasing you. Maybe your luck is changing.\n\nBut then you catch one in the head. You don’t even feel it. You just drop like a sack. The military wasn’t taking any chances.\n",
  "page 267": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of a noisy vehicle outside. You waste no time in springing to your feet.\n\nYou cautiously peek out the window and see a military truck pulling up behind Jed’s vehicle.\n\n“Are you fucking kidding me? Is fate just determined to make my life more hell than it needs to be?” you say to yourself.\n\nYou then see a familiar figure getting out of the truck and carrying a rifle. He looks around and then wastes no time in running to the house.\n\n“Bobby?” you say and then go move the dresser. By the time you’ve gotten out the door, you hear him downstairs kicking over the sofa in the front door entryway and calling out your name.\n\n“SUZY! SUZY!” he shouts in a panic as you hear him knocking over shit in an effort to look for you.\n“I’m right here and you’re lucky it’s just me, because anyone else would’ve long since blown your head off with the way you’re announcing yourself by now.” You say coming down the stairs.\n\nWhen you see Bobby, he definitely looks like he’s seen better days, but when Bobby sees you he drops his weapon and his face is one of extreme elation. Like a great weight has been lifted off of him by seeing you. He rushes forward to presumably hug you and you immediately pull your own shotgun up.\n\n“Alright, stop.” You say.\n“Wha…it’s me! Bobby!” he exclaims.\n“Yeah, I know who you are silly, I’m just wondering WHY you’re here. Who else is with you?” you ask.\n“Nobody! It’s just me! Suzy, just put the gun down, I’m…”\n“I don’t think so, after the week I’ve had I’m not too fucking keen on just putting my weapon down. Besides we didn’t part exactly on the best of terms or have you forgotten?”\n“I know! I know! I was an asshole about that! I didn’t mean any of that shit I said! I was a big fucking asshole and you were right the whole time! I should’ve realized sooner that you were always the one for me and that I should’ve made the sacrifice for you because you’re completely worth it and I still love you”\n“And…what? You just realized this today?”\n“No! I realized it soon after my aunt called telling me she had you over here.”\n“Wait, didn’t she call you on Tuesday? I was drugged and held against my will by your psycho aunt and uncle and you didn’t think to come here sooner?”\n“I…it took me awhile to sort out my feelings…I was still confused…”\n\nYou can’t believe this!\n\n“Took you awhile to sort out your feelings?! Confused? Are you fucking kidding me?! That’s your excuse?”\n“It’s no excuse! That’s how it was! I thought there was no chance again with you given how bad we broke up! And besides, I’m sure my aunt told you how I pleaded for your life. It’s probably why you’re still alive.”\n“Yeah, okay fine I’ll give you that. Your groveling probably kept me alive initially, but if you REALLY wanted to come here and play white knight and save the damsel, you REALLY should’ve got here fucking sooner! Do you even know what the fuck I’ve had to deal with here for past three days?”\n“No, but I really did try to get here sooner! Seriously I did!”\n“Oh yes, sorting out your feelings and probably getting one last fuck from Diana…”\n“Hey! For your information I killed Diana.”\n\nWell Bobby’s peaked your interest enough that you lower your shotgun.\n\n“Wait, you killed that bitch?” you ask.\n“Well it wasn’t on purpose, but yeah I accidently killed her when I was trying to leave the compound. I told her to either the hell out of the way or I was going through that gate anyway. Never believed she wouldn’t move and the crunch under the tires was pretty much an indication that I killed her.” Bobby replies.\n“That’s not exactly an accident Bobby, but that’s okay. That’s another point in your favor.”\n“Anyway, I ended up getting held up in town by the fucking National Guard, when both of my cousins decided it would be a good idea to antagonize them even more by firing upon them. That went about as well as you’d expect…”\n“Your cousins? You brought family with you?”\n“Wasn’t exactly my idea. Two of my cousins, William and Aaron wanted to leave the compound as well, so they followed me for a while in William’s vehicle. Then before I knew it, Aaron was firing at shit, which called more attention than it needed to. I parted company with them as soon as I could, but by that time I had the National Guard all over me. Crashed the vehicle and nearly got shot. In fact I probably would’ve gotten shot had it not been for this tight ass government official insisting I be held for questioning. Thought I was a terrorist or something.”\n“So you were held captive by the National Guard?”\n“Well I was on Wednesday and for part of Thursday until the camp got overrun by fucking crazy cannibals. Nearly getting eaten was a nice change of pace of getting punched in the face and beaten.”\n\nWell that explains the bruises and scratches on Bobby’s face and arms as well as the condition of his clothing, which is torn in several places.\n\n“Spent the rest of Thursday just trying to get away from those fuckers and trying to make it through the town which was a warzone at this point. Wasn’t until Friday night I managed to get a hold of a Guardsman’s truck and drive out of there.”\n\nYou remain silent as Bobby at this point walks over to you. He takes your hand.\n\n“I’m sorry I didn’t get here sooner Suzy, I really wanted to and I really tried. My mind was always pre-occupied with concern of if you were even still alive or not. I can only imagine what horrors you had to face here. I don’t know exactly what happened here, but I saw all the bodies outside and the state of the house…and well I can guess you didn’t have an easy time of it. I’m here now though and you don’t need to worry anymore. We can go anywhere you want. We can run away to anywhere just like you wanted. I’m done with my family; I’m done with my religion. From the moment I knew you were being held here, I knew YOU were my family. YOU were my religion and I love you so much. You have to believe me.”\n\nYou look at Bobby and see in his eyes he really means all this. You stroke his face lovingly.\n\n“Oh Bobby…”\n\nAnd then promptly slap him. He gives a surprised look.\n\n“…you’re goddamn right you don’t know what horrors I fucking faced! I was scared the entire time!”\n\nYou go into an exaggerated tirade about what you experienced while you were here. Not that what you really went through wasn’t bad, but to be honest it sounds like what Bobby went through was probably worse in his attempt to get here and you’re not going to let Bobby just think he can waltz back into your life and get you back with ease with his “hero” attempt.\n\n“…and did I mention I was nearly RAPED by rednecks several times?”\n“They didn’t…”\n“No they didn’t, but I had to fend for myself and I did a pretty damn good job at it. Proved to me that I have an inner strength that I never took advantage of before and when the chips are down, I don’t really need anyone.”\n\nBobby’s face starts to show one of distress and just before he goes into his routine of telling you more honeyed words of his love for you and begs you to take him back, you stop him by continuing to speak.\n\n“…but there also were times where things would have been a lot easier had someone had been around to help me.”\n\nNow you take Bobby’s hand.\n\n“(Sigh) Look Bobby, maybe all this crazy shit that’s happened between us and to us is like wiping the slate clean or something. Maybe we do have a future. I believe you when you say you love me and obviously you went through a lot to try to get here to save me. But we can’t just jump back into this like we were before. You’re going to have to give me some time.”\n\nBobby nods.\n\n“Okay. I understand Suzy. I do.”\n\nYou and Bobby just stare at each other for a while. It’s funny how you never thought you’d even see Bobby again, let alone reunite with him. Somehow the argument you had earlier in the week just doesn’t matter anymore.\n\n“Okay, let’s head upstairs to the bedroom.” You say and pat his hand.\n“What for?” Bobby asks.\n“For sex duh.” You say.\n“Sex? I thought you said you needed some time.”\n“Yeah well I decided that some of that time involves pleasuring me. Besides, this isn’t YOUR reward, it’s MY fucking reward for surviving this shitty week. So I hope you’re prepared to do a lot of licking.”\n“Hey whatever you need.” Bobby says following up the stairs.\n\nDoesn’t take long for the pair of you to be totally into your reunification. In fact you’re enjoying yourself so much you nearly don’t notice the bright flash coming from the window and loud noise in the distance.\n\n“Shit that was bright, glad I wasn’t looking directly at whatever that was.” You say.\n“I wouldn’t know about the light since my face was buried in your pussy at the time, I did hear the noise though.” Bobby says.\n\nThe pair of you wander over to the window and in the far distance you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn’t a big one.\n\n“So…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“Looks like.” Bobby says.\n“Oh well, we’ll be okay.”\n“You seem very sure of that, I remember a time you would’ve been worrying about radiation and everything else.”\n“Well you’ve been through this hellish week the same way I have and we both survived. Together I think our chances are even greater. Besides, your aunt told me GZ put drugs in the water that are supposed make people more resistant to radiation and disease and such.”\n“What seriously?”\n“Seriously. That drug is what also made most people go batshit crazy. Doesn’t affect everyone though and I never did get a solid answer on why I wasn’t affected. Guess you aren’t either.”\n“Maybe we’re already crazy?”\n“Probably.” You chuckle.\n\nYou and Bobby go back to doing what you were doing and why the hell not? It isn’t like the apocalypse isn’t going to still be there.\n\nLater you Bobby load up his army truck with all the stuff you think you’ll need. You aren’t sure where you’ll go yet, but you maintain a positive attitude that you’ll ultimately be fine.\n\nAs he begins driving away from the house, you open up one of the Tupperware containers of food that you took with you when you left and start eating.\n\n“What is that you’re eating? It looks awful.” Bobby remarks.\n“I dunno. I think it’s some sort of beef. I know it’s not much for looks, but it tastes delicious though. Your uncle Leslie was a really good cook. I’ve never been a big food person, but I’m seriously going to miss eating from that house. I took this as a last hoorah as it were. You want some?”\n\nBobby’s face begins to look a little concerned.\n\n“Suzy, you’ve been eating out of my aunt and uncle’s fridge? How much have you eaten?”\n“I dunno. I’ve had at least one meal a day there. What the hell else was I going to eat? I’m telling you though I’d like to know how to make this stuff, but I imagine just picking up meat from the super market isn’t going to be an option anymore.”\n“Oh you can make that stuff without needing a super market. Suzy, my aunt and uncle were fucking CANNIBALS! You’ve probably been eating human meat for the past three days!” Bobby exclaims.\n\nYou stop eating and start looking at the meal you’re eating. You poke at it a few times wondering if you’re going to come across a finger or something, but after doing this for a few seconds you don’t find anything out of the ordinary, and you scoop out another piece and eat it.\n\nBobby looks shocked.\n\n“What? Still tastes good. Think of it this way, at least we know I’m willing to eat human flesh if things get tough out here in the big bad apocalyptic wasteland. You sure you don’t want any?”\n\nBobby just shakes his head and continues to drive.\n\n“Hm, more for me.” You say with a shrug and take another bite.\n\n“You really have changed Suzy.” Bobby remarks.\n“Yeah, well happens to the best of us.” You say.\n",
  "page 2": "Even if you did manage to find a job, it wouldn’t change the fact that you’ll still have to put up with Kelly’s abuse. She’d just bitch at you for something else. She will always find an excuse.\n\nWith that in mind, you realize that your options are limited. You’re going to have to move out and go live at the only place available to an unemployed bum like yourself, your friend Julie’s house.\n\nChances are she’s either passed out, hung over or in the middle of yet another one of her seemingly never ending parties, so you figure calling her will be useless and call your sister Donna instead (who might only be slightly more available)\n\nIgnoring Bobby’s calls, you speed dial Donna and surprisingly she picks up after only a couple of rings. Even more surprisingly you don’t hear any music or noise in the background. Must’ve caught a rare in between party time.\n\n“Hello? Suzy?” Donna asks.\n“Yeah, it’s me.” You answer.\n“Hey haven’t spoken to you in awhile! How are things? Not too bad I hope?”\n“Well…yeah they are kinda. I just got my ass chewed out by Kelly. (Sigh) She’s saying I have to find a job by the end of the week or she’s throwing me out.”\n“Yeah sounds like her.”\n“You know how hard it is for me to find a job. I just don’t think it’s going to happen by the end of the week and in any case I don’t think I can take her abuse any longer. I’m done.”\n“Well you shouldn’t have to put up with her shit. She’s a fucking bullying bitch! I mean that’s certainly why I left.”\n“Yeah so I was wondering, could I move in with you and Julie?”\n\nThere’s a bit of a pause.\n\n“Well…I mean sure you could come here. I wouldn’t mind and I mean you know Julie would be fine with it, but I know you’re not exactly miss fun and excitement and I think you’re aware of how wild things can get over here.” Donna says.\n“Yeah, but anything is better than continuing to live with Kelly right now, and given how big Julie’s home is, I’m sure I can still find a quiet corner to not bother anyone in.” you respond.\n“Okay, well as long as you don’t because a buzz killing party pooper, you’re more than welcome to stay here. So are you coming today?”\n“I think I need to pack up quite a bit of stuff before doing that. I also have to have some way of transporting the stuff over. I dunno, maybe I can borrow Peter’s car or something.”\n“What about Bobby?”\n“Uh, no, I’m still not speaking with him at this time. Besides, he’d probably just try to convince me to live in his compound and I’m just not in the mood to deal.”\n“Hrm. I certainly understand that. Well, since you said you’re going to have to spend a little time packing up your stuff, I can come pick you up tomorrow. I’d do it today, but the vehicle situation isn’t ideal right now. Got someone repairing my car right now and Julie’s vehicle… well let’s say it’s going to be even longer before . It was quite the part last Friday.”\n“I’ll bet. Well that sounds like it’ll work for me. When will you get here?”\n“Oh probably sometime in the afternoon. I’ll call before hand.”\n“Okay, well I guess I’ll see you then.”\n“I’ll let Julie know, she’ll be pretty excited.”\n\nAt this point you say goodbye to your sister and you hang up.\n\nYou get to packing up as many of your vital things as possible. Really it doesn’t take you too long at all. You didn’t own too much stuff, and stuff like furniture or a bed is going to be provided at Julie’s house though you wonder if you shouldn’t move your bed over there if only because the beds over there are probably like petri dishes.\n\nIn any event, you spend the rest of your night in the basement, which will probably be your last night ever here. It seems weird and scary, but on another level you are a little excited. Maybe it was time for a change.\n\nWho knows, maybe you’ll indulge in a little partying yourself when you get to your new home, hell if anyone deserves to let loose a little its certainly you.\n",
  "page 149": "As tempting as it is to just run, once again, you don’t really have anywhere viable to run to and now you’d have a horde of those things possibly dogging your steps if you did, so you’re going to just be satisfied with short term safety and keep optimistic that things aren’t as hopeless as they seem.\n\nYou run up the stairs and into the trailer. Donna slams and locks the door, and then you both shove a couch in front of it. You look up at the ceiling of the trailer and see the sun roof open which naturally explains how Jimmy Ray got up there. You can hear him firing and swearing.\n\n“Okay, I think we should be safe now.” Donna remarks.\n“I wouldn’t count on that. I mean yeah, they’d have a hell of time breaking through the door, and granted the windows are high enough that they might have trouble breaking and climbing into them, but I still don’t feel safe cooped up in here.” You say and start looking around for more furniture and start moving a table under the sunroof.\n\n“Suzy, what’re you doing?”\n“I’m going to go help your boyfriend if I can. You got a weapon down here?”\n“There’s Jimmy’s bat and some knives in the kitchen, but he really doesn’t need your help. You should stay down here, I mean what if they try to break in like you said?”\n“Well I’ll be able to shoot them from above a lot better from the roof. Climb up if things start getting grim.” You say and start climb through the roof.\n\nWhen you reach the roof, Jimmy notices you as he’s in the middle of reloading his weapon.\n\n“What the fuck are you doin’ up here, get back in the trailer with your sister!” he says.\n“I’m here to help.” You say scanning the area.\n“I don’t need any help, now…”\n\nYou interrupt Jimmy, when you look over the other side of the trailer, see one particularly sneaky freak skulking near it and shoot him.\n\n“You aren’t even paying attention to the other side of the trailer. You need to be aware of your surroundings!” you say.\n“Aw, he couldn’t have gotten up here, and I would’ve heard him had he tried.” Jimmy remarks. “Fine, stay up here, but don’t get in my way!” he then adds realizing that you aren’t going anywhere.\n\nFrom on top of the trailer, you can see a good deal more of the park in general. You and Jimmy actually aren’t the only ones standing on a trailer, you see several women with guns doing their best at fighting off this horde. You even see Tina when you look back towards her trailer.\n\nThe situation isn’t quite as grim as it once appeared as you see a group of hillbillies from the east side of the park making their way back and soon start helping out with mopping up the freaks that have infested it.\n\nJimmy and yourself mostly keep to picking off the ones that come too close to his trailer. He actually compliments you or your shooting at one point. To be honest, it’s sort of weird to you how much of a natural you are at it.\n\nAfter few more bloody minutes, it’s mostly over and the…well you still don’t know WHAT they are exactly, but they’re no longer the threat they were.\n\n“Whew, I think we got the last of those sons of bitches.” Jimmy says.\n“Yeah, well I’m not in any hurry to check. I’m out of bullets anyway, so I’m just going to go back into the trailer with my sister.”\n“Okay, I’m gonna keep an eye out from here. Um… I wasn’t sure about you at first, but thanks for yer help.”\n\nSuddenly Donna’s head pops up from the opening in the roof.\n\n“What’s going on up here? The shooting has mostly stopped, is it over?” Donna asks.\n“It’s over in the sense that I’m guessing we aren’t in any danger of being overrun. Was everything okay down there? We were trying to keep them from clawing at the trailer too much.” You say.\n“Yeah, a few got as close as the door and then one of you guys shot them.” Donna says.\n“Shit, let’s get back down in the trailer.” Jimmy suddenly says walking over to where you and Donna are.\n“Did you just see more of those things?”\n“No, I see…\n\n“There you are, ya slackin’ piece of shit! Where the fuck were you when we needed help over on the east side of the park. Nearly got my ass eaten and not in a good way!” Mel shouts from the ground as he walks with a couple of other men behind him.\n\n“Aw Mel, I didn’t even know about it until it was too late, I was uh…”\n“You were thinkin’ with yer dick as usual. Is that…is that blondie there I see? Holy shit, didn’t think you were fool enough to fall fer this idiot’s charms.” Mel says.\n“I didn’t…I was looking for my sister and I helped her and Jimmy out here.”\n“Is that right?” Mel asks.\n“Yeah, it’s true! I was with her sister…and um, by the time I knew what was goin’ on I couldn’t leave this trailer because it was surrounded by those things! I was pickin’ them off with the shotgun and then Suzy came here and helped out. Good thing too. There were a shitload of them, as you can tell by the bodies!” Jimmy says and begins pointing at them.\n\nMel stares at the bodies that Jimmy’s pointing to and doesn’t seem impressed.\n\n“Jimmy, yer so full of shit right now, yer eyes are brown. By the number of bodies here and their various distances from the trailer, it wasn’t THAT surrounded. Whatever, doesn’t matter, come on down, you’re comin’ with us.”\n“Where are we goin?” Jimmy asks.\n“We’re gonna go try to fetch some medical supplies from town. We got some people hurt pretty fuckin’ bad an’ other than a few half used basic medical kits that a few people scrounged up, all else we got is a shitload of alcohol. You’d think those military trucks woulda had some medical shit in them, but no. I suppose SOME people here got some meth, crack and a few other unconventional drugs, but last thing we need is more goddamn junkies runnin’ around here.” Mel says glaring at Dan.\n“Town? Um…don’t ya think it’ll be pretty fucked up there?” Jimmy asks.\n“Of course it’s gonna be fucked up there, but it needs to get done. Or we at least need to try. So come on Jimmy, get yer ass down here, what about you blondie?” Mel asks.\n“What about me what?” you ask.\n“You gonna come with us? Obviously you’re good enough with a weapon to take care of yourself an’ we’re a little short on that at the moment.”\n\nAs Jimmy kisses Donna on the cheek and tells her something about coming back to her, you briefly consider Mel’s offer. While you’ve certainly “grown” past being the wallflower you tended to be, you know you’re not some action heroine badass.\n\n“While I appreciate the offer Mel, I think I’d be better off staying here, I’m still not as skilled as you guys are when it comes to shooting. I wouldn’t want to be a liability.” You say.\n“Hm, I guess that’s an honest assessment of yourself. Alright then, keep an eye out on things here. As for the rest of ya, come on let’s round up a few more folks and then let’s see just how fucked the town is.” Mel says and he and the rest walk off leaving you and Donna who duck back inside Jimmy’s trailer.\n\n“I’m really glad you didn’t go with them. I mean that’s gotta be a suicide mission.” Donna says.\n“Well it will certainly be dangerous that’s for sure.” You say.\n“So you still think it’s a good idea to stay here?” Donna asks.\n“Still want to leave huh?” you say.\n“Don’t you? I mean we just went through TWO major attacks at this place now! Who knows what the hell is gonna hit us next! More of those freaks probably, but I’m thinking that we got a better chance if we do leave this time.”\n“How’s that?” you ask.\n“Well Jimmy Ray’s got a truck that he parked between his trailer and the next one as a poor man’s barrier of sorts and he didn’t take his keys with him. In fact they’re over on the table over there. That suggests to me that we can easily take his while he’s gone. In fact, Mel and most of those redneck assholes will all be gone and the others are nursing their wounds, so now would be the perfect time to get the hell out of here.”\n“I used up all my ammo fighting off those cannibal things. What about weapons?”\n“I guess we’ll have to get by on close combat ones for awhile, but Jimmy’s probably got another gun in his bedroom somewhere. Look, I’ll search this place and you go grab your bags from our trailer. I still got a bag packed near my bed from yesterday, so you can grab that one too.”\n\nYou chuckle a bit at Donna’s suggestion of completely robbing Jimmy Ray blind and take her plan into consideration.\n",
  "page 1": "You don’t want to move out and you can’t trust yourself to not get distracted as usual trying to find a job. You need help and the only other person you know that has one in the house is Peter, so you decide to go see him and hope he isn’t in the middle of “working.”\n\nYou head to the garage and knock on the door. From within you hear a come on in so you do so, unfortunately given Peter’s state of near nakedness and a tube of KY in hand its obvious he wasn’t expecting you.\n\n“Oh. It’s you. What do you want? I got a couple of guys coming over soon and I still need to lube up.” he says\n“Ugh…I need to speak to you.” You say trying not to look at him. “Can you put some damn clothes on?”\n“(Sigh) Fine, but let’s hurry this up.” Peter says and puts on a robe.\n\n“Peter, I need your help in finding a job and before you even suggest it, no I’m not going to do what you do for money.”\n“Oh of course not. Wouldn’t enter my mind to suggest such a thing to the likes of you. Which means I don’t have many other suggestions for you. I mean I can only imagine you’ve failed horribly at getting a normal job due to your lack of a college degree, personality quirks and crippling introversion. You don’t seem to have the motivation to start your own business and for some baffling reason you don’t even take advantage of the natural gifts you do have. Pfft, if I was you, I’d start now because you’re just getting older.”\n“Peter, I’m not a whore. I’m not going to just spread my legs to everyone for cash.”\n“Who said everyone? Just get one rich one, shit shouldn’t be that hard for you.”\n“That’s not who I am, besides I have a boyfriend…”\n“Who? Bobby? I thought you two broke up.”\n“No, well sort of…it’s complicated.”\n“Well then you need to work something out with him then and let him take care of you because while I didn’t hear the whole rant, Kelly was loud enough that I made out some of it even from here. Sounds like she gave you an ultimatum.”\n“I know. I know. I don’t know what to do.” You say slumping into a nearby chair.\n\nPeter and you have never been close and most of the time he’s annoyed you by constantly stealing your clothes in the past, but to his credit he go over and tries to console you a bit with a hug, given that his dick is still swinging out of his robe, you’d rather he didn’t and politely tell him you’re fine.\n\n“Have you tried the circus?” Peter suddenly asks.\n“What?” you respond.\n“The circus. There’s a small one set up a few miles west outside of town. Almost like a gypsy camp really. Remember how our family used to go together? I think it’s about the only time we all got along.”\n“Yeah…I always liked the clowns the most. I liked how outgoing and happy they always were. Even thought I’d grow up and be one at one point.”\n“Hm, I think you were the only one as far as that went. I still remember you used to paint up your face with mom’s make up and try to entertain Donna and me at home. Though to be quite honest all you did was scare the hell out of us.”\n“Yeah…that’s why I gave up that dream. Figured I was doing it wrong.” You say gloomily.\n“Oh. Sorry about that, didn’t mean to be a dream crusher.”\n“It’s okay, given my introversion I doubt if I would’ve been able to actually get in front of a crowd and do it anyway.”\n“Hey, you shouldn’t have given up if that was what you wanted to do. I mean maybe you should pursue it now. I mean you don’t have much to lose right and how hard could it be? Put on make up, dress up silly, and generally act creepy…erm I mean goofy.”\n\nPeter’s words do light a certain spark in you.\n\n“Hmmm, maybe you’re right…I’ll do it!” you suddenly exclaim.\n“Good, glad to hear you’re excited about something. So are you good now? I mean I’d talk more, but y’know still got guys coming over and…”\n“Oh right, yeah I’m good. Hold on, can I borrow your car to get to the circus tomorrow?”\n“Uhhh, yeah sure. Keys are over there.”\n“Thanks again Peter.” You say taking the keys and leave.\n\nYou head back down to the basement filled with excitement at the prospect of pursuing your childhood dream again! It all seems a little crazy right now, but the more you think about it the more it makes sense.\n\nYou spend the rest of the night in good spirits and maintain a positive attitude that everything will be okay tomorrow.\n",
  "page 148": "THURSDAY\n\n\n“…your family will feel right at home in one of our…”\n\n“Agh, shut the hell up.” You instinctively groan at the Ground Zero ad. You call out for Donna to turn her tv off, but considering she doesn’t, you assume that she must not be here.\n\nYou look around for your phone to check the time, but you can’t find it. You can only assume that you dropped or misplaced it somewhere. Hardly matters, you don’t have too many people to contact anymore at this point. Your relationship with Bobby is over. Julie’s probably dead and who the hell knows what’s happened to the rest of your family in town. It isn’t like you need to call anyone or anyone needs to call you. You’re more pissed about your laptop, which apparently somehow caught a bullet during the mayhem yesterday. So much for keeping up on what might be going on in the world.\n\nIn any case there’s a clock in the trailer and the time indicates that you’ve slept through the morning as usual. Weird, since you fell asleep fairly early. You wonder where the hell Donna could’ve went to, but you’re guessing she might be with her friend Tina.\n\nAfter turning the TV off in Donna’s room, all you’re left with is the noise that’s going on outside. Sounds like the good ol’ boys are still at it. You take a look out one of your windows and see several men in the field taking apart the military trucks, or rather severely altering them. It almost looks like they’re going to build a whole new vehicle out of them or something.\n\nSince there isn’t anyway to entertain yourself with your laptop being shot up, you aren’t in the mood to watch Ground Zero infomercials, and you don’t want to risk the possibility of Donna suddenly walking in on you with your vibrating boyfriend (Thankfully nothing happened to that form of entertainment, though you do worry about batteries for the future) your only option is to head outside and try to find Donna or find something productive to do. You never thought such a day would come where you’d be leaving the comfort of a couch to potentially do some work, but here you are.\n\nAfter going through your routine of washing up and changing clothes, you decide to take the rifle and pistol with you, just in case.\n\nYou exit the trailer and head on over to Tina’s place.\n\nYou knock on the trailer door and hardly recognize Tina without all her makeup on. Not that she’s ugly, in fact she’s actually less trashy looking without it on.\n\n“What the fuck do you want blondie?” Tina asks.\n“Um, is Donna here?”\n“No, she’s not fucking here. Try a few trailers over, I think she took a shine to Jimmy Ray and is over there.”\n“Oh. Okay then.” You say.\n“If you see her, tell her, she better not be distractin’ him all fucking day with her pussy, cause Mel wants him to be workin’ on somethin’. I dunno what, exactly, but I don’t wanna have to listen to him bitch to me about it.”\n“Got it.” You answer and begin to leave, but Tina calls out to you.\n\n“Hey, you ain’t after, Mel’s dick are ya?” Tina asks which completely catches you off guard.\n“What?”\n“He told me yesterday, you and he spoke and said you were sweet on him and he had to tell you to stop flirting so much.”\n\nTina looks at you as if she’s detecting if you’re going to lie to her, but you have no intention of doing so since you’re defending yourself from a horrible lie!\n\n“Uh, with no disrespect, but Mel is NOT my type and I did not flirt with him.” You answer.\n“See, I knew that bastard was delusional. I didn’t even believe him when he told me that shit. Any retard can tell that a girl like you would have nothing to do with the likes of him in that way.” Tina says.\n“Did I do something that he could’ve mistaken for flirting?\n“Yeah, you were talking to him. He probably told all his friends that you were flirting with him. Hell, he might’ve even said he fucked you, but he tends to keep his tall tales a little more realistic nowadays. Whatever, he’s getting old and likes to think he’s still some sort of chick magnet. Still, I love the sonofabitch despite everything.”\n\nAs you’re about to finish your illuminating conversation with Tina, you suddenly hear gunshots and yelling.\n\n“Oh shit!” you say believing that the military has returned already.\n\nSeveral of the trailer park crew start running towards the noise with weapons in hand. Tina calls out to a skinny one who looks like methhead.\n\n“Hey! Hey Dan, what the fuck’s goin’ on?” Tina shouts\n“A bunch of fuckin’ zombies or some shit are attackin’ us! Mel’s called almost everyone to defend the east and south part of the park. Looks like a shitload of them are comin’ from town!”\n“Wait, did you just say fuckin’ zombies?” Tina asks.\n“Yeah. I mean shit, I dunno what they are, I just know Bobby Ray got all bit up by one of them. Maybe they’re just cannibals or high on bath salts. Remember like that one time I…”\n“Dan, whatever! Just go! Go! Go! And you, get inside here, quick!” Tina says waving away Dan who continues to his destination.\n“But I gotta find my sister.” You remark\n“She’s probably safe with Jimmy Ray.”\n“Didn’t Dan say he just got bit by zombies?”\n“That was Bobby Ray! Now get yer ass in here, we’ll bar the door and hunker down inside here until Mel and the boys take care of this.”\n\nYou’re not going to leave your sister’s potential fate in the hands of some redneck who you know nothing about though. You’re going to make the effort to at least find her; besides, you’d rather not barricade yourself in anywhere unless you have to.\n\n“Where is Jimmy’s trailer again?!” you ask.\n“You’re a damn idiot blondie. (sigh) it’s more towards the entrance and has a badly spray painted picture of a naked woman on the side of it. I suggest you get a move on.” Tina says and slams her door shut.\n\nYou follow the advice and start heading towards your new destination, which has considerably more gunfire and shouting coming from that direction. You feel like you’re in one of those video games that you played on your computer sometimes, except this is unfortunately very real.\n\nWith your rifle held in front of you the whole time, you continue to move at a quick yet cautious rate. You keep half expecting one of those freaks to suddenly jump out at you every time you pass one of the trailers. You catch a glance of people peeping out their windows of said trailers, sometimes you hear one of them shouting at you to “find some damn shelter.”\n\nEventually you hear a voice calling at you from above.\n\n“Hey blondie, what the hell are you doing down there?” you look up and see a shirtless young man with a shotgun standing on top of the trailer.\n\n“Suzy?! What the hell are you doing?!” another voice shouts, but this one is coming from inside the trailer. Sounds like Donna.\n\nYou glance back down and look at the trailer itself and notice that this is the one you’ve been looking for. You’re guessing that’s Jimmy Ray standing on top of his trailer. You can sort of see Donna going for a guy like him. He’s got a rugged handsome look rather than a grizzled, unkept or outright disgusting appearance that some of the other guys around here have.\n\n“Donna?! I was looking for you, that’s what I’m doing out here.” You say while swiveling your head in several directions to keep an eye on your surroundings.\n“Well now you’ve found me, now get inside!” Donna shouts and starts to open up the door.\n“Donna, don’t leave that door open too long, I’m watching the main fighting at the front of the park and it’s not looking good. The east side is doing better though.”\n“Aren’t you suppose to be helping Mel?” you ask.\n“Pfft, yeah right. I mean I don’t hate him or anything, but I’m not riskin’ my life for that asshole. Oh fuck! More of them are getting through, and I mean a shitload! Get your asses inside!” Jimmy Ray shouts and starts aiming his shotgun.\n\nYou look and see a couple of the…things Dan was talking about. This is insane. Here you were worrying about the military and some unexpected threat like…zombies shows up? They can’t be zombies, they just can’t!\n\nWhatever they are, four of them are flailing about wildly and growling. They notice you and begin loping at you. The mere sight of them is troubling, but you quickly point your rifle at them and start firing.\n\nJimmy’s shotgun gets one of them in the leg which he then shoots again in the body. Another gets its head blown off. You use up the remainder of the clip to kill the two remaining. One of them didn’t even drop down dead until he almost reached you. They don’t look rotten (though they do look dirty and disheveled…which isn’t unlike some of the hillbillies here) and you didn’t even shoot one in the head, so while they may NOT be zombies, they’re certainly inhuman enough for you to be scared. (Some sort of sickness perhaps?)\n\nMeanwhile Donna’s at the door and calling to you. You see now that she’s not wearing her own clothes, but rather a robe of some sort. Certainly not hers.\n\n“Suzy, please! Get inside NOW!” she shouts as more of those things come running in your direction.\n“Goddamn it, the pair of you need to get inside!” Jimmy shouts as he snaps off another shot.\n\nWhile the freaks are definitely advancing, they’re also splitting up to attack several trailers. You wonder if you shouldn’t just get Donna and make your way out of here since it looks like this place is going to be overrun.\n",
  "page 4": "MONDAY\n\n\n“…our shelters are all equipped with the latest in state of the art technology, order now and…”\n\nClick.\n\nYou fell asleep watching tv again. Seems like they’re playing those damn commercials all the time now. Nothing like praying upon people’s fears due to recent world events.\n\nYou look at the time and see that you’ve slept for most of the morning, but given that you’re going to the circus to apply for a job you figure they will be open all night.\n\nYou also check your phone and see that Bobby’s been trying to reach you, but you can’t let yourself get distracted today. You need to focus on your goal of becoming a clown!\n\nYou take Peter’s car and head towards the circus. The drive is fairly uneventful though one thing you notice is the increase in police cars and police in general. Apparently there’s been some civil disturbance in multiple locations. You swear this one of the reasons why you never like leaving the basement in the first place. You hate the chaotic nature of people.\n\nBut then, if you have any hope of being a clown, you’re going to have to get used to dealing with crowds and people. In fact you’re going to have to get used to a lot of things, but you can’t let yourself get a panic attack about this. You have to go through with this.\n\nEventually you arrive at your destination. Or at least you assume it is. Peter wasn’t joking when he said it resembled a gypsy camp as opposed to a proper circus. You see a lot of little tents and some trailers, but nothing like a “big top.”\n\nMost of the people here are dwarves and last time you knew there wasn’t a large population of little people in your town, so you can only assume that they’re part of the circus. In fact from what you can tell there aren’t actually any customers, just carnies.\n\nAs you wander a bit, you start getting a lot of looks, you aren’t sure if they’re staring at you because you’re an outsider or if they’re just gawking at you. Might be a bit of both. Doesn’t take long before you’re surrounded by a lot of the little people and you start to feel like Dorothy.\n\n“Hey goldie with the legs, what’re you doing around here? We’re not open yet.” One of their numbers says.\n“Oh, well I wasn’t here for that. I’m here because…” you take a deep breath. “I want to be a clown!”\n\nThat certainly wasn’t the response that they were expecting. You hear a few whispers before the one that was talking speaks again.\n\n“A clown? Heh, well I’m not sure how successful that’s going to work out for you, but luckily for you the owner of this fine circus is also a clown, so you’ll need to speak with him either way. He’s in the tent over there. Roofie is probably still hung over so try to speak quietly.”\n“Roofie?”\n“Yeah, that’s his clown name… actually it mean be his real name as well. Anyway, don’t worry he’s not a rapist or anything like that, he’s just a drunk. In fact he’s probably the most mentally stable clown that we’ve ever had in this circus!”\n\nTaking the dwarf’s directions, you head over to Roofie’s tent. The smell of booze is strong and when you enter you see a balding older man in oversized pants and suspenders sitting at a table holding his head in both hands. Beer and whiskey bottle are plentiful enough that you make yourself heard just by tripping over some.\n\n“Goddamn it, it isn’t fucking showtime and nobody’s been coming anyway! Leave me alone, shit!” Roofie shouts not even looking up and continuing to hold his head.\n“Uh Mr. Roofie, I was told to speak to you.”\n\nRoofie turns and looks at you. A big red nose still on his face.\n\n“Huh? Wbo the hell are you? You look way too damn classy to be any whore that I’d be able to afford.”\n“My name’s Suzy and I want to be a clown.”\n\nAt this point Roofie slowly gets up from his seat kicking a few bottles aside. You continue to stand there starting to wonder if this was such a good idea.\n\n“A clown? Now why the hell would a cute blonde like you want to be a fuckin’ clown. Doesn’t make sense. You playin’ some sort of angle honey, because I assure you I’m in no mood and I ain’t got any money for you to grift anyway.”\n“No, it’s always been a life long dream ever since I was a little girl!” you say and then start to go into detail of how you enjoyed circus clowns and a bunch of other life story shit that doesn’t really interest Roofie. In fact he’s just struggling to stand up and listen right now.\n\n“Alright, alright, enough! Shit. I get it. (Sigh) Look honey I dunno what to tell you, we’re not exactly the Ringling Brothers here. I’m also not exactly looking to hire and I barely keep this place running as it is.”\n“Please let me be a clown! Just give me a chance!”\n“Argh, too fucking loud! Fine show me your clown stuff, just keep your voice down.”\n“Clown stuff?”\n“Uh yeah, like can you juggle? A little magic maybe? Some slapstick? Do you have a character like being a hobo or something? What you think it’s just easy as putting on white face make up, jumping around and laughing like an idiot?”\n“Well sort of…”\n“Sheesh. That’s the kind of thinking that makes us look creepy rather than amusing. You do realize that most people hate clowns right? Doesn’t help that we’re constantly vilified in horror movies nowadays. Yer wastin’ my time and yours if you don’t even know the basics.”\n\nRoofie isn’t exactly inspiring your confidence in this anymore. You feel like just heading home, but can’t run from this like you do with everything else, you’ve got no other options! You start to break down in tears.\n\n“Maybe I don’t know the basics, but I’ll work hard! (Sob) I’m serious about this! (Sob) I’ve tried to get a job everywhere else and if I don’t get this, I’ll get kicked out of my house! This is my last chance! (Sob)” you exclaim in between the tears.\n“Last chance? Darling, if bein’ a clown is your last chance, then you’ve got some major problems. (Sigh) I dunno even know why I’m entertaining this save for the fact that you’re easy on the eyes even without the need for alcohol and I’m a sucker for a damsel in distress. Besides if the news is any indication, we’re all gonna be dead by nuclear fire soon anyway, so fuck it. All right, stop yer weepin’ an maybe we can do something with you.”\n\nYou clear up your eyes a bit completely oblivious to Roofie’s brief doomsday expectations.\n\n“So you’ll help train me?”\n“Well, hopefully you’ll pick up something in time, but I’m not going to bother with regular training, you’re going to learn trial by fire which all good clowns do anyway. Now the greatest thing going for you is that you’re cute, so I’m thinkin’ we create a character for you that utilizes your, shall we say natural talent.”\n“Wait, I’m not going to have my breasts exposed while wearing nothing but red clown noses on my nipples do I?” you ask with concern.\n“(Snort) Jesus girl. No, nuthin’ like that.” Roofie chuckles “You’ll be fully clothed, though you’ll still be cute lookin’. Kinda like that one girl. Y’know in the funny books? The one with that rich vigilante. Anyway, the key thing to remember is you need to act cutesy. That’s going to be your character. You’ll be a cute clown while all the other clowns around you hilariously fail to try to win you over, hit each other with mallets and all that sort of shit…hmmm, this is actually sounding like a pretty good skit. I’m going to go round up the others and have a run through. In the meantime there’s a bunch of clown outfits in the trunk over there. Fairly certain we got a bunch of unused girly ones that should fit you. Some make up over and a mirror over there. Don’t worry about getting that just right for now since I know the lighting sucks in this tent. And uh, I dunno try to practice acting demure and shy.”\n\nRoofie leaves the tent and you’re left realizing that you might just succeed at getting this job! You quickly go through the trunk and find some pink and black-checkered leotard thing with a mini-skirt attached around the waist. It fits and fortunately while form fitting, it isn’t excessively tight, though your legs are still exposed so you put on some knee high purple striped leggings. You feel sort of vulnerable undressing in a tent that someone could just enter at any time, but fortunately there’s at least a privacy-screen you can dress behind.\n\nYou complete your look by putting your hair in girlish pigtails and applying a bunch of white face make up on and making your eyelashes and lips stand out with black eye liner and red lipstick.\n\nYou haven’t had time to practice when Roofie returns with a bunch of other men in various clown outfits. One of them is even a little person like you met out front.\n\n“Goddamn Roofie, I think I’m gonna have to rethink my plans of leaving your shitty carnival.” One of them says.\n“Leave? Hell, I think I’m in love.” Says another before Roofie speaks up.\n\n“Holy shit girl, I said cute clown, not harlequin seductress! You might need to tone it down in the future we’re still trying to run a family show more or less. All right never mind, let’s run through this and you guys TRY to remember to keep your tongues in your mouth on occasion.”\n\nSo you run through the routine while Roofie gives everyone directions. At first you naturally feel a little unready and uneasy what with everyone flirting with you, but soon you start to get into the swing of things. In fact it starts to come easy, you bat your eyes, give a few girlish giggles when someone slips and falls trying to give you a balloon flower and similar things.\n\nEventually Roofie stops everyone and says the skit needs to be refined a bit, but it should work. He then tells everyone to leave since he wants speak with you privately. This seems to disappoint the others who all continue to stare at you while leaving.\n\n“Well, other than the fact that I could tell some of them were having a really hard time in not actually groping you, I’d say that went well and even you seem to have gotten into character quickly. Maybe you do have what it takes after all. You still seem a little nervous though, which sort of helped your performance, but I’d rather you remain at ease. Anything that can help with that?” Roofie asks.\n“Well its like you said, I partially felt like one of them was going to jump on me at any given time. I mean is that something I’m going to have to worry about?”\n“Nah, that won’t happen. We carnies have a rule against hurting each other. I mean I won’t lie that they aren’t going to stare a lot at you and most likely a few are going to make crude comments, but that’s about as far as it is going to go if you decide to join and stay with us.”\n“You want me to join?”\n“If you’re still interested, sure. I think you’ve got something to offer. Though like I said, I’m still not sure why someone like you would want to join a broken down circus like this one. I still think someone like you would be a model or something.”\n“Well, I’m wearing an outlandish outfit, my face is all painted up and a bunch of guys are falling over themselves just to get a look at me. Seems like I’m doing the same thing as a model save for the eating disorder.”\n\nYour comment causes a laugh from Roofie.\n\n“Ha ha! That’s pretty good. I think I’m making the right decision. Okay, so about your sleeping arrangements, I might have to re-arrange some folks and that’s always going to cause problems, so you might have to sleep in your car for tonight…”\n“Wait you want me to move in here?”\n“Well yeah. I mean I told you we weren’t going to be staying here too much longer and you have to know that circus’ do tend to travel right?”\n“Yeah, right. Of course. It’s just, heh, I guess when I jumped into this I didn’t think all of it through. Though that’s probably obvious.”\n“Hrm, well it’s your choice. I’m not gonna lie and say this life is the easiest and if you feel more comfortable at home or have loved ones you don’t want to leave that’s understandable.”\n“I dunno if I’d say all that, but the concept of leaving my home…well it’s a bit of a big change for me. Like a VERY big one. And oddly, this opportunity has me seriously considering it.”\n“Well you do what’s in your heart. Anyway, we aren’t leaving today or even tomorrow, so I mean if you want to go back home and pick up some stuff, say goodbye to whoever, then you’ve got time. But even though we’re not leaving tomorrow we are going to be open for our last show and I’ll need you here. I’m hoping we’ll at least get some people here and make at least a bit of money before picking up stakes and all that.”\n\nYou aren’t sure what to do. The logical thing to do would be to go back home and gather some belonging, say a few goodbyes and try to convince Peter to drive you back up here so he gets his car back.\n\nBut there’s something within you that wonders if you shouldn’t just make a clean break immediately and stay. You know yourself and if you get back home you’re likely find some reason to stay and back out of this opportunity. You think about Bobby and how he’d be one of those reasons. You still haven’t called him back.\n",
  "page 3": "If Kelly wasn\u0027t putting the screws to you about moving out, you might be less inclined to return Bobby\u0027s phone call, however this is a desperate situation and despite your recent relationship problems, you still have strong feelings for Bobby and he will certainly help you out.\n\nYou grab your phone and call Bobby. The phone rings twice and then is answered.\n\n\"Hey Suzy, I\u0027ve been trying to get a hold of you.\" Bobby blurts out as soon as he answers.\n\"Yeah I know.\" You say.\n\"Look, I know we\u0027ve been having some difficulties lately, and our last argument was bad, but I really want to work things out, I love you.\"\n\nYou definitely have some major things to work out, but it\u0027s nice to know how Bobby feels about you.\n\n\"Well, we\u0027re going to be doing that, but that isn\u0027t the only reason why I called. I...uh need a new place to live. Kelly\u0027s kicking me out.\" You say.\n\"Oh, I see, you want to move in with me and my family...are you sure? I mean you know I really would like you there, but part of the reason why we were arguing was...\"\n\"Your sister Diana hates my guts.\" You interrupt.\n\"Well...I admit she\u0027s not fond of you, but I mean I think we can work past that. She\u0027s just going to have to accept that I\u0027m with you now.\"\n\"But is she REALLY going to do that? Or am I going to find her hovering over me in the middle of the night with a knife in hand?\"\n\"She\u0027d have a hell of a time sneaking in our room without waking me up first of all. Second, if I lay down the law to her, she\u0027s got no fucking choice BUT to accept it. I\u0027M the head of the family after all and as head of it, my word is divinely inspired by Tiamat herself and to go against Tiamat is a blasphemy that even Diana would not do. So to sum up, you might have to hear some shit from her, but your physical well being is perfectly safe.\"\n\n\"Safe\" is a funny term to use for a guy who practices human sacrifice. Which is the other concern you have, since while you\u0027ve long since accepted certain aspects of Bobby\u0027s belief system, you\u0027d rather not see the gruesome details. Though you suppose that\u0027s just one more thing you\u0027re going to have to discuss.\n\nYou sort of wonder about the rest of Bobby\u0027s family though and how well you\u0027ll get along with them. He\u0027s got a family that\u0027s at least as big as yours was at one time, but you\u0027ve never really interacted with any of them (Bobby never had you over his house much due to Diana\u0027s hostility) except for Bobby\u0027s second oldest sister Helen who was polite, if quiet.\n\nJust as you\u0027re thinking about this, Bobby springs something unexpected on you.\n\n\"Since you\u0027re wanting to move in, I should tell you that we won\u0027t be living in the house in the neighborhood. We\u0027re going to be living in a compound north outside of town.\"\n\"Wait, what?\" You say.\n\"It\u0027s the Morningstar family compound. We\u0027re moving there, or rather we\u0027ve been in the process of moving all our stuff over there for the past few weeks. Never mentioned it since we were sort of arguing about other stuff.\"\n\"Wait, wasn\u0027t your house the Morningstar family compound?\"\n\"Heh, well that was certainly big enough for my immediate family, but I do have some extended family as well and given the current world climate, I had a video conference meeting with some of the extended family and most agreed that it might be best if we moved to the better fortified compound that my Dad had built over time decades ago.\"\n\"Holy shit, how many people are we going to be living with? I mean are we going to be restricted with what technology we can use, working a farm and the women have to put their hair up in a bouffant and wear simple clothing? If so then I can\u0027t deal with...\"\n\"What? No! Geez Suzy, we\u0027re worshippers of Tiamat, not the Amish or fucking Mormon fundies! No, we got all the conveniences of the modern world there and women can wear what they want, though there MIGHT come a day very soon when we will have to rely on farming of some sort, but I guarantee you won\u0027t be the one doing it.\"\n\nBobby continues.\n\n\"As for how many people are going to be living there, well that I\u0027m not sure. There aren\u0027t as many of us anymore and some live quite far away. Not everyone was jumping at the idea either, so some may decide to not bother to make the trip. In any case, at most it might be twenty more people and even then we\u0027ll have more than enough room there. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n\nEasy for him to say, he\u0027s not the one that\u0027s just had this new information sprung on him. Bobby correctly senses your silence as concern.\n\n\"I sense some concern.\" Bobby says.\n\"Fucking right you sense some concern! Not only am I still worried about your sister, I\u0027m now worried about even MORE of your... highly religious family. I mean how are the rest of them going to feel about you bringing in a non-believer?\"\n\"Oh I\u0027m not worried about that. I\u0027m confident you\u0027ll eventually see the colorful swirling chaos...or the light if you prefer.\" Bobby laughs.\n\"That\u0027s...... not exactly alleviating my concerns Bobby.\"\n\"Sorry, I\u0027m just joking to lighten the mood....\"\n\nYou hear Bobby exhaling deeply before continuing.\n\n\"Suzy, I know this is more shit for you to take in and I know you\u0027ve been very understanding about everything. It\u0027s one of the many reasons why you\u0027re so wonderful. I just want to stress that you won\u0027t be walking into some Jim Jones kool aid suicide cult compound. You\u0027ll be perfectly safe because you\u0027ll be with me, I\u0027m the chosen of Tiamat and like I said, my word is going to be law at the compound. Look, I\u0027ll be by to pick you up tomorrow to take you there. If you\u0027re not feeling it after a few days, well I\u0027m sure we can figure something else out. I want us to work out Suzy. I love you.\"\n\nThere is certainly no denying that Bobby feels very strongly about you. Again, while you still have reservations, you\u0027ve never known Bobby to lie to you. As for the rest, you do know Bobby\u0027s family take their religion pretty seriously so you know Bobby isn\u0027t exaggerating about you being safe with him. In fact if the threat of physical violence is gone, that actually already puts you ahead of your situation here considering Kelly has pushed you around and threatened to do more on many occasions.\n\n\"I feel the same way Bobby. Okay, I\u0027ll pack and I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\n\nBobby\u0027s voice sounds a bit more upbeat when you agree to go with him, though again if you had the option of staying home, you certainly would. Still, you\u0027re trying to maintain a positive open minded attitude about all this.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Bobby you waste no time in packing your most important belongings. As the night approaches, you finish up with your packing and get to sleep a little earlier. You get the feeling you\u0027re going to need all your energy for what lies ahead tomorrow.\n",
  "page 99": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the faint sounds of rustling. You look up from your bed and see Johnny getting dressed.\n\n“Where are you going?” you ask groggily.\n“I was going to get the stuff I brought in from the jeep and left up stairs on Thursday night. I know we’ve got more than enough stuff down here now, but I still thought you’d want your clothes which we don’t have any of down here.”\n“Oh. Okay, I’ll come with you.” You say.\n“No, stay here and relax, I got it.”\n“It’s okay really, I don’t mind. Besides, I still left things in my room that I’d like to get.”\n“You sure you want to do that with your sister’s body still in there?”\n“Oh yeah that’s right. Well I’ll just help you with the bags from upstairs then.”\n“Okay. Always enjoy your company anyway and don’t worry, I fully intend on cleaning up all the bodies upstairs, not just your sister’s. I mean know we’re going to be down here for a while, but you never want bodies just lying around to rot in your area. Never mind the smell, but there are also vermin and health hazards to consider.” Johnny says.\n\nWell he’d probably know better than most…\n\nYou and Johnny finish getting dressed and exit the shelter. From the basement you then head to the ground floor where you see your bags lying on the floor near the front door.\n\n“You said you brought these in on Thursday night?” you ask.\n“Yeah, after you fell asleep.”\n“I suppose it’s a silly question since you never seem to be scared of anything, but you weren’t concerned about those rabid things possibly wandering around at night?”\n“Oh I definitely was prepared in case of an attack, but the strange thing is, its dead silent in your neighborhood. Or at least it seems like it is. I didn’t see anything wandering around out there. Rabid or otherwise. If I had to guess, the National Guard exterminated everything in this area and moved on.”\n“Hm, well from what I’ve seen they’re getting their ass kicked elsewhere. I just hope that…”\n\nBefore you or Johnny can say anything else a bright flash shines through one of the uncovered windows along with the sound of a large explosion in the distance. You can’t help but take a quick glance out the window.\n\nAnd there you see it in the far distance, the dissipating remnants of a mushroom cloud rising up in the sky.\n\n“…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“…I have to say, I’m not entirely surprised. Johnny replies looking with you.\n“From the direction I saw the cloud, I’d say it probably hit Security City and that’s fairly far away. I know impact should’ve at least shattered the windows of the house had it been closer or bigger so it probably wasn’t even a large one. Still, we probably should still get down in that shelter.” You say.\n\nJohnny agrees and the pair of you grab all the bags and quickly head back down to the shelter.\n\n“Well, I guess it’s a good thing we decided to come back here instead of trying to leave town.” You say.\n“Yeah, I imagine things are going to be quite chaotic for a long time to come. It’s better that you’re safe down here.” Johnny says.\n“We’re both safe down here.” you say, but Johnny’s pacing suggests that he’s a bit preoccupied.\n\n“Okay, what’s wrong?” you ask.\n“Well, with this new event come to light, its already established that the situation just got a lot worse and isn’t going to be ending anytime soon. Now we’ve probably got a decades worth of supplies, possibly a little more since I don’t eat much anyway, but the fact remains, we’re going to need more supplies eventually and that means going up to the surface and dealing with it.” Johnny replies.\n“Yeah, I know. I didn’t really want to think about it, but you’re right of course. I think I saw some survival manuals in one of the rooms down here, guess I better read up on them.”\n“While I certainly wouldn’t stop you from getting yourself acquainted with such things, my thoughts are, why do you need to leave here and risk your life at all? I’ll be the one going up there.”\n“Well we are sort of a team now right? I mean don’t you want me to help you?”\n\nJohnny’s hands touch your shoulders as he stares into your eyes. His hands gently run down from your shoulders to your arms until he’s holding both of your hands.\n\n“Suzy, you were too good for this world when it wasn’t completely fucked up, you’re definitely too good for it now. As dangerous as it was in this past week, it’s going to be ten times worse now. It’s going to be chaos, anarchy and people killing each other for survival as well as pleasure. In short, it’s going to be a world that someone like me would thrive in. I actually belong out there.”\n\nJohnny then lets go your hands and raises his arms upward and looks up and around making motions with his hands pointing to the shelter in general.\n\n“And this, all this, is your world. This is all you have ever needed Suzy. Some place to feel safe. Some place locked away from the outside world. I mean you’re the honest one here, can you tell me sincerely that you really want to go out there scrounging around for supplies and having to deal with people wanting to rape you or kill you, or hell even eat you? Wouldn’t you rather someone else deal with it?”\n\nJohnny focuses his attention back to you. You look at him and you don’t even answer because your face is probably giving him his answer already. He’s absolutely right.\n\nYou don’t want to deal with reality. You never have. In fact you got along pretty well without having to for a very long time and whenever you have had to deal with it, it’s always been a stressful mess. He’s also right in that he’s far more suited to dealing with the shitstorm that the surface is going to be.\n\nAnd maybe that’s just one more reason why you didn’t kill Johnny. You knew he’d be willing to take care of you no matter what. It’s all you’ve ever wanted, for someone to just love and take care of you while you didn’t have to worry about a thing.\n\nYou move forward and put your arms back around Johnny and look into his eyes.\n\n“Just don’t killed okay?” you say.\n“Never. I’ll always be around to protect and take care of you Suzy. My love for you will always keep me going forever and ever and ever and ever.”\n\nThe way Johnny is looking at you while he strokes your hair each time for emphasis when he says “and ever” would probably be creepy to most, but you know its just his way of confirming his love you.\n\nYou’re so lucky.\n",
  "page 9": "The more you think about it, the idea of sleeping in possibly cramped quarters isn’t exactly appealing, not to mention Klepto said the place wasn’t the cleanest. If you lay down the law to Lifto, you’re fairly certain he won’t try anything.\n\n“Okay Lifto, get your stuff, you can stay over, but I think you know I don’t need to tell you to not try anything.”\n“Sure. Really, it’ll be nice just to stay some place less crowded for a change.” Lifto remarks and goes to trailer to get whatever it is he’s going to need for the night.\n\nKlepto looks a little disappointed, but says nothing and just meekly heads back to his trailer as well. You already can imagine how rumors are going to spread, but you really can’t worry about that now. You’re not going to worry about possible “hurt” feelings especially when you’re not involved with anyone here anyway.\n\nLifto and you soon head over to your trailer.\n\n“Haven’t really had a chance to completely clean up since I was given the place.” You mention.\n“Still cleaner than our place, and I’ve been over here a couple times when Ranko had it. Trust me it’s starting to look better already.”\n“(Yawn) Thanks. Man, didn’t realize I was getting so sleeping so quickly. I’m going to bed.”\n“Sure. I’m probably going to be awake for a little while longer, and eventually sleep on the floor.”\n“You sure you’re going to be okay? I mean I know you have to sleep as well.”\n“I’m sort of a light sleeper, so even when I do fall asleep, I’ll easily be able to wake up if someone even tries to pick the lock and creep in here. Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine.”\n\nYou settle down to sleep and speak about a few superficial things to Lifto about how you think you’re fitting in here and how you’re glad he’s staying here the night. He of course is very positive and tries to reassure you that it’ll just take awhile, but eventually the rest of the carnies will accept you.\n\nYou aren’t inclined to believe that, but it’s nice to hear before you fall asleep.\n\nAt some point in the night you’re awakened by Lifto noisily rushing to the door.\n\n“What the hell?” you utter still half asleep.\n“Suzy, stay where you are, some motherfucker’s trying to break in!” he shouts and with some sort of blunt object in hand he slams the door open. It doesn’t sound like he hit the person with the door, but you do hear a scuffle outside.\n\nYou look out the window and see who Lifto is fighting with and it’s an equally large man. It’s same creepy retard that was staring at you all day today. You knew it wasn’t going to be safe to be here alone.\n\nYou quickly look around for a weapon of your own to help Lifto. Hopefully with all the noise someone else from the carnival will come running to help. (You hope)\n\nGrabbing a knife you cautiously head towards the door still hearing the fighting between Lifto and the retarded hick. You open the door and see them both rolling on the ground. You can’t really help due to the retard not being still enough for you to be confident to stab at him, not to mention you’re really scared about this whole situation.\n\nNobody is out to help out either. You call out a couple times and you know it has to be loud enough for SOMEONE to hear now, but its like you’re not being helped on purpose.\n\nLifto and the retard are really going at it and unfortunately it’s starting to look like the retard is getting the upper hand. You really don’t want to leave, but you figure the best you can do is to go get help from the other clowns.\n\nYou turn to run and you manage to get to the end of your trailer, before someone trips you to the ground in the dark followed by a blunt object smashing you in the back of the head. You go unconscious immediately.\n\nWhen you wake up, you’re groggy, naked and firmly strapped to a medical gurney of some sort. You also have a ball gag in your mouth. The room you’re in looks to be some sort of basement with a bright light hanging overhead.\n\nThe stench of chemicals fills the air and to your left in a darker corner of the room you see a man in a doctor’s coat hovering over another gurney with a body on it.\n\nNaturally in such a state you start to panic and ineffectively struggle to get free. The “doctor” hears you and walks over to you.\n\n“Oh, you’re up. I’ll have to give you more sedative. When Jed and Hugo brought you in, I thought you were going to be a useless slab of meat like they normally bring in. I was glad they showed some restraint this time. Honestly I’m very surprised they just didn’t keep you themselves and have some good ol’ fashioned fun or at least a quick in out before handing you over, but Jed did mention something about having to haul ass from your carnival as quick as possible.”\n\nAs you continue to try to struggle and make muted sounds to cry out, the doctor begins fondling you and moving his hands to roam all over your body.\n\n“Mmmm, nice. Not as great as my sister, but then none of them ever are. If I had the time, I’d probably shove it in your vertical smile for a while, but sadly I don’t.”\n\nThe doctor goes over to a tray and grabs some sort of syringe he fully intends on use on you and you’ve gone from mere panic to sheer terror.\n\n“Really, you’re luckier than most that come through here. Normally I keep ‘em awake when I do my work, but I need you unconscious to take out those pretty eyes and other vital organs of yours. Wouldn’t want you thrashing about or blinking to cause me to cut them all up and making them useless.”\n\nYou watch helplessly as the needle goes into your arm. The tears run down your cheeks.\n\n“There we go. Won’t be long now. (Sigh) I swear it seems like I never get to enjoy my work any more though. I really would’ve liked to have fun with you. Oh well, I’ve got some other things to still look forward to.”\n\nYou drift into unconsciousness again and your life ends where you ironically spent most of your time.\n\nA basement.\n",
  "page 91": "In an act of desperation you lunge for the pistol, but Kelly easily anticipates your actions. She quickly grabs the weapon and manages to step on your hand in the process followed by her smashing the pistol into your head.\n\n“You dumb blonde bitch, I was gonna let you go too! What the…”\n\nWhat occurs next is a blur mainly because you’re still dizzy from getting hit in the head, but also because it happens so fast.\n\nJohnny bursts out of the closet with his rifle in hand, but Kelly already has a grip on you and managed to pull you up in an attempt to use you as a human shield.\n\nJohnny and Kelly scream at each other. Something about letting you go and something else about blowing your head off. Eventually it doesn’t matter because Johnny eventually feels he has no choice and if you’re going to get killed, then it should be him that does it.\n\nJohnny opens fire on you both, before Kelly can make good on her threats of killing you. Due to you soaking up several of the initial bullets, she actually manages to get off a couple of shots at Johnny, but whether she got him or not is irrelevant because you’re still lying dead on top of Kelly’s equally bullet ridden body.\n",
  "page 90": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“Wakey wakey sis.” You hear a voice say.\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and at first see what looks to be a man standing in front of you holding a shotgun. Then after the blur of your eyes clears a bit, you see that it’s your sister Kelly.\n\nLooks like she’s still hostile to you as well considering she’s pointing a shotgun at you. You don’t know why, but then has she ever needed a reason?\n\nYou look at your pistol on the floor near the couch you’re sleeping on and Kelly just shakes her head.\n\n“I guarantee you wouldn’t make it sis. I suggest you don’t even try…heh I doubt you’d have the balls to go through with it anyway. I have to admit when I came up here to get something from my room, I didn’t expect to glance over this way and see you sleeping here.”\n\nUp? Where the hell would she come “up” from? You’re in the basement now. Kelly’s blocking your doorway, but you think you can make out a glowing light source coming from the basement floor beyond. And then it hits you.\n\n“…he moved the fucking shelter entrance in the house? And it’s been right near my goddamn room all this time?” you ask.\n“Hey hey! It’s about time you used that blonde head of yours other than taking up space!” Kelly mocks.\n\nWell you know where the entrance is, but unfortunately you’ve got bigger issues now. Kelly pointing a shotgun at you is concerning to be sure and makes you think back to what you saw in the garage. Peter and the other man’s body. Their bodies were beaten and their necks were broken. Kelly certainly has the strength and the skill to do such a thing. Kelly’s always been hostile to you and barely civil to your other sibling, but to actually kill one…\n\n“When did you find out? When you killed Peter?”\n“Pfft. I’ve always known. Crazy old Ben thought he was being so sneaky moving the goddamn entrance around all the time, but I knew where the fuck it was nearly every time. He had just moved the entrance again a few days before he blew away his family and himself. I’m just surprised YOU never accidently found it given that you lived practically right near the fucking thing for years. If the entrance was any closer you would’ve been sleeping in the damn thing.”\n\nKelly continues to address you while briefly looking over her shoulder. You don’t know if she’s just being cautious or if she knows someone else is with you…and where is Johnny anyway?\n\n“As for Peter, that little faggot managed to find out where it was and thought he was going to hide out from the current shitstorm in it with his boyfriend or whoever that other faggot he was with. Had to convince him that he had to go, he didn’t listen and tried to resist and well you saw how that turned out.”\n\nKelly briefly moves a bit to her left in your doorway allowing you to briefly look to see if you see Johnny coming, but you see nobody. Kelly notices you looking though.\n\n“So where’s that little whore Donna? Heard you moved in with her. She come with you? Julie maybe? Both? How the fuck did any of you survive the week?”\n“I’m here by myself Kelly.”\n“Bullshit. SOMEONE is here with you. I can’t see a shrinking violet like you hauling your ass through a bunch of military patrols as well as those freaks. The fact that you’re wearing military fatigues tells me that SOMEONE helped you. I know damn well you didn’t kill someone yourself for them.”\n“It’s been a weird week Kelly. You never know what you’re capable of until you’re put into the situation.” You say in such a way that gives Kelly a bit of an eyebrow raise.\n\n“Oh? So…are you a killer now, little sister? Tell me, how did it feel when you did it?”\n“I threw up. I’m not a fucking psychopath okay?! It didn’t give me some thrill! I just did what I had to, to survive!” you exclaim.\n“Okay, okay, calm down there killer.” Kelly chuckles before getting serious again.\n\n“While this is enlightening and all, we really should be getting back to the matter at hand.”\n\nStill no sign of Johnny. Where the fuck is he?\n\n“So what’s next Kelly? You gonna kill me too?” you ask.\n“Don’t know sis…don’t know…severely thinking about it. I’ve never liked you. You’ve been a thorn in my side since you crawled out of mom’s vagina. Always having to be compared to how good and pretty you were and how bad and rotten I was despite the fact I was the one who was shouldering most of the responsibility in this fucked up family. What did you ever do except hide in the goddamn basement? Even now you left the house only to come crawling back here. Yep, I’ve thought about killing you on many, many, MANY occasions.”\n“Actually that wasn’t my initial intention. My initial plan was to drive out of this forsaken town. I only stopped here because my own vehicle was badly damaged and I had hoped to maybe get Peter’s car and some extra supplies before heading out again.” You say trying to stall for time.\n“Oh? Hmm, you’re just full of surprises today aren’t you? Well if that is true, you may have just bought yourself a bit of a reprieve sis…okay. What the hell, I’m in a good mood. I’m gonna let you walk outta here alive and you’re going to be thankful.”\n“I don’t suppose you’ll allow me to gather some supplies or let me have my gun will you?”\n“Hah, no. Wouldn’t want you getting any ideas of trying to shoot me, you being a killer now and all. In fact let me just take that pistol right now. Stay on that couch and keep lying in that prone position. Don’t you fucking move, or boom there goes your pretty little blonde head all over the place.”\n\nJohnny is still nowhere to be seen. Did he take off? Did you actually get abandoned by a fucking stalker? Is your luck really that bad?\n\nKelly now moves into your room, still pointing the shotgun at you, As she’s crouching down to pick up the pistol, there is a brief moment that she takes her eyes off of you.\n\nIt’s apparent that there will be no rescue; the only thing you can hope is that Kelly is going to keep her word and let you go unharmed. Of course you don’t really think that’s likely and part of you wants to grab for the pistol before she can.\n",
  "page 93": "It’s no good. You’d never manage to grab the pistol before Kelly. Even if you did, she’d probably manage to shoot you before you could shoot her. Fear and panic begins to well up inside you as you believe this is the beginning of the end.\n\nKelly picks up the pistol and smiles as she puts it in front of her pants. You look helplessly as she does this…and then that’s when your eyes wander to your closet.\n\nYou don’t remember shutting the closet door. In fact you never shut your closet door…\n\nAnd it’s opening right now.\n\nInstinctively you try to flatten your body and disappear into the crevasse of your couch as much as possible. You then place your arms up to your face.\n\n“What the hell are you doing? That’s not gonna…” Kelly starts to say and then she hears a creak.\n\nJohnny unloads several rounds into Kelly’s body and head. She doesn’t even have time to fully turn around. Pieces of her fly out from the exit wounds and she falls to the floor in a bloody mess still twitching a bit.\n\n“Shit. Shit. Oh Shit. Oh fuck. Fuck. Please oh God. Please.” You’re muttering to yourself the whole time, barely aware of everything else.\n\nJohnny walks over from the closet and kneels over to you.\n\n“It’s over Suzy. Calm down. It’s over. She’s dead. That bitch will never bully you again.” Johnny says grabbing one of your hands.\n\nYou calm down and look at Johnny. In that moment you don’t care about what he has done in the past or what he might do in the future. All you care about is that he was ultimately there for you when it counted.\n\nYou sit up and hug him, getting teary eyed in the process.\n\n“Oh god, I thought…I thought maybe…”\n“No, I was always there to protect you. I told you. I’ll always be here. You’re my perfect angel. You give my life…purpose.” Johnny replies hugging you in return and patting you on the back.\n\nJohnny also sniffs your hair as he’s hugging you at which point causes you to pull back a bit.\n\n“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. I just…” Johnny says.\n“It’s okay. I know. It was the moment.” You say trying not to make it too uncomfortable.\n\nWith you and Johnny done embracing, you stand up and look over at your sister’s body, which has stopped any sort of death twitch it might’ve briefly had.\n\nYou just stare at it silently. Johnny doesn’t even speak, he instead watches you looking at your sister. After about a couple of minutes of this, he finally speaks.\n\n“How do you feel?”\n“Honestly? I feel nothing. I don’t feel anger for what she did. I don’t feel guilt or even happiness that she’s dead. I just don’t feel anything for her anymore. She’s dead and that’s it. Just like Peter upstairs. Just like my Mom, my Dad, my whole family at this point. They’re all dead and I’m alive.”\n“Well, we don’t know about your sister Donna.” Johnny remarks.\n“She’s dead too. I know she is.” You say and look at Johnny who looks away and focuses back on Kelly’s body.\n\n“Well anyway, it looks like we know where the shelter entrance is now. Why don’t we check it out?”\n“Well that was the whole goal of this ordeal I suppose.” You say.\n\nJohnny exits the room and you grab your pistol back from Kelly’s body before leaving. Stepping out of your room you see the hatch in the floor wide open where the fluorescent glow of lighting coming from.\n\nYou take a look inside and see a long ladder down leading to another floor, which you imagine that’s the main shelter. You can’t believe how close it was to your room and how you never knew about it!\n\n“How the hell did you brother do this with you hearing or knowing about it?” Johnny asks.\n“I dunno. I mean he managed to routinely change the entrance all the damn time too. Ben had a gift I guess. Everyone does I suppose.” you say and you and Johnny start climbing down the ladder and you close up the hatch.\n\nEventually you get to the bottom and you and Johnny open up a metal door, which is fortunately not locked.\n\nAnd there it is, you’re in the shelter proper. Before you is a dimly lit living area with various furniture and even a TV. Other rooms include a bathroom, kitchen area, a couple of bedrooms and A LOT of storage rooms. One such room is huge, as rows and rows of canned food and bottled water are found.\n\n“Well looks like sustenance is plentiful. Doesn’t even look like Kelly put a dent in the supplies.” You say.\n\nAnother storage room contains a goodly amount of ammo and weapons of all kinds. Mostly rifles. Medical supplies are in another.\n\nOne thing that stands out is that Ben’s shelter has solid steel walls. You have no idea how the hell he did this and you guess you never will. You do notice on several of the walls something has been repeatedly scratched out though not entirely successfully everywhere.\n\nAt one point you make out most of it.\n\nPr-p---- o- th- Gr--n- -er- Cor---at-o-\n\n“Well, I guess spending thousands on one of those Ground Zero shelters would’ve been a waste of money for you Seems like you got a nice one for free.” Johnny says looking around.\n“Indeed. Now we need to talk about us Johnny.”\n\nJohnny turns to you and sees you’re holding your pistol directly at him. He doesn’t react with surprise or anger or anything. It’s nothing.\n\nAnd that’s the “real” Johnny right there. The one you’ve always known even when you weren’t quite sure.\n\n“So…what is this Suzy?” Johnny asks.\n“I don’t know yet. I really don’t. I wish I did. I wish I could make a decision. I wish I could be the killer my sister thought I was. This would be so much easier. On the other hand I also wish I could trust and just let go.”\n\nJohnny makes no move towards you. He just continues to stand there. You briefly wipe your eyes while still holding the pistol on him.\n\n“Johnny, you’ve been here for me this whole crazy week. I don’t think I would’ve survived if you hadn’t been around…but I know you. I know what you are.”\n“I never thought that you wouldn’t figure it out, you’re an intelligent woman after all which is matched only by your beauty of course.” Johnny replies.\n“Stop. Just stop.” You exclaim.\n\nYou tear up and sniffle for a moment and then address Johnny again.\n\n“My uncle Ed was a serial killer. We all sort of wondered, but it wasn’t until that fateful day when I decided to go snooping around where I shouldn’t have that I learned the awful truth. He caught me finding where he was storing body parts, but in his own twisted honorable way due to being related, he said he’d spare my life if I helped him kill someone. Kept saying I was pure and good, and not like the rest of those whores he killed.”\n\nJohnny’s eyebrows raise when you say this. Now he seems genuinely surprised.\n\n“In a more fucked up twist, he was feuding with a group of cultists into human sacrifice. Wanted me to help kill them. I initially did out of fear, but then I met Bobby during this mission. I ended up betraying my uncle because I felt that connection to Bobby because we both came from fucked up families. I thought it was love, and maybe it was, but it didn’t last obviously.”\n\nJohnny seems a bit overwhelmed by your new information.\n\n“That’s… some story Suzy. I have to admit, I never would have guessed…”\n“That what? That I’m not perfect? I’m not good? I’m not so pure? That I’m a backstabbing whore like all the rest?” you snap.\n\n“That…that wasn’t what I was going to say at all. Suzy, do you really think I could ever see you in that light?”\n“I…I don’t know Johnny. You’ve never told me much about your past. I mean I can piece things together by what you have told me and how you’ve acted. And that’s the problem I DON’T KNOW.”\n“Okay, Suzy, let’s just get it completely out in the open. What exactly is it that you think I’ve done or what I am?”\n“You’re a serial killer. I mean I don’t exactly know just how bad you are for certain and I can’t know for certain, but I do know you’re a killer. I’ve been studying you probably just as much as you’ve been studying me. I mean…Christ…I don’t KNOW if you killed Donna. I don’t KNOW if you killed Julie, but the more I think about it and how they just disappeared and the conclusion I come to isn’t pleasant. There’s also your own suspicious behavior, the incident with the soldier “falling” down the stairs, your rage when beating that guy’s head in, claiming that you’ve done bad things, stealing a jeep and most likely killing the owners in process, and finally your obsession with me. I’m quite familiar with your kind enough that even if I can’t prove some of this shit, I feel it in my heart that’s what you are.”\n“Well…if I am so terrible, then I suppose you should kill me.”\n“Goddamn it Johnny, if it was THAT FUCKING EASY I WOULD! But YOU KNOW it isn’t and I KNOW it isn’t! Because I also know underneath the fucked up social chameleon predator, I KNOW there actually IS a human being capable of love. I believe you really love me Johnny. I do. I don’t doubt it. The problem is, how can I fucking trust that it’s going to last?”\n\nJohnny has no answer. He just looks down.\n\n“Well see there’s my problem. How do I know that I’m not going to do something that’s going to set you off? Make you see me as fallen angel or a flawed person that is fit only for destruction? And this goes both ways Johnny, how do YOU know that I might not strike first? Granted I’m not a killer, but I still manipulated events to cause the death of my uncle. Can YOU really trust me, if I’m scared of you?” you say.\n\nJohnny at this point rubs his eyes and sniffles a bit. He’s not exactly crying, but he’s definitely having an emotional moment.\n\n“Suzy. I cannot think of anything more that I can do, that would convince you that I’ll love you forever and that I will always protect you. It’s true I have done bad things…it’s also true that I probably would be classified as a serial killer. I’m very sick Suzy. I have a lot of bad thoughts going on in my head most of the time and even though I can emulate emotions, they don’t feel genuine. It’s like I’m just a mask. But with you, it’s different. I haven’t felt this way towards anyone since…well my first love. I don’t really want to get into that right now, but I want to say it was a much different situation.”\n\nJohnny falls to his knees.\n\n“Almost everything I felt during my time with you this week was actually real to me. You made me feel like a normal person. Like I had at last found a purpose to my life. I love you Suzy. You can never fall off that pedestal. I know that this is difficult for you. I understand the alienation and mistrust you feel, perhaps in a different way, but I understand it. But I also know that you want to give us a chance, if you didn’t, you wouldn’t be struggling with this right now.”\n\nYou continue to point the pistol at Johnny as more tears roll down your cheeks.\n\n“Johnny…I know you’ve lied to me or been evasive about things this week. I’ve been nothing but truthful. If this has any chance of working. I need to know right now. (Exhale) Did you kill Donna and Julie?”\n“I thought you said you didn’t care what happened to them and that they abandoned you.” Johnny says.\n“And that may be the case because you FUCKING killed them! Now stop evading the fucking question and answer it!” you demand.\n\nJohnny looks at you. In fact it’s the most cold-blooded stare you’ve ever seen from him. It’s like when Uncle Ed looked at you in his van.\n\n“Would you believe me, if I said no?” he asks.\n“ANSWER!” you demand.\n“Very well. No, I didn’t.” Johnny says looking straight at you.\n",
  "page 95": "And with that lie you hear from Johnny, your head drops briefly in despair. With tears in your eyes you look back at Johnny.\n\n“I…don’t believe you…and if I don’t believe you, I can’t trust you. (sob) And if I can’t trust you…(sob) I…I…”\n“You have to kill me.” Johnny says for you.\n“I’m sorry…” you say.\n\nJohnny just stares at you and a tear actually comes down his left eye.\n\n“Nobody is ever going to love you like I will Suzy.”\n“That… I do believe.”\n\nYou then shoot Johnny. The first shot hits him in the body, causing him to fall backwards, but not enough to kill him, but you soon get over your shock and sorrow not just by remembering that he’s killed Julie and Donna, but that eventually he’ll kill you as well.\n\nYou don’t stop pumping rounds into the son of a bitch until the pistol is completely empty.\n\nJohnny’s body lies motionless in a bloody mess. His eyes still open, staring at you even in death.\n\nYou slump down on the floor crying that it had to be this way, but it was survival.\n\nAfter a few minutes of releasing your sadness, you realize that you can’t just leave Johnny’s body down here. The problem is you can’t very well carry it up the ladder from the shelter either, at least not in one piece.\n\nYou slowly get up and head back to the armory. There you find a good-sized machete that looks very sharp. You also get some garbage bags you saw in one of the supply rooms. You’re not sure why Ben had them down here, but it’s handy that he did.\n\nYou go back to Johnny’s body. You think about dragging the body to the shelter’s bathtub and doing your grisly work there, but you decide the best thing you can do is just to get it over with. You lay out some of the bags on the floor and roll Johnny’s body on to them and get to work.\n\nIt’s not an easy task for you and you get physically sick more than once, but eventually you get through it. Johnny’s limbs, torso and head all get put into bags. You then make several trips up and down the ladder to haul the pieces up to the basement. It’s still an exhausting task, even more so after having to go through hacking him up and the emotional drain you feel from it.\n\nYou don’t go any further than the basement after you’ve hauled all of Johnny’s parts up. You’re just not in the mood to deal with more. You look at the blood-drenched fatigues you’re wearing and strip them off to throw them into one of the bags.\n\nLeaving the “body bags” by the entrance, you go back to your room to get a spare set of clothes. You also see Kelly’s body still lying in a heap there. Just reminds you that you’ll have more cleaning up to do tomorrow.\n\nFor now though you grab something comfortable from the closet and head back down to the shelter where you take a long hot shower. Afterwards you go to the bedroom and collapse on the bed, completely spent.\n\nDoesn’t take long for you to fall asleep, it’s a welcome escape from reality.\n",
  "page 94": "And with those words that you hear from Johnny, everything in your mind just sort of shuts off.\n\nIt doesn’t matter. None of it does. You see that now.\n\n“Okay.” You say and put your pistol away.\n\nJohnny looks a bit uncertain, almost as if he was expecting you to shoot him.\n\n“Okay?” he asks.\n“Yeah, okay. If you’re telling me you didn’t kill them, then you didn’t kill them. In fact I don’t want to know about your past either. It’s just not important. You were there for me this week when nobody else was, that’s the important thing and that’s what I should place my faith in.”\n\nJohnny slowly gets up off his knees. He doesn’t approach you right away; instead he just continues to stand at a distance.\n\n“I apologize for my earlier outburst Johnny. I just, well it’s been a stressful week. You understand.” You say.\n“Yeah….yeah I get it. Don’t worry about it. I’m fine.” Johnny says.\n“Good. Good. Well, let’s move on to other matters shall we?”\n“Yeah.” Johnny says.\n\nSuddenly Johnny rushes at you and grabs you tightly. While one arm is firmly around your waist, one hand moves up to your neck and you feel a gentle squeeze as he looks into your eyes. It’s the look of a predator that has finally caught his prey.\n\n“Well? What are you waiting for lover? I trust you.” you say not resisting.\n\nJohnny’s hand moves from your neck and to your face, where upon he strokes your cheek gently.\n\n“You have the face of a perfect angel.” he whispers and then he moves in to kiss you.\n\nAs your lips touch, he begins to take your clothes off in a hasty fashion. He’s definitely getting aggressive, but oddly you’re not quite feeling his “enthusiasm” yet…\n\nBy the time you get pushed over towards the bed and are basically in your bra and panties, he still isn’t quite “ready.”\n\n“Do you need some help?” you ask.\n“No, I’ll be fine...” He says as he tries to get it up.\n\nWhile you take off the remainder of your clothes Johnny’s still having difficulties.\n\n“Look I can help you out, I don’t mind going down on…”\n“Shhh! No! I don’t want you debasing yourself like a whore! I just need to focus!” Johnny snaps.\n“Okay. Okay.” You say and back off.\n\nYou lie down on the bed and try not to stare in an effort to not look judgmental. This is really awkward though.\n\nJohnny starts swearing, as his buddy is not doing what he wants it to do. Swearing turns to shouting and then finally a complete breakdown.\n\n“Shit! I wanted this to be so perfect. I wanted to be everything for you, not some fucking impotent eunuch!” he says sniffling a bit.\n\n“Hey, calm down. It’s okay. You’re trying too hard, you just need to relax.” You say moving over to caress him a bit.\n“I know. (sniffle) This just has never happened before.” Johnny replies.\n“Well, you probably aren’t used to…uh situations like this. I mean would it help if I pretended I was dead or something?”\n“What? No. That doesn’t work. Your body is too warm and submerging you in cold water would be really uncomfortable for you.” Johnny says.\n\nAs you continue to try to make Johnny feel more at ease, he slowly speaks.\n\n“Suzy…there is something I can think of…but…you’re not going to want to do it…”\n“Does it involve pain?” you ask.\n“No.”\n“Then go ahead and say it.”\n“Could…could you pretend that we’re related?” Johnny asks.\n\nWhy are you not surprised?\n\n“Ah. I see. So you want me to role play as your mother?” you ask going for the obvious serial killer obsession.\n“Hah, no. You’re a bit too young for that, I don’t think I could maintain the illusion, but… um maybe you could be my sister?”\n\nWow, a murderous boyfriend who fucked his sister in the past, it’s like being with Bobby all over again…and there’s something vaguely comforting about that. You always did prefer something familiar to something new.\n\nYou smile and caress Johnny’s face.\n\n“Of course brother dear.” You say and passionately kiss Johnny.\n\nFrom there things get a lot better. Johnny actually is a pretty sensual lover when he gets going. You guess he must’ve loved his sister just like you once loved Bobby a lot.\n\nJohnny falls asleep shortly afterwards professing his usual love for you. After being awake a little longer yourself thinking about what the future might hold, you go to sleep.\n",
  "page 97": "Repression of Reality\n\n\nThe Future...\n\n“I’m home!” you shout as you enter the shelter loaded with goodies.\n\nAs you unburden yourself of your haul, you hear the end credits of a movie playing on the TV.\n\n“See? I told you I wouldn’t be that long. I got here just in time to put on another movie! In fact I got some new ones from that redneck encampment. I know most of them are a bunch of assholes, but they’re always up for trading and that Mel guy keeps ‘em mostly in line. Plus they got bigger things to worry about now that they’re at war with the Cult of Tiamat.”\n\nYou open up your bag and go through some of the DVDs you picked up in trade. You pick one and exchange it out for the one that was playing.\n\n“I haven’t seen this one in a long time. I’m glad we’ll be able to watch it together.” You say.\n\nAs the movie starts playing you return to unloading your bags occasionally looking up to watch the movie playing.\n\n“So speaking of the Cult of Tiamat. I meant to tell you I…uh…ran into Bobby a few days ago.”\n\nYou unpack some of the canned food you found. Sure you still have tons of food to last for years, but it never hurts to have more.\n\n“See? This is why I didn’t tell you! I knew you were going to get mad! I wasn’t trying to hide it, I just…well you know how your temper is and I didn’t want you getting all jealous and screaming at me.\n\nYou finish unpacking the rest of your bags and place most of the items on the table where you plan on going through a complete inventory later, right now though you just want to relax. You strip down to your underwear and sit on the couch to watch the movie playing.\n\n“One of my favorite parts is coming up...(sigh) are you still mad? Look I told you, nothing is going on with Bobby and me! Just because that bitch Diana is dead doesn’t mean I’m going to get back with him! Bobby’s got other sisters you know? Besides, he’s pretty much firmly entrenched in his beliefs now. I only think he’s cordial with me, because we once had something. I mean being friendly isn’t a crime. I mean it’s a good thing. One less person for me to worry about blowing my head off.”\n\nYou briefly glance over at the TV before returning to your argument.\n\n“Oh that’s fucking low. Don’t you think I wish it didn’t have to happen? I wish every day that things could’ve been different, but you know what? They weren’t, so you need to just fucking deal with it!” you shout and get so angry that you punch the mannequin positioned on the sofa and its head falls off and tumbled to the floor.\n\n“Shit. Oh shit. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Let me help you.” You say and scramble to pick up the head.\n\nYou reattach the head and inspect it for damage; fortunately you didn’t do any save for a minor loss of paint near the ear.\n\n“Hold on…there. Not so bad. Look I’m sorry I got angry, but you shouldn’t have said that to me. You know I still feel bad about that. I don’t want you throwing that back in my face okay?”\n\nYou kiss the mannequin on the cheek and cuddle up next to it while holding one of its hands.\n\n“I accept your apology too. Like I said, you really shouldn’t get so jealous. You know you’re the only one for me. Let’s just finish watching the movie together, then maybe later, who knows?” you say and giggle a bit.\n\nYou finish watching the movie as planned, and then afterwards you take your companion to the bedroom where you have an interesting time with certain attachments that you’ve made to him.\n\nAfter relieving your tension you roll over next to your companion and turn your head to look at it. You still can’t believe how you stumbled upon one that looked a little similar to him.\n\nSometimes you wonder about your sanity and if one day you’ll just completely lose yourself in your made up world, but then you think you never did before no matter how hard you tried. And you certainly won’t now, besides what’s a little retreat from reality every now and then?\n\n“Goodnight Johnny.” You say and kiss him before going to sleep.\n",
  "page 96": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to silence and it’s an odd feeling.\n\nYou half expect Johnny to be vacuuming or cleaning or just being around, but you know that’s not going to happen ever again.\n\nYou sit up just thinking about what you’re going to do today for a few moments. Everyone you know or close to is gone and you’re truly alone now. Granted you’ve spent most of your life alone, but there was still always someone around to intrude. Most of the time this was unwanted like when Kelly bullied you or when Peter stole your clothes. Other times this was your choice like spending time with Bobby.\n\nNow? There is nobody.\n\nYou finally get up and shuffle into the living room which still has a lot of blood on the floor.\n\n“(Sigh) I guess I should clean that up too.” You mutter to your self and remind yourself to get some of the cleaning products from upstairs.\n\nAfter ascending up the ladder you see the same garbage bags you left in a group nearby.\n\n“I’ll be back to take care you later Johnny.” You say, then you glance your head towards your old room.\n\n“You too bitch.” You say and head upstairs.\n\nWhen you get upstairs to get something to clean with, you notice several bags on the floor in the living room. They’re yours or mostly yours anyway. It’s all the stuff you brought with you from Julie’s house. Johnny must’ve brought them in from the jeep last night. He always was thoughtful.\n\nAs you go to get your bags, a bright flash shines through one of the uncovered windows along with the sound of a large explosion in the distance. You can’t help but take a quick glance out the window.\n\nAnd there you see it in the far distance, the dissipating remnants of a mushroom cloud rising up in the sky.\n\n“…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n\nFrom the direction it looks like it probably hit the city, but it still had to be a “small” one since you imagine your home still would’ve suffered a backlash of your windows breaking from the long range impact.\n\nStill who knows which way the wind is blowing and there is no reason to not be extra cautious. So you gather up your bags and a few extra items and head back down to the shelter as quick as possible.\n\nAnd once again you’re locked away from the outside world. This time possibly for a lot longer than average. Sadly, you know it can’t be forever.\n\nAs you look through your supplies, you think you could probably stay down here for about a decade before you completely ran out of what you needed, which means eventually you’ll have to go up to the surface at some point to scavenge or trade or whatever it is that you’ll need to do for more supplies.\n\nAnd if you go up to the surface, you’re going to need to be prepared and that unfortunately means a lot of regular use for that exercise room you saw, along with reading all those survivalist books you saw in the library.\n\nStill, this week has already prepared you in some ways. You have a much better mindset to deal with the outside world that you can’t hide away from anymore. You even know that you can do unpleasant things if you need to.\n\nIt’s not going to be easy and it’s not going to be fun, but for now you can continue to afford to hide out from reality, if only for a little while longer.\n",
  "page 150": "This is different than the police or the military, these things are mindless, possibly crawling with disease and seemingly without end, you really do need to get out of here!\n\n“Donna, get the hell out of there! These things are gonna overrun the place!” you shout and begin pulling at her arm.\n“Wha…Suzy, lemme go! It’s not safe out there!” Donna says attempting to pull away from your grip.\n\nJimmy Ray is doing his best at blasting the cannibal freaks, but he’s not exactly using the quickest of weapons and those things are definitely picking up their own speed.\n\n“OH MY GOD! SUZY!” Donna exclaims pulling away just in time for one of those things to suddenly lunge upon you which you don’t see due to it jumping on your back and tackling you to the ground.\n\nYou hear snarling and gnashing in your ear and somewhere between that, you hear Jimmy Ray yelling at Donna to lock the front door.\n\nThe next thing you hear is the crunching sound of teeth going into your flesh. You cry out, but the freak is placing all its weight upon you, preventing you from struggling too much. With your face in the dirt and blood spurting out of your neck you’re not going too far, though when you’re partially hit with buckshot from Jimmy Ray’s shotgun you’re at least put out of your misery from the thing eating you alive.\n",
  "page 271": "Even if you made a dash for the door, you don’t think you’d make it before Trent’s friends would reach you, better that you help Jake.\n\nYou rush over to Jake and also grab Trent’s hand that is still clutching the pistol. Jake and Trent are also hitting each other, though Jake can’t really get a good hit in due to the counter being in the way and Trent being tall and having a long reach. Trent maintains a vice like grip on the pistol.\n\n“Hey you motherfuckers come help me! Fat ass and this bitch are trying to get the gun!” Trent exclaims.\n\nJake seeing that you have a grip on Trent’s pistol hand, Jake releases one of his hands to try to pull Trent forward over the counter.\n\nHe succeeds easily and Trent is half way over the counter, though two of his buddies manage to grab ahold of his legs and waist.\n\nMeanwhile Trent’s third friend has jumped over the counter and grabbed on to you. It’s mister pimple and he’s more like groping you rather than just trying to pull you off of his buddy.\n\nIn your attempt to get the little perv off of you end up letting go of Trent’s pistol hand and while Jake still has a partial grip on it and is currently punching Trent in the face with his other fist, Trent manages to at last get his finger back around the trigger and starts shooting.\n\nOf course he’s firing wildly due to getting punched in the face and still not having complete control over his gun, but unfortunately you’re close enough and in the direction he happens to pull the trigger.\n\nYou catch two in the chest and his buddy groping you gets one in the throat. The pair of you fall to the floor, him gurgling and spiting up blood and you struggling to breathe and also coughing up blood.\n\nYou die in a bloody heap on top of some acne ridden virgin that still manages to be clutching your right tit even in death.\n",
  "page 270": "It’s not exactly the bravest thing to do, but then your own life is at risk and if there is a chance at getting out of this mess now then you’re going to take it.\n\nYou jump over the counter and rush towards the door; two of Trent’s friends try to intercept you until Trent demands that they help him and forget about you. His third friend however ignores him and continues after you.\n\nYou manage to make it half way out the door before pimple boy grabs your arm.\n\n“You’re not going anywhere blondie, except on my dick!” pimple boy shouts and follows that up with a really creepy annoying giggle.\n\nYou pull away and get out of the store, but he’s a persistent bastard and manages to grab you around the waist from behind.\n\n“Come on baby, I like an older woman like you!” he exclaims in his attempt to grope your breasts while dry humping you.\n“Older woman like me? Motherfucker…” you exclaim and elbow the scrawny fucker in the face. It gets him off of you and then you spin around to give him a swift kick to the balls. Twice.\n\nHe falls to the ground crying and holding his crotch. He tries to mumble some curses at you, but it’s hard to do in between the tears. As much as you want to get out of here, you’re so pissed you kick him in his acne-ridden face for good measure, before running off. Just in time too, since you hear two gunshots coming from the store.\n\nYou turn the corner to the parking lot and rush to your car to open the door, then suddenly hear footsteps closing in quickly behind you.\n\n“Gimme that car bitch! I gotta get the fuck outta here!” you hear a voice shout. You don’t even turn your head since you already can tell it’s the voice of one of the teenagers from the store.\n\nYou get in the car and start it up. You pull out and are already in the process of driving off until the same teenager gets in front of the car and throws a brick at your driver window\n\n“SHIT!” you shout before the brick smashes through the window and hits you in the side of the head.\n\nYou lose complete control of the car and promptly crash into a nearby telephone pole. Thanks to shitty air bags not working properly you hit your already injured head against the driver’s wheel. Somehow you’re still conscious, but you’re incredibly dazed and woozy. You’re also not exactly feeling like moving too far, however your feelings are not in consideration here.\n\n“Get outta the car bitch!” the teen who threw the brick exclaims and opens the door to get you out of it.\n\nHe starts to drag you out and despite your less than stellar state you still make an effort to fight. Eventually with some effort he drags you out and then you fell a kick to your ribs while on the street pavement.\n\nBleeding, bruised, and dizzy you attempt to get up, only to not quite make it. Just when it looks like the teen is going to land another kick to you, a shot rings out and the teen falls to the ground nearly on top of you.\n\n“ARGH! SHIT! FUCK! I CAN’T FEEL MY LEGS! NO!” the teen screams.\n\nYou crawl away from the teen and through your blurry vision you see a figure coming towards you. It’s the stranger from the comic shop. The fact that he has a pistol in hand isn’t exactly encouraging despite the fact that he just shot your assailant.\n\n“You alright? You okay?” he asks running over to you.\n“Yeah, I just…I need some…help up…” you remark.\n\nUsing him and the car as leverage you manage to get back on your feet. The teen is still screaming at you and the strange from his prone position.\n\n“Can you stand on your own?” the stranger asks.\n“Yeah, I think…” you reply.\n“Okay then.” The stranger says and then kicks the teen in the face a couple times shutting him up.\n\n“Last thing we need is that dickhead bringing the attention of the cops that are a few blocks up.”\n“I dunno, the gunshots might have already done that or maybe they don’t give a shit just like everyone else in this town…fuck…” you say holding the side of your head.\n“You might be right, but we need to get out of the area I think, it doesn’t look like your car is going too far, my car is still in the parking lot. I can take you to get that head injury looked at.”\n\nBetween everything that’s happened, you’re not exactly thinking straight or at all except about the pain you’re in.\n\n“Yeah. Yeah. Whatever, let’s go.” You remark feeling wobbly.\n“Okay, I’ll help you along the way. My name is Jack by the way.” The stranger says.\n“Suzy.” You say.\n\nJack helps you back to the parking lot as quick as you’re able to move. You don’t see any signs of the cops coming, though you’re hearing other gunshots in the distance so maybe bigger things are happening elsewhere.\n\nEventually you get back to the lot and approach a small blue car.\n\n“Okay, let me open the door and you can just lay in the backseat.”\n“Sure…” you say and lean against the car, while he opens up the driver’s door and then unlocks the door to the backseat.\n\n“Hey…where were you? You…you kill those guys?” you ask.\n“Hiding within a small back niche where all the old comics were, in the hope of ambushing one of them. I might have done so, had your boss not riled them up enough to rush him. I came out and you were already gone. I smashed the fat one in the back of the head with a metal comic character statue. After he went down I tried to help the owner. He got shot before I could grab the gun from the tall one and then it was reflex response that I shot him.” Jack replies.\n\nJack opens the back door for you and you get in and lay down while Jack closes the door and then gets in the driver’s seat.\n\n“That one I know is dead since I shot him right in the head. I was sort of in shock for a moment since I’ve never killed another person before. The other teen had already run by the time I snapped out of it. I came out and I saw what was going on with you and I just reacted again. I dunno if I killed the others. I mean maybe I just knocked the fat one out and the other one when I kicked him in the face. Although I guess I paralyzed him for sure.” Jack says.\n\nJack pulls out of the parking lot and your lids are starting to get heavy.\n\n“You kill pimple boy? I left that asshole in a heap outside the shop.” You ask.\n“Um, no. I didn’t see him when I came out. Guess he ran off?” Jack answers.\n“Wish I’d killed him. Little fucker…ah, shit…”\n“Hey, I’ll help like I said so just hang in there okay?”\n“Yeah…okay…” you start to say.\n\nWithin the next five minutes all you hear is Jack swearing and making exclamations of how everyone is driving like an asshole or acting crazy. You can feel the car swerving back and forth when you guess that Jack must be avoiding various things on the wrong.\n\nAt some point as you’re drifting in and out of consciousness. You hear Jack swear some more about how he can’t get to the hospital because the entire area is barricaded and part of the hospital is even on fire.\n\n“Fuck! Suzy! You still with me?!” he asks.\n“Huh? Yeah…” you answer groggily.\n“I can’t take you to the hospital, but I can still get you help. You trust me?”\n“Well I’m not really in any condition to not trust you I suppose.”\n“I’m not a serial killer or anything I swear.” Jack says.\n\nYou start chuckling at that proclamation. For one thing his name is Jack, which is a bit on the nose for a serial killer. For another if this guy actually did turn out to be one; it pretty much would be in line of your run of luck lately. Hell, if you’re REALLY lucky, he’ll probably be your next boyfriend because you’re certainly fucked up enough to fall for someone like that.\n\n“Bet you say that to all the girls.” You say while still chuckling.\n“Is there any way I can convince you? I mean…if you don’t trust me, I understand. I suppose I could try to take you home if you told me how to get there, but given how fucked up this town is getting, I’m not sure if…” Jack start to say until you interrupt him.\n\n“Jack… just take me to wherever it is you’re going to take me. I truly don’t care at this point because I don’t even really have a home to go back to now. I’ve been having a shitty week, I just lost the only job I ever had, I got groped by some fucking asshole, my fucking head is bleeding, I think I got glass embedded in my face, my body aches, and I’m this close to just falling unconscious. So like I said, if you got anything sinister in mind for me, I’m not exactly in any position to stop you. Just drive.” You say as the sleep is starting to take you.\n\nJack doesn’t say anything and just begins reversing the car and swinging it around. You hear something hit the back windshield, not enough to break it though. Sirens and the general sounds of chaos can be heard throughout the drive.\n\nYou have no idea where Jack is going to take you or even if he’s going to make it wherever he has in mind. All that encompasses your mind is the slumber that eventually wins you over.\n",
  "page 152": "Given that you’ve been attacked by military, as well as a bunch of cannibal freaks… well sticking around here is looking a lot less desirable now and Donna’s idea is looking a lot more enticing.\n\nPlus if you were planning on ripping off this place and running off, this would be the best time to do it while everyone is a bit disarray and Mel and the better defenders of this place are gone.\n\n“Okay Donna I’m with you on this, but we really gotta do this shit quick.” You say.\n“Well of course. Like I said, you run over to our trailer and grab my bag and your own and rush back over. By the time you’re done, I should have found Jimmy’s keys and whatever else he’s got here that looks interesting.” Donna replies.\n\nYou and Donna nod at the agreement of this plan then you slip out of the trailer and try to keep a low profile. It really isn’t difficult since the few people walking around don’t even know you and seem to be busy cleaning up the dead freaks lying on the ground. You do spot Tina, however and deliberately avoid her since if anyone is going to attempt to hold you up for any reason, it would likely be her.\n\nWhen you get to your trailer, you pack what items and clothing you can in your bags, zip ‘em up and then sling one over your shoulder then with your free hand you go into the bedroom and grab Tina’s bag.\n\nYou leave your trailer and try to make it over to Jimmy’s as quick as you can.\n\nYou get half way there and then you hear a familiar voice…\n\n“Hey blondie! Knew you survived, where the hell ya been, there’s fuckin’ work to do. Need all the help we can moving these fuckin’ bodies.” Tina shouts.\n\nYou silently say “shit” to yourself and slowly turn around thinking up a lie that won’t attract too much suspicion, while at the same time is going to allow you avoid whatever work Tina had in mind for you.\n\n“Oh hey Tina. I’ve been…um just trying to recover from that recent attack just like everyone else. It was all sort of discombobulating you know?” you say.\n“Discom…what the fuck? Whatever, you don’t look hurt, so yer ass is needed to help move some bodies…and what’s with all the bags?” Tina asks.\n“Well, my sister Donna…”\n“Yeah where the fuck is Donna? She ain’t bit is she? Cause they put all those fuckers in a separate trailer. Even though I think they should just shoot the infected bastards. We all know how those movies go!” Tina interrupts.\n“Uh, no. She’s fine. Well not fine…”\n“Speak fucking plain blondie!”\n“My sister isn’t hurt physically, but she hasn’t handled the recent attack very well…she’s a wreck actually. Hysterical one moment, silent shock the next. Took me awhile to calm her down. She says she’d feel safer staying with Jimmy Ray, so that’s why I got all these bags with her stuff. I’m taking them over there.”\n“Donna broke down? Always thought she was miss cool, calm and collected and got over shit fairly quickly…hmmm, guess a few days sober in the face of brutal reality might break someone normally living in a drug, alcohol and sex fueled fantasy realm. I don’t remember her having all that shit. In fact aren’t some of those your bags?”\n“Yeah, she never brought that many clothes and I figured she could borrow some of my stuff. Figured I’d let her choose while I continued to talk with her. I mean I can still help with body moving thing, but I just really need to go help my sister first.”\n“(Sigh) Fine. No point in having a hysterical bitch making life miserable with bouts of screaming. Do what you need to do, but as soon as yer done, you help out with moving these bodies.”\n“Got it. I’ll really try to be quick.” You say.\n\nAfter parting company with Tina, you continue to head over to Jimmy’s as quick as you can where Donna is sitting on a chair waiting for you.\n\n“Would’ve been quicker, but I had to talk my way out of moving dead bodies with Tina.” You say.\n“It’s fine, here.” Donna says and takes her bag while thrusting a pistol into your hand. “It’s the only one I could find. You might as well take it, since you’re obviously more experienced with shooting than I am by now.”\n“Well thanks I guess. You got the keys too I trust?”\n“Yep, truck’s right next to this trailer. Though getting out isn’t going to be as quick as I’d like due to the way its parked, but we’ll just deal with that as it comes. You ready?”\n“Let’s do it.”\n\nYou and Donna run out of the trailer and turn the corner where Jimmy’s truck is parked. Donna was right about how it’s parked. Somehow he managed to wedge it between his trailer and the neighboring one pretty good. Donna’s going to have to do a lot of reversing and forward driving to get it out, but you’re wondering if you’re going to have time for all that.\n\nThrowing the bags in the back of the pick up, Donna gets into the driver’s seat and quickly unlocks the passenger sider before starting up the truck. DOesn’t take long before Donna’s bashing the hell out of the front end AND the back end of the truck against the trailers, attempting to get it out of it’s parking space.\n\nIt also doesn’t take long before several people hear this noise.\n\n“HEY! THOSE TWO BITCHES ARE TRYING TO STEAL ONE OF OUR TRUCKS!” a voice shouts.\n\nSeveral of the trailer park residents attempt to rush at the truck at first, but after you fire a few shots at them, they retreat and re-think that plan.\n\n“Donna come on! We ain’t got much time before they go and get their guns and start firing back!” you shout.\n“I know! I know! Fuck! Shit! This truck is really wedged in!” Donna shouts.\n\nThe scraping of metal and the continued destruction of the truck’s front end is in full force as Donna decides to just give the truck a hard turn in an attempt to escape. It works and you’re soon free, now you just have to drive out of the vicinity of the trailer park altogether because now bullets are damaging the truck.\n\n“Shit!”\n“Just get to the road Donna and drive west!” you shout.\n“It should be just a little, oh fuck!” Donna shouts as suddenly hits one of the rednecks with the truck. In fact she ran right over her.\n“Go! Go! Just fucking go!” you shout ducking your head down as another bullet breaks the back window.\n\nSoon, Donna manages to get back on the road though there are a few more shots fired in your direction.\n\n“Goddamnit, I think they hit the tires! This thing’s getting hard to control!” Donna shouts.\n“Well we’re going to have to ride the rims, because we’re not out of danger yet.” You reply.\n“Got that right bitch!” a voice suddenly says and then a large arm with a hook comes through the broken back window.\n\nYou’re startled enough by this unexpected event that you fumble with your pistol and drop it on the floor. As you scramble for the pistol, Donna screams and attempts to simultaneously keep control of the vehicle as well as not get impaled with a large metal object.\n\nWhen you finally get the pistol, an elbow goes into your face and a hand tries to grab your weapon. Donna slams on the breaks, which causes this unwanted hitchhiker to lose her grip on you and fall backwards a bit though she manages to hang on by embedding her hook into the front seat of the truck. Still, it’s just enough time for you to gain the advantage.\n\nYou swing around to turn to your attacker and see an angry looking woman with a buzz cut before you shoot her. At this range you don’t miss and half of her face is blown off before she releases her grip from the hook and her body falls backwards towards the tail end of the truck bed.\n\n“She’s dead, get us the hell outta here before the rest catch up!” you shout seeing a few people coming from the trailer park.\n“Holy shit, who the hell was that and how the hell did she sneak into the truck bed?!” Donna says flooring the gas.\n“Dunno, doesn’t matter, like I said, get us the hell outta here!”\n\nDonna’s a little shaken up from all this, but keeps her cool and by the time you put a lot of distance between you and the trailer park she’s a lot calmer. Still, you’re concerned that someone is going to give chase in another vehicle.\n\n“Fuck, that was intense.” Donna exclaims.\n“Yeah, well I knew it wasn’t going to be easy when you suggested it.”\n“Still, we did it though. When me and you work as a team we seem to overcome all odds.” Donna says in a slightly upbeat tone.\n“Well so far things have worked in our favor. Sort of worried about how far we’re actually going to get in this truck though. We’ve got at least one damaged back tire and who knows if they’re going to pursue us in their own vehicles.” You say.\n\nAt this point you continue to look behind you to see if anyone is following, but happily you don’t see anyone. You and Donna don’t say much for the next few miles. Maybe it’s because neither of you really knows what’s going to come next. You’re in a rural area with a truck that may or may not be drivable for very long. Neither of you has any money or anything really to barter with if you needed to fix it in someway. Well there is ONE thing you both have, but you’re not exactly willing to do that. (Though you imagine it wouldn’t be a problem for your sister)\n\nIf anything, your mindset has gotten a bit on the darker side of things due to the past few days. If the world is indeed going the way of chaos, you’re starting to think why not embrace it? You have a gun, and so far you’ve come to the conclusion that they’ve been solving a lot of problems for you.\n\nAs you dwell on these thoughts, your sister suddenly speaks.\n\n“Hey Suzy, there’s a group of tents up ahead. Looks almost like a circus or something. I thought I heard someone mention at the trailer park about one up this way. Should we stop and see if we can get help there?” Donna asks.\n“Hmm, nah. We should keep going. We still need to put more distance between us and that damn trailer park. Besides, I doubt if a bunch of carnies is going to be much better than a bunch of rednecks.” You answer.\n\nDonna nods and continues to drive. Leaving you to your thoughts, which are now starting to envision improving your situation by robbing some idiot of their belongings.\n\nYou turn the radio on in an attempt to find something to keep your mind occupied, but its mostly Ground Zero commercials. You get a few doomsday religious preachers too, which is even worse. You turn off the radio in dismay and return to your introspection until Donna speaks up again.\n\n“Hey Suzy?” Donna asks.\n“Yeah?” you reply.\n“Do you think the world is going to end?”\n“I dunno. Maybe. Though as far as I’m concerned, it already ended for me when I had to leave my basement.”\n“Yeah…I suppose it would. Hey, if you want we could turn around and go home. You could take back your basement and shoot Kelly in the face.”\n\nYou chuckle a bit at that suggestion.\n\n“That’s definitely a tempting idea. I think we’re better off driving into the unknown though. Like you said, when we work as a team, it somehow works out for us.” You say which Donna returns your sentiment with a smile.\n\nEventually the day starts turning to night and you start to get tired. The stress of the day has finally caught up with you. Surprisingly Donna’s still alert. So far the truck hasn’t given any problems though you know you’re riding on a flat (or at least low) back tire by this point.\n\nYou honestly don’t know what you’re going to do next, but for now you’re going to try to get some rest as you drift off to sleep…\n",
  "page 273": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\nYou wake up and find yourself on a small bed in a gray concrete room. There isn’t much else in the room except a dresser and a lamp which is currently turned on. It almost feels like a cell except there is no door, just an entryway, which looks like it leads into a corridor.\n\nYou sit up and find that you’re still fully clothed, so either Jack isn’t a serial killing rapist or he was enough of a gentleman to put your clothes back on exactly right after he was done and is now playing mind games with you. Your girl parts and ass don’t feel sore and you don’t have a bad taste in your mouth so you’re guessing that you weren’t violated in any way. (You hope)\n\nHowever the rest of your body certainly still aches from the kicks and physical abuse you took yesterday, but when you go to touch your head, you don’t feel any bandages like you were expecting. In fact, you aren’t even feeling any open wound that you’re sure that you probably had. The side of your face doesn’t feel to be scratched up either. Is Jack some sort of doctor?\n\nYou check your phone which was still in your pocket to see if anyone tried to call you, but nobody has. You thought maybe Peter would have at least tried calling considering you had his car last. If you ever get back home, you can only imagine how pissed he’s going to be when he finds out what happened to it.\n\nYou sit in the bed for a while just wondering what exactly is going on and what you should do next. Honestly, you’re drawing a blank. You had a plan, you tried to follow it and you thought you were succeeding and then it all went to shit yesterday. You’re starting wonder if you’re jinxed.\n\nWhile you could spend your whole time being introspective like you have so many times before, the fact remains that you don’t know where the hell you are and where your “white knight” is. Jack seems like an okay guy, but you really don’t know anything about him except that he’s helped you out quite a bit which would probably make the average person feel grateful, instead it makes you a bit suspicious and this prison like interior isn’t exactly helping.\n\nStill, you don’t seem like you’re being held captive either, so you take the opportunity to get up and leave your room.\n\nWhen you enter the corridor you see several other open entryways leading to more small rooms. Since the left part of the corridor looks like it ends at a solid wall, you go right. You peer into a few of these rooms as you pass by to find that they aren’t really furnished, but rather hold several boxes and containers. Some of them do contain furniture; none of it is arranged in a useable way. In general everything is stacked or positioned to resemble a warehouse more than anything else.\n\nMaybe you are in some sort of warehouse, because so far the color of every walls you’ve seen is gray and they’re concrete along with the floor and ceiling. Lights embedded in the ceiling provide illumination, but this whole place doesn’t seem like a normal house of any kind, which you assumed Jack lived in, you guess not though.\n\nYou pass a set of stairs leading up, so you’re guessing you’re on the ground floor, the way you’re currently heading it looks like a large open room ahead.\n\nAs you approach the large room, you start to hear noise. Sounds like it’s coming from one the rooms ahead and to your right causing you to cautiously approach.\n\nYou peek around the corner and see Jack occupied and messing about with some sort of large radio system along with a few monitors set up. You hear garbled transmissions, but some of it you’re making out sounds military related, something about marshal law.\n\n“Well you don’t need to spy on me, you’re welcome to come in.” Jack says without immediately looking in your direction. Apparently you’re not as stealthy as you thought and Jack is very aware of his surroundings.\n\n“Didn’t mean to spy, just wasn’t sure who or what I’d be possibly bumping into after finding myself in a strange place.” You say standing in the entryway.\n“Understandable. So I trust you’re doing okay?” Jack asks while still messing about with his radio.\n“Yeah, I mean I still ache a bit, but I’m more or less fine. Hey you’re not medically trained are you? Because I thought I’d have some bandages or something what with getting smacked with a brick and glass shattering on the side on my head.”\n“Not professionally, but I used some medical gel on your wounds. Glad to see it worked well.” Jack says finally turning to look at you.\n“Worked well? I’m practically fully healed, is it magical or something?” you joke.\n“No, just highly advanced…um…well if you really need to know, I shouldn’t even have the stuff, but you can acquire a lot of stuff you shouldn’t over the deep web.” Jack says.\n“I see. So I take it, this is where you live?\n“Yeah, more or less now.”\n“Wait, so this is where your mom lived too?”\n“What? Oh no. When I lived with mom, it was a regular house in town. In fact after she died, I still lived there, but when shit started getting hectic in town, I decided I better move somewhere less vulnerable so here I am at this gray building I bought years ago online. As you might have already seen, I got tons of shit stacked in rooms, told you I was a big of a hoarder.”\n“Well it certainly is very gray, must cost a lot to upkeep it.”\n“Not really, place sort of takes care of itself. Just never made a permanent living arrangement out of this place because…well it’s a long story.”\n\nThere’s a bit of a pause in the conversation since Jack just abruptly stops talking and starts twisting knobs and then eventually waves his hands at the radio altogether and the garbled transmissions stop altogether when he turns it off.\n\n“What are you trying to do?” you ask.\n“I’m trying to listen in on a military frequency. Normally I can get clear messages from Fort Timons near Security City, but I’m not having much luck. All I know is marshal law has been declared in major cities across the country. Well that and apparently Ground Zero is still offering their shelters at low low prices. Those ads are fucking everywhere.” Jack replies.\n“Marshall law…that sounds pretty serious.” You remark.\n“Yeah, but I can’t say I’m surprised with the way things have been going in the world lately. Anyway…so what are your plans?” Jack asks.\n“I dunno. I’ve been trying to figure that out myself. I’m not having much luck either.”\n“Well, considering how fucked up things are in town, you’re welcome to stay here. Got plenty of space, food and such.”\n\nIt’s a tempting offer. Really tempting, mainly because you don’t have any idea what you’re going to go, but you exhale and try to gather your thoughts.\n\n“(Sigh) Look, I’m not ungrateful for probably saving my life yesterday. I didn’t mind speaking with you before all that shit went down in the comic shop. Hell, you’re even not bad looking and you’re obviously got your shit together enough that you own your own damn building. I’m also fairly certain you were telling the truth about not being a serial killer.”\n“But?” Jack says predicting your lead in.\n\n“But all of this…well my gut is telling me that something weird is going on with you. I don’t know what exactly, but I imagine it’s complicated. The funny thing is that it probably wouldn’t even necessarily bother me, but you sort of caught me at an unusual point in my life. While I don’t want to bore you with my life story, but I just recently went through an upsetting break up with my first and currently only boyfriend to date a couple days ago and I’m still trying to mentally deal with that along with all the other shit that’s gone on in my life.”\n\nJack continues to listen as you go on.\n\n“You think YOU were a basement dweller? At least you seemed to be doing something productive, my whole life was just coasting by and living off of other people and the most recent one was my ex. I’m fairly certain he would have done anything to take care of me had I complied, but even basement dwellers have their limits I suppose and I just couldn’t make that step. All of which left me up shit’s creek without a boat, let along a paddle. I’m trying to make a real effort of being self-sufficient and I sort of feel like if I stayed here I’d just be falling back into my old routine of sponging off some guy.”\n“You wouldn’t exactly be sponging off me…” Jack starts to say before you interrupt.\n“Jack, I think you better stop right there, if you’re about to imply what I think you’re going to imply. I’m not a damn whore.”\n“What? No! I wasn’t going to suggest that! I just meant I have so much that it’s not like I’d mind if you stuck around. It’s obviously dangerous out there and I’d be quite the asshole if I just threw you out.”\n\nYou just hang your head down at this remark.\n\n“Well that makes you better than my older sister, but it also makes this harder for me, because it would have been easier if you had been looking for some sort of cynical sex exchange like that.”\n“Wait…so you WANT me to treat you like a whore?” Jack asks confused.\n“No! Fuck. I just…shit…I dunno what the hell I want…” you say putting your head in your hands.\n\nAt this point Jack tries to interpret your complete mess of explaining things.\n\n“Okay, I think I know what you’re getting at. You just got out of a relationship and you aren’t really in the mood for another guy to be sniffing around you right now. You also want to be by yourself and try to make it on your own without help since you’ve never been truly independent your whole life. Am I right so far?” Jack asks.\n“Yes.” You reply.\n“And while you aren’t exactly thinking the worst of me right now, you’re still wisely suspicious enough to wonder why the hell I helped you out if I didn’t want something. Obviously there must be something odd about me, for all you know I’ve been stalking you or something.”\n“Well, basically.”\n“Okay, good. Now just let me explain my side of things.”\n\nYou lean again the side of the entryway before Jack goes into his own speech.\n\n“First, yes, I do think you’re attractive and from what I know of you, I WOULD like to get to know you a lot better. I thought maybe there was something there during our nice conversation at the comic shop, but I dunno…I sort of…well let’s just say I’m not exactly great at the whole asking someone out thing, so I lost my nerve and had to gather it again by leaving, and of course that’s when those guys showed up. Not to mention I wasn’t really planning on doing that anyway since I didn’t expect to see anyone other than Jake at the register. Which brings me to the second point, I helped you, for the same reason I helped Jake yesterday, it was the right thing to do. I just wasn’t so lucky with him as I was with you. I’m not saying I’m some hero, but I’ve always liked to believe I’m not a bad guy. So when I saw the opportunity to get you help, I did it. I assure you there was no ulterior motive.”\n\nAt this point Jack fishes something out of his pocket. It’s keys and a wad of money in a roll. He tosses them to you and you catch them.\n\n“Do I want you to stay here because I like you? Yes, of course I would, but I can’t just keep you here, if you don’t want to be. You sound like you have very strong feelings about trying to make it on your own and being by yourself and I understand that. So since your car was trashed, I’m giving you mine. I’m not going to need it much longer…and no that doesn’t mean I’m going to commit suicide. I just won’t be needing it. As for the cash, well you’ll need it more than I will too. You take them both and go live your life and hopefully it will be a good one.”\n\nYou’re pretty speechless. You’ve so rarely had anyone be this cool with you and this doesn’t seem to be a “nice guy” act. If it were, he would’ve been calling you a complete cunt the moment you told him you weren’t interested.\n\n“I dunno what to say except thanks.” You say\n“Don’t mention it. Come on I’ll walk you out.” Jack responds\n\nJack and you leave the radio room and enter the large open room which has a lot of boxes stacked in it’s four corners. On one of the walls is a door, which Jack says, leads to the outside.\n\n“Car is parked right outside, and is in good working condition. Um, just to let you know though we’re several miles east outside of town. It will be quite the drive, but you should get back to town by nightfall. Remember, I want you to know you can come back here if it looks like the town is in just complete anarchy. I…I still worry about your safety. Anyway, just knock three times on the door and I’ll know it is you.”\n“I’ll certainly keep that in mind Jack.”\n“Okay, well…good luck Suzy.” Jack says opening the door, which lets in a blinding brightness.\n\nYou look at Jack and then you suddenly hug him and then kiss him on the cheek. You figure it’s the least you can do. Jack wasn’t expecting it though; he returns the hug until you pull away.\n\nYou and he don’t exchange any more words; you just turn around and leave as the door shuts behind you.\n\nYou get in the car, and count up the money to find that Jack has given you a thousand dollars in hundreds. Not much in the long term, but it would at least sustain you awhile.\n\nYou wonder if you should head back to town or just keep driving east and try to start over somewhere else.\n",
  "page 154": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“Suzy…hey Suzy…get up.” Donna remarks.\n“Huh? What’s going on? What time is it?” you answer half asleep.\n“I dunno, I think it’s getting up for the afternoon. Really I’m sort of surprised you didn’t at least stir a little since you fell asleep last night. You really are a deep sleeper.”\n“Guess yesterday’s cannibal killing and grand theft auto really took it out of me. Hey we’re not moving.” You say looking around and seeing that you’re parked off the side of the road.\n“No, I pulled over to sleep sometime after midnight.”\n“What? That was dangerous! You should’ve woke me up then! I could’ve kept a look out or even taken over with the driving! I mean we could’ve been attacked by who knows what during the night!” you exclaim.\n“We were fine. While I’ve seen a few abandoned vehicles, I haven’t seen a single person driving on this road since we started yesterday. Nobody behind us, and nobody coming from the other direction either.”\n“I don’t care if we were driving in a fucking desolate wasteland, we’ve got cannibals running around, a break down of society and there’s still the potential of angry rednecks coming after us! Next time THINK!”\n“Okay…okay…sorry Suzy.“ Donna says rather meekly.\n\nYou give Donna a dirty look, but tell her to forget it. Actually you’re sort of surprised she didn’t put up more of a fight since it’s not like her to back down from an argument, but maybe she’s becoming a little afraid of you.\n\n“Well, seeing as things are deader than a tomb around here, we might as well take this opportunity to dump our passenger in the back.” You say.\n“Oh, yeah.” Donna replies.\n\nAs you step out of the truck, you look at her to do likewise to help.\n\n“Oh. Wait, you wanted me to help?”\n“That was the idea.”\n“(Sigh) Alright.”\n\nYou and Donna go to the back of the truck and open up the tailgate. The redneck woman’s head that was propped up on it slumps in front of you. Flies have already begun gathering on her face.\n\n“Ugh. She’s already beginning to rot.” Donna says and chokes a bit.\n“She was pretty tall that’s for sure. It is sort of amazing she managed to jump in the truck bed without us realizing it. Maybe it was when you ran over that other girl.” You remark.\n“She fucking attacked us with a hook too. That’s like something out of a horror movie.”\n“Everything about what’s happened to us this week is like something out of a horror movie. I saw Tina with one of those hooks yesterday, I think they were moving bodies with them. Y’know, I never officially met her…but I think this was the infamous Butchie Billie I’d hear about every so often. Anyway, let’s pull her dead ass out.”\n\nGrabbing one arm and Donna grabbing the other, you pull what you believe to be the corpse of Butchie Billie out of the truck. Donna doesn’t have that great of a hold on her and drops her end causing you to nearly fall to the ground too.\n\n“Goddamnit Donna, you can’t…argh. Fuck it. I’ll do it myself!” you say in exasperation.\n\nYou proceed to kick and roll the body further away from the road and into the brush.\n\n“Good enough.” You say breathing a little heavy. “Whew, open up one of my bags, I’m fairly certain I packed a few bottles of water in there.”\n\nDonna gets in the bed of the truck and starts unzipping bags. Eventually she finds the water and passes you one and takes one for herself.\n\nAs you drink, you notice both of your back tires are completely flat. You knew one of them was, but you guess the other one gave up during the night.\n\n“Our tires are fucked. I mean we could still drive on them, but it wouldn’t be a pleasant ride.” You say.\n“Doesn’t matter really, judging by the gauge last night we’re almost out of gas too. Jimmy apparently didn’t keep this truck gassed up in case of an emergency.” Donna says.\n“Great.”\n“I mean I suppose we could just keep driving until we can’t anymore or we possibly find an auto shop.”\n“Auto shop? Out in the sticks?”\n“Well I dunno, don’t they usually have those last chance gas mechanic things along roadsides like this? Besides I think we’re starting to get past the farmland and should be hitting more populated areas soon. Security City is this way after all.” Donna says.\n“Given what happened to our town, that might not be a good thing. We still don’t know what the fuck is going on. All we do know is the government declared martial law and there are rabid people running around.” You say.\n“Well I wasn’t suggesting we go to Security City, I was just saying we should be hitting more populated areas due it being close by. Look, obviously I don’t have a good idea of what to do next, so if you got a long term plan, then by all means let’s follow it.”\n\nBefore you can reply, you hear the sound of vehicle. You peek your head out from behind the truck and see a car heading in your direction. It’s going at a good pace, but MAYBE you can stop it.\n\n“Donna, a car’s coming. Quick, tear your clothing and go out in the road and look like a slutty damsel in distress!” you say.\n“What?!”\n“Just fucking do it!” you say and check to see how many bullets you have.\n\nDonna, gets the picture quickly, though you can tell she’s not entirely happy with this arrangement.\n\nYou hide behind the truck’s side away from the road, while Donna gets in the middle of the road and waves her arms. You can’t believe you’re actually enacting a plan you thought up in your head just yesterday.\n\nYou just hope whoever the driver is; they actually stop and don’t try to do something like say run over Donna instead.\n\nThe car approaches and actually starts to slow down and then eventually stops, but it does so at a distance. Someone then steps out of the passenger side armed with a sub-machine gun.\n\n“Alright honey, if you want to live, I suggest you don’t move.” He says.\n“Don’t shoot! I’m completely unarmed! This isn’t some sort of trick! Please, I just need help, my truck has flat tires and I don’t have any way now to get to Security City!” Donna exclaims.\n“Security City? Hah! You don’t wanna go there trust me. The whole place is fucked! If the military doesn’t round you up and kill ya, the cannibal freaks running all over the place will.” The man shouts.\n\nWell you know that place is definitely off the list now.\n\n“Oh no! I don’t know where to go then! I’m just so lost by myself! Where are you guys going? Can I come with you?” Donna asks.\n“Come with us? Look, I dunno if that’s a good idea. We’re pretty full up with shit and there isn’t much room in this car…”\n“That’s okay, I won’t take up much room. I mean I’ll sit on your lap if I have to.”\n“Sit on my…”\n“Look I’ll do anything you and your friend want! I’ll suck your cocks and fuck you if I have to! Just I can’t be alone! Not after those things tried to kill and eat me yesterday!” Donna screams and starts to rub her eyes and sniffling.\n\nAt this point the man with the sub-machine gun pauses.\n\n“Hold on.” He says and then converses with his driver buddy for a moment. You continue to wait patiently hoping they take this bait.\n\n“Alright honey, you can come with us, but that payment you just offered? Well we’ll be taking it now, so I hope you’re ready to back up your promises.” The passenger shouts and then gets back in the car, which slowly drives up closer to meet Donna.\n\nWhen they drive up near the other side of the truck, you wonder if you should wait a little longer to make sure they’re completely vulnerable or sneak around the truck and open fire now.\n",
  "page 275": "You come to the conclusion that there is literally nothing for you back in your hometown. Given the state it’s in, it doesn’t seem like there is much possibility there either and you’d be better off just trying to make it on your own.\n\nThis is very new territory for you just throwing complete caution to the wind like this, but you’re determined to turn over a new leaf. This is going to be a brand new Suzy and your new life starts right now.\n\nYou start up the car and drive off.\n\nAs you drive you keep trying to form various plans about what you’re going to do when you get to the next town. First thing to do will be to get a room somewhere… or maybe you should just sleep in the car. That would stretch your money out a lot more, but you can’t just do that can you? You’ll need to bathe every once in awhile! Whore baths in a public restroom perhaps?\n\nAs you’re attempting to figure out how you’re going to go about your new life, you start to get a headache just realizing how much hard work this is going to be. You turn the radio on in an effort to keep your mind occupied on something else.\n\n“…remember our shelters are the best in the world. Your family’s survival is important to us, so don’t settle for imitations…”\n\n“Ground Zero ads. Of course.” You say.\n\nYou try to find a station that doesn’t seem to be bought out by this company, but the only luck you have is a few doomsday preacher type stations. Since you’re not really in the mood for that either, you turn the radio off and return to silence.\n\nYou continue to drive for some time. You notice you haven’t even seen another vehicle on the road, which is a little eerie, gets even more so when it starts to get dark.\n\nYou haven’t seen any signs of civilization for quite some time, just rows and rows of trees on either side. You never realized just how rural of an area you’ve lived in before.\n\nEventually the trees thin out a bit and you see a looming structure in the distance on your left.\n\nIt’s a Grey Building.\n\n“What the hell? Did I drive in a circle?” you say to yourself.\n\nYou can’t imagine that you did considering you’ve been pretty much driving in a straight path the entire time. You suppose it MIGHT be possible since your attention hasn’t exactly been completely focused since the drive itself has been so boring, but this seems pretty damn odd.\n\nOdd or not you’re back where you started and you stop your car near the Grey Building pretty frustrated at your situation.\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim and bang on the driver’s wheel.\n\nYou have half a mind to just continue on and go back to town, but you sort of feel like that would be giving up when really this is just a minor set back and you’ve had much worse ones.\n\nJack probably has a GPS, maps or something in that treasure trove of shit he collects and he’ll probably be more than willing to help you out. You just hope he doesn’t see this as a “sign” that you decided to stay after all.\n\nYou park along side the Grey building, get out and make your way towards the door.\n\nRemembering that Jack told you to knock three times, you do so and the door opens up. Jack isn’t there at the door though; maybe he’s got it on an automated system.\n\nThe other thing that seems strange is that it’s pitch black inside. You step just inside the entryway and still can’t see shit. Not even the dim moonlight from the outside is providing any minimal illumination within the doorway.\n\n“Hey Jack! It’s me Suzy! Why are all your lights …Ungh!” you start to call out before you get smashed in the head and fall to the concrete floor.\n\n“DIE INTERLOPER! THIS IS MY GREY BUILDING!” a horrible voice screams before you’re forcibly pulled deeper inside and the door slams shut leaving you in complete darkness.\n\nYou try to get up to run, but a very strong force is keeping you down. You hear the sounds of a rusty chainsaw being started up followed by insane laughter.\n\nIn your last moments before the chainsaw starts ripping your flesh, you realize that you’ve made a terrible mistake.\n\nYou didn’t drive in a circle and this isn’t the GRAY Building.\n\nThis is the GREY Building\n\nYou don’t understand it and you never will, but it doesn’t matter, you’re dead.\n",
  "page 153": "Once again, you can agree that it isn’t the safest place, but you still see no viable alternative of where to go because you’re getting the impression that it’s going to be fucked up no matter where you go.\n\n“Still probably safer than getting on the road right now. I think we need to stay just a little bit longer.” You say.\n“Jesus Christ I can’t believe you’re still willing to stay. (Sigh) Well, at this point I guess I’ve got no choice, but to stay too. I mean I think it’s pretty obvious by now that I can’t go it alone. I’m just not adapting well to this series of events like you seem to be.” Donna remarks.\n“I dunno if I’m adapting or just so overwhelmed by what’s been going on this week that I’m just going with what my instincts are.”\n“Well you’re a far cry from the wallflower you were.” Your sister says.\n“Yeah, I suppose, but I’d actually rather be on my couch in the basement back home.”\n“At this point, I’d rather be on that couch right next to you.” Donna laughs.\n\nYou and Donna leave Jimmy Ray’s trailer and head back to yours. Along the way you bump into Tina who is carrying two big meat hooks.\n\n“So, you and blondie survived, glad to see it, because there are a shitload of bodies that need cleanin’ up.” Tina says.\n\nTina looks at you as if that’s the last thing she wants to be doing.\n\n“Um…” Tina starts to say.\n“Uh, my sister is still really shaken up by the attack, nearly got eaten an’ all you understand. She needs to lie down in the trailer, but I’ll be glad to help.”\n\nTina shakes her head at Donna and turns her attention to you.\n\n“Come on then blondie.” She says and you tell Donna you’ll see her later.\n\nYou follow Tina where there are more than a few dead bodies of those things and two other women are standing by with meat hooks. One of the women is a little bigger and taller than everyone else and has short hair like a buzzcut. The other one is similar to Tina except with curlier hair.\n\n“K, this is Mary Lou an’ the giant over there is Butchie Billie. An’ this one here with me is our newest addition to our wonderful community, blondie.”\n“It’s Suzy, actually.” You say.\n“Yeah, whatever. Let’s start moving these dead fucks before Mel gets back an’ bitches about it. Nevermind, the fact that Mel and the rest of his fuckin’ friends should be here doing this instead of traipsin’ off to town.” Tina says as she digs a meat hook into a body\n“Well they said they were going for medical supplies.” Billie says following suit.\n“Damn fool thing to do really, I told him so too. I told him that right now he should focus on rebuilding the barricades around this place. I mean yeah I know more medical supplies would be useful, but really we got enough to get by for now and for those that got all bit up…well…” Tina trails off, but you know what she’s getting at.\n\n“You…think we should kill them?” Mary Lou asks, shoving her own meat hook in.\n“I didn’t say that. I’m just sayin’ that perhaps wastin’ medicine on them isn’t the best idea because they’re probably goners anyway. I mean don’t you think so? I mean those crazy fuckers biting people had to have been sick with something right? How do we know it isn’t spread through biting or even worse just being close to ‘em? At least Mel had the sense to put all those folks in one trailer though.”\n\nYou’re having a little difficulty putting in your hook. It isn’t like you’ve done this before.\n\n“You need help there blondie? You’re holding us up.” Tina asks.\n“No, I…got it. There.” You say as the hook sinks in.\n“Okay, lift everyone.” Tina says and all four of you do so. Billie’s probably doing the majority of the work though.\n\nAs you carry/drag the body to the open field behind the trailer park, Billie continues the conversation.\n\n“Well I admit, them possibly bein’ infected is a concern for me too, but I’m sort of surprised Mel didn’t shoot them just to be safe, I mean we all know he isn’t excessively compassionate.” Billie remarks.\n\nTina laughs a bit.\n\n“Well that’s true, in fact I almost guarantee if they were anyone else he might’ve just done that, but one of Mel’s few endearing traits is he’s got a sense of loyalty. And I know he feels like he should at least try to help those that watched his back during the recent battle. Not to mention he is drinking buddies with most of ‘em, despite the fact he doesn’t think very highly of ‘em. Oh well, hopefully he’ll be successful with his trip.”\n\nYou almost ask, but then stop yourself. Tina however has already noticed your stifled attempt at continuing the conversation.\n\n“If you got somethin’ to say blondie, say it.” Tina remarks.\n“Well, I was just gonna ask, do you think he’ll even come back?”\n“Shit blondie, that’s a pretty fuckin’ grim ass question. And if I were anyone else I’d probably be pretty upset by the implications, but I’m not worried about Mel. He’ll get back here some how. Everyone else might be dead, but I’m confident he’ll come back.”\n“Hey didn’t Jimmy Ray go with them? I hope he comes back too!” Mary Lou remarks.\n“Heh, guess you’re a little late on the update there Mary, but blondie’s sister Donna currently has her own hooks in Jimmy right now.”\n“What!? That asshole told me how I was the only one for him last week!” Mary Lou exclaims. “Hey blondie, tell your homewreckin’ cunt of a sister to keep her hands off my man!”\n\nYou briefly wonder why Mary Lou who also having blonde hair is calling you blondie. (Granted hers is out of a bottle unlike your natural magnificence)\n\n“Yeah, I’ll pass it on to her.” You remark apathetically.\n\nAt this point you reach your destination where a few other bodies have been placed and the four of you unhook the body and make your way back to the park to presumably get another body.\n\n“Hey, Suzy isn’t it?” Billie suddenly pipes up.\n“Yeah?” you ask turning your head a bit to look at Billie who is walking behind you.\n“Do you have an older sister by the name of Kelly who participates in the fight clubs in town?”\n“Yes, I do. How did you know?” you ask.\n“Because in the locker room she used to constantly bitch about having a pretty blonde sister by the name of Suzy that didn’t do shit around the house and another one by the name of Donna that was a complete whore. I took a shot in the dark that you and this Donna were the same ones that might be related to her.”\n“Oh. Well you got it right. Wow, didn’t realize she complained about us at…her work.”\n“Eh, she mostly complained about you. I mean ALL the fuckin’ time. Most of us were sick to death of hearing her bitch. So where is Kelly anyway?”\n“Dunno. Don’t really care either. Knowing her she’s probably surviving this bullshit somehow though. Were you and her an item or something?” you ask.\n“Fuck no! I hated that cunt. That bitch knocked out three of my teeth in our last match! I almost had her, but I know that cunt spiked my drink with something before the match! Anyway she was straight, but I figured you knew that.”\n“Hm, sort of surprising. Just figured she was a lesbian. My whole family did actually.” You say.\n“Nah, she tried to get with so many of the guys at the fight club it was actually kind of pathetic. She actually would’ve been a whore like your sister Donna had she actually been successful. As it stands she was more like a rapist since she’d routinely intimidate some of the scrawny audience members into having sex with her.”\n\nThis revelation about Kelly is pretty interesting, but you don’t think you need to know too much more.\n\n“Yikes, is all I got to say about that.” You remark.\n“Yeah, but I will say this, her physical description of you doesn’t do you justice. You’re much prettier.” Billie says and them smiles with a couple of missing teeth.\n\nYou turn your head back away and close your eyes in horror at such a thought. Tina glances over at you and smirks.\n\n“Kinda disturbin’ to think she’s been starin at yer ass this whole time isn’t it blondie?” Tina says.\n“Now that’s not true, I’ve been starin’ at yours as well.” Billie laughs.\n“Pfft, honey, EVERYONE stares at my fuckin’ ass.” Tina says puffing up slightly in pride.\n\nWhen you get back to the trailer park, Mel and the rest have already returned. In the distance you see him slamming his truck door and hear him swearing.\n\n“I guess it didn’t go well. (Sigh) Let me go see what happened. As for the rest of these bodies, you can keep moving them if y’all want, but as far as I’m concerned Mel and whoever survived their trip can do it instead. I’m done with this mess.”\n\nAt this point Tina leaves and seeing as you don’t particularly want to move any more bodies you head back to your trailer. Eventually you arrive and collapse on your sofa.\n\n“Suzy?” Donna asks coming from out of her room.\n“Yeah, it’s me. Man, I’m tired. I think the stress of the day is really catching up to me. Oh Mel’s back, guess it didn’t go as planned if he’s back already.”\n“Is Jimmy Ray with him?”\n“Dunno, I just saw Mel getting out of his truck and cussing up a storm.”\n“I guess I’ll go check. Hope so…”\n“Wait a minute, weren’t you just ready to rob the guy blind a moment ago?” you ask.\n“Well that was a different situation. I mean if we’re going to stay here, it’s best I latch on to the best looking guy here right? Isn’t that what you said?”\n“Actually I said becoming self-sufficient, but I suppose grabbing one of the guys so you’re only sleeping with one as opposed to several works too. Well good luck. Oh there’s a girl with a bad bleached blonde job by the name of Mary Lou that’s got her eyes on him, so you might have some competition.”\n“Pfft. They haven’t made anyone that can compete with me. Let alone around here. I mean come on, it’s not even a contest.” Donna remarks.\n“Well glad to see your confidence still remains strong in all this. Have fun and be careful. I’m going to get some rest.”\n\nAnd with that you leave Donna to her own devices and turn over on your side to get some sleep. As you drift off you figure you’ll only get a few hours before someone wakes you up to do something, but as it turns out, you sleep through the entire night.\n",
  "page 274": "Maybe if he’d given you ten or even five thousand you’d feel more comfortable making the risk of “starting over” but with just a thousand, you’re not that confident even with your new found self sufficient approach to life.\n\nBesides, you’re not even sure where the hell eastward even takes you. For all you know it ends in wilderness, you’ve never been out of your own town before. Better to take your chances with the devil you know.\n\nAs you drive down the empty road, you pass long stretches of trees and wilderness. You never realized until just now how rural in an area you lived in before.\n\nYou briefly check your phone again to see if anyone has called, but as usual nobody has. Nobody cares.\n\nYou continue driving thinking about probably having to deal with the near state of anarchy the town is in. Assuming you even get home in one piece you’ll have to deal with Peter and his car. You figure you’ll have to at least give him this one.\n\nAll of which isn’t going to help you with Kelly who is still intent on throwing you out by the end of the week. Chances are if you attempted to “pay rent” with some of your money she’d just punch you in the face and take ALL of your money and let you stay another month at best which means being on a time limit and scrambling for a job again. You got very lucky once with the job situation as fast as you did, and you don’t think you’ll manage it that quickly again even if the town wasn’t all fucked up.\n\nThat leaves your plan “B” choice of living with your sister Donna and your so called best friend Julie which isn’t much of a plan at all so much as it’s just a free living arrangement. What a joy that’s going to be, dealing with their partying every night. You might as well be living out in the chaos filled streets given how they carry on. Hell, you might even be safer. You’ll definitely have to make sure to keep your newly acquired loot well hidden.\n\nYou try to take you mind off of all this by turning on the radio…Ground Zero ads.\n\n“Ground Zero…how fucking original.” You say and turn the radio off, shaking your head.\n\nYou continue driving and driving and driving; your thoughts continuing to go back and forth about why you’re even going back to town.\n\nIt really would be so much easier to just stay with Jack.\n",
  "page 134": "While you haven’t quite ruled out the possibility of living with Donna, you don’t think you’re quite ready to go driving over there yourself and putting up with some old guy perving on you today. If you do decide to go over there, you’ll do it later tonight.\n\nBesides, you want to see just how bad it might be over at Julie’s before making a decision.\n\nA few minutes of driving to your destination and you’re sure of one thing being pretty bad, the roads! Once again there are cops everywhere, but also ambulances and fire trucks racing to their various destinations too. You nearly turn around and head back home, but eventually you make it to Julie’s neighborhood, which is thankfully not in the midst of anarchy.\n\nYou pull up to the driveway and get out of the car. You figure you’ll assess the situation before making a decision of whether you’re going to stay or not.\n\nYou sort of expected to see a few people drinking on the porch or at least hearing loud music as you walk up to the door, but so far it doesn’t sound like any sort of party going on or at least not an overly rowdy one, which is odd considering how people have been acting in this town for the past few days.\n\nYou knock on the door, but get no immediate answer. After a few more bangs you finally get an answer, but it isn’t Julie.\n\n“Hello.” A man says in a flat tone and almost seems to be studying you. He looks like he might be around your age, but he doesn’t look like the sort that would be at one of Julie’s parties. He’s very “ordinary” looking.\n“Hey. Where’s Julie at?” you ask.\n“Julie? Oh yes, the owner of this house. Well, I don’t really know. I remember seeing her yesterday, but then she left with some guy and I haven’t seen her since. Of course this being her house she has to return sometime right? Would you like to wait?” the man asks opening the door further to invite you in.\n\nSomething about this guy feels a little “off” to you.\n\n“Wait, who are you?” you ask.\n“Oh I’m sorry for not introducing myself. I’m Johnny. I was at Julie’s party yesterday. Guess you could say I got a little tipsy and decided I shouldn’t go home in that condition, so I flopped out in the basement. I’m not the only person who did that apparently considering some of Julie’s other guests are still here as well.”\n\nYou peer inside and see that Johnny is indeed speaking the truth. A couple of people are on the couch playing some sort of video game.\n\n“So now that you know who I am, I have to ask who you are.” Johnny says.\n“I’m Suzy and I’m Julie’s friend.” You say.\n“I see, well come on in, I’m sure when Julie gets back she’ll be pleased to see you.”\n\nYou enter the house and the place is in a lot better condition than you would’ve thought for a party house. Johnny quickly closes the door and locks it. Causing you to immediately look back.\n\n“You never can tell what weirdo will show up with unlocked doors and all, right?” he says.\n“Indeed.” You say still getting an uneasy feeling about this guy.\n“So, you’re one of Julie’s friends. Guess you’re a real party girl, just like she is huh?” Johnny remarks almost in an accusing fashion.\n“Hardly. Are these all the people in the house?” you ask, pointing to the stoners playing video games and completely ignoring you and Johnny.\n“Yeah, I mean there were some other people here earlier, but these lot are all that’s left, beside myself. Julie’s pretty cool about letting people just crash here even if she’s not around.”\n\nWith Johnny creepily hovering near you and the stoners babbling about inane shit, you already realize that this is not going to work for you.\n\n“Alright, everyone get out.” You say, but the only one who even hears you is Johnny.\n“What?” Johnny asks.\n“Look I hate to be rude, and you probably didn’t know this, but I’m moving in here. Now when Julie is here, she can have all her little drug addled party friends over as much as she likes, I mean its her house after all. But I’m not going to put up with them while she isn’t here! So I want everyone out, you all can come back later when she’s here. Whenever that is.”\n\nJohnny’s still the only one who is even paying attention and his facial expression on your stance hasn’t changed.\n\n“But if it’s Julie’s house doesn’t she have final say in what goes?” Johnny asks.\n“Yeah, well when I see Julie, I’m going to have a little discussion with her about our new living arrangements.” You remark.\n\nOnce again Johnny just stares at you, it almost feels like he’s staring through you. It makes you uncomfortable to say the least.\n\n“All right. You’ve got a point. I wouldn’t want a bunch of strangers just wandering around in my home either. I’ll get out of your hair, as for these guys, I can get ‘em to go.” Johnny says and then suddenly shouts at the stoners that everyone has to get out of the house and starts ripping controllers out of their hands.\n\n“Hey!”\n“Not cool dude!”\n“You dick!”\n“Sorry guys, but as the old saying goes, you don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here. Come on, let’s move it.” Johnny says and eventually the stoners grudgingly shuffle off to leave. Johnny follows behind them.\n\n“When you see Julie, tell her it was an excellent party last night.” Johnny says and flashes a brief smile, which comes off more creepy than friendly. You don’t even reply, you just shut the door and lock it, glad to be rid of everyone.\n\nRemembering that your sister said that if you did live here, you’d be sleeping in Julie’s dad’s old office. You explore that room first. When you get there it looks pretty much like the same office you remember being in a few times when you played over here. It’s definitely convenient that it has a small private bathroom leading from it as well as a couch that apparently folds out into a bed.\n\nAfter assessing your possible new digs, you decide to go retrieve your bags from the car. You unpack your bags and haul them into the house and head on into your new room.\n\nAfter getting a little bit settled, you figure since you’re all alone in the house, you might as well do something that usually puts you in a better mood. (and you sure could use it)\n\nWhile you’re in the middle of it, you suddenly think you hear something. You call out thinking that maybe Julie is finally home, but when you get no reply, you just check to make sure the door to your room is locked. If Julie does come home, you don’t want her suddenly walking in on you.\n\nAfter getting back in the mood and taking care of your needs you wash up a bit and return to your usual routine of…well doing nothing at all.\n\nHours pass and eventually you start to get hungry so you head to the kitchen in the hopes of finding food. You manage to find a few bags of junk food and some unopened drink in the fridge. Once again while you’re doing this, you swear you think you hear noise. You call out again to see if anyone is here, but there is no answer.\n\nGiven that it’s now nighttime you’re a little on edge. You know its probably just the house making creaking sounds, but with all the bullshit that’s been going on out in the streets lately you’re just a little paranoid.\n\nJust as you’re heading back to your room, the front door suddenly opens! It’s Donna and some other young woman who looks a bit on the trashy side.\n\n“Shit! You scared me.” You say.\n“Why didn’t you pick up your phone? I tried calling you before I got over here.” Donna asks.\n“I…I guess I had it on vibrate and didn’t hear it.” You say.\n“Hm. Well I see this place is practically a tomb. I take it Julie isn’t home?”\n“Nope, I haven’t heard from her either.”\n“That’s really odd…”\n\nSuddenly the trashy young woman speaks up.\n\n“Hey Donna are we picking your shit up or what? You know how fucked up it is out there right now and I’d like to get home before it gets worse.”\n“Oh yeah, better get to it. Suzy, this is my friend Tina.” Donna says and heads upstairs.\n\n“Hello.” You say to Tina, but she just grunts at you and heads back outside to her car.\n\nRemembering that Donna wanted you to help her move some of the stuff, you head upstairs to her room.\n\n“Your friend Tina isn’t very friendly.” You ask.\n“Yeah, well if you were a horny guy with a hundred dollar bill, she’d be really friendly towards you. Anyway, she’s always been cool with me ever since I’ve known her, plus she helped me get the current job I have.” Donna says as she packs away items.\n“You need anything for me to carry down?”\n“Yeah, but not yet. Really I’m thinking I’ll get most of this stuff later when I have a day off. Right now I just want to get the hell out of this town, it’s getting nuts out there!”\n“Yeah, it was pretty chaotic out there earlier on my drive here. So how was your first day?”\n“Not bad. As strange as it may seem, it actually was calmer in the club than it was outside. Though having bouncers helps in that area I suppose. Still a couple of fights did break out.”\n“Shit. You okay? Are you sure the job is safe?”\n“Oh I’m safe. Like I said, there’s good protection there. Honestly I’m more concerned with the drive TO the club, but I imagine whatever is going on will die down eventually.”\n“Hope so.”\n\nDonna finishes packing a bag and starts to pack a new one and you stand there silent until you hear a noise from downstairs causing you to jump a bit.\n\n“Are you okay?” Donna asks.\n“Yeah, what the hell’s that noise?” you ask, briefly stepping out of Donna’s room to look over into the living room.\n“Probably Tina.”\n“No, she’s not down there and besides she went back to wait in the car.”\n“Well maybe she wandered back in briefly…you seem a little stressed.”\n“I dunno. The shit’s that’s been going on in town and I guess being alone in the house at night has got me a little jumpy. Sort of concerned that Julie hasn’t come back either.”\n“Mmm, well that IS odd. I tried calling her again earlier too with no luck. Have you thought anymore about coming to live with me? I told you it would be fine and I know you think the trailer park isn’t safe environment, is this town really any safer right now?”\n",
  "page 255": "You might be reverting back to old habits, but if there is some hectic bullshit going on out there, then you want to avoid it. They can handle it and you decide to be extra cautious and block the door with a chair.\n\nYou hear the sounds of gunfire above you. That isn’t what bothers you so much as it’s the growling and yelling that sounds like it’s coming from nearby. You remember that there are other “patients” on this same floor.\n\nMore time passes and you still hear gunshots and the inhuman noises. You are starting to worry that it’s quite possible this house is going to be overrun by these things, and you haven’t even seen one. This fear becomes even more intense when you stop hearing the gunshots and only hear the guttural noises nearby. You start to feel like you’ve made another bad choice.\n\nSuddenly there’s an attempt to open the door only to be stopped by the chair you’ve propped against it. This is followed by a loud bang on the door, which scares the hell out of you.\n\n“Suzy! What the hell? Is this door barricaded?” you hear Lilith’s voice shout.\n“Yeah…is it safe?” you ask.\n“It’s safe in that we’re not in any immediate danger, but we gotta start getting the hell outta here. Open up!”\n\nWasting no time you move the chair and the door opens up. Lilith throws your clothes at you and you can hear those awful noises in the corridor. Yelling and banging.\n\n“Here. Get dressed and don’t worry about the noises, the other subjects aren’t getting out of those rooms anytime soon.” Lilith says.\n\nYou’re not as sure as Lilith is about that, so you just get dressed as fast as you can and exit the room with her.\n\n“So what’s going on?” you ask as you follow her.\n“What’s going on is Leslie and I are heading to that GZ Shelter after he and I gather a few things. The crazies from town are spilling out from it and we don’t want to be here in case another wave comes. I was hoping to have more time to pack, but I guess we can’t have everything.”\n\nYou and Lilith get to the ground floor and finally see the house proper. It’s a bit of a mess now probably due to all the running around and shooting, but obviously was nice at one time. Then you enter the front room and see several broken windows, and couple of dead bodies. One of them is a uniformed man with his throat ripped out and several slashes across his face.\n\nNearby him is a body of a disheveled looking woman with several bullet holes in her body and head. She still has a chunk of flesh in her teeth and even in death her eyes display a crazed look. It sort of freaks you out.\n\n“Um, that guy in the uniform, shouldn’t someone shoot him in the head?”\n“What? No. These aren’t zombies. They’re just well…rabid.” Lilith chuckles. “Headshots aren’t even necessary to kill them, though it sure as hell helps.”\n\nA couple more uniformed men with the Ground Zero insignia on them walk into the room holding rifles.\n\n“Place seems to be all secure Dr. Morningstar. No other hostiles in the house or around the house.” One of them says.\n“Good. Glad not all of you were incompetent. Wait, are you two the only ones left?”\n“Afraid so doctor.” One of them remarks.\n“Oh well. Okay, I want you two to stand guard out front. Make sure there isn’t another horde or whatever coming our way and if there is, run back in here and tell me immediately.”\n\nThe two uniformed men nod and leave out the front door which is now half hanging off the hinges. You and Lilith both take a quick look outside and see the bodies of several crazies as well as GZ security. In the driveway you see that Lilith’s truck is heavily shot up and a couple bodies of crazed townies lie next to it.\n\n“Great, these assholes never learned the concept of one shot one kill. (Sigh) Guess we’re all just piling into the Ground Zero van.” Lilith says shaking her head.\n\nLilith continues looks around a bit more at her partially destroyed house.\n\n“Well at least nobody has to clean this up this time. I remember the many many times I’d come home from work and I’d find Leslie had left a damn mess all over the house, much worse than this sometimes even. A lot more bodies too. Still remember the disorder he left when he was trying to write a poem for me on one of our past anniversaries. But it was such a lovely and thoughtful sentiment so I wasn’t too mad…anyway have you made your decision of what you’re going to do yet?” Lilith asks.\n\nYou still really aren’t sure and lacking an answer, you ask a question.\n\n“What would I do at the shelter again?\n“Well I told you, I’m not in charge of assignments, but I’m sure there would be some sort of position there for you. Ground Zero doesn’t waste resources.”\n“I see.”\n\nLilith looks at you with a squint.\n\n“You…still don’t trust me do you? Don’t answer. I know you don’t. (Sigh) I suppose I don’t blame you. Look, if you don’t want to go with us you don’t have to, I meant that. Still, I think it would be foolish if you didn’t.”\n“It might be equally foolish if I went with you. Who knows what the hell is in store for me in an underground shelter.” You say.\n“True, but think on this. If I really had anything bad in store for you there, don’t you think I would’ve just had security and my brother restrain you and take you there against your will anyway? I’m giving you a choice. You can go with us, or not. One of your problems Suzy is you don’t take chances, you stick with what you think is safe and look where that has gotten you. But if safety is your main concern, I’m just going to say that staying here isn’t exactly the safe option. This house isn’t secure, you’ll have a few days of food and water at best and if the crazed townsfolk don’t come ripping this place apart again, there are always just the plain opportunists that are no doubt lurking about as well. You don’t even have a vehicle to leave this place. Mine got all shot up and we’re taking the other one. Do you even have a plan if you stay here?”\n\nYou don’t…as usual.\n\n“No.” you reply.\n“Well I’d think your choice would be simple then. Anyway, I have to bags to pack and when I’m done, I’m going to need to know what your answer is Suzy.” Lilith remarks and leaves you by yourself.\n\nYou walk around the ground floor of the house a bit, just looking around. You start to form various thoughts in your head about how this place could be made more defensible. You just aren’t sure if you’re up to the task though.\n\nYou briefly consider the idea of somehow overpowering one of those GZ security guys outside and driving off with the truck yourself, but you aren’t confident that you’d be successful. You then wonder if you could successfully flirt with one of them…\n\nYou head outside and speak with both of the guards while attempting to be as charming as you can. You even manage to muster up the fortitude to blatantly make sexual innuendo and such.\n\nIt doesn’t work. One of them is gay and the other is happily married and even if that wasn’t the case, they get irritated at the fact that you’re distracting them from their duty and start telling you to go away. You realize your plan isn’t going to work and you give up.\n\n“Christ Suzy, some seductress you are.” You mutter to yourself.\n\nThis brings you back to your original two choices and both of those have the potential to go to shit for various reasons, but it’s all you got.\n",
  "page 133": "TUESDAY\n\n\n“…if you act now you’ll get a free…”\n\nYou groggily grab the remote to shut off the incessant noise of the Ground Zero commercial on the TV screen.\n\nYou grab your phone to check the time and see that once again you’ve slept through the morning as usual. You also see that Bobby tried to call you, but you’re still not in the mood to call him back. Though if you don’t secure a place to live you might not have a choice. Still as far as you know the offer to live at Julie’s is still good, you’re just not sure about how well that’s going to go over now.\n\nWhile you’re trying to ponder your next move, you get a call. It’s Donna again. Might as well get this over with.\n\n“Donna, this better be good, because you’re not exactly my favorite person right now.” You say answering the phone.\n“Whoa! Hold on Suzy! Don’t hang up!” Donna exclaims.\n“Say what you got to say.”\n“Okay, look first of all I’m sorry about what you had to go through. I know that had to suck for you. I shouldn’t have convinced you to run anyway. It’s obvious now that was a stupid plan in the first place since I didn’t even have anything in the car. (Sigh) Last night when I was sleeping on a beer soaked couch in a trailer hiding out from the cops I sort of had a revelation of how my choices in life had lead me to that point. I also sort of realized that if I probably continue on this path it’s only going to get worse.”\n\nThat’s rather philosophical of your sister, and it’s enough to keep your attention.\n\n“So I’ve decided that I need to do something with my life and make it better, so I got a job.” Donna says.\n“A job? How the hell did you get a job so quick? Doing what?” you ask.\n“I’m going to be a stripper at Kitty City! The owner was offering me a job yesterday and I already was getting tips from guys who mistook me for one of the strippers here anyway. So I figured why not? In fact I’m on break right now.”\n\nWhy are you not surprised?\n\nDonna continues before you can even speak again.\n\n“Now before you judge, starting a new life takes money and let’s face it, I don’t have exactly many useful skills that are going to earn me a lot of cash in a quick amount of time. I figure I can earn enough to save and figure things out as I go.”\n“Hm, well that’s great and all, but why are you telling me all this?” you ask.\n“Because this is my new start and like I said I feel bad about convincing you to go along with my plan yesterday. Besides, don’t you still need a place to stay? You can come live with me!”\n“I thought I was already going to do that by moving in to Julie’s.”\n“Nah, I’m not going back to Julie’s. Too much temptation to go back to my old ways there. I’m moving into one of the trailers at the trailer park.”\n“Wait. You just started working as a stripper. How the hell did you manage to get a trailer already?”\n“I secured one after…um talking with the park owner this morning. Look, that’s not really important right now. What is important is I got a deal on a fairly good one and it’s big enough for two of us. It might be a little rough going at first, but I anticipate after a few weeks of teasing these degenerates here, we’ll be living fairly comfortably, if not in the lap of luxury.”\n“I dunno. While I’m still pissed about yesterday, it does mean a lot that you’re making this pretty generous offer. I don’t know about living in a trailer park though. I mean aren’t you worried about the kind of people there? In fact I can imagine a lot of the type that Kelly associates with come from there, do you really think its safe?”\n“Safe as opposed to what? Growing up in our household? We had a fucking paranoid psychotic older brother, a sadistic bullying older sister and at one point a goddamn SERIAL KILLER uncle living in our house. At least the hostile rednecks around here won’t be living under our roof! Besides, it really isn’t as bad as you hear.”\n\nYou find that a little hard to believe considering you’ve heard more than enough stories about the trailer park outside of town. Donna might not think its bad, just because she was living there overnight.\n\n“I just don’t know Donna. I mean I wasn’t exactly looking forward to dealing with the non-stop partying at Julie’s, but I’d at least feel a little safer there than I would at the trailer park.”\n“Huh, don’t be so sure of that. Julie pretty much has gotten to the point where she has an open door policy to let any creepy weirdo that walks in off the street in the house. It’s actually amazing someone like Uncle Ed hasn’t come in and killed us all. Are you heading over there sometime today?”\n“Well if I can secure a ride over there I will.”\n“Okay, well if you do get over there could you let Julie know that I’m moving out? She’s still not answering her phone. I’m going to have to make arrangements to get my bigger things, but maybe you could help me get some of my smaller items when I get over there tonight?”\n“Well, I suppose I could.” You say.\n“Great. I knew I could count on your Suzy. (Sigh) You really are the good one in the family sis. It’s so unfair that life hasn’t been better to you. Once again I’m really sorry about what happened yesterday. It’s nearly time for me to go out there and shake my ass again so I gotta go. Just…think about what I said okay? If you change your mind about your future living arrangements just come with Tina and me when we go over to Julie’s tonight, or I guess if you’re really feeling adventurous you could always go over to the trailer park yourself. Just go to the owner’s trailer with the big signs around it and mention my name and he’ll let you in my new place. He’s sort of letch, but he’s old so he mostly confines it staring and making the occasional comment. Don’t worry about it.”\n\nAfter another sincere apology about yesterday, Donna finally hangs up leaving you now with a new option.\n\nDonna seems to be genuinely trying to change her life in her own way. You almost can’t believe it was Donna on the phone at all. Maybe some sort of pod person replaced her.\n\nShe also seems to be really making an effort to make things up to you, which is surprising as well. It’s always a rarity in your family when you actually try to help each other out.\n\nStill, you’re not sure about this whole living in a trailer park business for several reasons, but you suppose you could give it a little thought at least. In any case, you need to get a ride to wherever it is you’re going to be heading to and that means seeing if your brother Peter is going to be just as accommodating as your sister currently is.\n\nYou head upstairs and knock on the door to the garage.\n\n“Hey, um Peter? You busy?”\n\nYou don’t get an answer right away, but eventually you do after more knocking.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, hold on!” Peter says before answering the door. He’s only peaking his head out, so it’s very likely he’s naked.\n\n“Um, sorry to interrupt whatever it is you’re doing, but I need a ride to my new place.”\n“I thought you moved out yesterday.”\n“Yeah, there was a slight hiccup in the plan yesterday. Anyway, can you give me a ride over to my new place?”\n“(Sigh) I’m kinda in the middle of recording something. I’m assuming you’re going to Julie’s?”\n“Yeah…I think.” You say.\n“You think? You don’t know if you’re going to live over at Julie’s place or not?”\n“Well…Donna got a new place of her own and I’m still not sure if I should just move in with her yet.”\n“Donna got a new…look you know what? I don’t give a shit about any of this.” Peter says and then closes the door.\n\nYou think that’s the end of it, but he opens it up again, but this time only his hand with some keys in it are coming out.\n\n“I’m not your personal taxi service. Here, take my car and return it tomorrow or at least by Thursday. Now don’t disturb me again!”\n\nYou take the keys and Peter slams the door. This is probably the most helpful he’s been in…well ever.\n\nYou go back and repack some of your bags and drag them to Peter’s car. After loading everything up in the backseat you pull out of the drive way and wonder which way you should go.\n",
  "page 254": "You’re not staying in here like a sitting duck. If whatever the things are that are attacking the house succeed in overrunning the place, you’d be trapped. Better you at least get to an area where you can run somewhere else, and with any luck you’ll be able to escape this place altogether.\n\nYou exit the room and quickly run down a corridor where you hope you’ll some stairs in that direction, because with as noisy as the other patients are, you have just as much fear that one of them is going to get out their locked rooms and attack you despite the fact Lilith says they’re secure.\n\nYou soon find the stairs leading up and the sounds of gunfire and shouts get even louder. You hear a lot of glass breaking as well.\n\nAll the action seems like it’s going on in the front part of the house, so that’s where you head away from and soon find yourself in the kitchen.\n\nFrom the kitchen you can see a door leading to backyard. Looking out the window, it doesn’t appear that any of those crazy people are attacking from this direction so that’s one good thing. It also looks like the fence would be very hard to climb since it’s a smooth high wooden fence. If you were planning to escape, your chances of doing it this way have decreased.\n\nStill, you also notice the tree in the yard with branches that hang over the fence. You probably could climb it and drop down if you really wanted to get away. Of course with all those things out there, that might not be the safest plan, even if they aren’t coming from this direction. You also feel a little vulnerable what with just wearing a hospital gown.\n\nThen you hear the chaos going on within the house and the sounds of what you think to be those things finally getting into this place.\n\nWasting no more time, you look around for a weapon and a nasty looking machete catches your eye. You have no idea what one of these would be doing in the kitchen, but you’re taking it and getting the hell out of here.\n\nAs you’re opening up the door you hearing the sounds of battle getting more hectic, in fact it even sounds like it’s getting closer to your location…\n\n“I’m gonna check around back to make sure none of them are…HOLY SHIT!” A uniformed man with a GZ logo on it exclaims when you turn to face him.\n\nHaving no idea who you are, seeing you hold a machete in your hand, the fact that you just opened the backdoor and him being totally surprised by your presence causes him to do the only logical thing a man in his position would do.\n\nHe thinks you’re a hostile and immediately opens fire on you with his rifle. You don’t have time to do anything except fatally catch bullets at that point.\n\nWhen the chaos dies down, Lilith is annoyed about losing you as her control subject, but she gets over it.\n",
  "page 257": "It does seem very likely that if Lilith were going to do something to you, she would’ve done it already. Plus you haven’t given her any trouble like she wanted, so that’s has to be in your favor.\n\nAlso, she makes some very good points about staying here. Civilization as you know it seems to be failing hard and you aren’t exactly the “survivalist” type to deal with it. Seems like it would be too late to start learning how in the final hour too, even if you had the desire.\n\nWhile you aren’t exactly sure how life would be in an underground shelter, you can’t help think that you’d be more “at home” there. After all it’s just an oversized basement right?\n\nIt’s a risk, but it’s one you feel more confident about mainly because it requires little effort on your part. You sit on one of the few non-broken chairs and wait for Lilith.\n\nA few moments pass and you hear footsteps coming up from the basement accompanied by some swearing and more footsteps in one of the other rooms.\n\n“Where the fuck did I put that fucking thing? Shit, better not have lost…oh good here it is.” You hear Leslie say before he soon enters the front room where you’re waiting for Lilith.\n\nLeslie carries two sizable black bags and a machete when he enters the room. He stares at you for a moment, which makes you a bit uncomfortable.\n\n“Is my sister still upstairs?” he asks, but it’s more like an order due to his tone.\n“Yeah.” You answer.\n“Typical. She’s the one dragging me to this fucking shelter and I’m ready before she is. I swear I don’t want to go to this fucking place. Let alone working there. The idea of becoming part of a corporate fucking machine is just a fucking anathema to me. Probably have some little shit bean counter for a boss telling me he wants something done at a certain time. I fucking hate shit like that. I fucking hate it. I don’t like being told what to do, when to do it, or ANYTHING!”\n\nAt this point Leslie begins shaking his machete in a violent manner and you see his eyes briefly roll into the back of his head like he’s going to go into a convulsion.\n\nThen all of a sudden his eyes snap back and he addresses you again.\n\n“But the things we do for love right?” Leslie says.\n“I guess so.”\n“Mm. Speaking of love, my sister has told me a bit about you and it’s too bad you and my nephew didn’t work out. Guess he’ll be stuck with his shrew of a sister now. If he’s smart, he’d ditch her and go for his other one…can’t remember her fucking name…really quiet…”\n“Helen?” you answer.\n“Yeah, that’s her. You sort of remind me of her a bit. You’re prettier of course, but same sort of wallflower personality. You get molested as a child? Daddy ever make you suck his dick when Mommy wasn’t around? Something like that?”\n“No!” you say not expecting such a question.\n“Hm, interesting. Would’ve thought you had been, especially since I heard your family was a bit on the dysfunctional side.”\n“Well they weren’t THAT dysfunctional.”\n\nLeslie gives you a look of annoyance, which makes you a little tense, well more tense than when he was waving his machete around earlier.\n\n“Oh. I see. That was a shot at MY family right?” Leslie exclaims.\n“I didn’t…” you start to say.\n“No, YOU know what you meant and so did I! Is that why you didn’t stay with my nephew? Felt you were too good for him?”\n“That’s not the reason, I…”\n“Pfft, I don’t want to fucking hear it! Here I am trying to make the effort to have friendly fucking conversation with you and you’re fucking insulting me! Well fuck you too bitch!” Leslie says and when you see him starting to walk in your direction you begin to get worried, but instead he storms out the front door.\n\nJust as you’re recovering from that incident of Morningstar insanity, Lilith comes walking down from upstairs carrying a couple bags.\n\n“What’s going on down here? I heard my brother ranting as usual. Everything okay?” she asks.\n“I dunno. He started talking to me and I tried to be friendly, but he took what I said out of context and got really pissed at me.”\n“Oh. Yeah, been there before. My brother’s not very good at social interaction unless that other person also happens to be an asshole. Nevermind him, you’re fine. Anyway, did you make your decision? Are you going with us?”\n“Well…I was, but now I’m not sure…”\n“What? Is it my brother? I told you forget about him. The shelter is a big place! Chances are you’re never going to have to interact with him again when we get there.”\n\nLilith puts her bags down and walks over in an attempt to reassure you.\n\n“Come on, you don’t really want to stay here do you? Dangerous cannibals and criminal types, scavenging for sustenance, no proper toilets, I assure you Suzy at the GZ shelter you won’t have to worry about any of that shit.”\n“Well, okay.” You say.\n“Great, ah damnit!” Lilith suddenly remarks and puts her hand on her lower back.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“I dunno. It’s my back. Shit. I think all that damn running around, shooting, lifting and carrying heavy things took its toll. I really need to start exercising on a regular basis. Damn. (Sigh) I hate to ask, but could you carry my bags outside, you can just hand them to those two guards if you want.”\n“Oh, sure okay.” You say.\n\nYou pick up the bags and head out the door with Lilith slowly walking behind.\n\nYou approach the two guards who are still standing on the porch and just as you’re holding the bags out for them to take, you feel a sharp needle going into the side of your upper arm.\n\nYou drop the bags and turn around in horror, clutching your arm. Lilith once again holds a needle in her hand and you’re soon feeling the affects.\n\n“Sorry Suzy, but this was the ONLY way GZ was going to let me take you. I never lied though; you will be given a position to contribute to the community. You’ll continue to be a test subject…though I’m afraid it will involve a little more than just questions and some blood tests this time.”\n“You…you…” is all you manage to utter before you collapse on the ground and unconsciousness begins to take affect.\n\nYou can still hear some of the conversation as you start to pass out.\n\n“Carry her to the truck and Leslie, you can carry my bags since your short temper nearly cost GZ a perfectly good subject.”\n“Dunno why you just didn’t take that bitch to begin with.” Leslie remarks.\n“Because I wanted to see if she’d ultimately go with what was easy or actually grow as a person and make the harder decision. She failed which is why she might as well be put in a GZ experiment lab. She’s obviously not a learning animal, better her life goes towards something more useful.”\n\nYou’re out for the remainder of the day, in fact you’re out of it for quite a few days. By the time you wake up you’re strapped to a surgical table with metal restraints with a lot medical equipment in the room. A bright light shines overhead.\n\nFear overwhelms every fiber of your being. You being to call out for help, but the group of masked doctors in a circle nearby don’t look like they’re going to be doing that.\n\n“The subject is up, chief.” One of them says.\n“Yeah, I could tell by her screaming. Okay, let’s get her started with the injections first, then I guess we’ll see the reaction and go from there.” The head doctor says.\n“Should be interesting.” Another says.\n“Maybe. I’m just glad we didn’t get that asshole Leslie Morningstar assigned to our group. Dodged a bullet on that one. Let those fuckers in C Wing put up with him and his sister.”\n\nYou panic, you struggle, you scream, you beg, you plead, you even call out for Bobby at one point, but none of it matters. The Ground Zero doctors begin to subject you to their experiments.\n\nYou have no idea how long this goes on for. Days, weeks, months? You never see Lilith or Leslie again and your world becomes to the surgical room to the observation room. You never see the rest of the Ground Zero facility.\n\nYour body is wracked with pain and goes through several ugly changes; your mind eventually becomes broken to the point of insanity though occasionally you have moments of clarity and that’s probably when you’re at your worst since you’re practically wishing to die. Several times the doctors prevent you from killing yourself.\n\nThe doctors themselves don’t really talk to you, but rather with each other like you’re not even there. You do hear one mention in passing about the world being nuked, but that hardly matters given the torture you’re being subjected to, indeed dying in a nuclear fire would be much kinder at this point.\n\nEventually through all their experimentation you become little more than a wild animal. Almost like what people back in town became, but even worse. It gets to a point where you actually manage to break what they thought to be strong enough shackles and kill three of the doctors experimenting on you.\n\nGround Zero security is called in and after enough bullets you are finally put down.\n",
  "page 135": "Well Donna would know better than you how fucked up it is at Julie’s house. You don’t particularly care for the idea of her just leaving her doors open for any potential nutjob to come in. You’d at least have some more control over that, if you lived in the trailer with Donna who will probably be gone most of the time anyway.\n\nAnd perhaps Donna’s observations of the trailer park are correct; maybe it isn’t as bad there as you’ve always believed.\n\nA few minutes of driving to your destination and you’re sure of one thing being pretty bad, the roads! Once again there are cops everywhere, but also ambulances and fire trucks racing to their various destinations too. Fortunately it seems to thin out as you leave town. Maybe this was a better idea after all.\n\nYou soon reach the trailer park, but you pull up near the entrance rather than inside it. You don’t know which trailer she lives in, so you figure the owner knows and you imagine he lives in the trailer up front with the signs on it saying “Inquire about trailers here.”\n\nYou get out of the car and go knock on the door.\n\n“Goddamnit stop fucking knockin’. I’m comin’!” you hear an old crotchety voice shout.\n\nThe door opens up and your eyes are “greeted” by the sight of a little old man wearing nothing but an open robe and boxer shorts. His body is wizened and wrinkled and he obviously has no modesty at all.\n\n“What the hell you want blondie? This ain’t a fuckin’ whorehouse.” He exclaims.\n“Uh, my sister Donna got a trailer from you the other day, I was just wondering where it was.” You ask.\n\nThe old guy looks you up and down, squinting the entire time.\n\n“I don’t know nuthin’ about no girl named Donna. All I do know is some whore yesterday sucked me off as down payment for a trailer. I don’t normally trade property fer pussy, but goddamn if that girl wasn’t lying about giving the best head ever…”\n\nWhile you sort of had an inkling of how Donna got a trailer so quickly, you didn’t really need to know the gruesome details. And now after seeing who she serviced to get it…you just want to change the subject.\n\n“Okay, anyway which trailer does she live in?” you ask.\n“She lives in the trailer at the far end of the park. Now unless you gonna rent a trailer wit money or yer lips too, get the hell outta my face an don’t bother me!” the old man shouts.\n\nAs you leave the old bastard he slams his door shut. You get back in the car and drive into the park.\n\nThe first thing you notice that you didn’t expect is how quiet the place is. You were expecting a lot more drama going on like on a bad daytime talk show, but you get none of that. You don’t even see anyone really around.\n\nEventually you approach the far end of the park, and there you see a trailer, which seems to stand out near a large open field. You’re guessing this one is it.\n\nYou park and approach the trailer and when you try the door that when you realize that you don’t have a key for this place. Donna apparently didn’t develop the bad habits of Julie either since the door is firmly locked.\n\n“Damn. (Sigh)” you say to yourself realizing that your choice is either wait all day in your vehicle, or maybe go back to to the manager who might have a spare key, though you’d rather not deal with him again.\n\n“Hey darlin’ never seen you before here! My name’s Jed!” a voice says.\n\nYou turn around and see a lanky redneck who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere.\n\n“Oh. Hey.” You say.\n“Hmm, you sure are beautiful. Yer even prettier than that girl that just moved in this trailer. You a friend of hers?”\n“Sister actually. Does the manager have spare keys to the trailers?” you ask.\n“That mean old bastard? Yeah, but if you need that open, you don’t need to go all the way back to him, here I can open it.”\n\nJed walks past you and pulls out some sort of tool and starts fiddling with the lock.\n\n“Hey, wait a minute, are you picking the lock?” you ask.\n“Well I ain’t ticklin’ it honey. Letssee…yeah…easier than breakin a virgin.” Jed says as the door easily opens for him with a click.\n\n“There you go sweetheart. So said that girl livin’ here now is yer sister? Guess good breedin’ runs in yer family.”\n“Uh…yeah guess so. Thanks, but I really want to just get all my stuff in and rest.” You say and turn to your car and there you see a huge man just staring at you like a gargoyle. It actually startles you, which Jed notices.\n\n“Oh don’t be afraid of him honey, that’s just my brother Hugo. He’s dumber than a bag of rocks, but he’s strong as hell. In fact he can carry yer bags in for ya.”\n\nAt this point Jed is getting uncomfortably close to you as he speaks and you’re starting to feel on edge with these two.\n\n“Look I thank you both for your help, but I really would like to be alone please.” You say firmly.\n\nJed looks at his brother then at you.\n\n“Whatever you say honey. Let’s go Hugo.” Jed says and the pair of them slowly leave and eventually disappear behind another trailer.\n\nNo longer being gawked at by the locals, you grab your bags from the car and haul them into the trailer.\n\nWhen you get inside, you see that it isn’t that bad. It’s definitely cheap looking, but it’s serviceable. You drop your bags by the sofa and quickly check the other areas like the bathroom and what you guess is a bedroom where Donna will sleep.\n\nJust as you’re turning around to check the kitchen at the other end, the door opens up and your heart sinks when you see Jed entering with what looks to be duct tape. He looks at you and a deranged smile is across his face.\n\n“Now I already know what’s goin’ through yer head blondie, cause I’ve done this a million times. Yer first instinct is gonna be to scream and make a fuss. Well lemme tell ya right now. Ain’t nobody gonna help yah. Most of ‘em are at the carnival, an the few that ain’t are either still passed out or ain’t gonna give a shit. Now we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\n\nDespite Jed’s warnings, you do the opposite of what he says and scream as loud as you can anyway, while running back into the bedroom in an attempt to look for anything to defend yourself. Jed wastes no time in following.\n\nUnfortunately there isn’t anything in the bedroom for you to immediately use since Donna doesn’t have any of her stuff here. You attempt to pick up the trailer’s TV in desperation, but Jed grabs you and throws you to the bed.\n\nYou struggle, but it’s no use. Jed is a dedicated murdering rapist with a mean streak a mile wide. After giving you a few punches to the face, you start to drift in and out of consciousness.\n\n“HUGO! HUGO! You can stop watchin’ the fuckin’ door and gimme a hand over here with this bitch. I reckon we both got time to have some fun with this one before handing her over to ol’ doc.” Jed exclaims while ripping your clothes off.\n\n“See Hugo? Told ya sticking around here would be better than the carnival.”\n\nIn your haze, you feel the violations at first. Pain, humiliation and anguish are all abundant at first, but then you go numb and then nothing when you pass out altogether.\n\nDuring your state of unconsciousness you have a brief dream of when you were much younger. When your mother was still alive and she was praising you about how good you are and how she anticipates great things in your future. It’s more of a distant memory than a dream in fact though in any event, it’s a nice “escape” from your horrible reality.\n\nWhen you wake up, you’re groggy, naked, incredibly sore and firmly strapped to a medical gurney of some sort. You also have a ball gag in your mouth. The room you’re in looks to be some sort of basement with a bright light hanging overhead.\n\nThe stench of chemicals fills the air and to your left in a darker corner of the room you see a man in a doctor’s coat hovering over another gurney with a body on it.\n\nNaturally in such a state you start to panic and ineffectively struggle to get free. The “doctor” hears you and walks over to you.\n\n“Oh, you’re up. I’ll have to give you more sedative. When Jed and Hugo brought you in, you weren’t in the best condition, though I’m glad they showed a little more restraint than usual.”\n\nAs you continue to try to struggle and make muted sounds to cry out, the doctor begins fondling you and moving his hands to roam all over your body.\n\n“Mmmm, nice. Though I appreciate a pretty face and I get the impression yours would’ve been a lot prettier had they not beat you up so much. Not to mention they both completely wrecked your rectum…I swear what the hell is it with rednecks and their pre-occupation for ass rape? Anyway, if I had the time, I’d probably still shove it in your vertical smile for a while, but sadly I don’t.”\n\nThe doctor goes over to a tray and grabs some sort of syringe he fully intends on use on you and you’ve gone from mere panic to sheer terror.\n\n“Really, you’re luckier than most that come through here. Normally I keep ‘em awake when I do my work, but I need you unconscious to take out those pretty eyes and other vital organs of yours. Wouldn’t want you thrashing about or blinking to cause me to cut them all up and making them useless.”\n\nYou watch helplessly as the needle goes into your arm. The tears run down your cheeks.\n\n“There we go. Won’t be long now. (Sigh) I swear it seems like I never get to enjoy my work any more though. I really would’ve liked to have fun with you. Oh well, I’ve got some other things to still look forward to.”\n\nYou drift into unconsciousness again and your life ends where you ironically spent most of your time.\n\nA basement.\n",
  "page 138": "“I’m still not sold on the trailer park, Donna. I think I’ll be fine here. I just need to get used to the new living situation.” You remark to Donna.\n“Hm, okay then. Well my offer will always still stand as long as I live there.” Donna replies.\n“Okay. Thanks Donna. So you said you’re good? You don’t need my help with anything?”\n“Nah, not tonight anyway. Like I said, I’ll come back and get all of my stuff proper, another day. Hopefully when the mess in town dies down.”\n\nSaying a few more goodbyes, you leave Donna to finish her hasty packing and you head back to your room and close the door. A few minutes later you hear the slam of the front door indicating that Donna has left, leaving you by yourself again.\n\nYou try to call Julie again, but once again there is no answer. Giving up on that particular concern you go back to amusing yourself on the Internet until you start reading erotic stories which puts you more in the mood to amuse yourself with your battery operated boyfriend again.\n\nHaving no distractions this time, you orgasm twice before having enough fun for the night. As you lie there in your afterglow, you briefly think about Bobby and how you sort of miss him, or rather his dick. Masturbation is fun and all, and it definitely gets the job done, but your time with Bobby has made you appreciate the human touch a little more. You really liked some of the tricks he did…\n\nSince you still aren’t one hundred percent sure about living here, you decide that you’ll call Bobby tomorrow and see if you can’t talk some sense into him and possibly make up.\n\nWith that goal for tomorrow decided, you call it a night and roll over on your couch to sleep.\n\nAt some point in the middle of the night, you hear a noise close by. You groggily open your eyes and see a figure standing over you with a large knife. Before you can scream or do anything, the person is on top of you and choking you with one hand. You can see his face right up to yours and he’s recognizable now with your eyes wide with fear. It’s Johnny.\n\n“Fucking whore! I heard what you did in here! I heard the dirty thing you did! I’m going to punish you like I did your friend!” he snarls with a look of pure hatred upon his face.\n\nYou punch and struggle and just as you think you’re having some success, Johnny proceeds to actually use his knife and stabs you repeatedly with it. With a last bit of strength you manages to push Johnny off of you and roll on the floor yourself, but your attempts to crawl away are short lived due to the combination of your wounds and the fact Johnny quickly recovers and begins stabbing you in the back.\n\nAs the life starts to fade from your body, you hear the heavy breathing of Johnny who is apparently starting to get aroused by your condition and begins ripping at your clothes.\n\nFortunately you die before you feel the pain of being raped on top of being murdered.\n",
  "page 137": "While you’re still not entirely sure about the trailer park, you have to admit the since you’ve been here in the house you’ve felt a little nervous at times. Almost like you feel someone is watching you. Silly of course, but maybe leaving town is a good idea if it’s getting as chaotic as it has been.\n\nYou just hope you’re making the right decision.\n\n“Yeah, okay. I’ll come with you.” You say.\n“You will? Great! Seriously, things will be better between us. I’m still really sorry about yesterday Suzy, here.” Donna says and hands you a bunch of money.\n“What’s this?”\n“It’s some of what I made today. Oh don’t worry, I still got a lot. I’m telling you with the money I’m making, we might even be able to find some place better to live in a few months! Okay, well I think I’m all packed, go grab your stuff and meet me in Tina’s car. Oh wait, I saw Peter’s car out there. Are you going to follow us in that instead?”\n“I suppose so, it will probably be less cramped.” You say and head downstairs to your room while Donna follows and heads out the door.\n\nIt doesn’t really take you long to throw your stuff in your bags since you didn’t really unpack that much. Just as you’re loaded up, you once again feel like you’re being watched. You spin around and see nothing.\n\n“You’re giving yourself the creeps Suzy. Nobody’s here.” You mumble.\n\nJust as you are exiting your room, it’s a minor miracle that Donna comes back in through the front door.\n\n“WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!?” you hear her scream from the living room. This causes you to pause just long enough that the assailant who was going to ambush you when you left your room losses his advantage.\n\nHowever, he’s still intent on killing you though and nearly succeeds in grabbing you, but you manage to back away in time.\n\nAs you back away you get a good look at him now and he’s not unfamiliar to you. It’s Johnny, but this time his face displays an utter hatred towards you.\n\n“Fucking whore! You think you could get away? I heard what you did in here earlier! I got something I can shove up in there to make you feel like you’ve never felt before and never will again!” Johnny screams and swing his knife at you.\n\nYou continue to back away, but there isn’t much room so you go around the desk for temporary relief, but even if you make it into the bathroom and lock the door you’ll just be trapped in there.\n\nYou’re so busy trying to survive, you completely forget that Donna is still in the house, but you soon remember when she runs in the room and clobbers Johnny in the back of the head with a small lamp.\n\n“Fuck…shit…” Johnny says crumpling to the floor. He’s not dead, but Donna’s too busy calling to you to run to finish him off.\n\n“Suzy! Come on! Get out of there!” Donna shouts and you waste no time in doing so.\n\nJust as Johnny struggles to get back up, Donna throws the lamp at his head and follows you.\n\nIn all the excitement you forgot if you have Peter’s keys, but Donna just shouts at you to get into Tina’s car as you exit the house.\n\nAs you both pile into the car, Tina is more than a little surprised.\n\n“What the fuck? Why are you two…”\n“Just drive! Drive! Drive!” Donna shouts.\n\nYou’re squashed a bit in the backseat with all the bags and panting heavily, but you’re glad you got out of there. Thought you’re understandably still shaken up.\n\n“We need to tell the cops!” you shout.\n“Tell them what? Have you seen this town Suzy? You think we’re going to get any help? Shit, I probably still got a warrant out on me!” Donna says.\n\nMeanwhile Tina is getting annoyed about being out of the loop.\n\n“Will one of you bitches tell me what the fuck is going on?! I mean this is my car and I’d like to know if we’re planning on getting shot at!” Tina snaps.\n“We’re fine. Well not fine, but nobody’s shooting at anyone. Some nut case with a knife was in the house and tried to kill my sister.” Donna replies.\n“And you didn’t kill him?”\n“No, I mean maybe. Shit, I dunno. I smacked him in the head twice with a lamp, but I don’t think I killed him.” Donna says.\n“(Sigh) You should’ve finished him off. I would have.” Tina says.\n“Tina, I’m not in the mood right now okay?!” Donna shouts.\n“Fine. Fine. I’m just saying you better watch yourself in the future. Anyway, I need to focus on getting us through this bullshit going on in town, because we could still be getting shot at.”\n\nThe rest of the drive is in relative silence, broken up periodically by Tina swearing at the road situation and your sister asking if you’re okay since you’re so quiet.\n\nYour quietness is due to still being shaken up by what just occurred and also because you just don’t have anything to say at the moment and are just hoping you get to where you have to get to in peace and in one piece.\n\nAfter a long drive, you eventually reach the trailer park. You look out the window at the various rundown trailers in the darkness and think “So this is what my life has come to.”\n\nFinally you stop at one towards the further end of the park close to undeveloped land and just regular wilderness. One thing you sort of were expecting was the drunken revelry of several hillbillies, and while you did see a few sitting around with some bottles in hand, it’s actually pretty quiet.\n\n“This is your place right Donna?” Tina asks.\n“Yeah, thanks Tina.”\n“Hm, well just be ready to go in the afternoon tomorrow. I’m not waiting around for you.” Tina replies.\n\nAs the pair of you get out and unload your bags from the car, Tina studies you a bit.\n\n“Y’know blondie, you’re not bad lookin’. If you ever loosen up a bit, you could easily get a job at Kitty City too. I think the school girl look would work for ya pretty well. You kinda got that innocent look.”\n“Yeah I don’t think so.” You say.\n“Hm, suit yerself. I’m just tryin’ to help YOU out. Whatever.” Tina remarks and backs the car up and swings it around to head back to her own trailer.\n\n“I still don’t like her.” You say.\n“Heh, well I’m not surprised. Come on, let’s get inside. I’ll give you the grand tour.”\n\nNaturally being a trailer, the “grand tour” doesn’t take long. Donna tried to make the place sound better than it is, but it’s better than you thought it would be, so it’s not awful. She points out the couch which will have to do for your sleeping accommodations.\n\n“Well Suzy, I know this is kind of a weird way to end the night given all that went down, but I’m really tired and I need to get some sleep, but before I do, did you need to talk about what happened?” Donna says.\n“Probably, but what good would it really do? I mean I’m starting to wonder if I’m a magnet for serial killers at this point. Uncle Ed, my ex, this asshole we just barely got away from…Oh shit! Julie!” you suddenly say thinking about the grim implications of what might’ve happened to her.\n\nDonna’s face drops a bit too.\n\n“Fuck. You said you haven’t been able to get a hold of her at all?” Donna asks.\n“No. Shit, that sick fuck probably killed her!” you exclaim.\n“Now we don’t know for certain. She could be…”\n“I KNOW for certain. That creepy fucker told me a story involving her leaving the house when I met him earlier today. He probably lied and actually killed her. Oh fuck this is bad. I mean I know I grew apart from Julie…but goddamn it…” you say getting a little teary eyed.\n\nDonna tries to console you, but she’s starting to get upset too. Really you haven’t seen her get sad for quite some time. Your sadness over the very likely loss of your friend is almost like a bonding experience. In between the tears you thank Donna for saving your life.\n\n“(Sniffle) Hey, you might’ve saved mine had you not called me to move out in the first place. I mean without you, I might’ve been very partying with that sicko and he could’ve killed me as well as Julie. (deep breath) Okay, tomorrow you come with me. I’ll try to convince Tina to drop you off at the police station. Hopefully you can make a report or something and we can at least get those corrupt fucks to look into it. Assuming things have settled down in town that is.”\n“Things have been really fucked up lately.”\n“Yeah, I dunno Suzy. I don’t place much stock in end times bullshit, but I guess those Ground Zero commercials they’re constantly blasting on the radio is starting to make me think something big is going to go down, though maybe it is already.”\n“Seems like it with the way my luck is going.” You say.\n“Hey, don’t worry sis. We’re going to get through this, no matter what comes our way. You and me. This is a brand new start for us, remember?”\n\nThis uncommon optimism does make you smile a bit at the fact you don’t have to deal with all this yourself.\n\n“Okay, Donna. (Yawn) I guess I better get some sleep. It’ll be a big day if I’m to make a report tomorrow. Thanks again for saving me, I’m never going to forget it.”\n“Hey, like I said, you probably saved mine as well. Good night Suzy.”\n“Night Donna.”\n\nDonna heads off to her bed and you eventually fall asleep on the couch.\n",
  "page 258": "Lilith’s right. Your choice is simple.\n\nAnd that’s the one that doesn’t involve going somewhere with a pair of sociopaths and a shady corporation.\n\n“Safest choice my firm ass it is.” You say to yourself.\n\nLilith’s psychobabble about you might’ve been a bit spot on in places, but it made you realize that not only is it not completely true, but that this past week you HAVE been making a concentrated effort to adapt to your surroundings.\n\nTrue, you haven’t been successful at it for the most part, but you’ve survived this long in this fucked up week, so you must not be too terrible at it either. Having to fend for yourself isn’t fun, but then being alone isn’t exactly new to you.\n\nIn any case, you still don’t trust Lilith and begin looking around the house and there in the kitchen, you pick up a fairly large butcher knife. Actually it isn’t a knife so much as it’s a machete. One can only imagine what the hell it’s doing in their kitchen, but you can take a guess.\n\nYou at first wonder if you should go try to kill Lilith or something, but then you think that probably isn’t the best plan. It’s likely to just end in your demise at the hands of her guards or her brother. You’re not some close combat expert and despite what Lilith said about you possibly “exploding into a ball of violent rage” you actually don’t have so much hate for her that you want to kill her without provocation. She actually might be telling the truth about the shelter as well rather than have any sinister intent.\n\nStill, you aren’t ready to take that chance either. While she has said she’ll just leave you in peace if decline the offer, you still have images of someone grabbing you, drugging you and taking you to the shelter against your will.\n\nSo that leaves one option. You’re going to go hide. The question is where though. Lilith’s upstairs, he brother is in the basement. You imagine if you hid somewhere on the ground floor, you’d get discovered pretty quickly…\n\nIt occurs to you, that you could just go out the backdoor and leave the premises for a while. You know they’re still in a hurry to get the hell out of here, chances are, they are not going to spend a whole lot of time looking for you, let alone looking for you off the grounds of the house.\n\nSo that’s what you do. You leave out the backdoor. Unfortunately the backyard has a high wooden fence so climbing it wouldn’t be the easiest thing to do (And chopping it with the machete, would just cause noise) and the gate leading to the side of the house is locked.\n\nYou see a shed, but you imagine that’s locked as well and it doesn’t seem like it would be a good place to hide. There are a couple trees in the yard and that’s when you notice that one of them has a few branches hanging over the fence.\n\nThe tree in question looks a lot easier to climb than the fence so you go up the tree which is slightly tricky with the machete still in your hand, but you soon make it to the branch you need to get to, drop the machete on the ground first and then drop down.\n\nAnd promptly land wrong and twist the hell out of your ankle as you crumple to the ground.\n\n“Fuck. Shit…” you start to curse until you stop yourself, when you hear a voice yelling on the other side of the fence.\n\n“I dunno where your blonde lab rat is, go get your guards to look. I’m trying to look for my favorite machete! I thought I had it in the kitchen, but it’s not there. I’m going to check the shed.”\n\nFrom your low angle and through the slats of the fence you can see Leslie walking towards his shed. Definitely turning back now as you’re most likely in possession of Leslie’s favorite machete and you really hope that this isn’t going to inspire a “hunt.”\n\nYou crawl away from the fence and the house as fast as you can. The pain in your ankle makes standing to “limp away” a bit more painful, but your desire to not get caught allows you to fight through it.\n\nThe high grass and the occasional bush or tree makes your escape into the “wilderness” slightly less nerve wracking since at least you aren’t in a completely open field where if they were looking for you, you would be an easy find.\n\nJust as you think you’re getting far enough away, you hear a voice call out your name in the distance. You freeze and turn your head to look behind you, but you don’t see anyone. You still hear Lilith’s voice shouting for you from far away, but you guess that she’s just doing it from near the house rather than actively searching for you.\n\nEventually you cease hearing her call for you and you take a breather within a cluster of trees. Actually you think if you went any further, you’d probably start going into a forest which you’re prepared to do if you think anyone is actually going to come looking for you. For now though, you need to rest your ankle a bit.\n\nA few moments pass and you don’t hear anything other than the occasional bird. A rabbit bounding nearby makes you jump a bit, but so far you don’t think anyone is coming out this way to look for you.\n\nStill, you can’t tell if they’ve all left yet. You decide to be on the safe side, you’ll wait a little longer. No more than that though since you really don’t want to get caught out here in the dark.\n\nSo you wait, keeping your eyes and ears open. Really before now, you didn’t realize how rural of an area you lived in. You don’t think you’ve ever appreciated the outdoors before…and you still don’t now.\n\nTime passes and still no sign of anyone heading your way. You decide they’ve probably left by now and it’s probably safe.\n\nYou ankle feels slightly better, but it still aches. As you try to keep your weight off of it and make your way back to the house, you suddenly hear rustling noise in the trees and bushes nearby. At first you think it’s another rabbit, but then you see exactly what it is\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim when you see a wild looking man with an equally wild look in his eyes. He sees you and makes that awful animalistic noise you heard while you were locked away in the basement and then sprints straight for you.\n\nFear grips you, but you know you can’t outrun it with your ankle not being a hundred percent. Your only saving grace is you aren’t completely defenseless.\n\nYou barely have time to react by the time it lunges upon you. You manage to swing your blade and as luck would have it you sink the blade across the thing’s face while its mouth was wide open.\n\nYou weren’t strong enough to cleave its head off, but it can’t really bite you with a machete blade in the way either. Still, that doesn’t stop it from tackling you to the ground, not to mention the blade is now stuck half way through its head and you couldn’t really pull it out if you wanted to what with it being on top of you now.\n\nWith blood spray all over you and this thing still trying to kill you, you do the only thing you can think of: You push the flat edge of the blade on your side and the handle so the machete cuts deeper into the thing’s head. It makes horrible squeals and shrieks, and keeps attempting to claw at your face, blood, teeth, bits of flesh are spraying/falling on you, but you keep the pressure on until at last you successfully shove the blade all the way through and the top of it’s head come off.\n\nAfter a bit more struggling, you get the thing completely off of you as it still attempts to kill you in its death throes. The thing continues to twitch and you’re busily looking around to make sure more of them aren’t coming or if the Morningstars are still around and heard all the noise. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around though. By the way this thing was dressed he even looked like he might be a camper so hopefully it was just him in the woods.\n\nYou just realize you killed someone…well someTHING at any rate. You don’t feel bad, since it was more out of necessity. You get the impression you might be killing more of these things in the near future, so better you get used to it now.\n\nYou quicken your pace to the house though still proceeding cautiously as possible. You hug the back fence and slowly edge your way around to the front of the house and you see that the Ground Zero vehicle is gone, along with the two guards that were out front.\n\nAt least that’s one thing you don’t need to worry about.\n\nYou enter the house through the still open front door and check the ground floor and find nobody around. The place is still a mess though. You’re about to check the upstairs when you see a piece of paper attached to the refrigerator with your name written in big black marker. You take it and read.\n\nSuzy,\n\nAssuming you came back here, I just want to say I understand why you ran off like you did and I probably wouldn’t have completely trusted you if the roles were reversed. Still, it is a shame we didn’t get to say a proper goodbye to each other. Leslie was quite angry with your theft of his favorite machete, but I talked him out of attempting to hunt you down for it. Not like we even need it where we’re going.\n\nAnyway, I imagine you should have power in this house for a couple days at least. There is food and drink in the fridge and in the cupboards. You’ll probably want to eat the stuff in the fridge first before the power goes out and spoilage occurs though.\nNot sure if you’ll like some of it, but considering you liked the meatloaf, maybe you’ll like what’s in there.\n\nGood luck Suzy, I certainly hope your foray into being a survivalist is successful. I mean that. You’re going to have to really push yourself and prepare for what is coming, but I think you’ve got a shot.\n\nLilith Morningstar\n\nP.S.\n\nThe other patients are still locked in the rooms in the basement. There are four of them in total and have already very likely broken their restraints by now. As I have said before, the doors should be more than enough to contain them and you should be safe from them as long as you don’t open the rooms.\n\nWell that was certainly a thoughtful note to you.\n\nYou sit down for a second thinking of what to do next. You thought that maybe you’d try to barricade this house up and stay here, but now you’re wondering if you shouldn’t just leave considering you’ve got four of those things clawing to get out of the basement. You to come to the conclusion that you might stay here another day tops and that’s only to just search this place of anything useful and then you’re heading out to well, you don’t know where exactly, but you’re going to continue to play this by ear.\n\nFor right now though, you really need to wash up. You’re covered in blood, gore, dirt and generally feel really gross. You really don’t want to use the shower in that room you were in during your time in the basement of this place though. You head upstairs in the hopes of finding another bathroom and sure enough you find one.\n\nLilith’s clothes are a slightly bigger size, but you can’t afford to be choosey since your own clothes are a bloody mess and it doesn’t make much sense changing back into them.\n\nDuring all this, you continue to keep your wits about you. Still afraid that something may pop up to attack at any time. By the time you’re out of the shower, night is beginning to fall.\n\nWhile you would’ve liked to have gotten started on searching the house you’re a little wary of turning on the lights in this house since it might very well attract more attention than you want. You do gather up a duffle bag that Lilith apparently decided not to use and plan to use that as your container for your search tomorrow.\n\nGiven that you’re staying here the night, you need to secure this house as much as you can. You lock the back door and the basement door. (And trying to ignore the noises you hear coming from down there) You then shove a sofa in front of the ruined front door. It’s not much, but if those things try to come in, you’ll most likely hear it at least.\n\nYou also realize you haven’t eaten all day, so you look in the fridge and grab something that looks similar to the meatloaf you ate yesterday since you don’t feel like making a decision.\n\n“Hm, Lil and Les really liked their meatloaf I guess.” You say and eat the stuff in the dark. (At least you don’t need to look at it this time) Tastes okay.\n\nYou’re up for quite awhile paranoid about every noise you hear. However, you know you can’t stay awake all night despite your paranoia.\n\nYou head back upstairs to one of the bedrooms and close the door. You then shove a dresser in front of it. Best you can do.\n\nYou then flop down on the bed and reluctantly let sleep take you.\n",
  "page 0": "SUNDAY\n\n\n“Are you worried about these uncertain times? Do you…”\n\nClick.\n\nYou’re so damn sick of these Ground Zero commercials you think as you turn the TV off. If you older brother Ben hadn’t shot his family and himself in a tragic paranoid breakdown you can only imagine he’d be going on about how right he was in building that underground bunker out in your backyard.\n\nYou look at the time and realize you’ve spent most of the day procrastinating watching TV even though there’s not much on that interests you on TV anymore. All the channels you used to watch that had interesting shit on them now all have shallow reality shows and quite frankly you’ve got enough dysfunctional family drama going on in real life without needing to watch it on TV.\n\nYou remember a time when you could avoid most of the mess by hiding out in your basement. Unfortunately you can’t even do that anymore. Ever since dad drank himself to death, the gravy train of living at home for free came to an end.\n\nWithout the help of your dad’s pension checks anymore, your older Amazonian sister Kelly said there was no way in hell that she was going to keep supporting the house on her own unless she was the only one living in it. Seeing as she’s a roller derby bitch as well as an illegal fight club brawler, it isn’t like you or any of your siblings were in any position to argue with her.\n\nYour younger brother Peter, having given up his lofty dreams of being a famous movie director now spends a lot of his time in the garage making amateur porn with various guys he picks up at the clubs. He makes enough money through his website that it keeps Kelly off his back. He seems to enjoy what he’s doing and at least he’s not stealing your clothes anymore.\n\nYour younger sister Donna simply moved out and moved in with your best friend Julie who is still the eternal party girl. Really you’re surprised Julie hasn’t caught every STD known to man at this point. To be honest Donna’s had more in common with Julie than you have for many years now. You’re sure Donna’s a lot happier at a “party house.”\n\nAs for you, you didn’t have much in the way of options. Trying to get a job has failed spectacularly in this economy. Though your…”unique” and reclusive personality doesn’t exactly help in that department.\n\nGiven some of the junk that’s laying around the house you sometimes wonder if you shouldn’t try to sell some of it over the Internet to support yourself. Seems like a lot of work though and you’re no wheeler and dealer.\n\nDonna suggested that you move in with her and Julie, but that whole scene isn’t for you. As much as you hate dealing with Kelly, you’d also hate having to put up with drunk horny guys (and girls) trying to get into your pants every five minutes, not to mention the loud music, crowds and the ever growing possibility of the cops busting the place for illegal drugs.\n\nWhich brings you to your boyfriend Bobby Morningstar who naturally has suggested that you move in with him on several occasions. This would be the ideal solution if it weren’t for the fact that his own family consists of like a million siblings that all live in his cult compound. There’s also the fact that his ex-girlfriend/sister Diana is wicked pissed at you for stealing him away from her.\n\nIt’s been an ongoing source of tension between you and Bobby and you wish he’d just leave them all behind and you two could make a life together elsewhere, but his duty to family is strong, as is his faith to the Babylonian Goddess of Chaos, Tiamat which still involves human sacrifices.\n\nRight now you’re having a period of separation with him. Sometimes you think about breaking up with him completely, but then you can’t just dismiss the good times you do have with him. You have that special bond that only a couple could have when one warns the other about their serial killer relative lying in wait for them in the woods. Thank god Bobby took care of your uncle Ed. That had to be the scariest moment of your life dealing with that situation.\n\nOf course none of this delightful recap of past events really helps you. Kelly is starting to get very impatient with you and you fear that your months of stalling are coming to an end.\n\nKelly’s currently not home, but she’ll be back in a few hours to get a bit of sleep before heading off to her fight club stuff. Continuing to enjoy the time you have to not have to deal with her you go back to procrastinating, which mainly involves goofing off on the Internet, “stumbling” upon a porn site and then using battery powered means to relieve yourself of stress.\n\nEventually you hear the familiar slamming of the door and stomping around upstairs, which signifies that Kelly is indeed home.\n\n“SUZY! Stop splittin’ the kitten and get yer bony ass up here!” you hear Kelly shout.\n\nYou were afraid of this. You clean yourself up a bit, mentally prepare yourself and then head upstairs.\n\n“Hey Kelly…” you start to say, but are interrupted.\n“Shut up. I’ve got exactly a couple hours to get some rest before I have to drag my ass to my other job to support this fucking house and it’s a fucking mess! You can’t even clean up around here? Did you even look for a job today? Let me guess you spent the whole day fucking around on the Internet and masturbating didn’t you?”\n“Well uh...”\n“Jesus fuckin’ Christ Suzy, you’re goddamn useless you know that? The only reason I’m not kicking your ass right now is because I need to save my energy and it would be too fucking easy.”\n\nBefore you can even speak, Kelly continues her rant.\n\n“GET A FUCKING JOB! I don’t care what kind! Just be a contributing member of this household like Peter or get the fuck out like Donna!”\n“Kelly I’m trying, but I’m just not having any luck in finding anything, can’t you help me out?” you say.\n“Help you out? I’m helping you out right now by supporting your ass! I’ve been helping you out for quite some time! In fact I originally suggested that you could probably become a ring girl at the fights, but you said no because you didn’t want to dress up in skimpy clothing and parade around in front of a bunch of drunks.”\n“Kelly, you know I don’t want to dress like that in public, especially not after what uncle Ed made me wear that night…”\n“Oh here we go, crazy old uncle Ed! How long you going to keep using that as an excuse? Sheesh, the way you go on about it, you act like he raped you. What happened instead? He got killed, you weren’t even touched and you got a fucking boyfriend out of that deal! Some of us should be so lucky to be in a fucked up situation and STILL come out ahead! You know what I deal with on a regular basis? Steroid freaks trying to break my fucking neck that’s what! You think I’d be making a living trading punches with fucktards if I LOOKED like you Suzy? You got the biggest advantage and you’re just wasting it! What the hell is your goddamn problem?”\n\nYou can see that Kelly is in full-blown jealousy mode and shows no signs of stopping. Attempting to walk away will only result in her getting physical with you so the only thing you can do is endure the verbal assault.\n\n“This is sink or swim time sis. You either get your shit together by the end of this week or you’re out on your ass! This sheltered girl act is really fucking OLD! You’re a grown ass WOMAN. Start acting like one! Now get out of my fucking sight.”\n\nYou meekly slink back to the basement and leave Kelly alone.\n\nYou silently mope for a while pondering what the hell you’re going to do next. You then notice that your phone has been under your couch cushions and on silent all day. Bobby apparently has been repeatedly trying to contact you. Even left multiple texts saying that he really wants to talk, but the mood you’re in right now, you don’t want to deal with it.\n\nYou don’t want to deal with anything. You just want to be safe in your own little world in the basement. How you miss those days…\n\nWell today isn’t completely over yet. You’ve still got time to salvage some of it. Hell, maybe you can even make a major change in your life.\n",
  "page 260": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of a noisy vehicle outside. You waste no time in springing to your feet.\n\nYou cautiously peek out the window and see a beat up pick up truck pulling up behind Lilith’s shot up vehicle. You then see two familiar figures get out of the truck with one of them speaking loud enough for you to hear even from your position.\n\n“Woowee! Looks like we missed some shit going down around here! Make sure you keep yer eyes peeled! Thinkin’ Doc might not even be alive anymore!” Jed exclaims.\n\n“Shit. What the fuck are those two assholes doing here?” you say to yourself.\n\nYou see Hugo and Jed both carrying shotguns and going to the back of the pick up, which from your vantage point you can see a pile of blankets in the bed of the truck. Jed uncovers the blanket and reveals a naked woman tied up with ropes. She looks dirty, beaten and bloody. You can’t quite tell if she’s dead, but she’s definitely unconscious.\n\nYou then see Jed say something to his brother and points to the house. Hugo nods and you see him walk out of your view. You temporarily freeze up when you hear a knock from downstairs. You hear it several times until you hear Jed shouting at his dim-witted brother.\n\n“Jesus fuckin’ Christ Hugo, are ya stupider than usual today? Can’t ya see that door is already hangin’ off the fuckin’ hinges? Just go in, and fuckin’ check the place out, then let me know if Doc’s even around or not. I’ll be out here keepin’ this fierce one entertained.” Jed shouts and you see him patting the leg of the girl a couple times.\n\nThe knocking becomes a crashing sound as you hear Hugo bashing the door in and probably moving the sofa in the process. You turn your attention away from what’s going on outside and how you’re going to handle this situation.\n\nYou think about climbing out the window and on to the roof, but that’s a risky proposition. Not really so much of the risk of falling (Though your ankle still hurts a bit) but more because Jed is practically in front of you and if he just bothers to till his head up or hears you, he’s going to see you and probably open fire.\n\nYou look around the room and hoping maybe there is a firearm or something that Lilith didn’t take, but you don’t find anything. That dresser you put up against the door isn’t going to last long if Hugo tries to come in here.\n\nYou suppose you could just try shoving move stuff against it, but considering he not only looks extremely strong, he’s got a shotgun and could probably just blast his way through.\n\nYou hear Hugo stomping around downstairs.\n\nIf Hugo comes up here, and you hide in the closet, there’s the possibility that you could get the drop on him as he walks in.\n\nYou wonder though if it might not be more advantageous to just head downstairs and try to sneak up on him now though. If he comes up and things go to shit, you aren’t going to have any place to run to, especially if he traps you in this room.\n",
  "page 141": "While it didn’t work out the first time, there really isn’t any reason to not hesitate to run now. The soldiers are obviously out of control and it’s possible they’ll just line you up and start shooting you. You stand up from your crouching position and run over to the trailer door.\n\n“Suzy, what the hell, keep the fuck down! They’re still firing out there!” Donna exclaims as you step over her.\n“Donna, you’re the one who said you wanted to get out of here quickly, well we can’t waste time! Now get up and let’s go!” you shout and grab the door handle.\n\nYou open the door, which to your surprise reveals a soldier who was just about to open the door. Startling the soldier, he loses balance backwards a bit, but he doesn’t lose his trained instinct to defend himself unfortunately for you.\n\nThe guardsman fires and you take several bullets to your body. You’re dead before you even hit the floor of the trailer as your sister screams at this sight.\n",
  "page 262": "Better to stay put and surprise attack him that way. Quite frankly if you don’t get the drop on him, you’re probably not going to get the chance to run anyway.\n\nYou get the closet and hide in the extra niche space within it. Hugo comes kicking in the door, he wanders in and probably looks around the room first, and then you attack hoping you kill him before he shoots you.\n\nYou took out one of those rabid things by yourself and that was pretty dangerous right? You can do this. You can do this. You can do this.\n\nYou convince yourself as you wait in a closet to ambush a large and heavily armed retarded redneck rapist…\n\nYou wait, still hearing Hugo clomping around and probably knocking shit over if the sounds are any indication. You also start hearing some shouting outside. You can’t tell what’s going on, but you’re more focused what’s going on inside.\n\nAt any time, you expect to hear the sound of boots loudly stomping up the stairs, but you don’t, in fact the sounds of Hugo’s stomping get faint and soon you’re not hearing it at all.\n\nAt first you think maybe he went back outside, but then it occurs to you that Jed told Hugo to look for Leslie. And if Leslie were here, he’d probably be in the basement so that might be where Hugo went.\n\nYou cautiously come out of the closet and try to listen for Hugo, but the only thing you’re hearing now is Jed making “whooping” noises as well as shrieking. You peek out the window again just to see what the hell is going on.\n\nYou see the girl that was in the bed of the truck now bent over the tailgate and Jed raping her. Her arms are still tied behind her back, but she’s not unconscious anymore. She’s obviously squirming and making the shrieking sounds you heard before. Something isn’t right though, and it’s not just the whole rape thing. The noise that this woman is making doesn’t entirely sound…well “natural.”\n\nYou think she might be one of those crazies. That doesn’t seem to bother Jed however, he just keeps laughing and punches her in the back of the head every once in a while to “calm” her. His shotgun is leaning up against the side of the truck. You guess he got over the idea of “catching” something.\n\nYou shake your head at this fucked up situation and then suddenly you hear a shotgun blast from within the house.\n\nYou then remember there are still four of those things locked up in those rooms in the basement. You have no idea if Hugo’s just opened up one of the doors and killed one, or they’ve gotten out on their own though. You don’t hear another gunshot, so you also don’t know if he successfully killed it or it (or they) possibly got him.\n\nMeanwhile the shot briefly get Jed’s attention and he actually stops raping for one minute, but then he quickly goes back to it and starts shouting at the crazed woman.\n\n“Hah! Sounds like my brother just put another one of you crazy bitches down!” he exclaims and then slams her face into the bed of the truck.\n\nWell it seems like both brothers are suitably distracted and divided which is the best situation you’re going to get.\n\nIdeally, you’d take out Jed first and grab his shotgun. The only problem is there is no way you can really sneak up on him since his line of sight is directly in front of the house. Walking out the front door even quietly as possible and even with him in the middle of his rape of one of the rabid, if he sees you, it won’t take him long to grab his shotgun and open fire.\n\nHugo on the other hand might very well already be dead for all you know. If he is, that doesn’t necessarily mean things are going to be any easier with one of those insane people or possibly more than one lurking around free in the basement. Even if he isn’t dead, the same problem arises that you’re going to have when you thought he might come up the stairs. Might even be harder given the corridors don’t allow for many places to hide and he’s going to be more alert now.\n\nWhether Hugo is alive or there are a group of cannibals eating him right now, you still feel like Jed would be easier for you to deal with armed only with a machete.\n\nYou move the dresser and cautiously leave the bedroom. You continually keep looking around as you head towards the stairs.\n\nYou make your way down the stairs and try to keep your head low so you don’t possibly get seen through one of the broken windows.\n\nThe front door is wide open and you can see Jed with the girl. Right now he’s got his head down and isn’t paying attention to what could be in front of him, he’s too busy slamming his dick into crazy woman and keeping her from getting away from him.\n\nAs quickly and as quietly as you can, you slip out the front door and hide behind one of the front porch pillars. You think if you’re quick enough you could make it to hide behind the front Lilith’s vehicle and then from there just crawl alongside that vehicle to Jed’s vehicle, grab the shotgun and you’re home free.\n\nYou peek around the pillar and see Jed’s still engrossed in his activity. You immediately make the attempt…\n\nThen another shotgun blast emanates from the house just as you’re a the bottom of the front stairs causing you to stumble a bit and Jed to look up.\n\nYour eyes meet.\n\n“SHIT!” pair of you shout and Jed starts fumbling with his dick and pants.\n\nYou MIGHT make it if you make a sprint to grab the shotgun, but then again you might not and not getting it, means game over.\n\nYou’ve probably got a better chance if you run back into the house, but in that case you’re going to be playing a game of cat and mouse with him and considering you just heard a second gunshot, it would seem Hugo is probably alive too.\n",
  "page 140": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n“…act now and spend your life in the comfort of…”\n\n“Oh shut the hell up…I already know the world is going to hell in a hand basket.” You hear Donna say while she turns off the TV as you groggily wake up from the couch.\n\n“What time is it?” you ask.\n“It’s past noon that’s for sure. Still a few hours to go before we have to get ready to leave.”\n“Oh. How long you been awake?”\n“Hm, not long. The shower’s all yours though, I’ve already used it.”\n\nYou sit up still getting used to your new surroundings\n\n“Hm, you were right, it really isn’t what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting to hear the sounds of drunken hillbillies arguing and shooting off guns when I woke up. It’s actually pretty quiet.” You say gathering so clean clothes.\n“Heh, well I can’t say that probably won’t happen around the holidays, but like I said, I think you’ll find that even the trashiest of people aren’t acting like stereotypes all the time.” Donna replies.\n\nYou nod and head off to take a shower. While you wash up, you try to mentally prepare yourself for your trip to the police station today. Part of that involves relaxing yourself and relieving yourself of tension in the usual way that hasn’t failed you yet…\n\nA few minutes later…\n\n“SUZY! SUZY! GET DRESSED WE GOT A FUCKING SITUATION OUT HERE!” you suddenly hear Donna say as she beats on the bathroom door.\n\nAs startling as that is, what you hear next is even more so due to a loud bullhorn.\n\n“THIS IS THE NATIONAL GUARD. THIS AREA IS NOW UNDER MARTIAL LAW! ALL INHABITANTS WILL EXIT THEIR TRAILERS AND AMASS IN THE CENTER FOR OBSERVATION! ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO RUN OR RESISTING WILL BE SHOT!”\n\nSo much for putting your mind at ease.\n\n“Alright! Alright! I hear what’s going on! I’m getting out!” you shout.\n“Hurry!” Donna says.\n\nYou stop your shower, grab your clean clothes and start getting dressed as quickly as possible.\n\nTina is looking out one of the windows when you exit the bathroom.\n\n“There are a couple of military trucks with a bunch of guardsmen out there. I don’t know what’s going on, but this is really bad. Shit. This has gotta have something to do with what’s been going on in town.” Donna says.\n“They want us to go out there too.” You say not being enthusiastic about that idea.\n“Yeah, fuck that. It’s probably just so they can kill us easier if we’re all huddled up in a group or worse, maybe they want to round us up in those trucks for some sinister purpose.”\n\nOdd that Donna always thought your older brother was a kook for talking like that on regular basis, but she sounds more like him than ever right now. To be fair though, this is all pretty strange and you’re not exactly trusting of the situation yourself.\n\n“Well what are other people doing?”\n“Some are coming out and some are staying in. In fact more are staying in than coming out, but that’s hardly surprising. The folks around here aren’t exactly fond of the government.”\n\n“EVERYONE OUT OF THEIR TRAILERS NOW! THIS IS NOT A CHOICE, IT’S A FUCKING ORDER!”\n\nYou and Donna look at each other.\n\n“This isn’t going to end well. Maybe we should run.” Donna suggests and you nearly laugh.\n“Yeah, because the plan to run worked SO well for me last time!” you say.\n“Okay this is different, we really would be running off together. Come on, do you really think those soldiers out there are any better than those cops that pulled us over? In fact they sound worse!”\n“Well you got a point there, (sigh) okay so what’s the plan? We just step out the trailer and run? They already said they’re going to open fire on anyone who does that.” You say.\n“Yeah, but we’re lucky since we have a trailer at the end of the park. We could probably make a run for it and hide in the wilderness behind the park.”\n“That simple huh? How long are we supposed to hide out there? I don’t know how to survive in the wild and unless you been secretly reading up such things, I don’t think you do either.”\n“Well I don’t fucking know! I’m just trying to come up with suggestions here! Fuck Suzy, I’m trying to help YOU out as usual.”\n“Thanks. Thanks for that Donna. Real helpful right now.”\n\n“EVERYONE EXIT THEIR TRAILERS RIGHT FUCKING NOW! THIS IS YOUR LAST FUCKING WARNING OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE AND THESE RUN DOWN PIECES OF SHIT WILL BE YOUR GODDAMN COFFINS!”\n\nYou look out the window briefly and see the few people that have exited their trailers are being shoved roughly in the center of the park. Some of the guardsmen stand nearby pointing their rifles at them, but nothing more yet.\n\nA few more of the guardsmen are starting to spread out and move about the park. It looks like they’re preparing for combat.\n\nAnd then suddenly you see one of the locals kick their door open and yell something at the top of their lungs while blasting one of the soldiers with a shotgun before getting riddled with bullets.\n\nThen all hell breaks loose.\n\n“Get down!” you shout and you and Donna are both getting as low as you can on the floor. Gunfire, shouting and screaming is all you can hear and you’re praying that a stray doesn’t go through the wall and hit you.\n\nDonna apparently has the same idea.\n\n“Suzy, we gotta get the fuck outta here!”\n“Donna we go out that front door and we risk an even bigger chance of getting our asses shot off! We need to just stay low and behind as much shit as possible! Maybe your bedroom or the shower in the bathroom would be…”\n\nA couple of bullets go through the windows overhead and small shards of glass sprinkle to the floor.\n\n“That’s it, I’m not fucking staying here!” Donna yells and starts to crawl to the door of the trailer.\n",
  "page 261": "Either way you’re going to have to get the drop on him, better you have more places to run to, rather than just being trapped in one room.\n\nAs quietly as you can you move the dresser out of the way of the door and exit the bedroom. You still hear Hugo clomping around downstairs and you actually wait around the corner of the stairs hoping that maybe if he is heading upstairs you can ambush him that way.\n\nWaiting doesn’t prove fruitful though and in fact you think Hugo’s footsteps are actually getting fainter. It then occurs to you, he’s probably looking for Leslie and Leslie would be down in the basement.\n\nYou cautiously head downstairs though you do it fairly quickly since the last thing you want is to be wrong and get caught going half way down the stairs while Hugo is going up them.\n\nAfter a quick look around on the ground floor and keeping your ears open you’re not hearing or seeing Hugo down here. You are starting to hear Jed shouting from outside though. When you peek out the window, you can’t quite see everything, but you notice Jed is clearly doing something with the woman that was in the back of the truck. You can guess what that might be given his movements and vulgar shouting.\n\nYou head towards the stairs of the basement and you nearly fall down them when you’re startled by a sudden gunshot coming from down there. Hugo must’ve just shot one of the four “patients” down there. Of course it’s hard to know if he’d opened a door and killed one or perhaps it managed to get out on its own. Either way, you’re going to have to be really careful.\n\nYou get to the basement floor and the noise of those things is much louder. You peek around the corner and down the corridor you see two doors to the rooms open. The closest one you know was yours, so nothing in there. The second one however looks like it also has a dead body lying partially in the entryway.\n\nYou see Hugo in the corridor opening up another door across the hall of the other two open ones. He isn’t really paying much attention to your direction and when he steps into the other room, you make a dash for your old room and get inside.\n\nAlong with hearing the banging of the creatures still locked up, you hear another shotgun blast signifying Hugo’s killed another one. You figure before he opens up the next door, you run up and chop him in the back of the head.\n\nYou peek out from behind the door and see Hugo exiting the room. He walks to the middle of the corridor and begins fiddling with his shotgun, as if he’s having trouble with it.\n\nJust then the door across from him bursts open and one of the patients attacks him. You see and hear them struggle, growling, yelling, and everything else that comes with a life or death situation.\n\nIt gets more interesting however when you see Hugo drop the shotgun as he’s struggling with the patient.\n\nYou waste no time and rush from your position to nab it. Hugo meanwhile is still struggling with the patient who has now bitten into Hugo’s hand. You’re about to put a hole in the pair of them and that’s when the door to the room containing the last patient bursts open.\n\nThe thing seeing that one of its “fellows” is already struggling with Hugo, it screams and lunges forward to attack you instead.\n\nYou instinctively turn the shotgun towards the patient and pull the trigger, unfortunately it doesn’t work which is why Hugo was fiddling with it earlier. It was jammed.\n\nBefore you can pick your machete back up to defend yourself, the thing has already tackled you. You struggle for a moment, but this one is a lot stronger than the one you fought with yesterday. It soon overpowers you and its teeth are ripping your throat out and its fingers are clawing your eyes out.\n",
  "page 143": "Running or rather planning to run didn’t work before so you’re not even going to entertain the idea now.\n\n“Donna, get the fuck back here! You might be about to outrun cops, but you can’t outrun a bullet!” you shout crawling backwards towards the bathroom.\n“Suzy, you need to stop being so scared all the damn time! NOT running before is why you had to suffer through what you did last time! If you’re smart, you’ll come with me!”\n“Donna, I’m telling you, it’s going to be bad if you go out there!”\n“It’s gonna be bad if we stay…AAAH!”\n\nYou’re already inside the bathroom when you hear Donna scream, at first you think she got shot, but it’s something equally as bad.\n\nThe moment she was opening the front door, so was a soldier, trying to look for respite from the shooting. You peak around the corner and see him barge in and pick Donna up by the hair.\n\n“Get up! Get up you fucking trailer bitch!” you hear the soldier shout.\n\nDonna whimpers and begs to be let go. You think you hear a slap followed by another. You slink back into bathroom as panic wells up inside you.\n\n“Fucking trash, you got a weapon on ya? Where the fuck is your boyfriend? He in the back waiting to ambush me? Well fuck that! Come on out you goddamn redneck! Got your bitch here or is it also your sister? Fuckin’ inbreds!”\n\nYou hear Donna continue to plead and exclaim she lives alone and that she has no weapons of any kind. The guardsmen doesn’t sound completely convinced and you hear him pushing Donna and exclaiming for her to head towards the bedroom swearing the whole time about his shitty assignment, you know its only a matter of time before he discovers that you’re here.\n\nYou hastily look around the bathroom, but there isn’t much here in the way of weapons except a can of your sister’s hairspray. Maybe you can blind him, though you’d need to time it just right.\n\nTaking a deep breath, you get near the entryway of the door prepare the can…\n\nYour sister passes by and sees you out the corner of her eye, but makes no indication that she’s seen you.\n\n“Just keep going. If there really is nobody in the bedroom, then we’re just going to hide out in the back for a while and then…ARGH! SHIT!” the soldier exclaims as you unload the hairspray in his eyes as he starts to pass the bathroom entrance.\n\nFortunately he drops his rifle in the process of his sudden blindness, which you quickly snatch up. Donna is still scrambling to get up and get out of the way, meanwhile the blind soldier is backing up trying to fish his pistol out of his holster.\n\n“Fucking…shit…I’m gonna kill all of you inbred trash! I’m…”\n\nYou don’t wait around for him to possibly carry out his threats; you don’t think about it, you just shoot. The rifle kicks a bit and you hurt yourself in the process, but your assailant with several new holes in him is in even worse condition. He drops his pistol and slumps backwards in a bloody heap.\n\nFor a moment you just stand there in disbelief on what you’ve done. You just killed a man. Even if it was life and death, you still killed someone.\n\n“Suzy! Get down, they’re still shooting out there!” Donna shouts from the bedroom entrance.\n\nYou get down on the floor still clutching on to your killing tool and crawl to the bedroom. You feel a bit weird, but not sick.\n\nYou and your sister hide behind her bed, huddled close to each other as the shooting and general mayhem out there continues for what seems like a very long time, but in reality it’s only about fifteen-twenty minutes.\n\nAs the gunshots die down, you can hear the victory hooting and hollering outside which is then followed by more gunshots probably fired in victory.\n\nFor a moment you and your sister stay down for a little while longer, but eventually the pair of you get up. You just sit on the edge of the bed trying to wrap your head around everything that just happened.\n\nDonna on the other hand peeks out one of the windows.\n\n“Well, I guess our side won.” Donna says.\n“Not sure if that’s going to be a good thing in the long run.” You say.\n\nDonna doesn’t pay much attention to your statement, but instead heads to the main room of the trailer. After a few moments, you gather your strength and follow her.\n\nShe looks at the dead soldier on the floor and you do as well.\n\n“Well, I guess it’s true what they say, you never know if you can kill someone or not until you have to.” Donna remarks.\n“Or want to.” You add.\n“Well anyway I’m glad you did. Shit, that was fucking intense. The weird thing is how well worked together in the situation I mean I lured him to the back and you ambushed him.”\n“Yeah, well I suppose we already had several run-throughs of dealing with hostile assholes this week. We were bound to get it right eventually.” You remark.\n“Heh, I suppose so…well no point in letting this asshole stink up the place, let’s drag him outside.”\n\nDonna gets his legs and you get his upper body and drag the soldier out of the trailer. As you do so, you notice his rank is that of a high-ranking NCO. You wonder if he was the one in charge of this detachment.\n\nWhen you get him outside, Tina is just walking up with a scruffy looking man wearing a cap and clothing that doesn’t look like its been washed in days. He carries a shotgun over his shoulder.\n\n“Well fuck Donna. Did you actually kill one of those fuckers?” Tina asks.\n“Not me, my sister did. This asshole barged into our trailer and Suzy shot his ass.”\n\nTina looks a little impressed.\n\n“Is that so? Well maybe I misjudged you blondie. Maybe you’re not the innocent wallflower I thought you were.”\n“I didn’t take any pleasure in it, if that’s what you’re implying.” You say defensively.\n\n“Of course you didn’t. You saw a threat to your family and home and you took care of business. It’s what any right thinking American SHOULD do when the fucking government tries to impose its will on folks. They tried to do it here, well they didn’t fucking succeed. We showed them that, but I reckon there’s gonna be a lot more trouble comin’. Believe it.” The man suddenly says.\n“Who are you?” you ask almost in an accusing tone.\n\nMel doesn’t really look offended, but Tina speaks up before he can.\n\n“This is Mel, my…significant other.” Tina says.\n“Significant other? What the fuck are we fucking faggots? Life partners and all that shit? Just say I’m your goddamn boyfriend. Shit, I’m practically your husband with as long as we’ve been together.”\n“I hesitated to call you my boyfriend because I don’t know where we exactly stand right now and until you buy me a fucking ring and propose, you’re definitely NOT my husband!”\n“Pftt, I told ya, I see no reason for a piece of paper handed out by some bean counter to tell me how I feel about ya, let alone some piece of jewelry. Besides, we fight all the fucking time and always get back together, so stop bein’ a fuckin’ drama queen.”\n\nAt this point Tina and Mel start to argue and not wishing to get in the middle of it, you and Donna start to walk back to your trailer. When you get inside Donna starts finding bags and begins putting away clothes.\n\n“What are you doing?” you ask.\n“What’s it look like? I’m packing up my shit and getting ready to get the hell outta here. It’s apparent that you were right again, about this place. It’s not safe here.” Donna says.\n“At this point, I don’t think its too safe anywhere. At least the immediate threat here has been eliminated.” You say.\n\nDonna stops packing.\n\n“Wait a minute. Are you serious? This can’t be happening. I mean YOU of all people. Are you seriously considering staying here?”\n“I don’t know. I mean would I like there to be a better option? Yes! But what options do we really have Donna? We don’t even have a fucking car to leave in and I doubt very seriously anyone is going to let us borrow a vehicle now. We’re going to be on foot, heading to god knows where. I mean WHERE are we going to go? Back to town? With all the bullshit going on there? Into that wilderness where we can slowly starve to death due to our lack of survival knowledge? Further down the road where we’ll run into who knows what? I mean everything seems so chaotic right now and I want at least a stable chance of survival. Your plan has always been to run and so far it hasn’t worked out very well either for me or you. Maybe we need to dig our heels in and tough it out if only for a bit.”\n\nDonna sits down on the couch processing your words. She probably can’t believe you’re even thinking this way, and to be honest you can’t either. Maybe killing another human changed something within you and you’re not willing to just sit around and be a victim anymore. You’re going to DO something to improve your situation. Anything.\n\n“Okay, I get what you’re saying. And yeah you’re right that it’s going to suck walking to wherever our unknown destination is going to be and we don’t know where we would go, but I’m just saying it HAS to be safer than staying here. I mean if we do stick around, what if the government sends another group of soldiers here? It’s going to look mighty suspicious that the last group they sent isn’t here and will probably be really bad for us. If we leave, we can at least distance ourselves from this mess. I dunno, I mean at this point I’ll stick with you no matter what you decide, I just think we oughta get the fuck outta here.” Donna advises.\n",
  "page 264": "You turn around and try to get back in the house as quick as you can. You hear Jed shout at you to stop, but you don’t listen, you just to get in the front door.\n\nYou don’t quite make it and feel the burning pain a slug hitting the back of your left leg. Not only do you scream in agony, you also fall straight on you your face.\n\n“Stupid bitch, I told ya, to stop!” Jed shouts.\n\nYou don’t even look at your leg, but you sense that it may just be barely attached to the rest of your body at this point. The agony is so bad you feel like you’re going to be sick or go unconscious at the same time.\n\nAgainst all odds you continue to try to crawl into the entryway of the house.\n\n“HEY! I SAID STOP FUCKING MOVING! Goddamnit…” you hear Jed shout and you expect to another shot, but instead you hear shouting of a different kind.\n\n“ARGH! FUCK!”\n\nYou manage to turn your head enough to see Jed being attacked by the rabid woman he was violating. She’s bitten him, but he’s still managing to fight her off. You use this opportunity to continue to crawl away. You manage to get back inside, and you hear another gunshot followed by more swearing. Your heart sinks since that means Jed must still be alive.\n\nThe combination of fear and pain is clouding your thoughts of everything save for trying to get away, but you know that’s not going to happen.\n\nYour fears become reality when you’re only half way up the stairs to the second floor and hear footsteps coming into the house.\n\n“I hear ya whimpering girl and I can see the bloody mess yer leavin’. Won’t be half as messy though when I get through with ya!” you hear Jed shout.\n\nYou soon hear him on stairs behind you.\n\n“Dunno, why yer goin’ up there for, your fate is sealed sick girl. Didn’t seem so sick out there when you were trying to reach for my shotgun. Bet you thought pullin’ one over on me a couple days ago was really funny. Well I guess I’m the one laughing now. Since I didn’t finish with my ex-girlfriend back there, guess you’ll have to fill in for her.\n\nYou suddenly feel a hand grip your good leg and pull hard. As you’re dragged, you make one last ditch effort to fight, by twisting your body and swinging the machete you’re still carrying in your hand.\n\nYou manage to catch Jed’s arm sinking the blade in. He yells, lets go and falls backwards down the stairs. Unfortunately with his other hand that still holds the shotgun, he pulls the trigger on it.\n\nYou’re hit again and it’s a quick death as part of your head and brains are splattered all over the stairs and walls, which at least spares you of any further suffering.\n",
  "page 167": "You’re likely going to get shot or worse if you try to steal the keys or the truck. There are too many rednecks around and they’re probably better with their weapons than you are. It’ll be much easier to just sneak away. At best they might call out and search for you, but eventually Mel or their own common sense will tell them that you aren’t worth risking their lives sticking around for.\n\nYour group goes into the grocery store, which must still have on some sort of emergency lighting where upon everyone begins to carefully search the place. While there has been some looting and even signs of fighting that went on here, the place is in better shape than anyone thought.\nYou grab one of the hand baskets and gradually start distancing yourself from the rest. You start loading up on some nearby cans, which you aren’t really paying much attention to since you’re more focused on what the other members of your group are doing.\n\nWhen you see that you’re far enough away from them and they seem preoccupied with other things, you take the opportunity to head back outside. Still making the effort to not look suspicious just in case, you put the handbasket into the bed of the pick up truck and then when you’re sure nobody is watching that’s when you run.\n\nYou run from the grocery store and don’t even look back. You half expect to hear some shouting telling you to stop, but you don’t hear any.\n\nWhen you get far enough away you keep a quick pace, but slow down a bit since you’re losing you’re breath. You’re really going to have to get used to exercising on a regular basis to boost the endurance you think.\n\nThe one thing that sticks out as you’re walking through your neighborhood is how eerily quiet it is. You still see signs of destruction and even dead bodies, but you’re not seeing a living soul. On one hand it’s great that you aren’t being assaulted by cannibal freaks, but on the other hand it makes you wonder what the hell happened in your neighborhood to result in it being such a ghost area. At this point you’re worried that maybe somebody hidden is watching you.\n\nDespite all your concerns, nothing attacks or otherwise hinders you by the time you get home. You’re anxious to get in as well. You know it’s only going to be a temporary respite, but at least you’ll get a bit of peace while you ponder what to do next. Maybe you can look for that hidden shelter your brother built in the backyard.\n\nAs your tired feet hit heavily on each front step, you briefly wonder if either of your siblings are home. Peter’s car isn’t in the driveway, but then you did leave it at Julie’s. If he’s still here, you suppose you’ll have to explain what happened on that front. Kelly’s vehicle isn’t here either, so maybe your home has been abandoned.\n\nThe front door of course is predictably locked, but fortunately you still have your key to it in one of your pockets. It’s amazing how you instinctively put it in there despite you not really ever expecting to come back here.\n\nYou open the front door and find that your home has not been abandoned, you also see your sister Kelly standing front of you holding a shotgun.\n\n“I heard you clomping out there on the steps. Figured you might be one of those psychos or something. Didn’t expect to see you though. While I’m a little impressed that you obviously managed to survive this fucking chaos, you never should’ve come back here sis. I told you before this is MY house.” Kelly says.\n\nYour eyes widen as she aims the shotgun at you.\n\n“Kelly, I’ll just…go…okay?” you say holding your hands up and start to back up.\n\n“Now Suzy…what sort of big sister would I be if I let you stay out there to potentially get raped, killed or eaten? You underestimate my mercy.” Kelly says with a smile and that’s when you know this is going to end badly for you.\n\nYou attempt to go for your pistol, but Kelly already has the advantage.\n\nKelly fires and a slug hit your chest, shattering bones and vital internal organs like your heart. Your lifeless body flies backwards off the porch and onto the concrete walkway.\n",
  "page 288": "You can’t do it. Even if you could pull it off and ignore the immorality of it, you still can’t do it. If you did, you’d be taking the easy way out just in a different fashion.\n\nBesides, what right do you have to take this good life away from this reality’s Suzy? You don’t.\n\n“No! We wouldn’t dream of making you do such a thing! You come right over, and we’ll answer the door when you arrive.” You say.\n“You sure?”\n“Of course I’m sure! What kind of parents would we be if we didn’t let our own daughter back into the house?”\n“You two really are the greatest parents sometimes. What am I saying? You two are the greatest parents ALL the time! Okay, well I guess I’ll be seeing you tonight then.”\n“Suzy?” you utter.\n“Yeah?” she asks.\n“I want you to know that your father and I love you very much.”\n“I know that mom. I love you guys too.”\n“Just always remember that, okay? We’ll see you when you get here.” You say before hanging up.\n\nYou have to fight back the urge to cry.\n\n“Did I hear you on the phone out here?” you mother says walking into the kitchen.\n“Huh? Oh, yeah just someone trying to sell something. They were really persistent.” You reply.\n“I can tell, you hardly cut up any of the carrots.”\n“Sorry, I guess I got caught up in telling them to never call here again. I should have just hung up I suppose.”\n“No worries, I’ve gotten directly angry at those telemarketer types too.”\n“Hey mom, I’ve got some things I left here that I want to get and I know they’re probably in my room somewhere, you don’t mind if I go take care of that do you?”\n“No, not at all. We can talk later. Let me know if you’re looking for something in particular. I might know where it is.”\n“I will mom.”\n\nYou leave the kitchen and head to your room where you close the door and break down a bit quietly. It isn’t fair, but it is the right thing to do.\n\n“Well, at least I had a few more moments with her, even if she wasn’t my real mom.” You say to yourself.\n\nAfter a few moments of being sad, you finally motivate yourself to action.\n\n“Well, I might not be killing her, but I’m not above stealing from the bitch.” You say and grab an old looking duffle bag out of her closet and grab a bunch of her old clothes out of her drawers for yourself.\n\nSure they’re going to be a little tight, but at least you won’t have spend money on clothes for awhile and you’re going to have to make that thousand dollars you still have last until you figure out a way to make a living in this world.\n\nAfter pillaging your alternate’s room, you decide you probably should leave now. No point in drawing this out and it will be easier for you. You imagine that your visit here is probably going to leave some very strange questions for this family when the real Suzy arrives, but you really can’t worry about it. Besides, you’re sure that everything will work itself out anyway. Seems to have so far with this Suzy.\n\nYou head back downstairs and find that dad is back home.\n\n“Hey Suzy, where are you heading off to?” dad asks.\n“Oh, I’m just going to put this in the car and maybe drive around town. Look up some old friends and such. Might not be back until late so I might be knocking on the door waking you up again.”\n“What? You’re not even going to have dinner with us tonight? I thought the whole point of this visit was to see us!” your dad exclaims.\n“It is, but I still want to visit a few old school friends I haven’t seen in a long time too. I mean we’ll have lots of time tomorrow and the rest of the week!”\n“Rest of the week? I thought you had to leave here by Monday.”\n“Oh, yeah…well two days is still a lot of time!” you say.\n“I suppose…it’s just…well your mother and I were really happy that you arrived a little earlier than you did since we don’t see you as much anymore and we really wanted to enjoy the time we were getting with you. The extra day was like a bonus.”\n\nYou look a little downtrodden at dad’s disappointed tone.\n\n“But I guess if you made other plans with other people, I wouldn’t want to stop you.” Your dad remarks and leaves the room.\n\nYou nearly say something, but stop yourself. Instead you just head out the door and to your car.\n\nYou throw the duffle bag in the trunk of your car and get ready to drive off…\n\n“(Sigh) Shit…” you say to yourself as you hang your head down with the key just in the ignition.\n\nYou get back out of the car and head back to the house.\n\n“She’s not supposed to arrive until after midnight. Still gives me plenty of time. It’s not going to hurt to have dinner.” You say to yourself and ring the bell.\n\nThe door soon opens and dad answers.\n\n“You forget something?” he asks.\n“Yeah, my manners. You’re right, I should be spending time with you guys. Sorry dad.” You say and give him a hug.\n“It’s okay honey.” He replies and hugs you back.\n\nYou pass the next few hours chatting with dad. Mostly about mundane matters, which actually don’t involve any more insight into what your alternate life was like here. Doesn’t really matter though, you’re actually just enjoying the conversation. Back in your reality, you don’t think you ever spoke more than a half hour with your father at most.\n\nEventually when dinner is served you sit down to eat with mom too and the conversation continues. This time you do learn a little more about your “life” here and through careful weaving and quick thinking, you manage to navigate through questions you might not otherwise know the answers to.\n\nBy the time dinner is over, you’re enjoying your time with mom and dad so much that you put off leaving immediately after. Instead you play a few board games with them (Which you definitely never did as a child with either of them in your own reality) and continue to have more fun.\n\nEventually the time is getting very late and you do start to get concerned that the other Suzy will arrive earlier than expected. Fortunately mom and dad being creatures of habit tell you they’re turning in for the night and after a few more words, hugs goodnight and mentions of plans for tomorrow, they go to bed.\n\nYou look at the time and see it’s indeed getting up for midnight. You leave the house and get in your car once again.\n\nAs you drive off, you notice you aren’t sad. Well you’re sad that you do have to leave, but you not the emotional wreck you thought you might be. Maybe that little extra time together brought closure of sorts. You certainly are more at peace with it all. You wipe a few tears from your eyes and smile.\n\nThis moment of “zen” is suddenly cut short by a car slamming into your driver’s side while rolling through a stop sign due to neither you nor the other driver paying full attention to your surroundings.\n\nThe impact is pretty hard and given you weren’t even wearing your seatbelt at the time makes it worse. Unlike the car crash you had this earlier week, you’re hurt very badly and you even can’t move in your current condition. As you’re lying in your car bleeding, bones broken, having a hard time breathing drifting in and out of consciousness and a piece of twisted metal impaling your side you don’t think a mysterious stranger with magical healing gel is going to fix you this time.\n\nYou also can’t help but think that this is probably the only way this week could have ended for you. Part of you wants to fight, but somehow with the last few good moments you just had with mom and dad make you actually want to let go. Why keep struggling? If you live you live, if not, well at least you had some joy during your last day. More than you might have had otherwise. Maybe you just weren’t meant for this world either.\n\nYou aren’t sure how long you lay twisted in the wrecked vehicle for before you hear sirens, but you aren’t even awake long enough to hear the ambulance sirens, let alone before anyone actually comes and helps you. You die of your wounds in the ambulance thanks to the paramedics attending to the other driver first. Who are more than a little freaked out when they first see you and the driver of the other car.\n\nThe funny thing is, you never did see that it was a silver sports car that slammed into you. Somehow fitting that this reality’s Suzy was luckier than you.\n",
  "page 166": "If you’re going to risk your life, it might as well be worth it and you’re not seeing a carnival as being worth it.\n\n“I’m more than willing to be a productive member of this community, and far be it from me to question your orders Mel, but I don’t think the carnival is the right way to go. Assuming the carnies didn’t already pull up stakes and assuming the military even bothered to send a detachment to a carnival, I can’t believe that the detachment would’ve been any better supplied than the one sent here.”\n“So what are you saying exactly, blondie?”\n“I’m saying that it would be a better plan to go back into town. I know my area alone has a couple of pharmacies and even a grocery store. I could easily direct you to them.”\n“Town? That was a clusterfuck the last time we tried that! Besides, how do we know those places haven’t already been looted?”\n“It’s a risk, but I believe if you want a better chance at getting medicine and medical supplies, it would be better bet to go back into town. You’re better equipped and prepared for what to expect in town now too. It’s up to you though, you’re in charge after all.” You say.\n\nMel looks at you and then looks at Tina.\n\n“Don’t look at me. I voted to shoot them.” Tina remarks.\n“Yeah, yeah, you’re never fuckin’ supportive. (Sigh) Fuck it. You make a good point blondie. We’ll head back into town, nobody’s gonna like it, but like I said, fuck it. You go head over to the entrance, I’ll be over there soon.”\n\nAs you’re about to go over to the trucks by the entrance, Tina grabs a hold of your arm with a semi-forceful grip. You spin around and see that her face isn’t one of friendliness.\n\n“So, you managed to change Mel’s mind. Pretty impressive. I have a hard time doing that at the best of times. Maybe he is fuckin’ ya.” Tina says.\n“What?! Tina I swear I’m not doing anything with Mel!” you exclaim.\n“Oh no, I don’t think you are, but you’re not exactly adverse to usin’ yer natural attractiveness to get yer way. Yer doin’ it to keep the rest of the slugs off of ya. I get it, but if Mel does some fool thing because it was his idea, I can handle that. He does it on a regular basis. Hell, if he does some fool thing cause one of his drinkin’ buddies thought it was a good idea, I can handle that as well since it doesn’t even happen that often and he usually realizes it before it gets too out of hand. However, Mel goin’ to do some fool thing because some tease fluttered her eyes at him is something else entirely.\n“Tina, I…”\n“Shut the fuck up blondie, fore I pull that pretty golden hair from your head by the roots. Now listen to me close, this is the LAST time you EVER influence Mel to do something ever again. Got it?”\n\nWhile you’ve certainly “toughened up” this week and Tina’s actually shorter than you, but even now you doubt that you’d be able to physically take a trailer park girl like her that’s probably gotten into more fist fights than the number of years you’ve been alive.\n\n“Got it.” You meekly say.\n\nTina doesn’t even acknowledge your compliance; she just shoulder shoves you out of the way when she heads back to her trailer.\n\nWith that unpleasantness out of the way, you head over to the trucks. When you arrive at your destination, a group of rednecks are already there checking various rifles and handguns. It really does look like they got enough to take on an army.\n\n“Well now if it isn’t blondie. I’m surprised Mel is riskin’ his piece on the side like this.” One of the sleazier rednecks says.\n“I know that’s right Ray. If she was mine, I’d be wantin’ to keep her safe.” Another says.\n“Piece on the side? Is that what Mel told all of you?” you ask which is followed by a lot of snickering.\n\n“Not in so many words honey, but we ain’t the idiots that he thinks we are. Why else would he tell us to lay off of ya if he wasn’t stickin’ ya? Sonofabitch already has Tina, don’t see why he gets ta have TWO fine pieces of ass while some of us ain’t got none.” Ray remarks.\n“Nothing is going on between Mel and I.” you say.\n“Oh? Is that right blondie? Well how about you get something going on right HERE!” Ray remarks while grabbing his crotch causing everyone to laugh.\n“Sorry, I’m not a lesbian and I don’t eat pussy.” You remark dryly.\n\nYour insult doesn’t quite sink in immediately, though Ray gets the idea he has been insulted.\n\n“What the hell’s that mean?” Ray demands.\n“It means she doesn’t think you got a dick and that you ain’t a man. Something we all knew a long time ago Ray, not stop givin’ the girl grief and hand her a pistol.” Mel suddenly says as he walks up with a few more people behind him.\n\nAfter Ray grudgingly hands you a pistol and then Mel breaks the bad news to everyone that they’re heading back into town. There is predictably a lot of protesting and grumbling, but after shouting everyone down everyone complies with Mel’s orders. Everyone gets in their vehicles and you ride up front in Mel’s pick up truck.\n\nAs the trucks pull out from the trailer park, Mel fiddles with the radio, but he doesn’t get anything except Ground Zero ads.\n\n“Goddamn Ground Zero shit. I’m tellin’ you like I’ve said to everyone else, it’s a fuckin’ conspiracy goin’ on with them. In fact all of this shit goin’ on is government related.” Mel says turning off the radio.\n\nThe rest of your drive to town is mostly a quiet one. Mel doesn’t bother speaking to you and you’re a little too pre-occupied by what you’re going to do about your current situation because between the incident with Tina and the one with Ray you can’t help but think that you’re never going to fit in or be comfortable there. Your sister might’ve just ditched you, but you’re starting to think she had the right idea about leaving.\n\nWhen you do finally get to town it’s predictably a warzone. A war in which it appears the military did NOT win. You see overturned vehicles, dead bodies and destruction, but there is no semblance of organized order anywhere.\n\nThe only thing that is “organized” are the cannibal freaks and there are large groups of them roving the streets or already feasting on the dead. They naturally start attacking whenever your group drives through an infested area. Shooting and running them over becomes the order of the day as you direct Mel to the best way to get to your own neighborhood area.\n\nWhen you finally do get to your area, the number of freaks severely decreases. It’s sort of odd, but where you lived seems relatively safe. There are still signs of devastation here and there are certainly dead bodies to be seen, but so far it’s a lot safer than the rest of the town.\n\n“Guess the military cleaned up this area, before they got their asses kicked. How much further is our destination?” Mel asks.\n“Just make a left up here and you’ll be there.” You remark.\n\nFollowing your directions Mel makes a turn and then pulls into the parking lot of what looks to be a completely deserted pharmacy with a few broken windows. The other two trucks park nearby. The pharmacy across the street looks deserted as well. No telling what’s inside either of them, but you sort of get the impression the noise of the vehicles would’ve attracted freak attention if any were lurking about.\n\n“Where’s the grocery store?” Mel asks.\n“That’s a few blocks up the street.” You reply.\n“Okay guess it’s time to tell everyone the next phase of this plan.”\n\nMel gets out of the truck and calls attention to everyone.\n\n“Alright, we got three locations to search, which is good because there are three big groups of us. I’m gonna search this pharmacy. Ray, you go search the one across the street. Dan, your group can get back in your truck and search the grocery store up the block.” Mel says.\n“What? Aw Mel, why I gotta drive all that way?”\n“Goddamnit Dan it ain’t that fuckin’ far! Just fuckin’ do it! Besides, I know you. If you’re searching one of these pharmacies, your junkies ass is gonna pocket all the med for yourself and claim you didn’t find anything.”\n\nWhile Dan is in the middle of protesting, you’re coming to the conclusion of your earlier thoughts on the ride over here. Namely, you’re tired of this group and you’re going to risk going it alone. You figure you’re already close to your house, you could probably sneak away and head there for temporary relief to plan your next move. Though if you went with Dan you’d be even closer to your home.\n\nWhen Mel finishes ordering everyone about, you go up to talk to him.\n\n“Hey Mel, I think I should go with Dan.”\n“Huh? What the fuck you wanna go with that junkie asshole for?”\n“Well grocery stores do tend to carry a small supply of medicine too, I figure I can keep an eye on him if he decides to not be in a sharing mood.”\n“Hmm, good point blondie…hey Dan! Don’t go yet, blondie’s comin’ with ya so make room in the front!” Mel shouts before Dan pulls away.\n\nYou hop into Dan’s truck and you’re soon on your way though Dan’s attention is half on the road and half on you.\n\n“Sort of surprised you wanted to come with me blondie.” He says scratching himself.\n“Well, Mel doesn’t entirely trust you. He thinks if you find any medicine in the grocery store, you’ll just keep it for yourself. So he’s sent me to keep an eye on you.”\n“Oh.” Dan says.\n“Don’t worry Dan, I’m not gonna rat you out if you take some things for personal use. I know it’s not really your fault and that you’re just sick.” You say in an empathetic tone.\n\nDan smiles at you revealing his horrible dental conditions.\n\n“See that’s what I’ve told people before! I’m glad you understand darlin’. I mean I’ve really tried to quit before, but…”\n\nAt this point Dan goes on with his pathetic sob story about how he’s tried to kick his drug habit, but you’re not really listening. Your thoughts of escaping these ignorant redneck assholes are filling your mind.\n\nWhen you get to your destination, the grocery store is in much the same condition as the pharmacies were. Dan, you and the rest get out of the vehicle.\n\n“Seems like this place could be clear, but keep alert anyway. Could be somethin’ as big as a Butchie Billie, or it could be as small as Wade’s dick!” Dan laughs causing Wade to swear at Dan and others to chuckle.\n\nStill set on your plan of escape, you think about how you’re going to do it. The easiest way would be to just sneak away at the earliest opportunity and run home. You’re fairly confident you could do it.\n\nOf course you’re also wondering if you shouldn’t just get away from these assholes, but the whole forsaken town in general. Staying here even in the “safety” of your home still isn’t going to eliminate the problem that you’re going to be located in cannibal central.\n\nOf course if you want to leave town the safest way to do that is by vehicle which means you’re going to have to engage in the riskier endeavor of stealing Dan’s keys.\n",
  "page 287": "If you’re going to do this, it’s better that you do it away from the house. There is exactly one motel in this town anyway so it’ll be real easy to find her.\n\n“I’m sorry dear, but your father has been a bit jumpy lately due to a recent string of burglaries. I wouldn’t want him suddenly pulling a shotgun on you just because you’re knocking on the door in the middle of the night. Nevermind the fact he’ll be pretty grumpy anyway. He hasn’t been sleeping well as you might expect.” You answer.\n“Yikes! Well I guess maybe I should stay at the motel then, I don’t want to cause grief. The Jinn Inn is still open right?” she says.\n“Yep, as far as I know.” You answer.\n“Okay, guess I’m staying there. Ugh, just hate the idea of staying there due to it being so dirty looking. It’s like one step up from that awful trailer park outside of town. I dunno how that place has stayed open so long.”\n“Well the hookers in town need to ply their trade somewhere.”\n“Mom! I’ve never heard you talk like that before!” She exclaims.\n“Well I’m not a prude dear, despite what you might think of me.”\n“Mom, I don’t think you’re a prude. I know you’re very open-minded. You’re just usually pretty reserved with how your talk.”\n“Well I’m full of surprises, just like you are. Where do you think you got it from?”\n“Hah, guess you’re right. Okay then, I suppose I shouldn’t really talk so much while I drive. I guess I’ll be seeing you on Saturday after all. Give my love to dad.”\n“I will dear.”\n“I love you mom.”\n“I love you too Suzy.” You say before hanging up.\n\nYou don’t have much time, you have to prepare and make a plan of what you’re going to do.\n\n“Did I hear you on the phone out here?” you mother says walking into the kitchen.\n“Huh? Oh, yeah just someone trying to sell something. They were really persistent.” You reply.\n“I can tell, you hardly cut up any of the carrots.”\n“Sorry, I guess I got caught up in telling them to never call here again. I should have just hung up I suppose.”\n“No worries, I’ve gotten directly angry at those telemarketer types too.”\n“Hey mom, I’ve got some things I left here that I want to get and I know they’re probably in my room somewhere or maybe even the basement, you don’t mind if I go take care of that do you?”\n“No, not at all. We can talk later. Let me know if you’re looking for something in particular. I might know where it is.”\n“I will mom.”\n\nYou head to your room to try to formulate a plan. You figure the easiest way to do this is to hang out near or around the motel parking lot and watch for a silver sports car. When you see what room she goes to, you can just blitz attack her as she’s attempting to open it up and take care of her in the motel room itself. You just need to be quick.\n\nSo, now that you have her, now you have to kill her. You’re going to need something quick and not noisy. A knife you suppose, but that might take more than one stab unless you cut her throat or something. The bat you got from the Gray Building might work, if you smash her in the head multiple times. The thing is you don’t want is to splatter a bunch of blood all over the place. The Jinn Inn might be shady and dirty enough that a few blood spots on their carpets aren’t going to raise an eyebrow, but if you make it look like the chainsaw massacre, you will cause attention and it isn’t like you’re going to have all the time in the world to clean it up. The goal is to make the kill and replace her as efficiently as possible.\n\nWhich brings you to the idea of how you’re going to dispose of the body since you can’t just leave a dead doppelganger of yourself in the motel room. You’re definitely going to have to haul it out into the wilderness-surrounding town. Dragging it to one of the trunks of the car is going to be the most difficult part. (You still aren’t sure which one you’ll take) Dragging her body out might be less risky if you at least wrapped it in something; you think you saw some things in the basement that might come in useful.\n\nOnce you get the body into the trunk though, you just need to drive far enough away so it isn’t discovered. Even if it is, maybe you should mutilate the face so it can’t be identified. Pull out the teeth?\n\nYour murder plans are temporarily broken up by your thoughts of Bobby. You didn’t often speak to Bobby about his “religious practices”, but in the few times you dared to ask questions, he did explain helpfully about how he went about things. You never dreamed that such knowledge might come in handy.\n\nYou make a mental note of everything you might need. You grab an old duffle bag out of the closet and fill it with some of her old clothing from her drawers. You figure you’re probably going to need new clothing to wear after your grim work.\n\nWhen you head downstairs you find that dad has returned.\n\n“Hey Suzy, where are you off to?”\n“Oh just putting some stuff of mine in the car, hey dad I was thinking about painting my place when I get back home. I noticed some old tarps and blankets in the basement, you wouldn’t mind if I took those would you?” you ask.\n“Oh no, go ahead. Take whatever you might need.” He says.\n\nYou head to your car and throw the duffle bag in, then you return to the house and head down into the basement.\n\nYou grab some of the folded up tarps and then you notice some of the old tools and other junk down here. Are you going to need an axe to chop up the body? Maybe you should take a shovel to bury it in the wilderness? You remember they stuffed a body into a luggage case in one movie…\n\n“Fuck it, I’m still not sure what I’m going to do, I better just take all this shit. Dad did say to help myself.” You say and make a couple trips up and down the basement, loading up your car with tools, tape, bags, and tarps in the process. (And being to keep the shovel and axe hidden within the tarps since the last thing you need is a question about why you might need those)\n\nBy the time you’re done, you’re about ready to go do the deed right now, but it’s still too early. Besides, you can’t just disappear for all day and night, your parents would wonder. You’re going to have to come up with an excuse of why you’re going to be gone.\n\nAs you’re piecing together an excuse, when you get back in the house your mom sees and addresses you again.\n\n“You going to have dinner with us in a half hour or so?” she asks.\n“…yes…of course. I have to leave though afterwards.”\n“Leave? You just got here!”\n“I don’t mean leave to go back to Security City, I just mean…well I’ve been in contact with a former school friend through the Internet and she’s sort of been going through some tough times. I promised I’d meet up with her when I was visiting.”\n“Oh…well I certainly understand. Who was this friend? Do I know her? Though I suppose I only ever remember Julie due to you two hanging together a lot.”\n\nYou very briefly blank on making up a name on the spot, however you do come up with one rather quickly.\n\n“Um, Diana. Her name was Diana Morningstar. She never came over here, since her parents were always a bit strict, but I always got along with her in school. She wasn’t very popular, but I always felt a bit sorry for her so I was sort of her only real friend. Though I imagine she probably put more stock into it than I did, I mean I was still just a shallow kid at the time and wanted to hang out with Julie since we could have fun together like normal young teens. I sort of lost contact with her when her parents pulled her out of school altogether and home schooled her. I think they were religious nuts.”\n\nYour mother just shakes her head.\n\n“See, parents like that just shouldn’t have children. That’s a shame. Well I’m glad to hear that you showed that girl a bit of kindness. I’m sure she’s glad you’re in contact again and will be happy to see you. You always were thoughtful.” Your mother says and then mentions that you should take a spare key for the house from the desk in the front room just in case you come home late and they’re already asleep.\n\nEventually it’s dinnertime and you have dinner with your mom and dad. Through a bit of conversation you do learn a little more about your “life” here and through careful weaving and quick thinking, you manage to navigate through questions you might not otherwise know the answers to. To be honest though, you’re only just barely paying attention to any of it, because you’re so preoccupied.\n\nWhile you’re apparently calm on the outside, you’re really a ball of nervous energy and as soon as dinner is over you nearly rush out of the house, though you do grab the spare house key for appearances.\n\nYou say goodbye to your parents and leave the house. It’s night, but it’s still too early for her to be at the motel yet, well at least you hope that’s the case since that will change up your plans of how to get to her.\n\nYou spend a bit of time driving around trying to put yourself in the mind frame to do this. You can’t afford to choke; this is a life or death decision quite literally. You need to do this for your future life here. The life that you deserved…but why are you so much more deserving? Didn’t this Suzy work hard to get what she got even if she had a few advantages? Are you just too overwhelmed with jealousy? How can you genuinely desire to find the inner strength to kill?\n\n“For fuck’s sake Suzy, you were going out with a cultist for fuck’s sake and you had no problem with him killing people! Is this really all that surprising?” you exclaim to yourself.\n\nMaybe this is genetic. Maybe you take after Uncle Ed. (Who you learned didn’t exist in this reality when your mom mentioned being an only child at dinner) Maybe it was your fucked up upbringing. Maybe it was your environment. Maybe there was always darkness in you and you were just too damn lazy for it ever to fully thrive.\n\nWell it’s thriving now. Is it ever. You’ve got more motivation than you ever have before. Maybe it’s because there is so much at stake. Maybe it’s because on some level you actually hate yourself and by killing this Suzy, well it’s like killing yourself without the actual downside of dying.\n\nWhatever the reason, you can’t waste anymore time thinking about whether this is right or wrong. Your life hasn’t exactly been “right” for a very long time, but if everything goes according to plan, your life will be getting there.\n\nWell at least that’s how you’re convincing yourself this time around. Just like you’ve convinced yourself of several other things this week, you succeed in convincing yourself of this too. It’s getting a lot easier.\n\nYou stop driving around town and finally head to the motel. You’ll wait the rest of the time out in the parking lot.\n\nWhen you get to the Jinn Inn, it isn’t quite as bad as the one in your reality, but you definitely see some shady characters popping into the rooms. You see no sign of a silver sports car though and you do take the time to check. She’s not here yet so you just park in a strategic location where you can see all the traffic coming in and out. When she arrives, you’ll definitely see her.\n\nHours pass, but you never lose focus. And eventually your vigilance pays off. You see a silver sports car. It actually isn’t as fancy as you thought it might be, probably was bought used, but it’s certainly more than you ever had.\n\nYou watch her park close to the motel rooms and then you see her get out of the car. She’s dressed in casual clothing and carries a small purse, but when you watch her walk to the motel check in office, you notice she carries herself with an air of self-confidence. It’s like it doesn’t matter that the area she’s around is shit, she knows she’s better and isn’t at all intimidated by the element here.\n\nIt is at this moment you grab your baseball bat and get out of the car still keeping an eye out and crouching down behind the vehicles. Fortunately nobody else happens to be lingering around the lot at the moment. Hopefully it stays that way.\n\nYou soon see her come out of the check in office and as stealthily as you can you run over behind more cars and get closer. You watch where she walks to and continue to keep a look out for anyone else that might suddenly pop up. You just need to stay hidden as you follow her and then rush her when she finally opens up her room. You silently thank your luck for once since she seems to not be very aware of her surroundings and only focuses on heading towards her room.\n\n“Stupid, arrogant bitch…” you say to yourself.\n\nYour stalking soon ends when you see her reach her room. It’s a perfect opening too. Nobody is around and she fumbles with the keys a bit giving you time to get closer before making that mad sprint as soon as she opens her room… and then you strike.\n\nYour target opens the door and enters her room. She turns around to close the door just in time to see you up close in front of her hitting her with face with the bat. It isn’t a full swing, but rather a hard “poke”, but it’s enough to break her nose and cause her to go falling to the floor.\n\nYou quickly slam the door shut behind you and you briefly think about beating her brains in with the bat, but then you realize that will probably be messy.\n\n“You…” is all she manages to get out before you kick her in the face to shut her up. Then you pounce on top of her and after turning her over, you use the bat sideways and you press it up against her throat as hard as you can as you pull back.\n\nShe gasps and struggles for her life, but it’s no use, your determination to kill her is much stronger than her abilities to fight for her life.\n\n“Shhhhh…just let go….just let go…everything is going to work out and your parents won’t be losing a daughter at all. Just let go….” You whisper.\n\nSoon you hear a crunching sound of perhaps crushing bones in her neck or her windpipe or something. Whatever it is, her struggle temporarily becomes more violent and jerky with her limbs attempting to flail about. It almost feels like you’re riding her like a wild pony, but soon this outburst is muted and then nothing.\n\nSuzy collapses dying with her face partially in a small puddle of her blood and spital, leaving you sitting on top of a corpse’s back. You eventually stand up taking in what you’ve done. You’re hot and sweaty, but strangely invigorated.\n\n“(Whew) And I thought I was going to choke.” you say and then start to chuckle at your own dark joke.\n\nWell the first part of the deed is done, now comes the more labor inducing part. Getting rid of her body.\n\nYou’ve actually managed to keep the mess to a minimum by choking her to death, so you’re wondering if you shouldn’t just grab the tarps from the car, roll her ass up in them, duct tape it together and take her to the trunk.\n\nShe might be your size, (Okay slightly lighter) but it isn’t like you’re used to carrying bodies around. While there wasn’t anyone out there, the last thing you need is someone seeing you fumbling around with a body, even one wrapped in a tarp.\n\nIf you wanted to play it safe, you suppose you could drag her to the bathroom and chop her up in the bathtub. It will definitely take longer and you might make more of a mess, but you could always carry her out in several pieces in that big luggage bag you brought with you.\n",
  "page 169": "If you’re going to escape, you might as well escape it all. You can worry about what comes after later.\n\nYou already got an idea of how to get the truck keys from Dan, but it’s not something you’re looking forward to…\n\nMustering up your mental fortitude you prepare yourself for the unpleasant task ahead.\n\nYour group goes into the grocery store, which must still have on some sort of emergency lighting where upon everyone begins to carefully search the place. While there has been some looting and even signs of fighting that went on here, the place is in better shape than anyone thought.\n\n“Hey Dan, the medicine aisle is over this way.” You say while gently grabbing his hand. Dan is more than a little surprised by this gesture.\n“Oh. Okay, lead the way then. Everyone else keep stockin’ up on whatever food you want. ” He responds.\nWhen you lead Dan over to the aisle you remind yourself of what your goal is…\n“Damn darlin’ it looks like this aisle is mgh!” Dan is interrupted when you kiss him directly on his meth rotten mouth. It tastes horrible and it’s only due to your strong gag reflex that you don’t puke.\n\nDan is flabbergasted; he literally is at a loss for words.\n\n“I gotta suck your dick right now Dan. It’s all I’ve been thinking about since we were ridin’ in the truck together. Shit, I woulda went down on you right then had there not been an audience in the back of the truck. Come on we can go into the bathroom of this place.” You whisper in his ear.\nDan is still tongue tied, but at this point he’s not arguing and passively follows you as you lead him to the women’s bathroom in the back of the store. You make sure nobody has seen the pair of you enter and then lock the door.\n“I…I…I can’t believe you felt this way about me darlin’. I mean this is gotta be a dream.” Dan says.\n“Ain’t no dream, now back against that wall, pull ‘em down and let me get to suckin’ what’s gotta be a big ass dick. Gotta have it. Gotta have that juicy hot throbbing cock in my mouth.” You say.\n\nDan’s fantasies of an insatiable cock hungry hot blonde have probably been fueled for years by endless amounts of porn he’s no doubt watched. So it’s predictable that he doesn’t even question the unlikelihood of any of this at all.\n\nHe wastes no time in putting down his rifle and unzipping his pant. It’s an unimpressive sight. It’s even more unimpressive when you’re on your knees, eye level to it.\n\n“Oh my god, this is gonna be better than drugs!” Dan says even closing his eyes as if preparing himself for the glory that is your mouth.\n\nUnfortunately for him he gets none of that and instead receives a FALCON PUNCH to his balls.\n\nDan’s reaction causes him to practically crumple onto you. He manages to wheeze a few swear, but you then shut him up by smacking his head against the bathroom wall, he groans a bit and still tries to grab a hold of you, but you stop him completely by pistol whipping him in the face until he’s no longer moving.\n\nYou aren’t sure if he’s dead, but you’re not really paying attention to see if he’s breathing by this point, you’re too busy looking for the keys…jackpot.\nThen you hear some banging on the door and you freeze with your pistol in hand.\n\n“Hey, who’s in there? I heard some noise. Is that you blondie?” you hear a voice exclaim.\n“…uh yeah it’s me! I had to take a shit and there were just some big ass rats in here that scared me so bad I almost dropped a load in my pants! No big deal though!” you shout.\n“Oh…um okay.” The voice says. “Um, hey you seen Dan?”\n“Thought I saw him still over by the drug aisle.” “Yeah he’s not…” the voice starts to say before you interrupt.\n“Goddamn it I’m trying to take a shit that feels like I need a goddamn midwife for this thing! I’m not Dan’s personal fucking shadow, go look for him yourself!” you shout.\n“Okay! Okay! Sheesh, you don’t need to be a goddamn bitch about it.” The voice says and then you hear some footsteps leaving.\n\nWell that will have bought you a little time, but when you leave, you need to make a beeline for the truck and hope that nobody is lingering around it at the time. Since you get the impression you’re going to be shooting it out with the rednecks anyway, you take Dan’s rifle over your shoulder.\n\nYou exit the bathroom and look around to see a few of the rednecks still stocking up on some more food. You quicken your pace towards the entrance of the grocery store while attempting to keep your head down so nobody immediately sees you.\n\nWhen you get to the entrance there’s one of the rednecks loading up something in the back of the truck. You think its Wade from earlier.\n\n“Everything come out all right?” he asks meaning he must’ve been the one talking to you from outside the door earlier.\n“Yeah, yeah.” you say looking around if there are any others you need to deal with.\n“Y’know, maybe you wouldn’t be so backed up if you tried anal.” Wade says with a smirk.\n“Excuse me?”\n“Ass fuckin’, sweetcheeks. It’ll loosen you up back there. I’d be more than willin’ to help you out in that department honey.” Wade says with a grin.\n\nAnd at that point, you’re done with stealth.\n\n“And here’s a new hole to loosen up your useless brain matter shithead.” You say pulling your pistol blasting Wade in the head. You don’t wait for the body to fall, you run into the truck.\n\nYou get the truck started and you already hear the shouting and sounds of the rest from the grocery store. These sounds are soon followed by the sounds of bullets hitting your truck as you drive off. You keep your head down as much as possible as the back window is blown out and several sounds of bullets hitting the metal parts of the truck. While you’re glad none of them had the forethought to aim for your back tires, you just hope nobody hit the gas tank.\n\nYour drive through your war-torn town is pretty stressful. Between trying avoid large groups of freaks and abandoned military blockades you are also constantly looking in your rear mirror thinking that you’re going to see Mel’s truck and the rest in pursuit, but that doesn’t happen. You don’t really relax a bit until you manage to get out of town.\n\n“Holy shit, I made it. Fuck yeah I made it!” you shout in triumph as you continue to drive eastward.\n\nYou continue to drive for quite sometime. Maybe its because you never really left your basement, but you never really realized what a rural area you lived in before, a lot of wilderness on either side of you. The roads are pretty clear of traffic; you don’t see anyone else driving in the opposite direction or your direction for that matter. You do see a few abandoned vehicles, but nobody around them. You don’t even see any of the cannibal freaks. Maybe that’s a good sign.\n\nYou pass by a few gas stations, diners and the like and while you do think you notice evidence that there are probably folks at these locations, you’re not exactly in a trusting mood right now and quite frankly you don’t want to deal with anyone. If anything you’re sort of enjoying the solitude that you haven’t had for a few days.\n\nSoon, the day starts to become night and you’re getting pretty tired. You have had a long day of escaping cannibal freaks and rednecks after all. You pull off to the side of the road near the edge of a “wall of trees.”\n\nYou clear off the broken glass from the seat of the truck and lay down to get some sleep, hoping that something doesn’t try to attack you in the middle of the night.\n",
  "page 170": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a noise in the distance. At first you think it’s something trying to cause you harm and you sit up with pistol in hand, but then you realize there isn’t anything near you.\n\nHowever upon looking around you do notice something in the sky when even with your half sleepy eyes.\n\nYou step out of the truck and stare towards the westward sky in the distance and see the remnants of a mushroom cloud.\n\n“They finally went and did it…” you say to yourself.\n\nYou guess that it might’ve hit Security City (Good thing you drove east). Who and why it was dropped is unimportant at this point, but you’re not really surprised given how things seemed to be going to shit here and the world in general.\n\nProbably was a small one, since you’re not feeling any aftershocks or anything, but you are somewhat concerned if you’re within a lethal radiation zone. You suppose you’ll find out in the days to come, but that leads you to your more immediate concern of survival, namely you’re hungry and thirsty.\n\nYou check what those rednecks managed to load up on the back of the truck and hope that not all of it needs a can opener.\n\nYou see that a lot of it is cans, but fortunately some of them already have ring pulls on them. Other cans have suffered damage from the bullets that went through them. You suppose if you got desperate you could always suck out the remaining soup through the bullet holes.\n\nYou do find a couple bags of beef jerky, which is as quick of a meal as anything. You look to see if they loaded up anything to drink, but all you’re finding is cheap beer. You’ve actually never drank alcohol before, but beggars can’t be choosers so you sit on the tailgate eating your jerky, drinking your beer and pondering your potentially grim future.\n\nWhile it’s good you have some sustenance, it’s not going to last long. Your truck only has around a half a tank of gas and the ammo you’ve got is what’s left in your respective weapons. Hell you don’t even have an extra set of clothes anymore.\n\nYou have no idea where you’re going to go. You suppose continuing east might be your best bet, but. this isn’t even taking into consideration the sort of people you’re possibly going to run into and if those infected freaks aren’t running around elsewhere.\n\nWith all these variables weighing on your mind, things aren’t looking so good right now…\n\n“Hey! Hey miss! Did you hear a loud noise?” a voice shouts.\n\nYou spin your head to your left with your hand instinctively reaching behind you to pull your pistol, but you see a male and female couple probably a little younger than yourself wearing large backpacks. They’ve just come out of the “wall of trees” and they don’t look threatening, but you never know. In any case they don’t seem to realize you’ve got a pistol behind you, though the fact that you’re partially covered by the pick up truck’s walls along with some bags might help.\n\n“Sure, it woke me up. Where are you coming from?” you ask.\n“Oh, we got a campsite nearby. We’ve been sort of roughin’ it for about a week. No technology like cellphones or laptops. It’s been sort of liberating in a way.”\n“Hm, yeah you never know when you might need to know how to get along without the creature comforts. Where’s you vehicle though, you couldn’t have walked all this way and I don’t see any roads leading off into the wilderness nearby.”\n“Sure there is, look in front of you a few feet away.”\n\nYou look and sure enough the man is correct, there is a little dirt road that leads into the trees. You probably didn’t notice it last night because you were tired and you didn’t notice it this morning because you were more focused on the nuke that went off in the distance.\n\n“Yeah, it doesn’t go very far in, but it was a good place to pull into so as not having to park on the side of the road. Anyway we’re going to be heading back to Security City soon, we both got classes starting on Monday.” The guy says.\n\nYou take another bite of jerky and drink of beer before breaking the unfortunate news to them.\n\n“Yeah well I don’t think that’s going to happen. That noise you heard? A nuke just got dumped on Security City.” You say flatly.\n\nAt this point the couple look at each other in disbelief.\n\n“Bullshit, that didn’t happen.” The guy says.\n“Look, you don’t need to believe me, but I’ve got no reason to lie about something like that to two complete strangers. You said you’ve been fairly isolated from the world for the past week, well there was some serious shit going down this week. I should know I had to deal with it. Trust me, if things had been different I wouldn’t be stuck out here in the middle of nowhere eating jerky and drinking beer. I’d be in the comfort of my basement.” You say.\n\nAt this point the guy still isn’t sure whether you’re telling the truth, but the girl starts to break down a bit.\n\n“Oh god…every time we tried to listen the car radio, all we got was those fucking Ground Zero shelter ads! She’s probably telling the truth! Oh shit! No!” she exclaims and begins hyperventilating.\n“Honey, calm down we don’t know…”\n\nAt this point the girl begins to cry about her friends and family while her boyfriend attempts to console her. It isn’t working.\n\n“Well look at it this way, you avoided getting nuked and you’ve probably got still got some supplies left over and you’ve got all that really useful wilderness gear right?” you say eating the last bit of jerky.\n“Huh? Yeah, look just don’t talk to us anymore.” The guy says still trying to calm his crying girlfriend.\n\nYou throw away the bag and down the remaining beer from the can.\n\n“How much gas does your vehicle have?” you ask.\n“WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?! This is a fucking nightmare!” the man says while his girlfriend continues to be weak.\n\nYou crush the can and toss it in the middle of the street. You briefly think about not doing it, but then you think this is survival.\n\n“Yeah, well it’s about to get a whole lot worse for the both of you.” You say and pull your pistol and shoot the man in the chest.\n\nHe falls to the ground and the girl now goes from crying to screaming though she’s so terrified she doesn’t attempt to run.\n\n“Bitch, stop your goddamn screaming RIGHT NOW before I shove this gun in your mouth and shoot a load so hot down your throat that it’ll be the last time you ever give head again.” You say walking towards the scared girl.\n\nYour colorful threat works and the girl just stifles her screaming to annoying whimpers. You look down at her boyfriend who is most certainly dead. You don’t feel anything about it either. You don’t feel joy, but it’s just nothing.\n\n“Okay, you’re going to take your backpack and throw it in the truck, then you’re going to take his pack and toss it in the truck too. Then we’re both heading to your campsite where I’m going to take whatever I think I’m going to need. And if you’re lucky, you might come out of this alive. Now come on.”\n\nAs you bully your new captive into doing your bidding, you think if this is how things are going to be from now on. In your mind you justify your actions as ones of survival, though you were still pretty quick to shoot her boyfriend.\n\nMaybe you’re just having a bad week and something had to give.\n\nIn any case things are starting to look up… or at least for you they are.\n",
  "page 291": "If you’re going to do this, you need to do this right. In fact the more you think about it, this isn’t going to be done in one day. However, you can get some of it done tonight if you stay focused.\n\nSure, you’re going to have to come up with a few excuses to your parents of why you were out all night, but you can think them up while you’re taking care of this.\n\nYou quickly search her body, but find nothing of interest. The purse that she dropped on the floor when you smashed her in the face contains all the important stuff, but you figure you can go through it more thoroughly later.\n\nThe first thing you do is leave the room and head directly to the check in office. When you enter you see a slovenly man watching a tv. His leering eyes turn your way and you have no doubt he thinks you’re the same woman from earlier.\n\n“Hey, I’m gonna need that room a little longer.” You say.\n“Business that good huh?” he snorts.\n“Very funny, look how much for two more days?”\n“Same price you see on the fucking sign above my head.”\n“Oh, well I guess I didn’t see it since I was so mesmerized what with you being such a stud and all.” You say sarcastically while pulling out a couple hundreds out of your pocket.\n\nYou toss the money at him dismissively, but he takes it without question.\n\n“Keep the change and I don’t want anyone disturbing me until its time to check out, got it? That means no house keeping ladies or shit knocking at my door.” You say.\n“House keeping ladies? Pfft, no problem there. I got one and she barely does her fucking job as it is. If I wasn’t married to her I would’ve fired her years ago.” The man says and returns to his show.\n\nYou then head to your car where you start bringing in several of the various objects you brought from the house. Takes you a couple trips, but you don’t have any trouble.\n\nThe motel bathroom is fortunately bigger than you expected it to be, it’s also a lot dirtier than you expected it to be. Of course now you’re not so much worried about making a mess so much as you’re afraid you’re going to catch hepatitis just being in the damn place.\n\nYou lay down tarps on the floor and in the bathtub then you drag her body in. You go grab the axe and study it a bit; hoping that it’s sharp enough that you won’t need to struggle with the whole dismemberment task.\n\nStanding over her body with an axe is a little surreal to you, but you need to stop dwelling on how weird this all is and get on with it.\n\n“Here we go.” You say and swing the axe…\n\nChopping up the body is a mixed feeling. On one hand you’re completely at peace with the deed and everything that goes along with it. The blood and gore isn’t even all that bad since you’ve gotten a bit accustomed to that, but it’s the smell that’s making you feel a little sick.\n\nYou actually have to stop chopping for a moment because you can’t stop gagging. Eventually you just give in and throw up in the toilet nearby. Afterwards, you’re more or less fine. It still isn’t nearly as bad as that fucked up reality warping tentacle monster shadow abominations you had to endure during your time in the Gray Building. You never want to experience something like that again.\n\nBy the time you’re finished, you’ve got severed parts waiting to be wrapped up. You got most of the bloody mess on the tarps, so that’s one less thing to worry about you suppose. You’ll have to dispose of the bloody clothing you’re wearing though.\n\nGetting naked, you return to your large luggage case, which you placed on the bed and open it up to retrieve all the trash bags you took along with the duct tape.\n\nThe wrapping and taping is probably more time consuming than the chopping up part. You don’t really have too many problems except when it comes to the torso which is not fun to deal with since it’s still heavy and blood is leaking everywhere from it.\n\nEventually you get everything in order and before you know it, you’ve got several body parts wrapped fairly tightly in bags and they don’t seem to be leaking either. After washing your hands and arms a bit, you grab the luggage case from the next room.\n\nIt takes some effort and squeezing, but you just barely manage to fit all of the parts in the case. After carefully moving the tarps to drain the blood in the tub, you then fold them up and squeeze them in too, along with your blood drenched clothing. The luggage case itself is made of solid material and you’re confident there won’t be any leakage, but just dragging it back into the main room takes some effort. It definitely isn’t going to be easy to shove into the car trunk.\n\nNext you spend a little time cleaning up a few places where the blood spilled on the floor or splattered on the wall. Most of this was in the bathroom and is relativity easy to get rid of, though you do spend some time scrubbing the carpet a bit where you first choked her out.\n\nAfter you’re done with all of that, you take a shower, which also gets rid of the blood already in the tub. You briefly feel a little like that infamous countess that bathed in the blood of young girls to maintain her youth.\n\nGetting dressed in a new set of clothing you brought in the duffle bag, you finally collapse on the bed not caring how filthy it may or may not be.\n\n“Ahhh…shit…” you say to yourself as fatigue sets in.\n\nYou take this opportunity to go a bit through the purse now, starting with the phone. You check the time and see that it’s practically getting up for morning.\n\nYou figure you’ll sleep here for what remains of the night and tomorrow you’ll take the remains to the wilderness and find a good spot to bury them. You imagine your mom will call you at some point, possibly even waking you up. You figure you’ll tell her you had a few drinks with Diana and you didn’t want to risk driving home. She’ll understand that even if she might not approve.\n\nYou also figure you’ll take the blue car when you drive. The shovel is still in that one and you might very well have to stop off at your parent’s house first for some reason anyway if they really make a fuss to want to see you immediately. Better you don’t have to park around the block or something just so you don’t arouse suspicion. You’ll definitely be abandoning the blue one and taking the silver one back when you leave town and head back to Security City though.\n\nAnd that’s just some of what you have to do for tomorrow. You’ll be able to do it though as long as you stay focused on your goals like you have been doing.\n\nAs you begin to drift off, your thoughts briefly focus on Bobby. Seems weird to think of him even now after all you’ve been through this week. You wonder if his family lives in town? Are they still cultists or are they normal?\n\nYou have no idea, there is going to be a lot to learn from this reality, but you can only dwell on “your” Bobby and what he might think. You certainly are a far cry from that “good girl” he rescued so long ago. He probably would be proud of you right now.\n\nYou know he’s out of your life forever now, but you still can’t help feel a little sad about it.\n\n“I still wonder if being with you influenced me or what I just did was within me all along. Either way I guess if I stayed with you earlier this week…maybe…maybe… we could have made it work after all. Another reality perhaps…” you say and close your eyes.\n",
  "page 290": "The more you think about it, chopping her up is likely just going to complicate things. Your goal is to get rid of her body as quickly as possible and really all you need to do that is drive her dead ass to the wilderness and dump it. You probably over thought this by bringing all that shit with you.\n\nNo matter, better to have it and not need it rather than the other way around.\n\nYou quickly search her body, but find nothing of interest. The purse that she dropped on the floor when you smashed her in the face contains all the important stuff, but you figure you’ll have to go through it when you have more time.\n\nYou go to the car grabbing the tape and tarps and return to the room. So far it’s still pretty quiet out there, you just hope it stays that way.\n\nYou begin rolling her up in one of the tarps and then wrap duct tape around her like mummy. You then roll her up in a second tarp, which you also tape up. It’s not exactly the neatest, but you believe you’ve got her firmly wrapped up tight.\n\nYou make the effort to clean up a little bit of the blood that was left on the motel carpet, you only got soap and water from the bathroom to work with, but it isn’t like you’re cleaning up brains and gore so you think you’re good.\n\nYou sit on the bed for a little while taking a break from your task thinking about which car you want to use. You suppose it doesn’t matter, though the sports car probably has a smaller trunk, then again you loaded up your own car with a bunch of stuff, so you’re probably going to have to rearrange stuff to make room.\n\nYou get up and using the car keys from the purse, you check out the sports car to see just how big the trunk is. After some inspection you decide that it’s probably just big enough for your purposes. It isn’t like it’s a big body after all.\n\nYou still think it might be a good idea to bury the body though, so you grab the shovel out of your car and put it in the backseat of the sports car.\n\n“Okay Suzy, let’s do this.” You say to yourself and head back inside to get her body.\n\nYou pick up the body and it really isn’t easy. It isn’t like you’re literally carrying “your own weight” on a regular basis, not to mention a dead body is somewhat awkward to attempt to carry even if you do have it wrapped tight.\n\nYou get to the trunk of the sports car and start swearing when the body’s weight begins to take its toll and you even up dropping it on the cement before you can even attempt to get it into the trunk.\n\n“Shit!” you exclaim and then quickly look around to see if anyone is watching or around. You’re still in luck that nobody is around. (You guess the hookers are really busy with their tricks tonight)\n\nWith some effort, you manage to pick the body back up and cram it into the trunk. Cram is definitely the correct word since you miscalculated and the trunk was slightly smaller than your thought. You actually have to lift your leg to stomp the body into the trunk before you can close it properly.\n\nWhen you’re done with that, you go back into the room to make sure you haven’t forgotten anything and grab her purse before you leave.\n\nAs you start up the car and leave you figure you’ll drive north of town, drag her into the woods, find a good spot and start digging a hole. You have no idea how long that’s all going to take, but you imagine you’ll have to come up with another excuse for your parents about why you were out all night. You figure you’ll just make up something about Diana again. Never thought that bitch would come in so handy.\n\nYou also figure you’ll have to come back for your own car as well since it will look pretty strange coming back home with the silver one. You suppose when you finally stop “visiting” your parents you can always come back for the silver one and just abandon this one.\n\nIt’s all a lot to deal with still, and you’re already partially frustrated and tired from all the dead body lifting.\n\nThanks to this fatigue and the sports car going slightly faster than when you were driving the other one, you end up going past the designated speed limit in the area and misfortune strikes, you attract the attention of a hidden police vehicle. The sirens and blinking lights soon follow.\n\nYou curse loudly and briefly think about just speeding up and getting the hell out of town, but you instead remain calm. You have this Suzy’s ID and everything so as long as you don’t act suspicious, you’ll probably be fine. In fact, knowing the cops in this town, all you’ll have to do is flutter your eye lashes at them a bit and you’ll probably get let go with just a warning.\n\nYou slow down and pull over.\n\n“Keep your head Suzy, you’re in the home stretch…” you say closing your eyes and trying to maintain your cool.\n\nA tall and bulky cop soon comes out of the car and walks over to you. At first you figure it’s going to be a guy, but then your heart sinks when you see who it really is.\n\n“Well, well, well, if it isn’t baby sister.” Kelly remarks.\n“Fuck.” You inadvertently exclaim, losing whatever composure you were attempting to have.\n“Fuck? Now is that anyway to greet your big sister? I heard you were in town visiting mom and dad. What are you doing out so late breaking traffic laws?”\n“I’m just coming back from an old friend’s house okay? And I wasn’t that much over the speed limit.”\n“Rules are rules Suzy, but then you always DID think there was a separate set of rules for you didn’t you? Yeah, always the favorite getting your own way…”\n\nYou can’t believe this. Even in this reality, Kelly is still a fucking jealous bullying asshole to you. Some things never change.\n\nKelly notices you’re looking a little annoyed and anxious by her stop.\n\n“What’s wrong Suzy? No pithy come back college girl?” Kelly asks.\n“Look, you win Kelly, you got me. I obviously broke the law and you got me. Just write me the damn ticket already.” You remark.\n“Not sure if I like your tone sis…in fact you’re acting a little odd. What old friend might have you been visiting anyway in this town? Figured when you moved away you were glad to leave everyone behind. Not to mention the only person I ever remember you hanging out with was Julie and I hear you’re not on speaking terms anymore.”\n“Just some girl from school days I’ve had contact with over the Internet. I promised I would visit her. I’m just on my way back to mom and dad’s.”\n“Ohhh, girl huh? This wouldn’t be some midnight booty call for you would it? Some old secret labia-licking friend you had when you were still in the closet? I thought you had a steady girlfriend. Guess more rules that you don’t give a shit about.”\n\nYou know you should keep your composure, but Kelly is really getting on your nerves.\n\n“Are you going to give me the ticker or not?” you ask.\n“I’ll give you this fucking baton up your ass if you don’t stop giving me shit! In fact why don’t you get the hell out of the car, you’re acting really suspicious.” Kelly remarks.\n\nYou sigh and shake your head.\n\n“Of course. Nothing is ever easy for me.” you say and then you quickly turn the car back on.\n\n“HEY! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! STOP!” Kelly shouts and grabs at the wheel while you attempt to drive off.\n\nYou manage to actually get a few feet before Kelly manages to grab the key out of the ignition. You punch Kelly in the face multiple times, but she’s undeterred in her job of arresting you.\n\nKelly returns your punches with a couple elbows to the face and then pulls you out of the car through the window.\n\n“You’re in deep fucking shit now little sister. You just assaulted a goddamn officer of th…ugh!” Kelly grunts when you punch her as hard as you can in the crotch. It slows her down and you attempt to grab her pistol.\n\nYou manage to undue the snap of the holster, but Kelly stops you from getting and further with a knee to your face. Now SHE pulls out the pistol and points it directly at you.\n\n“Suzy, I’m telling you to fucking stop or I WILL fucking shoot you!” Kelly warns.\n\nYou don’t stop though. Your grand plans have gone to shit once again and you’re a loser here just like you were a loser in your own world. You’re either going to get lucky and wrestle the gun away from Kelly, or she’s going to shoot you. One thing you’re not going to do is go to jail.\n\nKelly sensing her life is in genuine danger now, ignores all the pain she’s in and no longer treats you like her “sister” and starts treating you like a dangerous criminal which you actually are at this point.\n\nKelly shoots you once in the chest, dropping you instantly. You strongly get the impression that she COULD have easily stopped you without a fatal shot, but you imagine that Kelly being herself probably saw this as a perfect opportunity.\n\n“I fucking told you sis.” Kelly remarks.\n“(cough) I’m not your fucking sister, asshole. She’s in the goddamn trunk…” you laugh while still coughing up blood at the same time.\n\nYour last moments are looking the confused look on Kelly’s face before she radios for back up and an ambulance.\n",
  "page 293": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the cell phone ringing. You’re very tired, but when you see who it is, this call isn’t unexpected.\n\n“Hey mom…” you groggily reply.\n“Hey mom? Where are you? I thought you would’ve come back last night!” your mom exclaims.\n“What time is it now?”\n“It’s almost noon! Are you okay?”\n“Mom, mom, mom, calm down. I’m fine. I just…well I drank a little too much…”\n“Drink? You don’t drink!” your mom exclaims.\n“Yeah, I know hence why I’ve been more or less out of it. Diana was really distraught last night and she was already drinking a bit when I got over to her place. She got an eviction notice, she broke up with her boyfriend, she lost her job and just a whole bunch of other drama in genera hit her this week. She really needed a friend to speak with and well, I ended up drinking with her since she was sort of insistent and I wanted to be there for her. Maybe I shouldn’t have, but I think she felt better as the night went on. Of course that might have just been the drink…I dunno…I’m sorry for worrying you though.”\n\nThere is a pause after you give your excuse.\n\n“Okay Suzy. I get it. (Sigh) I’m just glad you had the sense not to drive if you really got that drunk though. I do hope this isn’t a habit though, I know you’re an adult, but you’re still my baby and I don’t like to think of you as being some falling down lush.”\n“Oh mom, that’s not going to happen. Seriously, like I said, I only did it so Diana would feel better. I fully intend to tell her when she wakes up that this won’t be happening again.”\n“Glad to hear it. So when do you think you’ll be home? Your father and I would still like to see you since you actually came here to visit us remember?”\n“I know, I’ll be home in a few hours I suppose. I still feel woozy from last night. Did you need me over immediately though? Because I can do that if you want.”\n“No, no, you take care of everything you need to over there and come over when you’re feeling up to driving. Don’t want you getting into an accident because you’re not feeling one hundred percent.”\n“Okay, I will be over as soon as I can though.”\n“Alright, we’ll see you then. Love you Suzy.”\n“I love you mom.”\n\nYou hang up and rub your eyes a bit.\n\n“Well that’s one thing out of the way. Better get on with the more important task.” You say.\n\nYou open up the door to your room and see a closer parking spot to your room, which is good since you really don’t want to drag that case too far.\n\nYou go to your car and bring it in closer and then head back to your room to gather up everything.\n\n\nYou gather up the bat and axe (which you also wash off in the tub) and toss them in the trunk. Next, you grab the luggage case. With some effort, you drag it to the trunk and lift it inside. You’re really glad you decided to chop her up, you can’t imagine how awkward it would’ve been to carry her intact.\n\nYou take your new purse and duffle bag and leave the room. You’ll come back for the sports car later. The only danger of leaving it here is someone stealing the thing, but then it wasn’t really your car to begin with.\n\nBelieving you’ve taken care of everything you need to here, you start up your car and drive off for north of town.\n\nA few hours later and you’re just finishing up digging a good-sized hole in the ground to shove the case in. You really think you were better off doing this in the day time since you neglected to bring a flashlight which would have made digging in the middle of the woods at night a little more difficult.\n\nYou were a little concerned about some random campers stumbling upon you, or maybe some redneck hunters, but so far you haven’t seen a single thing, which is good.\n\nYou look at the luggage case.\n\n“Well Suzy, now is where we part ways. I wish I could say I didn’t want things to be this way, but I’d be lying. You had a better life and I wanted that so I took it. Maybe that makes me a fucking sociopath or evil or something, I don’t know and I don’t care. All I can say is I’m going to make the most of it and not waste your life the way I wasted my life.”\n\nYou grab the case and shove it into the hole.\n\n“Thanks Suzy and goodbye.” You say and then fill up the hole.\n\nAfter your deed you make the mildly long walk out of the woods and to your car. You throw your shovel in the trunk and sit in the car for a while not doing anything except resting. Digging a hole for a body is some tiring business even if it’s neatly tucked in a case.\n\nYou grab your new phone out of the purse to call your mom so you can let her know you’ll be home soon and that’s when you notice someone else has called while you were out digging.\n\nIt’s your “girlfriend.” Apparently her name is Heather and she left you a voice message which out of curiosity you listen to.\n\n“Hey Suzy, I hope you’re having a good time visiting your family. I just wanted to call though and see how you were. I know you haven’t been gone long, but you know I always miss you when you’re not around. Anyway, call me back when you have time. Oh and I sent you some pictures to keep you occupied when you’re alone! (Giggle!)”\n\nYou go through the phone and see that Heather has indeed sent you more than a few pictures. You see a raven haired girl of small physique with lipstick and eye make up wearing lingerie and making sexy poses. You have to admit, she’s actually very pretty in a slightly goth sort of way.\n\n“Damn, maybe I shouldn’t break up with her immediately.” you chuckle.\n\nYou turn the car on and begin making the journey back to your parent’s house. Along the way you think about everything that’s happened this week and how this is just beginning of your new life. You weren’t joking about making the most of it when you said those words out loud in the woods. You meant that, well except you’re not going to be making the most out of her life, you’re going to be making the most out of YOUR life.\n\nWhile the “transformation” is far from complete, you think the hardest part is over and even if there are challenges or you to overcome, you’ll succeed in surviving and conquering them.\n\nBecause that’s all you’ve done during this Hell week, survived and ultimately conquered it.\n",
  "page 171": "Wanted: Bandit Blondie\n\n\nThe future…\n\n“Give it up Blondie, you got nowhere to go and you’re surrounded! Come out peacefully.” Justice shouts from outside.\n\n“Justice” Why do these bounty hunters always have such silly names?\n\n“Yeah I come out and then you lot take turns bending me over and horse fucking me before you just shoot me in the head anyway? Don’t fucking think so.” You shout back from the abandoned house you’re taking cover in\n\n“Don’t nobody here wanna fuck your sandy STD ridden wasteland pussy bitch!” you hear someone shout.\n“Holy shit is that Mary Liberty out there? How’s your husband doing? Oh right, he’s a charred corpse. Guess I saved you the trouble of a cremation…”\n\nYour taunt is interrupted by machine gunfire causing you to take cover.\n\n“Mary, stop it! You’re just wastin’ ammo!” you hear another voice shout.\n“I hear Bounty Bill out there too. I gotta say I’m really touched that you came all the way out from the Iron Union just for me. Guess those teeth marks on your dick really left a lasting impression.” You laugh remembering how you got away from him last time.\n“Keep laughing Blondie. I’ll soon have more fond memories of you when that pretty golden mane of yours is detached from your scalp and is hanging up on my wall.” Bill replies.\n\n“Alright enough! This isn’t about personal vendettas! This is a Ground Zero job and we’re going to act like fucking professionals. Now Blondie, I counted how many shots you fired and you got exactly ONE left. You can’t win this and you’re not getting away. If you come out peacefully however I can assure you that you will not be harmed and you will get a fair trial.”\n“Fair trial before a GZ Board? You must be huffing gasoline if you actually believe that. They’re more likely going to throw me in a cell and perform whatever fucked up experiments they do on me like they do with anyone that pisses them off. You’re working for the most amoral entity in the wasteland Mr. Justice. Your name has never been more hypocritical.” You shout back\n“Yeah, yeah, look this is your last chance Blondie. You coming out or not?”\n\nYou look at your pistol and stand up near the window yet still remaining in cover.\n\n“One bullet is all I need. Come and get my body bitches.” You yell, fire your pistol in the air and then fall backwards so they can see your body fall in the view of the window.\n\n“Goddamn it, she offed herself.” Someone shouts.\n“Move it, but remain alert! It could be a trick!” Justice shouts.\n\nWell at least Justice is still thinking a bit, but he’s still severely underestimating you if he thinks he’s got you trapped. You wouldn’t have run in here had you not had a plan. This isn’t just some random abandoned house, it’s one of the many places you store supplies. Some of which are fully loaded weapons.\n\nSeveral bounty hunters cautiously enter the front entrance of the house, but it doesn’t do them any good when you cut down most of them with an assault rifle before they can take cover.\n\nHearing more pour in from the back, you throw a smoke grenade to cover yourself and retreat elsewhere into the house where you have a trapdoor that leads under the house.\n\n“Goddamn fucking smoke. Can’t see shit!” someone shouts.\n“Fuck this, burn it all down.” Another says and you hear footsteps starting to exit the house from above you.\n\nMeanwhile you continue to crawl under the house, eventually making your way under the backsteps. There you see in the area is Bounty Bill and a few other hunters.\n\n“Shit, she’s right there!” Bounty Bill shouts before you riddle him and his buddies with bullets. Doesn’t take long before more hunters run around from the front to the back to flank you.\n\nYou barely manage to escape unscathed, but fortunately luck is still with you this day. You notice the house is starting to emanate black smoke from the front and the distinct smell of fire is now in the air. You also hear a vehicle revving up.\n\nYou pick up a couple of the pistols off the dead and cautiously head around the front of the house. You get there just in time to see Justice driving away like a little bitch. However, revenge is still very much here and Mary Liberty opens fire. You feel a painful sensation of a bullet going into your left leg.\n\n“Fuck!” you exclaim and dive for cover and crawl behind one of many now abandoned vehicles.\n\n“You’re a dead bitch Blondie! You hear me!?!” Mary shouts while spraying your cover with bullets.\n\nYou and Mary have an old fashioned run and duck shoot out for several minutes, however unlike what happens in old movies, it does not ultimately result in some physical catfight with lesbian undertones where upon you proceed to rip each other’s clothes off.\n\nYou just manage to get lucky again and shoot Mary in her right tit causing her to go down with the utterance of swears coming from her mouth.\n\nYou limp over to where she fell and see she’s still trying to grab her pistol that she dropped. You shoot her in the hand blowing off a few of her fingers and causing her hand to recoil and she screams in pain. You pick up the pistol and train your own weapon on her. Already having a hard time breathing from the hole in her chest, she clutches her bloody hand with the other. The look in her eyes display a hatred you’ve seen many times before.\n\n“I…I …I’ll see you in hell Blondie.” She utters, spitting blood.\n“Probably.” You say and then end Mary’s life with a shot to her dome.\n\nWith all your enemies dead you sit on the trunk of a nearby car and watch your stash house burn down while you ponder what to do next.\n\nThe bullet wound in your leg will have to be seen to, so you’ll have to make a run to another location where you’ve stashed some medical supplies. The bullet went through so at least you don’t need to worry about digging something out. You’re just glad she wasn’t using hollow points and tie off your leg with your over shirt.\n\nIn any case, you’re sure Justice will be back to chasing you around when he manages to scrounge up some more mooks. Honestly you’d like to catch a break where you don’t feel like you have to look over your shoulder every other day, but this is the path you chose and as they say there ain’t no rest for the wicked.\n\nDidn’t start out that way though you think. You honestly were just trying to survive, just like you continue to do today…but you suppose you really did start having a bit too much fun in doing what you did and still do. You wonder if it’s genetic. Your uncle was a serial killer after all.\n\nIn any case you’re a far cry from being the “good girl” that once hid in the basement.\n\nAll this self-reflection does give you an idea for your next destination after you patch up your leg.\n\nHome.\n\nIt’s been years since you’ve been anywhere near there. You’ve deliberately avoided it for several reasons, but you figure since you seemingly have more and more places where you’re wanted dead nowadays you figure hiding out back in the old hometown might be worthwhile or at least interesting.\n\nYou loot Mary’s body for her vehicle’s keys and leave the dead and burning behind you. As you drive you wonder who is in charge of the town, is it still in shambles infested with those freaks (Though you haven’t seen any of those in years now), did someone actually rebuild it, and is that redneck community still around?\n\n“Well doesn’t matter who’s there or in charge, but they all better hide in THEIR basements, because Suzy’s coming back home.” You say to yourself.\n",
  "page 174": "You’ll be damned if you’re going to let this spiral into a power struggle with the possibility that Ray could be in charge. If Mel isn’t going to do anything about it, you sure as hell will if only to assert that you aren’t someone to be fucked with.\n\nRay and his buddies approach the tent and you shoot Ray square in the back. He howls and slumps to the ground. Ray’s buddies at this point believe themselves to be under attack and react accordingly. One wisely runs for cover and returns fire, while another foolishly fumbles with his grenade still out in the open.\n\nMel shouts at you, but everyone is now shooting. Most are shooting at Ray’s buddies, but the carnies are now taking advantage of the minor infighting your side is experiencing and have come back out to fire upon everyone again. The one fumbling with the grenade gets hit several times, but not before he throws the grenade in your direction.\n\nYou run away from the truck that you were taking cover by, but in the crossfire you’re hit in the leg. You fall to the ground and try to crawl away from the grenade.\n\nYou don’t get far though and it goes off destroying the truck. You would’ve survived this since you were far enough away to only lose most of your hearing from the blast. What you don’t survive is the flying piece metal from the truck that hits you when the grenade exploded.\n\nWith a hot piece of twisted metal embedded in your skull, your struggle is over.\n",
  "page 173": "Opening fire on anyone other than carnies probably isn’t a good idea, at least not on your own. Maybe if Mel gave the order it might be different, but again he surprises you and doesn’t do such a thing.\n\n“Ray, you’re a goddamn idiot.” Mel shouts and just watches as Ray and the two others quicken their pace towards the tent.\n\nAll three of them get half way to the tent and then prepare to throw, which they do. Two of the grenades hit the tent, but one manages to roll inside it. Unfortunately for them one of the carnies steps in the tent entrance and throws it back!\n\n“Holy fuck! Run!” is all Ray manages to shout which is then followed by a bit of gunfire from the carnie who threw the grenade. He’s hit the leg, but that’s not the worst of it since he’s not that far from the grenade when he falls to the ground.\n\nMel, you and everyone else take cover behind the trucks in preparation for the explosions soon to follow, all three of them.\n\nWhen the smoke clears and everyone slowly looks out from behind their cover.\n\nIt’s a devastating mess. The big tent is partially gone, though surprisingly still standing. One can see inside most of it now though and there are a lot of bodies…\n\nSpeaking of bodies, Ray’s is in pieces since he failed to get away from the blast in time. A crater now exists where the grenade fell and Ray’s body parts aren’t too far from it. The ones who followed Ray faired better and managed to get away from the blast.\n\n“I fuckin’ knew something like that was gonna happen. Come on spread out and head towards what’s left of that tent. Careful though, they might still have some fight left!” Mel shouts with nobody really mourning the loss of Ray.\n\nYou all cautiously proceed forward with weapons raised and taking cover as much as possible. While it’s always better to be safe than sorry, there isn’t much fight left in any of the survivors who are now a mixture of wounded, dying or just plain scared.\n\n“Please! We surrender! Take whatever you want, just don’t kill us!” one of the midgets shouts from amongst the carnage.\n“Goddamn right we will be! None of this woulda been necessary had you just given us whatever medical supplies or medicine you had! Now besides this fuckin’ big top, is there anyone else lurking around that we should know about?”\n“Uh…um…”\n“That’s not a fuckin’ answer!”\n“I dunno! I mean yeah, maybe! There might be a few people hidin’ in the trailers, just don’t kill anyone else, please!”\n“Some of you search the rest of this place, but keep an eye out for more carnies! If anyone gives ya too much trouble, you know what to do.” Mel shouts.\n\nThe remainder of your time is mostly spent looking through what remains of the tent which actually did hold some medical supplies though not many and some of them were obviously destroyed by the grenades.\n\nAs their belongings and supplies are looted and they are “herded” into group, the carnies, the carnies make no attempts at resistance and if there were any hiding in the trailers, they must’ve ran for the wilderness or were really good at hiding, because nobody finds anyone else.\n\nSeveral make an attempt to beg you to leave something, but these are met with verbal commands to shut up before they suffer further. Another pleads to Mel to think about their own wounded, but this is met with smash to the gut with Mel’s rifle. It’s the only physical abuse that occurs before they realize they’re receiving the only mercy they’re currently experiencing.\n\nYour own personal feelings on the current situation is that it’s certainly not “right” but what can you do?\n\nAfter looting the carnival of what useful stuff they have, you leave the demoralized carnies and head back to the trailer park.\n\n“Well that went better than expected, just lost Ray, I’m sure you’re really broken up by that.” Mel says.\n“Crushed. Surprised you didn’t shoot him for directly challenging your authority though.” You say.\n“I was more concerned with the carnies than Ray at that point. Any other time I might’ve given him a beat down, but I wouldn’t have fucking killed him. Sheesh blondie, haven’t you learned by now that just because I’m an asshole to everyone, doesn’t mean I’m some fuckin’ heartless killer? I mean the whole point of this fuckin’ endeavor was to get medicine for folks who are bitten. If I was that cold, I woulda just shot ‘em like some people wanted me to do. Shit, I didn’t even enjoy any of what I had to do to those carnies. I mean I know they had their people to look after, but so did we an’ I ain’t sorry for it.”\n“Hm, well I suppose you’re right. Guess we’re all a little more complex than appearances would seem.”\n“So, you see us all a little more than stupid trailer park trash now blondie?” Mel asks.\n“Actually I’ve more or less discarded that view since I’ve been staying here besides I’m hardly in a position to talk seeing as I’m living with you all.”\n“So K’ blondie, we needed someone to fill out the snobby tease role in the community anyway.”\n\nYou chuckle.\n\n“I’m really not though. I’m just selective about my standards.” You say.\n“Don’t need to justify anything to me. I got a woman.” Mel replies.\n“The thing is despite it all, so far you lot have been at least been cordial with me as my own family was. Dunno if that’s funny or sad.”\n“Well depends. Stick around long enough blondie an’ you might just become part of our family.”\n\nYou start to outright laugh.\n\n“See, you should fuckin’ laugh more around the others. It makes you seem less snooty.” Mel replies.\n\n“I guess anything’s possible. Doesn’t look like I’m going anywhere anytime soon.” You remark.\n\nYou and Mel continue to converse on the way back to the trailer park. It’s mostly about nothing of major importance, but eventually he goes on about how the next step on the agenda is to contact his cousin Clem who apparently owns a farm further past where the carnival was located.\n\n“Figure we’re gonna have to do something about our food soon and instead of riskin’ killin’ ourselves going into the town for whatever scraps are left, it might be best to enlist my cousin’s help in that matter.” Mel says.\n“So you really think order won’t be restored by the government?” you ask.\n“Pftt, fuck no blondie. Considerin’ how the National Guard came in last time, I’d just as soon not want government assholes around anyway. But my guess is things are gonna be fucked up like this for a long time so self-sufficiency is gonna have to be a priority.\n\nPretty much the assessment you and most others have had. Still, it’s a good sign that Mel’s at least thinking ahead with the food situation.\n\nEventually you get back to the trailer park where things appear to be running smoothly. The bitten folks are finally seen to properly. The good news is the bites don’t seem to be infectious at least not in the “zombie bite” sense. The bad news is not all of them make it and Billy Ray dies of his wounds, depriving the trailer park of yet another member with “Ray” in their name.\n\nAs for other things of importance, mostly everyone who is able is pitching in to help in some way. Still realizing you’ve got to work with these people now, you volunteer to keep look out near the entrance for the remainder of the day and part of the night (Which is thankfully uneventful) until eventually some guy named Bob tells you that they’re taking over the graveyard shift.\n\nHaving been relieved of your duties, you return to your trailer, which is starting to feel more comfortable to you. It’s no basement, but it’s home.\n",
  "page 294": "Mirror rorriM\n\n\nThe Future…\n\nYour siblings, spouses, children, and you all stand in your mother’s bedroom. It probably won’t be long now.\n\nYou always knew the day would come when you’d lose her again and that day is today. While you might have been more prepared for it this time, it doesn’t make it any less sad. You didn’t even feel this sad when your dad died years ago and you loved him very much, though maybe that’s because you always still had the tainted memory of your crappy alternate one.\n\nYour mother though in both realities was always there for you and you’ve never forgotten that.\n\n“Now that I’ve said my goodbyes to everyone…I want….I want to speak to Suzy…alone…” your mother utters.\n\nEveryone is a little surprised by this unexpected request. You are too, since you thought everyone was going to be in her room until the end.\n\n“What? But mother…” Kelly starts to say looking almost a little offended.\n“Kelly. Not now. Not today.” Ben says with a stern voice.\n\nKelly looks at Ben like she wants to argue, but he’s about the only person that can make her back down. She does however give you the stare of death.\n\nKelly never changes no matter what reality. She always hates you. There actually was a slightly comforting consistency when you first encountered her.\n\n“Fine. She’s all yours, just like she always is.” Kelly snaps and storms out the room.\n\nBen exhales and shrugs with a slight widening of his eyes looking at you.\n\n“It’s okay…I’m used to it.” You say.\n“Alright, everyone come on let’s leave these two alone to talk.” Ben replies.\n\nBen escorts his children out of the room while Julie goes up and gives you a quick hug before following them.\n\nYou kiss and hug your husband and tell your daughter that you’ll see them later.\n\nAfter they leave it’s just you and mom. You pull up your chair as close as you can to the bed and sit near her and hold her hand.\n\n“I’m here mom.” You say.\n“Yes…yes you are. You’ve always been here. (Cough) Even when you weren’t.”\n\nYour mom at this point turns to look directly at you and despite her very weak state you feel her hand squeeze yours somewhat strongly and she gives you a sudden intense look.\n\n“I know you’re not Suzy…or rather you’re not the Suzy I gave birth to…” she says with a tone that you’ve never heard before. It isn’t anger or anything negative, but it is one that puts you so off guard that you get a chill down your back.\n\n“Mom, I…” you begin to sputter before she interrupts you.\n“Don’t. I know. I’ve known for a very long time now. A mother always knows her own child.”\n\nYou don’t know how to react. You look down and away from your “mother. You actually feel a little sick and you start to tremble a bit. You have never once in all these years felt bad about what you did, but now you’re not so sure. You begin to sniffle and tears start to form.\n\n“Shhhh, Suzy. Save your tears for when I’m truly gone because it doesn’t matter. You’re still my daughter, but I couldn’t go to my grave without letting you know that I knew. I also thought I’d tell you for your sake. Now (cough) I don’t want to know the gruesome details…about HOW this came to be, but if its been weighing on your conscience at all, you didn’t actually replace the Suzy I gave birth to anyway.”\n\nThis is beyond unexpected. How is it possible that she knows all this just on instinct? You look up at your mother.\n\n“My Suzy…the Suzy I knew as the daughter I gave birth to? Something happened to her a long time ago. (cough cough) Something changed soon after she went to college. I never could place my finger on it, but first time she visited I knew something was different. And it wasn’t just due to experimenting with new ideas and sexuality in college. SHE was different and I KNEW she was. As I said, a mother knows, but the frequent little inconsistencies in her memories and such made it certain. Just as I learned with you.”\n\nYou just continue holding your mother’s hand as she speaks.\n\n“But what could I do? What could I say? Who would believe such a fantastic tale? Sure this new Suzy was a little more full of herself, but she still loved me just like my Suzy did. I couldn’t lose my baby daughter twice so I never spoke up. Never (cough) dreamed it would happen again though. I suppose in some ways I might have even been glad though. You replaced the one who replaced mine.”\n\nNever did you ever believe that your mother knew. To learn this now is just as overwhelming as when you had to deal with the situation so long ago.\n\n“Why…why didn’t you say anything before?” you ask looking up.\n“Why ruin a good relationship? You never disrespected me and treated me kindly. You always visited when you could and you even moved back to town with your family when your father died so you could be closer to me. You obviously loved me very much. Could I really ask for a better daughter?” your mother says with a faint smile.\n\nThe feelings are almost overwhelming you at this point. You’re completely at a loss. At this point your mom gives your hand another squeeze, but weaker this time.\n\n“You’re my daughter. My baby and I always loved you. Never doubt that.” She says.\n“I don’t…(Sob)” you say and attempt to hold it together.\n\nYour mother’s grip is becoming less firm now.\n\n“Soon none of this will matter, but before I go…I want to know a couple things…” your mother says weakly.\n“Of course.” You reply.\n“What…(cough) was your other mother like?”\n“She…(sniffle) was very much like you. She was kind and was the only one who ever truly cared when I was growing up. I…(sob) was still little when she died…I missed her very much…” you say trying to keep from crying completely.\n\nYour mother nods.\n\n“I see…I suppose…(cough cough) that answer might partially answer my other question then…”\n“What’s that?”\n“How many other Suzys were there after you?”\n\nYou’re silent for a moment.\n\n“Three that I know of. I think you may have even met one of them.”\n“Mm…considering you were never replaced… I suppose…you just wanted this life more than they did then…”\n“It…(sob) has been a good life…(sob)”\n\nYour mother pats your hand.\n\n“And you’ll still have a good life Suzy, even after I’m gone…” she says.\n\nAt this point your mother’s eyes begin to flutter and then shut completely and her breathing becomes shallow.\n\nYou stay until the end and then sadness is completely released. You cry over your loss and head towards the door, not wishing to be in the same room with the empty shell that was your mother any longer.\n\nWhen you exit, your husband immediately sees had distraught you are and goes to comfort you. Your daughter has been visibly crying as well. Ben, says that he’ll start making the arrangements for the funeral, meanwhile Kelly takes it upon herself to call medical personnel.\n\nLater, the drive back home is quieter, with your daughter Sally sleeping in the backseat and your husband Roger just paying attention to the road.\n\nIt’s been an emotional roller coaster for you today. More than you even thought it would be, but you’re sort of glad your mother knew. Somehow her knowing and still loving and accepting you anyway made it just as real as how your reality’s mom felt towards you.\n\nYou also wonder if this means you won’t have to put up with any other reality hopping Suzys any longer. That might be a little too much to hope for though, after all your life is still a good one and you have much to be happy about in the scheme of things. Your mother was right about that.\n\nDoesn’t matter, you’ll continue to fight for it just like you always have because now you truly have a life worth fighting for.\n\n“You okay over there honey?” Roger asks.\n“Yes, well no, but I guess I’m just trying to think about all the good times I had with mom. You know, focus on the positive.”\n“That’s good Suzy. I think that’s a healthy approach.” He replies.\n\nRoger always has been a supportive husband to you. You never would have thought you would have fallen for a soldier type before. You sometimes wonder if you and Roger ever met in another reality.\n\n“Yeah, it’s odd, but I think I’m also coming up with an idea for a new book. Figure maybe I should re-channel all this negativity into something productive.” You say.\n“Oh? What idea?”\n“Well I suppose my mind is still a bit fragmented for a solid idea, but I’m thinking of doing a sequel to Mirrors.”\n“Oh, your scifi book about parallel dimensions? That one was pretty popular. I know I certainly liked it better than that one your wrote about that inbred cultist family. That one was a little too gruesome for my tastes.”\n“Well I had to make a dramatic break from my first three books. Up until then, all people thought I could write was lesbian pirate erotica.”\n“Hey I liked Treasure Chest. I thought it was a pretty deep love story.” Roger says.\n“Oh I know why YOU liked it.” You say chuckling a little bit and allowing yourself to feel a little better.\n“Well okay I liked the obvious too, well anyway do you have any idea on what the new story might involve?”\n“It will probably just pick up a few years after Mirror left off and I’ll see how it goes from there. Like I said, it’s just in the idea stages now, but whatever I come up with, I’ll definitely be dedicating it in the memory of mom.”\n“Well I think that’s a very good way to honor her. She certainly has contributed to your inspiration.”\n\nYou nod.\n\n“In more ways than one Roger. In more ways than one.”\n",
  "page 176": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou groggily awaken to the sounds of a bunch of giggling outside, a few bangs on your door and what sounds to be a thumping sound on the side of your trailer.\n\nYou look out the window and see a bunch of children playing outside. While you knew there were kids here it was weird that you never really saw them grouped together until today.\n\nMaking sure you’re decent, you step outside where upon one of the smaller kids suddenly stops bouncing his ball against your trailer.\n\n“See, I told ya that Tina said that pretty blond lady lived here.” One of the boys says.\n“Why the hell are all you kids doing around my trailer?” you ask.\n“Tina said we should come over here where we were out of the way since most of the adults are either workin’ on the new barricades or that tank lookin’ thing in the field over there.” One of the kids says and points in that direction.\n“I don’t understand what that all has to do with me.” You ask.\n“Tina said you’d look after us.”\n\nAt this point you drop your head in defeat. It’s too early in the day for this.\n\n“You okay lady?”\n“Yeah I’m fine kid. Just re-evaluating what my position is in the community here.”\n“Um…yeah anyway, I told Tina that we didn’t need some baby sitter, but then Mel shouted at all of us so we ran over here, before he got madder.”\n“Huh, I wasn’t scared. I just didn’t feel like helping that ol’ asshole anyway.” A slightly older kid says attempting to puff up his chest.\n\nSo you’ve been assigned to baby-sitting. You aren’t sure if that’s bad or good. On one hand you’re tempted to take it as a good sign since the folks here are obviously trusting enough for you to look after their offspring.\n\nThen again they may just not give a shit and these kids could be little hellraisers that their parents want nothing to do with.\n\n“Hey lady, did you kill any zombies a couple days ago?” one child asks you.\n“Tommy, they weren’t zombies ya moron! They were just crazy people!” a girl shouts.\n“How do you know Jenny?” Tommy asks.\n“Cause my mama shot one in the chest and it died! Zombies only die if you hit ‘em in the head!”\n“Yeah, an’ the people who got bit didn’t turn into zombies either, not even Billy Ray an’ he died!” another kid exclaims.\n\nAt this point the children begin arguing about zombies until you interrupt.\n\n“Okay quiet down kids, but to answer your question Tommy, yes I did kill a few of those…well whatever they were.” You say.\n“Were you scared?! I was scared when they attacked! I hid under my mama’s bed!” the kid with the ball admits.\n\nAt this point the oldest boy, who was claiming he wasn’t afraid of Mel, boldly comes up to you. He looks like he might be thirteen at most\n\n“Hah, I wasn’t scared. I even shot one of those things right in the face! Pow! See, I’m not a scared little kid like the rest of them here.” The boy says puffing up again and making gun gestures.\n“Hmm, I see. Back up boy.” You say.\n“Why?”\n“Because you’re invading my personal space.” You answer.\n“I wanna invade more than that.” The boy says laughing at his own innuendo. One of the boys laugh along with him; the Jenny girl rolls her eyes. All the rest of the kids look confused on the matter. Considering you’re used to hearing similar from the older knuckle draggers around here, you’re hardly surprised to hear it from this snot nosed brat.\n\n“Well, better save that idea for your wet dreams boy, cause that’s never going to happen.” You remark frankly, which causes Jenny to laugh a bit.\n“What are you some sort of dyke like Butchie Billie? Come on I like older women…” the teen says and at this point tries to grab your chest, but you easily grab his wrist.\n\n“What the fuck do you think you’re doing you little shit?! Have you lost your fucking mind?” you say and start digging your nails into his flesh.\n“OWWW! Lemme go you crazy bitch!” the boy cries and then you twist his arm behind his back.\n“That’s right I AM a fucking crazy ass bitch! My uncle was a goddamn serial killer, my ex-boyfriend was a cultist, and I killed several of those fucking cannibal freaks without blinking. Now get the fuck outta here before I do worse to your little ass!” you say in his ear and kick him off the steps of your trailer.\n\nThe boy goes face first into the dirt and while he quickly picks himself up, he just glares at you and runs away. It’s obvious he’s going off to cry somewhere.\n\n“Hahahahaha! That was so cool what you did to Alan! Can you teach me to do that?” Jenny asks.\n“Was your uncle really a serial killer?” Tommy asks.\n\nBefore you can answer a bright flash followed by a loud noise in the distance grabs everyone’s attention. A couple of the kids scream about their eyes, fortunately you weren’t looking in the direction at the time, but it was still really bright.\n\nYou then look to the west and in the far distance you see it. A mushroom cloud.\n\nYou’re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn’t engulfed you, so you’re guessing that it wasn’t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one. Still, you can’t help but wonder if you’re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though. If so there isn’t much that can done about it.\n\n“So…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n\nOddly you don’t even feel any fear. You’re a little anxious you suppose, but the events of this past week have probably helped in putting you in a “doomsday” mindset already.\n\nAt this point several of the children huddle together a bit, a few run off to presumably find their parents. A couple of them are visibly crying.\n\n“Are we going to die soon?” Jenny asks.\n“Eventually perhaps, but not today.” You answer.\n\nAt this point you see several women running towards your direction presumably the mothers of these children (oddly you see no fathers, you don’t know if that’s because they’re busy or none of these children have one).\n\nAfter the various mothers either scream at you for not looking after their child “properly” (Never mind the fact that they should have been doing it) or are actually pleasant and thank you while they calm down their child, you see Tina briskly approaching, she waves at you.\n\n“Hey blondie, we’ve got an important meeting. Your presence is required.” Tina remarks.\n“Glad to see I’m being included in these major decisions unlike this morning.” You say walking towards Tina.\n“Hey, you got to sleep in late and barely had to look after all these brats due to nukes, I’d say you got off easy as far as work is concerned.”\n\nAs you walk with Tina, you can already hear the shouting from the crowd gathering around Mel’s trailer.\n\n“So how bad off are we?” you ask.\n“Well if Mel’s cousin ends up helping on the food and water front, like Mel thinks he will, I suppose we’ll be fine. Just need to travel up to his farm. Mel’s thinking we’ll probably still have to make another attempt into town though for shit. Might as well give you a heads up blondie, but I think you’ll be going on one or the other of these trips today.” Tina says.\n“Figured as much. Honestly, I think I’d rather do that than be a baby sitter.”\n\nWith Tina chuckling at your remark, you briefly think about your past life and realize it was just as well you enjoyed your “good girl” basement dwelling years as much as you did. If you’d actually done anything with your life, it would’ve likely been for naught anyway considering current events.\n\nYou sort of wonder what happened to your siblings and even your ex-boyfriend. Are they all dead now? Are they alive? Do you even care at all? Not really, though you’re pretty sure that you’re going to beat the shit out of Donna if you ever see her again.\n\nYou also wonder if you’ll ever leave this place eventually since you can’t really ever seeing yourself being “one of the crowd” here. Still, you’ll have see how things play out.\n\nIn any event, this is all stuff for a possible future and you’ll worry about it then, right now you have to worry about surviving the day.\n",
  "page 297": "Really either choice seems pretty shitty, but if Jack feels that strongly about the jungle being worse, you guess you’ll take the snow (and probably freeze to death). You suppose the upside is that there are probably less deadly animals lurking about as there might be in a jungle.\n\n“You better be right about this Jack.” You say,\n\nYou’re almost at the door when everything goes dark. You feel like those things are almost upon you and you can only hope they stop pursuing you when you go through the door.\n\nWith a boost of energy and a shove, you and Jack both tumble through the opening and into the snowy area. Snow gets all over you both and it’s at that point you notice there are also a lot of trees nearby, so it’s not just endless tundra, which is at least a good sign that you didn’t wind up Antarctica.\n\nYou also recover as quickly as you can, fearing that those creatures are still right behind you, but when you get up you find that not only are they not, but the Gray Building itself is gone. Nothing is behind you save for more snow and trees.\n\n“Where the hell? Where did it go?” you say.\n“It’s gone. We’re some place completely different and who knows where the hell that building is now. Shit…my head is still throbbing and all fucked up. I still don’t feel quite right. Just let me rest here a moment.” Jack says still sitting on the snowy ground.\n\nYou look up and while the clouds are covering the sun, it’s definitely still daytime wherever you are, but with the wind making the cold even worse, you’re going to have to find shelter pretty damn quick and you have no idea which way to go. For all you know you’re in the Canadian wilderness or some other godforsaken place.\n\n“Goddamn, it’s cold.” You say.\n“Yeah, we need to get going, even though I’m still feeling woozy. We need to keep an eye out for everything though. I guess we better pick a direction and hope we find friendly civilization.” Jack says and gets up.\n\nAs Jack gets up while you look around again and decide on a direction.\n\n“Well at least you’ve still got your axe and I got a bat. This direction looks as good as any.” You say pointing to the right.\n“I suppose so.” Jack replies.\n\nYou and Jack begin your trek through the snow…\n\nThe snow actually isn’t really that deep, but it’s deep enough that it’s not pleasant to walk through. The wind eventually dies down a bit which makes things a little better, but not by much. You and Jack are both very cold and periodically you’re rubbing your hands together and blowing on them in a futile effort to keep them warm.\n\n“This is sucking so much, we’re going to freeze to death out here in the fucking forest.” You say suddenly stopping.\n“Well maybe, but we gotta keep moving. We just gotta stay positive.”\n“Yeah, well as you might already know, positive things haven’t been happening to me lately.” You respond.\n“Trust me, you aren’t only one.” Jack replies.\n“…I’m sorry, I’m just really cold, and as brave as I’m trying to be about all this, I feel like I’ve already been pushing my luck all this week and I feel like this is going to be it. Like my dumb luck has run out and I’m really fucking scared of dying.” You say trying to remain calm.\n“I know.” Jack replies and puts his hand on your shoulder.\n\nIt isn’t much comfort, but if the end is coming soon, you could have worse company.\n\n“Come on, you’re right, we need to keep moving.” You say and the pair of you continues on.\n\nA few moments later, you feel like your fingers and toes have gone numb and you’re even starting to get a little sleepy. Day is starting to end and night will be beginning soon.\n\nJust when you believe it’s starting to look even worse than ever, you and Jack notice some smoke rising in the distance up ahead, and as they say where there is smoke there is fire. (Hopefully)\n\nYou and Jack both quicken your pace as much as you can and eventually you reach the edge of the ground, which starts sloping downward from your location. In the short distance from that you see a small log cabin with smoke coming from it.\n\nSalvation, but somehow you doubt if it’s going to be easy.\n\n“You know there are going to be people living there.” You say.\n“Yeah, but I mean come on, we’re freezing to death, surely they’ll help us. At best they’ll let us warm up before giving us directions to the next nearest town.”\n“Jack, your optimism would actually be very charming if we weren’t in the situation we’re currently in.” you say.\n“Well hopefully you’ll better appreciate it when we’re nice and warm. Come on.” Jack says.\n\nYou and Jack carefully make your way down the slope and soon you’re at the cabin. You see piles of logs stacked nearby, along with some barrels. The cabin doesn’t have any windows or at least none on the sides that you’ve seen.\n\n“Okay, so how are we doing this?” you ask.\n“Well I guess I’ll knock.” Jack says.\n\nJack bangs on the door a couple times.\n\n“Hello? Anyone in there? We’re freezing and we need help. Hello?” he says.\n\nThere is no answer. You don’t even hear any noise.\n\n“Maybe nobody is home after all.” You say.\n“But there’s smoke coming from the chimney, obviously there’s probably a fire going on in there.” Jack replies.\n“Well, maybe they’re out hunting or something and there’s a scared kid in there that was told not to open the door to strangers. See if the door is unlocked.” You say.\n“Wait a minute, didn’t you just say there might be a scared kid in there?”\n“Yeah and if there is, he’s still going to be scared whether we’re inside or outside. We need to get in there Jack, we can deal with the consequences later!” you exclaim.\n\nJack exhales.\n\n“Well okay…” Jack says as he goes for the handle.\n\nSurprisingly it opens and when Jack peers into the dimly lit cabin, he sees absolutely no one inside.\n\n“This place is empty.” Jack says.\n“Good, now let’s get to that damn fire!” you say and push past Jack.\n\nYou warm up by the fireplace while Jack shuts the door and locks it with a large piece of wood across it. He soon joins and sits down right next to you.\n\n“Oh, sorry.” Jack says when he thinks he’s too close to you, but you stop him from moving over.\n“Jack, I think we’re at that point in our relationship that under normal circumstances, we’d probably be dating already. You’re fine, in fact why don’t you just hold me. I could use the extra warmth.”\n\nJack complies with your request and you’re feeling a little warmer already. As you still trying to enjoy the warmth, Jack is still looking around the room a bit from his position.\n\n“This is strange.” Jack mentions.\n“Really? I thought this was probably the least strange thing we’ve done since we met.”\n“No, I mean this cabin, something seems very, I dunno, medieval.”\n“Well it is a log cabin in the middle of the woods, it isn’t like it’s going to have the amenities of the modern world.”\n“Yeah, but have you noticed the decorations? A shield and a sword are hanging over on that wall along with a small banner of some sort. Over there in that corner is a set of spears. There also a lot of furs just laying around.”\n“Maybe the guy that lives here is a historical buff on top of being a hunter. You know, trying to live the way they did back in the old days.”\n“Yeah, well I’ve never seen something like that either. Look.”\n“What? That’s just a deer’s head…oh what the hell? That’s fucking hideous looking.” You say just noticing the head of some very furry creature with far too many teeth mounted on the wall.\n\nIt doesn’t look like anything you’ve ever seen on those nature or animal shows. You shiver a bit looking at the damn thing causing Jack to give you a bit of a squeeze.\n\n“Ugh, I don’t want to look at that thing. What is it?” you say.\n“That’s what I’m saying, I dunno. I mean a lot of this shit looks familiar, but seeing something like makes me less sure.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“I dunno. I mean I’m wondering if we’re even on our world.”\n\nIn all the worrying about freezing to death, you suppose it never occurred that might not actually be on Earth.\n\n“You think the Gray Building sent us to a different dimension or something?”\n“I have no idea, but with that thing it’s not out of the realm of possibility. I mean you told me yourself you experienced reality weirdness when you were speaking with that bald guy.”\n“Yeah, that’s true…shit. We might be in some real trouble.”\n“Well, in the chance that we are on another world, I’d say we can at least look on the bright side that we aren’t going to get nuked any time soon.”\n“Heh, always looking on the bright side.”\n“Did it charm you this time?”\n“A little bit.” You say with a smile.\n\nAfter warming up completely, you and Jack explore the cabin a little more in detail, which doesn’t take too long considering it’s not excessively big. Some of that exploration includes raiding the foodstuff stored in the cabinets and the actual stew that’s in the hanging pot over the fire. All you find to drink is water and some sort of sweet alcohol. Jack says that’s probably mead.\n\nOne of the more important things you find is a small pouch of coins. A few are gold, some are silver and a lot of them are copper. You also find a few books, but they’re in some sort of language you don’t understand.\n\nThe last thing you discover is a trap door near the bed to a small root cellar where there is more food and water stored. Looks like you might be okay if you have to stay here awhile at least.\n\nThe only short term major concern is a toilet at which point Jack points that while it’s possible there is an outhouse you missed somewhere in the area, you both might have to be roughing that in the cold air of nature. You’re not looking forward to either possibility.\n\nYou remark about how this place reminds you of something from a video game you played on your computer, which only cements Jack’s view that you’re possibly not on your world any longer, or at best you’ve been transported back in time on earth to who knows where. That thing’s head on the wall seems to favor the former though.\n\nEventually though as the night moves on, you start to get tired again, but this time you’re not in danger of dying of hypothermia. It’s soon pointed out that there is only one bed.\n\n“Well I guess I’ll let you take the bed.” Jack says.\n“Actually I want to sleep by the fire, I’m just going to grab some more of those furs to sleep on. You can take the bed, or if you really want to, sleep with me by the fire.” You say.\n“Well that’s no choice at all, of course I’m going to sleep with you by the fire.” Jack says.\n“Fine with me, as long as you know I’m just using you for your warm body.” You reply with a smile.\n“Well, just respect me in the morning.” Jack smiles back.\n“Um, speaking of that. Do you think we should be worried that the owner will be coming back at some point?”\n“Probably, but if someone comes knocking on the door, it isn’t like we’re weaponless.”\n“True, okay let’s try to get some rest and figure out what we’re going to do tomorrow.”\n\nYou and Jack lay down several furs on the floor and settle in to sleep. Despite this situation not exactly being the best, you both at least enjoy the closeness of each other.\n",
  "page 296": "Jack may have had a bad experience with the jungle before, but you’re going to have one infinitely worse you don’t get the hell out of here!\n\nYou don’t know where you’re going to end up, but you figure at least there is more chance of survival in the jungle than the tundra or artic or wherever you might end up with the snow door.\n\nSince Jack isn’t exactly in a position to argue, you continue heading towards the jungle.\n\nYou’re almost at the door when everything goes dark. You feel like those things are almost upon you and you can only hope they stop pursuing you when you go through the door.\n\nWith a boost of energy and a shove, you and Jack both tumble through the opening and into the jungle area. Soft muddy ground gets all over you both.\n\nYou recover as quickly as you can, fearing that those creatures are still right behind you, but when you get up you find that not only are they not, but the Gray Building itself is gone. Nothing is behind save for more jungle.\n\n“Where the hell? Where did it go?” you say.\n“It’s gone. We’re some place completely different and who knows where the hell that building is now. Shit…my head is still throbbing and all fucked up. I still don’t feel quite right. Just let me rest here a moment.” Jack says still sitting on the ground.\n\nYou look around and you have no idea where to go next. You look at the trees and ground and for all you know you’re in the Amazon. Certainly feels hot enough and you’re already starting to sweat.\n\n“Goddamn, it’s hot. Jack I’m going to tell you right now, I MIGHT be taking my shirt off at some point and I can only hope you’re a gentleman enough to keep your eyes at least focused on my face when you’re directly speaking with me.” You say.\n“Fuck, with the way I feel, I dunno if I’m even up for that sort of stimulation. Besides, I’m going to be keeping an eye on everywhere else given that we’re in a jungle. Ohhh, I really wished you went towards the snow, I got a bad feeling about this.”\n“What are the chances we’re on another Styrofoam island?” you ask.\n“Well, I dunno, but it still doesn’t change the fact we’re in a jungle where all manner of animals, bugs and plants can kill you. I guess we better pick a direction and hope we find friendly civilization.” Jack says and gets up.\n\nAs Jack gets up while you look around again and decide on a direction.\n\n“Well at least you’ve still got your axe and I got a bat. The jungle doesn’t look as heavy in that direction I suppose. Guess we’re going that way.” You say.\n“I suppose it’s as good as a direction as any.” Jack replies.\n\nYou and Jack begin your trek through the jungle…\n\nDespite the jungle not being as thick in this direction, it’s still not an easy walk. The only upside, is the canopy of the trees is at least shielding you from the sun directly. You can honestly say you don’t remember when the last time you had to deal with this sort of heat. All that time spent in the cool basement has made you a little less resistant to it you guess.\n\nJack and you continue to keep your eyes and ears open. So far you’ve not seen any signs of civilization, but at one point a small purple furry rodent like animal walks by and you can honestly say even with all the animal and nature shows you’ve seen, you’ve never seen something like this before. It sees you and squeaks causing you to raise your bat before it runs off.\n\n“What the hell was that?” you ask.\n“I dunno, looked like some sort of rat, but purple though.” Jack replies.\n“Well don’t you think a purple rat is a little strange?” you ask.\n“Well of course I do, but given that this is where the Gray Building sent us, is it really surprising?”\n“I don’t mean just that though. I mean before I thought that maybe we were at least still on our world. Weird looking purple rat like creatures aren’t exactly native there. Is it possible it sent us to some alien planet?”\n“Suzy, with the Gray Building anything is fucking possible.”\n\nIt’s at this moment you lose a little hope. Its one thing to possibly be lost in a jungle on Earth at least there would have been a slim chance of survival if you somehow made it to civilization. The idea of being on some sort of alien planet is a lot more disheartening.\n\n“Great, we are so fucked.” You say.\n“Probably, but we have to keep moving.”\n“What the hell’s the point? For all we know this whole damn planet is jungle and uninhabited and if it is inhabited I can’t imagine the natives are going to be friendly!” you exclaim.\n“We don’t know if this is an alien planet! I mean maybe we got transported back in time to the Mesozoic Era, we don’t know what the hell sort of creatures lived back then or what color they were.”\n“Oh, so we’re in the time of dinosaurs? Yeah, don’t think that’s any better.”\n\nJack at this point wipes his face and closes his eyes.\n\n“Suzy, it’s too hot for us to argue, but I told you I didn’t want to go to the jungle anyway!”\n“There it is. I told you so. Thanks. Real helpful. (Sigh) Okay, look I’m sorry I’m just…”\n\nAt this moment you hear a rustling noise and then a whizzing sound is heard just before blood splatters on you.\n\nJack looks down briefly to see the top of a spear through his chest. He coughs up blood and falls to his knees looking at you the whole time.\n\n“Oh shit Jack…” you utter and then another spear just narrowly misses your head and hits a nearby tree.\n\nThen you see your assailants coming out of the undergrowth. Several small bipedal lizard like creatures armed with spears. They’re not even as tall as you, but they certainty look more than capable of killing you. They hiss at you and one proceeds to finish off Jack who was already dying at that point.\n\nYou turn and run in the opposite direction ignoring the fact that you’re going to only get yourself further lost in the jungle, you have to escape these things. They screech and they run after you.\n\nAnother spear nearly hits you and despite the very real fear of death you’re experiencing, the only thing going through your mind is how you curse the day you went out to go get a real job. One day you were living comfortably in a basement and now you’re running through a hot ass jungle being chased by fucking lizard aliens.\n\nYou already know this isn’t going to end well for you. You’ve been pushing the odds ever since you left the damn basement, and it’s only a matter of time before those lizards get you and…\n\nSuddenly you feel a sharp bite to the side of your neck. It isn’t a spear. It’s some sort fauna that resembles a snake with legs. You didn’t even see it, but even if you hadn’t been so focused on running, you still wouldn’t have seen it due to its camouflage.\n\nThen before your eyes several of these creatures seemingly blink into existence and they’re all jumping on you and biting. You’ve just run into a nest of whatever these things are and you fall to their onslaught.\n\nThe only upside is their deadly poison kills you before they can start eating you alive.\n",
  "page 277": "As much as it might be tempting to go stay with Jack, you need to keep to your plan of self-sufficiency or at least an attempt at it. Staying with Jack is just a bad idea in the long term.\n\nWhile he might say he isn’t expecting anything, the longer you stay the more likely he’s going to get resentful and the more likely you’re just going to revert to your old ways. It’s a recipe for disaster. Jack and his Gray Building were pretty weird anyway, better you just put all of that out of your head right now.\n\nLiving with your sister and friend won’t be fun, but at least it will motivate you to get a means of employment to get the hell out of there quicker. It probably won’t even be as bad as you think it will be either.\n\nSo that’s it. You’ve made up your mind, set a goal and you’re going to stick to it. You actually feel a little good about that.\n\n“And fuck Peter, I’m keeping this damn car. Peter’s stolen enough of my clothing over the years that I already paid for his damn vehicle.” You mumble to yourself.\n\nNow you feel even better. So much so you’re smiling.\n\nWith your thoughts getting comfortable with risk and leaving behind thoughts of doing the “safe” thing you continue back to town.\n\nYou must drive for hours and never see another car on the road. It’s sort of eerie, especially as it starts to get dark. At least you don’t have to worry about traffic though.\n\nAs you get within the distance of the town, you wonder just how fucked up it’s gotten since you left, or if order has been restored. You remember Jake mentioned marshal law being enforced in cities across the country. Makes you sort of wonder if the whole damn world is going mad or something.\n\nJust as you get within the town’s limits, you think you notice a large vehicle up head and even people. Then suddenly several spotlights shine in the direction of your vehicle and one right ahead of you. You nearly lose control of your vehicle due to the blinding light and slam on your breaks.\n\n“HALT! BY THE ORDER OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THIS TOWN IS UNDER MARSHAL LAW! ALL ENTRY AND IN AND OUT IS FORBIDDEN! STOP YOUR VEHICLE FOR INSPECTION!” a loud speaker echoes.\n\nThe government has apparently decided to place your shithole town under marshal law as well, you can’t imagine why, but you aren’t even really thinking about that, all you’re thinking about is getting the hell out of here before you get shot, rounded up into a camp or both.\n\n“Christ, Suzy, you ARE fucking jinxed.” You say and then with a deft maneuver you reverse the car and spin it around. You then slam on the gas.\n\nGunshots ring out and your back window is shot out. Soon the sounds of a jeep can be heard followed by more gunfire.\n\nYour attempt to outrun the National Guard prove to be a failure as your back tires are shot and blown out causing your car to spin out of control, flip a few times and then slam into a row of tree along the side of the road.\n\nUnlike the last accident you got into, you aren’t quite as lucky and you are severely injured due to low hanging branches going right through the windshield and impaling you through the chest. By the time the guardsmen reach you, all they find is a bloody mangled corpse.\n",
  "page 155": "You sneak around towards the front end of the truck and then see Mr. passenger get out of the car.\n\n“Okay baby, where are we doing this? The back seat of the car is pretty full as you can see. We can do it in your truck if you want. Front seat or the bed of it. Doesn’t matter to me.” He says and then you come out from your hiding spot to blast him in the head.\n\n“OH SHIT MITCH GET BACK IN THE FUCKING CAR!” the driver shouts. He must’ve seen you in his rear view mirror and it’s distracting enough that you miss your shot allowing Mitch to duck and scramble for the cover of the car.\n\nAt this point Donna screams and runs off and you start firing into the car. You aren’t sure if you hit the driver or not, but the car starts going in reverse. Not at an excessively fast speed, but you barely get out the way.\n\nFalling back on your ass you watch as the car continues rolling past you with the driver slumped over the wheel.\n\nUnfortunately you aren’t able to celebrate this good fortune because while you were falling and trying to get out a rolling car’s way, Mitch ran around the front of the rolling car and around your truck to get the drop on you.\n\nYou recover just in time to see a sub-machine gun pointed at you and then the muzzle flash of multiple bullets ripping your skull apart.\n",
  "page 158": "While this place might very well not work out, you decide you need to at least make a go of it. Given that you turned to murder and banditry fairly quickly you think you need some semblance of law and order to keep yourself from becoming a complete savage, but more importantly you think Donna needs this more than you do.\n\nThis whole week, Donna’s been flip flopping a bit on the whole “trying to get her life together” thing. Granted she hasn’t had a great foundation, but if you stay on the road and just drift, about the only thing she’s ever going to be useful for is…well bait for whomever else you decide to rob in the future.\n\n“Hey Donna, I think we should stay here and by that I mean try to do what we were doing in the trailer park until we ran out like a pair of thieves.”\n“Suzy, you know that place wasn’t turning out good for us.”\n“Yeah, I know, that’s why I ultimately agreed with your plan to leave it…but I can’t help think that if we’d done things a little differently…well doesn’t matter. My point is, I think we BOTH need some structure.”\n“Structure? You’re joking right?”\n\nAt this point you grab Donna by the arm and go to speak to her away from the earshot of those nearby.\n\n“No Donna, I’m not fucking joking. Thursday, we stole a truck and killed two people who were just trying to stop us. Earlier today, we basically did the same thing except it was premeditated. You see a pattern emerging?”\n“Hey, I didn’t mean to run over that woman at the trailer park and I didn’t know you were going to kill those two guys with the car.”\n“Donna, don’t play the babe in the woods routine. Granted I’LL take the blame for murdering those guys in cold blood, but you knew damn well that it was a possibility. You went along with it.”\n“I went along with it, because you were practically shoving me in the road, telling me to strip to get those guys attention in the first place. It wasn’t YOU who had to role-play a pig on a spit to distract them. Besides, we had to do it for survival.”\n“And that’s my point. First we’re doing it for survival, how long before we start doing it for fun? I mean…(Sigh) I don’t know about you, but for the past few days, my mind has been going to a dark place. Quite frankly a place I didn’t think I had. I mean I’ve killed several people at this point and I don’t feel particularly bad about it. Like I don’t feel anything.”\n“Geez, Suzy…”\n“Yeah, I’m apparently more fucked up than I ever realized, but what about you? I mean you’ve relied on your looks and sex to get what you want for the most part. Do you really think that’s a great way to go through life? I even used you as slut bait so we could rip off someone a lot easier. Hell, I pretty much pimped you out and I think it’s the only thing fucked up thing I’ve done recently that I HAVE actually felt bad about doing on some level. You shouldn’t have to be taking random dicks in the ass and mouth just so we can get by. And I’m really sorry for that. We both NEED a better plan for our future and drifting from place to place isn’t it.”\n\nDonna’s silent for a moment.\n\n“But what would we do here? How would we contribute?”\n“I dunno, but I’m going to go talk to that Henry guy about it.” You say and then head over back to Henry who is overseeing his people taking all the shit out of your car.\n\n“Oh hey there…Suzy wasn’t it?” Henry remarks.\n“Yeah.” You answer.\n“Well Suzy, you’ll be happy to know we haven’t taken much, save for the couple of first aid kits you had. We got tons of food and water, so we really didn’t need any of that. Oh, didn’t take your weapons either. Got enough of those too.”\n“Um…thanks, but I wanted to talk to you about staying.”\n“Good, we could use the help, so what skills do you have?” Henry asks.\n“Well, I killed a lot of those cannibal freaks. I also had to kill a few regular psychos as well this week. Guess you could say I’ve become a fast learner in the ways of the gun…so do you need another lookout?”\n“Wouldn’t turn one down if you’re feeling up to the task. Not many here actually want to do it. Anyway, I’ll make sure to get you a rifle, but what about your sister? What’s she do?”\n\nBefore you can answer, your sister Donna has come up to speak for herself.\n\n“I’m a people person! I used to plan parties and other similar social events. Made sure people had a good time. Now while that might not sound very useful, I think given our current situation it could be. I mean I can’t imagine spirits around here are very high. And when spirits aren’t very high, everything else goes to shit. I think I could help out in making sure people stay positive.” Donna says with a chipper tone and a smile.\n\nHenry scratches his head and returns a brief grin.\n\n“Well now, that is an interesting proposal and I have to say you do have a pretty cheery attitude. You’re right in that everyone has been on edge and not in the best of moods. I’m really not sure how you propose to change that, but if you can do it, well that would be pretty helpful. Though you’re still going to have to do something else in the meantime, I think the wait staff in the diner needs help with going through the inventory. Go see Anne in the diner; she’ll be able to direct you. Okay, well that’s settled. You ready for your assignment Suzy?”\n“Yeah, hold on. Just want to talk to my sister for a moment.”\n“Sure.”\n\nOnce again you take Donna aside away from earshot.\n\n“Donna, what was all that about planning parties and shit?” you ask.\n“What? I did used to plan parties over Julie’s house remember?” Donna says.\n“I didn’t think you guys actually planned them so much as you just invited a bunch of people over.”\n“Well okay, yeah most of the time that was the case, but really I was the main one that got those parties going to be more exciting than they actually were. I also curbed the more destructive elements that actually occurred at those things by keeping people positive and happy.”\n“So…what? You’re going to turn this place into a rave orgy?”\n“No…well I mean I wish, but all I have to do is take my interpersonal skills and channel them in some way that will work here. Look, you said we need to try to start over. Well, I’m going to improvise with what I can so we can make a go of it here.”\n“You’re right Donna. Okay, well I’ll leave you to it.”\n\nBefore you leave, Donna moves in to hug you. You weren’t expecting it, but you return the hug.\n\n“Be careful Suzy, don’t get eaten.” Donna remarks.\n“Don’t worry about me, you just focus on what you need to do.” You say.\n\nWith those parting words, Donna heads towards the diner and you go back to Henry for your assignment.\n\nHenry apparently has already told some of his people that you’ll be joining them on the truck tops keeping a look out and hands you a rifle. Henry also mentions that this decision was met with mixed results. Some were happy since it meant they could take more breaks, others didn’t like the idea since nobody really knows who the fuck you are and don’t see why they should trust you yet. Still, Henry is pretty well respected you guess around here, because other than some grumbling nobody is outright making a major case out of it.\n\nHenry takes you to the far back end of the truck stop. He says he hasn’t really put many guards up here since its away from the road and borders the wilderness and so far nothing has come out from there yet, other than the occasional wildlife.\n\n“Now I don’t think anything actually will be coming up this way, since I imagine if we did have another cannibal attack they’ll be coming from one of the other directions, but hey we shouldn’t just keep our back completely undefended. Now you’ll be here until about midnight, I hope you’re up for that.” Henry remarks.\n“That’s what I’m here for.”\n“Hm. Well like I said, there probably won’t be much going on and about the most likely thing you’re going to have to fight off is boredom. Um, if you need to go bathroom, there are some port a johns nearby, though suppose if you REALLY need to, you can go run over to the diner if you’re a little more concerned with cleanliness, but whatever you do make sure you at least tell Larry over there so he can keep extra watch while you’re gone.” Henry points to a man over on top of a truck on the far side of where you are before continuing.\n\n“Anyway, that’s about it, and if you see anything that looks dangerous, yell your head off and warn us.”\n“Okay, got it.” You answer.\n\nYou climb up the ladder propped against the eighteen-wheeler and take you place as a guard.\n\nA few hours pass and just as predicted, nothing happens. You’re not really bored yet though since you’re taking a mental count of the number of rabbits you see hopping around in the field and making up little bunny names and little stories about their little bunny lives.\n\nEvery once in awhile while you’re walking back and forth along the truck, you wonder how your sister is doing. You also wave to Larry once in an attempt to be friendly, but he doesn’t return the wave and ignores you.\n\nEventually he has to pay attention when nature calls.\n\n“Hey Larry!” you shout.\n“What?!” he answers in an annoyed tone.\n“I gotta pee!”\n“So? Go over the side of the truck, its what I do when I gotta piss.”\n“Yeah, I’m not a guy and I don’t have the luxury of the world being my toilet. I need to use a proper bathroom. Henry told me to let you know so you can keep an extra eye on things until I get back.”\n“(Sigh) Fine, don’t fucking take all day though.”\n\nWith Larry’s acknowledgement of your bathroom needs, you go down the ladder and run to the diner. (You sure as hell aren’t going to use those disgusting port a johns)\n\nWhen you enter the diner, you find a variety of people singing songs and joking around. You then see Donna dressed in a waitress uniform wave to you.\n\n“Hey Suzy! You done with protecting all of us?! This is my sister Suzy folks! She’s the one that saved my life more than once this week!”\n\nAt this point everyone says hi to you.\n\n“Um…hey. I actually just came in to use the bathroom” You reply caught a little off guard.\n“That’s Suzy, always the social one.” Donna laughs and then goes back to talking to the crowd.\n\nAfter taking care of business in the bathroom, you wash your hands and see Donna entering the room.\n\n“Gotta hand it to you Donna, it hasn’t been a few hours and already you’ve got the people here in a good mood.” You say.\n“Yes, and I didn’t fuck all of them to get them that way in case that’s what you were thinking.” Donna says.\n“Sheesh, I saw some children out there. I know you’re not a degenerate Donna.”\n“Well, I’m glad you don’t think I am. Never thought I’d say this, but your opinion of me has started to matter more this week. So how’s guard duty?”\n“It is what it is. I’m not quite the people person you are though, so all I’ve managed to do is piss off the one person assigned near me. On the bright side, I’ve managed to stave off boredom by making up stories in my head about the bunnies bouncing around in the fields.”\n“Heh, well you always were the imaginative one. Well I’ll see you later.”\n\nYou leave your sister and return to your guard duty, which continues to be uneventful. As the night comes your stories about rabbits give way to stories about wandering possums and raccoons instead. Thankfully no cannibals though.\n\nEventually someone comes to relieve you of duty. Some guy you haven’t seen before, but at least he’s a little more cordial than Larry.\n\nYou return to the diner where you find most people now asleep. Donna is still awake and sitting behind the food counter playing solitaire. She waves you over.\n\n“Suzy, there you are. I waited up for you so I could show you where we’ll be sleeping. Come on.” Donna whispers and takes you through the back kitchen.\n\n“Hey you didn’t eat today did you? There’s a lot of food here you know. There’s also a shower in the waitresses’ private bathroom if you need.” Donna says.\n“Nah, I’m good for now. I’ll worry about that stuff tomorrow.” You reply.\n“Okay, well here it is.” Donna says and opens up a small storeroom, which doesn’t have much space.\n\n“I tried to make it as comfortable as possible with a few blankets I borrowed. There are our bags of clothing. I figured those might work as pillows of a sort.” Donna says.\n“Well I guess it will have to do.” You answer.\n\nYou lay down on the make shift bed on the floor and try to get as comfortable as possible. Donna does likewise and you drift off.\n",
  "page 157": "You decide that it would be best if they were completely pre-occupied. If you shoot now, the driver could either manage to drive off or the passenger could start spraying the place with bullets.\n\nStill, you sneak around towards the front end of the truck so you can at least ambush from behind when you do strike.\n\n“Okay baby, where are we doing this? The back seat of the car is pretty full as you can see. We can do it in your truck if you want. Front seat or the bed of it. Doesn’t matter to me.” The passenger says getting back out of the car.\n“Uh, no not the truck. It got all shot up yesterday, back window broke and there’s broken glass everywhere. Don’t want to potentially get cut up.”\n“Hmm, well the hood of this car then?”\n\nAt this point Donna walks up to him and starts to do what she does best. Namely act like a slut.\n\n“How about I do the both of you at the same time? That way you both get off and we can be on our way a lot quicker.” she says and starts rubbing up against Mr. passenger.\n“Well now. That’s an interesting suggestion…how were you proposing the logistics of this?”\n“Oh that’s easy… you see, first I take off my clothes…” Donna says and quickly takes her clothing off until she’s completely naked.\n\n“Next, I just get on my knees in this front seat here… and start to unbuckle your friend’s pants…”\n\nYou can’t see the driver from your position since he’s never moved out from his seat, but he’s obviously okay with this since you hear a couple of moans of pleasure.\n\n“And now…well don’t just stand there silly. My ass is right in front of you, start fucking!” Donna commands.\n“Wait, you want me to fuck you in the ass?!” Mr. passenger asks.\n“Well it’s not gonna fuck itself. Do what you want. I gotta concentrate on wrapping my lips around this nice hard cock…mmmmm…”\n\nHoly shit, talk about taking one for the team…hell taking TWO for the team.\n\nAt this point Mr. passenger can’t err on the side of caution any longer. He places his gun on the roof of the car and presumably starts taking your sister in a way that you imagine many men have taken her before.\n\nWith one dick in her mouth and another in her ass, you’re fairly confident now that Donna’s distracted them both to the point that you have the complete advantage.\n\nYou step out from the front of truck and walk towards the car parked near it. Mr. passenger’s eyes aren’t watching as he’s focused on thrusting into your sister. His head is a perfect target and with a single shot, you end him as a threat.\n\n“Oh shit! Oh shit! ARGH! MY DICK! FUCKING BITCH!” you hear the driver shout.\n\nYou rush over to the driver’s side and point the gun at his head before he can start beating on your sister’s head in an effort to get her off his dick.\n\n“You move to your hands to hit my sister and you die. You try to start up the car and you die. If you want your life AND your dick to stay intact then I suggest you follow my orders. First thing, car keys.”\n“OKAY OKAY! ARGH! JUST TELL HER TO STOP BITING MY DICK!” the driver shouts and hastily hands you his car keys.\n\n“Okay, that’s a start. Alright, Donna, you can release his dick now, I’ll take it from here.”\n\nDonna complies and then spits in the driver’s face before he staggers out of the car with his pants half down. You tell her to grab your bags from the truck and put them in the car.\n\n“Okay, we’re going to be taking this car and everything in it. In exchange, you can take our truck. Granted it has two flat tires and is low on gas, but if you’re lucky, you might just reach a trailer park that has lots of people willing to help you. You ready Donna?”\n“Almost.” Donna remarks.\n\nYou turn back to the driver who is still mostly holding on to his dick wincing in pain.\n\n“Okay, well I guess this is where we part ways. Thanks for the info about Security City. We’ll be sure to avoid going there…and uh…bye. Oh, and watch your head.”\n“Wha…?” is all the driver says before you shoot him and get in the car.\n\n“I thought you were letting him live.” Donna says.\n“What? And let a man who defiled my poor sister’s mouth walk away to brag about it? Not fucking likely.” You say and start the car up.\n\nAs you spin the car around to head back in your original direction, you ask Donna if she’s okay since she’s fidgeting a bit in her seat.\n\n“So…um, are you okay?” you ask.\n“I’m fine. It’s done. We worked together and we succeeded. I think we both know our established roles are in this team. We all have our talents. Let’s not talk about it.“ Donna says.\n\nShe doesn’t exactly sound angry, but she obviously isn’t leaping for joy about what she did. You almost want to talk more about what just happened, but given that your sister doesn’t you don’t press the issue and just drive.\n\nAs you’re driving, Donna suddenly speaks up again.\n\n“Next time, don’t fucking kill the guy while he’s still inside me. Tell him to move away or something first. I had a dead man’s dick shooting cum in my ass for a split second before he fell. I’ll admit to being a free spirited gal comfortable with my sexuality, but I didn’t want to include necrophilia in my list of things I’m willing to do.”\n\nWow. You didn’t really expect to hear that graphic detail. It’s actually a bit nasty and you can see why Donna’s in the mood she’s in.\n\n“Okay Donna. Damn, sorry about that. I wasn’t thinking.” You say.\n“Well like I said, it’s done. Let’s just not speak of it again. (Sigh) Probably for the best he didn’t go the traditional route or else he might’ve impregnated me when he shot his load and I might’ve given birth to zombie babies or some shit.” Donna remarks.\n\nThe situation is pretty fucked up, but you’re having a hard trying not to laugh now.\n\n“I don’t think it works that way Donna. Pretty sure you would’ve given birth to a normal baby.” You say with a stifled chuckle.\n“Yeah, well that would be just as bad.”\n\nYou decide not to make any more comments even though there’s a really twisted part of you that is finding this all pretty amusing and wants to make jokes. It’s almost like you’re sort of getting a kick out of Donna’s discomfort. Maybe it’s pent up hostility you’ve had for her due to how she’s acted towards you in the past. Maybe it’s some sort of sadistic side you’ve always harbored and it’s just recently come out due to this week’s events.\n\nIn any case, it’s slightly worrying to you, since you’re starting to wonder how far you’re going to start abandoning “civility.” You’ve already committed murder on several occasions, and while the first time was in self-defense, the ones following it have been getting progressively more predatory.\n\nA few more remorseless murders and you’re going to be just like your Uncle Ed. (Now you’re wondering if it’s genetic)\n\nYou and Donna continue to drive. A couple of other cars do pass you on the road. You imagine they must be coming from Security City or fleeing it from your previous information. You’re just glad you haven’t come across any military trying to block the road.\n\nYou continue to drive for about a half hour before you see something of interest in the distance. Namely a truck stop, which apparently has been converted into a minor fortress.\n\n“Well that’s interesting.” You say.\n“Is that a truck stop?” Donna asks.\n“Yeah I think so. Looks like whoever is there are trying to block the place off by putting trucks around it. They even got people standing on top of the trucks with rifles as lookouts. “ you say.\n“Are we stopping there?”\n“I dunno. Whoever is there probably isn’t going to be too trustful of anyone. Though, we still don’t have that much of long term plan. A place like this might be a safe haven of sorts. I mean it already looks way better defended than that trailer park.”\n“Well, it’s up to you. But I think we’re going to have to be more careful at a place like this.”\n“We might as well chance it if only to catch a breather and maybe get some directions because I can honestly say I don’t know where the fuck we are or where we should be going. That’s assuming they even let us in.”\n\nYou and Donna drive to the truck stop, which immediately causes the lookouts to point and raise their rifles in your direction. When you stop in front of it, there are a lot of shouts for you to stay in the car.\n\n“We’re not just letting anyone in here. Who are ya, and state yer business!” the lookout from above shouts.\n“Just a couple poor souls trying to escape the chaos out there! Our home town was overrun by military and crazy people. We’ve also been attacked by others who would try to take advantage of us. Please, we’re just looking for some sort of refuge even if it’s temporary. We got some supplies in our car.”\n“Hrmmm, well whatta you got?”\n\nYou turn your head to look in the back seat to actually see what you “inherited” since you never looked before. You see a first aid kit on top of a pile of bags.\n\n“Um…we got some medicine. Maybe that could help?” you say.\n\nThere is a long pause and he tells you to wait before climbing down the truck and disappearing from sight. Eventually you hear his voice again which is now coming from behind the truck barricade.\n\n“Okay, we’re gonna move this truck, but one funny thing happens and you’re the first one getting a bullet to the head. Alright, we’re letting this one in, everyone keep extra look out for those rabid bastards!”\n\nAs soon as the truck is moved out your way, the man who was barking orders at you waves you in and motions you over to a parking spot with some other cars. As soon as you drive in they put the truck back. Either they’re really safety conscience or they don’t want to risk having you get away.\n\n“Well let’s hope these people are just normal people trying to survive and aren’t a gang of rapists.” You remark.\n\nFrom this distance you see several more people in the building part of the truck stop. Looks like it’s a general store/diner combo. Most of them are watching you from the windows, though a few of them come out, one of them is an older man with a cane who walks directly towards the car.\n\n“Okay, I want the two you in that car to exit it slowly. I don’t care if you got weapons, but don’t point them at me or anyone else in a threatening manner.” The old man shouts.\n\nYou take your pistol and shove it in the front of your pants. As for your newly acquired sub-machine gun, you just leave it in the car when you and Donna exit it. Naturally rifles are pointed at the pair of you, but the old man with the cane shouts telling them to calm down.\n\n“You lot, stop pointing your guns and start unloading the car. Sorry about that, everyone’s a little on edge. Name’s Henry. I own this place.” He says.\n“My name’s Suzy, and I get it.”\n“So what are two pretty young girls doing driving around in this mess?”\n“Long story, but I’ll just say, my sister and I are grateful for the shelter if only for awhile.”\n“Hm, think nothing of it. Really though, if you two are willing to pull yer weight around here, yer welcome to stay as long as you like. Right now we’ve got plenty of supplies and whatever useful supplies you have can be considered payment for your way in here.”\n“Well, that’s certainly an offer to think about, but I’m not exactly sure what we’d do around here.” You answer.\n“We can find something I’m sure. Anyway, I just mention it because I’ve been trying to contact various places on my Ham Radio, and all I can gather is what’s been going on is pretty serious and I’m not sure if there’s any place I could direct you where to go that would be as safe as this place right now. Security City is completely overrun and the closest military Fort around here, Fort Timons doesn’t even know what the fuck is going on other than the obvious. Besides, I don’t think you’d get in there anyway, not being military and all.”\n“This place is really safe huh?” you ask.\n“Well not to brag, but we just fended off a big horde of those rabid freak things that I imagine wandered from the city yesterday. Didn’t even lose anyone either. Wasn’t fun though and I’m glad no more of those things have popped up, but yeah, I think we’re doing good job of keeping this place safe. Anyway, you’re good to stay for the night, unless you let me know you want to stick around longer and we’ll find something for the both of you to do. Okay, I’m going to go make sure these boys don’t take EVERYTHING of yours in that car.” Henry says and then walks over to oversee his people unloading your car.\n\nWell it’s a similar situation you had in the trailer park. Pull your weight or get the hell out. Funny how that worked out.\n\nMaybe you could try to do the “community” thing again. The trailer park wasn’t exactly filled with welcoming people, maybe things here could be different and you could actually feel safe here. This place does seem a little better organized and definitely better defended. Really, the only reason why you left the trailer park to begin with was at the insistence of your sister and the fact that it was getting pretty dangerous there.\n\nThen again, this place could turn out to be just as bad where you don’t get along with anyone and everything eventually turns into a cluster fuck. Maybe you might as well save yourself the bother by leaving tomorrow.\n",
  "page 278": "You suddenly slam on the breaks.\n\n“What the fuck am I doing? I don’t really want to go back to that shithole town! I don’t want to deal with shit on my own! Fuck this!” you exclaim and then spin the car around.\n\nYou drive back justifying everything in your mind that this isn’t really abandoning your goal of being self sufficient, it’s just a minor set back.\n\n“You’re not going back to your old ways Suzy, you just need to some help. Jack wants to help so why shouldn’t you let him help? There’s no shame in it. Besides, you’re not going to whore yourself out and he’s not expecting you to. Everything is going to be fine.” You say to yourself.\n\nAfter several times of thinking this, you have probably managed to convince yourself of it to a minor degree.\n\nEventually as day turns to night you see the Gray Building looming in the distance.\n\n“Besides, it’s very dangerous in town right now. It’s probably safer to stay here anyway. Yeah, it will be safer…” you say ignoring the fact that you’ll be completely alone with a perfect stranger in the middle of nowhere. Well actually you aren’t really ignoring it, so much as you’re trying to mentally block it out.\n\nYou park near the building, get out of the car and head to the door. Remembering that Jack told you to knock three times, you do so and the door opens. Jack isn’t at the door, but you assume he’s probably got it on some sort of automatic system.\n\nYou enter the large front room and shortly after the door closes, you see Jack exiting one of those rooms in the back and quickly walking towards you.\n\n“Suzy! Are you alright?! You’re not hurt are you?” He asks.\n“Um, I’m fine Jack. I just decided that you might be right about how dangerous the town is right now and I should stay here awhile just to play it safe. No point in being proud for no reason.” You say.\n“So you never actually got back to town?” Jack asks.\n“No, why?”\n“Because the town is currently under marshal law as well. After fucking around with the radio a bit more, I managed to get a little more info on that military frequency. My heart sank when I heard it knowing you were probably heading back that way. To be honest, I really worried.”\n\nIf Jack’s playing up his concern, he’s doing a really good job because you’re fairly convinced he’s being genuine.\n\n“Well…I guess its good I decided to come back then.” You say realizing that this happy coincidence is only going to reinforce your more slothful tendencies. Still, you ARE glad you avoided potentially getting shot by the National Guard or something.\n\nAttempting to avoid awkward silence you move on to a topic of immediate need.\n\n“So, you got a shower I can use? I think I’m about due.”\n“Sure, you know that room you woke up at? Well there’s a bathroom on that same side of the corridor towards the end of it, can’t miss it mainly because it actually has a door on it. Plenty of unused towels too…um, I don’t really have any spare women’s clothing lying around though. Not that I remember anyway. I suppose anything’s possible with all the shit I have laying around.”\n“Well I’ll just wear these and figure that out later. I also just realized I haven’t eaten anything since Monday.”\n“Oh, there’s a kitchen area across from the bathroom conveniently enough. Help yourself to whatever in the cupboards or refrigerators. Got plenty of stuff. I can even try to cook for you if you tell me what you like.”\n“You can cook?”\n“Well, I’m not an expert, but I can get by. I’m mostly lazy though and just pop in a frozen dinner.”\n“Same here and that’s what I’ll probably do. No need to trouble yourself.” You answer.\n“Okay, well I guess I’ll leave you to it. Oh, and you’re welcome to use that room to sleep in again. I think that’s it, if you need me I’ll be messing about with my radio as usual.”\n\nAt this point Jack raises his arm in a gesture to invite you back to his home.\n\n“Thanks Jack.” You say as you walk by.\n“I’m just glad you’re safe.” Jack says.\n\nYou head to the bathroom, which is a fairly mundane one with all the usual amenities. Plenty of towels like Jack said. You lock the door and take a much-needed shower. You get a half paranoid thought that Jack is going to suddenly burst in on you, but that doesn’t happen. So far Jack is still staying true to his gentleman form.\n\nYou get dressed and then head to the kitchen where you find Jack wasn’t kidding about having a well stocked one. You grab a drink and find the frozen dinner that takes the least amount of time to heat up in the microwave and then eat. Once again you think Jack is going to come in to check on you, but he doesn’t.\n\nAfter eating you sort of just sit in the kitchen looking around for a moment. That of course becomes boring fairly fast and you go back to your assigned bedroom, which looks about the same as it did before.\n\nIt isn’t any more interesting in there either. Normally, you would’ve had your laptop to keep you occupied, but it’s sadly back home and you’re unlikely to see it anytime soon. Even your phone has recently gone dead. You almost want to go through the dresser in the room, but you sort of think that would be a bit intrusive since it’s probably just filled with Jack’s things.\n\nLacking any other ideas, you try to go to sleep, but you’re just not tired yet. Not to mention you’re still too anxious about sleeping here. Your usual method of “easing” yourself to sleep, isn’t an option since for one thing your battery powered boyfriend is also at home. However, even if you wanted to take matters into your own hands, you’d rather not be in the middle of spittin’ the kitten if Jack does decide to walk in to check on you.\n\nSo you do the very thing that’s you’ve been expecting Jack to do to you, you go seek him out to see what he’s doing. (The irony isn’t lost on you)\n\nHe mentioned he would be in that radio room so that’s where you initially head to, but then you hear a few noises in another one of the side rooms. Sounds like a video game.\n\nYou take a look and see a proper living room like area. Odd that you didn’t notice it the first time you were here, but then you weren’t really paying excessive attention to every room you were passing last time.\n\nThere sitting on a sofa is Jack playing a video game on a sizable screen.\n\n“Well I guess you got sick of listening in on the military huh?” you ask causing Jack to look in your direction.\n“Oh hey, I thought you’d be asleep or something.” Jack says pausing his game.\n“Can’t sleep and I left any sort of stimulus to keep myself entertained at home unfortunately. This looks promising though.” You say.\n“Got another controller, you can join right in if you want.” Jack says and points to some controllers on his coffee table.\n“Nah, that’s okay. I’ll just watch for now.” You say and just as you’re about to sit on the sofa, Jack starts to get up.\n\n“How come you’re getting up?” you ask when you sit down.\n“Well I can sit in that seat over there.” Jack says.\n“Jack it’s your home, no need to move on my account. I’m fully comfortable sitting next to you. I need to get over my paranoid scenarios about you anyway.”\n“Scenarios?” Jack asks while sitting back down.\n“Yeah, I kept thinking you were going to come rape me in the shower.”\n“Yikes. I thought you said you didn’t think I was a serial killing rapist anymore.” Jack says not taking offense and going back to his game.\n“Yeah, but…well I can’t help thinking the worst of people.”\n“Well I get that.”\n“If it helps, I’m about ninety nine percent sure that you aren’t a serial killing rapists anymore and I just think there is something weird about you.”\n“Well looks like I’m doing better then.” Jack says with a smile.\n\nYou watch Jack kill something on screen before he speaks again.\n\n“Well Suzy, I’m not sure if this is going to disappoint you, but I’m going to admit something to you that I’ve never told anyone before.” Jack says.\n“Uh oh.” You say.\n“I’m completely boring. Seriously, there is nothing remarkable about me at all. Like I said, I mainly kept to myself and lived in my mom’s basement until she tragically died, then I lived alone in her house…and now I live here. The end. Oh and collected a bunch of shit along the way.”\n“Wow, way to sell yourself to me there Jack.” You say.\n“Well I figure if saving your life a couple times and being honest isn’t going to get you to like me, nothing will.” Jack chuckles, causing you to snicker a bit too.\n“Hah, I knew that’s why you saved me.” You say.\n“Oh well, I guess the secret’s out.” Jack replies.\n\nYou have to admit, you’re starting to become more at ease with Jack, the guy is very laid back and you’re certainly not used to dealing with that sort of personality. The closest was your older brother Ben’s hippy wife Moonshadow and she was an annoying flake. (She did have pretty eyes though)\n\n“So am I actually going to learn anything more about you?” Jack asks.\n“You know what Jack? I think you will, what the hell…” you say.\n\nYou open up to Jack, and begin telling him of your life. The funny thing is while you find it pretty dull Jack finds it pretty fascinating. You imagine that’s probably due to your “colorful” family members who probably would be a lot more amusing to someone else not having the burden of dealing with them.\n\nJack stops playing his game altogether when you start going into your Uncle Ed and Bobby. He hangs on every word, asking you for clarification at times which you provide.\n\nYou don’t know why you’re telling him all this stuff, you suppose it’s because you feel very comfortable with him, not to mention telling him all this stuff almost feel like a weight has been lifted off of you, since it isn’t like you talk to anyone normally.\n\n“Holy shit Suzy. Your life wasn’t all that boring what with all the psycho family members and your cultist ex. Wow. Maybe I should be scared of you given how you managed to survive it all.” Jack says after hearing everything.\n“Eh, seems like someone’s always saved me or I’ve been lucky. I mean Bobby saved me from my uncle. That’s probably why I fell in love with him…(Sigh) Sort of fucked up right?”\n“Well I think I understand it. I dunno, never been in that position myself, so I’m not really one to judge. Obviously it was love while it lasted. I mean he didn’t try to kill you when you broke up.”\n“True. So how about you?” you ask though you’re starting to get sleepy.\n“How about me what?” Jack says.\n“Any long lost loves in your life?”\n“Not really any love whatsoever really…it’s a rather depressing tale. I’d rather keep the conversation upbeat.”\n“Mm. Shit, wave of sleep is starting to hit me.” You say and then yawn.\n\n“Are you going to bed?” Jack asks.\n“You mind if I just sleep on this sofa? I think I mentioned how I’m used to sleeping on one.” You reply.\n“Sure. Sure. I’ll move and you just stretch out and be comfortable.” Jack says and gets up so you can lie down fully.\n\nJack turns off his console and as you settle in to sleep you continue to speak a bit.\n\n“I like you Jack.” You say.\n“I like you too Suzy…um…I feel I should tell you something though since you were so open with me.”\n“What, you’re a serial killer rapist after all? Well, if I’m still alive tomorrow, I think I’ll be able to look past the raping if you at least still respect me.” You darkly joke as sleep continues to creep up on you.\n“No, I just was going to say, while I wasn’t lying about not being a remarkable person, I suppose I’ve acquired some remarkable things in my dealings.”\n“Oh, well you can tell me all about your rare antiques tomorrow. I’m sure I’ll find it interesting.”\n“Well, I suppose I do have some of those, but I was referring to this building actually…um…I guess I’ll tell you tomorrow since it’s really important you know and I think you’ll want to be attentive when you hear it.” Jack says in a serious tone.\n“Sure…whatever (Yawn)…” you say.\n\nWith those last words Jack leaves you to sleep and you drift off…\n",
  "page 159": "You and Donna have been through this song and dance once before, no point in doing it again. Still there’s no reason to not take advantage of an opportunity here. You pull Donna aside away from earshot of everyone.\n\n“Hey Donna, I think we should only stay the night, but I’m also thinking we could gather a few more supplies here.”\n“Wait, really? This place isn’t like the trailer park. We won’t be able to get out so easily.”\n“Well that’s why we’re going to case this place. Or rather I’M going to case this place and YOU are going make friendly with the guards.”\n\nDonna looks at you like “really?”\n\n“What? You said I had my talents and you had yours. You know the drill.”\n“Yeah, I guess. Teamwork and all that…whatever. Just let me know who needs to be fucked and when.”\n“I’m going to go talk with Henry again and try to assess this situation. We can make a better plan soon.”\n\nYou leave Donna and head back to Henry who is overseeing his people taking all the shit out of your car.\n\n“Oh hey there, Suzy wasn’t it?” he says.\n“Yeah. Decided we’re only going to stay the night Henry. We’ve got family in another county and we should at least try to reach them to see if they’re okay.” You lie.\n“Well I can understand that…hmmm. Tell ya what; you can keep everything in your car. Actually we were just going to take the first aid kits, but I was sort of hoping you’d stick around to help out. Since you aren’t I don’t think it would be right for us to take what little medical supplies you do have. Especially since you’ll have a dangerous journey ahead.”\n\nAt this point Henry motions one of his people carrying the medical kits to put them back in the car. And with this act of kindness, you think you see your opportunity.\n\n“That’s really generous Henry. Thank you. Hey is there any place we can wash up?” you ask.\n“Well there is a small shower in the waitresses’ private bathroom. Just tell Anne I said you could use it. As for your sleeping arrangements, well I guess one of the booths or floor will have to do. Of course you could sleep in your car if you want.” Henry replies.\n“Hey, it’s better than we could’ve hoped for. Thanks again.”\n\nAt this point you part ways with Henry and return to Donna.\n\n“Okay, new plan. An hour from now I want you to grab one of those medical kits in the car and go see Henry. Tell him a story about how you really think we should pay to stay here and you insist that he take a kit.”\n“Wait, you want me to fuck that old guy?”\n“Well if you have to, but I’m thinking he’s probably got a key to where he keeps all the medicine locked up. Find out where that is, steal the key and later on in the night we can raid it. Then when the morning comes we leave before anyone finds out.”\n“I dunno Suzy, that sounds pretty risky. In fact it sounds pretty dumb. Shouldn’t we just, I dunno pilfer the kitchen during the night? Seems like it might be easier.”\n“Yeah and there’s going to be a shitload of people sleeping in that diner too. Talk about your dumb ideas.”\n“Maybe we shouldn’t steal anything. I mean that old guy didn’t even take our medkits as payment and is letting us stay here for free. I mean that’s pretty cool.”\n“(Sigh) Fuck Donna, how the hell are you ever going to survive in this world if you don’t seize opportunity when you see it? Fine, you know what, fuck the plan. Why don’t you just go blow as many guys as you can and hand me what you manage to steal off of them okay? That seems like it might be your speed.” You say angrily and begin to walk away.\n\nHowever you’ve pushed Donna a little too far this time and she pushes back, literally when you feel a heavy shove causing you to nearly fall over.\n\n“Oh fuck you Suzy! FUCK YOU! You think you can look down upon me like I’m some sort of gutter whore? You’re no fucking better than I am! You’re a goddamn murderer!”\n\nAt this point Donna’s yelling loud enough for others to hear and now people are looking.\n\n“Tell the whole fucking world Donna. And if I’m a murderer then you’re one right along side with me! Who’s idea was it to steal that fucking truck in the first place? You ran over someone, you stupid whore!” you laugh.\n“Stop calling me that!”\n“Fuck you, it’s the truth. It doesn’t matter where you go or where you are, you’ll always be a goddamn cum guzzling slut trying to fill some void that can never be filled.”\n\nAt this point Donna is screaming and tears are running down her face as she starts going on a tirade about your own shortcomings. You aren’t really listening though, it’s like your mind is going to a different place. A dark place that’s telling you to shut her whore mouth shut.\n\nAnd so you act upon this feeling and pull your pistol shooting Donna.\n\nAt first she looks down at her body wound and then back at you in shock. There are no last words she just falls backwards dead.\n\nYou stand there for a moment in a little disbelief of what you’ve done. You look at your pistol and then Donna’s body. Meanwhile several of Henry’s people are pointing their rifles at you, telling you to drop the gun. You aren’t really listening to them either though.\n\nWhen you fail to comply, one of Henry’s people decides to play it safe and drops you with a shot to your head.\n",
  "page 280": "THURSDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to the sound of…well you can’t quite place it. White noise might be the closest thing you can think of, but that wouldn’t be correct. It’s like an annoying hum or buzz going straight to your head. You get up and see that the TV is off from yesterday, so it isn’t that.\n\n“Jack? You hear that noise?” you call out in a groggy tone.\n\nThere isn’t any answer, just that increasingly annoying noise.\n\nYou attempt to get up and it takes you a couple tries, not because you’re naturally lazy, but more because you’re starting to feel nauseous. The noise you’re hearing isn’t helping matters.\n\nYou get up on your feet and stagger to the door way which when you get to, you lean up against and feel like you’re going to puke.\n\n“Jack…” you just barely manage to shout, before you have to stop to keep from vomiting.\n\nYou look up and down the corridor and find that the lights are flickering. Some are out completely. You have no idea what the hell is going on, but you’d probably be more scared if you didn’t feel so sick.\n\nMustering up all your willpower, you head to the bedroom thinking Jack might be asleep in there. Nobody there, but you can’t fight the sickness any longer and you run as fast as you can to the bathroom nearly falling over in the process.\n\nYou just barely manage to make it to throw up in the toilet. The lights are going nuts at this point and you notice the bathtub and sink are both on. After recovering a bit, you notice the stuff coming out of the sink isn’t exactly water. It’s black and tarry looking. You don’t risk touching it, you just get the hell out of the bathroom.\n\nNo sooner have you done this, when a sudden loud noise hits you so hard you actually stumble and fall to the floor. You wouldn’t even be able to describe the sound, it’s just really horrible and even though you’ve just puked, you still feel pretty damn nauseous.\n\nPicking yourself back up and leaning against the wall, you slowly try to make your way to the room where Jack was messing about with his radio stuff. You don’t feel like you’re getting anywhere though, in fact the more you walk, the more you feel like you’re on a treadmill in an endless corridor.\n\nYou continue on, but as you pass by rooms you can swear you’re seeing weird things out the corner of your eye. You then start thinking you’re seeing shit in front of you as well. Shadowy humanoid figures blink in and out existence along with the lighting.\n\nAt this point the feeling of terror is becoming stronger than your feeling of sickness. The white noise is still drilling into your head, but now it’s accompanied by an insane laugh, which varies in pitch and tone. When you pass the flight of stairs, you hear whispery voices beckoning you go in that direction. You’re hardly enticed to do so.\n\nAs you get closer to the radio room, the shadowy figures can be seen running about in the large room up ahead. As you get closer, these figures are becoming less shadowy and more “solid.” These figures are starting to no longer look humanoid either.\n\nIt is around this time that you notice your surroundings are becoming… warped. Walls are melting around you and you’re seeing those shadowy figures in the next room starting to move in slow motion one moment and then other times you see them rapidly moving back and forth in a repetitious manner. You nearly jump out of your skin when several of these beings appear right in front of you and you get a good look at them now that they aren’t so shadowy anymore.\n\nThey’re a mass of tentacles, teeth and misshaped features that would make any horror movie demon jealous, unfortunately this is no movie. The screeching, wailing, and gibbering are bad enough, the visual is bad enough, but the fetid smell is what puts it over the top in just vile nastiness.\n\nYou see one particularly disgusting one with a mutilated face like raw meat and a the scent of a rotten corpse on a hot day, transform into something even worse looking before it opens three of its mouths to reveal its tongues which not only look infested with disease, but have ugly little faces on them.\n\nWhen it attempts to lick you, you turn and run only to find yourself in a wide open space where everything now looks like it’s been put through a multicolored filter. You feel like you’re in a rainbow void. When you look behind you however all you see is darkness save for the creatures now moving towards you.\n\nYou don’t run far when all of a sudden the rainbow filter disappears and is replaced by a flickering affect that you’re actually back in a “real” location. It isn’t the corridor though, it resembles more of a large college auditorium and in the center is a single figure sitting in a lotus position.\n\nHe’s bald and not dressed in modern clothing and in fact looks like he’s from some sort of nerd cosplay convention. He appears human however.\n\nOne thing that’s about him that doesn’t look human though is his eyes are completely white and not just normal “blind eyes” sort either. They’re glowing pure white light.\n\nYou become very disorientated as the flickering of this reality disappears and slowly just becomes a blank gray open space with more gray as far as you can see despite there not being any more walls. You see that the creatures behind you aren’t following, but they definitely want to get closer. It would seem this man’s presence is at least holding them back somehow. At this point you you’re completely lost to as what is going on, but you approach the man if it means keeping the monsters at bay.\n\nThe man suddenly speaks as you get close to him. He’s not really looking at you though, more like looking through you.\n\n“You…I…don’t belong here…everything changes…so many changes…been here…before…somewhere else…so much to do…bring balance…the future is beautiful…the past is beautiful…everything is ugly…corrupted…it’s beautiful…” the man utters in a fragmented way and you have no idea what the hell he’s talking about.\n“Where is Jack?! What’s going on? Who are you?!” you ask trying to figure out this situation.\n\nTo your horror you notice your hands and arms become weathered and wrinkled. From what you can tell, your hair has gone completely white as well. With some hesitation, you feel your face and it definitely doesn’t feel smooth anymore.\n\n“Oh my god…” you utter.\n\n“…time is short…fleeting life…the others do not like this place…disrupts balance…” the man says still not moving from his spot.\n\nYou then notice your hands and everything else have gone back to normal. This entire situation is very fucked up, and you don’t have the faintest idea what’s going on, but you hope that “Mr. Lotus” has some answers with all the cryptic shit he’s spouting.\n\n“Look! I need answers! What is going on here and who are you?!” you ask again while still looking back to make sure those creatures are still staying away from you.\n\n“A footnote…forgotten… traveller…cursed…blessed…nobody… you must choose… Suzy…” the man utters.\n“How did you know my…” you start to ask before you’re interrupted.\n“You must choose…the others…they come…”\n\nYou turn your head and see that the monsters and the darkness are indeed starting to move towards you once again.\n\n“Choose? Choose what?! What are you talking about?!” you ask again.\n“You must choose…” the man says again with less of an air of indifference and more of one of authority.\n“What am I choosing?”\n\nThe area surrounding you and the man begins to darken and now you’re getting creatures starting surround you as well.\n\n“You must choose or die…” the man says again.\n“Alright! Alright! I choose! But what the fuck am I choosing!?!” you shout with a mixture of fear and frustration.\n“You’ll know when the time comes…” the man says.\n\nFor a brief moment your surroundings change from that of the large classroom auditorium again with the man still in front of you. The blackness has disappeared, but the monsters have not as you see several floating tentacle creatures in the room with you. They aren’t quite as disgusting, but they’re still dangerous and giving off that aura that’s making you feel nauseous again.\n\nJust as you think you see a more humanoid figure enter the room there is suddenly a blinding flash all around you causing you to shield your eyes. Everything goes completely white, to completely black and then when you open your eyes again, you find yourself in the large front room of the building. Items are no longer neatly stack and are instead scattered about all over the place, some of them probably broken.\n\nStill completely baffled by what the fuck is going on, you look around for something to protect yourself with amongst the junk all over the floor. You eventually see a sturdy looking bat and pick it up. Upon inspection you notice the words “RUTH” on it, no doubt one of Jack’s valuable purchases.\n\nSpeaking of Jack you still haven’t seen him, but you soon hear him.\n\n“Suzy?! Suzy? Are you here? Where are you?” you hear him call out. Sounds like it’s coming from the corridor, but you don’t see anyone. Maybe he’s upstairs? You haven’t been up there yet, but given what you just experienced, you’re a little reluctant to go deeper into this place.\n\nYou remember Jack said he was going to tell you something about this building before you fell asleep, well whatever that was, it’s apparent that you were right that something about him was weird. Not just weird, but dangerous.\n\nYou don’t think you’re ever going to quite get some of the images out of your head, you even feel a little different. Maybe the sensory overload has made you a bit numb rather than reducing you to a gibbering wreck.\n\nNumb or not, you still have a good mind to just walk out the front door and get the hell out of here.\n\nMaybe this was the “choice” that strange guy was talking about.\n",
  "page 161": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a body spooning you, and an arm holding you tightly around your mid-section.\n\n“Donna! Hey! Wake the fuck up!” you shout pushing your sister off of you.\n“Huh? Wha? The hell are you pushing and hitting me for?” she exclaims groggily.\n“Because you were about to commit incest that’s why!” you exclaim.\n“Oh. Sorry. It wasn’t intentional I assure you. I probably was dreaming about Julie.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Well one time over her house her heating system broke down and we had to sleep together for warmth for a week.”\n“Okay, I don’t want to know anymore about your little lesbian encounters with Julie.” You say.\n“Oh geez Suzy don’t be so heteronormative, we weren’t lesbians. We just had some fun on occasion. (Sigh) I wish she was here with us.” Donna says getting a little tearful.\n\nYou pat Donna on the shoulder.\n\n“I wish she was here too Donna.” You say.\n\nAfter that moment of silence to remember your friend, the both of you get up.\n\n“You know what time it is?” Donna asks.\n“No, but I know it’s time for me to take a shower. You said I can use the waitresses’ private one?” you say.\n“Yeah, but you might have to wait for other people.”\n“Damn, speaking of waitresses, what’s with the uniform?”\n“Oh this? Well I needed to change my clothes yesterday and I was offered one of their uniforms. I figured I’d wear it to fit in a little better, besides its kind of cute don’t you think?” Donna asks.\n“It’s kind of stripperish if you ask me. The skirt barely covers your ass.” You reply.\n“Well I think that’s the point. This is a truck stop remember and they probably want the waitresses to look a little more on the sexy side.”\n“Hm, well I’ll stick with my old non-stripper clothes.”\n“Prude.” Donna snarks.\n\nAs you and Donna leave the storage room to start the new day you both suddenly hear a loud noise and a faint rumble. You then hear some screams and shouting from the front of the diner.\n\n“Oh my god that was a fucking nuke!” you hear someone shout.\n\nYou and Donna just look at each other. Maybe its due to the week you’ve had, you’re not entirely phased by this.\n\n“(Sigh) I guess they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“Perfect way to start the day.” Donna replies and the pair of you head to the front of the diner.\n\nWhen you get there, you see a waitress trying to calm her children down. A couple people are arguing. A few are just sitting in a silent state of shock. Henry is actually outside the diner looking in the direction of where the bomb must’ve gone off. You can see the lingering remnants of a mushroom cloud in the far distance even from inside the diner.\n\n“Well I can only hope we’re far enough away that we aren’t suffering from horrible radioactive fallout.” You say.\n“Yeah, I suppose not much can be done now if we are, just um…shoot me if my hair starts falling out okay?” Donna asks.\n\nYou briefly wonder if this bomb was the result of the nuclear war those Ground Zero ads kept harping on about or if this was just some internal thing to take care of those rabid people.\n\nEither way, you suppose it doesn’t really matter, life is going to be severely different from now on.\n\nAt this point Henry steps back in the diner and after calming some of the arguing truckers. He begins addressing the situation and stating that nothing has changed and that the situation is still the same, namely if people help, then they are welcome to stay. If not or if they don’t want to stay then they are free to go.\n\nA couple of the truckers who apparently have families elsewhere do leave. Everyone else stays and the work towards creating a permanent new “home” is begun.\n\nAfter washing up and having something to eat, you head out to do your guard duty rounds. Donna comes to see you before you leave.\n\n“Hey, Suzy.”\n“Yes?” You answer.\n“Whatever happens next, I just want to say…I’m glad we’re dealing with all this together.”\n“I’m glad we’re seeing this through together too.” You say.\n\nAnd with those words, you and Donna hug and go contribute in your various jobs in this new community.\n\nFunny that it took the collapse of society before you re-connected with your family again.\n",
  "page 282": "Maybe this isn’t a good idea, but considering Jack did save your life a couple times, it seems like a pretty shitty thing to do if you just left him.\n\nWith bat in hand, you head towards back to the corridor and call out to Jack.\n\n“Hey Jack! Are you upstairs?” you say.\n“Suzy? Yeah! I’m up here! Be careful though, there’s still a bunch of weird shit going on.”\n\nNot terribly descriptive or encouraging. Weird shit could literally be anything, and in this case probably is.\n\nYou head towards the stairs and go up for the first time. As you going up, you have this fear that you’re going to start sinking into them, that doesn’t happen and when you arrive to the top, you find yourself exiting into a corridor that’s laid out very much the same way as the first floor, the only difference is you’re across from another set of stairs on the opposite side.\n\nYou look to your right and hear some noise causing you to ready your bat, though you soon see Jack exiting room of the side rooms.\n\n“Suzy! I’ve been looking all over for you.” He says approaching with an axe in hand.\n“Hey! Keep your distance!” You shout and raise your bat\n“What?” Jack asks as he stops in his tracks.\n“Sorry, it’s just, well there has been as you put it, a lot of weird shit going on and for all I know you’re some horrible monster. Not to mention you’re coming at me with an axe in hand, though I suppose given the shit I’ve already encountered, you probably wouldn’t have bothered to even stop.” You reply lowing the bat.\n“Well, you probably were best to err on the side of caution. I’ve just spent what I believe to be an hour or two looking for you.” Jack says.\n“I was in your living room downstairs asleep on your couch. Right where you left me last night.” You reply.\n“Yeah, and you weren’t there when I checked on you later this morning. I called out and looked in every room on the first floor. I heard your voice coming from the second floor so I went up there and that’s when things started getting weird. (Sigh) and I thought this place was done with all that…should have known better I suppose…”\n\nJack trails off, but at this point you’re demanding an answer.\n\n“Jack, you’ve saved my life twice, but if I’m going to hang out with you, you better start explaining what the hell’s going on with this place. I’m not sure what weirdness you’ve experienced up here, but what I just experienced downstairs was beyond weird, it was fucking terrifying.” You exclaim.\n“I know. I know. I should have told you about this place yesterday. Well let’s head into this room and talk about it.”\n\nJack heads into a room down the corridor and to the left. You follow and find that it’s another living area furnished in a similar manner as the one downstairs. Jack was really like consistency. The pair of you sit and after you tell Jack what happened with you downstairs, Jack apologizes that you had to go through it and then tells you a little about what he knows of this place.\n\nJack goes on about how he bought this Gray Building years ago for cheap and figured it would also be good to store all his stuff along with being a place he could live and thus no longer living in his mom’s basement.\n\nHe then mentions he went to check out the place after he bought it and right away he experienced weirdness. He said the first time he opened up the door to the place there was a jungle village inside. He mentions that upon entering the building seemed to whisk him away to this place and his surroundings completely changed.\n\n“Curiosity got the better of me I guess. However it wasn’t just a jungle. I found out later when cannibals were chasing me, that I was on an island made of Styrofoam and held together by hemp rope. Barely escaped.” Jack says.\n“What?! That’s…incredibly random.” You say.\n“That was just the beginning. Of course any right thinking person, would have just written this place off, but I couldn’t help but find it fascinating. Of course I found it less fascinating the second time I went in, when I was attacked by these shadow wolf things. Barely survived that too.”\n“Why the hell did you keep coming back here?”\n“Well I actually stayed away after the second time. Though after a few months, I felt drawn to the place again. I can’t explain it, but as it turned out third time was the charm, well maybe not entirely, but the place started to become more accommodating. In time, I started to encounter less dangerous shit and the place became more normal, well as normal as it could ever be I suppose. Still, I was never quite willing to go all in and actually live in this place until recently and that’s only because of some positive weirdness that I experienced when in this building a few months ago.”\n“What happened?”\n“Well I saw a glimpse of the future and in few days I believe this world as we know it is going to start resembling Road Warrior. Of course even without seeing the future I was listening in on some pretty scary radio broadcasts before the Ground Zero corporation started cracking down and scrambling the airwaves.”\n“Wait, you say you saw the future, like how exactly? In your head or what?”\n“No, it was a portal or rather a small window that opened up on the third floor. Happened rather suddenly while I was up there deciding on where I should put more of my stuff a few weeks ago. I saw Security City get nuked. The town looks like it survived, but I saw that overrun by mad people, like rabid or something. Given how the people in town have been acting and the world situation lately, I’d say what I saw was on the mark. It was then, I decide that I might actually be safer in here.”\n“Doesn’t seem like it, by the look of things.” You say.\n“No, apparently I was wrong about that. (Sigh) I dunno, I’m sorry I got you involved in all this.”\n“Well it’s done now and it seems like I was fucked no matter what this week. So, is there anything we can do? I mean we can’t really stay here I think you’d agree, but if the world is doomed like you’re saying, where could we go?”\n“Know where there is a fallout shelter?” Jack asks.\n“Yes and no. My older brother made one a long time ago back home, unfortunately its entrance is a bit of a mystery now since he’s dead.”\n“That would mean going back to town anyway and with the National Guard and the rabid there I imagine it’s going to resemble a warzone.”\n“Well there has to be somewhere we can…is that snow?” you say noticing the hallway.\n\nAt this point Jack stands up and you do too, both with your weapons ready as you approach the hallway where white flakes are falling from the ceiling and snow is starting to fill up the hallway. Jack looks to the left and right and then speaks.\n\n“Well I don’t see anything else out of the ordinary except the snow, but I think we better get the hell out of here and take our chances with the outside world, whatever might happen to it.” Jack exclaims.\n“Don’t need to tell me twice.” You say and the pair of you run as quickly as you can back down to the first floor.\n\nWhen you get to the first floor, you and Jack make your turn towards the large front room and that’s when reality starts warping and you’re getting disoriented again.\n\n“Shit…” Jack says tripping over. You go to help Jack up and that’s when you see them again. Those tentacle things coming at you down the hallway, which is once again increasingly being enveloped in darkness. There’s no magical bald guy around this time to save you either.\n\n‘Oh fuck, we need to move!” You say and start running towards the front room. Jack follows along.\n\nWhen you get the front room the lights flicker. Junk is still scattered all over the place and there is also no front door now, but TWO open doors.\n\n“What the fuck?” Jack exclaims and then the lighting gets even dimmer and soon you’ll be left completely in the dark save for the illumination coming from the open doors.\n\nAt glance, one door is leading to what looks to be a tropical area since you’re seeing vines, trees and such. The other door is leading to a snowy area and you can even feel the cold air whipping in from that one.\n\nAnd those creatures are still in pursuit behind you with darkness ever encroaching. You’re starting to hear them now in your head, howling, chattering, gibbering. It’s madness and you need to leave now.\n\n“Shit, my head…” Jack says staggering.\n“Come on! This way!” you say and start heading towards the jungle.\n“Wait! That’s a fucking jungle, and I know nothing ever good comes from entering one! Remember my first trip here?” Jack says.\n“Well, it’s either that or the fucking artic and we’re not exactly dressed for that!” you say.\n“I’d rather take my chances with snow than a jungle.”\n\n“It’s pointlessss….death…isssss everywhere…embrace madnessss and ssssave yourself… embrace usssssss…” a voice in your head suddenly interjects this is followed by hideous mocking laughter.\n\nMaybe you’re getting resilient or something because you manage to keep it together. Jack isn’t looking as great though which is odd since you figured he’d be used to something like this. He’s having a hard time standing up and you’re having a hard time keeping him from falling.\n\nEither way, you’re making the decision on which way to go.\n",
  "page 281": "You like Jack and all, but obviously you need to break this habit of going for guys that save you and have really complicated baggage.\n\nYou head towards the door, open it revealing that it’s almost night already and get out of the building. Your car is still parked in the same location and you waste no time in starting it up and driving away.\n\nYou almost don’t want to look back at the building, but you’re compelled to do so anyway. However when you do, you see absolutely nothing in your rear view mirror.\n\n“What the fuck?” you say and then briefly turn your head to look directly and it’s confirmed, the Gray Building is gone. You didn’t see it disappear, but it obviously has. Where, you have no idea, but you feel a little bad for leaving Jack now. You can only imagine what might have happened to him.\n\n“He already knew what that building was, Suzy. He’ll be fine and if he isn’t…well YOU had to get out of there right? In fact HE’S an asshole for not telling you what the hell that damn building was about in the first place…yeah…goddamn it…” you say to yourself.\n\nIn your haste to forget about some of the stuff you saw, you absent-mindedly turn the radio on.\n\n“Fuck, it’s going to just be ads for Ground…what the hell?” you say as you hear something you didn’t expect.\n\n“…and talks today were very successful between the President and several other world leaders. It would seem that despite previous disagreements, tensions in the world are lower than they have been in quite some time. In other news, financial experts say things are looking up for the economy ever since…”\n\nYou change the station and find actual music on; in fact you do this several times and find no annoying Ground Zero ads at all! Just the normal annoying ones in between the music, but the fact that anything else is on is very surprising to you. No doom and gloom as far the news goes too or at least not as bad as it was when you remember.\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nYou also remember that Jack told you he heard on the radio that your town is under marshal law; maybe that’s no longer the case too? You certainly hope so, because you have no idea where else to go.\n\nAs you drive you wonder about the Gray Building and what it might have done. You start forming weird theories, but given what you just went through, maybe they aren’t so weird.\n\nYou first wonder if maybe you went through time somehow. Maybe the passage of time goes slower in there or something. You do remember that frightening bit when you aged and then reverted back briefly. (You look in your mirror again to make sure you are indeed still young and of course you are) Maybe all the troubles in the world subsided and things are back to normal? If so, you can’t imagine that it’s just been a couple days and everything would be okay again. You would have had to been gone a long time.\n\nIt also occurs to you that maybe you went back in time and maybe this is before the whole world started going to shit (as well as your town).\n\nThe immediate hole in either of these theories is the fact that the music playing on the radio stations is current. Of course you could just be listening to the “oldies” station and perhaps a shitload more time has passed than you thought.\n\nWouldn’t support the going back in time theory though if that’s the case and unless every station is an “oldies” station you quickly start dismissing the idea that you might’ve travelled through time.\n\nYou dismiss it altogether when you hear a newsperson on the radio announce today’s date.\n\nSo you haven’t travelled through time…maybe you went to a different dimension? You certainly don’t think those things or that bald guy were from your world. Then there was that flickering effect that you experience where you were in a halfway normal location that looked to be an auditorium.\n\nIf this is a different dimension though, so far a lot of shit is the same. Same famous musicians on the radio at least. Same world leaders mentioned, same celebrities mentioned that you know of.\n\nOf course things seem to be a lot better as far as the world not nearly being on the verge of blowing itself up. You suppose you won’t really know until you get back to town.\n\nThe drive is a long one, and it’s nightfall by the time you reach your town. You aren’t seeing any military trucks or any blockades, so that’s a good sign. As you drive into town, you notice that it isn’t an anarchic mess that it was when you left. It doesn’t even look like there was any riots or disasters at all. Just normal traffic and there isn’t even much of that going on right now.\n\nIt is at this time you know this can’t be your reality and while you’re certain glad you aren’t in immediate danger anymore, you can’t help but feel a bit lost.\n\nWhat are you going to do? Do you still go home? What is home going to be like now? Will you still have the same crappy life? How much is different?\n\nOnce again, about the only thing you can do is find out, hell it isn’t like you have much better to do now.\n\nYou drive home which is a lot easier to do when there aren’t assholes throwing bricks at your windshield or general chaos in the streets.\n\nWhen you arrive at what you presume is still home you park on the street and you notice it’s slightly different. The house doesn’t look like it’s in a state of disrepair mainly. It doesn’t look like the lights are on either, which isn’t excessively unusual since Kelly is usually working at this time, Peter’s in the garage and you’re in the basement so there isn’t exactly anyone in the front living room or even upstairs where you might see a light.\n\nPeter’s car isn’t in the driveway either, maybe he’s out or maybe he doesn’t live here, you can’t know. You aren’t even sure if this is your house. Who knows, maybe you don’t even live in this town.\n\nSurprisingly even after all the mess you’ve gone through, you still have your house key so after taking it out of your pocket, you get out of the car an head towards the house.\n\nYou walk up to the front door and you’re about to try your key, but then you wonder if maybe you shouldn’t just ring the bell or knock first.\n",
  "page 284": "Even if your key fits, that’s no guarantee you live here. You could very well be trespassing and if someone is actually in this house right now, you could find yourself in deep shit when the owner finds you and pulls a shotgun on you.\n\nErring on the side of caution, you ring the bell a couple times and knock.\n\nYou wait a few minutes thinking that nobody is home which might mean it’s at least safer to try your key, but then you think you hear footsteps and a voice. Soon you see a light emanating from the front room. Someone has come to answer the door at least.\n\nAn older man opens the door and you can hardly believe your eyes.\n\n“It’s damn near midnight who the hell…Suzy?!” your father says mid rant.\n“Dad?” you answer back, not really expecting to see him.\n“What are you doing here? I thought you weren’t visiting until Saturday.” Your dad asks.\n\nYou have no answer except a sudden raising of your arms and a smile.\n\n“Um, well surprise!” you utter and go to hug your father, who returns the hug.\n\nIt’s weird, you never really had a close relationship with your father, but somehow seeing him alive AND not being a pathetic drunk that just watches TV pining over your mother makes you a little happier to see him. You wonder what changed?\n\n“Well, okay Suzy. We’re always glad to see you, you know that. Just wish you would’ve called in advance you know?” your father says and invites you in. You notice that the furniture lay out in the living room is different along with the furniture itself. A lot of little things are different really.\n\nThe “we” sort of throws you at first since you wonder if your dad is referring to your siblings. However you soon see who he’s referring to and if you couldn’t believe your eyes when seeing your father still alive, you really don’t believe them now.\n\n“George, who is…Suzy? I thought you were visiting Satur…”\n\nYou immediately run to hug your mother before she can even complete her sentence. She’s older looking of course, but you’d recognize her anywhere. You can’t believe you’d ever see her alive again. You’re having a hard time holding back tears of joy.\n\nMeanwhile your parents are both a little perplexed by your behavior.\n\n“I love you mom.” You say squeezing her tightly.\n“Well of course you do. I know that. I love you too, but why are you here at this late hour? You could have called us first, you know how we like to turn in early.”\n“I know, I know, I just…I just wanted to see you guys, you know?” you say finally letting go of your mother, yet still staying close to her.\n\n“I know it’s a long drive from Security City, have you slept at all?” you dad asks.\n“A little. Don’t worry, I’m fine. So how are you guys?” you ask.\n“We’re good, though there has been a neighborhood burglar skulking about. If he tries coming in here, he’s getting both barrels. It is really late though, and while your mother and I would love to talk, can we do this tomorrow morning? I have to get up to fix this overhead light in the living room which decided to go out today.”\n“Oh…yeah sure. Don’t let me keep you up.” You say.\n“You can sleep in your old room. It’s pretty much the same as when you left it, still haven’t turned it into a storage room or anything in case you were wondering.” Your mom says.\n“Oh good, I want to check on some old things I left here anyway.” You say and start to head towards where the basement is only to have your mother call out.\n“Um, Suzy where are you going?” your mom asks.\n“I’m going to my room.”\n“Don’t you think you should be heading upstairs then and not towards the basement?”\n\nYou nearly face palm for not realizing that maybe you had a different sleeping arrangement in this reality. You play it off with a laugh though.\n\n“Oh! Yeah! Hah! I’m sorry, I’ve had a very long drive and I’m a little loopy and tired I suppose.” You say.\n“You okay Suzy?” your father asks.\n“Yeah, yeah, I really am. Like I said, I’m just really tired. I’ll probably fall asleep soon after I get to my room.”\n“Mmm, I told you about driving when that tired before. You could get into an accident.” Your dad says.\n“Oh George, don’t lecture the girl now. Let’s just be glad we have a daughter who is still thoughtful enough to visit us.” Your mother says with a smile and pats you on the shoulder. You return the smile.\n\nYou are really glad to see her again.\n\n“(Yawn) Alright, well if we’re done here, I’m heading back up, you coming Bertha?” your dad asks.\n“Yes, Suzy you heading up too? You said you were tired and wanted to go to your room.” Your mom asks.\n“Yeah I will soon, but I also haven’t eaten all day, you don’t mind if I grab something out of the fridge right?”\n“You know better than to ask. Help yourself.” Your mom says.\n“Don’t make a mess though. Oh and remember, your room is the second door on your right.” Your dad snorts in jest due to your previous confusion. It’s actually a good thing he told you though since you probably would’ve been fumbling into random rooms when you actually went up there.\n\nYou dad kisses you on the head before saying goodnight and heading up the stairs. Your mom does as well causing you to hug her once again. You almost don’t want to let go, but you know you need to keep it together.\n\n“I’m really glad to be back home, I missed you.” You say.\n“Suzy, we just spoke a few days ago.” You mom says.\n“I know, but it’s just not the same as seeing you in person, you know?”\n“I know sweetheart, we’ll have all day to talk tomorrow. Goodnight.”\n\nYou watch as your mom heads upstairs and you’re soon left alone where you continue to hold it together until you go downstairs into the basement where you finally release your tears.\n\nYou honestly didn’t realize just how much you missed your mother until you saw her again. You certainly were very sad when she died in your reality and for some time after, but overtime you didn’t just move on, part of you just shut down completely. Maybe that explains some of you problems.\n\nAfter composing yourself, you actually take a look around the basement and find that it’s much different than your own. For one, “your room” is just a storage space full of old clothes, tools and other junk. You almost get a little nervous looking at all the junk as you’re reminded of the Gray Building. You quickly leave the basement, not wishing to dwell on that which led you here in the first place.\n\nYou spend some more time just looking about the house, particularly the pictures which right there is already a major difference since there are barely any in your own house.\n\nYou see several happy family photos, which you attempt to use as a quick way to possibly learn what you can about your “family.”\n\nIt looks like your dad wasn’t a travelling lightning rod salesman and worked at the meat processing plant in town since you see a few pictures of him in a factory uniform. Him being around probably helped. Your mom seems like she was still a housewife from what you can tell.\n\nYour brother Ben apparently went into the actual military rather than just being a paranoid survivalist nut. You see a lot of his pictures are of him in uniform. Looks like he got a lot of ribbons and honors too. You also see a picture of him with your best friend Julie in a wedding dress… they got married! You can imagine Julie from your reality would have liked that considering she always had a crush on him. (Or maybe she just wanted to fuck him, you don’t know exactly or care to think about it) Looks like they had two children, which you can’t even wrap your head around.\n\nYou don’t see as many pictures of your sister Kelly, but they do exist. A lot of her pictures show her in uniform too, but one of a police officer. Seems like your family is really “orderly” in this reality. She looks about the same, just with less scars. She still looks mean and serious business in every photo though, so maybe some things never change. No pictures of a boyfriend (or girlfriend) or children.\n\nOne thing you don’t see pictures of are of Donna or Peter. Surely with as many pictures there are displayed, you’d see some. You can only guess your parents stopped having children after you. Which makes you the “baby” you guess. Might explain why your family is a bit more stable too considering there were less kids to give your parents grief.\n\nFinally, you see pictures of yourself. Quite a few of them in fact. (More than Kelly definitely) You look more or less the same as you did at the various ages you see yourself. You also look pretty happy in every photo and you see that you graduated from college in this reality too. You don’t see yourself in any uniform, so you wonder what you do for a living.\n\nIt’s at this moment you realize that you can no longer ignore that this reality, this family and these memories are not your own. It’s depressing and you also realize that it’s been mentioned that the Suzy of this reality is supposed to be coming for a visit on Saturday.\n\nYou can’t stay here even though you’d like to, you’re going to have to leave before things get weird. You’re also going to have to figure out what you’re going to do with yourself in the long term. In some ways, the fact that the world isn’t going to complete shit, puts the pressure on even more. After all, if the world had ended it wouldn’t have mattered if you figured it out or not.\n\nStill, you’ve got one more day. One more day at least to spend here and enjoy before you figure out what you’re going to do with your life. You deserve that at least right?\n\nAnd so after grabbing a quick snack, you retire to your “old room.” It’s much brighter than your own old one in the basement, but then that because it’s a proper bedroom and not a dank dark basement.\n\nYou look around a bit, but you figure you can better investigate your room tomorrow. Right now you’re too exhausted from today’s events and drained from the emotions of seeing your mother alive and finding out you had a much better life in an alternate reality and how it’s just another example of how life isn’t fair to you even across the fucking multiverse.\n",
  "page 162": "Sisterhood\n\n\nThe future…\n\n“Hey, those trailer park rednecks had been fucking assholes to us for years. It was high time that we burned that whole heap of trash to the ground like it deserved. It’s just too bad we couldn’t do it when we were temporarily stuck in that hell hole.” You exclaim.\n“Yeah, I know I just sort of wish there had been another way to deal with them. Wiping out entire communities isn’t really something that is particularly popular you know. I mean there were children and other innocents there too.” Donna says.\n“Well that’s why we can blame that shit on the Cult of Tiamat. They’re the crazies that took things too far, or whatever…I dunno, you know how to spin this shit, you’re the politician not me.”\n“Oh yes, the alliance with the cultists. That’s going to be an easy spin…(Sigh) I can’t believe you convinced me THAT was a good idea.”\n“Hey look, if we had gone head to head with those trailer park assholes by ourselves, it would’ve been a bloodbath for us. Considering the cult was also their enemy, it was a good opportunity to re-establish an old contact as it were. Besides, Bobby’s bitch of a sister Diana wasn’t around anymore so I knew I’d have more clout. Not to mention we’ve got a peace agreement with them now so that’s TWO less enemies in our immediate area now.”\n\nDonna gets up from her desk and pours herself a drink. She downs the whole glass in one gulp and pours another shot.\n\nIt’s funny; she used to drink for enjoyment at one time. Nowadays she drinks to keep herself from being overwhelmed with all the shit she has to deal with. That party girl is long gone and when she took over New Security from Henry she disappeared completely.\n\nPopularity was always her specialty, but you’ve always been the stronger one. Without you Donna probably would’ve failed at this community leader thing a long time ago.\n\nOf course without Donna, you probably would’ve gotten lynched by an angry mob a long time ago. That “good girl” that once hid out in the basement is long gone too. While you didn’t become the “outlaw savage” that you worried about becoming, you still lost that “civility” and over the years as you had to deal with shitty things in this shitty new world, well it was just easier to be the cold bitch that would kill someone without hesitation.\n\nAnd that’s why you’re a team.\n\n“So Suzy. You and Bobby rekindle something?” Donna asks putting down her glass.\n“Hah, no. Bobby’s one true love nowadays is his blessed Tiamat. Followed by his sister Helen. Still, it doesn’t hurt that I was an ex that I imagine he still has the occasional fond memory.”\n“You think he’ll leave us be?”\n“Sure. I mean we’ll always keep an eye on his group, but now that those rednecks are gone, more territory has opened up for Bobby. He’ll be satisfied in the foreseeable future.”\n“Okay…(Sigh) ugh, I don’t feel like going out there and giving a fucking speech right now…”\n“Look, I know you’re stressing about this, but I promise you the people of this town aren’t really going to be that upset by the destruction of a bunch of hostile trailer trash. Some of them will probably throw a party. This isn’t the old world anymore where you got the U.N. or some shit waggling their finger at you for war crimes. People are back to the mindset that their tight knit communities come first and fuck everyone else. Besides even if you do have some idealistic fools screaming about injustice or some shit, you’ve still got the support of our militia of which I am currently head of. I’d say you’re not in any danger.”\n\nDonna smiles and shakes her head.\n\n“Jesus Suzy. I’m sure glad you’re on my side.” Donna says.\n“Hey, sisterhood forever right?” you say extending your hand.\n\nDonna nods and grips your hand followed by a hug.\n\n“Sisterhood forever Suzy.”\n\nAnd with those words, Donna straightens her clothing and heads out of her office to address the public and you follow close behind.\n\nA few winks, a few smiles and a few lies later and Donna has the public in the palm of her hand just like you knew she would. She just needed your support for that extra boost of confidence.\n\nNot bad for a party girl and a basement dweller.\n",
  "page 283": "You might as well try your key, if it doesn’t fit then you can ring the bell.\n\nYou try your key. It works! Maybe you live here after all.\n\nIt’s pitch dark inside and you fumble around for a light switch on the wall, but apparently it doesn’t work which already seems like something that would happen in your own house. Unable to achieve illumination that way, you see the silhouette of a lamp in the darkness and you head to it. Unfortunately you end up tripping over a bunch of shit in the dark, because apparently the furniture is arranged differently in this house.\n\nYou end up breaking the lamp in the process of trying to turn it on. You curse and just sit in the dark for a moment holding on to your bruised shin and knee. You then attempt to carefully get up since the last thing you want is broken shards of the lamp in your hand or anywhere else in your body.\n\nJust as you’re about to carefully make your way to the kitchen and turn the light on there, you hear a creaking noise. Sounds like it’s coming from upstairs.\n\nYou go in that direction just in time to see a figure at the top of the stairs followed by the muzzle blast of a double-barreled shotgun. The impact throws you against the wall and you wheeze for breath and cough up blood.\n\n“Got that fucking burglar!” you hear a vaguely familiar voice shout as you bleed out.\n“George?! Is it safe?” another voice calls out. Sounds female and you can’t believe you’re hearing it after all these years…either of the voices actually. But especially hers…\n\nSuddenly the upstairs light comes on which provides just enough illumination to shine down on you and the voice of who you now know belongs to your father becomes very panicked.\n\n“OH SHIT! OH FUCK! BERTHA! BERTHA! CALL 911!” your father shouts and runs down the stairs nearly tripping the process.\n\nHe drops the shotgun and goes over to you, but you’re already well on your way to death.\n\n“Suzy! Oh my fucking god! I didn’t mean to…what are you even doing here?! I thought you were visiting Saturday! I didn’t even know you still had a key to the house! Oh shit! No! Hang on!”\n\nWhile your dad attempts to hold you, your mother who apparently is also very much alive in this reality still doesn’t quite know what’s going on until she sees the carnage.\n\n“SUZY! NO! GEORGE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?” your mom screams and runs down the stairs.\n“I didn’t know! I didn’t know!” your father exclaims.\n\nYou can’t talk or do anything except gurgle and choke on blood right now, but as the light begins to fade from your eyes and the life starts leaving your body, you watch your mother approach and tearfully embrace your bloody body.\n\nAnd somehow seeing your mother one last time before you die doesn’t make it quite so bad.\n\nYou just wish it had been under better conditions.\n",
  "page 165": "No need to make this more dangerous than it needs to be.\n\n“Alright I guess we’re going to the carnival.” You say.\n“Good. be ready at the trailer park entrance in a few minutes. Someone there can probably hand you a weapon as well.”\n\nWhen you arrive at your destination, a group of rednecks are already there checking various rifles and handguns. It really does look like they got enough to take on an army. Their attention turns to you.\n\n“Well now if it isn’t blondie. I’m surprised Mel is riskin’ his piece on the side like this.” One of the sleazier rednecks says.\n“I know that’s right Ray. If she was mine, I’d be wantin’ to keep her safe.” Another says.\n“Piece on the side? Is that what Mel told all of you?” you ask which is followed by a lot of snickering.\n\n“Not in so many words honey, but we ain’t the idiots that he thinks we are. Why else would he tell us to lay off of ya if he wasn’t stickin’ ya? Sonofabitch already has Tina, don’t see why he gets ta have TWO fine pieces of ass while some of us ain’t got none.” Ray remarks.\n“Could I have one of those rifles please?” you ask ignoring Ray’s comments.\n\nRay snorts at your request.\n\n“Don’t think so blondie. Maybe you think yer warrior princess or some shit cause you got lucky shootin’ a couple of those freaks, but I ain’t impressed and you ain’t getting any of these rifles. Here, take one of these instead. Should be more than enough for you seein’ as all yer gonna be doin’ is hidin behind Mel the whole time anyway.” Ray says and hands you a smaller pistol.\n“Fine, I don’t need a big weapon anyway. I don’t have to over compensate for something.” You say taking the pistol.\n“What the hell’s that supposed to mean?” Ray asks.\n“It means she’s sayin’ you probably got a small pecker Ray, now quit givin’ the girl a hard time and let’s all get goin’.” Mel sudden remarks as he walks up with a couple more people.\n\nRay doesn’t say anything and just glares at you before leaving for one of the trucks. Everyone else does likewise. Predictably, you have no wish to ride with any of them, let alone in the back of one of the pickups with a bunch of them so you ride up front with Mel especially since you want to address something.\n\nAs the trucks pull out from the trailer park, Mel fiddles with the radio, but he doesn’t get anything except Ground Zero ads.\n\n“Goddamn Ground Zero shit. I’m tellin’ you like I’ve said to everyone else, it’s a fuckin’ conspiracy goin’ on with them. In fact all of this shit goin’ on is government related.” Mel says turning off the radio.\n“Yeah, probably. Hey Mel, is it really necessary for you to lie and tell everyone that we’re having sex?” you ask.\n\nMel starts chuckling a little bit.\n\n“Who said I did that?” Mel asked.\n“Well first of all a few days ago Tina flat out asked me if I had any intention of fucking you, and I had to clarify that I wasn’t. She believed me, but she said you told her that I flirted with you. Then Ray just said that I was your piece on the side. Everyone else seems to believe that as well.” You say.\n“Okay, first off I’ll admit that I might’ve said you were flirtin’ with me to Tina, but there was a good reason. We’re just makin’ up from one of our many bad fights and I figured it might be good to get her a little jealous. Y’know so she doesn’t take me for granted and that she could possibly lose me if she isn’t careful. Knowin’ Tina she probably thought it was bullshit anyway, which is probably why she just flat out asked you as opposed to just clawing yer eyes out if she thought it was remotely true.”\n“Well she did say that she didn’t believe it.”\n“Exactly. She knew a girl like you wouldn’t be interested in someone like me. Still, it was a good gesture on my part to show her I still care.”\n\nAt this point you’re not going to decipher hillbilly love life logic. You just continue to listen to Mel explain himself.\n\n“Now as for Ray an’ the rest. All I told them is to lay off of you a little bit since you were new to the trailer park an’ you were doin’ your best to contribute. I really can’t help it if everyone jumps to conclusions.”\n“But you’re not exactly dispelling those conclusions either.”\n\nMel laughs again.\n\n“Well, I suppose yer right about that, but think of it this way, if they all think you’re my squeeze on the side, they’re actually all less likely to try anything because they won’t want to answer to me. I mean right now all they do is stare a lot and make the occasional cat call. Now I could tell them that we’re really not doing anything, but after interactin’ with Ray, do you really want him or some of the others sniffin’ around on a regular basis?”\n“Ugh, I suppose not…just wish there was another way.”\n“Man’s world, blondie, deal with it.”\n“Trust me, I am. I just don’t like it.”\n\nYou and Mel continue to drive in relative silence until you get to the carnival destination.\n\n“This should be coming up to it soon.”\n“Didn’t even know there was a carnival nearby.”\n“Yeah, set up shop I think last Saturday. Most of us from the trailer park went there earlier in the week. I didn’t go mainly because I was too busy fightin’ with Tina at the time and I didn’t wanna run into any clowns. Hate those creepy fuckers.” Me;\n“Really? I always liked clowns. I even briefly thought about wanting to be one when I was little. Oh well, guess that will always be the dream.” You say causing Mel to give you a look like you just creeped him out a little.\n\nYou drive up to the carnival, which looks like it was in the middle of being packed down, but other events got in the way and given the ones you suffered, you can sort of imagine what those were. The place looks like a warzone and there are several bodies lying on the ground\n\n“Looks like I was right, the Guard was here.” Mel says pointing to a military truck near a dilapidated tent.\n“Don’t think they’re still in charge here either.” You say.\nIn the distance you see a few small figures near a large tent and then they run into it when they see you pull up.\n“Well looks like whoever is still in charge here is going to be meetin’ us real soon.” Mel says and stops the truck. The other trucks following stop as well.\n\nYou see several people now step out of the big tent. Some of them are armed, but then again so is your side.\n\n“Get ready, but stay in the truck. I’m gonna actually try to handle this without a gunfight, but I’m not hopeful about that.” Mel remarks and gets out of the truck.\n\nYou see him motioning and shouting to the rest to hold fire and then he addresses the carnie crowd who seem to mostly consist of midgets and the main one addressing Mel is dressed in clown clothing, though he doesn’t seem to be wearing the makeup.\n\n“It’s okay, it’s okay. Ain’t nobody lookin’ for a fight.” Mel says.\n“Doesn’t look that way, given that you’ve come with three trucks full of armed men.” The midget clown says.\n“Heh, well I’m sure given your own heightened state of awareness, you know things are getting’ dangerous nowadays. Anyway my name’s Mel, I’m guessin’ since you’re the one talkin’ you’re in charge here. Ringmaster or something like that?”\n“Look, we don’t want any trouble.”\n“And you won’t get any trouble. You…uh…got some military gear here too I see. That truck over there.”\n“Yeah, what of it?”\n“Oh nothing, but that brings about the question of where are the guardsmen…heh yeah they tried to tell us what to do too. Didn’t work out so well. The second amendment says you got the right to pack it after all. Government can’t just do what they want.”\n\nAt this point more people come out of the tent, which in turn makes more people get out of their trucks. You get out too, though you’re taking cover behind the door. Your people and the carnies are both starting to eye each other waiting for someone to fire a shot.\n\n“Look let me cut to the chase shorty. I’m assumin’ you might know by now what’s been happenin’ back in town. Besides the government tryin’ to pull their shit, there’s a bunch of freaks runnin’ around tryin’ to eat people. A bunch of them attacked us last night and while we fought them off, some of us got badly hurt and are in need of medical supplies. Now of course we did try goin’ into town first, but was just too fucked up there an’ we didn’t make much head way what with the freaks AND the guard all over the damn place. Then it occurred to me today that your circus might still be around and the National Guard probably would’ve been here as well so we decided to investigate. Now the group of weekend warriors at the trailer park had shit for medical supplies. So I’m hoping your detachment had more in that department.”\n“We ain’t got anything! Just go away or we’ll open fire!” the midget clown says.\n\nMel isn’t convinced and in any case he has no intention of backing down now.\n\n“Now you might get a few of us, but I’m bettin, most of us are better shots than y’all, so if you give us what medicine supplies you do have we’ll leave here in peace, if not well…”\n\nWhile Mel is probably doing the best he can in trying to resolve this without a gun battle, but you know how this is going to go down. It’s just been that sort of week.\n\nSuddenly someone fires a shot and then another from one side and then it’s a full-blown shoot out. (You mainly hide behind the truck, firing every once in a while)\n\nThe carnies aren’t holding back, but your side does indeed have much better aim and midgets are falling like flies until they all fall back into the big tent again.\n\nAfter some more shooting which is completely one sided now, Mel calls a halt to it.\n\n“We can fire all day into that big tent, but we can’t be sure if we’re actually hitting anyone since we ain’t got x-ray vision an’ I don’t want us wastin’ anymore ammo. We gotta do something else.” Mel says.\n“Why don’t we just throw grenades at it? We got some from the Guard that was fuckin’ with us.” Ray asks.\n“Because they might have medical supplies in there ya idiot. We start blowin shit up, an it defeats the whole purpose of the trip. I think we need to spread out an creep up then just rush in.” Mel says.\n“So your solution is to go in there like a SWAT team an’ possibly get our asses shot off? Fuck that. I’m blowin’ that motherfucker up.”\n\nAt this point Ray and a couple others look and nod at each other and start heading towards the big tent with grenades in their hand. Mel tells them to stop, but his orders are ignored and met with a couple of swear laden sentences of being tired of him always telling them what to do.\n\nMel is visibly angry; though you’re surprised he isn’t doing more to stop them from disobeying his orders. As much as Mel isn’t exactly your favorite person, you’d hate to see this as the first sign of a “change in leadership.” Especially if it’s going to be Ray.\n",
  "page 286": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou wake up with the sun shining in on your bedroom. You can safely say you haven’t had that experience in a long time, if ever.\n\nYou aren’t sure what time it is, but knowing you, you probably slept through the morning as usual.\n\nOnce again, you’re stuck in the same clothes you’ve been wearing since the beginning of the week. While you can certainly shower, you’d really rather change clothes at this point so you go through your room and hope that your alternate self left some old clothes in it.\n\nAfter going through some drawers you find that your alternate self has about the same fashion sense as you do, meaning pretty simplistic. The clothing itself tends to be a bit brighter though as everything else seems to be in this reality and it’s starting to get on your nerves.\n\nYou grab a pair of old jeans and a shirt and head to the bathroom where you wash up and later attempt to brush your teeth using your index finger with toothpaste on it. The jeans and shirt are a slightly tight on you though. It’s not enough that your alternate self has a happier life, but the fucking bitch is apparently a size smaller than you as well.\n\n“Oh well, I guess I’ll just be that much more popular with horny guys (Sigh) …unfucking believable…” you mutter as you squeeze yourself into the clothes.\n\nAfter getting dressed, you head downstairs. The first thing you see is dad on a small ladder working on the overhead light he mentioned wasn’t working. You don’t think you’ve ever seen your own dad ever fix anything.\n\n“Hey, look who’s finally up. You sleep well? You must have considering it’s the afternoon.” Dad says.\n“Yeah, I guess I really needed the sleep. Where’s mom?” you ask.\n“She’s in the kitchen. Oh meant to ask you, where’s that silver sports car your drive? I didn’t see it in the driveway or even on the street.”\n\nSilver sports car? Seriously? You own a fucking sports car?\n\n“Oh, um…yeah I decided not to drive that one here, it’s been giving me trouble lately anyway. I got an older car for cheap to just drive around in; it’s that small blue one outside.” You say.\n“Oh. Okay. I just thought I’d ask. Like I said, there’s been some burglaries and I was concerned that the criminals had expanded to car theft too. Probably a good idea you didn’t bring it, nobody is likely to steal that thing outside.”\n“Yeah, I suppose so.” You say and head to the kitchen.\n\n“Fucking sports car…” you whisper shaking your head before you greet mom in a friendly manner.\n\n“Hey sleeping beauty is finally awake! You sleep well I trust in your old bed?” mom asks while she works on cooking something.\n“Yeah. Slept fine. What are you cooking.”\n“Oh I’m preparing big batch of beef stew. I swear your father would probably not eat anything else. It will take awhile, but I can make you something before then of course.”\n“Nah, I’m okay.” You say sitting down.\n\nYour mother smiles at you and you smile back, but you don’t say anything else.\n\nIt’s weird, you wanted to talk with her so much yesterday, but now as reality sets in that she’s not really your mother, you’re sort of at a loss for words and awkwardly silent.\n\nStill, you want to make the most of this time so you struggle to think of a topic without being suspicious.\n\n“So…uh…how are Ben and Kelly doing?” you ask.\n“Well Ben is still stationed over in Europe. Not exactly sure what he’s doing over there, but it doesn’t seem to be dangerous for once, which I for one am glad about. Julie and the children I imagine are glad about it too. You talk to her recently?\n“Not for awhile.” You say which is sort of the truth.\n“Oh. Well I did hear you two weren’t on speaking terms any longer. I hope you make up though since the pair of you were always good friends and the both of you probably said words neither of you really meant.”\n“Wait, what?” you ask.\n\nYou mother stops chopping potatoes for a moment to address you directly.\n\n“A few months ago, Ben told me that Julie told him that you got in argument with her about how she’s too strict with your niece and nephew and she told you not to tell how to raise her kids. I can’t remember the entire exchange of what else happened except I know she ended up calling you a dyke that won’t ever know what it means to be a mother anyway and then you swore at her and hung up. While I can certainly see Julie’s defensiveness about how to raise her children, I don’t think it was right to say such hateful things, just because of your lifestyle choice.”\n“Lifestyle choice?” you say a bit confused as you’re attempting to process everything.\n“Oh right. I’m sorry Suzy. I know you were born that way. You explained it very well to your father and me when you came out years ago before graduating from college. We’re just still a little old fashioned in our way of thinking and it lapses at times.”\n\nYou do not believe this…\n\n“But I’m not a…” you start to say, but then realize why bother correcting her? It would just confuse things for when their real Suzy arrives.\n\n“…I’ll try to make the attempt with Julie, but she really needs to apologize.” You say instead.\n“You always were the bigger person. And I wouldn’t give it another thought as far as what she said about being a mother is concerned. There’s always adoption and I also know you people are really big on all that artificial insemination stuff. I’m sure when the time is right you and Heather will…”\n“Heather?”\n“Yeah, your girlfriend. Wait, you didn’t break up with her did you? She seemed so nice when you brought her here for us to meet her…”\n“No…no…I didn’t break up with her, um… so how is Kelly again?” you ask really wanting to change the subject.\n\n“Kelly? Well she’s Kelly. Still one of this town’s finest and doing a good job at it. Wish she’d find a better man to settle down with though. She seems to flip back and forth between these various loser guys that are so far beneath her it isn’t even funny. She really could do so much better and it’s not like there haven’t been several good men that have made genuine attempts to woo her. She doesn’t want to be tied down though and it’s her life I suppose.”\n\nWell now you’ve heard everything. You truly are in bizarro world.\n\n“You okay dear?” mom asks.\n“Yeah, yeah I’m just fine mom.” You answer\n“Well enough about your siblings, how are you doing? You working on a new book yet?”\n“New book?”\n“Yeah, you started writing a new book again? I know last time you said you had a bit of writer’s block. Honestly I don’t know how you come up with all the ideas you do. You’ve written like three books already. I know I don’t have the imagination to do that, but you always were creative even as a little girl.”\n\nSo that’s what you do. You’re a writer. Makes sense actually. In fact you almost want to kick yourself of why the hell you never tried your hand at it in your own reality. You certainly procrastinate enough.\n\n“I’ve got a few ideas in my head I suppose. Writing is never an exact science.”\n\nBefore you have to make up more shit on the fly, dad comes walking in.\n\n“Smells good in here already. Anyway I fixed the light and now I’m going to the hardware store, I’ll be back later.”\n“If you already fixed the light, why do you have to go to the hardware store?” you mother asks.\n“I have to replenish all the stuff I used.” He says, but mom doesn’t look convinced.\n“Okay I just want to go because I really want a new drill.” Dad breaks down and admits.\n“George you’re really silly sometimes when you try to make up stories.”\n“Well it’s where Suzy gets her story telling ability from!” dad remarks and pats you on the shoulder giving you a smile, which you return.\n\n“Okay, see you both later.” Dad remarks and leaves the kitchen with Mom still smiling about the silliness.\n\n“You and dad seem very happy.” You remark.\n“Of course we are. Why wouldn’t we be? We’re enjoying our elderly years together, we’ve had a successful marriage, we have three successful children that love us, grandchildren, a nice home, what more could one hope for?”\n\nWhat more indeed. You’re still thinking about what the hell you’re going to do with your own life.\n\nDespite a few major differences in your alternate self, you’d still switch places with her. She’s got everything, a formal higher education, successful career, a fancy car, a significant other and most importantly a loving family.\n\nYou begin to get lost in your own head, which is then disrupted by mom.\n\n“Suzy? Suzy?” mom asks.\n“Huh? Yeah?” you answer.\n“Are you really okay? You’ve been sort of spacing out lately.”\n“Oh, yeah. Well like I said, I’ve got a few story ideas in my head and sometimes I get lost in thought.”\n“Okay. Well I really have to go to the bathroom, can you finish cutting those carrots?”\n“Oh yeah, sure mom.” You reply.\n\nYour mom leaves the kitchen leaving you alone with your thoughts and cutting up carrots. You increasingly become melancholy as you dwell on how things still suck for you and as you’re apt to do, you begin talking to yourself.\n\n“(Sigh) Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, only you could find the negative out of the one relatively positive thing about thing about this fucked up week. Pull yourself together girl. You survived a hell of a lot worse than this. You wanted to be self-sufficient, we this is a good start. A fresh new world is your oyster and you’ve got plenty of opportunity…”\n\nSuddenly you hear a phone ring. It’s the land phone on the kitchen wall. You walk over and nearly grab it immediately, but then you remember you’re not really supposed to be here.\n\nHowever, you then notice the caller I.D.\n\nSuzy.\n\nYou are compelled to pick up.\n\n“Hello?” you answer.\n“Hey. Mom? Is that you?” the voice on the other end says.\n\nYou pause. You never realized that you and your mother sounded so similar before.\n\n“Yes, of course it’s me honey. Who else would it be?” you say.\n“I dunno, you sound a little different. Might be that ratty old land phone you have though, I keep telling you to get a cell!”\n“Oh you know me dear, your father and I are a bit set in our ways.”\n“Don’t I know it. Ha ha! Nah, I know you guys really do try. So hey, I was just calling to let you know I’m coming a little bit earlier and I’ll probably be there sometime late tonight. Like probably after midnight.”\n“You are?”\n“Yes, like I said I just wanted to let you know so you guys don’t get too mad when I’m knocking on your door late at night waking you up…unless you want me to stay at the town’s motel until tomorrow morning. I know you guys go to bed early.”\n\nIt is at this moment that the dark idea your mind has been dancing around for quite some time isn’t going away and is now in full bloom.\n\nIf you just got rid of this Suzy, all your problems would be solved. You just have to muster the fortitude to do it…\n",
  "page 164": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“HEY BLONDIE! GET YER ASS UP!” you hear as someone pounds on the door waking you up.\n\nIt sounds like Mel, but at least it isn’t those awful Ground Zero commercials.\n\nYou groggily get up and through bleary eyes you see that it’s actually still morning. You haven’t been up this early in a long time…and it’s a horrible thing.\n\nYou hear more banging and yelling causing you to respond in kind.\n\n“Alright! Alright! Goddamnit, I’m up! I’m up!” you say and go to the door.\n\n“What?!” you ask though Mel doesn’t look too happy that you’re even asking that question.\n“What? Whadda ya mean what? Yer fuckin’ sister and that cowardly motherfucker Jimmy Ray just skedaddled outta here with a perfectly good truck that was also actin as a temporary barrier! That’s what!”\n\nThis remark isn’t quite comprehended by you in your current groggy state.\n\n“My sister fucked Jimmy Ray in his truck and what?” you say.\n“Jesus fuckin’…I said…bah, I’m not fuckin’ repeatin’ myself! Shit!” Mel shouts and walks away banging on the door one more time. You briefly step outside and see Tina standing nearby.\n\n“I’m guessin’ you didn’t know nothin’ about it anyway considering you’re still here.” Tina remarks.\n“Okay, someone tell me again what happened? What about my sister and Jimmy Ray now?”\n“Apparently your sister convinced Jimmy Ray to leave this place in the middle of the night. Guess she really laid it down good, but then Jimmy Ray’s always had a tendency to get stupid over a gal who knows how to work it.”\n“Wait. Wait. Wait a minute she’s gone?!”\n“Yeah, she’s fuckin’ gone with a perfectly good truck! I actually don’t even give a shit about Jimmy Ray, he was more useless than tits on bull, but we could’ve used that fuckin’ truck for…” Mel says.\n“Oh for fuck’s sake Mel, we got a shitload of trucks here and aren’t you converting those army trucks into some sort of road warrior deathmobile anyway?”\n“Yeah, but it’s the fuckin’ principle of the thing! Not to mention we still gotta find some medical supplies! Goddamnit, Dan was supposed to be keepin’ a look out and…”\n\nYou leave Mel to rant and head back inside trying to process this new information. You can’t believe that Donna would just leave you like that. There was no indication she was going to just take off like that.\n\nYou check her bedroom and see that her bag is gone. You don’t know if she took that just after you fell asleep, or if she came back for it before leaving or what. Was she planning it right from the start or did she just see the opportunity? None of it matters you suppose, she just ditched you and didn’t even have the courtesy to let you know.\n\nSo much for “sisterhood.”\n\nWhile you’re thinking about this, someone enters the trailer and calls out to you. It’s Tina.\n\n“Oh there you are. I’m guessing you’re pretty upset right now, but I found this in Jimmy’s trailer. Figured you should have it.” Tina says and hands you a note.\n\nDear Suzy,\n\nSorry, I just couldn’t stick around. Good luck to you in this shithole.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDonna\n\nYou actually chuckle a bit and crumple up the note.\n\n“What’s so funny.” Tina asks.\n“Oh just thinking that she was the one that convinced me to come here in the first place. Anyway, it’s done and she’s gone. We were never really close to begin with, though I thought that was sort of changing this week, but I guess not. Still, at least it felt like someone was on my side. I imagine I’m not too well accepted around here.”\n“Meh, I think you’re about as accepted as anyone else around here. I mean I think the general assessment of you is that you’re a big tease that thinks she’s better than everyone else, but I mean its not like you’re a nigger or something.” Tina remarks.\n\nYou give Tina a strange look.\n\n“Um, lucky me then I guess. Just out of curiosity what do you think about Donna leaving? She kept going on about how you two were friends.” You say.\n“Me? Eh, I don’t really care. I mean I knew your sister on and off for a few years when I use to do strip jobs over at the parties at the place she was livin’ at before. An while she was a funny girl that made that particular job a lot more enjoyable, so I didn’t mind helping her out with a job when she asked, but it wasn’t like I ever considered her a real friend. Hell, I didn’t even know she had a sister until a few days ago. Anyway, always knew she was flakey. To be honest I didn’t even see her lasting long as a stripper and living here either. She probably would’ve latched on to first sugar daddy she could find and ditched everything.”\n\n“Sounds about right.” You say and toss aside the note.\n\n“Well I’ll leave you alone blondie. And I wouldn’t worry about your status here or lack there of. Quite frankly so many folks here have died or are wounded that nobody’s really in any position to antagonize someone who actually has been making an effort to contribute around here. Speakin’ of which I need to go talk to this crazy man that’s probably still ranting about a fuckin’ truck.” Tina says and leaves.\n\nYou take a shower as you’re thinking about how you’re going to proceed next. You go back and forth on whether to do what your sister did, but knowing your luck, you’d end up getting caught so you ultimately abandon the idea.\n\nAs you’re getting dressed and figuring out what your next plan of action should be, you suddenly hear banging on the door of your trailer again. You go to the door and see it’s that methhead Dan.\n\n“Hey blondie! You’re needed for a vote!” Dan exclaims.\n“Vote? Vote for what?” you ask.\n“We need a tie breaker to shoot the ones that got bitten or not. Billy Ray in particular ain’t lookin’ too good.” Dan remarks.\n“So what are we doin’ if we don’t shoot ‘em?”\n“Guess we’re goin’ back to town to try for medical supplies again. If that’s the case, I hope we have better luck, cause it was a cluster fuck last time.” Dan says.\n\nAs you walk with Dan, he’s looking at you a lot and while some of that is predictable ogling, he’s also doing a lot of twitching and it’s making you nervous.\n\n“Dan, I know you have to take a glance at me every now and then, but between the staring and the twitching it’s making me uncomfortable. Makes me think of those things that attacked us yesterday. It doesn’t help that you’re about as clean as they were too.” You say.\n“Oh. Sorry blondie. I just…I need a fuckin’ fix. Just to put me at ease. The shit that’s been going down for the past couple of days has really made me scared y’know? I went through most of my shit after the National Guard showed up and then I used the rest up immediately after the freak invasion.”\n“So where’s the meth lab? Don’t places like this usually have one?” you ask.\n“Hah, I wish. I mean we used to have one years ago, but it blew up and caused a lot of damage. After that, the old owner sort of cracked down on that sort of thing.”\n“Well there’s no law anymore, you could just start making it again.”\n“Hah, yeah. But again with everythin’ that’s gone on, isn’t like there’s been time to do that. Not to mention Mel’s been ridin’ everyone non-stop. He’s already pissed at me for fallin’ asleep yesterday. I didn’t catch Jimmy Ray an’ yer sister taking off in the night. Guess he figured if anyone would stay awake all night it would be me, but I just sort of crashed because like I said I didn’t have my shit anymore to keep me alert.”\n“Yeah, well it’s tough all over.” You say unsympathetically.\n\nBefore you even get to the meeting, you can hear the arguing, which is mainly consisting of a lot of shouting and swearing. By the time you arrive, you’re met with mixed glances.\n\n“These are our friends, we can’t just fuckin’ kill them!”\n“We need to fuckin’ kill ‘em before they infect us all!”\n“You’re one cold hearted sonofbitch you know that? What if I just decided to kill you?!”\n“Try it bitch!”\n\n“SHUT THE FUCK UP ALL OF YOU!” Mel shouts.\n\nAt this point all eyes are on you.\n\n“As you can see blondie, we’re involved in the democratic process and are in need of a tie breaker.” Mel says to you.\n“Aw Mel what the fuck we need her vote for? She ain’t one of us and her sister fucking stole a truck!” some redneck woman says.\n“I said shut it! The only reason why I even entertained this process is so you fuckers would quit bitchin’ about me bein’ a so-called tyrant even though I’m the only one around he trying to do anything at all! So however blondie votes, will break the goddamn tie and we can move on. So what’s your vote?”\n\nNot that you’re especially close to any of these people, but if you vote to shoot you know it’s going to cause a lot more problems and you being an “outsider” are going to catch all the hell for it. Besides, last you remember Mel was trying to keep these folks alive, best you vote on his side.\n\n“Well I vote not to shoot because…” you start to say before Mel interrupts again.\n\n“That’s all I need to know. Didn’t need the reasons. Hear that folks? We ain’t shootin’ any of them! I dunno why you pussies are scared anyway, we got ‘em all locked up and barricaded inside a trailer. They ain’t getting out even if they do turn into something.”\n\nAt this point there is more grumbling, but democracy has won this day and nobody gets violent about it, though you have a question.\n\n“Um, has anyone actually looked in on these bitten folks since they got thrown in together?” you ask.\n“Yeah, I did. Like I said, Billy Ray ain’t lookin’ too good. Neither are some of the others. They’re all mostly just lying there not doing much though.” Dan says.\n“Well was any first aid actually applied to them? I mean maybe they’re not infected, but just really wounded. Any aid might help.”\n“I threw in some bottles of whiskey an’ pain killers to ease the discomfort. I threw in some bandages in there, but I wasn’t gonna get close enough to actually bandage them.” Dan replies.\n“And that’s it? Nobody else has seen to them since they’ve been shoved in a trailer?”\n“Nope.”\n\nThis is nuts, these people that have been bitten could very well be DYING due to neglect more than anything else! Nevermind the fact that the reason some might not be moving is that they might’ve very well ODed from the alcohol/pill combo.\n\nIn any event Mel breaks up your question period.\n\n“Alright what we’re gonna do is fetch us some more medical supplies an whatever else we might find. Thinkin’ we should hit up that carnival a few miles from here.” Mel remarks which sort of takes most by surprise. You especially since you weren’t even aware there was a carnival in the area.\n\n“If the National Guard stopped here, chances are good they stopped at that carnival too. Maybe that detachment had more supplies and I also figure it’s gotta be easier than tryin’ to go back into town again.” Mel reasons.\n\nMel’s suggestion is met with mixed results, but the people seem to be okay with it. Probably because a carnival does sound a lot less dangerous than going back into town, which they assumed would be the case.\n\n“Okay, we’re taking three trucks an’ y’all that came with me last time are comin’ with me this time as well an I’ll be pickin’ a few more so don’t nobody go too far. That means you blondie.”\n\n“Wouldn’t it be better if I stayed here and looked after things? I mean you don’t want to leave this place totally undefended.” You say.\n“Oh it never is. I’m sure you saw that everyone is fully capable of defendin’ themselves here when those freaks attacked. But I can’t just be takin’ mothers ya know? I mean it’s bad enough most of the snot nosed bastards round here that survived ain’t got fathers and that’s before all this shit went down. Can’t hardly deprive ‘em of mothers as well can I? Someone needs to keep ‘em out of my way and look after them.”\n“Well isn’t someone like Butchie Billie better suited for something like this than me?”\n“Butchie Billie is probably our best welder and mechanic. I’m not gonna risk taking her. Besides, she still needs to work on converting our newly acquired army trucks. And some of the other guys I’m not takin’ are better at workin’ on the generators or digging some extra outhouses.”\n“I don’t have a weapon or least not any with ammo. I ran out of bullets during the last attack.” You say.\n“Oh don’t worry about that, if there is one thing we’ve got a lot of, its weapons and ammo.”\n\nAs you struggle to think up another excuse. Mel stops you.\n\n“Look blondie, you knew you were gonna have to start paying yer dues. And since I KNOW you were tryin’ to avoid bein the new fuck toy around here, it’s either this or you can just fuckin’ leave.”\n\nYou don’t see yourself making it on your own…at least not yet. You still need to be in the safety of numbers, so that means you’re going.\n\nHowever you question if Mel’s plan is even a good one. You could very well get to this carnival and not find anything, you sort of wonder if it wouldn’t be a better idea to actually head back to town. You figure the town is probably already half looted and lawless by now, so you might well go in and get the best stuff you can before its completely gone. Not to mention you might know the town a little better as far as which side streets to take to get to certain locations quicker. Like say small pharmacies and other stores near where you live.\n\nOf course putting yourself in more danger isn’t necessarily desirable either.\n",
  "page 188": "You’re not going to play her game. Getting into a fight is just going to make things worse. She’s all talk anyway, she’s just going to bark and not actually do anything.\n\nYou just stay silent and try to walk away. Diana however keeps barking.\n\n“Hey, where you going, this isn’t over you fucking bitch!” Diana says, but you ignore her and keep walking away.\n\nWhen you don’t respond, Diana moves from barking to biting which involves grabbing you on the shoulder and spinning you around.\n\n“Hey, get your hands off of me!” you say and attempt to push her away. Diana’s spoiling for a fight however and grabs your arm with her free hand.\n\nAnd unfortunately she’s also spoiling for your death.\n\n“You’re fucking too weak for Bobby, better that I take care of this now. He’ll thank me in the long run!” She exclaims and stabs you chest with her knife. You scream in pain and fall back in shock. Diana wastes no time in taking advantage and leaps on you while stabbing the entire time.\n\nWhile the noise brings the attention of other family members who attempt to pull Diana off of you, but it’s already too late, she’s hit several vital organs and opened up several of your veins.\n\n“All hail fucking Tiamat and her glorious chaos!” Diana yells in triumph and laughing as your blood is splattered all over her.\n",
  "page 190": "You get up and decide you need to take things into your own hands. You are not going to spend one more night under this roof with someone who openly wants to kill you.\n\nYou catch up to William who hasn’t gone far and ask him where Diana’s room is.\n\n“Left wing second floor…uh…you planning to do that thing?” he asks.\n“Guess you’ll find out soon.” You say and walk past him.\n\nYou make your way through the house and climb a flight of stairs. As you’re looking around for where Diana’s room is, you hear some voices and start heading towards them since they sound familiar.\n\nThe closer you get and you recognize one of the voices as Helen. The louder voice with the abusive tone can only be Diana.\n\n“Diana, please try to calm yourself…” Helen says.\n“Calm myself? Are you a fucking idiot?! That fucking bitch is an outsider and you’re seriously okay with that?! You’re okay with her taking Bobby away?” Diana replies.\n“But she isn’t taking him away, he’ll still be here…”\n“Helen, you’re a f…WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM? GET THE FUCK OUT!” Diana says when she sees you enter.\n\nHelen turns her head and sees you and she looks scared about what’s going to happen next.\n\n“Uh…um hey Suzy…I really don’t think this is a good time…” Helen remarks and tries to get in between you and Diana who is already making steps towards you.\n\nYou didn’t necessarily plan on Helen being here, but given how she’s been living in fear of Diana for years, you’re fairly certain you can angle that in your favor. You plan is fairly simple. You’re going to “apologize” but you know Diana is going to just start a fight again and in the process you’re going to do damage she’s going to be less likely to walk away from.\n\nYou’ve already clashed with her once, she wasn’t nearly as tough as she makes out and you’re tougher than you actually thought you were.\n\nSurvival of the fittest is going to play out very soon.\n\n“Diana, like I said before I didn’t come here to fight. I’ve just come to apologize if I offended you downstairs. I should’ve realized this is your home and I had no right to insult you.”\n“And like I said before I’m not interested in anything you’ve got to say you fucking man stealing cunt! Now get the fuck out of here before Bobby comes home to a corpse bride!”\n\nHelen at this point is practically pushing you out the door, but you’re not moving.\n\n“Diana, are you seriously going to threaten my life again after I’m trying to make peace?” you ask.\n“Suzy, please get out of here…” Helen says.\n“BITCH I DON’T WANT PEACE WITH YOU! YOU STOLE MY BOBBY AWAY RAAAAAAGH!” Diana screams and charges at you. Somehow Helen manages to duck and squeeze out of the way before she’s tackled along with you.\n\nDiana is now fighting with a fury you didn’t see downstairs. While she was certainly filled with rage before, now it seems like she’s possessed. You catch two blows to the face before you manage to push her back and land a kick to her stomach.\n\nHelen helplessly stands nearby calling for you both to stop, but neither of you are listening. Nearby vases are smashed, knick-knacks are knock over and even small pieces of furniture are damaged.\n\nEventually Diana pushes you backwards and then runs back into her room. You waste no time in chasing after her only to find that she’s attempting to grab a large dagger from under her bed.\n\nShe slashes at you with it, but misses and you land a kick to her face. You then grab her and slam her into a desk causing her to drop her knife.\n\nYou go to pick it up, but Diana prevents you from doing so by crashing her bruised body into yours. The pair of you roll on the floor some more until you finally get the upper hand again and knock Diana into her window and partially through it.\n\nDiana groans in pain, but doesn’t move. The top part of her body dangles outside, and her lower back is no doubt impaled on some of the broken glass. It’ll be a simple matter of you just picking up her legs and pushing her out.\n\nOr at least it would if Helen wasn’t around.\n\n“Stop it! Stop it please! Don’t kill her! She’s my sister!” Helen shouts.\n“Helen, this bitch has been abusing you for YEARS. Don’t you think it’s time for her bullying to end? Come on Helen, you know your life would be better without her. Come on, just let everyone know this was purely in self defense. You know this is the right thing.” You say.\n\nHelen looks around a moment and bites her lip. She’s very unsure, but eventually she complies.\n\n“…okay…just do it.” she says and turns her head away.\n\nYou smile and go to pick up Diana’s legs. You knew Helen would side against her sister.\n\nAs you push Diana out the window, that’s when you realize Helen’s sided against you as well. You feel a sharp pain go straight into your back. The shock causes you to temporarily unable to catch your breath as you try to reach for whatever it is that just got plunged into you.\n\nYou turn around just in time to see Helen give you a hefty shove.\n\n“Sorry Suzy.” She says and you fall out the window.\n\nThe thing is, you may have possibly still survived the fall, but unfortunately landing on your back with a big knife in it, drives it completely through the front of your chest.\n\nAs you lay next to Diana’s corpse, gurgling blood and struggling to breathe you soon follow her in death.\n",
  "page 191": "As much you’d actually like to get Diana out of the picture, it probably would be best to just keep to yourself for the rest of the day. At least until Bobby gets back. In fact you think about calling him about this, but you decide it would be better to discuss something like this in person.\n\nYou head back to your room and lock the door. So much for being “social” today.\n\nYou spend most of your time doing what you used to do in your basement, which actually suits you just fine. Though in between your computer game downtime (Sadly no Internet here), you also do more thinking about your future here.\n\nIt isn’t just Diana, you’re going to have to do something about; it’s also this whole Tiamat religion. You wonder if you’re going to have to sacrifice people. You aren’t even sure if you have it in you to kill Diana in cold blood (Maybe in self defense though) how are you going to kill an innocent person?\n\nYou also are wondering about Bobby’s desire to have children and how that’s going to go. While you’ve never thought about being a mother, that’s actually one of your lesser concerns.\n\nBobby’s family has a “tradition” of interbreeding. As fucked up as your family was, there was never any of THAT going on and you’re not exactly comfortable with the idea of your offspring having sex with each other…and just HOW young is that encouraged anyway?\n\n“Goddamnit Suzy, you really got yourself into a mess.” You say to yourself.\n\nBut its done now and you’re just going to have to muddle through. You briefly ponder escape, but you’re fairly certain that wouldn’t be a good idea even if you did manage to get out of the compound.\n\nNo, your best plan for now is to speak to Bobby about all this. Surely you’ve got some influence over him.\n\nHours pass and eventually when night starts to fall there’s a knock on the door.\n\n“Hey, Suzy. It’s Bobby, why is the door locked?” you hear Bobby ask.\n“Because I already had a fight with your bitch of a sister once today and I was avoiding any more potential conflict. Hold on…” you say and go to open the door.\n\nYou open the door and Bobby goes to hug you, though you barely return the favor.\n\n“Suzy, shit, you should put something on that.” He remarks about your face bruising.\n“I’m fine, stop! Don’t touch it. (Sigh) Look we’ve got A LOT to discuss. First of which is why the hell did you leave without telling me?”\n“I actually didn’t plan on leaving at all, but I remembered a few things that I left back at the house that I thought we should have here so I figured I’d make a quick trip there which turned out to be a cluster fuck. Shit is getting worse in town. Anyway, I saw no reason to bother you since I figured you wouldn’t even bother leaving the room. I had it planned for Helen to come up to serve you food at appointed hours, of course she mentioned the fight when I finally got in and she wasn’t sure if she should bother you. Now I already heard some of it from the rest of the family and especially Diana, now why don’t you tell me what happened exactly?”\n\nYou recount the event to Bobby and then add your own displeasure about his sister in general.\n\n“I know, I know, I’ll straighten it out.” Bobby remarks.\n“You said that before and that bitch is still trying to kill me! You better do something about her permanently.” You say.\n“Whoa, hold on now. I know you’re upset, but let’s rein it in a bit. I mean it probably wasn’t the best idea on your part to provoke her.”\n\nYour jaw nearly drops.\n\n“Bobby, I KNOW you just didn’t take her fucking side. Because if you are…”\n“I’m NOT taking her fucking side! I’m just saying my sister is a lot of bark most of the time and she only reacts when someone really provokes her.”\n“Oh, so what? Am I just supposed to put up with Diana’s abuse in silence? Be a doormat like Helen? NO! I had enough of that shit from Kelly, I didn’t come here just to repeat that cycle again! You told me you were the fucking leader of your family, shouldn’t you just be able to snap your fingers and they have to fall in fucking line?”\n\nBobby just hangs his head and slumps down on a chair.\n\n“(Sigh) Alright, alright, you made your point and you’re right. You shouldn’t have to put up with that sort of treatment. I’ll handle Diana, but from now on don’t get into a fight with her if she’s being a bitch. Just ignore her.” Bobby says.\n“Yeah well I’m not sure if that’s going to be an option if she pushes me too much, which brings me to some other issues.”\n“Other issues? What the else fucking happened while I was gone?”\n“Nothing, but I’ve been doing some thinking. If I’m going to be popping out children, I refuse to have them involved in some kiddie porn ring. I’m not having it! I can look past a lot, but that’s where I’m drawing the fucking line.” You say with authority.\n\nNow Bobby’s jaw drops.\n\n“Kiddie porn? By Tiamat’s Twenty Tits, what the hell do you think goes on here Suzy?” Bobby says being genuinely offended.\n“Well I don’t fucking know! I mean I know you guys participate in human sacrifice and commit incest like its no big deal! I mean you and your sister had to start experimenting with each other at an early age and taught that it was perfectly fine to do so. What the hell am I supposed to think?” you say.\n“You could’ve just asked you know. You could’ve asked about Tiamat and all this other shit before jumping to your own conclusions. I’ve tried on many occasions to actually enlighten you on my religion but (Sigh) nevermind. We’ll get to THAT later, first let me allay your fears of any rampant pedophilia going on here of which there ISN’T. Or at least under my watch there won’t be.”\n“So you’re saying that it has happened in your family.”\n“Look, I’m not going to lie and say that maybe sometimes that shit HAS happened in the past with other family members, but I’m sure my family isn’t the only one that has had such elements in it. I mean what about your family? Like your old Uncle Ed?”\n“Hey my Uncle Ed wasn’t a kiddie fiddler, he was just a plain old serial killer.” You say.\n“Oh well, I guess he was a saint then, look my point is, I think you’ve got the wrong impression about all of us. All right, it’s true my family did tend to interbreed a bit more in the past and yeah by and large we don’t see it as some great taboo. However it wasn’t like it was a standard procedure to get the kids to start playing doctor at an early age. To be honest, I probably only grew close to Diana because my dad was a fucking tyrant who barely let any of us socialize with others our own age. Then after mom died…who WASN’T related to my dad by the way, Diana and me just grew even closer and…well I won’t go into anymore because I’m sure you don’t want to hear it. I’m just saying it wasn’t like my dad was telling us to fuck one another or else. If anything, my dad probably was a bigger prude than some Christian fundies. If he had known what was going on, he probably would’ve horse whipped the pair of us for distracting ourselves from Tiamat’s glory or some shit.”\n\nBobby holds up his hand before you can interrupt.\n\n“So, what I’m saying is that any children we have aren’t going to be forced to have sex with each other or anyone else. That’s not part of the plan nor will it ever be.”\n“Hmm, glad to hear it.” You say.\n“Okay, are there any other concerns we need to discuss?”\n“Well, I don’t see why we can’t get married sooner, like tomorrow for instance.”\n“Because this Friday is perfect. I’ve already got things planned out.”\n“Wait, I’m the bride, shouldn’t I be planning all this out? In fact why do I have practically no say in this?”\n“Because…look…argh, fine besides wanting the wedding moved up what else do you want?”\n“Well…I dunno. Okay, I guess I don’t have any ideas. That’s not the point though, it’s the principle that I want my voice to be heard.”\n“Well trust me, after today it’s been more than heard. Look, if you DO have any requests, let me know because we can accommodate you…except pushing up the date. It really needs to be on Friday. Why do you want it pushed up anyway?”\n“William told me I’m in danger with Diana until I’m actually married to you.”\n“And I’m telling you not to worry about Diana anymore. I’m going to take care of that. And I wouldn’t listen to my cousin anyway. He’s a bit of a shit stirrer. Now is there anything else?”\n“No, I guess that’s all the major things for now. So um, how was your day in town?”\n\nAt this point Bobby tells you about his trip back and forth to his house and while to an extent it was exciting, he was glad to get back home to you.\n\nBobby also goes on to tell you that a few more family members apparently arrived while he was gone and you were in self-isolation.\n\n“Great, more people to hate me.”\n“Don’t worry about it. Tomorrow, I’m definitely not going anywhere so I’ll be around to introduce you to everyone proper. You’re not going to get the Diana treatment by all of them. To be honest, what little the rest have seen of you, you’re ahead in the polls. Helen likes you of course. You managed to impress William and some of the kids thought you were, in their words a pretty blonde lady that was beating up their mean sister Diana or aunt Diana in some cases. Even my cousin Brandon said you seemed okay and he barely ever gives an opinion without his wife telling him what to think.”\n“Well I guess that’s something I suppose.”\n\nAt this point Bobby goes back to reassuring you that everything will be fine and the pair of you spend the remainder of the night together. Eventually as the hours grow late the pair of you go to sleep.\n\nStill, you can’t help but have your doubts and concerns even though Bobby alleviated a few of them. You still think you’re going to have to take matters into your own hands rather than rely solely on Bobby.\n",
  "page 194": "While Helen would probably appreciate your company, you don’t really feel like dealing with all the little kids that are going to be hanging around her so William it is.\n\nYou head over and sit in a chair near him.\n\n“What are you watching?” you ask.\n“Nothing really, mostly Ground Zero ads. These fuckers are really raking in the money preying upon people’s fears like this. Gotta say though, if I was the corporate type, I’d sure want a piece of that action.” William remarks.\n“You believe its all a scam?”\n“Heh, well as always the best lies have truth mixed in with them. A day of mass destruction is definitely coming. I believe that. The writing is on the wall, but I know damn well GZ isn’t the savior from that. Nothing is except yourself and how strong your will to live is. Yep, dark days are coming and it’s going to weed out the weak so only the strong survive.”\n“Like the Morningstars.”\n“Heh, well some of us I suppose. To be honest, I’m not sure about some of the people here. I mean I love ‘em because they’re family, but…(sigh) well take Brandon over there. The guy would be killed and eaten in a completely savage world with no laws. His wife too. I dare say even you might thrive better.”\n“Thanks…I think.” You answer.\n“You see, this place. This compound that Bobby has tried to bring all the family to…it’s just another form of restriction. The day is coming soon where unbridled chaos is going to become a reality and Bobby…Tiamat bless him is misguidedly still clinging to ways that should be abandoned. Now is not really the time to hide in a fortress like some 80s cult. Now is the time we should be out there embracing the chaos like Tiamat intended.”\n\nLooks like there is a bit of dissension in the family that doesn’t involve you. At least not directly.\n\n“I thought you supported Bobby.” You ask.\n“(sigh) Yeah…I thought I did. I mean I still do. I respect WHAT he’s trying to accomplish and his plan. And I’m obviously not going to overthrow his power or anything…but I just don’t think this is going to be for me. Y’know? I’ve always been a bit more of a drifter and after being here a few days, I’m starting to get really bored. That fight you had with Diana was about the most interesting thing that’s happened here and while I’d certainly like to see the outcome of that drama, I don’t think I’m going to stick around long enough to find out. I’m going to be heading out, along with Aaron.” William says.\n“Aaron? That guy sitting in the corner who looks like a ball of pent up energy?”\n“Yep. He’s even more anxious to leave more than I am. I think he only showed up to meet up with me since he doesn’t have a vehicle and it’s always good to have at least one person to watch your back.”\n“So…when are you leaving?”\n“As soon as possible, in fact I’ll probably talk to Bobby, before I do. He’s going to be disappointed, but I know he’ll understand…so how about you?”\n“How about me what?” you ask.\n“Well, are YOU comfortable here? I mean you haven’t been here long and you already got into a major fight with Diana and nobody here seems all that close to you. Polite perhaps, but you’re not exactly bonding here.” William says.\n“Well that might take time, besides, still better than my own family so far.” You answer.\n“Hm, well what about this wedding? From what I know, Bobby sort of sprung that proposal on you. You okay with that?”\n“I love Bobby.”\n“Yes, I know you love Bobby. I don’t doubt that, but that’s not necessarily a good reason to get married. Hell, love can sometimes be the WORST reason to get married. Also if I know Bobby, he’s probably already got it in head that you’ll be popping out a whole mess o’ babies.”\n“…yeah, I actually already addressed some of that yesterday.”\n“What about the wedding sacrifice??\n“Wedding sacrifice?”\n\nWilliam pauses for a moment.\n\n“You mean to tell me, he hasn’t told you about the wedding sacrifice?” William whispers to you.\n“No! He…he’s not going to mutilate me is he?” you ask in a hushed tone.\n“No! No, no, no nothing like that. I just can’t believe he hasn’t told you considering it’s pretty important and he’s pretty big on all this ritual crap to Tiamat.”\n“Well what is it?!”\n“Nothing, you just have to sacrifice someone on an altar in the name of Tiamat to prove your allegiance and dedication to the family.”\n“What?!”\n“That’s the rules. I mean personally I think just a simple prayer while bludgeoning something to death in an alley works just as well, but like I said, Bobby’s all into the rituals. Guess he takes after his dad that way, but then again so do I. It is said that most sons become like their fathers after all.”\n\nThose last words by William aren’t very endearing ones given what a fanatic Bobby’s father was. Still your main concern is this human sacrifice thing. You didn’t think that you’d have to do it, in fact you aren’t sure if you’re going to be able. While you’ve had murderous thoughts about Diana, that’s a little different. For one, you haven’t acted on them, and two that’s self-defense. You don’t know if you have it in you to murder some innocent person in cold blood, let alone to some cult goddess you don’t even believe in.\n\n“I take it, you aren’t really enthused about the possibility of killing someone. Well someone who isn’t immediately attacking you at any rate.” William says.\n“Um, well…I wasn’t expecting to.”\n“See, this is something Bobby REALLY should’ve told you before dragging you up here. (Sigh) You’re supposed to be the love of his life and he should KNOW if you’re completely in sync with him. I mean not everyone is cut out to be a member of one of Tiamat’s chosen and that’s fine, but again he really should’ve asked you first.”\n“So…wait, where are they getting this…um sacrifice?”\n“The sacrifice? Oh got a whole mess of them in the basement in the left wing of this place. We captured a bunch of folks and locked them in cages before starting to move the family in…and I’m guessing that’s another thing you didn’t know about.” William says noticing your surprise at this revelation too.\n\nYou’re just silent. Combined with the mess with Diana, the wedding and all this new info, you’re starting to seriously wonder if you’re strong enough to go through with all this now.\n\nAt this point William leans over to you and keeps a low tone.\n\n“Look, I can see that you’re probably not cut out for this life and as I said, that’s perfectly fine. But Bobby… well I don’t think he’d take it well if you backed out now or worse, backed out on the wedding day.”\n“I know.” You say with your voice starting to get a little quivery.\n“Shhh, okay. Look, it’s not too late to leave this place. I’d be willing to take you with me, and I’ll drop you off wherever you want. Of course we’d have to do it secretly.”\n“How?”\n“Well, my van is the dark blue one out front. Here’s the keys.” William says and hands you some keys, which surprises you.\n\n“Don’t worry, I trust you. Besides, that big gate has to be opened up first anyway. All you have to do is hide in the can, until me and Aaron leave which shouldn’t be long. Just make sure you keep the doors unlocked so we can get in.” William says.\n“Aren’t they going to notice I’m gone?”\n“Well, this is a big place, so if you went missing for a little while people would probably think you’re either just wandering the house or maybe back in your room before suspicion arose. I’d also be willing to make up a story if it came to that. In any case, if you’re going to do it, we need to do it now.”\n",
  "page 193": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world cucumber eating championship! Let\u0027s all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe away the ranch dressing on your lips, graciously stand up and bow for your adoring fans. The Minotaur on your right looks at you in disbelief and then turns away to puke in a trough.\n\nMeanwhile the little Asian satyr on your left just shakes his head wondering how the hell you could\u0027ve beaten him.\n\n\"I don\u0027t understand it...all my training. I glanced over at you during the contest...you...you were barely even chewing! How?\" He asks.\n\"Oh just natural talent at swallowing cucumbers I suppose.\" You reply humbly and wink at the audience, which continues to praise you.\n\nWhile you\u0027re blowing kisses at your fans, you suddenly get a feeling you’ve done something like this before. In fact you remember you HAVE participated in similar contests and you can’t help but think there’s some sort of connection with what you’ve been eating at these things.\n\nSuddenly a hand touches your shoulder and you spin around to see a woman with long raven colored hair and a low cut black gown. It’s Bobby’s grandmother. This time she’s a little older and she still doesn’t look too impressed with you.\n\n“Yeah that’s great you got a skill and its real obvious that’s one of the things Bobby loves about you because men in general tend to make their most important decisions with their dicks.” She says to you.\n“Excuse me?” you reply.\n“To be honest I’m not even too sure about him, but nobody appears to have the ambition to stand up to him or are otherwise too much in love with him. That’s Diana’s problem right there. Anyway, MAYBE there is more to you than meets the eye. You might just meet Misty yet.”\n“Okay who the hell is Misty?” you ask.\n“Sheesh, you really are slow on the uptake there blondie. Well maybe you’ll get it, maybe you won’t. I don’t give a shit either way. Off you go then.” Bobby’s grandmother at this point snaps her fingers and at this point the Minotaur grabs your upper body and the satyr grabs your legs while the audience cheers them on.\n\nYou attempt to struggle without success, then a giant hole in the ground between the stage and the audience opens up. A swirling black void appears at the bottom. Without another word, you are tossed in which is followed by your screaming, the audience’s cheering and Bobby’s grandmother laughing.\n\nYou fall and eventually the light from above grows dimmer until you are enveloped in complete darkness.\n\nThen you wake up suddenly with one of your hands tightly clutching to the side of the bed.\n\n“No! Huh? Shit! Oh. Good. Not falling. Fucking bitch.” You incoherently mumble, which is heard by Bobby who is in the room getting dressed.\n“You okay over there?” he asks.\n“Hrm? Oh. Nothing. Just another fucked up dream. What’s going on?” you ask rubbing your eyes.\n“Nothing much, just some more of my family showed up here in the middle of the night. I was just about to wake you up to finally have you come meet everyone properly. Now I know you probably don’t really want to but…”\n“Yeah, whatever let’s do it.” You interrupt and get out of bed.\n“Wow, I didn’t expect you to be so accommodating so quickly.”\n“Don’t have much of choice now do I? I mean I’m going to have to get along with all these people. Better I make my good impressions as soon as possible before Diana starts spreading lies about me.”\n“Suzy, I wouldn’t worry about…”\n“Have you spoken to her yet?” you interrupt again.\n“Well no.”\n“Well until you do and lay down the fucking law, I’m going to assume she’s already caused a shitload of damage.”\n\nBobby stops dressing for a moment.\n\n“Suzy, what’s wrong? I thought we were good with our talk yesterday.”\n“WE are good. Diana and me though? Never will be and something is going to have to be done about it.”\n“Suzy, I TOLD you I’d fucking talk to her alright?”\n“Yeah, we’ll see.” You say and close the bathroom door.\n\nAs you wash up, you wonder if you were unnecessarily bitchy with Bobby, but then you think no you weren’t. You have a legitimate gripe against a woman who is trying to kill you and he’s SUPPOSED to be doing something about it. Honestly at this point you wish he’d do more than talk, but you suppose that’s wishful thinking.\n\nThat dream really put you in a bad mood.\n\nEspecially since you’ve had it three times now and it always ends with you getting fucked up in some way. Not to mention Bobby’s grandmother has started appearing in them. You’ve never been one to believe in the supernatural, but the dream shit is really starting to get too weird for you to ignore as just your subconscious in play. You’re starting to wonder if Bobby’s grandmother is mocking you from beyond the grave and one thing you don’t need right now is yet another Morningstar woman on your case.\n\nOn top of all that, you still ache from yesterday’s fight, but the hot shower at least feels good.\n\nAfter leaving the bathroom you get dressed. Bobby is still in the bedroom waiting for you. He doesn’t say much, but that’s probably because he’s trying to avoid an argument just before the pair of you are supposed to be “formally” meeting his people.\n\n“Okay, I’m ready.” You say when you finish getting dressed, Bobby nods and the pair of you leave the room.\n\nBobby finally speaks to you again as you walk and talk, though you’re mostly just listening to him going on about the other family members you haven’t met yet and how to best handle them. To be honest, you’ve already made up your mind that you’re going to treat them how they treat you.\n\nEventually you get to the large living area where you see familiar faces along with unknown ones. William sits in a large comfy looking chair and nods at you, taking a drink. You see that Brandon guy with a slightly chubby woman, you’re guessing that’s his wife Veronica. They both greet you, but nothing more than that.\n\nYou also see three new people who are more of Bobby’s cousins. They all introduce themselves, but much like Brandon and Veronica, they don’t do much more than that. You don’t get the impression any of this is personal either. Aaron doesn’t seem like he wants to be here at all. Ronald and Denise look more interested in each other than anyone else at the moment.\n\nYou then see Helen again who looks like she has her hands full with several boys and girls. She still manages to wave hi to you though. The kids themselves look at you, but seem to be pre-occupied with bickering with each other.\n\n“How many of those are your siblings again?” you whisper to Bobby.\n“Oh just the three. The oldest boy there Jordan and the twins Aiden and Nadia. The other half are Brandon and his wife’s kids.” He answers.\n“Um, shouldn’t they be looking after them then?”\n“I’m sure they do all the time and are just taking advantage of the extra support system they have now. I mean they trust Helen to look after them and Helen said she was happy to do it. Besides, everyone is family here so it hardly matters who is looking after them directly.”\n\nWhile you haven’t known these people long, you know Helen’s personality well enough that she’d agree to anything since she seems to be the family doormat.\n\nYou don’t see Diana, but someone mentions she’s in the kitchen making food for everyone.\n\n“Okay, I’m going to go do this now, because I don’t want to do it later. I’m going to go speak with Diana and straighten everything out and make it clear there is to be no more dissension in the family today.”\n“Hm, while you’re at it make sure she’s not putting rat poison in my food.” You remark.\n\nBobby heads into the kitchen leaving you alone with the rest of his family. Having little else to do, you make the attempt to be social.\n\nBrandon and Veronica are more talkative than the rest. They ask you a few questions and you answer. They don’t seem to really care too much about you though. As far as they’re concerned it isn’t their place to disapprove of you even if you caused such a negative reaction in them, which apparently you don’t.\n\nYou almost get the impression they find you more boring than anything else, which unfortunately due to your basement dwelling past might very well be a fair assessment. But you’ll take apathy because it’s better than hatred.\n\nBobby’s other cousins are more of a mixed bag. Aaron barely speaks to you at all and he’s pretty snappish when he does. He seems like he’s a pent up ball of nerves since he’s tapping his foot and moving one of his hands the entire time. In fact the more of an effort that you try to speak to him, the more hostile he starts to look. The moment you get the feeling of his eyes burning a hole in you the more you decide to move on.\n\nBy the time you get to Ronald and Denise, they’re making out, so you don’t even bother.\n\nWhich leaves you with William and Helen, the latter of which has already left the room with all the little kids of this family presumably to be out of the way as usual. William on the other hand is still relaxing in a chair at the far end of the room and watching something on TV.\n\nWell at least you know those two are friendly with you.\n",
  "page 196": "You already got one sister to worry about; you aren’t about to worry about another one. If you’re going to have to kill someone on your wedding day anyway, you might as well get in the practice.\n\nYou aren’t exactly looking forward to doing it, but you don’t see much choice. The question is how to go about it without making it look suspicious.\n\nYou take a glance around the room and see a window. You’re only on the second floor though, if you pushed her out of it, it might not kill her immediately. You then think maybe you could choke her first then throw her out…\n\nYes, that’s what you’ll do. Choke her and throw her out the window. It’ll look like a suicide and if anyone asks, you’ll just tell them the truth, she was in love with Bobby and was having a hard time coming to terms with him marrying you so out the window she went.\n\nYou walk over to Helen and sit next to her on the bed.\n\n“Helen will you stop crying for one moment?” you ask which causes her to comply.\n\nYou take a deep breath and exhale.\n\n“Okay, You seem genuinely distraught about all this…so this is going to make this harder.” You say and then you punch Helen in the face as hard as you can.\n\nHelen yelps and falls back on the bed and you pounce on her immediately with your hands wrapped around her throat.\n\n“Suzy…no! No! You…(cough)…” Helen squeaks out and attempts to hit you, but you ignore the pain and focus all your strength on her throat.\n\n“Shhhhh….Helen, stop struggling, just let go.” you say wishing she wasn’t making this so hard.\n“Bobby…he…help…” she utters with tears in her eyes.\n\nThis pitiful plea that she utters almost causes you to stop choking her, but you’ve come too far now. You can’t stop. The only thing you can do is get it done and try not to feel too sick about it, because you almost feel like you’re going to throw up.\n\nHelen’s face turns a different shade and you continue to focus on your grim work at hand. Eventually her squeals and punches disappear altogether when you successfully crush her windpipe and deprive her of any more oxygen.\n\nAnd the deed is done. You’ve killed a person and you feel pretty terrible even though you know it had to be done.\n\nYou’re exhausted and emotionally drained as you sit there straddling Helen’s dead body. You choke back tears, though you no longer can contain the rising illness and you immediately sprint off of her and the bed and vomit into a small wastepaper can in her room. You don’t even think about the fact that you’re going to have to clean it or all the loud noise your retching is making.\n\nNot that it mattered since Diana was apparently listening in and spying on you both the whole time.\n\nWhen you lift your head up out of the trash can still recovering from your bout of sickness, you look up just in time to see Diana’s swing a bat upside your head. You collapse on the floor, tipping over the trash can causing it to spill your sick back on to you.\n\n“Guess you didn’t want any more competition huh? You had the right idea though and I do thank you for saving me the trouble. Now I can legitimately blame Helen’s death on you and I was merely coming to the aid of my poor late sister. I can see I was just being tested…Tiamat’s glorious chaos sure works in mysterious ways.” Diana says and then hits you in the head with another bat swing.\n\nAnd then another…and then another…and then another…\n",
  "page 195": "Well at least you know Helen is going to be friendly with you. She’s pleasant with everyone.\n\nYou head into the next room and see Helen sitting in a chair preoccupied with watching the six children also in the room. While they’re being loud, they’re at least playing games and not being too disruptive. Helen sees you and smiles.\n\n“Hey Helen.” You say sitting next to her on the couch.\n“Hey Suzy. As you can see I’m just doing my role in this family.” She says pointing to the children.\n“Do you really need to look after them? Seems like they’re old enough to play by themselves.” You ask.\n“It’s not them we’d worry about, it’s the rest of this compound! While it may not look like it now, these little ones are balls of chaotic energy. Morningstar children have always needed a little extra supervision if only so they don’t end up burning the entire places to the ground. However it is true they all seem to be a little more subdued today. Even Jordan is playing with his siblings rather than fighting with them.” Helen says.\n“Um, which one’s Jordan?” you ask already forgetting Bobby already told you.\n“Jordan’s the oldest boy. He’s over there playing with his siblings Aiden and Nadia. They’re twins as you can tell. Actually those three are also my younger brothers and sister, so I do have a bit of a duty to watch out for them. Jordan’s getting to the point where I think Bobby is going to have to start training him though. He’s just becoming a teenager and he really wants to be like his older brother, but sadly he isn’t the sharpest knife in the drawer. He’s a still a fine boy though, he even has a bit of a crush on me which is sort of cute.” Helen says with a minor giggle.\n“Erm…yeah…so what about the twins?” you ask changing that last mildly disturbing remark.\n“Oh those two are very intelligent. They even got a mental link to each other.”\n“What really?” you ask.\n“Really. They often just sit across from each other nodding and occasionally changing expressions at each other. It’s like they’re having a conversation with their minds or something. I dunno, but sometimes it feels like they’re making private jokes about all of us. Jordan in particular and while he’s not the brightest, he’s smart enough to know when he thinks he’s being made fun of. And that’s when I often have to step in and tell them not to mock their brother.”\n\nAt this point both twins look in your direction and Helen’s. They give a peculiar smile and then return to the game they’re playing with Jordan. It’s enough to make you feel a little uneasy.\n\n“Um, Helen, they can’t read our minds can they?” you ask.\n“Oh no…at least I don’t think so. I mean I never even thought of that before. Oh dear, now I’m going to wonder about that.” Helen says.\n“Sorry didn’t mean to add to your worries Helen…or my own for that matter.” You say.\n“Oh, I’m not really that worried. Even if they can, we’re all family anyway and they know I have no ill thoughts about them or anyone connected to it…and that’s going to include you too soon.” Helen says and smiles.\n\nHelen next mentions that ever since Veronica and Brandon arrived, their children have pretty much been put under her care. She then points out Ione and Hannah (Who are playing another game with each other) and Leon (Who is building something and seemingly content to play by himself).\n\n“Geez Helen, you look like you always got your hands full, are you really okay looking after all the children all the time?” you ask.\n“Oh…it’s not so bad. I mean like I said, we’re all family. What’s family for if not to help one another? Besides, I know nobody else really wants to do or otherwise has other major responsibilities.”\n“What responsibilities do Veronica and Brandon have? I haven’t seen them do anything since I got here. I mean they got three kids, and they’ve obviously been taking care of them before coming here. They shouldn’t just be passing them on to you just because it’s convenient. You deserve to have your own time to yourself.”\n“Really it’s okay Suzy. I like looking after all of them. Besides, I don’t think the children would want someone other than myself doing it anyway. When you and Bobby have children I fully expect you’ll want help on the supervision front won’t you?”\n“Well…probably. I was talking about this subject a little to Bobby last night and to be honest I’m still not exactly enamored with the notion of popping out a bunch of them. The idea of the pain involved isn’t exactly something I’m looking forward to.”\n“Well I don’t think any woman looks forward to that part. It’s the joy of bringing a new life into this world, raising them and loving them.”\n“I…guess…I dunno. Hell I’m still having trouble with the concept of marriage, let alone kids.”\n“Oh? Is it the ritual sacrifice to Tiamat that’s got you a little baffled? Don’t worry, you don’t need to memorize any prayers, Bobby will probably tell you what to say or he’ll make the appropriate chants himself.” Helen asks.\n“What? Wait. I know you guys sacrifice people, but is that going to go on at the wedding?”\n“Well of course. It’s tradition for the one to marry into this family to prove themselves to be worth of Tiamat by making a sacrifice.”\n“Wait, you mean I’M going to be the one doing it?”\n“Well yeah…you mean Bobby didn’t tell you? Oh dear. I didn’t mean to ruin the surprise.” Helen says.\n“Oh it’s a surprise alright.”\n“Well if you’re worried about messing up, we’ve got more than enough prisoners in the dungeon you could practice on tomorrow.”\n“Prisoners? Dungeon? Oh geez…” you say and rub your hand over your head.\n\nHelen pats you on the back a bit and tries to look understanding.\n\n“I take it, you’ve never killed anyone before?” Helen asks.\n“Of course I haven’t! Why would I?” you exclaim.\n“I just figured you having a serial killer uncle and all…plus Bobby said you helped him kill your uncle.”\n“I didn’t really have a hand in that directly. Are you saying YOU’VE killed someone before?”\n“Oh yes, but I’m not exactly fond of it, but we all have to do our part to serve Tiamat.”\n\nThe fact that Helen just told you so cheerfully and without any hesitation that she’s committed murder, makes her seem a lot less harmless in your eyes.\n\n“Wait, so how many? When?” you ask.\n“Oh not many. First time was about when I was Jordan’s age. However, since Bobby is the head of the house, he mostly does it. Just like our father did before him. Diana sometimes does it, but I try to avoid doing it unless I really have to…I know I shouldn’t feel anything for infidels, but sometimes I can’t help it. Then I try to remember that their souls are going to feed Tiamat so it’s all for a good cause.”\n\nThis is nuts…\n\nRight now you’re just wondering how deep of shit you’ve gotten yourself into.\n\n“I…dunno if I’m going to be able to do this Helen…” you say.\n“Oh don’t say that! You’ll be fine!” Helen says trying to be supportive.\n“I don’t think I will. The most fucked up thing is, I’m still more worried about having kids!”\n“You still concerned about that? That will come naturally, I don’t think you should worry.”\n“I dunno Helen. I’m obviously not like you. I thought we were more similar in many ways, mainly because we both had to put up with an asshole older sister, but it’s turning out we’re pretty different. I mean unlike me you’d obviously make a very good mother. You’re nice, attentive and everything.” You say.\n\nHelen’s eyes light up a bit when you say that and she grabs your hand.\n\n“Thank you. You have no idea how touched I am right now to hear those words.” She says and then leans in quick to give you a quick peck on the cheek.\n\nIt surprises the hell out of you and you recoil a bit. Helen’s expression turns from one of happiness to one of worry.\n\n“Oh no. I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I shouldn’t have done that! By Tiamat, what was I thinking. I’m so sorry Suzy!” she starts saying which causes a lot of the children to start watching the pair of you.\n\nHelen stands up and begins to panic still repeating to you about how sorry she is, you think she’s going to have an anxiety attack.\n\n“Helen. Helen. Calm yourself. It’s…well…it’s okay. I mean I know you were just trying to be friendly and didn’t mean anything else by it. You just caught me by surprise, no harm done…” you say.\n\n“No…I can’t…you’ll have to excuse me!” Helen suddenly says and runs off. You try to call her back, but she’s gone.\n\nYou wonder if you should tell someone or go after her. Then one of the kids speaks to you.\n\n“Hey what’s wrong with Aunt Helen?” Hannah asks.\n“She’s having a lover’s quarrel with her girlfriend.” Ione says smirking.\n“She is not! My sister isn’t a dyke! Besides this woman is Bobby’s girlfriend!” Jordan remarks indignantly.\n“You’re just saying that because YOU like Aunt Helen!” Leon says and then makes kissy noises, which causes Jordan to punch him in the arm.\n\nAt this point they look like they’re going to get even more unruly, but then one of the twins speaks up.\n\n“She loves Bobby you know.” Aiden says.\n“Yes, Aunt Helen loves Bobby very much.” Nadia adds.\n“You and Diana must…” Aiden continues.\n“…die.” Nadia ends.\n\nThe creepy tone they say it in causes utter silence, not to mention sends a bit of a shiver down your spine.\n\n“Um…are you telling me… Helen plans on killing me and Diana?” you utter.\n\nThe twins just look at each other and smile. They don’t say anything else and just calmly go back to their game.\n\nThey’ve also managed to successfully creep out their brother and cousins who start to leave the room.\n\nMeanwhile, if Helen IS planning to kill you, you need to find out now. As much as you’re hesitant to speak to them again, you have little choice but to ask the twins where their sister’s room is.\n\n“Uh…hey, where is Helen’s room?” you ask.\n“Left wing…” Aiden says.\n“Second floor…” Nadia adds.\n“Go right then…” Aiden continues.\n“Through the last door.” Nadia ends.\n\nGreat now they’re being creepy in rhyme. They didn’t even look at you the entire time.\n\nYou don’t even bother to thank them, you just follow their directions. Eventually when you think you’re getting close, you hear some faint crying. You slowly look in a room to your right and find Helen weeping softly to herself on her bed.\n\nShe notices you and she tries to wipe away her tears.\n\n“(sniffle) Oh. You didn’t need to come see to me. Really I’m fine. I just acted foolishly, I apologize again for kissing you Suzy.” Helen remarks.\n“Um, yeah I’m not really bothered by that…or rather I mean that was unexpected, but…look nevermind about that. I’m here about something else of a more serious nature and I’m hoping we can hammer this out because whether you realize it or not, a lot of shit just got sprung on me within the last few minutes.” You say.\n\n“Is this about the sacrifice?”\n“No, this is about something your creepy twin mind reading sibling just said to me. They said you love Bobby.”\n“Huh? Oh…well of course I love Bobby. I mean he’s my older brother of course I love him.” Helen says a bit nervously.\n“Yeah and in any other family that wouldn’t mean anything more than friendship at best, but love goes to a whole other level in this family. There’s also the fact they said you were going to kill me.”\n\nNow Helen goes from nervous to shocked.\n\n“WHAT?! They said that?!”\n“Well technically they said you were going to kill Diana too and they didn’t say it so much as they heavily implied it, but given that they’re creepy as fuck and you said they can read minds, as well as your own guilty behavior on the whole loving Bobby situation and well what the hell am I supposed to think? So is it all true?”\n\nHelen just give you a sad look and then begins to tear up again and put her hands to her face.\n\n“Oh fuck Helen! You were lying and just plotting to kill me the entire time?! Goddamn it, had I known I was going to have to deal with not one but TWO of Bobby’s murderous sisters, I would’ve just stayed at home. At least I would’ve only had one to deal with there!” you shout.\n\nHelen tries to compose herself to address you.\n\n“No, that’s not true. (sniffle) I wasn’t lying to you. I genuinely like you and after our most recent conversation I like you even more. I mean…I really like you…but it is true I love Bobby. I’ve always loved him…(sniffle) I mean I always thought Diana was wrong for him and they were only together because she happened to be the oldest sister. Did you know I had two other older sisters and Diana killed them both for fear of competition? Everyone thinks they were accidents, but I knew the truth. Never said anything of course, I was too afraid and I didn’t want to cause any problems.”\n“Bobby never mentioned he had two dead sisters before.”\n“It’s not really something we discuss. It was a pretty traumatic experience for everyone at the time. My dad was very upset especially since Mom had died of natural causes no long before. It was a lot of family to lose within such a short period of time.”\n“So how come she didn’t kill you or Nadia?”\n“ Nadia’s a twin and will most likely bond with Aiden. Plus she’s much younger so no threat either way. As for me, well I was still young enough at the time when she killed my other two sisters. I guess I was just so weak in her eyes that she thought I wasn’t any threat. Maybe she even knew that I loved Bobby and enjoyed flaunting it in my face. In any case things really changed when you came into the picture. I wasn’t sure what to think really. Then when I finally met you, I could see why Bobby liked you. You were so nice and I want you to know I always felt like we were very similar too. You know, under appreciated in our own families. I wish you’d been my sister instead of Diana.”\n“Yeah? Well if I’m so nice, why were you still plotting to kill me?” you ask.\n“I wasn’t! I…mean not really…I mean…(sniffle) I just had this… this… idea and I dunno… it was just my mind! I wouldn’t have acted upon it! Especially not after getting to know you more! I can see you’re very good for Bobby. I’m genuinely hap…hap…(sob).”\n\nAnd Helen starts crying again. At this point you’re starting to wonder if she did have any intention on killing you, if she’d end up apologizing for it the whole time.\n\nThe fact is though, you’re still not entirely sure if she was going to do it or not. Maybe the twins were partially fucking with you. (Helen did say they liked doing that with people) Maybe Helen just had wishful thinking on her mind. It isn’t like you haven’t had thoughts about killing your own sister Kelly on more than one occasion. Of course the difference is, Helen’s actually got some bodies under her belt to go through with such a deed.\n\nAny other right thinking person would probably be trying to leave this mad house right now, but quite frankly the more you think about it, you don’t have many options and despite this fucked up situation with his sisters, you still love Bobby.\n\nAll of which means you’re probably just as fucked up as the rest of them (more than you realized actually) which also means you fit in here much better than you think, you just have to figure out how to deal with everything. First of which is Helen who against all odds, you actually still feel sorry for.\n\nOf course the other option is to start getting your hands dirty now and do away with her. It’s not like anyone’s around and she probably wouldn’t put up much of a fight.\n",
  "page 197": "Maybe it’s stupid or weakness, but you can’t bring yourself to kill Helen based on heavy suspicion. You decide to talk this out with her instead.\n\n“Helen…Helen…will you stop crying for one minute?” you say which causes her to comply.\n\nYou take a deep breath and exhale.\n\n“Okay. You seem genuinely distraught about all this…so I’m going to go out on a limb and take you at your word that you had no solid intention on killing me and it was just a fleeting thought that we all have once in awhile. I mean I’ve had them too.”\n\nHelen looks a little happier when you say that.\n\n“Oh…I’m so glad you feel that way Suzy…(sniff)” Helen says.\n“I’m not finished! I AM going to be keeping an eye on you though and I think it’s going to take me awhile to fully trust you.” You say which causes her to nod rapidly.\n“I…I understand. Wha…what about Bobby?”\n“Well that is the question isn’t it? I guess I could threaten you. However, that’s really not going to help matters and the heart wants what the heart wants. Can’t really stop that…well other than killing that person, but I think neither one of us wants to go that route. Let me ask you this though, does he possibly know already how you feel?”\n“Oh no. I don’t believe so. He’s either been too into Diana or too into you, to pay any serious attention to me in that way. So no, I do not believe he knows.”\n“Do you want to tell him?” you ask.\n“Oh! No! No, I can’t! Especially not now! That will just mess things up for you! I don’t want to be in the way! Please Suzy, don’t tell Bobby about my real feelings either. I…I’ve come to deal with the reality that Bobby will never be mine. Just wasn’t meant to be. I can be… happy without him as long as I know you’ll be making him happy.” Helen says and then tries to smile, but it doesn’t last long.\n\nThat was incredibly hard for her to say. You know her heart is probably breaking in a million pieces on the inside. You almost want to console her, but then you have to remember she might have been plotting to kill you.\n\n“Okay then…so are we good?” you ask unsure of what else to address.\n“Yes, Suzy. We’re good…um can I just have a hug?” Helen asks.\n\nThis family just gets weirder and weirder…\n\n“A hug?” you ask.\n“Well, I know you don’t trust me, but you’re still willing to give me a chance. That alone is more kindness than my own sister Diana has ever shown me. I feel closer to you than I ever have with her. I mean I guess I understand if you don’t want to…” Helen says a little sadly.\n\nYou look at her sideways wondering if this is some sort of trick, but if you’re going to go with this building trust route AND if it’ll make Helen feel better, you can do a hug.\n\nYou go to Helen and sit beside her on her bed who gloms on to you immediately. As you reluctantly hug back, Helen exhales as if a big weight has been lifted.\n\n“You don’t know how much this means to me Suzy…” she says.\n“Um, yeah.” You reply.\n“You smell pretty and feel so soft and warm.” She then says squeezing you a little tighter.\n“Uh…okay…I think I should be getting back to Bobby now.” You remark and start to let go though it feels like Helen doesn’t really want to let go.\n“Okay. You go back to Bobby, I’m sure he’s wondering where you are. I’ll be fine. Thank you for being so understanding. I’ll never forget this.”\n\nHelen waves good-bye with a smile as you leave her room. What a strange girl.\n\nAs you make your way back towards the stairs, you realize that you didn’t address the possibility that Helen might have planned to kill Diana as well, not that you care since you’d rather she be completely out of way. Even if Helen did have that plan, it’s clear that if she’s telling the truth about having too much feelings about killing you, she’s unlikely to kill her sister due to whatever fucked up battered sibling syndrome she has.\n\nBesides, as far as you’re concerned Bobby’s supposed to take care of the Diana situation or he will if he expects you to sacrifice someone on a slab on the wedding day.\n\nWhen you get downstairs the some of the family members are all eating. You don’t see Bobby though.\n\n“Hey Veronica have you seen Bobby?” you ask.\n“Oh, I think he went to your room to look for you. Figured you’d be there. I think he’s pretty upset about what just happened with William and Aaron.”\n“What happened?\n“They just left the compound. Not exactly sure what William told Bobby, but he and Aaron are both gone. Brandon’s outside closing up the front gate.” Veronica says and shovels more food into her mouth.\n\nGreat, more drama. You make the long trek back to the bedroom…\n\nSure enough, you find Bobby looking slightly mopey on the bed. These Morningstars sure are a miserable lot today.\n\n“Hey Bobby.” You say.\n“Hey. Where have you been?” Bobby asks\n‘Bonding with your sister Helen. You know, the nice one.”\n“Oh. That’s good. Glad to hear something going well…” Bobby says with his voice sounding like he isn’t as happy about that as he should be.\n“Okay, I already heard about William and Aaron, but what are you really upset about?” you ask.\n“I don’t even know why I’m bothering trying to hold this family together! Most of them aren’t even here. Two of them just left. One of them hates me now, and the rest aren’t exactly sterling examples of Tiamat’s Chosen. In fact the ones that are here are probably here because it’s safe and filled with enough supplies to live comfortably.” Bobby exclaims.\n“Well, what’s wrong with that?”\n“Nothing I suppose, but supporting about bunch of freeloaders wasn’t really part of my plan to honor Tiamat.”\n“Well maybe you need to change your damn plan. I mean its still early, but if you really feel like someone isn’t pulling their weight around here, then you need to just kick their asses out, family or not. I mean you’re the boss around here and your word is supposed to be law.”\n\nBobby sits up a bit as you continue to speak.\n\n“Look, you know you’re a leader and you know the head of this family. So you can’t give into all this self-doubt. You NEEDED to lay down the law to your sister Diana and you did it. In fact, speaking of which, what exactly IS going to be done about her? Because whatever you said you know that’s just going to be a temporary fix. Now I think you KNOW what you’re going to have to do with her, but your past with her is preventing you from doing it.”\n\nBobby continues to listen intently.\n\n“Love isn’t one-sided Bobby, and if I’m going to have to ultimately submit to your beliefs and everything that goes with it including murdering innocent people…”\n“Wait…you know about the sacrifice on the wedding day?” Bobby asks.\n“Yeah and thanks a lot for keeping me in the dark about it. But it’s fine, I’ve gotten over it. I’ve had a lot of time to think about things and how this marriage is going to go if it’s going to work. I’m willing to go all in, but you’re going to have to do likewise and fix this problem with Diana permanently. How is up to you, but she is NOT going to be here.”\n\nBobby looks a little overwhelmed by your ultimatum. He’s never heard you speak like this before and really; you’re a little surprised you’re saying what you’re saying yourself. You’re rolling the dice and betting everything here. You think you’ve got the inner strength to go through with all this, you just hope that Bobby proves to be just as strong.\n\n“Suzy, you are the love of my life and what you’ve just told me just confirms that Tiamat’s chaos did favor me when I met you. You’re right. I know I have to do something more permanent with my sister Diana. I’ll come to a decision tomorrow though. I think I need the rest of the day to recover from all the shit I’ve already had to go through. It’s not even night yet!”\n“Well, okay. I understand. Well, should we go eat with the rest of the family?”\n“No. I’m not really feeling it right now. I’d rather just spend time with you.”\n“Sounds good to me.” You remark.\n\nYou and Bobby kiss each other, which then soon leads to something a lot more intense.\n\nA little later after your pleasant round of passion, Bobby says he should go tell one of his family members to take the night watch and have a long conversation with all of them.\n\n“Well good luck on that front.” You say as you briefly check your phone out of curiosity.\n“Did someone call?” Bobby asks.\n“No, just curious. I was wondering if any of my family tried to contact me given how with the craziness going on in town recently. Guess I’m not surprised nobody cared to call. Not mad about it though, just one more confirmation that this is my new family and home now.” You say.\n“Well other than you know who, it seems like you’ve gotten along with the rest of my family. Sounds like you’ve really gotten along with Helen. So what did you two talk about anyway?” Bobby asks.\n“Oh… you know…girl stuff.” You say with a slight smile, which cause Bobby to snicker a bit.\n\n“Alright, you two have your little secrets. Just as long as you’re getting along. Love you.” Bobby says opening the door.\n“Love you too.” You say as he leaves.\n\nYou enjoy the rest of your evening in solitude until you eventually fall asleep.\n",
  "page 299": "FRIDAY\n\n\nYou wake up feeling slightly colder than you did last night, though it’s probably because the fire has died down a little and Jack is no longer spooning you. A quick look around though shows that he’s still here. He notices that you’re up.\n\n“Well good morning sunshine.” He says sitting at a table with a candle burning.\n“What time is it?” you ask, not thinking.\n“Your guess is as good as mine, but I’d say it’s still morning, maybe the afternoon. In any case it’s daytime the last time I looked outside.”\n“Oh right. No modern luxuries. Is that one of those books we found yesterday?” you ask.\n“Oh yeah. I was trying to read or at least understand any of it.”\n“You a linguist?”\n“Eh, not really. I mean I have studied a few languages from time to time for my own reasons and in a couple cases thanks to the Gray Building weirdness I had to learn some new ones, but it isn’t like I had any formal training on the matter.”\n“You understand any of it?”\n“Not excessively so, but I only really started. I get the impression whoever lives here is a fur trader. Some of this book isn’t doesn’t really consist of words as it’s a list of numerical symbols and totals. Fortunately those are universal. It would also explain the large amounts of furs piled up and this…” Jack says picking up the pouch of coins. “…I would imagine is their life savings.”\n“So you still think we’re in a different world?”\n“I dunno. As I mentioned I’ve looked outside while you were asleep, and wandered the area a bit. Not too far, but I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary save for trees, snow and a few white rabbits bouncing around. I mean that ugly head on the wall is the only thing I’ve seen so far that’s out of the ordinary. I will say that the presence of books at least shows writing and probably literature exists. The coins imply some sort of economy system. So civilization here exists, but of course who knows what said civilization is like.”\n“You said you thought it was a medieval one.”\n“Yeah, and I’m still holding on to that belief, of course it’s possible that maybe we’re just in a less advanced area. For all we know there are people whizzing around in jetpacks elsewhere.” Jack says and then snaps his fingers. “Oh I did see an outhouse. It’s not excessively far; we just never saw it yesterday due to the direction we came from. Well that and paying more attention to wanting to get into this cabin. You’ll happy to know it’s not even a disgusting diarrhea sprayed mess or overly foul smelling. The cold climate probably helps on that aspect. There’s even a roll of paper in there. Um, it’s not exactly the softest stuff though, and you’ll have to clean your hands in the snow.”\n“Lovely. Definitely not looking forward to the experience. So you see anything else of note on your outdoor adventures?”\n“I noticed foot prints going from this cabin and heading towards the east. I imagine they’re from the boots of the person who lives here. I’ve seen the same foot prints all over this immediate area, but those were going somewhere with a purpose rather than milling about taking care of every day chores around here I imagine.”\n“Wow, you’re tracker too huh? You really do know a little bit of everything.” You say.\n“I wouldn’t say I’m a tracker, I’m just sort of making guesses in the scheme of things. I just saw the prints in the snow and made the conclusion.”\n“You think the person living here is coming back?” you ask.\n“I dunno. I mean it’s possible, but I’m wondering if this place was abandoned. Seems like the door would have been locked. Of course the door can only be barred from the inside, so maybe that’s unavoidable and there generally aren’t many people wandering around here to worry about locks. Still, it seems like they would have hidden their pouch of coins better or even taken them with them.\n\nYou nod and there is a silent pause in the conversation.\n\nYou look back at the fire and Jack goes back to looking at the book. Probably the pair of you are wondering what the hell you’re going to do now. At least you are. Jack seems like he’s trying his hardest to make sense of everything and that’s certainly a good thing. You can’t help but think maybe you’re not pulling your weight as much as you can though, it’s just you don’t know what you’re supposed to be doing. It isn’t like you’ve ever been in a situation like this before.\n\nSo far you’ve just been trying to make the concentrated effort of not falling apart and giving in to despair because you get the impression no matter what happens, from here on out your life is going to be very different.\n\n“I know how to sew.” You suddenly blurt out.\n“What?” Jack responds.\n“I know how to sew, I mean I haven’t done it ever since my mother died, but you never forget something like that completely I suppose. My mother was the one who taught me, which is why I just sort of lost interest in it when she died.” You say.\n“Well that’s an interesting little fact you never told me about yourself when you were talking about your family before. What made you bring it up?”\n“Our situation I suppose. I mean I suppose at some point we’re going to need new clothes. I’ve never sewn furs together, but I suppose I’ll figure it out. I guess I just want to let you know I’m not completely useless and I will be contributing to our survival out here. I mean I’ll chop wood and learn to hunt and whatever else we need to do together.”\n“Suzy, you’re stressing about this too much. I mean yes, this situation isn’t the best, but trust me I’m just as worried if I’M going to be useful at all in this situation. I mean it’s only thanks to all the past weirdness I had to deal with due to that Gray Building that I even have some of the basic knowledge I have of various things and a good portion of that probably isn’t even going to be useful here.”\n\nJack gets up and goes over to sit with you and he takes your hand.\n\n“When it’s all said and done. We’re both a pair of basement dwellers and neither one of us was truly prepared for this, but we’re still going to get through it. I mean I like to think I’m a survivor on some level. And you, well I think you’ve more than proven to be one. I know you think it’s all just been luck or coincidence in that regard, but hell, maybe there’s a reason. Maybe there’s a reason for all this.”\n“You think so? You believe that all this is part of some plan?”\n“I dunno. Maybe it’s just a bunch of shit that happened. Still doesn’t mean we aren’t going to get through this.”\n\nYou look into Jack’s eyes and you take the initiative and kiss him full on the mouth. He reciprocates your affection, but you’re getting the strong impression that you might be the experienced one here.\n\nAnd then something urgent breaks up the moment.\n\n“Damn it.” You say.\n“What? Did I do something wrong?” Jack asks.\n“No. That thing that I wasn’t looking forward to has finally arrived.”\n“Wha…Oh. That. Um, well did you want me to come with you?”\n“You’re going to watch me go to the bathroom? Freak.”\n“No! I meant did you want me to come with you to show you the way or extra protection.”\n“I know what you meant, just joking. Yeah, I suppose you should come with me so you can at least show me where it is. Knowing me, I’d end up getting lost on the way there. Well alright come on, let’s go get this over with.” You say getting up.\n\nRemembering how cold it is out there, you grab a couple of the furs to wrap around you so you’re at least better protected this time. You go to grab your bat, but then you think if you shouldn’t take one of those spears instead.\n",
  "page 177": "Trader of TRASH\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“So that Bobby guy was really your ex-boyfriend? He was fucking creepy.” Jenny remarks as you drive away from the compound.\n“Yeah, well being head of a cult will do that I suppose. He wasn’t quite as creepy when I met him though. In any case it’s good that his sister Diana’s not in the picture anymore. I guarantee if she was still alive, this little peace between us and the Cult of Tiamat wouldn’t even be possible. Mel should be pleased about that.” You say.\n“Yeah, we even got some good stuff from them. I’m surprised he gave us as much clean water as he did….you think he still likes you?”\n\nYou laugh.\n\n“No, I’m fairly sure Tiamat is the only love of his life, with his sister Helen trailing behind, though maybe he did remember the good times we had together and decided to be generous with the supplies…or maybe this is all a trick and he actually poisoned the water with something hoping it’ll kill everyone.”\n“Oh shit! I didn’t even think about that! You think so?!” Jenny remarks.\n“Nah, I’m just joking. I mean I suppose it IS possible, but that’s not the cult’s style. Besides, if Bobby DID do that, he most likely would’ve secretly warned me so I don’t drink it at least.”\n“So you think it’s safe?”\n“I dunno. Doesn’t matter anyway since I’m going to go trade it to New Security for their fizzy soda. Can’t get that anywhere else and it’s not like we need anymore water, we currently have a good supply.”\n“See that’s why I like coming on these runs with you. It’s more interesting than just staying home listening to people argue all the time.” Jenny remarks.\n“Hm, trust me if I could, I’d rather stay home all the time, but unfortunately that’s not the way the world currently works that allows me to relive the days of my more carefree youth.” You say.\n\nAt this point Jenny asks you again about your “former life” but like you always tell her, there isn’t much to it. You didn’t do much, but you get the impression she’s just fascinated by the fact that you went from your humble beginning to what you currently do now along with all your survival skills you’ve acquired. Maybe it’s a bit inspiring for her, you don’t know. Though sometimes when you think about it, it is a little impressive.\n\n“Hey you ever think about revisiting your old house just out of curiosity?” Jenny asks.\n“Actually when all the crazy shit in town died down and there weren’t crazy cannibals running around everywhere, I did. I sort of made a detour there during one of my solo runs.”\n“Really? I never heard about that.”\n“Why would you? I never told anyone about it before. Anyway, I sort of went there partially out of curiosity, but also because my brother Ben built an underground shelter in the backyard of the place. Probably nothing the scale of one of those Ground Zero shelters like they used to annoyingly run ads for in the old days though.”\n“Yes, but didn’t you tell me your brother killed himself?”\n“Yeah, but knowing him, he probably still had that thing well stocked, so I figured it was worth a shot to look for. Unfortunately I looked and looked and looked in that backyard for hours and I couldn’t find the fucking entrance. I don’t know how the hell he moved it around and hid it like he did, but he did and like I said, I couldn’t find it. Who knows? Maybe it’s completely collapsed now anyway.”\n“So nobody was squatting in your house?”\n“Not that I could tell. There were a couple times where I felt like someone else was there, but nobody ever showed up. While there were some signs of natural decay and some things had obviously been looted everything else was mostly intact. My own room was completely vandalized though. I mean it looked like someone even tried to set the place on fire and there was some graffiti with the usual vulgarity on the walls. Sort of weird really and I didn’t stick around too long there. Guess it’s like they say, you can’t go home again.”\n“Well you have a new home anyway.” Jenny remarks.\n“Eh, I have a place to put my stuff and sleep, but I dunno if I’ll ever feel at home at the trailer park. I mean I get along better with everyone there now than I did, but I still just don’t fit in. The further I travel on these trading runs, I sometimes wonder if I shouldn’t just strike out on my own. I certainly have horded enough shit to be a travelling trader if I wanted to.”\n\nJenny at this point gives you a concerned look.\n\n“But you wouldn’t just suddenly leave like that would you?”\n\nYou look back at Jenny and you think about telling her that you don’t really have much attachment to where you live. It’s not even your long lost basement that you once loved so much. You also think about telling her you have even less attachment to most of the people who live there. Sure some of them are okay, and some you even get along better with than you did with your own family, but it’s not enough to keep you around.\n\nBut then you think, maybe that isn’t entirely true.\n\nJenny is about the same age you were when Donna just suddenly abandoned you. You remember when that happened you were a bit numb. Some of it wasn’t surprising, but nevertheless you did feel a great sense of betrayal due to believing you were building a new and stronger relationship with her at that time. You got over it pretty quickly mainly because there were so many other fires to put out at the time, but you didn’t ever forget.\n\nWhatever happened to Donna you suppose you’ll never know. Maybe she died, maybe she’s living well. Who knows?\n\nWhat you do know is over the years Jenny has sort of followed you around mainly due to her own mother basically not giving a shit about her and then later dying in an explosion due to Dan’s failed attempt to create a new “meth lab.”\n\nYou suppose she probably believes the pair of you have a bond too. Probably a bit more of misguided “hero worship” on her part and her ties to you are probably stronger than yours to her, but you aren’t going to do what Donna did to you.\n\n“Nah, I just think about it sometimes that’s all. I’m a bit too old to go traipsing across the nuclear wasteland, sleeping in a truck and worrying about fuel and the like on an everyday basis. However, if I ever do decide to leave, I’ll be sure to let you know.” You say.\n“So I could come with you?”\n“Yeah I suppose it would help to have someone watching my back if I was going to do it.”\n“I think that would be great adventure! And I don’t think you’re too old. If my mom was still alive you’d only be like a couple years younger than her. In fact sometimes I think of you as my…”\n\nYou tense up. You don’t want to hear that…\n\n“Stop. Just stop right there Jenny. Don’t even finish that sentence. I am NOT your mom.” You say with a stern look.\n“I wasn’t going to say that. I was going to say I sometimes think of you as my big sister that I never had.” Jenny remarks.\n\nYou cease being tense.\n\n“Oh. Well…okay. Yeah. I suppose that’s okay. I guess in some ways you’re like the younger sister I never had.” You respond with a smile.\n“But you did have a younger sister.”\n“Yeah and she was a slutty and ultimately selfish cunt. Like I said, you’re the younger sister I NEVER had.”\n\nWith a couple of minor chuckles from you and Jenny about this comment, the pair of you begin speaking about various things as you drive to your next destination.\n\nYou never imagined you’d wind up as a trader/scavenger for a trailer park community, but in the scheme of things it’s not that bad of a life in this new harsh world.\n",
  "page 179": "MONDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world hot dog eating championship! Let\u0027s all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe the mayonnaise off your lips, graciously stand up and bow for your adoring fans. The grossly fat dude on your right looks at you in disbelief and then turns away to puke in a bucket.\n\nMeanwhile the little Asian dude on your left just shakes his head wondering how the hell you could\u0027ve beaten him.\n\n\"I don\u0027t understand it...all my training. I glanced over at you during the contest...you...you were barely even chewing! How?\" He asks.\n\"Oh just natural talent at swallowing hot dogs I suppose.\" You reply humbly and wink at the audience, which continues to praise you.\n\nWhile you\u0027re blowing kisses at your fans, the announcer of the contest speaks again.\n\n\"And as an extra special reward, our glorious host of this event, Misty will be coming soon to congratulate our winner in person. This hasn\u0027t happened in decades! Perhaps even centuries! It\u0027s all just so exciting! Oh wait...I think that\u0027s Misty now!\"\n\nAt this point the wind begins to pick up significantly, which is amazing since this contest was taking place in an indoor stadium. The audience seems to be going even wilder, but at this point you\u0027re getting a little concerned.\n\nYour concern becomes fear when the fat bastard to your right melts into a gory pile of goo, the Asian guy\u0027s head gets really large like in one of those anime cartoons and he screams before running away shouting about Tokyo getting destroyed by a giant lizard.\n\nYou look back at the audience and see that they\u0027ve begun stripping off their clothes and embracing each other in the biggest orgy you\u0027ve ever seen. (Even larger than that porno you watched one time)\n\nThe roof suddenly comes off the stadium revealing a dark sky with a jet black swirling hole above.\n\n\"And here comes Misty folks! It\u0027s absolutely...GLORIOUS.\" The disembodied voice says as its pitch changes to demonic tone.\n\nYou can\u0027t run, you can\u0027t even move, you just stare at this unearthly sight like a deer in the headlights completely frozen.\n\nYou see the flash of a couple red glowing orbs in the black hole above you and then the wind picks you up and you\u0027re being pulled towards it.\n\n\"COME TO ME SUZY. COME TO US. COME. COME. COME...\" A deep voice echoes all around you which is backed up by the audience who are chanting along with having their orgy.\n\nYou vainly try to struggle, but there isn\u0027t much you can do accept uselessly flail about in midair as you are slowly enveloped by darkness. Even when you try to scream, you make no sound, in fact all your senses go numb and everything goes black.\n\nYou are then awakened by the ringing of your phone. At first you look around briefly still wondering if you\u0027re still levitating towards a black hole, but you breathe a sigh of relief that it was all just a dream.\n\nHowever, even though you\u0027re wide-awake, you still feel shaken up. Something about that dream seemed really unnerving and you usually aren\u0027t one to put much stock into your dreams.\n\nThe ringing of the phone takes priority before dream analysis though, so after fumbling with it a bit you answer it.\n\n\"Hey I\u0027ve been trying to get a hold of you. We\u0027re you still asleep?\" Bobby asks.\n\"Yeah, are you outside the house already?\" You answer.\n\"Nah, I\u0027m on my way over. I hope you\u0027re packed and ready to go though, because it\u0027s nuts out here. I know you don\u0027t tend to leave the house much, but if you\u0027ve been out lately, you\u0027d know it\u0027s been getting fucking crazy in town. Seriously, you\u0027ll see how fucked up it is out there when we drive through town. The cops are everywhere, groups of people are rioting, like I said, it\u0027s a mess. Okay, I need to focus on the road, there\u0027s a meat wagon picking up some bodies off the road. I\u0027ll see you soon. Love you.\" Bobby says and hangs up.\n\nAs you take a quick shower before getting ready to leave, you think more about your strange dream. You wonder if it was some sort of subconscious thing that your mind was telling you that this move is a bad idea. You have to admit, you still are feeling very unsure about it, especially now that Bobby has told you that you\u0027re moving into an isolated compound with not just his immediate family, but a bunch of other family that could be even crazier.\n\nStill, this could just be mostly anxiety of leaving a place where you\u0027ve traditionally always felt safe and lived most of your life combined with a freaky dream. Bobby did say you could leave if you weren\u0027t comfortable there, so you\u0027re trying to not to focus on the possible negatives.\n\nYou try to calm your nerves the old fashioned way and think about Bobby the entire time.\n\nExiting the shower, getting dressed and grabbing your packed bags, you finally leave your basement. You packed as much as you could, hopefully you can return to get the rest later.\n\nYou head upstairs and you\u0027re not waiting long before you hear a knock on the door. Upon answering it, you see Bobby who embraces you with a hug and a kiss.\n\n\"By Tiamat, I\u0027ve missed your body against mine.\" Bobby says caressing you all over.\n\"I never would have guessed. I have missed your touch as well though Bobby. Let me just get my bags.\"\n\nYou turn around and bend over to grab your bags and that\u0027s when Bobby grabs you around the waist and if it wasn\u0027t for the fabric separating the two of you, he\u0027d also be inside you. It\u0027s startling enough that you probably would\u0027ve lost you balance had Bobby not been holding on to you so tightly.\n\n\"What the hell? Sheesh Bobby, I nearly fell forward on my face!\"\n\"You wouldn\u0027t have, I got you. Mmm, I just can\u0027t help myself, I just...\" At this point Bobby starts kissing on your neck and groping you.\n\"Bobby, Bobby, stop. My brother Peter is still here in the connected garage. Last thing I need is for him to hear us and then suddenly walk in on me getting plowed from behind. Besides, didn\u0027t you say it\u0027s getting crazy out there? Shouldn\u0027t we be getting the hell out of town?\"\n\"Yeah, it\u0027s wonderfully chaotic out there. Like Tiamat herself has blessed this town. It really started putting me in the mood and then seeing you...well how can I not want to make love to you in the midst of all this chaos?\"\n\nBobby at this point is trying pull your shirt off over your head and you hear the sound of a zipper being unzipped, though with as excited as he is, you dare say it could just impale you through his pants. He\u0027s grunting, slobbering all over your neck and sniffing your hair and...well he REALLY wants you right now.\n\nThis isn\u0027t really what you had in mind and something about the way Bobby is behaving is a bit...animalistic. He\u0027s never been that way in your other intimate encounters with him. Well not excessively so at any rate.\n\nAlso, you HAVE been fighting for awhile, and it\u0027s sort of presumptuous of him to just think you\u0027re going to spread your legs immediately because you\u0027re on good terms again.\n\nThen again, this is sort of turning you on right now, and it has been awhile for you. (By something not battery operated or your own hands at least)\n",
  "page 181": "You might be Bobby’s girlfriend, but you’re not his fuck toy. You’re not going to just give in because he happens to be horny right now.\n\n“Bobby, fucking STOP! Seriously! I’m not in the mood!” you say and pull yourself away from his arms.\n\nAt first he look hurt by your rejection, then his face turns to one of anger.\n\n“What the fuck? I thought we were back together?!” Bobby exclaims.\n“Exactly! We JUST got back together! I mean we got a lot of shit to talk about before we can just hop in the sack again!”\n“Are you fuckin’ kidding…Suzy I just told you that you don’t need to worry about Diana if that’s what you’re still on about!”\n“It’s not just about her, but that’s certainly part of it. It’s about not treating me like some glory hole because your dick’s hard!”\n“Suzy, you know that’s not even the fucking case. And since when are you not into me being affectionate with you? Shit, you were probably splittin’ the kitten and thinking about me before I even came over here! Now maybe YOU can turn your feelings on and off, but I genuinely missed you! Excuse me if I want to express that in a physical way!”\n“Bobby, I can’t turn my feelings on and off, and this isn’t one sided. I missed you too, but we still have things to work out before we can just continue as normal.”\n\nAt this point Bobby rubs his hands over his face.\n\n“(Sigh) You know what…fine. I’m not arguing with you. Play your little game. Let’s just get your shit and get over to the compound.”\n\nBobby’s obviously mad about not getting any sex from you, but at least he isn’t pointing out how you should “give it up” because he’s helping you out or something similar.\n\nBobby grabs some of your bags and you grab the rest and the pair of you leave out the front door. Bobby silently loads your bags in the van and the pair of you gets in equally as silent.\n\nYou break up the silence by mentioning how crazy the town seems as you drive through it. And it is pretty crazy. You’re seeing police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and large groups of people fighting. This has to be the liveliest this town has ever been.\n\n“Wow, you weren’t kidding about it being nuts out here.” You say.\n“Yeah.” Bobby says.\n\nYou don’t say anymore since it seems like he’s content on sulking, but then he surprises you.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry for being an aggressive asshole back there. I just got overly excited I guess.” Bobby says.\n“Well I suppose I can’t blame you, I am pretty hot.” You say which causes a smile between the both of you.\n\n“And I want to say, I’m really glad you’re helping me out by letting me move in with you.” You say.\n“Don’t even mention it. I mean I would’ve wanted you to move in sooner…well anyway it’s probably best we’re doing this now. This compound is a lot bigger. You’ll be happy to know you can have perfect solitude to yourself and not be bothered by anyone.”\n“Nice.” you respond.\n“And you’re right, we probably do have a lot to talk about and we can do that and address all your concerns when we get there. We’ll work everything out.” Bobby says and smiles again with an optimistic tone.\n\nFor a moment there’s another pause of silence and you think about how Bobby is a pretty great boyfriend in the scheme of things. So you come to a decision.\n\n“So…you want a blowjob?” you ask.\n“What?” Bobby says being caught completely off guard.\n“Well I can see from here you’re fidgeting with your man parts every two seconds while driving. That either means you got some severe issues with your underwear or you’re still horny.”\n“My underwear is fine.”\n“Well that pretty much leaves one option. So you want one or not?”\n“I always want a blowjob, but now? I mean the streets are pretty fucking crazy right now and I’m trying to concentrate on the road.”\n“Well you’re not concentrating completely on the road now, because you’re still groping yourself.” You say.\n“What about all that stuff about not being a fuck toy?” Bobby asks.\n“Oh that was when you all over me, this is different because it’s my idea.” You say.\n“…I’m not even going to argue with your female logic, I’m just going to say yes.” Bobby responds.\n\n“Smart boy.” You say with a smile and slowly slide over to Bobby and start unzipping his pants. Fortunately there’s enough room for your head so you aren’t going to be constantly hitting the back of it against the steering wheel.\n\nConsidering Bobby’s pretty ready as soon as you pull it out, you get right to it and start doing what…well one of the many things Bobby loves you for. You focus on the job at hand and you can hear Bobby making some sounds of enjoyment as you really start to get into it.\n\nAny other time, this probably would’ve been a nice little thing for Bobby and probably a way for you to gain leverage in the next disagreement the pair of you would have inevitably had in a future about something. Blowjobs are the keystone to any successful relationship after all.\n\nHowever this probably wasn’t the best time to showcase your dick sucking skills.\n\nAs you’re deep throating Bobby into ecstasy, he’s having an incredibly hard time paying as much attention to the road. Normally he probably wouldn’t have been an issue in this normally sleepy town, but with as crazy as the streets are right now, he doesn’t see the fire truck barreling down the side street and smashing right into his side\n\nBobby’s van is hit with great force and actually topples over twice. In the process you end up biting Bobby’s dick off and choking on it. Bobby is somewhat lucky in that he was knocked unconscious on impact, but he’s not going to survive long due to several severe wounds and that’s not even including his dick getting bit off.\n\nYou’re also in no condition to even move now due to several broken bones, and your last moments are gasping for breath with a dismembered dick lodged in your throat.\n",
  "page 180": "It\u0027s not like this is a complete stranger, this is someone you do have feelings for and what the hell, it\u0027s not like you aren\u0027t going to be doing this again with him eventually. Still, there is the matter of decorum.\n\nYou manage to twist your body around so that you\u0027re face to face to him; he barely stops when you tell him.\n\n\"Bobby, look we can do this, but like I said, we\u0027re NOT doing this in the middle of the living room. Let\u0027s at least go down to the basement and we can fuck on my couch.\"\n\"Okay, okay, whatever, let\u0027s just get down their quickly.\" Bobby agrees continuing to kiss on you.\n\nThe pair of you head down into the basement and one of Bobby\u0027s hands is practically glued to your ass the entire time.\n\nWhen you get to your room, you see that Bobby has somehow managed to strip off most of his clothing by this point (amazing considering he had one hand on your ass the entire time). He helpfully starts stripping your clothing off.\n\n\"Well seeing as you\u0027re obviously taking the alpha male approach to this, after you\u0027re done tearing off my clothes, you can carry me over to the sofa and start doing me like a conquering warrior. I want to see your face stare into mine as you thrust into me, let me know who exactly is in charge and teach me a lesson.\" You say licking your index finger and then running your finger down Bobby\u0027s chest.\n\n(Never let it be said that you can\u0027t tap into your dirty side when necessary)\n\nThe next half hour is fun, if a little rougher than you\u0027re used to with Bobby.\n\nIt starts off with him just really ramming it into you and telling you in various ways to \"Take it.\" while staring directly into your eyes which are more piercing than usual. His hands are also mostly holding down your wrists at this point.\n\nDespite all this, you aren\u0027t scared. You just wrap your legs around him tightly like a boa constrictor and enjoy the ride.\n\nA little later he put his hands around your neck and even squeezes a little while continuing to stare into your eyes. You can certainly still breathe, but he is definitely establishing his dominance and that he is firmly in control of things.\n\nDespite all this, you still aren\u0027t really scared, you even add to the \"experience\" by squeaking out a \"No.\" \"Please don\u0027t.\" \"Stop hurting me.\" every now and then.\n\nEventually Bobby chants something in a language you\u0027ve never heard before and then orgasms. Again, not really scary since he\u0027s always doing that. It was weird the first few times you had sex with him but now it acts as a nice little alarm letting you know that things will be over soon.\n\nCompletely spent after orgasm, Bobby collapses on top of you and begins hugging you tightly, and then whispers...\n\n\"I love you so much Suzy, I want us to be joined forever. I want our bodies as well as our souls to be married.\"\n\nNOW you get scared and suddenly push him off of you in alarm at this declaration.\n\n\"What?! Married?\" You exclaim recoiling to one corner of the couch.\n\nBobby\u0027s a little surprised by your reaction.\n\n\"I want us to be married. I mean we\u0027re obviously soul mates and its the next logical step for us.\"\n\"Step? What step? We were just having fun a moment ago and now you spring life long commitment?\"\n\"Are you saying you never saw us eventually getting married? I mean in all that time since we\u0027ve been together?\"\n\"No, and especially not when all the trouble with your sister came about.\"\n\"But on several occasions you asked me to run away with you! You didn\u0027t think we\u0027d get married if we ever did that even?\"\n\"Not really.\"\n\"I\u0027m guessing you didn\u0027t ever think about having children either then.\"\n\"Children?! What the hell, you think I\u0027m some sort of brood mother?\n\nNow Bobby is downright confused.\n\n\"Suzy... I really don\u0027t understand your... well view of things...\" Bobby says.\n\"That pretty rich coming from the cultist.\" You say.\n\"Okay, I\u0027m going to ignore that because I love you. But if it makes any difference, at least I still behave in a consistent way which you do not.\"\n\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n\"(Sigh) I really don\u0027t want us to fight again...\"\n\"Bobby I just let you simulate what could be considered a rape fantasy on me, the least you can do is explain yourself.\"\n\"Okay then THAT right there is what I\u0027m talking about. You have no problem with having kinky sex with me, you have no major problems with my religion and what it entails, you\u0027re even willing to move in with me and my family even though you\u0027re concerned about my sister and probably the rest of them, but somehow marriage is what is freaking you out? I mean I\u0027m trying to do the right thing here and it\u0027s because I genuinely love you. Why are you so resistant?\"\n\nIt\u0027s actually a good question. You\u0027re pretty tolerant of a lot of stuff most would\u0027ve recoiled in horror from and something like marriage and (shudder) kids is scaring you off. There\u0027s probably a good psychological reason for your reluctance, involving your observations of other married couples such as your own mother (overly compliant) and father (distant) or your brother Ben (paranoid psychotic) and his wife (utterly clueless) but there are a few other concerns.\n\n\"Bobby...you\u0027ve never brought up marriage before either, why all of a sudden?\" You ask.\n\"Well, I just think it\u0027s time. I mean we\u0027ve been together awhile. We\u0027ve stuck together through ups and downs. We\u0027re going to be living together. I obviously love you and I assume you love me right?\"\n\"Well...yeah...but... I dunno...I mean kids? Come on do you really think I\u0027m mother material? I can barely take care of myself...in fact I can\u0027t at all, otherwise I wouldn\u0027t be in this situation in the first place.\"\n\nAt this point Bobby takes your hand into his and gets closer to you.\n\"Suzy, don\u0027t you see, you don\u0027t need to worry about any of that anymore. When you marry me you won\u0027t have to worry about taking care of yourself ever again. And as far as being mother material, I can\u0027t imagine a better mother to my children. Even if you do have trouble, I\u0027m sure my sisters will help out...well okay Helen will help out, but you know what I\u0027m saying. The main thing is you won\u0027t have any more worries when you\u0027re in the family...MY family. We\u0027ll look after you. I\u0027ll look after you.\"\n\nAnd there it is. Your future. A \"housewife\" popping out a whole mess of little cultists like a Pez dispenser. While it might not be quite that extreme, the writing is on the wall. While Bobby is probably sincere in his love and desire to care for you, he\u0027s still the head of a human sacrificing cult and as such he\u0027s going to be somewhat controlling and manipulative.\n\nHow long before you become brainwashed into believing in the same shit he believes in? How long before you passively accept other sudden changes over time? Hell, how long before some organization like the FBI or the ATF comes charging in to lay siege to the place?\n\nThough on the other hand what are you really doing with your life right now and what prospects do you really have? You could do worse than have a man who obviously loves you a lot and is willing to take care of the stuff you don\u0027t want to bother worrying about.\n\nYou\u0027ve got a major life changing decision to make, because you get the impression that if you get into that compound of his, changing you mind isn\u0027t going to be an option.\n",
  "page 183": "\"Okay, Bobby. I suppose you\u0027re right. We both love each other and that\u0027s the most important thing...so yes. I\u0027ll marry you.\" You say.\n\nBobby is overjoyed and hugs and kisses you.\n\n\"Oh Suzy, this is fantastic! I\u0027ll make the announcement to everyone as soon as we get to the compound! I got the ring there and we\u0027ll make it official as soon as we\u0027re all settled in. In fact, this Friday should be perfect! I hope that’s good with you.”\n“Um…yeah this Friday is fine.” You answer.\n“Tiamat truly blesses her most worthy servants! Come on let\u0027s get going!\" Bobby exclaims.\n\nBobby immediately starts grabbing his clothing that he left in various places in the basement on the way to your room and getting dressed. Your own clothing is a bit torn now, so you grab some new clothes that were still in your closet.\n\nHeading back upstairs, Bobby picks up your bags and carries them to this van. He opens the door for you and everything. You did miss his attention to the little things like that.\n\nAs soon as you leave your neighborhood you notice what Bobby was talking about the town. He wasn\u0027t kidding when he said it’s a mess. You see police trying maintain order, fights, car wrecks, fire fighters trying put out fires and ambulances blaring their sirens.\n\nAs Bobby focuses on the road, he goes on about how everything that\u0027s currently going on in town is just a small sample of what\u0027s to come. He talks about how there are several wars are going on in the world and how tensions are at an all time high. (He actually sounds like one of those Ground Zero infomercials on that bit) He mentions how everything is always trending towards chaos and entropy and how the signs that Tiamat is finally coming back to return the world to its natural state. Between your recent acceptance of his proposal and this, you don\u0027t think you\u0027ve ever seen him so happy and excited.\n\n\"Well whatever\u0027s going on, I\u0027m glad we are leaving town, it\u0027s like everyone here has lost their mind.\" You say.\n\"Yeah, some of my family don\u0027t agree that we should go to the compound. Some say we should be out here personally embracing the increasing chaos in the world like Tiamat would want, but... as I said there aren\u0027t a lot of us and I\u0027d still like to make sure we\u0027re relatively safe. I believe Tiamat would want her chosen to be smart about things. Build up our numbers over time and THEN we will rise to become a force that none can oppose.\"\n\nYou don\u0027t say much, you just nod and smile. You imagine you\u0027re going to be directly contributing to those \"numbers.\" You cross your legs at the thought.\n\nEventually you manage to get out of town and things are slightly better and the traffic is even thinning out. You\u0027ve never been north of town before...actually you\u0027ve never been out of town before. You also never realized how rural of an area you lived in.\n\nThe quiet calm of the great outdoors is actually a little scarier than the chaos of the town you just left behind, doesn\u0027t help that it\u0027s getting dark by this point.\n\nBobby ends up turning off the main road to an unsaved dirt one leading further into wilderness. Just as you\u0027re wonder how much further, you see the compound (surrounded by a high fence with razor wire of course) and it\u0027s certainly big enough and imposing enough to make any cult leader jealous.\n\n\"Shit, it looks like a small prison.\" You say.\n\"Yeah my dad and some of his brothers were constantly adding on to this thing for decades. To be honest, it isn\u0027t even completely finished. I mean it\u0027s more than sufficient for several people to comfortably live in, but there are many rooms that are just the bare minimum of four walls. Towards the back where you can\u0027t see from here, there are some portions of it that are exposed to the outside. However, seeing as there will be a bunch of us living here now, I think we\u0027ll at least be able to finish the place up, and in time make even more additions.\"\n\"Didn\u0027t know your dad had brothers.\"\n\"Yeah three older, and one younger. A younger sister too, but none of them will be coming here.\"\n\"Oh. Wait, all of them are dead?\"\n\"No, the two younger siblings, Uncle Leslie and Aunt Lilith are still alive. In fact Leslie and Lilith live in a house together south of town. But let\u0027s just say they aren\u0027t exactly believers in the faith and chose a different path instead...I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard of the Ground Zero corporation especially with all their annoying infomercials and ads everywhere nowadays.\"\n\"Wait, seriously? You\u0027ve got family that works for GZ? You never told me that before either.\" You ask.\n\"My dad wasn\u0027t really on speaking terms with either of them. Long story. Anyway, technically just Aunt Lilith works for GZ. Dunno doing what, but I think it\u0027s important. Uncle Leslie just lives with her and spends most of his time indulging in his pointless experiments, though I know he does some black market organ shit on the side.\" Bobby explains.\n\"I guess you couldn\u0027t get your aunt to pull a few strings and get set up in one of those shelters they\u0027re always trying to sell huh?\" You say.\n\"Actually I did contact her during the recent family video conference. She told me that we\u0027d all be much better off in dad\u0027s slightly unfinished compound than in one of those shelters. Apparently half of those things are death traps or something. She said even though she wasn\u0027t a believer, she still didn\u0027t want to subject her nieces and nephews to the fate of being in one of those live-in mass coffins.\"\n\"Well that was nice of her to look out for you.\"\n\"Yeah, she always was one of the nicest people in our family. Dunno why she\u0027s with Uncle Leslie, the guy is a psychotic asshole to practically everyone. Good doctor though. Anyway, let\u0027s see who\u0027s on duty tonight.\" Bobby says pulling up to the large gate.\n\nBobby rolls down his window and speaks into an intercom.\n\n\"Hey, it\u0027s Bobby. Anyone there?\"\n\"Bobby? Where the hell have you been? Thought you were going back into town and coming straight back to help with arranging all this furniture.\" A voice replies a few moments later.\n\"Yeah well I had something really important to do and town is crazy right now. Did anyone else show up since yesterday?\"\n\"Nah, but a few people called saying they were going to get in by tomorrow at least.\"\n\"Okay, what\u0027s everyone else doing right now?\"\n\"Um, well mostly everyone\u0027s asleep or otherwise retired to their rooms. Except me who drew the short straw to keep a look out for you.\"\n\"What?! Asleep already? It\u0027s not that late!\" Bobby exclaims.\n\"Well everyone was a bit tired from all the moving around. Also your sister Helen felt the young ones should get a good night\u0027s sleep earlier since there\u0027s more shit to do tomorrow.\"\n\"Hmm, well I had a big announcement to make, but I suppose if everyone is mostly in dreamland right now, it can wait until tomorrow. Might as well anyway seeing as you said more people are supposed to show up. Okay let us in William.\"\n\"Us, huh? I guess that means you have a certain lady with you? Oh Tiamat, can\u0027t wait to see Diana\u0027s reaction to that one.\" William remarks.\n\"Diana\u0027s gonna just have to fucking deal with it, I\u0027m the fucking head of this family and I love this woman!\"\n\"Sheesh, calm down Bobby. I got no problem with that. I will just ask one thing, is she one of us?\"\n\nBobby looks over at you which puts you a bit on the spot.\n\n\"I love you Bobby, and I go where you go now.\" You say which is enough of a positive answer for Bobby who has a big grin due to your answer.\n\n\"Yes, of course she is.\" Bobby remarks.\n\"Well then she\u0027s alright with me. Come on in around the right side, you\u0027ll be less likely to wake up the others and nobody is using that side of the building right now, so you\u0027ll have that big bedroom over there all to yourself.\"\n\nAnd with that the large gate slides open and Bobby drives you both in. He passes a few parked cars on his way over to the right wing of the compound and parks a few feet in front of a large door. You and he both get out.\n\nYou attempt to get your bags, but again he insists on carrying them for you. He hands you the keys to the door to open it though, which you do and you both enter.\n\nAfter turning on a light switch, Bobby takes the lead.\n\n\"Come on, down this corridor and through a couple of rooms.\"\n\"This place isn\u0027t quite as spartan as I imagined. You\u0027ve got some rather nice carpeting and even the wall coloring is fairly cheerful.\" You say walking and looking around.\n\"I told you, this is our home, and we have to live here comfortably. We\u0027re not trying to create a psychologically oppressive effect to break down the willpower of potential followers, so what\u0027s the point of having a depressing drab gray everywhere?\"\n\"Makes sense. The artwork you got up is pretty...interesting as well.\" You say glancing at the various strange pictures hanging up ranging from multi headed dragons to gory scenes of sacrifices.\n\"Oh, yeah. My grandmother painted most of these.\" Bobby replies.\n\"Really? Well, she certainly made some vivid scenes. That one with young raven haired naked lady holding the bloody dagger surrounded by the corpses is pretty detailed. Probably the best one of the bunch.\" You say being supportive.\n\"It should be the best one considering that\u0027s a self portrait of her. Took her a few months to finish it apparently because she wanted to get the color of decay just right for the bodies. Yep, she sure was talented.\"\n\nBobby stares a bit at his long dead grandmother\u0027s naked image for a moment until you wave your hand in front of him.\n\n\"Sorry, it\u0027s a bit hypnotic at times. Like the eyes follow you.\" Bobby says.\n\"Hrmmm. Sure it\u0027s not two other things?\" You ask.\n\"Ha ha, well gotta admit, Grandma was pretty hot back in the day.\"\n\"That...would be disturbing even if I wasn\u0027t your soon to be wife.\" You remark. (Though you’re not really THAT disturbed given what you know of Bobby’s family)\n\"Oh I\u0027m joking, you know you\u0027re the only one for me.\" Bobby says and kisses you on the cheek before saying you\u0027ll be heading up some nearby stairs.\n\nA flight of stairs, another corridor, a few rooms later and you\u0027re finally at your destination. A fully furnished master bedroom with all the comforts.\n\n\"Well gotta admit, this is a very nice room. A little heavy on the red coloring, but I\u0027ll definitely be comfortable here especially since I\u0027m starting to get tired.\"\n\"Hey go ahead and relax. You\u0027re home now. I\u0027d join you, but I think I better go see my cousin William to get a proper update on what\u0027s been going on, so I\u0027ll be back later.\"\n\"Okay then.\" you say stretching out on the bed.\n\nBobby kisses you goodbye and you\u0027re alone at last.\n\nYou think about grabbing your laptop, but the bag it\u0027s in is too far and you\u0027re far too comfortable so you just spend your time scanning the room with your eyes thinking about your situation.\n\nWhen you look over to your left you notice another self portrait of Grandma Morningstar. Fortunately, she\u0027s got all her clothes on in this one and is in a more traditional pose. Same stern and confident look though.\n\n\"Well I guess I\u0027ll be joining the family officially soon. Hope you approve from...well wherever you guys go when you shuffle off this mortal coil.\" You say towards the direction of the painting, though you don\u0027t look at it too long. Bobby\u0027s right, there is something a little hypnotic about the pictures of her.\n\nInstead you close your eyes as the comfort of the bed and silence causes you to soon fall asleep.\n",
  "page 185": "TUESDAY\n\n\nYour alarm goes off and you groggily wake up.\n\nWay earlier than you’re used to actually. It’s morning and you haven’t been up this early in a long time. You’re surprised you didn’t just sleep through the alarm considering how emotionally drained you were yesterday. Even now, you still feel tired.\n\nYou’re also still pretty damn depressed. Depression combined with your type of ingrained apathy would normally make for a really bad combination of motivation, but against all odds, you actually get up out of bed to go wash up.\n\nYou spend an extra long time in the shower trying to motivate yourself for the first phase of your goals today which is heading over to Jake’s comic shop and getting a job.\n\nEventually you finish up and head back to your room where you start to get dressed, thinking about one of your other possible goals which is finding a new place to live because if this comic shop thing doesn’t work out, you doubt if you’re going to find anything else you’d be willing to do before the week is over.\n\nAlways one to seek the way of least resistance, you reluctantly call your sister Donna since she did say you could live with her and Julie. You didn’t really want to go live with her and Julie though because you know it’s going to be party central non-stop, but you don’t have many other options.\n\nYou ring up Donna several times and get no answer. You ring up Julie and also get no answer. They’re probably both passed out from whatever they were doing the night before. You give up attempting to contact them today, deciding that you’ll just show up on their doorstep with all your shit if you don’t get this job. It’s not much of a plan, but you do feel slightly better believing you have a safety net. Well you like to THINK you have a safety net anyway.\n\nWith that fear partially quelled, you absent-mindedly check to see if Bobby called…then you stop…\n\n“Christ, that was stupid. Get your head straight Suzy…” you say to yourself, starting to feel bad again. You then remind yourself that you’ll have to break that habit.\n\nYou nearly delete his number entirely, but you can’t quite bring yourself to do it just yet.\n\nPushing through it all, you now move on to your next step of trying to convince your brother Peter to let you borrow his car so you drive over to the comic shop.\n\nYou head upstairs and bang on the door to the garage.\n\n“Hey Peter, open up I need a favor!” you shout and after a few seconds the door opens up.\n“What the fuck Suzy? Why the hell are you banging on my door like you’re the police?” Peter exclaims peeking his head out the door. He’s probably naked.\n“Yeah, sorry to bother you with whatever currently doing at the moment, but I need to borrow your car. I’m trying to get a job.” You say.\n“A job? I thought you were too much of a prude to be a stripper.”\n“Ha ha, very funny. I’m not going to be a stripper, I’m going to try to get a job at a Jake’s comic shop.” You reply.\n“A comic shop? Doing what? Getting all the virgin nerds excited?”\n“I’m going to be moving boxes or working a register…look I don’t fucking know exactly, I haven’t gotten the job yet. I just know I NEED to get this fucking job or else Kelly’s gonna throw me out on my ass!” you reply getting increasingly exasperated.\n“Alright, fine. Don’t fucking bite my goddamn head off because you got problems. I’ve got problems of my own. (Sigh) Wait a minute.”\n\nPeter closes the door and then a few seconds later opens it up and then tosses some keys at you.\n\n“Here. Don’t fuck it up, and I fully expect you to put gas in it.” He says and then slams the door shut.\n\nWell that was easier than you expected, but then he probably just wanted you out of the way for whatever client he has coming over.\n\nWith that out of the way, you get in Peter’s car and pull out of the driveway.\n\nA few minutes of driving to your destination and you now learn first hand what Bobby was talking about yesterday. The roads are a mess and the town is in fucking chaos. There are cops everywhere, as well as ambulances and fire trucks racing to their various destinations too. You’re also seeing small groups of people rioting. It’s like the whole town has lost its damn mind and you nearly get into an accident more than a few times. Fortunately Jake’s comic shop isn’t too far away, but given the town’s situation you’re hoping that everything there isn’t going to be as bad as what you’ve been seeing so far.\n\nEventually you do get to the shop and so far the place doesn’t look too bad, though given that you see a police barricade a few blocks up the street, you wonder if that could all change. Pulling into the parking lot, you exit the car and enter the building.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you briefly scan the shop and find it completely empty save for a bearded middle-aged man with a ponytail at a counter staring at you. He couldn’t be more of a stereotype of a “comic book guy.”\n\n“Well…hello. You lost or something? The beauty salon is down the street…though I believe there was a shooting or something there earlier.” He says.\n“Um, no. I’m here about the job. Are you Jake?” you ask.\n“That’s me. Now what job are you talking about exactly?” Jake asks while looking at you up and down. The guy is already probably thinking several dirty thoughts about you and at this point you’re really hoping this guy doesn’t turn the whole job thing into some stupid line about giving him a blowjob.\n\n“The job openings I found on the internet for this place. It said you needed someone to move boxes or work the register.” You say.\n“Oh yeah, I’m not even sure why I posted that. In this current economy I can barely afford to hire one employee and lately I’m wondering if I can even do that.” Jake says.\n“Shit, does this mean you’re not hiring?”\n“Well…considering you’re easy on the eyes, I’m not going to say I’m NOT hiring. Besides you’re the only one that’s even applied so far. You’d think with all the fanboy nerds that practically live at this place one of them would’ve offered to fucking help me out. (Sigh) Whatever, you got your resume?”\n“Resume?” you ask.\n“Yeah, when people tend to apply for jobs they usually have one. I mean not that any of the tasks here are brain surgery, but it’s nice to have some basic information.” Jake says.\n“Oh. Well I don’t have one.” You reply.\n“Seriously? You came in here for a job without a resume?”\n“I didn’t think I’d need one.”\n“You didn’t…alright can you give me any references then?”\n“Um, no.”\n“You can’t or you won’t?”\n“I can’t because I don’t have any.”\n“Jesus Christ…do you have ANY job experience whatsoever?”\n“No.”\n“Do you even want a fucking job here?” Jake asks getting exasperated.\n“Not really, but I want to run around half naked swinging on a pole getting ogled, slobbered over and groped by horny guys for a living even less, so this place is currently my only option for my desperate situation.” You say.\n\nJake laughs at your comment.\n\n“Well at least your honest, but if you think you’re not going to get ogled and slobbered over by guys here, you’re sadly mistaken. You do realize this is a comic shop right?”\n“Oh come on, there has to be female customers that come in here.” You say.\n“Sure, but they don’t look like you and you’ll probably get a couple of them awkwardly hitting on you as well. On the bright side, none of the nerds here are probably going to try to grope you. They’ll be far too shy to try that. No pole swinging either, but feel free to run around half naked. I guarantee something like that would really help out business.” Jake says with a smirk.\n“Yeah, not happening.” You reply.\n“Didn’t think I’d be that lucky. Well despite your total lack of skill, I suppose I’ll hire you, I do have to ask one thing first though…”\n\nAnd here it comes; he’s going to ask you to do something sexual and you’ll be heading out the door…\n\n“Do you even read comics?”\n\nWell that was unexpected.\n\n“Well, I used to when I was little, but my older sister Kelly just kept taking them from me and either hitting me with them or tearing them up, so I didn’t see the point anymore.” You reply.\n“Jeez, that’s not fucking right. You should’ve kicked her ass.” Jake says.\n“Yeah well that wasn’t possible, she’s ten times bigger than me. In fact that’s why I applied to this job, she’s threatening to kick me out of the house.” You say.\n“Hmm, sounds like a similar situation that I had with my last assistant. His mom was threatening to kick him out of the house and he begged me to hire him. He was a pathetic little worm addicted to all that anime shit. Really he was a lousy helper, but given that the one I had before him just died in my bathroom, I figured I’d give the fat little anime addict a shot.”\n“Wait someone died in the bathroom here?” you ask.\n“Yeah my retarded assistant strangled himself in my bathroom while jacking off. Spent the damn day cleaning the bathroom because of it.”\n“Uh, the other assistant didn’t die in the bathroom too did he?”\n“Nah, he ended up marrying his crazy cousin and lives in the trailer park outside of town I think. Dunno what he does now since he never comes in anymore which is a shame since the pervert used to spend a fortune in this place.”\n\n“That’s…interesting. So about the job.” You say steering the conversation back on track.\n“Yeah, about the job. I’m guessing you’ll want to be working the register…what is your name anyway blondie?”\n“Suzy, and why are you assuming I want to be working the register?”\n“Because I doubt a little thing like you really wants to be lugging boxes around, I mean unless you’re trying to tell me you can’t do basic math.”\n“Of course I know how to do basic fucking math!” you snap.\n“Okay, sheesh. Calm down I didn’t mean to imply anything. So you’re working the register…”\n\nJake has still already made the decision for you about what job you’re going to be doing and while lugging boxes around really doesn’t appeal to you, you’re still a little insulted that the option has just been taken away from you.\n\nBesides the sexist implications that you aren’t strong enough to do the other job because you’re female, you get the strong impression that Jake also just wants you at the register so you’ll be more visible to all the horny virgin nerds that come in this place.\n\nAnd the more you’re thinking about the fact that you’ll have to interact with the public in general if you’re working the register you’re finding it about as appealing as lifting a bunch of heavy boxes around.\n\nThen again if you antagonize Jake over this, he might just throw you out of the shop and then you’ll have no job.\n",
  "page 184": "You love Bobby…well at least you think you do. He’s been your only boyfriend so you don’t have any other real comparison.\n\nBut even if you do love him, you still don’t think you’re ready to marry him at least not on the terms he wants.\n\n“Can’t we just…I dunno…runaway together?” you ask.\n“What? I don’t understand, I thought you loved me.” Bobby says.\n“I do, but marriage…that’s a really big step…and all my other concerns aside I still don’t feel comfortable living with your sister. I mean maybe it would be different if it were just us and no other ties. I might even feel comfortable starting a family with you with a clean slate as it were.”\n“Suzy…that’s just not possible. First of all I already have a perfectly good home that’s fully stocked with necessities, why the hell would I just abandon it? That would be dumb just from a logical standpoint and just because you don’t want anything to do with your worthless family, I still love mine and I’m not going to just abandon them.”\n“Worthless? Yeah, I don’t think highly of them either, but don’t you dare come in and start claiming superiority! At least my family isn’t a bunch of inbred brainwashed murderers. And fuck you Bobby, if you REALLY wanted to, we could fucking run away together. You’re a resourceful guy.”\n“Oh I’m a resourceful guy huh? Well maybe I am, but what are YOU going to be doing?”\n“What do you mean what am I going to be doing? I’m going to be with you! Isn’t that enough?”\n“Suzy, you’re sitting here asking me to give up EVERYTHING that’s important to my life and I’m asking why should I? I mean yes, I get you don’t like Diana, but I already told you that she isn’t going to be a problem…” Bobby says before you interrupt.\n“And excuse me if I’m not completely fucking convinced. She’s your fucking ex, she hates my guts AND you expect me to live under the same roof with her even when we’re fucking married? No, not fucking happening and I’m also not being a goddamn brood sow just waiting around for you to fuck me.” You interject.\n“Don’t see how that’s much different from your life now…” Bobby says dismissively.\n\nYou’re speechless for a second.\n\n“Excuse me?” you say.\n“I said I don’t see how sitting around waiting for me to fuck you would be that big of a change in your life because you practically do that now. I mean what the hell do YOU do except hide out down here from the rest of the world and then every now and then we meet up to fuck. If we got married, the only difference would be you’d be living in a better home and actually have to do something with your time like maybe look after our kids…but of course you don’t want any because at your core you’re completely self centered and only care about what YOU want. You know, you got a lot more in common with Diana than you realize in that department.”\n\nWith as much power as you can, you slap Bobby across his face. He doesn’t flinch, and it seems he was even expecting it. He just gives you the stone face stare.\n\n“Get the fuck out. Go back to your fucked up religion and sister fucking. We’re through, for good this time.” You say.\n\nBobby doesn’t say anything he just gathers his clothing and gets dressed as fast as possible. He doesn’t look at you the entire time until he starts to walk away.\n\n“I love you Suzy, but I suppose this is easier for the both of us. I hope your life works out.” He says and then turns away.\n\nYou hear his footsteps going up the basement stairs and then eventually you hear the front door slam.\n\nAnd he’s gone. That’s it. Bobby’s out of your life forever and you immediately feel a mixture of sadness and sickness.\n\nYou’re sad of course because despite all the problems you had towards the end of your relationship (And the incredibly shitty thing he said to you which caused the final split anyway), he was your first and you do believe he did love you and you loved him.\n\nYou thought you both had so much in common at one time, but it turned out your differences were greater than you thought and some people just aren’t meant to be together.\n\nYou also feel sick due to the fact that he was potentially your “savior” in getting out of your current predicament with your older sister. Now that he’s gone, you don’t know what the hell you’re going to do. You spend a little time wondering if you should’ve just went along with Bobby’s proposal. Would it have really been all that bad?\n\nIt’s too late now though, you can’t call him now even if you really wanted to…and you do really want to, but you just can’t ignore his own faults in what caused the final straw to be broken in the relationship.\n\nSomewhere in between the crying and moping, you realize that what you’re doing right now isn’t any different from any other day; namely, you’re hiding out from the world in your basement. The only major difference is you happen to be extremely upset right now.\n\nBobby was right about that on some level. You do just sit around down here doing nothing waiting for…what exactly? Maybe you were waiting for Bobby to “save you” somehow, but obviously you didn’t really want that or at least you didn’t want it on the terms he was demanding.\n\nWhat DO you want in life Suzy? What can you do to change your status?\n\nWell, you aren’t sure what you want in life, but you know the only potential way to change your status now is to either get a job or find some new place to live. Seeing as you’re already depressed, you open up your laptop and proceed to engage in the soul-crushing task of looking for a job.\n\nAs day turns to night, you spend hours looking for a job…well actually you spend AN hour looking and the rest of the time being distracted with your depression. The problem is there is just nothing out there for the likes of you unless you want to be stripper at one of the many strip clubs. You sometimes wish you were more like Donna because if you had less hangs up about being slutty, you’d jump at the chance.\n\nHowever, you were cursed with an odd concept of self-respect so no stripping for you. You look into waitressing since it seems like that’s another job that’s always available. You find a few places hiring…at the strip clubs…great.\n\nThe further descent of desperation causes you to look for jobs involving house keeping or janitorial work. You are already dreading the idea of doing such labor, but you still have to look. You find one that’s open…at an adult bookstore. You can only imagine what you’d be primarily cleaning up.\n\n“What the fuck is wrong with this town? Isn’t there even a goddamn fast food place in need of a hapless burger flipper?” you cry out in frustration.\n\nYou’re about to give up and resign yourself to being depressed and doing nothing until you fall asleep when you find something that looks slightly more promising.\n\nThere is not one but TWO jobs open at a comic shop, imaginatively called “Jake’s Comic Shop” who you assume is the owner. One is moving a bunch of boxes around and the other is working a register. Not exactly the most desirable of jobs, but it beats the idea of dressing in skimpy clothing, getting ogled and possibly groped. (Let alone cleaning up jizz for a living)\n\nAs far as you’re concerned that’s your task for tomorrow. You’re heading over to Jake’s Comic Shop and you’re not leaving until you have employment. You feel slightly positive about this, well not really, but you do at least feel like you’ve accomplished something this dark day.\n\nWith that out of the way, you allow yourself to go back to being depressed over today’s unfortunate event until you set your alarm for tomorrow (Which you never usually do) and eventually fall asleep.\n",
  "page 187": "You already put up with one bullying asshole of an older sister who basically threw you out your house, you’ll be damned if you’ll let someone else do it again.\n\nYou turn your head to address Diana.\n\n“Hey, you know what your brother also realized? That I’m more fun in the bed than you are. Told me you were about as fun as fucking a log and about as lively too. Yeah, I’m crying alright, I’m crying tears of laughter at your fucking stupidity if you actually think you have a chance at getting Bobby back.”\n\nIf Diana were a cartoon character you’d imagine this would be the part where steam shoots out of her head and her face goes completely red.\n\n“You’re fucking dead blondie!” Diana shouts and runs at you with the knife in hand.\n\nYou grab one of the plates on the table and throw it at her. She dodges, but it’s enough to get her a bit off balance while you grab a fork and plunge it into the side of her arm.\n\n“Agh SHIT!” she shouts , but manages to swipe at you with her knife which barely misses your face. You don’t have time to retrieve your fork from her arm.\n\nYou throw another plate at her, which causes her to drop her knife when she blocks her face with her hands. She recovers quickly however and pulls the fork from her arm and lunges at you with it.\n\nAs the pair of you struggle, you and Diana have made enough noise for others to take notice of it. Helen comes walking into the room with a couple of kids behind her and freaks out.\n\n“Wha…Stop! Stop it! Don’t fight!” she exclaims and then screams for help and runs over to attempt to disarm her sister.\n\n“Please Diana, don’t…” Helen utters before Diana shoves her aside. At least this allows you to grab Diana’s wrist and slam it hard on the edge of the table, causing her to drop the fork. Doesn’t stop her from punching you with her free hand though.\n\nHelen once again tries to pull the two of you apart, but fails to do so. She ends up shouting at the cheering children who are enjoying the violent display to go fetch help.\n\nMeanwhile Diana is slightly getting the better of you in this fight as she lands a kick to your stomach, flooring you. You wheeze and have a hard time catching your breath.\n\n“You actually thought you could challenge me? What was that about me being the stupid one?” Diana taunts as she picks up a nearby chair. You barely manage to roll out of the way when she tries to bring it down on your head.\n\nDesperate to gain the advantage again, you struggle to get back up and start throwing plates at her again. She manages to deflect them with the chair, but then with all your energy you charge at her and holding on to the other end of the chair you slam her into the wall.\n\nYou manage to pull the chair away and then it’s just you and her again. At first you’re scratching, punching and slapping each other upright and then soon the pair of you are rolling on the floor.\n\n“By Tiamat’s Chaotic Cunt, quick grab ‘em both!” you hear a male voice shout.\n\nA mass of various arms and hands grab you and Diana and after a bit of prying, the would be peacemakers succeed in keeping you and Diana from doing anymore damage.\n\n“I’M NOT FUCKING SCARED OF YOU AND I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!” you scream at Diana who is being pulled away by Helen and another well dressed man you don’t recognize.\n“Whoa, easy! Easy! I gotcha.” The male voice says that spoke earlier. You look and see the one who has pulled you away from Diana and see a scruffy looking man.\n“Let go of me!” you exclaim and pull away from the man who lets you go.\n\n“Okay, okay, you’re free, now I heard you two don’t like each other, but already? What the hell happened?”\n\nAt this point you and Diana both start accusing each other of starting the fight. After some shouting you demand to know where Bobby is.\n\n“Bobby isn’t here. He actually left an hour ago to go gather some stuff from the old house. (Sigh) I wish he was here though, because this is definitely his problem not mine.” The scruffy man says.\n“Yeah, well who the fuck are you anyway?” you exclaim.\n“Wow, you’re actually a little different than I expected considering what Bobby has said about you. Though if you need to the introductions, I’m William. Mr. fancy over there is Brandon.” William remarks.\n“Hey.” Brandon says.\n\nDiana interrupts this temporary break in the hostilities by attempting to attack you again, but Brandon and Helen manage to hold her back, meanwhile William grabs you since you attempt to defend yourself.\n\n“Let me go! Why the fuck are you all holding me back?! You should be letting me kill this fucking outsider and serving her heart up to Tiamat!” Diana exclaims.\n“Yeah, while that would normally be the plan, you know damn well this is Bobby’s bride to be and he’s the head of the family. Now I know your pissed about that but them’s the rules.” William remarks.\n\n“Shut the fuck up William you don’t know shit about how I feel! And since when do you give a shit about the rules for anything?” Diana says.\n“Okay, I’ll give you both of those. However I DO respect your brother and he loves this woman so you and nobody else will be sacrificing or harming her in any way…besides given how she was fighting, I’d say she shows promise of fitting right in in this family.” William laughs.\n\nDiana shakes her head, fumes and huffs about her situation. She looks like she’s about to attack you again, but instead she pushes Helen out of the way and storms off. Despite being pushed Helen follows her sister in an effort to console her.\n\n“Well. That was exciting. If we’re all done here, I’ll be checking on Veronica and making sure the young ones aren’t getting into the armory or something. Um, nice meeting you Suzy.” Brandon remarks straightening out his suit and walks away.\n\nYou sit down on a nearby chair rubbing the upper left side of your face, which is probably sporting a bruise or soon will be. You still feel angry, but you’re too tired to go chasing after Diana at this moment. You notice William still lingering around and staring at you.\n\n“What?!” you ask.\n“Okay, just settle down now. I’m not the enemy here.” William remarks.\n“Maybe not, but I don’t really care for your staring right now.”\n“Fair enough. Like I said, you’re just much different than what I expected. Bobby mentioned to me you were this gentle quite girl. More like Helen actually. Never expected you to be giving Diana a good fight. On your second day here no less.”\n“Yeah, well everyone has their limits.”\n“Guess that’s true too, though I’m sure you know why Diana doesn’t like you.”\n“Yeah I know, and you know what? That’s tough shit and she needs to just get the fuck over it. Bobby wants to marry ME. Not her. It isn’t my fault that she’s not woman enough for him. To my understanding she had YEARS with him. If she couldn’t hang on to him with that much of a head start, I’d say the problem was with her, not me.”\n\nWilliam smiles at your remark.\n\n“Man, I wasn’t sure if I’d like you, but shit if you weren’t Bobby’s bride to be, I’D marry you. Well if I was the marrying type. Anyway, I’d say you handled the situation with Diana the only way you could have. She at least knows she can’t just bully you like she does with poor Helen. Still, I’d watch out. It isn’t over with her. She’s not going to just let this go.”\n“I’m going to tell Bobby about this and he’s going to just have to straighten her out once and for all.”\n“Well, that MIGHT work in the short term, but Diana doesn’t let go of grudges and given that you’ll officially become family soon, she’s likely to ignore him. Look, it’s like this. Diana is definitely going to try to do something to you before you can marry Bobby because if she succeeds in getting you out of the picture before that happens, she won’t suffer any repercussions. Granted Bobby will probably be pissed at her and she’ll get passed over for Helen I suppose, but as a follower of Tiamat she technically has got the right to kill an outsider. It’s just out of respect for Bobby that we accept you.”\n“Okay, so as soon as Bobby gets back, I’m going to demand he marry me now.”\n“Heh, well due to some sort of alignment of the stars on Friday I don’t think it’s going to be moved forward. Though, given how pissed Diana is about all this, I really wouldn’t put it past her to just wait years to get revenge on you and make it look like an accident or make up some sort of bullshit about it being Tiamat’s will or something.”\n“So…what…am I going to have to kill her to get any fucking peace?” you blurt out.\n\nWilliam waves his hand down a bit as if to tell you to be quiet and looks around.\n\n“Shhh, don’t talk that way out loud. You’re not officially family yet. You talk like that around some of the others here and they’ll throw you on the sacrificial altar. Hell, even Helen would probably go tell on you for talking like that.” William says.\n“What the hell? What about Bobby? Doesn’t his leadership mean anything?!”\n“Well yeah, but in case you hadn’t noticed, he’s very observant of certain rules and rituals. As much as he loves you, I don’t even he would be able to help if you actually killed Diana.”\n“Well I gotta do something! I can’t just sit around with a thumb up my ass constantly looking over my shoulder thinking Diana’s going to do something to me.”\n“I know and I get it. (Sigh) Quite frankly if I was running things, I’d go back to the old ways of Tiamat where we had less rules and ritual and more adherence to primal urges. What I’d do is have you and Diana enter a steel cage and nobody left until one of you was dead, but that’s me.”\n“Great. Glad to know I’d be better off under a more anarchic regime.” You say with a tone of defeat.\n\nWilliam exhales deeply and then speaks.\n\n“Well blondie, this is how I see it. You can either hold out until Friday after which point you can probably get rid of Diana a little easier or at least with less repercussions. Or you can, shall we say…find an opportunity before then. I’m not saying anymore, but if you really feel like you’re in immediate danger then you know what to do.”\n\nWith those words, William leaves you alone to ponder his advice.\n",
  "page 186": "TUESDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world banana eating championship! Let\u0027s all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe away the whipped cream on your lips, graciously stand up and bow for your adoring fans. The big dude on your right wearing nothing but chaps and a biker jacket looks at you in disbelief and then turns away to puke in a bucket.\n\nMeanwhile the little Asian She-Male on your left just shakes his head wondering how the hell you could\u0027ve beaten him.\n\n\"I don\u0027t understand it...all my training. I glanced over at you during the contest...you...you were barely even chewing! How?\" He asks.\n\"Oh just natural talent at swallowing bananas I suppose.\" You reply humbly and wink at the audience, which continues to praise you.\n\nWhile you\u0027re blowing kisses at your fans, you suddenly get a feeling you’ve done something like this before….\n\nSuddenly a hand touches your shoulder and you spin around to see a woman about your age with long raven colored hair and a low cut black gown. She’s pretty, but has a sneering look on her face. It’s not quite a cruel look, but she’s definitely not impressed with you.\n\n“So, you think you got what it takes to meet Misty huh? Pfft. I don’t see you lasting another day. Maybe two at best.”\n“Who is Misty?” you ask.\n“(Sigh) Deary, if you don’t know, then you’ll never know. And if you never know, then how can you ever hope to survive?” the woman says in a condescending tone and then starts laughing at you. She then begins to age rapidly until she becomes a wizened crone and then eventually a rotting corpse.\n\nWhen you begin to step back, the woman then disappears, but her laughter remains, getting louder and louder to the point being deafening and causing pain.\n\nYou futilely attempt to cover your ears, but the laughter persists even when you try to cram left over bananas in your ears.\n\nMeanwhile, the biker turns in a unicorn and the she-male turns into rainbow colored fox which jumps on the back of the unicorn and they run off together. The audience surprisingly has completely disappeared. In fact it’s just you and that awful laughter that won’t quit.\n\nJust when you think you can’t take the pain anymore everything goes black…\n\nYou wake up to the sound of a female voice.\n\n“What’s going on?!” you exclaim sitting up fast.\n“Oh! Sorry! I…I didn’t mean to wake you…but I just was told to bring you this.” the source of the female voice says.\n\nYou rub your eyes and see a young woman with light brown hair before you holding a tray of food. She’s probably a few years younger than you.\n\n“…wait…you’re Helen right?” you say recognizing her.\n“Yes. I didn’t think you remembered me. We only saw each other a couple times before.” Helen says.\n“Yeah I remember you. Where’s Bobby?”\n“Oh, Bobby’s busy doing something with cousin William. I think its something to do with working on the compound here. I’m not really sure. I just tend to look after the little ones, but Bobby told me I should bring you something to eat, so um here.”\n\nHelen thrusts the tray of food at you. It consists of typical breakfast type food like scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal and juice. You see no reason not to take the offering seeing as you aren’t served like this very often.\n\n“Wow, breakfast in bed. That’s something I’ve never had before.” You say and start to eat.\n\nHelen stares at you nervously, which causes you to stop eating.\n\n“What?” you ask.\n“Oh! Nothing, I just wanted to make sure you liked it. Is the food good? I really didn’t know what to make you and I just wanted it to be right.” Helen says.\n“It’s fine Helen.” You say.\n“Oh good. I just…I just didn’t want to disappoint you.”\n“It’s just breakfast Helen. Relax. Probably way better than anything I could make, I dunno how to cook.”\n“You don’t? Didn’t your mother teach you?” Helen asks as if cooking is something every woman knows how to do.\n“Nope. She taught me how to sew when I was younger, but I sort of stopped doing it when she died of a flesh-eating virus. Didn’t really see the point anymore.”\n“Oh no, how sad!” Helen says empathetically.\n“Yeah.” You say continuing to eat.\n“Well don’t worry, I’m a very good cook and I can even teach you!”\n“Hm, well between that offer and this meal, you’ve probably done more for me than my own family has in years.”\n“I’m so glad you said that. I want us to get along because I know you’re going to be married to Bobby and all.”\n“Wait, Bobby told you already?” you ask.\n“He told everyone last night. He was so happy. I’m so glad he was, I like seeing him happy.”\n“Hm, I can guess who wasn’t happy to hear about it.” You remark.\n“Oh. Yes. Um…you probably mean Diana. Yes, she was quite upset. Um…in fact I probably should leave. She’s looking after the little ones and I’m sure I’ll get an earful about being away from my duties for so long. She’s in a bad enough mood as it is.” Helen says.\n“Okay, well sorry to keep you then. I don’t want to get you into trouble.”\n“Oh, it’s okay. I’m not really worried about me anyway. It’s just if I stay away for too long she might… well she’s not as patient as I am with our younger siblings. So are you okay with the food and everything?”\n“Yeah Helen.”\n“Okay good. Good. Um…okay I’m going now. Um, I suppose I’ll see you around some time.”\n“Okay then.”\n\nAt this point Helen nervously waves and opens the door to leave, but then she calls out to you.\n\n“Um, Suzy?”\n“Yes?”\n“I’m really glad you’re going to be part of this family soon.” She says with a faint smile and then leaves.\n\nYou shake your head and finish your food. Helen obviously has some issues. Though maybe its because you know what its like to have a bullying older sister, you can sympathize.\n\nAfter putting aside your food tray you take a shower in the private bathroom connected to the bedroom which is very convenient. While washing up you take time to ponder your odd dream which while having its surreal moments seemed “real” to you in some ways. The raven haired woman in the dream was most certainly Bobby’s grandmother which is sort of creepy, but then maybe she just popped up due you seeing pictures of her (and even one in your room) earlier that night. Ultimately you decide not to worry too much about it unless this becomes an ongoing problem.\n\nAfter your shower, you then change your clothing and decide to explore what is now your new home.\n\nYou walk around the right wing of the compound, upstairs and down, not running into anyone. It’s all pretty empty on this side which is sort of good you suppose and you’re half tempted to just go back to your new room and play on your computer. However, you figure you’re going to have to make the effort to be social with everyone so you head over to the central part of the compound where you assume more of Bobby’s family is located.\n\nEventually you get to a large dining area and see a few dirty plates still on the table. The voices of children can be heard a few rooms away and then…\n\nThat red headed witch Diana steps out from the kitchen.\n\nShe holds a knife in one hand and you notice her hand tighten around its handle when she sees you.\n\n“Look, I don’t want any trouble Diana. I know you’re mad but…” you start to say before Diana interrupts.\n“Spare me your pathetic words blonde whore. You will not sway me with superficial attempts at diplomacy. YOU are in my way, but I promise you that before the week’s end, you will be out of it.”\n\nWhen you cautiously step back a bit, Diana smirks.\n\n“You better keep stepping backwards and out the front door if you want to stay out of my way AND keep your pitiful life.”\n\nWhile Diana is doing a fairly adequate job of intimidating you, she’s actually starting to make you angry. Like a rage is building up within you and you feel like just picking up one of the forks on one of the dirty plates on the table and stabbing her in the neck with it.\n\nIn fact violent visions start to enter your head, visions of bloody bodies and other murderous images. They hit you so suddenly; you actually stumble and keep yourself from falling by propping yourself up against the table. You then rub your head from this spell, as you don’t feel completely well.\n\n“Now what? Am I scaring you too much? Are you about to cry? By Tiamat you really are worthless. And that is why you’ll never make a good wife to my brother. You’re far too weak. My brother will realize that soon.” Diana remarks.\n\nAs unwell as you suddenly feel, the rage within you is still rising.\n",
  "page 199": "THURSDAY\n\n\n“Due to new developments, today’s contest has been canceled. We sincerely apologize to you good folks, but don’t despair with any luck our reigning champion Suzy will return to us soon to take on more challengers! Let’s still hear it for our little blonde small town girl!” the announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nWell this is certainly different, but it’s also a nice change of pace. You were starting to feel insulted by the implications of yourself participating in all these phallic food-eating contests.\n\nHowever, you’re still a little fond of being cheered for, so you stand up and take a bow for your fans.\n\nNo sooner have you done that, when your surroundings immediately change to that of a blasted wasteland. There is nothing around you save for burned out buildings in the distance and dead landscape. Reminds you a bit of a video game you once played.\n\n“You know, the entire world is soon going to look like this…how I wish I could be young and alive to experience the uncertainty and chaos that is going to shape the years to follow.” You hear a voice say.\n\nYou turn around and see Bobby’s grandmother again. She’s an old lady walking with a cane this time.\n\n“But enough about the future, let’s talk about the present. You survived a lot longer than I thought you would, maybe you are worthy of my grandson after all. You even are starting to manipulate him a bit, that’s good. The true leaders in Tiamat’s service have always been women anyway. I swear if it wasn’t for us prodding them in the right direction every now and then, most men would be content just jacking off to pass the time. Still, you aren’t quite there yet. I think today should prove to quite interesting. Survive today and you might just meet Misty yet.”\n\n“Okay, I want some answers, who the hell is Misty, and what’s going to happen today? Is Helen going to kill me?” you demand.\n“Helen? Oh yes my submissive co-dependent grand daughter. Yes, that was sort of an interesting way you dealt with her…” Grandma Morningstar replies.\n“So is she going to try to kill me or not?”\n“Who said she ever was? You just came to that conclusion yourself. She told you she was never going to try to kill you. I suppose it’s up to you to believe her or not. I think the better question is, do you like her?”\n“What?”\n“Do you like her? Not a hard question blondie.” Grandma Morningstar says tapping on her cane.\n“I don’t dislike her despite everything…I mean growing up in this family is prone to make her a little fucked up.” You say.\n“Hm, well do you think she’s pretty?”\n“Pretty?”\n“Yes, sheesh you go fucking deaf blondie? Pretty, you know better than average looks.” Grandma Morningstar replies getting annoyed.\n“Um…well I suppose she is.” You say.\n“Is one of the reasons why you spared her is because she reminds you of yourself in some ways?”\n“No…I mean…well maybe somewhat. I mean I just couldn’t bring myself to kill her on suspicion. But yes, I suppose the fact that I see some of myself in her did cause me to be a little sympathetic to her.”\n“So if you fucked her…it would almost be like fucking yourself right?”\n“Wait…what? What are you trying to get at?” you ask.\n“Oh I think you know EXACTLY what I’m trying to get at. It’s okay Suzy, I’m making no judgments. The female form is a beautiful thing. Well anyway you’ll find out what’s in store for you today soon. As for Misty, well why don’t you put some thought into it. I mean it’s pretty simple even for you blondie.” Bobby’s grandmother replies with slight distain.\n“Well can you at least tell me what’s deal with all these contests in my dreams?”\n“Sorry, I really don’t know anything about that. If you’re lucky and actually meet Misty, maybe you can ask her, but I just assumed you really liked dreaming about sucking dick...in a symbolic way I guess. Hmm, come to think of it this would explain why Bobby’s so enamored with you. Maybe you aren’t a whore blondie, but you sure got the mouth of one. It’s almost as if it was a highway for oral sex.”\n“Hey!”\n“Don’t take offense blondie. It’s a good thing. Suck a man’s dick right, and you can practically get him to do ANYTHING for you. I mean you got natural talent. Hell, maybe even Tiamat blessed you with it so you stood an equal chance against Diana. Now that girl, as much as she loves Bobby, she just can’t suck a dick properly. Bad gag reflex, slightly oversized teeth, I dunno. Tiamat works in whimsical ways I suppose.”\n“How do you even know all…nevermind I don’t want to hear anymore.” You say.\n\nBobby’s grandmother ignores you though and continues to speak.\n\n“Still, Bobby always did have a slight obsession for blowjobs. He likes them a lot more than he’s probably told you.\"\n“Gah! I’m done listening!” you shout feeling increasingly uncomfortable about hearing Bobby’s grandmother talk about his sexual interests.\n“Oh, alright Miss Prude. I’m rambling and it’s time for you to go anyway. See ya Deep Throat!” Bobby’s grandmother cackles again and then raises her cane and all your surroundings go black…\n\nAnd then you wake up.\n\n“Something bad is going to happen today.” You say to yourself.\n\n(Then again why should today be any different from the rest of this week?)\n\nYou look around and see nobody in the room (Save for Bobby’s grandmother’s portrait staring like a gargoyle). Looks like Bobby woke up before you as usual. You look at the time on your phone and see you’ve actually slept until the afternoon.\n\nWhile the normal thing for you to do would be to just stay in your room and avoid everyone, but given your recent dream, you think your best bet might be to be a little proactive today.\n\nAfter going through your usual routine of washing up and getting dressed you head down to the main living area where you know everyone usually gathers.\n\nBefore you get there you bump into Helen, who looks a bit harried and is carrying a pistol in one hand. You tense up immediately.\n\n“There you are, good. Saves me time…” she says.\n“Uh…Helen …” you start to say and back away slowly.\n“Huh?” Helen looks down at her pistol.\n“OH! Shit! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to scare you! I didn’t come to do anything to you! Here, you can take it, if it makes you feel better, but we need to go!” she exclaims and hands you the pistol.\n\nYou snatch the weapon from her and eye her suspiciously. She gets worried at first that you’re going be the one to shoot her, but then just continues to explain in greater detail about what’s going on.\n\n“Aaron came back and he’s threatening to drive an army truck through the front gate if we all don’t leave the compound. He claims that we’re defying Tiamat by not embracing the chaos outside. Bobby’s been trying to negotiate with him through the intercom, but he thinks we’re going to have no option but to open fire on Aaron.”\n“Where the hell did he get an army truck? Is William with him?”\n“Apparently the town has been in a state of martial law since yesterday and the National Guard have taken over according to Aaron’s ranting. I guess he stole one. I don’t think William is with him. Anyway Bobby wants you to be safe so follow me to where all the children...”\n\nLoud shouting by Bobby in the distance suddenly interrupts Helen. You immediately rush towards where he might be located despite the protests by the Helen that you need to come with her though she just runs along with you.\n\nYou soon manage to catch up with the most of the family (Save for the younger children and Diana) who are standing in the foyer with their weapons ready and Bobby who has opened the front door.\n\n“Aaron, I tried being reasonable. YOU left here without permission, but that was fine because it’s obvious you didn’t feel happy here. There are several paths to Tiamat’s glory and you obviously had your own ideas about which one you should pick. Anyone here is free to leave, but NOBODY is going to be forced to leave due to your threats! Again, if you try coming in here, you’re going to be shot down like a fucking dog and I’ll personally perform Tiamat’s ritual of desecration over your stinking body so your soul NEVER enters Timat’s glory!” Bobby shouts and walks out with his rifle drawn. Bobby’s brother Jordan is the first one who cautiously follows afterwards and then everyone else slowly walks towards the door as well. You don’t think anyone has even paid any attention to you or Helen (who keeps pulling on you to leave).\n\n“My soul is already with Tiamat! You can’t do shit about it ritual boy! If you unworthy fucks won’t embrace chaos as Tiamat intended, then I’m gonna bring it to you!” Aaron shouts through a bullhorn, which is followed by a laugh.\n\nThe truck revs up and Bobby orders everyone to open fire. You and Helen are still inside at this point so you don’t actually do so and just hang back as you watch Aaron mow through the gate followed by a hail of bullets peppering the oncoming truck.\n\nThe truck swerves hard to the left smashes into Brandon’s parked vehicle. You can hear him swearing about it. Meanwhile you also see Jordan jumping up and down in victory and running over to the wrecked truck.\n\n“Yeah! We got that bastard! Whoo!” he shouts.\n“Hey Jordan, get the fuck back here, don’t go off ahead like that by yourself!” Bobby shouts.\n“Aw, it’s fine, he didn’t survive that!”\n\nAnd that’s when Aaron proves Jordan wrong, starting by recovering from his crash and shooting several holes into Jordan. Then he follows up by throwing several grenades out the truck window.\n\n“SHIT!” Bobby shouts and everyone runs back, but not before several explosions occur. Nobody is killed, but everyone scrambles and on the ground crawling for cover. Bobby himself crawls behind cover of another parked vehicle and continues to fire in the direction of the truck.\n\nHelen now really tugs at you saying you need to come with her where its safe, but you wonder if you should try to help Bobby considering he’s the only one currently trying to kill Aaron. Everyone else has completely retreated and is even running past you.\n",
  "page 19": "THURSDAY\n\n\nSeveral gunshots cause you to wake up.\n\n“What the?!” you say still staying on the floor.\n“Shhhh! Quiet!” Klepto remarks and points over to the one in charge of the guardsmen. He and five others stand near the tent entrance with weapons out.\n\n“I don’t give a shit WHO started the fight or even why! You carny freaks can tear each other apart after we leave, but until then we’re here to maintain order and by god that’s what the fuck we’re going to do! If I have to break up another fight for any reason, next time the shots aren’t going in the air!” the officer remarks and leaves. The other guardsmen continue to stand near the entrance watching everyone who eventually all sit back down.\n\n“What the hell happened?” you ask.\n“Razor and some of the others got into an argument with Phil and his friends.” Klepto says.\n“Who’s Phil?” you say.\n“He does that fire eating stuff. Anyway, they kicked his ass and just as things were going to get worse, the guardsmen came in and put a stop to it like you just saw. Looks like the battle for control over the carnival is already starting.”\n“Surprised we didn’t get attacked then.”\n“Well like Shrimpy said yesterday, we’ve got dwarf protection for now, but who knows how long that arrangement is going to last.”\n“Can’t believe I slept through a fight, where’s Roofie?”\n“Oh him? He’s still over there out of it, even the gunshots didn’t wake him up.” Klepto says pointing to Roofie, who then surprises everyone.\n\n“I’m quite awake Klepto, I’m just resting with my eyes closed No point in getting up at this point anyway. It’s obvious this carnival has lost respect in me; I’d blame you all for smashing me in the back of the head last night, but that was really just a catalyst. (Sigh) Doesn’t matter, I predict that we’ll all be dead in two days at best.” Roofie says.\n\n“Roofie, we really didn’t want to do it, but you were talking crazy with your idea of attacking the military. Your plan would’ve gotten everyone killed.” You say.\n“And that may still happen if recent events are any indication. At least with my plan I would’ve died with the carnival intact rather than seeing it splitting up before my eyes.”\n\nNobody else really knows what to say at this point, so you all just get silent and continue to converse with each other.\n\n“So what’s the next move?” Klepto asks.\n“I dunno, escape I guess? Can we get to one of the vehicles quickly and drive off?” you say.\n“Good luck with that given all the guardsmen on high alert now.” Fatty points out.\n“Yeah I don’t think we’re getting very far.” Lifto adds.\n\nYou sit down and exhale wondering what to do next, but you can’t really think right now. It would seem that due to your more proactive suggestions and Roofie’s apathy you’ve somehow become the “leader” of your little group now. You hadn’t really planned on that.\n\n“For right now, we’re just going to stay put, I’ll try to think of something.” You remark. The rest of your group lack any ideas of their own, so they comply with your plan (or lack there of).\n\nTime passes and you mostly do a lot of casual conversation and mental speculation of what might happen “if you do X.” You half expect someone else to try to escape, particularly when they say they need to use the bathroom, but given that they always return under the same guard they left with it would seem nobody has the guts to really try it, not even Razor.\n\nNobody else in your group comes up with any plans either, but you do notice Shrimpy occasionally heads over to the group of dwarves. He claims he’s just securing the “alliance” but you’re more inclined to believe he’s just trying to secure his own safety. So far though the dwarves are still supposed to be on your side.\n\nRoofie has continued to lie on the sleeping mat not saying anything to anyone. You still feel a little bad about betraying him especially given that he not only brought you into this carnival and liked you enough to give you a personal trailer, but also that he potentially saved you a lot of pain when Razor was going to kick your ass.\n\nYou go over to talk to him.\n\n“Hey Roofie.” You say.\n“Hrm, hey Suzy.” He grunts.\n“Are you okay?”\n“Me? Well other than not having a drink all day, I’m fine. Just been making peace with my life I suppose.” Roofie says.\n“Roofie, I’m still very sorry about…”\n“What? Having Lifto wack me over the head? I’ve forgotten about that or rather I’ve rethought my own stance on that. You probably were right, I mean sure I would’ve rather died like that, but that was sort of selfish of me to want to use my last bit of dwindling influence to get everyone to follow me. Would’ve especially been a shame if you’d gotten killed in the crossfire. You’re actually very talented.”\n“You’re just saying that.”\n“No it’s true. I didn’t make my decision to hire you based on looks or on a whim. In the brief moment you’ve performed as a clown you were good. I mean it’s obvious you’re even a leader with how you got the other clowns hanging on your decisions. (Sigh) If only you had come across this carnival sooner. Things might’ve been much different.”\n“Well I’m not sure how much of a leader I am, because I can’t think of what comes next.” You say.\n“You’ll figure out something I’m sure. One thing though and while I don’t hold out much hope, if you can somehow keep this carnival together…do it. I know the current situation isn’t the best and I know you haven’t exactly been welcomed by everyone, but I see something in you that would feel fulfilled if you could experience the carnival like it once was. Like a family.”\n“A family?” you say with a smirk.\n“Hey like I said, you came in during the family fight. And that’s what happens in families sometimes. Family fights are always the most vicious, but after it dies down, sometimes the family unit can be stronger than ever. And I think you could be happy if you can keep this family from tearing itself apart completely. But you’ll have to be the one to do it. I don’t have it in me anymore.”\n\nAt this point Roofie touches your hand and you pat his before leaving him be again. You wonder if this is more of a last request by a “dying” man rather than looking out for your personal fulfillment. Still, you think he’s genuine and sure it would be nice if the entire carnival became the happy family you never had, but you just don’t think that’s going to be possible.\n\nYou look around and see nothing much has changed except a changing of the guards. One of them happens to be Roger, which makes you think of a possible way you could escape. The only problem is it’s going to rely on being more “charming” than you already have been with Roger and that could potentially get you into a situation you don’t want to be in.\n",
  "page 301": "“Hey Jack, is that outhouse large enough to prop up a spear inside it?”\n“Um, I think so. Why? You taking one of those instead of the bat?”\n“Yeah, I was remembering something I watched once talking about how the spear was an easy weapon to learn how to use even for someone completely unskilled which is why it was used so much in ancient and medieval wars amongst infantry. I’m just thinking I’d probably want something like that with me instead of a bat if we encounter a bear or something I want to keep at a distance.”\n\nJack looks at you a bit impressed.\n\n“Well, look at you. Suzy, warrior princess over here. You said you didn’t know anything.” Jack says smiling.\n\nYou take the spear and then look over at the shield.\n\n“Jack, help me get that shield down from the wall.” You say.\n“What?” Jack responds.\n“I want to take the shield with me too.”\n“Suzy, you’re just going to the bathroom, not to war!”\n“Hey you said it yourself, we still don’t know what this place is all about and I want to feel as secure as possible, so if that means carrying around a shield, then that’s what I’m going to do!”\n“…alright…” Jack says and then proceeds to grab the circular shield down from the wall and then hands it to you.\n\nThe shield isn’t light and is made of strong thick wood; you definitely feel the weight just holding the thing.\n\n“You sure you don’t want the sword too?” Jack asks.\n“Nah, I think this is all I can carry. The shield is definitely heavier than I thought it would be.”\n“I really don’t think you’re going to need that.” Jack says wrapping a fur around himself and grabbing the axe he brought with him from the Gray Building.\n“And like I said, it makes me feel better. Come on let’s go.”\n\nUpon exiting the cabin you see the sun shining down and you feel the cold wind blow.\n\n“Shit, even with these furs on I forgot how cold it was.” You say.\n“We’ll get another big fire started when we get back.” Jack says.\n“I’ll look forward to it, so which way?”\n“Oh to the left and then past some trees, it’s not hard to find.”\n\nYou and Jack make your way to the infamous outhouse. You both look around periodically, but see nothing dangerous. When Jack’s not looking around, he’s studying you.\n\n“So you ready to fight the Persians?” Jack asks with a smirk.\n“I dunno, but I have to say I do feel rather empowered.” You reply.\n\nEventually you get to your goal and it looks exactly like you thought it would.\n\n“Well this is it.” You say unenthusiastically.\n“Your shield is going to be kind of bulky, leave it out here with me. Unless you plan on getting attacked from below and if that’s the case, a shield isn’t going to help.”\n“Fuck, now I’m going to be worrying about something lurking down there and reaching up to grab me. Thanks a lot!” you say and give the shield to Jack.\n\nYou enter the outhouse and endure the unavoidable. Thankfully Jack makes no attempt to speak or make jokes to you while you’re inside.\n\nEventually you come out and start putting your hands in the snow. Jack watches you and then goes back to looking around.\n\n“Well, wasn’t as bad as I thought, I’m still missing modern plumbing though. Wish we had soap too.” You say.\n“I guess if you want to sanitize your hands even more I suppose you could pour some of that mead we have at the cabin on them.”\n“Will that work?”\n“It’s got alcohol in it, I assume it can’t hurt. You ready to go Valkyrie?” Jack asks and hands you back your shield.\n“Yeah, you see anything out here?”\n“Nah, just a few more of those white rabbits I always see hopping around.”\n\nAs you and Jack make your way back to the cabin, you and he speak on if either one of you knows anything about hunting. You of course know nothing, Jack says he’s not much better, though he thinks maybe you both could start making simple traps or something, especially given that there are obviously rabbits around here to be caught.\n\n“Wish we had the Internet so we could at least look all this shit up. God, I really miss the Internet…I think this is the longest I’ve been without it and I suppose those days are over as well.” You say as you approach the cabin.\n“Oh, you don’t know. We’re still just stuck out here in the wilderness, like I said, maybe there is Internet and hover cars somewhere else.”\n“Love that optimism Jack…” you say chuckling and heading towards the door.\n“Hey Suzy, wait is that blood in the snow?”\n\nYou and Jack both stop a few feet away from the cabin, you’re still closest to the door, which suddenly swings open, instinctively you put the shield up to cover yourself as much as you can.\n\nBefore you, you see a man with a good amount of facial hair and wearing several furs and clothing much more suited for this sort of weather.\n\nHe’s not completely standing upright, but is in a somewhat stooped position as if wounded which judging from the blood in the snow is probably the case. While it’s difficult to tell his facial expression due to the hair, his eyes are wide as if he’s surprised, desperate or possibly even afraid. Maybe a mixture of all three.\n\nThe major thing you see however is the crossbow he’s holding and pointing at you and Jack.\n\nThe man shouts something at you in a language you don’t understand and fires, but fortunately you had the shield in front of you and the bolt is prevented from hitting your body and merely goes stops half way through the shield instead.\n\nThere is the smallest pause in this encounter where you realize that you just came close to being killed again, Jack realizing you nearly came close to being killed and the man realizing he’s failed to kill you.\n\nThe man quickly backs inside and hastily attempts to reload his crossbow, meanwhile you don’t think about your near death experience and just act. You charge forward with the shield up and the spear out. You even start screaming like you’re in an action movie.\n\nYour charge is stopped when you hit the man full on. The spear sinks into his body and he cries out in pain dropping the crossbow. You attempt to pull the spear as hard as you can back out, but it isn’t easy because the man keeps you from doing so by gripping the top of the shaft and the man still has enough strength to grab the knife on his side with his other hand.\n\nFortunately he can’t quite reach you and swings helplessly with one hand. Since you can’t pull the spear out, you instead start wiggling it to the left and right no doubt adding to the pain as well as internal organ damage. The man once again screams in agony and lets go of the spear allowing you to pull it out. He falls to the floor.\n\nJack who was having difficulty in getting around you before finally succeeds so he can get in closer to swing his axe down at the man on the floor.\n\n“Suzy, hang on I can…agh!” Jack exclaims as the man desperately slashes at the closest leg to him with his knife, which happened to be Jack’s. This causes Jack to reel back and nearly stumble into the fireplace. Fortunately he only falls into a small pile of logs for the fireplace.\n\nYou press your advantage by stepping up and attempting to plunge the spear into the man’s neck, but he manages to dodge and you only hit the floor. He grabs the shaft of the spear again in an attempt to keep you from using it. He’s got a weak one-handed grasp though.\n",
  "page 300": "You’ve never used a spear before, so you aren’t even sure if you’d use something like that effectively. Better to stick with something you’re used to.\n\nJack puts on one of the furs as well and grabs his axe and the pair of you are out the door. The sun shines down and you feel the cold wind blow.\n\n“Shit, even with these furs on I forgot how cold it was.” You say.\n“We’ll get another big fire started when we get back.” Jack says.\n“I’ll look forward to it, so which way?”\n“Oh to the left and then past some trees, it’s not hard to find.”\n\nYou and Jack make your way to the infamous outhouse. You both look around periodically, but see nothing dangerous.\n\nEventually you get to your goal and it looks exactly like you thought it would.\n\n“Well this is it.” You say.\n“I’ll be out here. Keeping a look out.” Jack responds.\n\nYou enter the outhouse and endure the unavoidable. Thankfully Jack makes no attempt to speak to you while you’re inside.\n\nEventually you come out and start putting your hands in the snow.

You feel the piecing object go into your heart and you fall to the ground.\n\nJack screams your name and attacks the man who is desperately attempting to reload his crossbow.\n\nYou however never know if Jack avenges your death.\n",
  "page 303": "With as much strength as you can, you pull the spear from the man’s grasp. It puts you a little off balance, which is enough for the man with his other hand to swing his with the knife and plunge it into your foot before pulling it out again.\n\nYou scream in pain and lose complete balance and fall to the floor dropping your spear.\n\nJack has recovered by this point to help, but the man sits up and throws his knife into Jack’s stomach. Jack falls to the floor, dropping his axe and stopped from being able to help you.\n\nMeanwhile you’re attempting to recover from your wounded foot, and sit up just in time to see the man stagger and stumble over to pick up the spear. Upon seeing how severely wounded Jack is, and your own injury you begin to panic. Not enough to run, but also not enough to make the best decisions.\n\nYou limp over to the man in an attempt to cave his head in with the shield, but thanks to your foot, you aren’t really the fastest. The man dodges your attempt by falling back to the floor, but with the spear now in his hand, from his prone position he manages to thrust it into your side.\n\nYou cry out and fall. The agony of your wounds is overwhelming now and you can barely stand it. Actually you can’t stand it at all and your body feels like it’s going into shock, like all the energy is leaving you.\n\nYou weakly attempt to put your shield up to defend yourself when you see the man hover above you, but you don’t have the strength just tears. He knocks the shield aside and finishes you off by spearing your throat.\n",
  "page 304": "Thinking unconventionally and with a bit of a heft from your shield arm, you drop your shield on the man’s body. He isn’t expecting the sudden weight smashed into him and expects it even less when you decide to jump on top of the shield, putting more crushing weight on his wounded torso.\n\nThe man bellows and lets go of your spear. He doesn’t even have the energy to do anything with his other hand holding the knife.\n\nYou quickly lift the spear from its original position and looking directly into his eyes, you thrust it directly into his throat and twist.\n\nThe man makes sickening gurgling sounds as blood comes from his mouth and neck, his eyes bulge and his body convulses for a few seconds and then stops.\n\nMeanwhile, you’re breathing heavily and just staring at the body.\n\n“Suzy? Suzy? You alright?” Jack asks.\n“Huh? Yeah…I just…I just killed a man. Never did that before…well not directly I suppose.” You say and step down from the shield and the dead man’s body.\n\nJack limps over to close the door and then over to you.\n\n“You…you sure you’ve never fought before? I mean it all happened so fast, but you seemed to just suddenly go into some sort of warrior mode.”\n“I dunno. Something just clicked inside my head. Can’t explain it myself either. Maybe it was just a fight or flight response and I’ve been sick of running lately. This guy was trying to kill us and I had no choice but to kill him.”\n“Well it was certainly one of those situations.”\n“Yeah…I guess. Is your leg okay?” you say moving your shield off the body.\n“Yeah, It’s superficial, I guess I better clean it out with alcohol and wrap it up though. I think I saw a roll of linen wrap in one of those drawers.”\n“Looks like that’s what this guy was attempting to do too because the wrap you mentioned is right there on the table along with an open jar and a big pouch. This guy was obviously already hurt when we found him. Look there.” You say and point at the man who you now notice has an ugly gash on his arm that looks like some green stuff was smeared on it. You lift up a few more of the furs on his body and notice another wound on his side as well. You weren’t responsible for either of those.\n\nJack goes over to get the wrap and inspect the open jar.\n\n“I think this might be some sort of ointment. Smells awful and has the same green color on his wounded arm. This pouch looks like it has more of his items. I’m going to take a look.” Jack says.\n\nWhile Jack goes through the dead man’s bag, you decide to directly search the body. You don’t find anything though except a half full quiver of crossbow bolts and his fur clothing, which you start taking off of him.\n\n“Suzy, what are you doing?” Jack asks when he sees you stripping the dead man.\n“I’m looting his corpse. So far this is the only set of proper clothing we have for this sort of weather. Might as well keep some of it, we can always get the blood out and I can sew up the holes later. The boots alone should be worth keeping.” You say.\n“…well I suppose you’re right. You need any help?” Jack asks.\n“Nah, I got it. Just patch up your leg.” You say.\n\nWhile Jack does just that, you proceed with your task. By the time you get the man down to his raggedy loincloth, you temporarily stop to just look at the body, exhale and rub your hand over your face.\n\n“Not a pretty sight from here either.” Jack says.\n“No, it’s not that. It’s the fact that I’ve just realized that I’ve been sitting here stealing a dead man’s clothes and I don’t feel bad about it. And even coming to that conclusion, I STILL don’t feel bad about it. It’s like nothing.”\n“Well I admit, this is sort of fucked up, but he did attack us first.”\n“The thing is though is we’re the trespassers. I mean he owned this place. Probably built it with his own fucking hands. From his perspective and any right thinking person’s, he had the damn right to try to kill us. I know if someone invaded my home I wouldn’t like it. We just stumbled in and started going through his shit and stealing it.” You say.\n“We needed to survive.” Jack says.\n“I’m not debating that. I just…well…does this make us evil? Because if it does, I have to say, I’m perfectly fine with that and that’s probably a scariest thing I’ve just learned about myself this week and the funniest too, because I can also honestly say killing this guy was one of the highest points of motivation I’ve ever had and that includes all the times I was running for my life this week and especially attempting to get a job in a shitty comic shop.” you say.\n\nJack doesn’t respond, he just sort of looks down and then away, going back to wrapping his leg.\n\nYou stand up and grab the man by his feet.\n\n“Jack can you get the door?” you say.\n“Yeah, and don’t try to drag him by yourself, I’ll help.” Jack replies as he heads over to the door.\n“It’s okay. I got it. Just get that fire going while I’m dragging his body out into the wilderness.” You say.\n“Suzy, we’re in this together. I’ll help you.” Jack says.\n“Yeah, you’re right. Grab the other leg after you open the door.” You respond.\n\nYou and Jack drag the body into the wilderness. You make a mention that maybe you should bury it at some point, but as long as it’s immediately out of sight and away from the cabin, it’s good enough where it is.\n\nThe pair of you then quickly make your way back hoping nobody else has shown up at your home. Which is certainly what it is now considering you just killed the owner. You’re still feeling a bit numb about that.\n\nWhen you’re back inside the cabin, Jack speaks up again.\n\n“Just for the record, I don’t think we’re evil.” Jack says.\n“Well evil people don’t tend to think they are.” You answer with a minor chuckle.\n“I dunno about that, there are tons of evil bastards that revel in their evilness. I mean I’ll admit I feel a little bad about what we did, but I just don’t want you to beat yourself up about what happened too much. It’s done.”\n“I’m not. That’s sort of my point and why I was wondering if I was evil in the first place, but you’re right. It wasn’t something to brag about, but it’s done and there’s no point in worrying about it.”\n\nYou close the door and bar it.\n\n“I’m a little tired. I’m going to go lay down on the bed.” You say.\n“Okay, I’ll get this fire going like I planned to do before all this happened. I’ll clean up some of the mess around here too.” Jack replies.\n\nYou get on the simple bed, which is basically made up of straw, animal skin and furs. It’s not a sofa, but it’s all the comfort you’re going to have in the near future.\n\nEven though you already talked about this with Jack, you still can’t help but go back to it. You start wondering if there is something genetically wrong inside your head and part of you takes after your uncle Ed, or maybe if when you went through all that shit in the Gray Building you “lost” part of yourself somehow.\n\nThen you start wondering if maybe it was just a desperate situation and in such times, people do desperate things even if they normally wouldn’t have done so. Like Jack said, you are trying to survive and like you said, that man was going to kill you and you had to prevent that from happening.\n\nIt’s as good as a rationalization as any. Jack seems to be fine with it and you are too.\n\nYou sit up slightly from your position and watch Jack clean up the place and stoke the fire. It’s weird to think you met this guy in a comic shop and here you are with him who knows where.\n\nYou’ve had more adventures with him this week than you ever had with anyone else. And that includes Bobby because it wasn’t like the two of you ever went anywhere.\n\nAs you think on these things, your hands start to wander and you feel a lump in your pocket which you forgot being there. You half expect it to be your dead cell phone, but what it is, is the thousand dollars and the car keys Jack gave you.\n\n“Heh, I forgot these were even in my pocket. Guess we have another reminder of the old world.” You say jingling the keys a bit at Jack.\n“Sadly, I doubt if all that cash is going to be useful here, well except for kindling.” Jack replies\n“Well at least the keys can be a reminder of your first gift ever to me.” You respond.\n“Great. My first gift to you was a car and a thousand dollars. That’s going to be tough to top now.” Jack says.\n“Actually I got an idea of how you might be able to match it. Jack, stop cleaning up, I want you over here.” You say.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing’s wrong. I’m just remembering earlier that we were in middle of something, and I’m thinking we need to get back to that again.”\n“Wha…oh…” Jack says suddenly getting it when you start taking your clothes off.\n“Well, what are you waiting for? Get your clothes off.” You say.\n“Suzy, we don’t need to do this you know. I’m perfectly fine waiting.” Jack says.\n“Yeah, well I’m not. It’s been a while and I haven’t even been able to set time aside for splittin’ the kitten so this is as much for me as it is for you. Besides, after surviving the week we’ve both had, I think we should have a little celebration don’t you think? What the fuck else do we have to do?” you say.\n\nJack doesn’t respond, he just starts taking his clothes off a bit shyly. It’s at that moment you remember the fact that he seemed a little inexperienced when you were kissing him earlier.\n\n“Jack, you don’t need to be nervous around me. We can start off slow if we need to and I’m not going to judge. It’s just me and you okay? Just like it’s been all this week.”\n“Okay. I just…I’m…I’m a…”\n“I know and it’s fine, just come over to me.” You say reassuringly.\n\nIt isn’t long before Jack and you are both on the bed naked. Just as you said, you take it a bit slow with him. Feels a little weird being the “aggressive” one, but there certainly is a part of you that’s enjoying the role.\n\nYou’re in the middle of it, when Jack says something that makes things slightly odd.\n\n“I love you Suzy.” He says.\n“… I… love you Jack…” you answer back.\n\nWell, maybe it isn’t TOO odd, considering you’re probably the only girl Jack has ever been with and spent any long amount of time with too.\n\nIn fact you sort of wonder why you even hesitated to say it back, after all, you are fond of him and you’ve had a budding relationship with Jack all this week. You just suppose that “love” hasn’t really been in your mind since you broke up with Bobby.\n\nStill, it’s a nice feeling after all the shit that’s happened this week.\n\nAfterwards, you and Jack hold each other and generally talk about shit that doesn’t pertain to your immediate situation. There is much that will have to be done, but for now the pair of you are enjoying shutting out the outside world.\n\nJust like when you two were living in the basement.\n\nDay eventually becomes night and the pair of you turn in a little earlier than usual.\n",
  "page 307": "Eternal Mother\n\n\nThe Future…\n\nIt’s a harsh world.\n\n“Number 660.”\n\nPossibly more than your old one was, but you eventually learned how to deal with it. You even managed to make a proper life for yourself here despite all the trials and tribulations.\n\nYou remember how hard that first year with Jack was. Struggling to survive, learning how to hunt, dealing with the elements, dealing with unfriendly people and creatures, and generally just being a “modern” person who didn’t have too many survival skills to speak of and being thrust into a primitive environment.\n\nYou think learning the language was the most difficult part. Jack was always a little better at it than you were. You probably still sound like a retard to some folks, but it gets the job done.\n\n“Number 661.”\n\nDuring those early years you also ended up having to do a few things you never took pleasure in doing, but it was always it was always for survival.\n\nIn those instances you were always a little better at that. Jack would definitely always support you, but then he loved you very much and would have followed you into the Gates of Hell.\n\nYou suppose it did get to a point where rationalizations really didn’t excuse what you did, but then you don’t think you ever cared about those anyway. You were a woman who was willingly dating a human sacrificing cultist at one time after all.\n\nYou smile upon thinking about your old flame. You think Bobby would have fit in very well in this world.\n\nMaybe to some extent, you did too.\n\n“Number 662.”\n\nYou think for a while you might have gotten a little colder and ruthless. Seemed like this was a place where the strong ruled over the weak and fuck you if you couldn’t keep up. From what you could tell people here had three choices:\n\nBeg and hope their tormenters took mercy on them, which was almost never likely.\n\nDie and just roll over to accept death because it was preferable to keep living in this shitty world.\n\nOr struggle and fight tooth and nail for what little you actually did have. And in that case you either won or kept it, or you died and lost it.\n\nYou know which one you chose.\n\n“Number 663.”\n\nThings did change a little though when you had your first child. You never planned on ever having a family before, let alone one in a world like this one since it seemed more like a punishment than a blessing…but Jack always had a way of making you see the positive.\n\nYou loved him for that.\n\nAnother child followed and for a while it seemed like everything was going well. You had a loving family, a larger dwelling; you weren’t struggling to survive any more. You even had another baby on the way and you didn’t even mind it.\n\nHell, you probably achieved quite a bit for a pair of former basement dwellers.\n\nYou were starting almost feel “normal” or as normal as you could ever be or get in a place like this.\n\nAnd then just like everything in your life, it all eventually went to shit.\n\n“Number 664.”\n\nWhile the occasional wandering ogres were certainly dangerous, they tended to stick a little further north. Other than that dead ogre you saw the first time you came here, you fortunately never encountered one in person again. The freedom fighting elves gave grief to the government, but never really made raids on civilian settlements. Indeed they tended to stay hidden.\n\nThe barbarian tribes however were always an ongoing problem in Rask, but you always figured you were far enough away from them and you knew there was at least an Empire Fort in the area they would attack first before moving deeper into more “civilized” territory.\n\nOf course the Empire has always had a hard time maintaining order in this place. You suppose that was one of the upsides of living here, you didn’t need to deal with the oppressive seemingly monolithic government that controls a vast amount of land here.\n\nBut it was also a downside as you would soon experience one dreadful day and the fact it all happened in broad daylight does make it seem all the more horrible.\n\nA small group of seven barbarians from the Wendigo tribe suddenly attacked, possibly the most vicious of all the tribes in fact. They attacked without warning and so fast, that your two children were dead before you or Jack could even spur into action.\n\nWhile you and Jack had long been experienced in combat during your time here, you and he were no match for them or their numbers. Especially in your condition at the time.\n\nYou sometimes wonder if a baby hadn’t burdened you, you would have been able to at least save Jack.\n\n“Number 665.”\n\nBefore he tried to hold them off to give you time to run, you remember Jack’s last words to you;\n\nGo. Our child needs to survive. YOU need to survive.\n\nYou almost didn’t want to. You almost wanted to meet death right there with him, but you think two things stopped you.\n\nOne, your will to survive has always been stronger than your defeatism.\n\nAnd two, you loved Jack enough to honor his last request.\n\nYou remember when you managed to get far enough away to the safety of a town; you broke down in tears and cried over him for at least a couple days. You still do sometimes. You miss him so much.\n\nYour eyes tear up a bit upon thinking about Jack and then you hear your number being called out. It’s time to do this.\n\nMaybe you could look after this child, but it would be a struggle. A struggle you just can’t do. Part of you feels like you’re going back to your “old ways” by taking the easy way out, but you haven’t come to this conclusion lightly.\n\nYou stand up and make your way to the front of the long waiting room. A tired looking clerk behind a counter looks at you and the bundle you’re carrying.\n\n“Name?” she asks.\n“Suzy McCray.” You answer.\n“And I take it that this is the baby you wish to put into the care of the Empire?”\n“…Yes…”\n“Very well. Sign this, and you’ll receive your payment.”\n“I don’t want payment.” You say which causes a very confused look on the clerk’s face.\n“Don’t want payment? Well that’s a first. We got some people here all the time bringing in babies. Probably stealing them in fact, but at least it’s better than those dark elves do.”\n“Well I don’t want payment.”\n“Well I’m sorry, but that’s sort of a law. You have to take something.”\n“Can’t you just make sure that he’ll be given a good home?”\n“I can’t make that promise, I don’t even do that process! I’m just a damn underpaid government drone. If you’re so damn concerned about him, why the hell are you giving him away?”\n\nJust as you’re about to yell at the clerk, another woman walks over. She has long white hair and very dark skin. She’s very pretty. You wonder if this one of those svelk you’ve heard about.\n\n“Frieda, what’s got you all flustered and generally acting like a typical monkey as usual?” she asks.\n“Huh? What the hell are you doing here? You slumming or something? Shouldn’t you living the good life in the Emperor’s Palace like my high and mighty brother?”\n“Jealousy is a terrible thing Frieda especially when I’ve spoken to Jacob on more occasions than I’d care to and I can honestly say you have nothing to be jealous about… but then neither would he. However, for your information I’m here on official business.”\n“Hrm. Well good for you, now let me get back to my fucking job.”\n\nAt this point you intervene.\n\n“Look can we please get back to me?”\n\nJust as the clerk is about to say something. The svelk woman speaks out again.\n\n“Frieda. You’re obviously burned out, why don’t you let me take over for awhile?”\n“You? Working a lowly job like this?”\n“Sure, I’m no stranger in performing tasks nobody likes to do.”\n“Fine by me. I’m going on a LONG break.” She says and storms off leaving you and the svelk woman to talk.\n\nShe smiles at you in an attempt to be friendly, but right now you just want this to be over with and you’re starting to think this was a bad idea.\n\n“Don’t pay any attention to her, I’m sure you have a very good reason for giving your child to the care of the Empire.” The svelk says.\n“I don’t want to, you know.” You say.\n“I believe you. I don’t think any mother truly ever wants to give up their child, but if I may ask, why are you doing it?”\n“It’s just…(sniffle) I lost my husband and other children in a Wendigo raid and I barely have anything left. (sniffle) I can’t take care of him the way I want to. I mean maybe I could try, but I just don’t have the energy left in me to do it. I don’t have the drive and if I do a half assed job of it and something happens to him because I can’t do my fucking job, then I’m even shittier mother than I thought. I can’t take another loss in my life.” You say trying to keep it together.\n\nThe svelk woman nods.\n\n“I see. I think I understand. So what is it that you were exactly arguing about before? I heard something about not wanting payment.”\n“I don’t, I’m not selling my baby for financial gain, I’ll be fine. I’m giving him to the Empire because I’m hoping there is an off chance that the fucking government will do a better job at raising him or finding someone to raise him than I can because I’m too emotionally drained to do it any more.” You say.\n“Well, I hate to destroy your hope, but many of the children put in the care of the Empire aren’t exactly that much better off. In fact in some cases they might be worse and as for getting someone to adopt, well it’s a possibility a good family will, but usually they’re just passed off to anyone.”\n“Great. So this has all been a waste of fucking time. Nice to know the Empire is fucking incompetent as well as being oppressive.”\n\nTo your surprise the svelk woman laughs a little.\n\n“You speak your mind. I like that. Hmm. Well, tell you what I CAN put him in the special E Wing.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Oh just a place where they often put unwanted babies from higher born families. Bastard children spawned by lust that would create social embarrassments, that sort of thing. Typically these children are very well looked after and special care is gone to make sure they aren’t going to sweat shop owners or something equally hideous.”\n“And he would get a good home?”\n“Well maybe, I should inform you though that it’s still rare and if not adopted within a certain period of time the Empire still raises them directly. These children are typically raised to be officers and commanders in the military. Their training is severe, but the results create very well disciplined and skilled men and women…are you okay with your child possibly being given that sort of life?”\n\nYou look down at your baby. He’s been very quiet throughout all this. Hasn’t cried once. Never been much of a crier really. It’s odd. You begin to think about how harsh this world is, and maybe it would be best if your baby got that sort of life. At least he would be better able to survive this world. Much better odds than you can provide.\n\nYou begin to sniffle and cry. You nod.\n\n“Okay (sob) okay. Do it. It’s a better life than I can ever give him now. (sob)”\n“Very well. Let me have him.”\n\nYou reluctantly pass your baby to the svelk woman who smiles as she holds him.\n\n“I’m usually not fond of the way human babies look, but I have to admit, this one is sort of cute. What’s his name?”\n“Name? Oh…yes. Well his name was the same as his father’s middle name.” you say and tell her your baby’s name.\n“Hrm. Strange name, but then I’ve always found human names a bit weird.”\n“Do I need to sign anything?”\n“Nah, I’ll take care of this myself and have two of the best workers here take him to the appointed location. Contrary to the horrible lies about my people, we svelk cherish the lives of infants. You don’t worry about this little one any longer, he’s truly in good hands now and will either get a good home or receive the very best training the Empire can provide. You have my word and I say that as one of the Emperor’s top advisors.”\n\n“Goodbye.” You say, tearfully waving at your baby one last time. The svelk woman holds your baby’s hand up and makes a waving motion with it. You can’t stay any longer and you leave the building as fast as you can.\n\nThe streets of the capital are busy, but you still manage to find a secluded spot to release your anguish. You still don’t know if you made the right decision, but it’s done and now all you can do is hope.\n\nEventually in time you manage to get over your loss and move on with your life. You’ve suffered much tragedy, but above all you’ve always been a survivor and you’ll survive this too. Jack was right about that.\n\nYears pass as years always do and eventually you grow old. Much of the political climate changes within your lifetime, but as a fairly mundane citizen who never makes waves and knows how to keep out of the way during times of strife you’re never ever in the middle of it.\n\nYou spend your remaining years living day-to-day and occasionally brightening up you life by dwelling on happier times.\n\nWhen you finally die, it’s not an important death, as you were never considered an important person. However you and your decisions probably made more of an impact on this world than anyone would ever really know.\n\nFor it was your little Francis that grew up and became…\n\nETERNAL\n",
  "page 10": "Lifto might mean well, but you’d rather stick with your original plan.\n\n“No, I’m not going to feel safe in my trailer until we leave the damn area, so I still want to sleep in your trailer.”\n“Well, okay but I’m telling you it’s going to be crowded and like I said that floor isn’t something you want to sleep on.” Klepto says.\n\nYou assure the rest that you’ll be fine and head back with them to the trailer and that’s when you truly begin to appreciate Klepto’s warnings. The floor of their trailer is filthier than Ranko’s. A lot of food leavings, wrappers and some dirty clothing. You imagine that Fatty is probably the biggest contributor to the trash.\n\nOddly the smell isn’t that bad, but you’re not sure about sleeping on the floor anymore.\n\n“Uh, I see what you mean. I think you’re right. If I slept on the floor, I’d wake up stuck to it.” You say.\n“I told you, so what did you want to do?” Klepto asks.\n“My offer still stands Suzy and I swear I’m not going to try anything. The alleviation of your worries is my foremost concern.” Lifto remarks.\n“And that’s sweet, but I’m still sleeping here and not on the floor. I’m taking one of those beds.”\n\nAt this point the rest of the clowns are a little surprised by your demand.\n\n“Uh look Suzy, I know you’re concerned about sleeping in your trailer tonight even if I think there isn’t anything to worry about and I know we’ve all gotten a little closer and we all like each other, but come on you don’t seriously think one of us is going to give up our bed for a disgusting floor!” Klepto remarks.\n“You don’t have to I’m taking Shrimpy’s bed.”\n“I’m not sleeping on the floor either!” Shrimpy remarks.\n“You don’t have to, I’ll share it with you.”\n“WAIT WHAT?!” all of them say.\n\n“Look, it’s like this. I’m not going to take up that much room in your beds, which means Fatty and Lifto’s beds are out since they themselves can barely fit in them. That leaves Klepto and Shrimpy. Personally I want as much room as I can get and with no offense to Shrimpy due to his size, he’s got more room to spare.”\n\nShrimpy smugly smiles at the others.\n\n“Makes sense to me! Okay let’s get to bed everyone!” Shrimpy says excitedly.\n“Hey wait a minute! We didn’t agree to this!” Klepto remarks.\n“Yeah, it seems like you were worried about me trying something yet you’re going to sleep in Shrimpy’s bed? You might be waking up sticky anyway with that little perv next to you.” Lifto says.\n“Oh no I won’t because Shrimpy is going to not only sleep with his back towards me, we’re also going to sleep head to toe…well toe to waist anyway. And if I so much feel any sort of unwanted grope, fondle or bad touch during the night there will be severe consequences to his man parts. I might be a little nervous about sleeping by myself tonight, but I’m not nervous about punching a dwarf in the balls because he’s perving on me. Understood?”\n“I get it.” Shrimpy remarks, but he doesn’t seem any less disappointed in this arrangement though.\n“And if anyone doesn’t like it, well my trailer is currently empty for anyone. Lots of room to get a good night’s sleep.” You add.\n\nNobody takes you up on your trailer offer or says anything else though you hear some grumbling from Fatty who says he just wants to get off his feet and sleep and on that note you all head for dreamland.\n\nYou get in Shrimpy’s bed first and get into a comfortable position, and then Shrimpy does likewise at the opposite end of the bed.\n\nYou’re semi-awake for a while wondering if Shrimpy is going to ignore your warning, but he’s asleep pretty fast. Honestly its Fatty’s snoring that’s more bothersome. You guess the others are used to it.\n\nAs you start to get sleepy you can’t believe you’re not only sharing a bed with a midget clown, but that you’re going to leave everything behind tomorrow. The funny thing is you’re getting a lot more comfortable with that idea now. You think this is the longest you’ve gone without constant Internet or TV stimulation and you don’t mind at all.\n\nEventually you do fall asleep feeling almost as safe as you did in your basement.\n",
  "page 306": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou groggily wake up and see Jack over at the table like he was the last time you woke up in this place. He looks like he’s studying a piece of paper and doesn’t notice you waken immediately this time.\n\nAfter sitting up, you call out to him.\n\n“Hey, cunninglinguist whatcha discover today?” you ask rubbing your eyes.\n“Oh hey, you’re up. Just looking at this parchment that was in this large pouch here. It’s a crude map from what I can tell.”\n“A map? Well that’s convenient. Anything good?”\n“Well I don’t know all the symbols obviously, but I THINK this might lead to a couple towns. Some of these look like roads, I don’t know though until we do some exploring.”\n“Let’s do it.” You exclaim.\n“What right now?”\n“Sure. I mean we’re going to have to at some point, might well start getting some of this shit out of the way.”\n“Well okay, guess we better get dressed then.”\n\nYou nod and start grabbing your clothing. As much is you might like the furry boots, They’re a little big on you. They’re actually a little big on Jack too, but they at least fit him better, so he gets them. You both of you put on furs much like you did yesterday, then you grab your spear and shield.\n\n“I think I’ll take that other spear. Seems like it worked for you yesterday.” Jack mentions.\n“You sure you don’t want to take the crossbow?” you ask.\n“If I knew how to use one properly, sure I’d take it. But I think I’m going to have to practice with something like that first. Seems slow to load and it won’t do you any good if you’re in trouble and I can’t use it effectively. At least with this spear I can help you directly.”\n“Yeah, good idea.”\n\nAfter hiding a few of your more valuable items (Like your only pouch of coins) you both leave the cabin.\n\n“So which way should we go?” you ask.\n“Hmm, I’m thinking we should follow the tracks of the guy who lived here. They were going to the right before he came back. According to the map, there is a town in this direction. Or at least I think there is, guess we’ll find out.”\n“Okay.”\n\nYou and Jack head to the right. The occasional blood in the snow makes it pretty easy to follow them though the tracks have been partially covered by snow or stomped over already.\n\n“I’m thinking it was sort of a good thing that guy was wounded yesterday. He wasn’t exactly easy to put down. I can’t imagine the fight he would have put up if he had been at full strength.” Jack says.\n“Yeah, but now I’m wondering what the hell he was fighting before he met us and how many.” You respond.\n\nEventually after a bit of traveling, you and Jack see something lying in the snow. It looks very large too. The pair of you cautiously approach.\n\nWhen you reach the body, you notice that it’s a massive… creature with grayish blue skin and tusk like teeth. It’s dressed in the barest of fur clothing and has several crossbow bolts and arrows in its body and face. You also see signs of deep cuts across its body. Next to its body is a large club, which resembles more of a broken tree branch rather than a proper weapon. However it would certainly kill someone if swung at them and judging by how massive this creature’s muscles are, it looks more than capable of smashing someone’s head in even without a club. The club has signs of blood on it.\n\n“Holy shit. What the fuck…” Jack says.\n“I think we just found what that guy was running from or limping away from rather. Must’ve been quite the fight.” You say.\n“I think there is more stuff up ahead, well more blood anyway.”\n\nYou and Jack leave the creature’s body behind and follow the rest of the blood trail noting a broken sword along the way.\n\nYou soon find a second body, but this one looks human, or at least you guess it was, since the half of the head is caved in. Blood and brains are scattered about the snow. It’s a pretty grisly sight, but you’re long since desensitized by now.\n\nYou see a bow nearby, but the body still clutches a bloody dagger in its hand. A fur hat also sits several paces away. You assume it probably was knocked off during the fight.\n\n“I guess this was his friend” Jack says.\n“I’m thinking it could have even been his girlfriend, smaller frame, even with the furs on I can see the chest is bigger. Long hair and from what I can tell of what’s left of the face, it looks slightly female…is that ear pointed?” you say.\n“…yeah…that ear is definitely pointed.” Jack says looking\n“What the hell, did we step into some sort of fantasy world?”\n“Your guess is as good as mine. Told you that Gray Building could have sent us any fucking where.”\n\nYou exhale, not quite knowing what to make of all this.\n\n“Let’s keep going a bit further.” You say.\n\nJack and you press on, but you don’t find any more signs of battle. You do eventually find that the wilderness ends and the edge of a road begins however. Sort of hard to tell due to the snow, but there definitely is a road here. Across the road are more trees. Sort of reminds you home that way.\n\n“Well I guess this is one of the roads, which means I guess I got something on this map correct at least. Looks like if we go south, we’ll hit the closest town. Still looks quite the like a walk though.” Jack responds.\n“Maybe we should cut the exploration trip a little short for today. Let’s gather all that useful stuff from that battle scene and take it back to the cabin. We can certainly use some of it. The boots on that girl look like they would be more likely to fit me anyway and wearing something like those would be a hell of a lot more pleasant for walking around in.” You say.\n“Okay, let’s go back.”\n\nYou and Jack return to the battle scene and begin looting the dead girl first. Along with the furs and her weapons, you also find a nearly empty quiver of arrows and a small pouch similar to the one that the man had. You take a quick look inside and see several items for you to inspect when you’re in the comfort of your much warmer cabin.\n\nWhen you and Jack are loaded up, you and he leave the dead woman mostly naked in the snow, much like you left the man and make your way back.\n\nUpon getting back to the body of the monster you attempt to pull out some of the bolts and arrows lodged in its body, but some are either partially broken off inside or just sunk in too deep and you’re not willing to make the effort to hang around and pull out every single one. The monster itself wasn’t carrying anything save for it’s minimalistic fur cloth around it’s waist and neither you or Jack are interested in taking it.\n\nSoon you both get back to the cabin where you drop your new loot and go warm up by the fire. The pair of you are silent as you sit, watching the flames flicker.\nJack however breaks up the silence eventually.\n\n“So, you really think that woman was the owner’s girlfriend?” Jack asks.\n“Maybe wife, I dunno how it works here. Seems like the logical conclusion though.” You respond.\n“Just didn’t notice a prominent second set of tracks around the cabin.”\n“Well it has been snowing off and on, there is the wind to think of, not to mention animals running around. Maybe she was walking behind him so she didn’t have to get her boots engulfed with snow. All sorts of reasons why you might not have noticed them. Don’t worry about it. Besides, you said it yourself, you’re not a tracker.”\n“I suppose. I guess I just feel that missing a detail like that could be fatal given what we’ve experienced as well as seen.”\n“Yeah, this does seem to be a pretty harsh place. Still don’t know what the hell that blue gray thing was. Definitely want to avoid encountering those things though…and those.” You say pointing to the ugly head on the wall.\n“I’ll get rid of that thing later today. I know it bothers you.” Jack says.\n“Nah, it can stay. I’m strangely sort of getting attached to Toothy over there.”\n\nA pause of silence in the conversation follows before Jack speaks up again.\n\n“If that was his wife or girlfriend though, that’s sort of fucked up that he just left her body like that.” Jack says.\n“Well, it seems like that thing was still chasing him, maybe he didn’t know if was dead or not and wanted to get to a place where he could better defend himself and heal a bit. He could have always returned for the body.” You say.\n“Maybe. I just want you to know I’ll never abandon you like that.” Jack says causing you to chuckle.\n\n“Well that’s sweet Jack, but if I already got my brains splattered on the ground and there’s a hulking monster around by all means run your ass to safety. No point in both of us getting killed.” You say.\n“I don’t even want to think about something like that. I just…I can’t imagine a life without you now.” Jack responds and grabs your hand.\n“Well with as brutal as this place seems to be, you never know.”\n“No, I can’t think about such depressing thoughts. I love you too much.”\n\nJack’s face displays one of concern, like he’s worried you’re going to die right this very second and he can’t even bear the thought of you gone. It’s apparent he’s fallen for you a bit hard; perhaps a bit more than you’ve fallen for him, but you suppose it’s better that he’s like this rather than not giving a shit.\n\nYou give him a reassuring hug.\n\n“Don’t worry so much Jack, I’ll try to last as long as I can in this world before the monsters get me.”\n“No, you’re going to survive. I bet you’ll even survive longer than I will. You’ll survive everything.”\n\nJack’s confidence in you is a lot higher than your own though you have to admit, you’ve been doing pretty well so far. You’re certainly not that “good girl” that hid from the rest of the world any longer.\n\nYou have no idea what’s in store for you or how you’re going to deal with it, but whatever the future hold for you here, you will make your best attempt to survive and push through it.\n",
  "page 13": "Running was always a tried and true tactic when you had to deal with Kelly’s bullying, no reason to change now…\n\nYou turn immediately to run to your trailer, but predictably Razor and her lot aren’t going to just let you get away.\n\n“Get that fuckin’ clown bitch!” Razor shouts.\n\nAs you rush past the other carnies you can’t help but notice none of them are trying to stop this. You start to think that maybe travelling with this fucked up carnival might not be in your future.\n\nWhen you get to your trailer the door is slightly ajar. You also notice a couple things out of place from last time, not to mention it looks like someone spent some time in your bed and soiled it with their “essence”.\n\nYou don’t have time to notice anything else, but its apparent that someone was here last night and you dodged a bullet, unfortunately you aren’t ducking twice.\n\nAs you attempt to lock your door, Razor smashes it open causing it to hit you in the face. While you reeling back from this, Razor has already picked you up and punched you in the face. The rest of her goons are right behind her.\n\n“Lock that door, I wanna enjoy this!” Razor orders one of her crew and pulls out a straight razor.\n\n“Now, I’m do you a favor. I’m gonna cut your mouth so wide that you’ll be able to chug three cocks at the same time. You’ll be able to make it part of your act, Sucko the clown!” Razor says and lunges at you.\n\nNaturally you’re not going to just let her give you a Glasglow smile, so you try to defend yourself. You manage to throw a few nearby items at her, but it isn’t enough to stop her. In fact, your struggling makes her “accidently” stab you in throat and cutting an artery.\n\nYou fall to the bed clutching your neck, which is bleeding profusely.\n\n“SHIT!” Razor shouts.\n“Fuck! I didn’t think we were going to kill her!” one of her goons says.\n“I wasn’t trying to, but the bitch kept struggling. Let’s get outta here!” she shouts and soon all of them have left your trailer.\n\nYou on the other hand continue to bleed out and soon die from your wound.\n",
  "page 12": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n“Hey Suzy get up, time to start packing up.” Klepto says tapping your shoulder.\n“Okay…” you reply groggily. You don’t feel a small figure near the bottom your legs so you assume Shrimpy must’ve already gotten up.\n\n“Well that wasn’t that bad, Shrimpy even honored the agreement.” You say sitting up.\n“Or maybe you’re just a really sound sleeper.” Klepto remarks.\n“Hrm, well if that’s the case he better at least have the sense to not brag about it. Anyway, I suppose I’ll take my leave to wash up a bit and change clothes.”\n“Wish I could come with you.” Klepto says.\n“Excuse me?” you say.\n“Ha ha ha no not that, I meant it sucks having to share the small ass bathroom we have in this trailer. Fatty’s in there right now and well you can figure out how it’s going to be after he leaves.”\n“Yeah, I’d rather not have that mental image right now. See you around.” You say and start to leave.\n“Wait, uh Suzy…I…” Klepto calls out.\n“Yes?”\n“(Sigh) Look I know I probably haven’t been showing exactly prince charming behavior, but I just want to say, I really like you. I mean REALLY like you.”\n“Yeah I got that impression a long time ago.” You respond.\n“Yeah, but I’m trying to say it’s not just physical.”\n“I find that a little harder to believe…however I’m not really going to fault you for it, but I’m going to need a lot more proof that you want something deeper than just sex.”\n“Well what? Like a ring or something?”\n“Heh, I don’t think you’re exactly in a financial position for all that. Look, I like you too, but this probably isn’t the best time to expect anything more from me than just friendship. I’m still trying to get used to the fact of this being my new life now not to mention I’m just getting over breaking up with what was my first and only boyfriend. So I might prefer my own company for a while. However that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t TRY to gain my affection. But only IF you REALLY want something meaningful with me. If not, then I’d suggest that you not waste either of our time and you go find a less discerning mate. I don’t need prince charming either, I just need someone I can count on and isn’t going to be a complete jerk. And if it helps, so far you’re doing a little bit better in that department than anyone else here.”\n“Okay.” Klepto says with a nod and brief smile before you leave.\n\nWell there it is, someone has openly professed a desire to be your boyfriend. You knew it was going to be one of them eventually though. You can only imagine the others will be attempting to woo you as well just like in your routine with them. Funny how life starts to imitate art.\n\nYou don’t know how sincere Klepto is even if he has been pleasant for the most part. (Can you really ever trust a guy with the name Klepto?)\n\nAttractiveness wise, Klepto probably is the best of the lot. Lifto would probably provide the best protection, but the guy is tough to look at even with clown make up on and as far as Fatty is concerned, the only thing that runs through your mind is potential sexual positions and only one of which doesn’t result in you being crushed.\n\nPart of you wonders if you’re bad for being shallow, but then you remember they’re all attracted to you mostly due to your looks in the first place.\n\nThough for some reason you find Shrimpy’s size adorable… in fact you might find some of the others dwarves that work here adorable as well if they weren’t quite so vulgar with you. Maybe you’ve got a hidden dwarf fetish you didn’t know about before.\n\nOh well, you’re not going to worry about any of this right now.\n\nAs you head back to your own trailer, you see most of the dwarves doing all the labor of packing down the carnival; others are helping, but most are just packing down their own respective stages and such.\n\n“Hey clown slut, if you’re not actually going to be sleeping in your own trailer and just going to be playing cum dumpster to your painted freak friends, the least you can do is give it to one of us!” a tattooed lady with big black Mohawk and several piercings in her face remarks catching you off guard. A couple of other tattooed women stand behind her agreeing with her statement. You briefly remember her calling you names from yesterday. Her name’s Razor and she does a human pincushion type act.\n\n“I didn’t use my trailer last night, because I didn’t feel safe by myself.” You say.\n“Oh? Just a scared little babe in the woods huh? Well you’re by yourself now. What’re you going to do without your clown crew to protect you?” Razor remarks and pokes you in the chest with her finger.\n\nYou look around and while there are a couple of people standing by, none of them are helping you. While Razor isn’t much bigger than you, she definitely looks tougher. Combine that with the fact she has two friends that also look like they’ll join in and you don’t think you’ll stand a chance if it actually came down to a fight.\n",
  "page 14": "Maybe this isn’t the best idea you’ve ever had, but after all those years of dealing with your sister Kelly, you aren’t going to put up with bullying anymore.\n\nYou’ve never really been a fighter before (Trying to protect your face from Kelly’s couple attempts to disfigure you don’t count) so it isn’t surprising that when you throw a punch at Razor she easily dodges and catches your arm.\n\n“Oh ho! Harley Quinn has some fight in her! Good, didn’t want this to be too easy!” Razor says and throws you to the ground. Before you can get up you feel a kick to your ribs.\n\nLacking any other tactics you lunge at one of Razor’s legs and sink your teeth into it hard enough to draw blood.\n\n“AH SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK!” Razor yells trying to get you off of her leg, at this point her friends step in to help pull you off. You’re dragged off and restrained while Razor takes a moment to examine her wound.\n\n“Goddamn it! Shit!” Razor exclaims looking at the fairly deep bite wound you’ve left.\n“I thought you were a human pincushion, what’s the matter can’t handle a few little teeth?” you ask spitting blood in Razor’s direction.\n“Hope you enjoyed yourself, because that’s the last time you’re going to be using those pearly whites. Say hello to eating through a straw from now on, but look on the bright side, the next time you engage in your favorite past time of sucking clown dick, they won’t have to worry about getting scraped.” Razor says and starts to walk toward you, but suddenly Roofie stops her.\n\n“Alright that will do Razor, I saw what happened and I’ll not have unnecessary strife in this carnival! Go back to packing down your stage!” Roofie scolds.\n\nRazor looks at him a moment and then you and then waves to her friends to let you go.\n\n“One day you aren’t going to be running this show Roofie.” Razor says as she leaves with her friends.\n“Maybe not, but that day isn’t today.” Roofie says.\n\nAs you get up and try to brush yourself off, Roofie slowly walks over to you. He already smells like alcohol.\n\n“Well Suzy, first Ranko, now Razor, looks like you’re just making friends all over.”\n“It’s not my fault! I didn’t do anything to her!”\n“I know you didn’t, you alright?”\n“Yeah, but now I probably got a target on my back, one of many probably since Razor isn’t the only one who hates me around here.”\n“Yeah I’ve noticed. Just because I’m half drunk most of the time doesn’t mean I’m not aware of what goes on around here. Listen some of the negative feelings that some have for you will die down in time. You seem to be getting along with your new clown co-workers very well though. You spent the night over in their trailer despite the fact you have your own.”\n“I only did that because I didn’t feel safe sleeping alone last night. There was a really creepy big guy staring at me all day yesterday, I dunno maybe I was just being paranoid.”\n“Hmm, did you wish to bunk with them or even someone else then? I mean I can make arrangements if you feel uncomfortable sleeping alone.”\n“No, I appreciate the fact you gave me my own trailer. Besides, given all the new friends I’m making, I’d be safer sleeping alone and bunking with Klepto and the rest, well I get the impression that would cause other problems.” You say.\n“Okay then. Well, I’ll let you get back to your trailer. We’ll probably be ready to go just before nightfall so I’m sure Lifto will be around then to hook this thing up to one of our trucks. So until then just enjoy the downtime.”\n“Wait, aren’t I supposed to be helping pack up the carnival?”\n“You? Nah, the rest of the guys can handle it. Really I get the impression they wouldn’t let you do much work anyway what with them all being enamored with you and all. And the dwarves got the overall pack up covered. Always have, it’s what they do. Backbone of the carnival and all…and all a bit of a waste of time given what’s to come, but hey we do what we know.” Roofie says and leaves.\n\nA little more cryptic future doom prediction by Roofie, you get the impression that’s his general personality, but at least he’s always pleasant with you.\n\nWith no more distractions you arrive at your trailer and that’s when you begin to feel nervous again.\n\nFirst of all the door is slightly ajar. You also notice a couple things out of place from last time, not to mention it looks like someone spent some time in your bed and soiled it with their “essence”. Your cell phone that you left here is also gone, but given that its batteries were starting to die and you wouldn’t have Bobby to pay for it much longer it isn’t much of a loss. Someone was definitely here last night. You don’t know if it was Ranko, that big creepy retard staring at you or someone else, but either way you dodged a bullet.\n\nYou half expect the person to jump out at you from some hidden spot, but that doesn’t happen. Whoever was here, probably left before the morning, and probably when they realized you weren’t coming here.\n\nYou re-check all the trailer’s locations (even if it isn’t the biggest place) and block the door with a chair before feeling safe enough to shower and get changed.\n\nAfterwards you go through the mundane process of actually cleaning up the trailer. You figure if you don’t need to help pack up the carnival, you can at least spend your time clean up your living area. (First thing is throwing out the befouled bed sheet)\n\nBy the time you’re finished it’s the afternoon and you’re tired again. You’re still not used to being awake so early and you didn’t get much sleep last night so you lie down in your now cleaner bed and shut your eyes for just a bit…\n\nYou don’t know how much time passes while you’re asleep again, but when you do wake up it’s to a loud thumping at the door.\n\n“OPEN UP BY ORDER OF THE U.S. NATIONAL GUARD!”\n\nNational Guard? What the hell is going on?\n\n“Hold on, hold on, I’m getting up!” you shout.\n“Open the door miss or we’ll be forced to bash it open!” a voice calls back.\n\nNot wishing to potentially get shot you comply and upon opening the door several national guardsmen stand outside.\n\n“Come with us miss, we need you all together for your safety.” A young soldier says guiding you out.\n“Where are we going?” you ask.\n“Just to that big tent over there. Don’t worry, this is all for your protection.”\n\nSomehow you don’t quite believe that, but when you scan your surroundings, you see that the carnival appears to be under control by the National Guard so there isn’t much choice but to comply. You don’t know why or how this came to be, but from some of the military radios you overhear it sounds like riots have broken out in your town. Is this some sort of martial law?\n\nWhen you arrive in the big tent, most of carnival is there. Most are sitting at tables and complaining about this fate. You see Roofie actively arguing with one of the higher ranking soldiers who looks utterly unmoved by what he has to say.\n\n“Goddamnit, just because people are rioting in the town doesn’t mean any bullshit is going on here! We’re not even locals! We’re just passing through and were about to leave!” Roofie says.\n“Yeah I heard you the first time, but my orders are to secure this entire area and will be under watch until further notice. Now I suggest you get out of my face before I stomp a mud hole in your ass clown!” the officer remarks and walks out of the tent.\n\nYou go over to Roofie.\n\n“What’s going on exactly?” you ask.\n“End times like I always knew would come Suzy. Just didn’t figure I’d have to spend my last days stuck under the gun by a bunch of fascists! These government dickheads think they can control what’s coming soon, when they really can’t control shit. These fools don’t even know they’re all really just puppets for that fucking Ground Zero corporation that’s been shilling bomb shelters ads all over the damn place.”\n\nThis is definitely a new side you’ve seen of Roofie, he’s really mad. He’s also really drunk even if he’s pretty coherent. You see Klepto and the rest waving you over.\n\n“Why don’t we just go over there and…”\n“Y’know what Suzy? There aren’t even that many of these fuckers. It’s a skeleton crew at best. I bet we can take them. I mean we certainly outnumber them.”\n“What?! Are you nuts? They’re armed with machine guns!” you say.\n“And? So a few of us die? We’re ALL gonna be dead soon anyway, why wait? Better to die on your feet than live on your knees. Seriously, all we gotta do is get a couple of those guns away from them and it already evens up the playing field. Seriously you think they’re probably going to let us live anyway? They’re probably going to line us up like baby seals and blow our brains out by tomorrow. I’m telling you I’m getting our own troops in order to rebel tonight.”\n\nRoofie seems pretty intent on going through with this plan, the only thing you can think of to do is either try to help or try to prevent the violence.\n",
  "page 17": "Roofie’s plan isn’t going to accomplish anything except get a bunch of people killed, and you could be one of them! You think fast.\n\n“Uh, okay Roofie, let’s just go over here and get the battle plan together first okay? I’m sure Klepto and the rest are going to want to hear this first.”\n“Hrgh, okay. You don’t need to guide me damn it, I’m not that drunk!” Roofie says and pulls his arm away from your hand.\n\nWhen you get to Klepto’s table he and the rest know something is wrong when Roofie starts going on about “bum rushing those government puppet bastards.” Shrimpy and Fatty both attempt to calm him down, but he’s not having any of it.\n\n“What the hell is going on Suzy? Roofie’s talkin’ crazier than usual.” Klepto asks.\n“He wants to have the entire carnival attack the National Guard, do something before he causes too much of a scene.” You say.\n“Do something like what? You don’t mean kill him do you?!” Klepto asks.\n“No! But I dunno maybe knock him out to buy us time and he can sober up or something. Lifto, knock him out.” You say.\n“Me?! Why me?” Lifto asks.\n“Because you’re the strongest of all of us and I’m guessing you could do it in one hit. Just do it, before he gets all of us killed!”\n\nLifto’s a little reluctant and probably wouldn’t do it normally, but it the situation does seem dire enough so while Roofie is continuing to rant at Shrimpy and Fatty he punches Roofie in the back of the head, knocking the older man completely out and falling into Fatty’s arms.\n\nSome of the other carnies have witnessed this, but they don’t seem to do anything about it. In fact it just goes to show how little most of them respect Roofie in the scheme of the things. Sort of a shame.\n\n“Holy shit, did you have to punch him so hard? He’s an old guy! You might’ve put him in a coma!” Shrimpy remarks.\n“I just did what Suzy told me!”\n“Alright look, I didn’t want harm to come to Roofie either, but the guy needed to be silenced for at least a moment. I think the bigger problem we’ve got is the other carnies. I get the sense that they think Roofie is no longer a factor in the leadership role, so expect a power play. We all need to stick together for protection.”\n“What about the National Guard? I mean shouldn’t we be worrying about them?” Lifto asks.\n“The National Guard is what’s keeping this carnival from exploding into an orgy of violence right now. Nobody’s going to risk pissing them off by causing problems, well not now at least without Roofie’s plan of stirring them all up.” You reply.\n\n“Well what the hell do we do now?” Klepto asks.\n“I don’t know! I mean I’m just thinking on my feet here! You all told me that we’re the most hated group in the carnival, so we should make friends somehow? Shrimpy, do you have ANY pull with the dwarves?”\n“Pull? I suppose I have enough for me, I mean even as a clown deep down I’ll always be a dwarf. But as I’ve mentioned before I can’t promise anything for the rest of you.”\n“Well I dunno, do some diplomacy or something. As for the rest of us, we need to just stick to our table and look after Roofie, and make sure he’s doing okay throughout the night. Maybe I’ll try to charm one of the soldiers or something. The key thing to remember is we need to survive this together.”\n\nYou never thought you’d start sounding like your older brother Ben with the whole survivalist shtick, but if it helps thinking like a paranoid person then you aren’t going to dismiss such thoughts.\n\nAs night starts to fall the mood in the large army “quarantine” tent grows more restless. Two guardsmen remain on duty at all times though they’re not exactly happy about the situation either. You do manage to get friendly with one of them by the name of Roger and extract a bit more info.\n\nRoger tells you that you and the rest of your carny friends shouldn’t worry too much since this is just a formality. He says that things are much worse in the town and expects his unit will be transferred to support his fellow guardsmen there in a day or two. At which point you’ll all be free to go.\n\nHearing about the mass riots in town makes you wonder how things are going for your family. You’re almost sort of worried about them, even Kelly, but there isn’t much that can be done now. Hopefully they’ve found some sort of safety.\n\n“Is this going on everywhere?” you ask.\n“Well I don’t know a lot of detail, I’m just a grunt in the scheme of things, but things are getting pretty bad, I mean haven’t you heard the news lately?” Roger says.\n“Not really, sort of disconnected from the rest of the world lately.” You say.\n“Well world tensions have been really high, it’s like every country is gearing up for world war three and domestically people have seemingly gone batshit insane with regards to the rules of common decency and morality. I guess a lot of people are just scared and I can’t blame them on some level, but we still need law and order. Surely you can understand that right?”\n“Sure.” You say in agreement since you’d rather not make any potential enemies of the military even if it is just one grunt.\n\nIn any case Roger smiles when you agree, you get the impression he’s just as concerned being out here. After a few more pleasantries, Roger says he really needs to get back to “standing guard” and not talking to you as his superior is a real hard ass and he doesn’t want to get into trouble or you for that matter. You thank him for the talk and head back to your colleagues.\n\nOf course some of the carnies seeing you get “cozy” with one of the guardsmen makes them even dislike you even more and you occasionally hear mutterings and name calling by others. Razor hasn’t taken her eyes off of you the whole time you’ve been here. She’s obviously got her sights set on you, regardless of what goes down, she’s just waiting for opportunity.\n\nOn the plus side when Shrimpy returns he says that while the dwarves are going to make their own play when the time is right, he’s managed to convince them not to attack the clowns as long as you stay out of their way. (And apparently they’re ONLY extending that courtesy because of Shrimpy’s ties as well you being…well you, though the female dwarves predictably don’t like you too much)\n\nThe night goes on and while everyone is in a heightened state of readiness nobody can stay awake forever, so eventually people start falling asleep though its mostly in shifts for most groups and you are no exception.\n\nEventually though when it’s your turn to sleep, you try to find some sort of comfort on one of the many sleeping mats provided. It’s pretty much impossible, but exhaustion helps you along.\n\nEventually you drift off…\n",
  "page 16": "“Okay well maybe you’ve got a point, but can you really stir this lot up to swarm attack people with machine guns?” you ask.\n“One way to find out!” Roofie says and without another word he runs over to the nearest guard and smashes a bottle over his head. It might’ve been more effective had the guardsman not had a helmet on.\n\nThe guardsman that was assaulted bashes Roofie to the ground and fires several shots into him. This causes shock from everyone and in your case you even freeze up for a moment. Nobody is bum rushing the guardsmen though.\n\nRoofie won’t be getting up again, but at this point the guardsmen continue to panic and believe they’re under a greater attack. (Despite that everyone is too scared to do so)\n\n“SHIT! WE NEED BACK UP! WE’RE UNDER ATTACK!” the other guardsman exclaims and begins firing randomly at carnies, which includes you.\n\nUnfortunately, you were close enough that you fatally get hit by some of these bullets despite trying to get out of the way.\n",
  "page 22": "Roger is so busy keeping a look out for running into his buddies and getting to your trailer he’s now suitably distracted and while you’re so close to him, you easily grab his pistol.\n\n“HEY WHAT…” he exclaims as you back away quickly and hold the gun on him.\n“Drop the rifle!” you shout. He doesn’t though.\n\n“Shit. I should’ve known better. Ernie’s going to have a field day.” Roger says.\n“Sorry Roger, but I really need you to drop that rifle!” you say.\n“…nah…if you had it in you to shoot me, you would’ve by now. You’ve never shot a person and this whole situation is scary to you. You’re hoping your sex appeal will be enough to carry you through this and that I’ll be weak willed enough that I won’t call your bluff and just shoot you dead right now.”\n\nThat’s an incredible amount insight for someone you thought was nothing more than just a horny grunt. Unfortunately he’s pretty much on target.\n\nFor a moment there is a pause and you look at him hopefully, you even manage to start tearing up a bit.\n\n“(Sigh) Look, I told you we were going to leave soon, I dunno why you feel the need to go through this elaborate escape plan when it really isn’t necessary. Just hand the pistol over and we’ll head back to the tent.”\n\nYou’re too scared of what might happen if you just surrender, so all you can do is continue to aim it at Roger.\n\n“Suzy, I’m not fucking around now give me the…” Roger begins to say and moves towards you. With his rifle slightly lowered and his hand outstretched, you nervously fire two shots at him. At this range you don’t miss even though you’re in a heightened state of anxiety.\n\nRoger falls to the ground with two in his chest and doesn’t move, you’ve killed him.\n\n“Oh my…oh god I’m sorry…(Sniff)” you say.\n\nThe shots of course have drawn the attention of the other guardsmen. You hear shouting which is getting closer to your location, so you run.\n\nYou hear more shouting followed by gunfire. At first you think they’ve seen you and are shooting at you, but that isn’t the case when you start to hear a few screams.\n\nNow you’re even more scared as you have no idea what’s going on. Did the carnies take advantage of this situation and start to fight back? You have no idea, but you don’t intend on sticking around.\n\nYou duck and hide the best you can through the small maze of trailers and vehicles. The screams, shouting and gunfire are now accompanied by unnatural growing. Like animals of some sort.\n\nUnfortunately as you reach the far end of the carnival limits you are ambushed by something skulking behind the corner of the last trailer you were passing and the pistol goes sprawling out of your hand.\n\nYou don’t even know what it is, except that you’re on the ground and it’s on your back breathing heavily and making that growling sound you heard. You then feel teeth sink deep into your shoulder.\n\nPain and fear both rise up in you for a moment as you struggle to get free, but this thing what ever it is has a strong grip and with one of its hands it smashes your face repeatedly into the ground into your struggling becomes less, then it breaks your neck before feasting on the rest of your dead body.\n",
  "page 21": "While it might be an opportunity to escape, you’re not going to risk it. Roger might be a little smitten with you, but he’s athletic enough looking that you don’t think you could easily fight him off if something went wrong. Given that there is a state of martial law right now, you’re likely to get yourself shot or worse.\n\nBetter to stay in the tent and come up with a plan where you at least might have some back up.\n\nSo you’re currently back to square one, sitting around doing much of nothing until the National Guard decides to leave (whenever if and when that happens).\n\nYou spend most of your time thinking on what Roofie said and your current position at the carnival. The only way you’re ever going to have safety and have a family is if you take direct action towards those goals.\n\n“Lifto, Shrimpy, you’re with me.” You suddenly say and say you going to see the head of the dwarf faction.\n“Uh, I dunno if that’s a good idea, he’s been doing a lot of preparation lately.” Shrimpy says.\n“I’m sure he has, and its in our best interest to find out exactly what that is. Maybe YOU can afford to play both sides, but I’m not taking that chance.” You say and start walking over to the crowd of little people.\n\nAs you approach, the dwarves instantly start closing ranks and their demeanor changes to a defensive one.\n\n“Back again Shrimpy? I didn’t anticipate your sycophantic antics for another hour or so. And you must be Suzy, the new clown girl that’s been pissing off all the ladies and turning on all the guys. Hrm. Upon a closer look, I understand the appeal, but you’re still no dwarf woman.” an older dwarf says, though many of his fellows probably don’t share that opinion.\n“I take it you’re the leader of your group?”\n“Yep, though I don’t suppose Shrimpy’s bothered to mention my name is Billy. If you’re here about our current alliance, you needn’t worry since I’ve reassured Shrimpy so many times about it that it’s getting to the point of annoyance. Glad to you at least changed it up by appearing yourself, could’ve done without the big ugly clown behind you though, but I’m guessing he’s a poor attempt at intimidation.”\n“A girl likes to have a big strong man to watch her back sometimes.”\n“Heh, and that’s why you’ve practically begged a bunch of little men to do it to eh? Let’s cut to the chase, what do you really want? I already know that you’re the new leader of the clowns given what you did to old Roofie over there. Bet he didn’t see that coming.”\n\nYou don’t know how else to put it so you just say it, which comes to a surprise to Shrimpy and Lifto as well.\n\n“I’m going to be the new leader of this carnival and YOU’RE going to support me in this endeavor.”\nBilly smiles at this remark and then chuckles. Several of the other dwarves do likewise.\n\n“You? Really? And you think we’re just going to support you in this? I hope you had a better plan than preparing to fuck every munchkin in munchkin land Dorothy, because at this juncture I guarantee that would be the ONLY way that you MIGHT come close to your dreams of being in charge. And if that was your plan, you can forget it, because I’m happily married. However, it might gain you favor with some of my friends. Could ensure that your group will have a place in the new carnival order that will be coming soon, but that’s a choice you’ll have to make on your own.”\n“You really think the rest of the carnival is going to follow you?”\n“They won’t have a choice, we dwarves have always been the backbone of it and it’s about time we just took the spotlight. Just like my Great Uncle Charley always wanted to do so long ago.”\n“Yeah and apparently that didn’t work out so well given your current situation. You know why? Nobody truly respects you. They’re content to let you do the grunt work, but they don’t want you to be in the spotlight, unless you’re making a fool of yourself like Shrimpy here.” You say.\n“HEY!” Shrimpy remarks.\n“Watch your tone there blondie, you’re starting to tread on very dangerous ground.” Billy warns.\n“Yes, I know and I’m also trying to explain that you’re ALREADY in control by being the backbone of the carnival. You might very well be able to win this internal struggle, but would there be anything left? This place has languished under Roofie, obviously, but it could be great again if it had the right ring master. Someone who could bring in the people. You said it yourself, I’ve got most of the guys here salivating over me just by my presence. You know how advertising works, I bring ‘em in with a wink, a smile and some sweet talk, the other performers get the money out of them and someone has to keep the infrastructure together and that’s you. We could work together as a more than just co-workers we could be like…a family. Like how carnies are supposed to really stick together.”\n\nYour words give a moment of pause for Billy who ponders them for a moment, but then shakes his head.\n\n“Y’know, that’s a really good speech, the problem is you haven’t been here but a few days and you’re already trying to take over. In family terms, you’re like the hot twenty year old nurse that married great grandpa on his death bed in the hopes of inheriting everything despite the fact he’s got a multitude of family members that are far more deserving since they had to put up with his shit a lot longer. Now that doesn’t mean I don’t think you’re sincere or even that your idea isn’t a worthy one, its just I don’t see YOU as that potential leader. If this carnival does split apart after the dust clears, well maybe it was meant to be, but I’m not spending the remainder of my life following another half-assed leader again. So to sum up, if you want to be on our side then great, if not, then I highly suggest you all get in your clown car and all get jobs at a rodeo or something.”\n\nAt this point Billy’s done talking and waves you all away.\n\nWell that could’ve went better.\n\n“Are you nuts?! Why the hell did you do that for? You’re lucky he isn’t cancelling our protection!” Shrimpy says.\n“Well I can’t say it was the best of moves, but I guess you had to try.” Lifto says.\n\nBetween Shrimpy’s concern for his own self-preservation and Lifto’s impotent comment, you’re wondering if you shouldn’t re-consider trying to escape again.\n\nUltimately you all head back to the table where upon Shrimpy and Lifto explain what happened. Fatty and Klepto are both surprised by your actions, but Klepto again makes the usual attempt at being more “understanding” than the others. Christ, he never quits.\n\n“I don’t need this right now, I’m going to be by myself.” You say grabbing the small radio that they were listening to and head to where Roofie is still lying on his mat with his eyes closed. You don’t know if he’s still awake or genuinely asleep now, but he at least doesn’t appear to be in any mood to bother you right now.\n\nYou spend a few more hours listening to one of the radios while the others play cards and try to talk about mundane things. You’re not getting the best reception and it’s no Internet, but it’s better than nothing.\n\nYou mostly listen to a lot of special breaking news talking about how bad things are getting in various parts of the world. You hear about the riots going on and think about your own town and how your “real” family is doing. Ben’s hidden personal bomb shelter was somewhere in the backyard, you wonder if you shouldn’t have just tried to look for it and moved in there, it probably was stocked.\n\nThen as the sun starts setting, you hear a bunch of shooting and shouting outside. You see the other guardsmen near the tent entrance rush off, leaving everyone unsupervised.\n\nNaturally no longer being supervised means chaos within the tent begins to erupt though you have no idea why people aren’t more concerned about why the National Guardsmen are shooting and yelling at something outside.\n\nLacking any better idea, you try to wake up Roofie, but he doesn’t stir.\n\n“Oh shit…” you say to yourself.\n\nApparently his last words to you WERE his dying request literally.\n\nWhile you’re the only one aware of poor Roofie’s unexpected passing, a full on fight in the tent breaks out. Predictably, it’s Razor and her faction vs. Billy and his faction. Some of the smaller factions join in while others just run out of the tent altogether. It’s very lucky that your group is nowhere near the center of the tent where the fighting is and more or less in a corner.\n\n“Suzy! It’s begun!” Lifto shouts.\n“Yeah! We need to get in and help Billy or we’re going to be next!” Shrimpy adds.\n",
  "page 23": "You aren’t confident that you’d make it with trying to ambush Roger. While it’s possible you’ll get some sort of better opportunity while in the trailer, at this point you’re going to hope that Roger isn’t an asshole and this will actually get him to help you escape.\n\nThat’s a lot to place on hope, but it’s going to have to do.\n\nSoon you get to your trailer and you enter it with Roger still looking around before going in himself.\n\nYou stand by your bed and look at it and then look at Roger.\n\n“So here we are.” He says.\n“Yeah…so here we are…” you reply.\n“Well? Come on, we don’t have much time.” Roger says and puts his weapons down though of course he puts them out your reach and starts guiding you to lay down on the bed.\n\nThis is going to happen. It isn’t that Roger isn’t unattractive to you and this isn’t exactly like he’s coercing you to do anything (though you’re afraid he might if you resist at this point) its just…well directly using your pussy to get yourself out of a jam isn’t exactly how you do things. Indirectly by teasing and flirting? Sure you’ve gotten used to doing that, but this is a step you don’t think you’re ready to take and it’s too late at this point.\n\nRoger is already stripping his clothes off and you’re slowly doing likewise. Soon the pair of you are naked and his dick’s coming at you like a monster. As he moves in to kiss and embrace you, you stop him.\n\n“Um…could we not look at each other while we do this?” you say.\n“Huh?” he asks, almost looking a bit wounded by that comment.\n“Uh, I just mean can we do it doggy style? I just prefer it that way.” You ask.\n“Oh. Well yeah! Sure, however you want it. I’m cool with that.” Roger says and you get into position.\n\nWell at least now you can close your eyes and pretend its Bobby. Hopefully Roger isn’t much of a talker and just gets on with it.\n\nWhile you prepare yourself for this “experience”, gunshots are suddenly heard outside. Several of them in fact. This is followed by a lot of shouting.\n\n“Oh fuck! What the hell?!” Roger exclaims and no longer do you feel his hands at your haunches, he’s gotten off the bed.\n\nYou turn over and see him starting to get dressed, periodically looking out the narrow windows.\n\n“What’s going on out there?!” you ask.\n“I have no idea, but whatever it is, YOU stay inside and keep down. I don’t want you getting hurt.”\n\nYou start to get dressed as well, wondering what calamity has happened now. Did the carnies finally decide to rush the guardsmen?\n\nRoger, with his clothes back on, grabs his rifle and pistol and prepares to head out.\n\n“Suzy, remember what I said, stay inside…OH SHIT!” Roger shouts as he opens the door.\n\nSomething humanoid runs into Roger who drops his rifle and is pinned against the wall. It’s growling and snarling and Roger is holding its neck in an attempt to not let it bite him.\n\nFear grips you, but not so much that you can’t grab a nearby knife from the kitchen area in an effort to stab it.\n\n“Suzy stay back! I got it!” Roger shouts and manages to shove the thing off of him and out the door. He then pulls out his pistol and presumably fires at the thing several times. He then slams the door shut and attempts to lock and barricade it.\n\n“Did you kill it?” you ask.\n“I dunno. I think I did.” Roger answers.\n“You think? Don’t you think you better know?!”\n“Yes! Yes! I killed it! I mean I put two it’s head and three in its chest. Jesus Christ, gimme a moment here! One moment I was nearly in paradise and the next I’m fending off a fucking…zombie…or something…shit I dunno what the hell…” Roger says trying to wrap his head around this unexpected turn of events.\n\nZombie. Did he just say that thing was a zombie? It was humanoid and trying to bite him, while making snarling and growling sounds. Then again it didn’t look exactly rotten, could’ve been new dead though. Maybe just a rabid human?\n\nSeems silly that you’re actually considering that you’re getting attacked by zombies. Never the less, the gunfire and chaos you’re hearing outside seems to suggest you’re being attacked by SOMETHING.\n\nMeanwhile Roger is sitting and mumbling to himself. Suddenly he stands up.\n\n“Fuck it. Suzy, you still wanna get out of here right?” Roger says.\n“Well of course.” You say.\n“Come on, we’re taking one of those trucks. I got the keys.”\n“Okay? But what about your friends?”\n“Hah, most of those guys I serve with are assholes. I mean you saw my commanding officer and Ernie. Can’t say any of them are my friends. What about you and your carnie family?”\n“Well… the clowns were cool with me and the owner…but well it’s complicated and let’s just say I wasn’t fitting in there, so while I do feel slightly guilty just abandoning the ones that I was getting along with, I can’t stay someplace where I don’t feel entirely welcome or safe.”\n“Okay, then its settled, we’ll leave now.”\n“But what about those things out there?”\n“Well we’re going to have to grab the truck now because either one or two things is going to happen. One, the rest of my squad is going to put these things down and both of us are going to be up shit’s creek or those things are going to kill everyone and we’ll have to brave through them while they’re not distracted by others.”\n\nRoger unblocks the door and kicks it open, ready to shoot anything that might be lurking outside, fortunately that isn’t the case right now.\n\n“Alright let’s do this and stick close to me.” he says and the pair of you run out the trailer.\n\nThe sounds of creatures and gunfire are all around you and you haven’t stepped out of the trailer a few seconds when Roger has to shoot two more of the things. He doesn’t hit them in the head and they still stay down, so you’re guessing maybe the zombie thing isn’t the case. Still don’t want to get bit though, who knows if this is contagious?\n\nYou see a few dead bodies of guardsmen on the ground and in one case one of those cannibals eating it and not paying any attention to anything else. The fact that the sounds of gunfire dying down and an increase in the screaming and yelling signals to you that things are getting grim. You wonder if they’ve gotten to the carnies yet.\n\nIs this going on everywhere? Is this local? You’ll have to figure that out later. Right now you’re just happy to get inside a heavy-duty military truck.\n\nRoger gets in the driver’s seat and with more snarling creatures banging on the doors and trying to get in, Roger starts up the truck and promptly runs over three of them on your way out this place.\n\nSoon you’re on the road, but what next?\n\n“Where are we going?” you ask.\n“I dunno. If this is some sort of plague or invasion or something I’m wondering if we shouldn’t head to Fort Timons, it’s the closest military facility around here and where I was stationed before I got sent here. Still quite a drive though.” Roger says.\n“What? Are you nuts? Didn’t you just go AWOL and now you’re thinking about going to an military base?”\n“Well… I mean yeah technically I just deserted my post…but considering it didn’t seem like anyone else is going to live through that attack I doubt if anyone is going to call me out on it. We could just tell them we were the only survivors.”\n“But if this is some sort of disease will a military base even be safe? I mean don’t these sorts of thing originate from them what with all the secret experiments and bioweapons?”\n“What? You watch too many horror movies or science fiction! Unless its some secret base with top level government security, the average ordinary military base isn’t going to have a lab where they’re making bioweapons! In any case I know that stuff isn’t at Fort Timons.”\n“I dunno…just doesn’t seem the safest place.”\n“Well where do you propose then?”\n\nYou don’t have an answer.\n\n“See? Look, it’s still a long drive there, maybe I can get something on the radio and we can find out more. Too bad this one doesn’t have a two-way radio, we’d actually be able to communicate with someone and I lost my fucking cell phone. In fact I probably left it in your trailer.”\n\nAs Roger attempts to get a signal on the radio, you think about how you’ve now run away from two “families” and who knows what’s become of both of them. Are they dead? Are they alive? Has you hometown been overrun by those things? Is it under marshal law?\n\nYou feel a little sad about it all, but what can you really do?\n\nAs the day eventually turns into night, Roger continues to try to get something on the radio, but its just static on the military channel he’s using. He doesn’t understand it. Switching over to the normal radio just gets music, which is broken up by the periodic Ground Zero advert. Absolutely nothing about the creatures though, not even regular news. It’s very frustrating.\n\nYour aren’t encountering too much traffic on the road either, granted this isn’t the busiest of roads, but it feels fairly isolated. Still, at least you’re not seeing a horde of those things roaming about.\n\nRoger talks a little about his past to break up the long periods of silence, most of it fairly mundane. You just mainly listen although you’re only really half listening and re-direct questions about yourself to something superficial. You’re not in the mood to talk about yourself.\n\nEventually you start to get sleepy and Roger does as well. He pulls over and the both of you go to sleep and thankfully he never once suggests picking up where you left off in your trailer.\n\nNothing like a bunch of cannibal creatures to break up the mood.\n\nYou drift off to sleep…\n",
  "page 26": "Something in your heart is telling you that going to Fort Timons would be a huge mistake. The length of the trip and the possibility that it’s going to be swarming with those things just doesn’t seem safe. This place might not be safe either, but at least it’s a secure place that you don’t need to travel any further to.\n\n“Suzy, I still think going to Timons is a better idea than staying here. I’m going, so if you want to stay…” Roger says before you interrupt him.\n\nYou grip Roger by the head with both hands and move it downwards so you can kiss him on the lips. The kiss is then followed your arms moving downward in a tighter hugging motion. He returns in kind as the pair of you continue to embrace.\n\n“Don’t go. Please don’t go to Fort Timons. It won’t be safe and I need you here with me.” You say stopping your kiss to speak.\n“Suzy…”\n“Please. Stay with me.”\n“(Sigh) Suzy… do you really mean this? I mean I really need to know where we stand…because…you can’t just flutter your eyes and kiss me without meaning it now. I’m really starting to have feelings for you, but if you’re just doing this out of survival again…”\n\nYou stare him directly in his eyes.\n\n“Yes, Roger. I mean it. Not just for me, but for you. I don’t want you to put yourself in any danger anymore than I want myself to be in danger. And Fort Timons is just going to be unnecessary danger. I know we haven’t known each other long, but we have been through a lot together and if this is the way this shitty world is going to be, then I want to at least spend the rest of that time with you.”\n\nWell if you didn’t mean any of that, it sure was enough to convince Roger because he resumes kissing and hugging you immediately. Of course you did mean it since you have grown attached to him. Just a sucker for men who save your life you guess.\n\nYou both don’t even notice Henry walking up to you.\n\n“Hrm, looks like I interrupted something. So did you two decide on what you’re going to do…besides suck on each others faces?” he asks.\n“Well…” Roger says and then smiles at you before turning his attention to Henry. “I think we’ll be staying.”\n“Great. Glad to hear it. Need more people to help defend this place. Think you could help with look out for awhile with that rifle of yours?” Henry says.\n“Sure. For how long?” Roger asks.\n“Hmm, probably until midnight. Earl needs to get some sleep, that’s why he’s so irritable right now. As for you little lady, why don’t you head on inside and get acquainted with everyone. You and your boyfriend can pick up where you left off later.”\n\nHenry goes to wander over to Earl to give him the news that he’ll be relieved soon and you and Roger are left alone again.\n\n“Okay, well I guess I’ll see you later tonight then.” Roger says.\n“Yes, though I wonder where we’re supposed to sleep.” You answer.\n“Well presumably together now.”\n“Ha ha, of course but that wasn’t what I meant.”\n“Hrm, I’m sure someone will tell you inside what the sleeping arrangements are, well anyway I probably should get over to my new job. See you later.” Roger says.\n\nAs he leaves, you shout to him to be careful which he just smiles and waves as a reassurance that you don’t need to worry about him.\n\nAnd now you turn towards the truck stop building which no longer has the small crowd outside it anymore and people have gone back inside. People which you now have to be social with…\n\n“Okay, Suzy. You can do this. It won’t be like the carnival.” You mumble to yourself as you walk to the building.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you see a mixture of people. Mostly older men, but women as well and even a couple children. Most of them look up when you enter.\n\n“Hi everyone. I’m Suzy and my boyfriend Roger are going to be staying here, but we brought in a whole bunch of medical supplies and food with us to help pull our weight around here.”\n\nYour introduction is met with apathy. Half of them grunt in acknowledgement and the other half just go back to doing whatever it is they were doing.\n\nWell it’s better than most of what you got at the carnival.\n\nSeeing that nobody is speaking to you, you decide to sit quietly by yourself in a booth far away from everyone else. You mainly spend your time in introspection and listening to the random conversations. Most of them naturally are talking about the situation at hand, but it’s broken up by periods of “normalcy” of just joking around.\n\nNobody here seems to be overly worried about rabid people running around and the breaking down of society, then again most of the people here are truckers so they’re probably used to roaming about and the employees of the place seem like they spend so much time here it’s a second home.\n\nEventually enough time passes and you get tired of being a wall flower, or more specifically you’re tired of wearing the same clothes for the past few days along with no shower. You walk up to the group of waitresses in the hopes to ask them that perhaps there is some sort of wash up facility here.\n\nThe oldest waitress, a red head with hard features and a name tag that says Anne looks you up and down as you approach and her friends do likewise.\n\n“Excuse me, but is there a wash room or shower or something I could use? I just feel so dirty what with the sweating and running from those things outside.”\n\nYou expect catty remarks or a few insults or some sort of hostility, but you’re met with a surprise.\n\n“Why sure blondie. You can use the small shower we have for us in the back. You need a change of clothes too?” Anne says.\n“You have some?”\n“Well they’re extra waitress uniforms. If that’s okay.”\n“Sure, if it’s clean it’ll be a welcome change.”\n“Okay, hmm you’re a bit on the small side, Jasmine, go get Trudy’s old uniform. That should fit…Suzy wasn’t it?”\n“Yes, and thank you.”\n\nSoon, Jasmine returns to give you a uniform and you’re on your way to get washed up. The waitresses’ private bathroom isn’t much but the fact it has a shower that you can use to get clean is enough for you.\n\nYou feel a little odd wearing the uniform, which was obviously designed to attract a lot of male attention, but again you’re just glad to be out of those old dirty clothes.\n\nBy the time you get out of the shower, the waitresses are cooking up dinner for everyone. You ask if they need any help, but they say they got it.\n\nYou sit down and eat, a couple people make a bit of small talk, but nothing of importance. You mostly are left alone, but it’s a promising start at least. In any event the re-invigorated feeling you had after the shower is wearing off and you start to get tired which is when you ask Anne where the sleeping area is.\n\n“Well some people are flopping right out here in these booths. A few really brave souls are sleeping out in their trucks out there. Henry’s got his own private office as you might expect. The wait staff has that small lounge area near our bathroom…though Jasmine is using one of the storerooms since she’s got her kids with her. I guess you could take one these booths or share the storeroom with Jasmine. Of course you’ve got that boyfriend…hmmm could give you the second storeroom. Doesn’t really have a lot of space though.”\n“That’s fine, I just want some where to rest.”\n\nAnd once again you succeed in a simple task with no major problems. Things have been going so well for you since you got here that you almost forget about the problems of the outside world going on. You don’t of course, but you honestly can say this is the safest you’ve felt since you left your basement.\n\nGiving you a spare blanket, Anne directs you to the second storeroom, which is indeed lacking in space but it’s enough for you. You waste no time in laying down your blanket and falling asleep on the floor.\n",
  "page 25": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“…this was a paid announcement by the Ground Zero Corporation…”\n\n“Agh! Shut the fuck up already. What the hell did GZ buy up all the goddamn stations?!” you hear Roger shout as he angrily turns the radio off, waking you up.\n\nIt would seem you’re in motion again and you slept through it.\n\n“What’s going on?” you ask.\n“Huh? Oh you’re up. Nothing’s going on, just dumb ass Ground Zero commercials warning about an impending nuclear holocaust as usual. Never mind the fact we got a very real threat that I can’t seem to get any information on. Anyway I didn’t sleep that much so I just started driving again. Figured you could still sleep though so I didn’t bother waking you” Roger says.\n“So how long have we been on the road?”\n“More than a few hours definitely. Starting to by pass all this farmland area now, we’ll probably be hitting a more populated area soon. I also started to see a few more moving vehicles, though I’ve also been seeing a lot of abandoned vehicles as well. Oddly no military. Saw a few people even trying to hitch a ride, but I’m not playing good Samaritan right now.”\n“You see any of those things?” you ask.\n“Hrm, I thought I might’ve seen a few while I was driving, but from the distance I could quite tell. Wasn’t like I was going to check.”\n\nSo far it looks like the plan is still going to Fort Timons, but if you didn’t think that was a dubious idea before, you’re really uncertain now. He can’t get any signal from the radio, for all you know the base might be overrun by those things. Which is exactly what you bring up to Roger, but he seems confident that wouldn’t be the case and he’s determined to head to Fort Timons. Funny thing considering he abandoned all his comrades at the carnival and said they were all assholes. Guess he’s still military at heart.\n\nHe senses that you still aren’t comfortable with his plan though.\n\n“Suzy, you don’t need to come with me you know. I mean I can drop you off at the next town we go through.” Roger says.\n“And what exactly am I going to do there? I don’t have anything except the clothes on my back and with the way things are going, I can imagine I’d be resorting to taking those off a lot just to survive.” You say.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence before Roger replies.\n\n“I’m guessing that’s what you were doing with me back at the carnival. It’s fine, I sort of knew that’s what was going on. I knew you didn’t actually like me.”\n“If you knew all that, why did you risk your career and possibly your life?”\n“You’re kidding right? I mean I know I’m not hideous, but you’re a little out of my league. When the hell am I going to get a chance to be with someone that looks like you? I mean sure I knew it was all an act, but in MY mind I could pretend you were being genuine. Though I admit when you stopped me from kissing you and didn’t want to look at my face, that sort of hurt.”\n“It wasn’t personal. I just don’t know you that well and I wasn’t ready for that level of intimacy. I was going to pretend you were my ex-boyfriend. (Sigh) I can’t believe I even went that far and was going to go through with it. I mean contrary to whatever you may have heard shouted at me, I don’t do stuff like that like…ever.”\n“Really? Because you’re pretty good at the whole seduction thing, even if you are a bit obvious with it.”\n“I’m obvious with it because it’s only just a new skill I developed within the last few days I joined a goddamn carnival just to get out of my goddamn shitty life at home…What the hell was I even thinking?! I’m not cut out to take care of myself! I should’ve just stayed home and let cannibals eat me in the comfort of my basement!” you say, tearing up a bit. The stress of the week is starting to get to you.\n\n“Whoa! You don’t mean that. Things aren’t totally horrible. Hey if it make you feel any better, I felt a little bad knowing that I was going to take advantage of what was obviously the act of a desperate woman.” Roger says.\n\nNow you stop sniffling and start to chuckle at the absurdity of that statement.\n\n“But of course that wasn’t going to stop you.” You say.\n“Well no of course not, but I assure you I would’ve felt guilty about it.”\n“No you wouldn’t have.”\n“Okay you’re right, I wouldn’t have, but I would have still gotten you out of that carnival if you had asked afterwards.”\n“Well at least it wouldn’t have been for nothing. (Sigh) Guess it all worked out anyway. I mean we’re both still alive due to our choices and I am thankful I’m not dead and that you probably saved my life back there.”\n“And I’m thankful I at least got to see you naked.”\n“We’ll always have the trailer I suppose.”\n\nYou don’t exactly feel good about your situation, but Roger’s attempt to lighten up the mood at least has you feeling slightly better.\n\n“So…why don’t you tell me about this ex-boyfriend of yours? I’m guessing he must’ve been some sort of handsome stud if you’re still thinking about him.” Roger says.\n“Heh. Not especially. He was a normal looking guy. Not too much different from you in that department. He’s just the only guy I’ve ever been with, so, it was more comfortable to think about him instead. Anyway it was sort of complicated with him. Long story that I don’t want to get into right now.”\n“I understand. Well I’ll just say this, he was lucky to have you as a girlfriend and was a damn fool to let you get away.”\n“Hrm…actually you know what? You’re exactly right. He WAS lucky to have me and a damn fool to let me get away!” you say with a bit of pride.\n\nYou know Roger is half saying this just in the hopes to get you into a compromising position again, but what the hell, it’s an ego booster and it keeps you in a positive mindset at least.\n\n“Shit.” Roger suddenly says.\n“What now?” you ask.\n“I just looked at the gas gauge, we’re practically out. Goddamn it I thought Ernie gassed this thing up recently.”\n“We can’t make it to Timons?”\n“Well we could risk it on fumes to Fort Timons, but I’d rather not chance that during these circumstances. I don’t even have a rubber hose that we could use to suck out the gas from one these abandoned vehicles we’ve been passing.”\n“Well I guess we’re stopping at the next gas station then.”\n“Assuming they got any. I get the impression just popping into the next gas station isn’t going to be that simple.”\n\nYou and Roger continue to drive for about a half hour before you see something of interest in the distance. Namely a truck stop, which apparently has been converted into a minor fortress.\n\n“Hey look at that!” you point out.\n“I see it. It’s a truck stop and it looks like whoever is there is trying to block the place off by putting trucks around it. They even got people standing on top of the trucks with rifles as look outs. They probably got gas.” Roger says.\n“I dunno. Whoever is there probably isn’t going to be too trustful of anyone, especially someone from the military. They might just try to rob us.”\n“We gotta try. I mean we need gas, and given how well this place is defended, we at least know they probably got some. Who knows if we’ll get lucky some place else.”\n\nYou and Roger drive to the truck stop, which immediately causes the lookouts to point and raise their rifles in your direction. When you stop in front of it there are a lot of shouts for you to stay in the truck.\n\n“We don’t need any government assistance here, we’re doing just fine as you can see. I highly suggest that y’all just continue on your way.” One of them shouts.\n“I’m not here for trouble. I just need some gas. We get that and we’ll be on our way to Fort Timons.” Roger shouts back.\n“Gas? Don’t fucking think so soldier boy. With the way society is collapsing that shit’s gonna be valuable and money is gonna be worthless.”\n“Well, would you accept a trade of supplies for gas?”\n“Hrmmm, well whatta you got?”\n“Got some military rations in the back of this thing. Those things last for years you know.”\n“We got tons of food, what else? Any weapons?”\n“Uh…there might be a couple…oh we got some medical supplies in here!”\n\nThere is a long pause and he tells you to wait before climbing down the truck and disappearing from sight. Eventually you hear his voice again which is now coming from behind the truck barricade.\n\n“Okay, we’re gonna move this truck, but one funny thing happens and you’re the first one getting a bullet to the head. Alright, we’re letting this one in, everyone keep extra look out for those rabid bastards!”\n\n“You still think this is a good idea?” you ask.\n“Well it’s like I said, our options for gas are limited.” Roger answers.\n\nAs soon as the truck is moved out your way, the man who was barking orders at you waves you in and motions you over to the gas pumps. As soon as you drive in they put the truck back. Either they’re really safety conscience or they don’t want to risk having you get away.\n\nFrom this distance you see several more people in the building part of the truck stop. Looks like it’s a general store/diner combo. Most of them are watching you from the windows, though a few of them come out, one of them is an older man with a cane who walks directly to the pumps.\n\n“Okay, I want the two you in that truck to exit it slowly. I don’t care if you got weapons, but don’t point them at me or anyone else in a threatening manner.” The old man shouts.\n\nRoger takes his rifle over his shoulder and exits the truck. You do like wise, though being unarmed you exit from Roger’s side just so you don’t feel quite as vulnerable. Naturally rifles are pointed at the pair of you, but the old man with the cane shouts telling them to calm down.\n\n“You lot, stop pointing your guns and start unloading this truck. Sorry about that, everyone’s a little on edge. Name’s Henry. I own this place.” He says.\n“Roger and it’s understandable.”\n“Well, a military man eh? Thought all the National Guard were off fighting those rabid things in the city. From what I’ve heard the place is completely overrun now.”\n“The city? You mean Security is overrun?” you ask.\n“Yep. Heard it on the radio. Not the regular one of course. Those GZ bastards seem to be clogging those up, but on my Ham Radio. Been trying to communicate with Fort Timons, but my radio isn’t exactly in the best condition…”\n“Hold on! You’ve been in communication with Fort Timons?!” Roger exclaims.\n“Well, somewhat. More like my old buddy I served with back in the day who still works there as an inventory clerk. Haven’t heard anything from him since yesterday. All I know is the last thing he told me was the fort was on high alert and further communication was going to be limited to a need to know basis and only to those with the proper clearance. Typical military bullshit I suppose, well I don’t need to tell you.”\n“Uh, we were on our way to Fort Timons. Do you think it’s safe?” You say.\n“Heh, well I couldn’t tell you if the fort is safe, but I can tell you that those rabid fuckers have been making their way out of the city en mass and given how far the city is, they apparently don’t get tired and can cover a lot of ground. We just repelled a bunch of them yesterday. Hence the make shift fortress here. Fort Timons is even closer to the city, so at best I’d wager that you’re going to have to wade through a bunch of those things before getting there. Not something I’d want to do to be sure.” Henry remarks.\n“Shit, those things are in the city and they were in my town! This means this can’t just be a local thing! It’s probably a nationwide epidemic! We can’t go to Fort Timons now!” you exclaim.\n“We don’t know if the place has fallen to those things.” Roger replies.\n“Exactly! We don’t know!” you say.\n\nAt this point Henry interjects.\n\n“If I may, the both of you can stay here. We’ve got the room and your truck full of supplies as far as I’m concerned buys your way in. And I’m sure as a military man, you’d pull your weight here to defend this place if need be. So you and your girlfriend can stay here if you wish.” Henry says and then walks over to oversee his people unloading the truck.\n\nIt’s an incredibly tempting offer and one you’d jump at the chance for, but Roger still seems sure that Fort Timons will better in the long run. You wonder if he feels a little obligated to go back to Fort Timons because deep down he feels like he abandoned his post even if hasn’t admitted it.\n\nThe only downside is if Roger doesn’t stick around and you do, you’ll be left in the company of a bunch of strangers again and that didn’t go so well last time. You can only imagine all the leers, grope attempts and possibly worse from a bunch of horny trucker types.\n",
  "page 28": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a body grinding up against you, an arm holding you tightly around your mid-section and warm breath blowing in your ear in between the kissing.\n\nNot exactly what you expected, but it beats those Ground Zero advertisements.\n\n“Wha the…Roger that better be you.” You say.\n“Of course its me. Who else would it be? Bobby?” Roger answers.\n“Well I couldn’t tell, your erection pressing into me feels to be about the same size.”\n“Wow… way to make a guy feel special.” Roger says.\n“Oh don’t be sensitive, I could’ve said it was smaller. Anyway, isn’t there some sort of protocol against this in the barracks?” you say turning you head.\n“Pfft, protocol isn’t what it used to be. If you haven’t noticed there isn’t even anyone using this one, except you and barring an assault on this place, the captain was good enough to give me a day to rest up before going back on duty full time. Higgins always was cool about things, glad he’s in charge now.”\n“Hmm, so what’s going on?” you ask.\n“Nothing important, just holding out until we re-establish contact with the government I guess. Higgins might be cool about certain things, but he said he really couldn’t give out any more information other than the infected humans are not going to be a threat to us as long as we stay in the base. All the units that were sent out into the city were long since asked to pull back here though obviously not a lot made it back and there has been no contact with any of the units sent to your town.”\n“Shit.” You say.\n“Yeah, guess we both got really lucky. I spoke with some of the guys and a lot are still shaken up about stuff that went down in the city. It’s times like this that make you really glad to be alive.”\n“Yeah, I guess we are survivors.” You say and for a moment you lie with Roger finally feeling totally safe from the horrors that are occurring outside right now. You haven’t felt this way since you left your basement.\n\nYour moment is then broken by Roger resuming his groping and kissing on you.\n\n“Mmm, you smell so good right now…” Roger says.\n“Smell good? I haven’t had a proper shower in days! Nevermind the fact I’ve been running and sweating in the same clothes. I’m disgusting, I’d ask how you’re even getting turned on by me right now, but I probably do smell like roses compared to you.” You say.\n“Well, come on let’s go use the shower together.”\n“…NOW? I mean those things are open, what if someone walks in on us?”\n“Nobody will. I told you, there isn’t even anyone here in this area. Besides we can make it quick.”\n“Quick. Just what every girl wants to hear…(snort) don’t you think this is all a little presumptuous of you anyway? I said I liked and felt close to you, when did I say I was going to fuck you?”\n“When I helped you escape.” Roger says continuing to kiss on you.\n“Oh, that’s low…” you chuckle. “So is this more about me owing you something? Is that the way you want it?”\n“Hey, I’ll take it.”\n“Fuck it, I was tired of playing hard to get anyway. It’s been several days since I’ve even managed to pleasure myself so I’m about due. Come on let’s go hit the showers.” You say and get off the bed.\n\nYou and Roger go to the nearby shower room. The pair of you are stripping your clothes off on your way there. By the time you’ve turned on the water, the both of you are naked.\n\nYou enjoy both the force of the cleansing water hitting the front of your body as well as the force of Roger hitting your girl parts from the back. One of his hands starts to grope your breasts while his other remains gripped at your side.\n\nEvery thrust feels like a great release from the stress you’ve endured this week. You scream out in ecstasy for more and you don’t give a shit how loud you are and who might hear you. You just hope Roger’s got that military stamina to go the distance.\n\nYou don’t know how much time passes because you’re enjoying yourself so much and then you feel it.\n\n“Oh my God! I’m almost there! Keep doing that! Harder! Faster! Oh yessss…” you exclaim and then the explosion.\n\nNamely the nuclear bomb that explodes over the base.\n\nWhether this seemingly insignificant military base was a legitimate target or a misalignment from hitting the city of Security (Which probably still got hit too) is irrelevant.\n\nWho launched the nuke is irrelevant.\n\nWhy it was launched is irrelevant.\n\nWhat is relevant is that you, Roger and many others with the large radius of this blast are instantly vaporized.\n\nAt least you went out with a bang.\n",
  "page 27": "While you probably could talk Roger into staying if you turned on the charm again, you’ve done enough of that for quite some time and honestly he might be right as far as safety is concerned.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the people here, this truck stop is still open enough that those things could get in. (Crawl under the trucks for one thing) Also while the owner seems cool, you don’t know everyone else and the last time you encountered a cool owner was the carnival and you know how that turned out. You also imagine that a military base might indeed survive an extended siege a lot better than this place.\n\n“Suzy, I still think going to Timons is a better idea than staying here. I’m going, so if you want to stay…” Roger says before you interrupt him.\n“No, I’ll go with you.”\n“But I thought you thought it was a bad idea.”\n“Well, I still sort of do, but I guess if this is a major crisis and the end of civilization, I’d rather be with you. So if you believe we’ll be safe there, then I believe we’ll be safe there.”\n\nRoger smiles at that remark. He immediately goes to hug you, which you weren’t quite expecting, but you hug back. You suppose you are getting attached to him. Just a sucker for men who save your life you guess.\n\nAfter this happy experience Roger goes over to gas up the truck and you wait nearby. You don’t even notice Henry come up to you.\n\n“So you two decide on what to do yet?”\n“Huh? Oh, yeah we’re going to try to make it to Timons.”\n“Hm. Well I wish you luck on that. Too bad you’re not staying though, could use a few more people to guard this place and help out around here.”\n“Yeah, well I wish we were staying too, but well he wants to go to Fort Timons so that means we’re both going.”\n“Heh, well love for another always has a way of making you act out of character.”\n“Y…eah something like that I guess.” You say reluctantly. Henry still hasn’t caught on that you aren’t really “with” Roger, but you don’t bother correcting him.\n“Don’t worry, you got this big truck, so you should be safe as long as you don’t get out of the thing or stop for a long period of time to let those things swarm you. And despite my doom and gloom earlier, don’t take that as truth. I mean what do I know. I’m stuck here with a Ham Radio that I can barely get to work right at the best of times. Things might not be as bad as they seem. Who knows? Maybe this will all be over in a day or two.”\n“Heh, one can only hope.” You say.\n“Remember though, if Timons doesn’t work out, you’re welcome to come back here.”\n“Thanks Henry that’s very generous of you.”\n\nAfter your short talk with Henry, Roger is ready to get going again and you’ve got the fuel to get to your destination.\n\n“We left you those MREs and the water. No need to leave you without the basics. Anyway, like I told your pretty girlfriend here, I wish you luck and if it doesn’t work out, you’re welcome to come back here.” Henry tells Roger\n“Thank you and we’ll keep that in mind.” Roger replies and drives off towards the “truck gate” which is now opening up.\n\nAnd with that you’re on the road again.\n\n“Hey I just want you to know, I’m really glad you’re coming with me. I mean I know you didn’t want to and…look I think you know I really like you and it’s not just because you flirted with me and I saw you naked and all that. I really enjoy your company. Probably not the best time to be addressing all this shit, but I think its better I just tell you where I stand right now. Especially with everything that’s going on. Anyway that’s all I want to say and I’ll drop the subject.” Roger says.\n\nYou’re having a déjà vu moment like when Klepto admitted all his feelings for you, though with Roger it feels a little different. You get a little more sincerity with him. Klepto was always a little too sycophantic as far you were concerned.\n\nHell, maybe you didn’t just decide to go off with Roger out of survival. Here or even back at the carnival. Maybe somewhere you did have an attraction to him and you just denied it for some reason. It’s that damn “good girl” trait you never shook off from your mother drilling it into your head when you were growing up.\n\n“I…I like and feel close to you too Roger.” You say and smile back at Roger.\n\nWith this acknowledgement of your feelings for each other, a good period of your drive is in silence, but not an awkward silence, a comfortable one.\n\nThe silence isn’t just going on in the truck, it’s also going on outside or least relatively speaking. Despite what Henry said, so far you haven’t encountered any hordes of those rabid things and you’re driving through suburbs by this point. You also haven’t seen many people walking about, but you assume most people are taking shelter somewhere.\n\nHappily the streets aren’t clogged with abandoned vehicles. That was one thing that Roger was more worried about. A line of vehicles is a little harder to drive over even with a big truck.\n\nNight comes and the rabid are a little bit more active though nothing that can’t be handled. Most of the time Roger just drives past them and they give chase for a while, but sometimes he runs them over.\n\n“Sheesh, they are getting thicker. Glad we don’t actually have to go INTO Security. Pftt, Security. Now that’s an ironic name for the city. Anyway we should actually get to Fort Timons around two or three in the morning.” Roger says.\n“Glad to hear it. I’m getting tired, but I’m too on edge to sleep.” You say.\n“Eh, go ahead and close your eyes at least. I’ll try to keep the zombie smashing to a minimum.”\n“They aren’t zombies, I think we established that they’re living right?”\n‘Yeah, pretty sure they’re all alive, just rabid. Or whatever is wrong with them. Dunno if they infect anyone though, don’t want to ever find that out.”\n“I agree.” You reply and then try to take Roger’s advice by closing your eyes.\n\nYou don’t really sleep so much as you rest and sort of drift in and out. You aren’t fully awake again until Roger calls your attention to your destination which isn’t far now.\n\n“Ha ha! Suzy wake up! We’re here! We made it and look they even got the towers lit up! The fort still stands!” he exclaims in joy.\n“Huh, yeah. That’s really…” before you can finish your groggy words Roger has stopped the truck, grabbed you and kisses you full on the lips. You’re too tired to resist, though you wouldn’t have bother anyway.\n\n“Well was it everything you expected?” you ask after he’s done.\n“Even better!” Roger says and then tries to kiss you again.\n“Whoa, hold on there, let’s save the victory kissing until AFTER we get in this place. I mean how do we even know they’ll let us in?”\n“Oh we’ll get in, I know we will.” Roger says and starts up the truck again.\n\nYou get within range and suddenly spotlights move in your direction and a loud speaker calls out for you slow your speed to a crawl and to stop at the gates and to prepare to be inspected. Roger complies and soon you’re sitting before the gates of Fort Timons.\n\nYou can imagine snipers from the towers are pointing their weapons on you and when the gates open a whole damn squad of soldiers comes out. A young man with glasses comes up to the driver’s side.\n\n“Riley? Is that you? Holy shit, we thought your squad was dead.”\n“It’s me Keller and I’m the only survivor. You’ll never believe what the hell happened.”\n\n“Riley?” you think, but then you realize that must be his last name. In fact it’s right on his shirt. Funny how you never noticed before. Never noticed he was a corporal either.\n\n“Well there’s been a lot going on here too, so probably won’t be too surprised. Anyway Captain Higgins will want to see you. Uh, he’s in charge now.” Keller says.\n“Shit, I guess a lot has changed.”\n“Yeah, who’s this in your passenger side?”\n“This is Suzy. She actually saved my life out there. Don’t worry she’s not bit or infected or anything.”\n“Guess you never had to suffer it first hand, but if you’re referring to those rabid, they don’t infect you if they bite. One good thing about all this I suppose. Saved your life eh? How’d that happen?”\n“Oh I got something surprised when I first encountered one of those things and it was on top of me snarling and growling. Suzy here got a knife and stabbed it in the face. Just enough for me to put it down permanently with a few rounds to its head and body.”\n“I’m also his girlfriend!” you add, hoping that by having a closer tie to Roger that they’ll let you in.\n“Girlfriend? Hrm. I guess stressful situations really do cause close bonds. Well under normal circumstances we wouldn’t let a civvie in that isn’t blood related or your spouse, but I guess we can make an exception. All right come on in. Don’t want to risk having this gate open any longer than it needs to be.”\n\nAs you drive in you at last feel safer than you have been in a long while. Roger and you both exit the vehicle and Roger tells you that some people will probably take you to the barracks or some place with a bed. He says he’ll meet up with you later as he has to go report in.\n\n“Okay, I’ll see you then.” You say and you move in to kiss him goodbye.\n\nWell if you weren’t his girlfriend before, you certainly cemented it now.\n\nYou are escorted to a barracks area just as Roger said you would be, but it’s mostly empty. The two soldiers that escort you mention that most of people stationed here never came back after being sent to the city, so there’s a lot of room now. They don’t say much else and soon leave you to your own devices.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time during this hellish week, you’re alone. It’s almost a bit scary, but in a way you’ve missed it. You’re too tired though to really appreciate it and you collapse on one of the beds and start to drift off…\n",
  "page 20": "While you hope you don’t have to go too far, if it means getting the hell out of this place, then maybe that’s what you’ll have to do because whether the National Guard leaves or stays the fact remains, you’re not the one to lead this carnival like Roofie thinks you are and you feel your life is in danger.\n\nYou start to walk over to Roger.\n\n“Hey where are you going?” Klepto asks.\n“Not sure yet, but don’t wait up.” You reply and continue walking to Roger.\n\nWhen you get to Roger you’re all smiles, poses and charm.\n\n“Hello Roger are you doing well today?” You say in a friendly tone.\n“Hey, Suzy. I’m okay I guess, but I really wish your friends wouldn’t cause so much trouble. Somebody is libel to get hurt. My commanding officer isn’t exactly the tolerant type and I think you saw that earlier.”\n“Yes, I did. I was so scared. In fact I’m scared of the whole aura this place is giving now. It’s becoming very violent, but I feel so much safer being near you.” You say and start to touch Roger.\n\nAt this point Roger is smiling back at you, but his buddy nearby is a little less approving, though you imagine its jealousy more than anything else.\n\n“Roger, we’re supposed to be keeping an eye on these carnie freaks, not fraternizing with them.”\n“What’s the harm Ernie? I mean she says she’s scared. What, you think she’s going to clobber me in the head and take my weapon? Come on, stop being so paranoid. We shouldn’t even be here anyway.”\n“Orders are orders…ugh. Whatever, I’m not going to watch you make goo goo eyes at some carnie whore. I’ll be outside this tent, try to keep your eyes on the detainees and not on her ass the whole time.” Ernie says and steps outside the tent.\n\n“What a rude person. I’m glad you’re not like that.” You say now with your arms wrapped around Roger.\n“Well you know, I treat people the way they want to be treated.” Roger replies.\n\nAs distracted as Roger is, he’s actually keeping it together better than one would think. He keeps a tight grip on his rifle and an eye on if you’re going to attempt to grab his pistol. He also periodically looks away from you to make sure nobody is taking advantage of this situation. (Which Klepto and the rest look like they were going to do, but realize they’re still too far away to rush at Roger before he could shove you aside and open fire)\n\nThough your plan wasn’t necessarily to save everyone, but rather yourself.\n\n“So Roger, what’s a girl gotta do to get out of here?” you say seductively.\n“Well, like I said we should be gone later today or tomorrow at the latest.”\n“Too long and anything could happen within that time! Can’t you do something? I mean I could make it worth your while.” You say and run your finger across Roger’s chest.\n“Suzy, look, I’d really like to help, but…hey!” Roger is interrupted when you grab his hand.\n\nYou bring his hand to your face and closing your eyes, you insert his index finger in your mouth and slowly suck on it making “mmmmm” sounds.\n\nThis scene hasn’t gone unnoticed by more than a few carnies watching you. In fact the predictable calls of “whore”, “slut” and worse are uttered your way.\n\nRoger on the other hand is practically speechless.\n\n“I…uh…shit…” he says and then pulls his hand away staring at his finger for a moment.\n“Awww….but I wasn’t done sucking on you…” you say and flutter your eyes a bit, trying to look as cute as possible then you whisper in his ear:\n\n“Take me back to my trailer and I’ll show you the REAL greatest show on earth.” then you lick his ear.\n\nRoger immediately calls in Ernie loudly. Ernie rushes in with his weapon ready to kill something.\n\n“What?! What?! Are they rioting again?!” he exclaims.\n“No. But I REALLY need a favor! You need to watch these people and if the commander checks in on us, tell him I had a to take a shit really bad.”\n“What…wait… Oh fuck no! You’re gonna go fuck this little carnie whore aren’t you? Goddamnit Roger!”\n“Come on Ernie, you can’t help me out?”\n“Motherfucker, I’m always helping you out! I don’t understand why you can’t just fuck the bitch right here. Not like these people are shy and from the looks of her, she looks like it wouldn’t be the first time she’s gotten fucked in front of a live audience.” Ernie remarks.\n\nYou know, while you’ve gotten used to the baseless comments about you being a woman of loose morals, it still hurts sometimes.\n\nIn any case, Roger is not a man to be deterred from his lust for you right now.\n\n“Alright, fine. I didn’t want to hold this over your head, but you leave me no choice…” Roger starts to say, but whatever the threat is, Ernie doesn’t even let him finish it.\n“Oh fuck. (Sigh) Don’t even say it. Fine. Go. Go. Go! And don’t take too long, though I imagine in your case that won’t be a problem.” Ernie says defeated.\n“Thanks man! Seriously I really will remember this favor!”\n“Hrm. That you only got through blackmail.”\n\nAs you and Roger leave, Ernie says one more thing.\n\n“Hope you’ve got condoms, because lord knows what diseases she’s got being a carnie. Her kootch might turn your dick into a fucking Siamese Twin or some shit.”\n\n“How the hell does that even make sense? Fucking asshole…” you say and start to get angry at Ernie’s comments, but Roger just take you by the hand to go back to your trailer.\n“Don’t mind him. Let’ hurry though, because we don’t want to bump into anyone else. It isn’t like I got leverage over everyone like I do with Ernie. So where is your trailer?”\n\nYou tell him the location and the pair of you are heading over in that direction fluctuating between being “stealthy” and running.\n\nWhile you’re doing this, it occurs to you that you have to think up your next move. Are you really going to let him fuck you? Roger is distracted enough that you probably could grab his side arm to give you enough time to make a run for it, but while Roger might not shoot you immediately (And that’s rolling dice there) there’s nothing to say the other nearby Guardsmen won’t and you know they’ll be alerted as soon as you try to run away from Roger.\n\nOf course if you really are willing to make that ultimate “sacrifice” for freedom, Roger might even help you out a lot more in your escape attempt. Of course he could turn out to be a complete asshole and march you back to the tent after he’s had his way with you.\n",
  "page 200": "This is the man you’ve chosen to marry for better or worse. If you aren’t going to help him in a matter of life or death then that wouldn’t say much for your commitment.\n\nBesides, if he gets killed this whole compound is going to turn to shit and you’d no doubt be at the bottom of it, assuming Aaron doesn’t kill you all first.\n\n“Helen, you go see to the young ones, I’m going to stand by Bobby.”\n“But…”\n“It’s my choice, I’ll be fine! Now go!”\n\nHelen is a little unsure, but complies with your wishes.\n\n“Be careful, Suzy.” Helen says and leaves.\n\nYou rush outside towards Bobby who is still taking cover behind a car and firing upon the Aaron. He sees you out the corner of his eye while still keeping an eye on the direction of the truck.\n\n“Keep your head down, I think Aaron escaped out the passenger door of the truck and is hiding behind Brandon’s car now. Where the hell did you come from anyway? I told Helen to go get you and the younger children to a safer location when Aaron showed up.” Bobby exclaims.\n“Yeah well I’m showing you that I’m not just going to let you do this shit alone. I’m with you all the way. No hiding with Helen and the kids, no matter what you say.”\n\nYou’re interrupted by gunfire on your position and Aaron ranting.\n\n“You think you can stop what’s coming by hiding? Hah! People are already fucking EATING each other out there! Shit, I’ll be doing you a favor by killing you now. Actually now that I think about… your blonde bitch looks like a fine piece of ass in more way than one!” Aaron shouts and starts laughing maniacally and then throws another grenade your way.\n\nYou and Bobby have no choice but to leave your position and make a dash back to the house entrance. It’s somewhat of a minor miracle that you and Bobby aren’t hit by any of the bullets he fires at you. You manage to get inside just as the grenade goes off and adds to the total of destroyed vehicles outside.\n\nYou and Bobby are on the floor though Bobby has partially managed to cover you with his own body.\n\n“What the hell did he do, rip off the entire National Guard armory?” you say as Bobby back kicks the front door shut from his prone position.\n“I don’t know but…”\n\nTwo more explosions are heard on the left side of compound. Aaron is apparently throwing explosives through the windows now.\n\n“Shit, I hope nobody ran and hid over there.” You remark as the pair of you start to get up off the floor.\n“Where the fuck IS everyone anyway? Nice to know I can REALLY count on these fuckers when the going gets tough. Why the fuck am I even bothering again? Fuck!” Bobby yells in frustration.\n\nYou understand his anger, but it’s probably not the best time for a rant.\n\n“Bobby, calm yourself. You can yell at those idiots later, but right now all that matters is that I’m here helping you okay?” you say.\n“Yeah…okay. Just wish we had more reliable help. (Sigh) To think, the only thing I was concerned about was exiling Diana today.”\n“Okay, so what’s the game plan?” you ask slightly disappointed that Bobby’s decision was to exile Diana rather than death, but you aren’t entirely surprised. Still, there’s always the hope that Aaron does kill her.\n\nBobby quickly snaps back to the situation at hand.\n\n“Well it sounds like he’s stopped with the explosives, or maybe he’s just fishing out more. I’d say the safest bet is to get to the second floor and shoot him through one of the windows. No point in going back out the front door when we can get the vantage point.”\n“How do we know he’s still outside, he might’ve already entered house through one of the holes he’s undoubtedly made with his grenades.” You say.\n“He could try for the armory, though he’s still gotta come through this way if he wants to go there. Given his state of mind though he might also try to do something like run upstairs and kill all the children for fun. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past him to try to access the prisoner’s dungeon and set them all free. It is on the left wing after all. (Sigh) As much as I hate splitting up, I’m going to need you to stay here and guard the foyer just in case he tries to sneak through here.” Bobby says.\n“I really think I should come with you. Splitting up is always a bad idea in these situations.”\n“I don’t like it either, but it’s a big house and we need to cast a wide net to deal with this asshole.” Bobby says.\n“Okay Bobby, I’ll stay here, but please be careful.” You remark.\n\"I\u0027ll be fine, you just keep a look out and remember, if you see him, don\u0027t talk, just shoot. Oh and if any of my cousins ever come out of hiding and pass through here, tell them to fucking help you.\" Bobby says and then kisses you before heading to the left wing of the house.\n\nSoon after Bobby leaves, you put your back against one of the walls and start keeping an eye on the doorways.\n\nMinutes pass and you start to get a little nervous. Not a lot, but enough that you move from your spot and check the left doorway.\n\nThen you briefly hear the sounds of rushing footsteps behind you and you don’t even get to completely turn around before you feel a crushing blow to the side of your head.\n\nYou crumple to the floor on your knees and then another blow to your head causes you to collapse flat on the floor and lose grip of your pistol. A pair of blurry hands quickly grabs it from you.\n\n“You and that traitorous bitch of a sister of mine think you can take Bobby after he exiles me? I heard the pair of you conspiring together yesterday in her room after Bobby ripped my heart out. Fucking cunt.” Diana says and points it at you.\n\nYou weakly attempt to grab at Diana who kicks you in the face, your already bleeding head hits the floor.\n\n“Normally, I’d savor this moment. Maybe even keep you alive longer to enjoy torturing you a bit more, but I think under the circumstances, putting you down now is the more efficient plan. Haven’t decided if I should help Bobby yet…or perhaps even Aaron…guess I’ll surprise them both.”\n\nDespite Diana aiming for your head and being at this close range she manages to completely fuck up her shot and hit you in the throat instead which doesn’t kill you instantly.\n\n“Shit, well I guess it’s good my aim isn’t that great, I got to see you suffer a little more after all. Say hello to my sister in fucking traitor’s hell. I will be laughing at you both within Tiamat’s glorious chaos!” Diana shouts as you gurgle, choke and finally die.\n",
  "page 201": "Getting into a fistfight with Diana is one thing, but you’re definitely not up to dealing with this crazy asshole. You just hope Bobby is up for dealing with him though apparently Helen thinks so.\n\n“Come on! Bobby can handle this, but we need to get to the children where it’s safe!” Helen exclaims and you start to follow her.\n\nThe pair of you run upstairs away from the sounds of shouting and gunfire. You soon reach the top and follow Helen through a corridor doorway.\n\nAnd then Helen nearly gets bashed in the head with a bat when she passes through an entryway. She does take a hit to the shoulder though which causes her to fall to the floor in pain. Diana steps out from the corner she was hiding behind and then rushes at you.\n\nYou’re caught off guard and point your pistol at Diana, and actually manage to fire a shot, but unfortunately Diana’s smashes your arm with the bat away from her direction so your shot goes wild. Hardly matters since between the kickback of the pistol and the pain you end up dropping the gun entirely.\n\nWith you unarmed and Helen still clutching her arm in pain, Diana’s head swivels back and forth rapidly, to make sure neither one of you are going to suddenly lunge at her, though she’s also eyeing the dropped pistol too.\n\n“After Bobby ripped my heart out I went upstairs to my room and overheard you two bitches conspiring against me. Didn’t know you had it in you Helen. I always knew you loved Bobby, but always figured you’d be too weak to do shit about it. Guess that’s my fault for showing you mercy.” Diana remarks.\n\nWhile Diana’s ranting to her sister, you attempt to make a play for the gun, but Diana swings her bat at you, nearly hitting you in the face. You step back just in time.\n\n“And you. You certainly have proved yourself the stereotype of dumb blonde, because if you actually bought that bullshit that my sister fed you, you’re stupider than I thought you were. You actually think she’s gonna just let you have Bobby? She’s gonna backstab you the same way she backstabbed me.”\n“Maybe she backstabbed you because you were a fucking bully to her, you ever think of that?” you say.\n“Bully? She oughta be grateful I didn’t kill her ass and instead made her strong enough for her to grow a spine to betray me in the first place! Hey! Where the fuck you goin’?” Diana remarks when she turns her head to see Helen getting up to run away.\n\nDiana throws her bat at Helen’s legs, which successfully hit and trip her up. Diana then goes for the pistol and that’s when you pounce and manage to tackle her. The pair of you are soon rolling on the floor again, punching, scratching and kneeing each other.\n\nYou both try to go for the pistol on several occasions, but neither of you gets the advantage, in fact when Diana finally does, you knock it out of her hand and it goes sprawling and down the stairs to the first floor.\n\n“Bah! I don’t need a gun to do my work anyhow! I’ll enjoy it even more killing you with my bare hands!” Diana remarks and lands a good punch on you and then she slams the back of your head into the floor causing you to become a little dazed. She’d do more, but then Helen comes up from behind her with the bat in hand.\n\nUnfortunately for Helen, Diana hears Helen and catches Helen’s feeble swing and stops the bat from actually hitting her.\n\n“I’m gonna so enjoy hurting you little sister…” Diana exclaims and attempts to rip the bat from Helen’s hand. Helen’s grip is strong enough that Diana doesn’t succeed so instead Diana uses Helen’s weight against her and pushes the bat towards Helen as hard as she can. Helen, not expecting this, loses her footing on her already bruised legs and falls back on the nearby wall, dropping the bat entirely, which rolls away.\n\nDiana gets off of you, to take care of her sister who at this point is begging to not be hurt.\n\n“Diana, please…this isn’t my fault…Bobby chose Su…” Diana squeaks.\n“BOBBY CHOSE ME FIRST! BOBBY IS MINE! HE’S ALWAYS BEEN MINE BY BIRTH! You fucking little weakling traitorous bitch! Had you just stayed in line, I might’ve even been kind enough to let Bobby face fuck you on your birthday, but the only fucking you’re going to get now is in your ass because I’m going knee deep in it!”\n\nAt this point Helen squeals in fear and curls up in a tight ball while Diana starts kicking the hell out of her. Meanwhile you’re starting to come around a bit more. Things are still a bit dizzy for you and you’re a bit wobbly standing up, but you manage it.\n\nYou attempt to make a run (or fast paced wobble at any rate) for the bat, but Diana stops you before you can even reach it.\n\n“Don’t think so bottled blonde bitch!” Diana says and knocks you to the floor and then follows up with a kick.\n\nDiana gets on top of you and while you struggle to fight her off, she slaps away your attempts and wraps her hands around your throat.\n\n“You are going to very dark place and I’m going to enjoy putting you there.” She remarks and then she starts doing some weird chanting, similar to the shit Bobby says at times when you’re having sex with him, but this isn’t nearly as fun.\n\nYou try to pry her hands off your throat, but her grip is like iron. You start to lose consciousness.\n\nYou try one more time to get her off of you by punching her in the face, but your swing isn’t strong enough and Diana is just too determined to end your life.\n\nDiana’s face gets blurry, you choke and then everything goes black.\n\nEverything is black for what probably seems to be forever. There is nothing. No fluffy cloud heaven, no lake of fire, and definitely not any Tiamat.\n\nThen you feel a sensation around your mouth and the sensation of air going in. It’s pleasant enough that you instinctively throw your arms out to embrace Bobby. When you open your eyes you find Helen’s face lip locked to yours.\n\nAfter a few seconds you actually freak out about it being her instead of Bobby.\n\n“H…hey! What the hell?!” you say and push Helen off of you.\n“I’m sorry Suzy, but you were unconscious and I was resuscitating you.” Helen remarks.\n“I wasn’t breathing?” you ask.\n“Um, well it didn’t look like you were. I mean Diana choked you out before I got to her.”\n“Wait, I was just unconscious. (cough) You didn’t check to see if I was still breathing first? You just wrapped your (cough) lips around mine and started blowing into my mouth?”\n“I panicked and didn’t want to waste time checking! I didn’t want you to die!” Helen exclaims.\n\nWell you can’t really fault her for trying to save your life.\n\n“(Cough) Well thanks Helen. So where is Diana?” you ask rubbing your throat which still hurts like hell.\n“Over to your right.” Helen points out and sure enough you turn your head and see Diana laying face down on the floor.\n“I smacked her in the head with the bat when she was choking you. I dunno if I killed her. I didn’t check to see if she was still breathing either, I was too busy worrying about you. Are you sure you’re feeling okay?”\n“Yeah, I’m fine.” You slowly starting to stand. It takes some effort, but Helen helps you up. Your whole body hurts.\n\nYou stare at Diana’s body and see her chest briefly rise and fall, so it looks like she’s still alive, just unconscious. Though you’re severely tempted to put an end to that, but you’ve got a better idea.\n\n“You think Bobby would let me sacrifice Diana?” you ask which takes her a little by surprise.\n“Um…I don’t know. I mean after we explain what she did, I can’t see he’d have any objections. There are no rules against it.” Helen replies.\n“Good, it’s my fucking wedding day, I should at least get to pick…well shit looks like she’s waking up already.” You remark when you see Diana begin to stir.\n\n“Hey, guess what Diana, you’re going to be at my wedding after all. You’re going to be one of the most important people there in fact. Helen, do you have anything to tie this bitch up with?” you ask.\n“Uh, yeah I think I know where there are some handcuffs and there’s always duct tape laying around somewhere.” Helen replies.\n“Well go get them. I’ll keep an eye on Diana.” You say and pick up the nearby bat.\n\nWhile Helen goes running off, you standby staring at Diana who is giving you the stare of death, but is obviously still in lady pain.\n\n“You think I’m gonna just let you throw me on the altar and shove a knife in me like some fucking sheep? You gotta another thing coming blondie.” She remarks.\n“I don’t see as you have really a choice at this point.” You remark.\n“Bullshit, I still got a few choices. Like for instance, I could rush you right now, take that bat from you and bash your brains in with it.”\n“You think you still got the strength for that, let alone the speed?”\n“Maybe I’ll make it, maybe I won’t, but we’re gonna see…” Diana says and spits blood from her mouth.\n\nJust as you’re about to put out Diana’s lights again, you suddenly hear a very loud explosion which sounds like it’s coming from the left side of the house. You’ve been so busy with Diana, you’ve completely forgotten that Bobby’s been battling it out with Aaron elsewhere in the house. Your concerns are briefly for him instead.\n\nHowever, with this very brief distraction, Diana takes advantage and lunges at you and the pair of you are struggling with the damn bat again.\n\nDiana seems to be fueled by some sort of unnatural rage at this point, because she’s certainly more formidable than the first time you fought with her in the dining room, or maybe she’s not underestimating you like she did last time. In any case, you need an advantage, which is either going to be the bat you’re currently still struggling with, or the gun which you know is still somewhere on the stairwell.\n",
  "page 204": "Obviously all this rolling on the floor and hand to hand shit isn’t getting you anywhere with her. She’s tougher than you thought and you need to just shoot her and put an end to this.\n\nAs hard as you can, you do the same trick Diana did to Helen and use her weight against her and shove her as hard as you can while letting go of the bat. Diana ends up falling on her ass and you turn to run towards the stairs.\n\nYou get half way down the stairs when you feel a hard smack against your lower back when Diana throws the bat at you, causing you to lose your balance and you take a full tumble down the stairs. Not only do you break your arm in the process, you also end up hitting your head hard on the steps several times to the point where you’ve probably got a concussion, but that’s the least of your concerns.\n\nDizzy and moaning in pain from your arm. You’re in no condition to fight Diana when she hovers over you with the gun you were trying to get in hand.\n\n“Y’know, under ideal circumstances, I’d take my time with you and enjoy dishing out the pain over the course of days, but I suppose I’ll just have to do that with my sister instead. Tiamat truly blesses the strong, all hail her glorious chaos!” Diana says and blasts you several times.\n",
  "page 203": "You don’t have time to go hunting for a gun when Diana’s already at your throat. Besides, if you shoot her, you risk killing her and you’ve still got that plan to sacrifice her ass.\n\nDiana’s grip and pull on the bat begins loosening your on grip on it. She’s going to have it soon, but since she’s so focused on the upper body, she’s not really paying attention to her lower defenses.\n\nYou let go of the bat, which causes her to fall backwards slightly. Not enough to fall, but enough to put her a bit off balance and back up from you. Within this brief window of relief you follow up with your next attack and as hard as you can you kick her RIGHT IN THE PUSSY.\n\nDiana’s grip on the bat fails and you’re quick to retrieve it while she’s grabbing her girl parts in agony.\n\n“And I don’t dye my hair, I’m a fucking natural blonde, you fucking bitch!” you say and smash Diana’s nose in with the pommel of the bat. She falls to the floor bellowing in pain.\n\nMeanwhile Diana’s finally returned with the duct tape as well as a pair of handcuffs.\n\n“Shit, what happened?” Helen asks.\n“She attacked me again, what the fuck do you think happened? Come on let’s tie this bitch up, I just heard an explosion in the house and I want to go help Bobby.”\n\nYou and Helen waste no time in handcuffing Diana’s hands behind her back and then duct taping her ankles together to the point where the bottom part of her legs look like a mummy. Of course when she won’t stop swearing and cursing at you both, you duct tape her mouth shut as well.\n\n“Okay, she should be secure. I’m going to grab that gun that’s probably somewhere still on the stairs and check on Bobby. Here, you take this and keep an eye on that bitch.” You say to Helen and hand her the bat.\n“Okay, please be careful Suzy.” Helen remarks and you’re off.\n\nOn your way down the stairs you find the pistol that was dropped and take it. Then when you get to the ground floor you start cautiously making your way to the left wing of the house. You still haven’t seen anyone yet.\n\nThe smell of gunpowder and smoke is in the air of this part of the house and peering in one of the rooms you see the results of what you assume is from grenades. The room is charred, blackened and wrecked. Whatever items were in this room have been completely destroyed and there is now a large hole allowing direct entry from the outside to the inside.\n\nYou also notice small splotches of blood on the floor causing an easier to follow trail. Though who’s blood it is you have no idea. You can only hope it’s Aaron’s.\n\n“Shit, I really hope you’re alright Bobby.” You say to yourself and begin to follow the trail.\n\nYou pass through a series of rooms to get to your destination. Some furnished, some empty. Eventually you get to a small room that has a door leading to stairs going down. You wonder if this is the dungeon that was mentioned to you in passing before.\n\nWhile you’re a little reluctant to go down there, this is where the blood trail leads. The smell emanating from that direction isn’t pleasant though it sounds silent down there. You slowly walk down the steps.\n\nThe closer you get to the bottom, the smell becomes worse and when you finally get to the bottom there is no mistaking that this is indeed the dungeon, but it’s a complete wreck.\n\nThere are body parts, gore and blood all over the place. A few of the cages you see are destroyed and at the farthest wall there is a large chunk taken out of it. Apparently there was more explosive fun down here.\n\nAnd sitting close to one of the more intact cages on a sturdy looking chair is Bobby looking down at the floor. Most of his clothing is covered blood and looks a bit dejected, but doesn’t look hurt so that’s good at least.\n\n“Bobby? Bobby are you okay?” you ask causing him to look up.\n“Oh yes, I’m fine…what happened to you?” Bobby says and starts getting up.\n\nYou didn’t think about how you might look after coming back from your tussle with Diana. You’re probably sporting a few cuts and bruises of your own.\n\n“Oh, I had a knock down drag out with your sister Diana. Tried to kill me and Helen this time. We took care of it though.”\n“She dead?”\n“No, but I decided if I have to sacrifice someone on my wedding day, I’m requesting…no I’m demanding that it be her. So we’ve got her tied up for that purpose.”\n\nBobby doesn’t respond in too much surprise at your request.\n\n“Well, I think after everything you’ve gone through, I think you deserve that right. It’s just as well anyway considering Aaron’s crazy ass just blew up all the prisoners.” Bobby says with a sigh.\n“What’s wrong? Didn’t we win and everything has worked out?” you ask.\n“Yeah, it did…it’s just…I dunno. I guess some of Aaron’s ranting just got to me that’s all.”\n“Well what did he say?”\n“Oh he just kept accusing me of not really being dedicated to Tiamat. I dunno, I know I shouldn’t pay any attention to it, but I can’t help but think he might have had a point. Maybe I am a little caught up in ritual…but still I THINK it’s important to revere Tiamat in a formal way! Just because I’m not completely running amok stealing army trucks and throwing explosives at shit doesn’t make me any less dedicated to glorious chaos! I mean…does it?”\n\nAnd that’s your cue to support the fragile male ego again.\n\n“Well of course it doesn’t my love. Your way is obviously a more intelligent approach to chaos. Just because something is chaotic, doesn’t mean it’s mindless. You’re playing the long game and attempting to build a dynasty. Instead of burning out quick, you’re plotting and planning labyrinthian schemes to eventually burn them all.” You say while looking into Bobby’s eyes and stroking the side of his face.\n“I’m so glad you understand me.” Bobby remarks and hugs you tightly.\n\nBobby really does always feel completely better with just a few supportive words from you. Its sort of amazing really since you didn’t realize you had this sort of power over him, then again you two were never really in a situation like this before except the first time you met and that was when you counted on him to “rescue you.” That dynamic has clearly changed. You guess this is what his grandmother meant when she spoke to you in the dream.\n\nWith that settled, Bobby and you make your way back to where Helen and Diana are. When you arrive, you see several other family members who finally came out of hiding.\n\n“Bobby you’re alive! I’m so glad to see you’re safe!” Helen remarks.\n\nBobby just nods acknowledging Helen, but then turns his attention to everyone as a group.\n\n“Helen, you go check on the kids, if you haven’t already and YOU four, I’m gonna have another long talk with, but we’re going to do that later. Right now, Brandon, Ronald you grab Diana and throw her in one of those cells in the dungeon. There’s a couple of good ones still left. Afterwards, all of you are going to help me clean up this place…shit there is so much to do.”\n\nBobby tells you not to worry about doing anything as you did enough just having to deal with Diana and he wants you to just rest up for tomorrow. You offer to help, but he really won’t hear of it. You don’t press the issue since hey if he doesn’t want you doing any work, you’re not going to argue about that. Before you leave he tells you that he’s got a spare gun in his clothing drawer just in case of an emergency.\n\nBefore you head to your room, you grab a quick meal since you realize you didn’t really eat yesterday. By the time you get to your room, you’re really glad you didn’t have to help Bobby, because you’re really starting to feel the aches and pain all over your body. You take another shower, which helps a little.\n\nYou spend the remainder of the day and night in the bedroom just resting. You hear noise occasionally from downstairs. At one point you hear the sound of vehicles outside and looking out the window you see someone driving the damaged army truck in front of where Aaron crashed through the gate as a temporary barrier you guess.\n\nEventually you hear a knock on the door. You ask who it is and it’s Helen. You tell her to come in.\n\n“Hey Suzy, I just came in to check on you. Are you feeling okay?” Helen asks.\n“Well my body hurts all over, but other than that, I’m fine. You?” You ask.\n“Oh, I’m a little sore too, but nothing to worry about.”\n“Hm, so how’s the clean up going?”\n“Oh, I suspect that will be going on through the night.”\n“Well I guess Bobby won’t be coming to bed tonight then.” You remark.\n\nThen Helen walks towards the bed closer and asks:\n\n“Did…did you want me to get into bed with you? I mean I know it’s not the same but...”\n\nYou’re almost at a loss for words.\n\n“Excuse me? I just meant he won’t be coming to bed, I wasn’t even implying anything sexual, and why are you offering to get into bed with me?! Y’know Helen, you’ve been putting out some strange signals towards me a couple times these past few days and at this point I’m starting to think you’re attracted to me…”\n\nHelen’s face turns a little pale and she attempts to turn to run away.\n\n“Helen, stop! I wanna know what’s going on in that head of yours, so come back.” You demand and sit up as Helen slowly walks back over.\n\n“I’m…sorry Suzy…I just thought…I dunno…you liked me…” Helen says looking down.\n“I do like you, but…wait, so you don’t love Bobby anymore?” you ask.\n“I do…but I feel like we’ve been so close these past two days, I think I’m starting to fall for you too. I mean when our lips were touching I felt a closer connection to you than I ever had before.”\n“You were giving me mouth to mouth resuscitation!” you shout.\n“But you embraced me in your arms! You even slipped your tongue in my mouth and when you opened your eyes you didn’t even let go immediately…” Helen points out.\n“I…I… was out of it! I thought you were Bobby!” you exclaim.\n“Bobby kisses like me?” Helen asks.\n“No, you tasted sweeter…I mean…fuck…Gah! Look I thought you were Bobby okay?”\n“Okay…I’m sorry Suzy. I didn’t mean to offend you.”\n“I’m not offended, this is just…weird though. I’m not a lesbian, not to mention I’m going to marry your brother. (Sigh) Look Helen, I’m a little tired to deal with this right now. I think we might have to address this in more detail tomorrow.”\n“But the wedding is tomorrow.”\n“Well, I guess that will be one more thing to deal with then, so until then good night. And before you even ask, no I won’t tell Bobby about this. I’m sure he’s got enough on his mind.” You say.\n“Thank you Suzy.” Helen says and then slowly walks out of your room.\n\nAfter she leaves you rub your face in disbelief of how this day has ended. This whole week has felt so random that you feel like you’re in one of those choose your own adventure books, you can’t even imagine how tomorrow is going to go.\n\nThe only upside is unless this is some really elaborate seduction plot, Helen’s not planning to kill you like you thought she might be.\n\nThen again, who the hell ever knows in this house?\n\nAs you start to fall asleep, you can imagine Grandma Morningstar is going to have a field day with this one.\n",
  "page 206": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\"And now Suzy, having beaten the chicken soup out of all her other opponents this week, will take this final challenge by herself! Will she be able to do it ladies and gentlemen? Will she be able to impress Misty at last? We’ll find out today! Let’s give our small town girl some encouragement for her task at hand!”\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at…\n\nA huge plate of tacos, fish tacos to be precise. The lack of subtlety is hardly surprising at this point.\n\nYou double face palm before exhaling and looking up.\n\n“Really?” you ask in disbelief.\n“This is the last task Suzy…” the disembodied announcer’s voice whispers.\n“I don’t give a shit, the concept of fish tacos is fucking disgusting for one thing and for another…”\n\nSuddenly Bobby’s grandmother appears as she has been doing in your dreams.\n\n“See? Told you we should’ve just went with traditional beef. Anyway I think the point was made.” Bobby’s grandmother cackles and with a wave of her cane, you’re back in that blasted wasteland you were in last time.\n\n“And what point would that be? And am I meeting this Misty yet or what?”\n“No, you’re not meeting Misty yet, and as for the point I think we both know what point that was.”\n“Yeah and I’m not a lesbian.” You say.\n“Who said you were? It’s pretty clear you love the cock, but you’re in some serious denial if you’re standing here claiming that you’re not into girls as well. It’s okay, really. There are no lines, we’re all here to enjoy each other’s bodies.”\n“I’m not!” you protest.\n“Oh come on Suzy, you know deep down you’re curious. Some of that three way porn on your computer involves the two girls and a guy configuration. I’d say beyond curious at this point. We both know you find Helen cute because you’re a narcissist at heart and she reminds you of yourself in some ways. Nothing like self love.”\n“Well she does have pretty eyes… but I’m still not interested. She’s a girl and I just don’t swing that way.” you say.\n“Bullshit, are you seriously saying you wouldn’t like to put a strap on and do my grand daughter from behind? Pull her hair and make her say your name and then after you were done fucking her, you’d shove her face in your pussy until she licked it clean and you climaxed in her mouth?”\n\nYou’re not sure what’s more disturbing. A dead old lady giving graphic descriptions of how you’d fuck her grand daughter, or the fact that it’s sort of turning you on a bit.\n\nYou’re a little at loss for words.\n\n“Hey…hey two girls and one guy isn’t lesbian porn.” You say fumbling with a partial defense.\n“Oh? I see. So it’s not gay if it’s a three-way? Well whatever you have to tell yourself I suppose. Still, if you truly feel that way I’m wondering if you’d be open to…nah…”\n“What?” you ask wondering where she’s going with this.\n“Hah! You ARE curious!” Grandma Morningstar cackles.\n“I’m not! I’m just wondering what you were going to drone on about!”\n\n“Okay then here it is, besides being really into getting blowjobs, Bobby’s also really into girl on girl stuff. Bobby probably wouldn’t turn down the idea of having a second wife which would be Helen in this instance. This wouldn’t have worked before with Diana, because of how much you two hated each other. However, with Helen, I think this would be more workable…” Grandma Morningstar says.\n“What? He’s never told me this! He’s never even gave any indication!” you say.\n“Well of course he hasn’t, as I told you before he’s a bit too much a gentleman to suggest it and I’m fairly certain he’s never even felt any romantic feelings towards Helen either. However I know for certain if you approached him with the idea, that he damn sure wouldn’t be against it.”\n“Well I’D be fucking against it!” you say.\n“Wait, so you’re fine with murdering someone on your wedding day, but you’re against marrying two people. You’re fine with being associated with a bunch of murderers that practice incest, but you’re against having sex with another girl even one you find attractive even if you don’t want to admit it. Interesting set of moral values you’ve got there blondie.”\n“But I’m marrying into YOUR family! Isn’t that a little hypocritical to criticize me when you’ve probably engaged in all manner of illegal and unnatural acts yourself?”\n“Not at all. My point is I didn’t really have the same arbitrary limits you place on yourself. I’m just pointing out your odd inconsistencies. I suppose it’s not really your fault. You can’t help the puritanical way you were raised.”\n\nYou’re getting a little agitated and getting tired of insane troll logic at this point.\n\n“Look, if all you’re going to do is insult me, I think I’d like to wake up now.” You say.\n“You will soon, in any case I’m just trying to help YOU out!”\n“How is sharing Bobby helping me out?”\n“Sheesh, first you still can’t figure out who Misty is, now this? You really are slow on the uptake ain’t ya blondie? You’re lucky you’re pretty.” Bobby’s grandmother asks and then taps you in the forehead with her hand.\n“Ow! Stop!” you say and back away.\n“Look, I’m just going to end with this sagely wisdom. If you really want to live in a harmonious household, I suggest you open your mind a little. You’ve already made a few steps in the right direction; you might as well go all the way. I mean who the hell is going to be judging you? Nobody important that’s for sure. Besides, I’m sure with a little forethought you can think of the benefits of such an arrangement and turn it into an advantage. Well, that’s what I think. Anyway, congrats on your wedding and you’ve got my blessing. Good luck!”\n\nGood luck? Somehow that doesn’t sound reassuring. You’re about to ask Bobby’s grandmother what she exactly means by that, but then she waves that damn cane again and you’re enveloped the blackness and then you wake up.\n\n“Gah, fucking bitch.” You say groggily.\n“Oh...I’m sorry for waking you…I just wanted to apologize for yesterday and give you this to see if it fits, but I understand if you don’t want me here…” a familiar female voice remarks.\n\nYou look around the room and see Helen coming in carrying some red clothing.\n\n“Huh? No, not you…wait what are you doing in here anyway? Did Bobby spend all night working on the house?” you ask\n“I’m bringing in your wedding dress and yes, Bobby has been working on the house for the most part. Trying to patch up the big hole in the house, cleaning up the dungeon, blocking the front gate. He had to bury our brother Jordan as well. I don’t believe he’s actually slept yet.”\n“Oh yeah, forgot that that asshole killed one of your siblings. I didn’t know him that well, but sorry for your loss.” You remark.\n“Thank you, but I suppose we’re all just puppets in Tiamat’s glourious chaos, so we all need to just move on right? We have to accept that some things just will never be…anyway could you see if this fits?” Helen asks holding up the red clothing which now looks a lot like lingerie.\n“Wait, that’s the wedding dress? It looks like slutty underwear from Hot Secret.” You answer and get out of bed.\n\nHelen’s face looks a bit offended by that statement.\n\n“My grandmother wore this on her wedding day! She had this dress made of the finest silk, not whatever cheap material they use in North Tiwanaland or some place! THIS is a one of a kind article of clothing! It’s not something you’d find in some edgy teenager hang out!” Helen remarks.\n“Okay! Geez. I’m not trying to insult the dress or your grandmother. It’s just…well I thought I’d be wearing something a little more… substantial. But seeing as your family isn’t exactly conventional and when in Rome…I guess I better try it on. Um, you washed it right?”\n“Of course. Hand washed it myself. Can’t risk putting it in a machine.” Helen says and hands it to you.\n“Red fishnets…red high heels…” you say.\n“Yes. Those shoes were also special made with the finest…”\n“Leather. Yes, I can imagine. Let me guess the fishnets were made with the finest silk as well.”\n“Well of course, what else would it be?”\n“What else indeed. Okay, well I guess I’m going in the bathroom to change.”\n“I understand. I’m still sorry about making you uncomfortable about my unwanted advances.” Helen says.\n\nBefore you enter the bathroom, you start to wonder…\n\n“Helen, why did you approach me? Or rather I know why, but you were attracted to Bobby long before you met me. You obviously have the inner strength to make the first move as it were.”\n“Well, that was a little different for several reasons. I mean Diana would’ve killed me had I actually made a move on Bobby! With you, I just…I dunno. The moment felt right? And it still wasn’t easy. Of course I misread signals. Sorry.” Helen remarks meekly.\n\nAnd there it is, Helen’s subservience in action. Even with Diana gone, Helen’s mindset hasn’t changed much. You’re just a “nicer” replacement to Diana. You’re fairly certain now that Helen means no harm to you, if indeed she ever really did.\n\nSo this is it, you’ll marry Bobby, have children by him and live happily ever as queen in this twisted family. Helen as usual will play the second fiddle content with her lot in life. As strange as that seems all relatively good for you, you still can’t help but think Helen doesn’t deserve better in some way. She did directly save your life after all.\n\nIt makes you start to ponder Grandma Morningstar’s words of opening one’s mind to make way for new possibilities…\n",
  "page 33": "With all the gunfire going on outside, you don’t exactly feel as if that would be any safer. Better help Billy for now.\n\nYou all approach the massive brawl, but none of you save for Lifto has any real desire or ability to fight. Shrimpy finds a place to hide and occasionally throws something at someone, Klepto gets knocked out by one of Phil’s crew and its only with the help of Lifto that he doesn’t get his face stomped in. Fatty does a little better due to his size, but he’s not much in the endurance area and has to stop to catch his breath every few minutes (which results in someone inevitably trying to attack him)\n\nYou try to stay out of it and maintain a close distance to either the dwarves or Lifto. You occasionally point out potential dangers and sometimes even manage to club someone in the head with a juggling pin you found on the ground, but you’re nowhere near in the thick of it.\n\nWhile all this is going on, you notice a decrease in the gunfire from outside and a lot more screaming and groaning. Through the chaos you see Roger staggering just outside the tent and collapsing near the entrance of it. Seeing that you’re not really affecting the “power struggle” you rush over to Roger to see what the hell happened out side the tent.\n\nWhen you get to Roger, you notice he’s badly wounded and bleeding a lot. You don’t know if he’s going to make it.\n\n“Roger! What the hell…what happened?!”\n“(Gasp) They…just…came out of nowhere…(gasp) a bunch of them.”\n“What?! What came out?” you ask.\n“I dunno. Ugggh…hurts…(gasp) they were insane looking…snarling, biting…”\n\nYou notice that most of Roger’s wounds do look like bite marks. You can’t believe that you’re even pondering this, but…\n“Shit, Roger, are you telling me you just got attacked by…fucking zombies?”\n\nAt this point Roger doesn’t respond he’s falling unconscious and his breathing is getting short. You attempt to sit him up and smack him awake, but nothing is working. He’s going to die and if your vast knowledge of zombie movies is any indication he’s going to soon become on as well.\n\nThat’s the least of your concerns however since while you’re holding on to Roger, one the “zombies” that Roger alluded to suddenly comes out from behind one of the parked military vehicles. It doesn’t see you immediately, but it will if you hang around out here.\n\nStanding up and backing away from Roger’s soon to be lifeless body and trying to get back in the tent, you bump into another equally unpleasant individual and no less dangerous. Her face is bloody and several of her piercings have been pulled out, but if she’s out here that can only mean she won.\n\n“There you are, clown bitch. I was hoping to get the pleasure to beat your blonde ass myself, too bad Wanda the Red caught a knife to the throat because it might’ve been fun to watch her anally rape you with her twelve inch strap on before I kicked the shit out of you.” Razor remarks.\n“Razor, there are zom…there are some insane people that just…” you start to say and then Razor punches you across the face, knocking you to the ground.\n\nWhile you’re holding the side of your face, Razor pulls out a bloody straight razor.\n\n“Don’t worry, I don’t plan on killing you, I just plan on making you the first in our brand new freakshow!” Razor says and is about to get on top of you to carry out her promise, but all your survival instincts kick in and you scream and kick at her. If she were a man, you would’ve gotten in a couple good ball kicks. Eventually she grabs one of your legs with one arm.\n\n“Good! Struggle bitch, this is just making it more fun for me. Ain’t nobody gonna save you anyway. Everyone else is licking their wounds or dead! The carnival is under my control now!”\n“I wasn’t screaming for someone in carnival to save me.” You say.\n\nRazor is confused by your remark only because she’s been so focused on doing harm to you that she’s completely ignored her surroundings. Not only did the zombie hear your scream, but so did several of his fellows and unfortunately for Razor they’re the fast variety.\n\nThe one that was near the military vehicle is already upon Razor by the time she does look up and two more are loping quickly behind. You quickly scramble into the tent hoping that the dead that Razor mentioned inside aren’t turning and this is a “bite style” infection.\n\nRazor wasn’t kidding when she mentioned people either being wounded or dead. Granted there are more than a few people in fair condition, but resting from the past brawl is more of a priority right now. Too bad for them that isn’t an option.\n\n“Oh god! Hel… AGGGGGH!”\n\n“You hear that? That’s the sound of your short-lived leader getting ripped to shreds by cannibal freaks. So if you idiots are done killing each other over power, you better get ready to kill for survival!” you shout and grab the nearest blunt object as you hear the screams of Razor being presumably eaten alive outside.\n\nNo sooner have you grabbed a piece of chair leg, one of the zombies rushes in. You manage to bash it once across the head and then again before it goes down. It grabs at your feet and you’re about to smash your improvised club on it, when Shrimpy suddenly has run up and done it for you with a juggling pin. You both at that point keep hitting the thing until its brains are mush and it isn’t moving anymore.\n\n“(Whew) Thanks Shrimpy. Glad to see you survived.”\n“You as well, what the hell are…”\n“Later, Shrimp. Concentrate!” you say as the other two zombies come lurching in. Fortunately at this point you and Shrimpy get a little more back up from some of the other carnies and luckily nobody else gets hurt.\n\nAfter killing the pair of them, you’re suddenly bombarded by questions about what the hell they are. The only thing you can think of is zombies, but after a bit of cautious investigation by some of you, you start to wonder if that’s even accurate.\n\nYou come to several fortunate conclusions and discoveries.\n\nFirst of all it looks like there aren’t anymore of those things alive anymore and the National Guard are all dead as well. So those dangers are out of the way.\n\nSecond, nobody dead has come back to life, (bitten or not) so at least this isn’t contagious whatever it is. In fact you see one of the “zombies” laying dead with several bullet wounds to the chest and no head wound, so you don’t think these things are undead at least. But the fact that you’ve got crazed cannibal people running loose is still cause for concern!\n\nAs you, Shrimpy and several others continue to cautiously investigate outside the tent, Shrimpy mentions some bad news while you two are away from the group. Namely Lifto, Fatty, Billy and Roofie were all dead, though you mention you already knew about Roofie.\n\n“Yeah, the old guy died peacefully in his sleep I guess. Probably best that he did just before what happened. So what about Klepto?” you ask.\n“Oh he’s still alive. He’s still unconscious, from that first hit, but he’s still alive. Hey, I meant to say I’m sorry about being so self-serving like I was, before all this went down Suzy. I guess I just got scared.”\n“Well…it’s in the past now. Besides you came through for me when I really needed it. So you said Billy’s dead?”\n“Yeah, that bitch Razor got him just as he was finishing off Wanda the Red. As you might expect the remaining dwarves are pretty broken up about it. But then I guess Razor’s dead too, so I’m not sure where that leaves us.”\n“A possible opportunity I’d say. Looks like the National Guard left a lot of supplies that could be useful in the near future. Come on let’s head back.” You say and pick up one of the rifles. Laying on the ground nearby.\n\nWhen you get back to the tent, people haven’t moved much from their original positions though the medical supplies taken from one of the military trucks should help patch up the wounded.\n\nYou stand in front of everyone and give a speech. You know it probably won’t go over well, but this is as good of time as any.\n\n“Okay people as a great man who recently passed away once said, a carnival can be like a family. Now we’ve just gotten over a major in house feud and an external threat and guess what, we’re all still here and alive to talk about it. That means we can move on and grow stronger from this because I get the impression that we’re REALLY going to need to have that unbreakable bond of family in the near future. A strong family also needs a strong leader and that’s why seeing as I’m currently the only one more or less in good physical condition at this time, I nominate myself as ringmaster.”\n\nYou expect some verbal outbursts at this point, but everyone is still too exhausted or unwilling to get into more conflict, but you are getting a lot of frowning looks.\n\n“Now I already know what you’re thinking, this bitch hasn’t been here but for a few days so who does she think she is telling us all what to do? Well let’s answer that. You’re right, I’m new here, but I know A LOT about dysfunctional families. And every dysfunctional family ALSO needs a scapegoat to place the blame on. Now as ringmaster all the major decisions and such would fall to me and as such if I fuck up severely, well who gets the blame? Me of course. It’s my hope of course that as a leader I can change everyone’s perspective of me through successes. However, most of the females here already hate me based solely on how I look, and most of you guys just see me as a living sex doll, so really what have you got to lose? If it turns out that I’m a total failure as a leader then you all can easily throw me out on my ass and choose someone else.”\n\nNobody says anything. Just an awkward pause, which you decide to fill in with more talking.\n\n“And if someone is worried that one group is going to get preferential treatment like say the clowns well you can stop worrying since most of them are currently dead and I’m probably going to be too busy with being ring master than clowning.”\n\n“Fuck it, let the cute clown slut run this place. Her mouth looks like it’s a highway for oral sex, but she can’t be any worse than what that mean ass cunt Razor had planned. At least she’s got a positive attitude.” Some dwarf woman says in the back holding a bloody rag over her forehead.\n\nAnd with that “sterling” endorsement several others just agree as well.\n\nLooks like you’re the new leader of this carnival and all it took was a complete bloodbath and the apathy of the survivors to do it.\n\nThe remainder of the night is spent building a small barricade around the big tent and clearing out the dead. Nobody knows if more of those geeks (Which is the new name for the “zombies” and appropriate considering the history of what a carnival geek does for a living) are going to show up and where they came from so for safety reasons everyone stays close for the night. Some are in no condition to move anyway.\n\nEventually you fall asleep realizing that tomorrow is going to be a busy day for you.\n",
  "page 208": "You have to admit you HAVE always been a bit curious, and this probably would be the easiest way to satisfy that curiosity.\n\n“Fuck it.” You say to yourself, throw your “wedding dress” aside and you turn around and approach Helen.\n\n“Take off all your clothes.” You say.\n“Wha…what?” Helen remarks in surprise.\n“Take off all your clothes. Obviously we got some things to work out before we proceed any further, or more specifically I got some things to work out before I proceed any further. So get your clothes off.” You say and head over to the bed where you start taking off your own.\n\nThis is uncharted territory for you, but strangely as you lie in bed completely naked, you’re not quite as nervous about it as you thought you might be. When Helen finally gets naked, you see she has nice little body on her. Her tits aren’t as big as yours, but nobody’s perfect.\n\nAs mildly anxious as you are, Helen has to be doubly so. She might’ve made the “first move” but you’ve definitely taken the lead. Helen’s also a virgin for all intents and purposes. You wonder if that might be making all this a little hotter for you.\n\n“You’re very beautiful.” Helen says walking over to you.\n“Yeah…oh you’re not bad yourself. So…you ready to do this?” you ask.\n“Yes, I’m ready…um…I’ve never done this before with anyone…how should we start?” Helen asks.\n“Uh, I guess kissing. Even in the movies they usually start like that.” You reply.\n“Okay.” Helen remarks compliantly.\n\nHelen lies next to you and the pair of you begin kissing and caressing each other. It’s definitely different than when you’re with Bobby who tends to be a little rougher. This really isn’t all that bad; in fact the only downside is Helen is doing a lot of talking instead of focusing on the task at hand. It’s not even dirty talk; she keeps asking questions if she’s doing something right. Doesn’t take you long before you start pushing her head down so she can stop talking altogether.\n\n“Oh…okay…” Helen remarks as she gets the hint.\n“And Helen, I don’t want any more talking. Just focus, understand? Yeah…mmm…just like that…” you say as you feel the magic starting to happen.\n\nYour back starts arching, your toes start curling, you begin to make moans of pleasure and grab the back of Helen’s head. You’re generally in a state of bliss as Helen does her thing. At this moment nothing else exists except your pleasure so you aren’t paying any attention to the noise that is going on outside.\n\nAnd you aren’t paying attention to the door when it opens up…\n\n“Urgh! What the fuck are you two doing?!” Veronica exclaims with a gun in her hand.\n“Oh! Um…uh…” Helen stutters as she wipes her mouth and raises her head up and probably looking like a deer in the headlights from Veronica’s perspective.\n“SHIT! Doesn’t anyone fucking knock!? What the hell are you doing in here waving a gun around?” you say and try to cover up as much as you can.\n\n“I was coming to warn you that we’re being fucking attacked by zombies! I didn’t realize I was going to walk in on you two dyking it out! Does Bobby know about this?” Veronica says.\n“Nevermind all that, did you just say zombies are attacking us?” you ask.\n“Yeah, I mean…I dunno if they are. Maybe they’re just rabid humans or something, but they’re gnashing their teeth, moaning and coming at us like something out of a horror movie. We need all the help we can get to repel these things!”\n“We’ll be ready in a moment.” You say as Veronica shakes her head.\n“Well you two better hurry up, (Sigh) honestly, we’re getting attacked and you two are busy licking…”\n\nA loud crashing noise followed by gunfire is heard from downstairs.\n\n“Shit! That sounded close! I gotta go!” Veronica shouts and you hear her run off.\n\nWell at least it looks like Bobby’s finally lit a fire under his relative’s asses to pull their weight around here.\n\n“(Sigh) Fucking zombies. Of course this day couldn’t just be a pleasant one.” You say fumbling with your clothing.\n“I hope we get down there in time to help Bobby.” Helen says getting dressed as well.\n“We will, hold on let me get something first.”\n\nYou go to Bobby’s clothing drawer to get the spare gun he mentioned yesterday.\n\n“Hey, what about me?” Helen asks.\n“Well, just grab a blunt object! Unplug that desk lamp and use that to bash those freaks’ heads in I guess.”\n“Suzy, I don’t really want to argue, but do you even know how to use a gun properly? Maybe you should give me the gun and you just stay behind me.”\n“For your information my older brother Ben DID show me how to shoot a gun…a few times.”\n“A few times…Suzy, I was taught to fire a gun, aim and everything else before I was ten. I’m just saying in a situation like this, it might be best if I have the gun, I’m sure when we get to the others, Bobby will give you another one of his.” Helen remarks.\n“Yeah and in the mean time I’m fucking defenseless.”\n“You won’t be! I’ll protect you and I think you can count on that.” Helen says and then follows up by putting her arm around your waist and then sensually kissing you on the lips.\n\nYou ALMOST want to head right back to the bed, but unfortunately you’ve got more important things to deal with.\n\n“Okay, okay, you can take the gun, but me and you are definitely going to finish what we started after all this is over.” You say and go unplug the small desk lamp you mentioned earlier to Helen and take it as a makeshift weapon.\n\nThe pair of you head through the corridor and down the stairs both not making many comments at this point. Might be due to the situation being more than a little tense and its only getting more so as the gunfire, yelling and guttural noises are getting louder as you approach the center of the fighting.\n\nHelen then suddenly stops and turns to you.\n\n“Suzy?” Helen says.\n“What!?” you ask.\n“I just want you to know that if something goes wrong…”\n“Helen, nothing is going to go wrong, but we need to just focus and get to Bobby.”\n“Well just in case it does, I just want you to know I love…”\n“SHIT HELEN! SHOOT! SHOOT!” you exclaim when you see two creatures bursting through the door in front of you.\n\nHelen spins around and fires, hiting one of them square in the chest twice, but it doesn’t even slow down, it just tackles Helen onto the floor. She drops her pistol and struggles with the creature while calling for you to help and while you’d love to do just that, the second creature is currently trying to make a meal out of you.\n\nYou swing at the creature a couple times, but it moves in such a jerky motion that you don’t land a good hit and cause only a glancing blow to its head. Still it’s enough to give you a bit of a breather while the thing tries to get back up off the floor.\n\nYou spy the gun nearby and wonder if you should go for it or help Helen directly first.\n",
  "page 207": "And you silently dismiss that idea immediately!\n\nGrandma Morningstar may or may not have been right about your “flexible” sexuality, but even if she was, you are still not fucking Helen just because you feel sorry for her or on some whim!\n\nBesides, you’re about to marry Bobby and you made a damn commitment. You can’t just be fucking his sister, hours before the wedding. Maybe nobody else in this family has any much sense of “social mores” but that’s just wrong as far as your concerned. And even if Bobby WAS okay with it, you’re already making enough sacrifices for him and giving in to his possible secret desires for a harem aren’t part of that plan. You’re the only one and that’s that. You don’t fucking share.\n\nYou enter the bathroom and go through your usual routine of showering and such. Afterwards you finally get around putting on the “wedding dress.”\n\nThe first thing you do is look at the dress before putting it on and wondering if it’s going to be bigger in the chest area. While you’re not lacking in that region, you’ve met Bobby’s grandmother (in dream form anyway) and she’s got at least another couple cup sizes on you. In fact her body type back in her prime was more of an old school 1950s pinup girl hourglass figure than your own “petite” size.\n\nThe funny thing is, as soon as you put it on, it seems to fit perfectly to your own body. The material isn’t any sort of spandex or stretchy material, it’s silk like Helen said, but given Bobby’s family’s strangeness, you have to wonder if it’s…magical?\n\n“Magical underwear.” You scoff; shaking your head in half disbelief you’re even considering it. Not surprisingly the stockings AND the shoes fit you perfectly as well.\n\nYeah, Grandma Morningstar probably had all this stuff weaved by a giant magical spider voodoo priest or some shit because it doesn’t make sense that any of this stuff would fit you so well.\n\nRegardless of its origins, you do feel pretty comfortable despite looking like a Hollywood streetwalker. The heels don’t even hurt your feet, though you’re still a little unsteady on them due to not being used to wearing such things. Let alone these being stilettos.\n\nThe last time you wore heels was when Uncle Ed made you wear stripperiffic clothing with the intent to lure Bobby and his dad into the woods where he could kill them. While everything turned out for the best because you met Bobby that fateful night, the part with Uncle Ed still gives you the shivers just thinking about it.\n\nYou look at yourself in the mirror one more time, before leaving the bathroom.\n\n“Well Suzy, you might look like a whore in this thing, but at least you look like a high priced one.” You say to yourself.\n\nWhen you exit the bathroom Helen stands up and looks at you.\n\n“Oh my. You’re…you’re…so beautiful looking. I knew it would fit you perfectly.” Helen gushes.\n“Yeah I am pretty hot looking in this get up. Shit, still can’t balance on these heels though.” You say.\n“Hmm, well maybe you can dispense with those. I mean I’d hate for you to fall down the stairs when we go show everyone how you look. Maybe we should take some pictures!” Helen says approaching you.\n“What? I thought I was just putting it on as a test drive as it were. While I won’t deny this stuff feels pretty comfortable on my skin that I don’t mind wearing it, I sort of don’t want to be walking around the house with it on until show time. Besides everyone can see how awesomely sexy I am then.”\n“I think they should see you now. It’ll raise the spirits around here seeing you dressed like this.” Helen remarks as she begins touching your arm.\n“Well it’ll raise something with the males around here when they see me of course. Not sure about the ladies of this house, though you’re getting a little too close there Helen.”\n“Oh please? At least go show Bobby. I know he’d like to see you.” Helen says ignoring your previous remark about invading your personal space.\n“I’m sure he’s really busy right now, besides isn’t it bad luck for me to see him right before the wedding?”\n“Oh you’re thinking of those silly traditions for other weddings. That’s not the case here. Come on I’ll take you to him.” Helen says and at this point is pulling on your hands almost causing you fall.\n“Hey! I nearly fell! I told you already that you’re too damn close!” you snap.\n\nHelen immediately backs away and looks down submissively.\n\n“I’m sorry Suzy. I didn’t mean to violate your personal space.”\n“(Sigh) It’s fine Helen…just calm down a bit and let me at least take these shoes off first before I go heading downstairs.”\n\nAs you sit down and start taking your shoes off, you and Helen start to hear noise from outside. The both of you go over to the window to take a peek.\n\nYou and Helen see several figures crawling under the truck blocking the broken front gate or trying to climb the fence. The ones that have gotten in are loping in a wild jerky like motion. They’re also screaming, howling and making inhuman sounds. From your vantage point they LOOK human, but they’re certainly not acting like it.\n\nThen the door swings open causing both you and Helen to jump a bit. It’s Veronica with a gun in hand.\n\n“What the hell are you two doing in here, dyking it out? Don’t you know we’re being attacked by zombies?” Veronica exclaims.\n“I was trying on my wedding dress, thank you very much and we only just saw the freaks outside, so they are zombies?” you say.\n“Yeah, I mean…I dunno if they are. Maybe they’re just rabid humans or something, but they’re gnashing their teeth, moaning and coming at us like something out of a horror movie. We need all the help we can get to repel these things!”\n“We’ll be ready in a moment.” You say.\n“Well hurry up or else there isn’t going to be a wedding. We’re having a hard time trying to…”\n\nA loud crashing noise followed by gunfire is heard from downstairs.\n\n“Shit! That sounded close! I gotta go!” Veronica shouts and you hear her run off.\n\nWell at least it looks like Bobby’s finally lit a fire under his relative’s asses to pull their weight around here.\n\n“(Sigh) Fucking zombies. Of course this day HAD to get worse…” you say shaking your head.\n“Suzy, we need to hurry to go help Bobby.” Helen says pointing out the obvious.\n“Yeah, hold on let me just get something.”\n\nYou go to Bobby’s clothing drawer to get the spare gun he mentioned yesterday.\n\n“Hey, what about me?” Helen asks.\n“Well, just grab a blunt object! Unplug that desk lamp and use that to bash those freaks’ heads in I guess.”\n“Suzy, I don’t really want to argue, but do you even know how to use a gun properly? Maybe you should give me the gun and you just stay behind me.”\n“What? I’m not giving you the gun! And for your information my older brother Ben DID show me how to shoot a gun…a few times.”\n“A few times…Suzy, I was taught to fire a gun, aim and everything else before I was ten. I’m just saying in a situation like this, it might be best if I have the gun, I’m sure when we get to the others, Bobby will give you another one of his.” Helen remarks.\n“Yeah and in the mean time I’m fucking defenseless.”\n“You won’t be! I’ll protect you and I think you can count on that.” Helen says.\n\nHelen’s insistence on wanting the gun is making you even more paranoid in this already fucked up situation. In the back of your mind you can’t help but think she’s going to shoot you even though the pair of you are supposed to be cool with each other. Of course it’s possible she’d just feel safer with the gun in her hand.\n\nYou don’t actually know if she’s a better shot than you, though you aren’t exactly a highly skilled sharp shooter. Especially after failing to hit Diana during your scuffle yesterday.\n",
  "page 35": "You really don’t want to do this, but you don’t see any choice.\n\n“Sorry.” You say and point the gun at Lifto who has just gotten off of you.\n“Wait.” he says which is just enough give you pause due to your nervousness and give Lifto time to grab the gun from you, or at least attempt to grab it because you actually manage to struggle for half a minute before he accidently shoots you with it.\n\nThe gun goes off, you catch a bullet in your throat and you fall backwards into Klepto.\n\n“Holy shit! I didn’t mean…” Lifto shouts.\n“SUZY! NO!” Klepto screams.\n“What the fuck did you do Lifto!?” Fatty yells.\n“Goddamn it!” Shrimpy exclaims.\n\nAt this point the rest of the shouting becomes one loud noise to your dying ears. As your vision starts to blur, Klepto cradles you in his arms trying to tell you to fight off your impending death.\n\nIt doesn’t work.\n",
  "page 34": "Billy has made it quite clear that no matter what happens you’re going to be on the bottom rung of any sort of restructuring so why should you even bother? This whole area is going to shit and it would be best if you just got the hell out of here.\n\n“Do any of you have keys to your vehicles?” you ask.\n“I got my truck keys.” Lifto remarks.\n“Good, we’re getting the hell out of here while everyone is distracted.”\n“What?! We’re just going to leave Billy?” Shrimpy asks.\n“Look, if YOU want to help Billy then go right ahead, but he’s basically said that I’m the low girl on the totem pole, and I am NOT going to go through a bunch of verbal and possible physical abuse for the rest of my time here. I left home to get away from that shit. Quite frankly given how disliked clowns are around here, I’d suggest the rest of you follow me because no matter who wins, you’re going to lose.” You say and turn to leave\n\nLifto, Klepto and Fatty don’t even think twice, they’re following you out the tent and leaving the chaos of the carnival clash behind. Shrimpy however is unsure, his loyalty to his “kind” is still holding him back, but you’re not waiting around.\n\nWhen you exit the tent, things aren’t much better. There aren’t any guardsmen in the immediate area, but you still hear the shooting and their yelling. You also hear odd growling sounds and a couple of screams.\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on, but we need to get to your truck NOW!” you exclaim where upon Lifto takes the lead.\n\nYou don’t get too far when you see Roger staggering from between two other tents. He’s wounded heavily and bleeding profusely. He sees you and desperately calls for your help.\n\n“Suzy…hel…” is about all he gets out before collapsing a few feet from you. He tries to crawl towards you and you nearly head towards him to help, but given all the gunfire going on and the big brawl still going on, you focus on your goal of placing as much distance as possible from this place.\n\n“Sorry, Roger.” You say quietly and continue moving.\n\nLifto points towards a pick up truck in the area where you first parked your own vehicle.\n\n“Shh, you hear that?” Klepto remarks.\n“No.” you remark.\n“Exactly. All the gunfire stopped.”\n“Well we need to hurry up because that either means the guardsmen killed whoever was attacking and they’ll be returning to us soon or…”\n\nAnd then from behind one of the army vehicles you’re passing something leaps onto Lifto. It’s human but its snarling and growling unnaturally. If you didn’t know any better you’d almost think it was a….\n\n“ARGH! ZOMBIE!” Lifto shouts and struggles to get it off of him. Fatty moves in to help immediately and between the two of them they easily knock it to the ground. Lifto then proceeds to stomp on its head repeatedly with his brightly colored clown boots.\n\nWhile Lifto is determined to smash its head into mush, another one of these creatures pop out of nowhere and nearly grab you. You scream and manage to pull away before Klepto steps in and tries to help.\n\nUnfortunately the creatures manage to bite him in the process. He cries out in pain, but manages to get the creatures off of him thanks to someone else helping by blowing the thing’s head off. Blood, bone and brains splatter all over Klepto.\n\n“Come on! I don’t know how many more of these things there are!” Shrimpy shouts with one of the guardsmen’s assault rifles in both hands. Looks like he’s made his choice.\n\nLifto finishes destroying the one that was attacking him and soon all of you are off and running again. You look around as you run thinking more are going to be jumping out at you, but that doesn’t happen. You are slightly concerned about Fatty getting bit though. You don’t think anyone else has noticed it yet except you and of course him.\n\nWhen you get to the truck, Lifto quickly opens up the driver side and opens up the passenger door. You get in, followed by Klepto, meanwhile Fatty gets in the bed of the truck along with Shrimpy.\n\n“Where the hell are we going?” Lifto says as he drives from the carnival.\n“I don’t know yet, but we probably should stay away from large areas of population if those…things are any indication. Just head further away from the town for now.” You say.\n\nHonestly you don’t know what comes next, but you’re seriously starting to believe Roofie’s comments about the end coming soon. Were those creatures zombies? Crazed humans? Alive? Undead? Does it matter? How many are there? Have they overrun civilization already? Has any of your old family survived? Is this the beginning of the end?\n\nAnd most importantly…do their bites work like they do in the movies?\n\nKlepto sits next to you nervously still clutching his arm where he was bit. Lifto hasn’t noticed yet because he’s been paying attention to the road and while you haven’t said anything yet Klepto’s not subtle enough about keeping his wound secret…\n\n“Why do you keep rubbing your arm?” Lifto remarks.\n“Uh, that thing grabbed me and its grip hurt a lot and uh…”\n“Klepto, I’ve known you long enough to know when you’re lying! Did that thing bite you?!”\n\nKlepto doesn’t answer so you try to unsuccessfully help.\n\n“It was just a little bite, we don’t even know if…” you start to say before you’re interrupted.\n“Oh fuck! That’s it man! Game over!” Lifto shouts and suddenly stops the truck. Fatty and Shrimpy both knock on the window shouting what’s going on.\n\n“Klepto, I know we’ve known each other a long time, but you need to get out of this truck right now.”\n“Lifto, I…”\n“I don’t wanna hear it. Get out before I make you get out or worse.”\n“Lifto, we don’t even know if this is infectious! This isn’t a movie you know!” you exclaim.\n“And you willing to take that chance? You’re sitting right next to him! Not to mention he’s covered in that thing’s blood when Shrimpy blew its head off. Who knows what the hell he’s caught.”\n\nAs paranoid as Lifto is right now, you have been feeling a little nervous sitting next to Klepto this whole time.\n\nWithout another word Lifto shifts towards you and reaches over towards the glove compartment. He opens it up revealing a pistol, though Klepto already figured out what he was doing and tries to grab it before Lifto can.\n\nDespite Lifto being in an awkward position and you being in his way, he’s strong enough to get the grip on the gun first. Klepto grabs his hand and the struggle ensues.\n\nAt this point Fatty opens up the driver side door and Shrimpy opens up the passenger side.\n\n“What the fuck is going on here!?” Shrimpy asks.\n“ARGH! Sonofabitch!” Lifto suddenly shouts, Klepto has bitten his hand causing him to drop the pistol on the truck floor.\n“Shrimpy keep that rifle on Klepto!” Lifto shouts.\n\nYou’re stuck in the middle with Lifto’s body half on you. All you know is you’re scared and desperate to get out. You manage to wiggle down a bit and grab the pistol on the floor.\n\nKlepto hasn’t proceeded with an attack and doesn’t look any different.\n\n“I’m not a zombie! Or whatever you think I am! I’m fine! And if you kill me, you’re going to have to kill Lifto too!” Klepto exclaims to everyone.\n\nKlepto may or may not be right, but he was pretty quick to bite Lifto. Whether that was a desperate attempt to ensure his own safety or a possible glimpse of what’s to come, you don’t know.\n\nWith the pistol in your hand you don’t know if you shouldn’t just shoot them both.\n",
  "page 209": "You’re making a big leap in faith here…\n\nYou look at Helen and the gun, then with a deep exhale you slowly hand it to her.\n\nHelen takes the pistol and checks it before addressing you.\n\n“You still don’t trust me do you?” Helen says looking a little hurt.\n“I gave you the gun didn’t I? Come on let’s go deal with these zombies, or whatever they are before they eat us or something.”\n“Um, aren’t you going to change your clothing?” Helen asks.\n“Huh? Oh.” You say not even realizing you were still dressed the way you were. “No, it’s my fucking wedding day, but I will be taking this.” You say and then unplug the small desk lamp you mentioned earlier to Helen and take it as a makeshift weapon.\n“Um, okay then.” Helen remarks and the pair of you are out the door with her taking the lead.\n\nThe pair of you head through the corridor and down the stairs both not making many comments at this point. Might be due to the situation being more than a little tense and its only getting more so as the gunfire, yelling and guttural noises are getting louder as you approach the center of the fighting.\n\nAs you approach yet another door, suddenly two of the creatures burst through it. The sight and surprise cause the both of you to scream, but Helen manages to keep her cool long enough to shoot the first creature directly in the head, dropping it immediately.\n\nThe second one however tackles Helen to the floor. She drops her pistol and struggles with the creature while calling for you to help. You don’t even bother scrambling for the gun yourself; you just smash the side of the thing’s head with the lamp you already have in hand, which is enough to cause it roll off of Helen, but not enough to kill it.\n\nWith a massive head wound the thing starts to move again, continuing to make all sorts of horrible guttural noises. Helen however has retaken possession of the gun again and fires two more shots into the thing’s face. It ceases moving and slumps lifelessly to the floor.\n\n“Shit, that was intense.” You say.\n“Yeah, thanks for getting that thing off me.” Helen remarks.\n“No problem. Guess it was a good idea handing you the gun afterall. You are a much better shot. I probably would’ve missed and dropped the damn gun as soon as those zombies came running through the door.”\n“Y’know these things aren’t really rotten looking or anything. Maybe they aren’t undead.” Helen says.\n“Well I still don’t want to get killed and eaten by some virus infected asshole. Come on, this isn’t over yet.” You say and help Helen up.\n\nBy the time you get to Bobby and the rest of the family’s location, they’ve managed to wipe out most of the things and you and Helen don’t have much to do. Still, you wonder about their origin. Some sort of sickness perhaps? Maybe the government was fucking around with a secret weapon like they tend to do and it got out of hand. It would explain why there was a drastic rise in violence even before you left town and why the National Guard showed up later.\n\nIt isn’t until after all the mad attackers are killed that Bobby manages to address you directly. He’s incredibly tired looking, the rest of his family looks pretty tired too, but he looks like he’s about to collapse.\n\n“Are you okay?! They didn’t bite you did they?” Bobby asks, stumbling a bit from exhaustion.\n“No, I’m fine. We both are.” You reply.\n“Suzy saved my life.” Helen remarks.\n“Well, I think we both saved each other more than enough times this week.” You say which causes a bit of a happiness of Helen’s face.\n“I’m just glad the both of you are okay. I have to ask though, what’s with your clothing?” Bobby asks.\n“Oh yeah, I guess Veronica didn’t tell you, I was trying on the wedding dress when all this shit went down. Speaking of which let’s get this wedding started! I’m anxious to get married!” you say and go up to Bobby giving him a kiss.\n\nNow you’ve caught everyone off guard. One moment they’re fighting for their lives, the next they’re attending a wedding.\n\n“Now?” Bobby asks.\n“We just won a great victory and I’m in my wedding dress. What better time than now?” you ask.\n“Well I suppose you have a point.” Bobby says with a smile.\n“Good! I’m ready to become part of this family.” You say.\n\nBobby looks around at the rest of his family.\n\n“Well, you heard my soon to be wife! Let’s get this started! Helen go get the kids, Brandon, Ronald, go grab Diana and the rest of you do a quick sweep of the house just to make sure we got all those bastards. Let’s go!” Bobby orders.\n\nEveryone complies and soon you and Bobby are left by yourselves. Bobby takes a seat to briefly rest. He yawns several times in a row and is struggling to stay awake, but you can tell your enthusiasm for the wedding has energized him a bit. You decide to keep the energy going by sitting on his lap and making a fuss.\n\n“Hey, it’s not time for the honeymoon yet.” Bobby remarks with a brief chuckle.\n“Oh it’s always times for the honeymoon with you.” You say.\n“Damn, I wish I wasn’t so tired…hope I don’t stumble over the joining passage when I’m marrying us.” Bobby remarks as he rubs your legs.\n“Wait, isn’t someone else doing that?”\n“Huh? No, I’m doing it. I mean I’m the high priest here. Technically it could just be me and you here.”\n“What? That’s it? We could’ve done that a long time ago!”\n“Well, like I’ve told you before, I just wanted it to be perfect.”\n\nYou wrap your arms around Bobby and lean your body against him.\n\n“Bobby, just being with you, is enough perfection for me. Besides, isn’t the carnage surrounding us true perfection in the eyes of Tiamat’s chaotic glory or something?” you ask.\n\nBobby looks around at the nearby mess of broken furniture and the couple bodies laying on the floor and smiles.\n\n“Yes, I suppose you’re right.” He says and then pauses. “You know I’ve been thinking. I’ll take care of Diana personally; you don’t need to worry about her anymore. You don’t need to go through some sacrifice ritual just to prove yourself…I know you love me and that you’re one of us now. No need to dirty your hands on her.”\n“That’s sweet and I’m really glad you feel that way. But I’ll take the knife anyway, I’ve got something special in mind.” You say.\n“Oh? Like what?”\n“Oh, you’ll see.” You say with a smile.\n\nA few more moments pass as you wait for everyone to return. In the meantime you let Bobby rest a bit by closing his eyes. Veronica and Denise return first, then Helen with all the children. Finally Brandon and Ronald arrive gripping Diana by each arm. Predictably she’s swearing up a storm and accusing everyone of being against her.\n\nIt wakes Bobby up from his brief nap.\n\n“Oh? Everyone here? Good. Let’s get this started. (Yawn) Sorry, I’m so damn tired…”\n“Bobby, you don’t need to stand up for this, just keep resting in your chair and I’ll just be right here on your lap. I’m sure that’s acceptable to everyone right?” you ask.\n\nNobody has any real objections to this, well except Diana of course.\n\n“Bobby! You’re making a fucking mistake! I’M your soul mate! I’M the one supposed to marry you! You’re betraying Tiamat and everything we hold dear!” she screams.\n\nIgnoring Diana, Bobby recites what you guess is a passage from whatever holy book of Tiamat he got it from and when the time comes, you accept your place as his wife.\n\nThen the both of you kiss like you’ve done so many times before, though this time it’s different. Most of Bobby’s family claps if they are able. You now feel like you belong here.\n\n“Here. I’ve been carrying this in my pocket the whole day, nearly forgot it was there.” Bobby remarks and hands you a ring with a sizable red diamond in the center and smaller black inlayed around it. It’s definitely beautiful and when you try it on, you find that it fits perfectly. Diana’s eyes would burn through you if they could.\n\n“You…you gave her grandma’s ring?! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! You dishonor that woman! I hope grandma’s spirit comes back and rapes the pair of you with a fucking broom handle!” Diana shouts.\n\nAt this point Bobby calmly pulls out a knife and hands it to you.\n\n“Did you still want the honors?” Bobby asks.\n\nYou take the knife and look over at Helen, who is trying her best to look supportive. Well, you know she IS supportive, but you also know that this isn’t really what she wants. Still, maybe there is a way to make things just a little better for her.\n\n“Helen, you and I have been through a lot this week and in this week I’ve come to see you as the sister I never had. Now that I’m officially part of this family, we ARE sisters. I know this is my day, but I feel like I should at least share some of my fortune with you. So here you go. Time to finally put all those years of bullying to rest.” You say and hand Helen the knife.\n\nHelen is shocked by your gesture. Several other family members are as well. Diana however is still livid.\n\n“Oh by Tiamat’s Chaotic Cunt…I’m not believing this…fine. I’ve been a bullying bitch to you, I won’t deny that, is that what you want to hear? But if you REALLY love Bobby as much as I KNOW you do, you’ll take that knife and stab the shit out of that bitch over there before you stab me, because if you don’t you’re just going to play second fiddle to blondie for the rest of your life and NEVER get Bobby. And you’ll just be loser like you alw…UGH!” Diana’s words are interrupted when Helen rushes to her and stabs her in the chest.\n\n“SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! YOU FUCKING BITCH! YOU WERE ALWAYS IN THE FUCKING WAY! JUST FUCKING DIE! DIE! JUST DIE ALREADY! I FUCKING HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! DIE!” Helen screams alternating between laughing and crying while stabbing Diana. Brandon and Ronald let go of Diana and everyone just watches Helen’s meltdown.\n\nWhen it’s all said and done, Helen is on top of her sister’s bloody body and the floor covered in blood.\n\n“I…always…(pant)…why? Why couldn’t you (sob) have…just been nice…(sob) just once? Nice…like…Suzy.” Helen says in a quivering voice and looks at you.\n\nAt this point you get up and walk over to Helen. You even kneel down in the blood next to her. She drops the knife and goes to hug you and completely falls apart in your arms.\n\n“Shhh, it’s okay Helen…it’s okay. It’s over now…” you say.\n\nHelen looks at you and nods silently. While she sniffles and tries to compose herself, you address everyone who are probably starting to form their own ideas about what Diana might’ve been babbling about. Even Bobby is alert again.\n\n“Okay folks, I’m sure we need to clean up around here after this recent attack and I also imagine that Bobby could use some rest, so let’s help him out and get to it!” you say.\n\nClean up goes relatively fast. Around the house at least since that’s your primary concern. You go for the quick dirty approach of just getting all the dead bodies in one pile outside. You briefly think about burning them, but Bobby says that might attract attention and doing it tomorrow when everyone is more awake enough to defend this place properly is a better idea.\n\nBroken windows and the front door are barricaded with furniture for the night.\n\nSomewhere just after midnight everyone is ready to crash. Bobby, who has been practically sleep walking by this point just tells everyone to sleep with a weapon tonight and you can all just roll the dice without a night watch tonight. Nobody argues.\n\nYou help Bobby upstairs and the pair of you collapse on the bed. You won’t be celebrating your honeymoon tonight, but at least you’ll be sleeping together.\n\nYou cuddle up to Bobby who is fast asleep at this point and head into dreamland yourself, fully expecting Grandma Morningstar to fuck with you in some way as usual.\n",
  "page 37": "You didn’t leave the carnival just for MORE in fighting. If the end days are coming you NEED all the people who you are actually on good terms you can get because you don’t fancy your chances on going it alone. So you’ll be damned if you’re not going to try to keep this little group together.\n\n“ALRIGHT GODDAMN IT! STOP IT! JUST FUCKING STOP IT!” you shout pointing the gun towards the truck ceiling. Lifto at this point has returned to his driver’s seat position.\n\n“NOW EVERYONE OUT OF THE TRUCK AND JUST LISTEN!” you say looking at Lifto and briefly glancing back at Klepto.\n\nLifto steps out looks at you as if he is thinking about taking the pistol away from you. He probably could without any problems because as close as you are to shooting someone, you aren’t exactly “there” yet.\n\nThankfully Lifto doesn’t try anything.\n\nWhen everyone exits the truck, you follow and Shrimpy now stands by you as back up (Fatty doesn’t have a weapon, but he stands near you anyway)\n\n“Okay, Suzy what next?” Lifto calmly says.\n\nYou’ve got an idea, but it would go better if rope was involved. You take a quick look in the truck bed and see some locks and chains sitting there, which will work just as well.\n\n“Look everyone, we don’t have all the information on what this creature situation is, killing someone who got bit, might be jumping the gun. I mean this isn’t a movie!” you say.\n“Yeah!” Klepto says.\n“Shut up, I haven’t finished! Of course that doesn’t mean we need to be foolish about this because Lifto could be right. Now Lifto we don’t know if a bite causes infection, but if it does then you’re already doomed unless we cut your hand off, but I’m guessing you don’t want that. Do you want that?”\n\nLifto gives a dirty look at Klepto before answering.\n\n“Look if you’re going to shoot me, at least shoot Klepto first so I can watch.” Lifto says.\n“ What the…I thought you two were supposed to be friends! (Sigh) I’m trying to give you another option here! Like I said, we don’t know if this sort of thing is contagious. I don’t want any of us to die, do you get that? I’m proposing that the pair of you stay in the bed of the truck until we get to a destination where we can get some medical attention. I mean if the pair of you start not feeling well or different in any way, then we can consider shooting you.”\n\nLifto doesn’t say anything, but Klepto is certainly agreeable.\n\n“Sure Suzy, whatever you say! I mean that sounds reasonable to me!” he remarks, though you get the impression he’d go along with what you’d say even if he wasn’t bitten.\n“We’re going to have to tie you up you know.” You say.\n“That’s fine. I totally get it.” Klepto remarks.\n“Lifto?”\n\nHe exhales and doesn’t say anything while looking at his hand. Then he looks back at you.\n\n“You really don’t want any of us to die?” Lifto asks.\n“No. Why the hell would I want that? I mean if these are the end days coming then we’re all we have left! We need to stick together as much as possible. And in any case you lot are the closest I’ve had to family for years, well other than the fact that most of you are undressing me with your eyes half the time…but I’m getting off track my point is that despite all the fucked up shit that’s occurred this week, I know I want you guys in my corner. All of you.”\n\nAt first you wonder if you’ve laid it on a bit too much, but you hear a couple of sniffles in Fatty’s direction and Klepto is obviously showing signs of emotion. He probably thinks you just professed your love for him or something.\n\n“Okay. Okay. We’ll do it your way, but if I start to turn or if I think I’m going to become something other than I am, then I want YOU to be the one to shoot me.” Lifto says.\n“Well let’s hope it doesn’t come to that, but I promise.” You say.\n\nWith those words Lifto and Klepto both submit to being chained up and to sit in the truck bed. Lifto is still giving Klepto angry looks, but hopefully they can work out their differences during the ride.\n\nFatty takes the wheel, Shrimpy gets in the middle and you sit near the passenger’s side. You’ve never exactly been the best with directions, so you just tell Fatty to stay on the main road and hopefully you’ll reach a place that is in better shape than your own home town which probably is a warzone by now. You can’t help but wonder how your real family is doing, but really you’d rather not dwell on it.\n\nFatty turns on the radio in the hopes of finding out something, but he doesn’t get much other than a few random religious stations talking about salvation and end times, but those things are ALWAYS talking about the end times so its hard to tell if they’re even referring to what’s currently going on. You’d think something like the news or an emergency broadcast might pop up, but nothing. Oddly you do get some stations just playing nothing but those infernal Ground Zero advertisements.\n\nHours pass of driving through farm country and Klepto and Lifto aren’t moaning or even arguing so you’re guessing that they’re feeling okay. Still, even though you don’t want any of them to die, you do know it still might be a possibility.\n\nAs it begins to turn to night you’re already tired from the events of the day. Feeling somewhat safe you allow yourself to close your eyes and drift off as the truck drives onward.\n",
  "page 39": "If you ran, you doubt if the rest of them would follow and despite the feeling that this isn’t the greatest idea, you’re tired of running. You’ve got nothing to run to anyway, if you can deal with the inhabitants inside, you’ll at least have a place to catch a breather from the ever-growing chaos in your life.\n\nYou hope at least.\n\n“Shrimpy can you get inside the truck without getting hit and put it in neutral?”\n“Yeah I think I could.” Shrimpy says.\n“Good, give me the rifle and the clips, get in the truck and when it’s in neutral Lifto and Fatty I want you to start pushing it forward. We should be able to get close enough to the house using this thing as a large shield.”\n“What are you going to be doing?” Fatty asks.\n“I’m going to be crawling around in the truck bed taking shots at that bastard firing at us when I can. Hopefully the closer we get the more likely I’ll be able to hit him. Now you want to avenge Klepto or what?”\n\nThis statement gets a nod from everyone.\n\n“Let’s do this.” Lifto says and all of you enact your plan.\n\nIt goes well, or about as well as a plan can when someone is shooting at you. Another person soon joins the farmer the closer the truck gets to the front of the house. Presumably the farmer’s wife. The pair of them unleash a torrent of curses at you, but nobody is hitting each other yet.\n\nBullets tear into the truck and while you’re all safe, when the two front tires get blown out, it makes Lifto and Fatty’s pushing a lot harder.\n\n“Goddamn it. (Wheeze)” Fatty gasps.\n“Fuck.” Lifto grunts.\n\nStill crawling around in the truck bed, you head over towards the back and speak to Lifto and Fatty.\n“Okay, stop pushing, no point in straining yourself, because you’re going to need to save your energy. I don’t think the shooter on the left is quite as skilled so run to the left and around the back of the house, there’s got to be a back door. I’ll provide cover, I still got a half a clip left in this thing and one more full one, so when I go full auto, start running. Here take the pistol.” You say tossing the pistol over the back end of the truck.\n\nHonestly you’d rather have Shrimpy do this since he’s a much smaller target, but the little guy is probably hiding in the leg area of either the driver or passenger’s side of the truck hoping not to get hit.\n\nYou take a deep breath as more bullets tear into the sides of the truck. You grip the rifle and exposing only a bit of your hands, you blindly fire and spray the left area of the house where the second shooter is.\n\nLuckily through the gunfire a small cry is heard, you think you’ve hit someone again.\n\nIn any case it allows time for Lifto and Fatty to crouch run towards the house, hug the wall and then crawl around the corner. Fatty sure is fast when he wants to be, you just hope he doesn’t suffer a heart attack. Meanwhile you hear shouting within the house.\n\n“Clem! I’m hit! Ohhhhh…(sob)”\n“Honeypie?! Honeypie? No no no…”\n\nWith the gunfire completely stopped Shrimpy takes the opportunity to get out of the truck and run behind it.\n\n“Suzy? You still here?” you hear him ask.\n“Yeah, I’m still here. Just stay behind the truck I’m gonna…” you start to say before you’re interrupted\n\n“NO! GODAMNIT! NOOOO! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU ALL!” Clem the farmer shouts and now the sounds of gunfire start up again, except this time he’s not firing a rifle anymore, the booming sound indicates a shotgun of some kind.\n\nAs you try to reload your last assault rifle clip, the truck continues to suffer the impact of shotgun rounds. In fact they are starting to damage the truck enough that one of them going through and hitting you is a very real possibility. You roll over to the other side of the truck in an attempt not to get hit.\n\n“I’LL KILL ALL OF YOU!” you hear him bellow. You’re too busy keeping down and redloading.\n\nAnd then you hear nothing, followed by a pistol shot and then another. You take the opportunity to quickly climb out of the truck bed altogether.\n\n“Suzy, did they get him?” Shrimpy asks\n“I don’t know…” you say and peek your head out hoping that this isn’t a mistake.\n\nYou soon see Lifto standing in the front doorway with the pistol in hand.\n\n“We got all of these bastards. It’s safe.” He says.\n\nYou and Shrimpy both step out from the cover of the truck and make your way to the house.\n\nFirst thing you notice is the first man you shot near the entryway, apparently he tried to crawl away soon after the shoot out started and died shortly afterwards. Given his disfigurement and from what you could tell of his voice, he might’ve been mentally retarded. You remember hearing “junior” being said, so you’re guessing he was the son. You don’t exactly feel great about shooting him. It really was an accident.\n\nSeeing the other two bodies don’t exactly make you feel any better.\n\nThe farmer’s wife lies dead in the dining room area. She’s actually bigger than Fatty which means she’s indeed quite on the large side. She has several gunshot wounds to her upper body. You knew you hit her, but you just didn’t know where. Your stomach begins to feel slightly bad when you think about it.\n\nFinally you see the farmer himself, or Clem as you heard being shouted. Lifto mentions that Clem was so focused on you that he realized too late that someone was sneaking up on him. Lifto mentions that he shot him in the back and then while Clem was still flopping about on the floor trying to turn over with his shotgun, Clem put one in his skull.\n\nYou didn’t even kill Clem and you still feel weird about it. You don’t understand why you’re feeling slightly sick about all this. Or rather you’ve got an idea why, but considering the little creature rampage at the carnival it isn’t like you haven’t seen gruesome death before, but this is somehow different.\n\nThe adrenaline and survivalist mindset you put yourself into has disappeared now that the danger has passed so you are left with the grim aftermath of your actions.\n\nThe realization that you’ve killed an entire family that was really just defending their home is what is getting to you. That and the fact that you feel like this whole incident is your fault. Adding Klepto’s death to the mix and you’re directly and indirectly responsible for four people’s deaths.\n\n“Toilet.” You say in a daze.\n“What?” Shrimpy asks.\n“I’m gonna be sick…”\n“I think I saw one over towards the back of the house, it’s…”\n\nYou don’t wait for Lifto to finish you just run in the direction. Trying to keep from throwing up and you just manage to make it to the toilet where upon you promptly vomit your guts out.\n\nYour fellows come to see how you’re doing.\n\n“Suzy, are you alright?” Shrimpy asks.\n“Yeah, you aren’t sick are you?” Lifto asks.\n\nIt takes you awhile to answer, but eventually you manage it.\n\n“Uh…(pant)…I just…I dunno…yeah I’ll be fine. I think the stress of all this just got to me. Uh…” You say.\n“Well, it’s understandable. Look, why don’t you go lie down somewhere? You’ve done enough for today. The rest of us are gonna drag these bodies out of here. It’ll take all of us, lord knows what the hell they were eating on this farm, but everyone here seems to be Fatty’s size or bigger. Probably should look around the rest of the farm as well. Make sure nobody is hiding in the barns or something.” Lifto remarks.\n“Yeah…okay…” you say walking past Shrimpy and Lifto.\n\nAs you slowly walk back towards the front of the house, Fatty comes down the stairs.\n\n“Well the upstairs is clear from what I can tell. Nobody up there. Hey Suzy, you okay? Could hear you retching from up there.” Fatty asks.\n“Yeah, just need to lie down.” You say.\n“You and me both, but I suppose Lifto is going to need me to help him move out these bodies. Anyway, there are some nice beds upstairs, probably should take one of them.”\n\nAt this point you feel so wobbly that you wonder if you can even make it up the stairs.\n",
  "page 38": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“…don’t delay, buy a Ground Zero shelter today!”\n\n“Fatty turn that radio off, there hasn’t been anything on it of importance for hours. It’s just those damn Ground Zero ads. Christ, you’d think someone would be reporting about oh you know a zombie apocalypse?” Shrimpy says.\n“I still say those things are still alive. The ones we saw didn’t look like they came back from the dead or anything.” Fatty remarks.\n“Well whatever, still seems like reporting SOME sort of outbreak would be of importance.”\n“Maybe its local and not happening anywhere else?”\n\nAt this point your eyes open and you completely rouse from your sleep.\n\n“(Yawn) What’s going on?” you ask.\n“So you’re finally awake.” Shrimpy says.\n“We’ve been driving all night?” you ask.\n“Somewhat. Fatty here pulled over at one point and we both slept a little. If you’re wondering about the gruesome twosome back there, we checked on them and from what I can tell both of them feel fine. In fact I think they’re both still sleeping. Guess all that bite drama yesterday really exhausted them. Dunno if that means they’re okay or not, but right now we do have another problem.” Shrimpy says.\n“What’s that?” you ask.\n“Well Fatty here managed to get us fucking lost.”\n“Hey it’s not my fault, I couldn’t see shit in the night and I thought we were on a main road. Damn GPS.” Fatty says.\n“Told you that it was broken and hasn’t worked correctly for years. Anyway, I know you’re native to this area so I’m hoping you know your way around.” Shrimpy says.\n\nA brief glance of the practically non-descript landscape to the left and right of you leaves you at a loss.\n\n“Sorry, but like I said, I never was a big traveller. Never left the basement if I could help it.” You say.\n“Oh yeah, that’s right. Well any suggestion regardless of that fact?” Shrimpy asks.\n\nYou don’t really have any, though you probably should be near some sort of farmhouse as you do know there are some out this way. You could get your bearing by stopping at one and asking for directions.\n\nYou also remember Fatty’s comment about supplies.\n\n“There should be some sort of farmhouse nearby. Just keep driving along this road and we’ll probably hit one where we can ask for directions and possibly get supplies.”\n“Sounds like as good of an idea as any.”\n\nYou really don’t know if that will be the case, you’re just hoping at this point.\n\nFortunately, your hopes come true this time.\n\n“Well, there’s a house. Can’t tell if anyone is home or not though.” Fatty says pulling up to a large traditional looking farmhouse.\n“Okay, so how are we doing this?”\n“Well…I suppose I’ll go up to the front door and see if anyone’s home and the rest of you guys stay in the truck.” You say.\n“You nuts? This place looks like it’s out of a horror movie! Might be a bunch of psycho rednecks living in there! They see a pretty young thing like you and they’d grab you before we could even do anything.” Shrimpy remarks.\n“Right like arriving at a door with a group of clowns isn’t straight out of a horror movie. I’m currently the only one dressed in regular clothing and not covered in blood, I think it would be best if I just asked for help at first.”\n“Hey what are we going to do with Klepto and Lifto?” Fatty asks.\n“Well check on them again and if they seem to be well unchain them I guess. I mean they could use a stretch. Anyway like I said I’m going to the door. I’m taking the pistol with me and I’m confident that if something does happen you’ll be able to react in time to save me from getting chopped up or whatever you think is going to happen. We need help getting back on track and looking at the gauge we might even need gas so hopefully they got that here too. Don’t worry I’ll be fine.” You say and get out of the truck.\n\nYou make your way towards the front porch looking around the entire time. This place is creepily quiet. Seems like you should at least hear the sounds of animals or something. Shrimpy’s got you totally paranoid now. You really weren’t worried until he mentioned psycho hillbillies. You look back at the truck.\n\n“Goddamn it Suzy, you need to brave through some of this shit yourself. You survived your serial killer uncle for Christsake. Nothing is going to happen, probably just some kindly old farm couple that lives here.” You mutter to yourself and walk up the stairs and knock on the door.\n\nYou knock several times with no answer, but just when you’re about to give up it opens.\n\n“WHO YOU!?” a large disfigured man exclaims completely scaring the shit out of you and causing you to fall backwards.\n\nYou’re in a state of utter fear as this large freak approaches you with his hand outstretched towards you…\n\nEven in your fearful condition, you’re still able to react to a dangerous situation. You pull the pistol that you had on you and shoot the disfigured man. You hit him twice in the body and he reels backwards bellowing loudly as his body hits the front door and then the house’s front room floor.\n\n“WHHHHHHY!? GOING TO HELP YOU!” the man shouts.\n\n“Junior? What in tarnation is goin’ on down there? I hope you didn’t shoot yourself in the foot carrying your father’s rifles again, you know how he hates a waste of ammo.” An older female voice shouts from inside.\n“MAMA! MAMA! HURT A LOT! BAD GIRL HURT ME!” the man cries.\n“If you’ve been fightin’ with you’re sister again…oh my god…JUNIOR! CLEM SOMEONE SHOT JUNIOR!” you hear the older female voice scream.\n\nBy this time you’re running back to the truck, which Shrimpy has gotten out of. Lifto and Klepto are also both awake and shouting at this point.\n\n“Get back in the fucking truck! We gotta…” you start yelling and then a shot from one of the farmhouse windows rings out. You hear it whiz by your ear causing you to drop to the ground immediately.\n\nYou continue to crawl towards the truck where you hear more gunfire behind you and the sounds of an assault rifle returning fire. You hear someone trying to start the truck, but a few more shots hitting metal seem to put an end to that causing the engine to make a less than operational sound.\n\n“Fatty get out of the front seat!” Shrimpy shouts.\n\nYou hear more gunshots followed by Fatty crying out, though you don’t know if he’s actually gotten hit severely since you just hear “OW MY ASS!”\n\nThe whole time you’re praying that you don’t get shot in the back, but you’re the lucky one…\n\nEver the white knight, Klepto attempts to go “rescue” you.\n\n“Klepto get out of the open!” you hear Lifto shout.\n“Suzy’s out there I can’t…” Klepto’s words are cut short when a bullet to his skull drops him. In fact he drops about a few feet in front of you. You try to put the sight of his death out of your mind as you continue to crawl towards the truck.\n\n“YOU FUCKERS AREN’T TAKING THIS FARM! THIS FARM IS MINE! ALL OF YOU SONSOFBITCHES ARE GONNA PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MY BOY!” a male voice shouts.\n\nYou finally reach your destination where the rest are hiding behind the back of the truck, though Fatty’s having a hard time of it due to his size and the fact he’s got a bullet in his ass.\n\nThe shooting on both sides for now has stopped though.\n\n“Shit, shit, shit, Klepto’s dead! That redneck bastard says that we’re going to pay, no fucking way, HE’S gonna fuckin’ pay!” Lifto says which is a bit surprising considering that he was ready to kill Klepto himself just yesterday.\n\n“Fuck, my ass…ah! Shit…wish I had a gun, I’d shoot that fucker in the ass. Not the cheek either, the fucking HOLE!” Fatty says who is normally calm, but given he got shot his anger is a bit understandable.\n\n“Well luckily I picked up a few extra clips back at the carnival and Suzy’s probably still got a few shots left. I say we can probably take out the shooter with a bit of strategy. Just as soon as we come up with one of course.” Shrimpy remarks.\n\nYou don’t know how to feel about all this. Maybe it’s all the increased violence over the past few days along with losing Klepto, but your clown crew is starting to become a lot more vicious, though events haven’t exactly been encouraging a peaceful life lately.\n\nYou can’t help but feel a little responsible for this current situation though. The retard was just trying to help you up from your fall, but you couldn’t have known that…you just reacted to your fear. You were the one who harmed the farm inhabitants first even if the rest of your clown friends think you were being attacked.\n\nPart of you wants to just run from this place, but where would you go? Staying of course means doing more things you don’t necessarily want to do…but then you think if you can put yourself in the “right” frame of mind you’ll be able to do it.\n\nThe farmer HAS tried to kill all of you and did succeed in killing Klepto who attempted to save you, surely revenge for that isn’t totally wrong?\n",
  "page 31": "Nice and Safe\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“Take it or leave it. Don’t have all day to haggle with you.” You say to the scavenger.\n\nHe looks at the plastic bag of 9mm ammo for a moment.\n\n“Alright I’ll take it.” He says and hands over two damaged rifles and takes the ammo without another word and leaves.\n\nYou look at the rifles again and think how glad you are to have someone who has a natural affinity to fixing thing.\n\n“Daniel! Come out here, got a project for you.”\n\nYou son comes out from his work area to see what you’re yelling at him about this time.\n\n“Mom, what is it now?” Daniel replies.\n“Here. Got more rifles you can fix and we can sell for better profit later on.” You say and pass the rifles to him.\n“These need new bolts. I’m not sure if I have any spare ones. At least not for two rifles.”\n“Well do what you can. I’m sure you’ll think of something. You usually do. Besides you know how everyone that comes through this place is always interested in weapons. If you get just one of them fixed, it’ll still be a profit for what we got them for.”\n“Don’t most people buy their weapons from Earl on the far side of the bazaar?”\n“Yeah, but he specializes in that, the beauty of what we do is sell and buy a little bit of everything. So someone who might be looking for medicine might also end up buying a gun too. Besides, he’s getting a reputation of ripping people off, so we need to be prepared for the possible day for when people start coming to us to buy their guns instead.”\n\nDaniel nods and says nothing else. He isn’t really much of a talker or a thinker for that matter. Not that the boy is stupid, its just he focuses on other things. Like fixing. Sometimes he reminds you a bit of your older brother’s son from the old days. That boy was definitely a savant.\n\nDaniel head back to his workstation. You’re so glad you’ve never had problems with him, though Roger thinks he should mix more with people…but then you remember your own isolationist days in a certain basement and laugh to yourself.\n\nCompared to you back then, Daniel is a social butterfly and has an actual trade. He’ll be fine.\n\nReally its odd to you sometimes that you basically run the equivalent of a post apocalyptic general store, but as this place got bigger and better fortified, the original people began to rise in status and responsibility and here you are.\n\nIt certainly is better than being a wanderer out there. You’ve heard the tales and have no desire to leave the walls of New Security. Its safe here and you have everything you’d ever want.\n\nIt’s your new basement.\n\nYou remember Roger wanting to lead the New Security recon team when it was formed, but you managed to talk him out of that nonsense. You didn’t talk him into staying here in the first place and avoid getting nuked to atoms just so he could go play wasteland warrior and get his head blown off that way.\n\nHis job as lead protector of New Security holds more than enough danger and a test of his skills.\n\n“Hey mom, how’s business?” Cindy asks walking in.\n“Fine. I’m guessing you went with your father today?”\n“Yep. It was really cool. I got to learn how to shoot. I even killed something!”\n“What?” you ask.\n\nAt this point Roger walks in and has heard the end of the conversation.\n\n“It wasn’t a person and she wasn’t in any danger. It was just a large rat that had wandered on the range. She got it in right in the head on one shot. She’s a natural.” Roger says in an effort to reassure you.\n\nYou know it’s a harsh new world now, and you know your daughter learning how to shoot is probably one of the best things for her, but you can’t help worry.\n\n“Well, glad to hear you had fun.” You say.\n“Yeah! I even got to see the New Security Scout Team coming in from a mission! They said they had to fight a mutant! Sounded exciting! I can’t wait to be able to become one of them one day!”\n\nWell now you’re worried and Roger already knows it.\n\n“Uh, Cindy why don’t you go into the back, I’m sure we’ll all be eating soon.” Roger says. Cindy complies, but she knows all too well an argument is going to be occurring soon.\n\nYou give Roger that “look” that he knows all to well is one of displeasure.\n\n“Suzy, before you even start I really did not put that idea into her head! I didn’t even know the scout team was coming back today! Let alone that she was going to bump into them.”\n“You’re the head protector! How would you not know that?!” you say.\n“Hey, I take care of internal safety first. Besides, sometimes the scouts come back early if they don’t find anything out there.”\n“A mutant sounds like something to me. Look I know Cindy’s a teenager and I know she finds all this military type stuff exciting, but I’d at least rather not encourage her desire to want to go traipsing about the wasteland.”\n“Well I’d rather her be safe too, I mean that’s why I’m trying to teach her how to shoot and other skills. I mean we can only guide so much and eventually she’s going to be an adult and we won’t have any control over what she does. You know that.”\n\nThis is an old argument and Roger is right, but you really wish he wasn’t.\n\n“I know. I know. Just…(sigh) could you at least next time emphasize that being a scout isn’t as glamorous as it sounds?”\n“That I can do. Can’t promise you it’ll work, but I’ll definitely do that.”\n“Well that’s the best I can hope for.”\n\nRoger moves in to kiss you and you return it.\n\n“Besides, I don’t see why SHE gets to be in the scout team when I’m not a allowed to.” Roger says with a smile.\n\nYou laugh and you close up the store so that you can spend time with your family.\n\nIt’s not the easiest life, but it’s more than you ever had before.\n",
  "page 30": "SATURDAY\n\n\nYou wake up to a body grinding up against you, an arm holding you tightly around your mid-section and warm breath blowing in your ear in between the kissing.\n\nNot exactly what you expected, but it beats those Ground Zero advertisements.\n\n“Well, looks like someone is feeling friendly this morning. When did you get here?” You ask.\n“A little after midnight. It was boring and I would’ve rather been with you, but at least I didn’t see any of those things. You of course were already asleep so I just slept besides you the whole night. You’re a pretty sound sleeper, you didn’t even wake up.” Roger says.\n“Hrm. Surprised you didn’t take advantage of my vulnerable situation.”\n“I thought about it, but honestly by that time I was pretty tired myself. I actually haven’t been awake long. So they make you a waitress to help out around here?”\n“Oh. This? No. They were just good enough to let me borrow some clean clothes. I won’t say everyone here has been social with me, but at least nobody has been hostile.”\n“Hm. Well you look hot in that uniform.” Roger says and resumes groping you.\n“Oh? You like this? Got a role play fetish eh?”\n“Sure, and its short so I’ll be able to hike the skirt up for easy access.”\n“Well that definitely is the practical side to it.” You chuckle.\n\nYour laughter is turned to semi-surprise when Roger moves one of his hands under your skirt. You didn’t quite expect him to go there so quickly, but it isn’t unwelcome.\n\n“Mmm yeah…”\n\nIt’s been like a whole week that you’ve gone without pleasuring yourself (let alone had anyone else do it) so as far as you’re concerned you’re about due.\n\nYou quickly start to undo Roger’s pants and few moments later your legs are wrapped around him and he’s thrusting into you.\n\n“Oh shit this feels so fucking good…” you exclaim.\n\nHonestly that’s not all you say. You say quite a few things fairly loudly and you don’t really care if anyone hears you. (Roger on the other hand is a bit more on the quiet side)\n\nYou don’t know how much time passes because you’re enjoying yourself so much and then you feel it.\n\n“Oh my God! I’m almost there! Keep doing that! Harder! Faster! Oh yessss…” you exclaim and then the explosion.\n\nThough not that one.\n\nThere’s a loud noise and a faint rumble, but you don’t really pay it any mind because you and Roger are more focused on the task involving each other’s fun parts.\n\nA few moments later and someone starts banging on the door. At first you think its someone that’s complaining about you being too noisy, but they start yelling you two need to come out now.\n\n“There’s a fucking nuke going off in distance!” the voice yells.\n“What the fuck?!” Roger exclaims.\n“What?!” You say.\n“I said there’s a…”\n“Yeah I heard! (Sigh) Hold on.” Roger interrupts.\n\nThat must’ve been the rumble and noise from earlier. Talk about a mood breaker.\n\n“So…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“I guess so. Shit…I hope it wasn’t too close.” Roger says.\n“We’d be all vaporized if it was a big one, so maybe it was just a little one?”\n“The one they dropped on Hiroshima was a little one too.”\n“Well I suppose there’s not much for it now. Our building is still intact so that’s a good sign.” You say trying not to wonder if you’re still going to be in the range of a fatal dose of radiation.\n\nRoger starts to slowly get his pants back on and you pull your skirt back down.\n\nWhen you both leave the room, you see Jasmine trying to calm her children down. A couple people are arguing. A few are just sitting in a silent state of shock. Henry is actually outside the diner looking in the direction of where the bomb must’ve gone off. You can see the lingering remnants of a mushroom cloud in the far distance even from inside the diner. You can’t help but hold on the Roger a bit tightly.\n\n“I don’t exactly know how far or how big the bomb was, but I do know it went off in the direction of Fort Timons. Hell, that might’ve even been the target. Well either that or the city. Either way both of those places are probably radioactive ruins now and it looks like you saved my life too.” Roger says squeezing you around the waist.\n“You think maybe this was just a way to get rid of those infected people? Maybe this is only occurring on a small scale?” you ask.\n“I dunno. Maybe, but I get the impression this bomb was just one of many to the nuclear end of the big war that the Ground Zero ads kept going on about. Guess it doesn’t matter because I imagine things are going to be severely changing and the world as we once knew it is going to be much different. Harder for one thing.”\n\nSurprisingly as frightening as this event is, you aren’t as filled with dread as you normally would be. Maybe its because after all the other craziness you went through this week, you could’ve ended up a lot worse off. Maybe you’re finally trying to find the silver lining for once in your life.\n\n“We’ll handle it…together.” You say with certainty.\n\nRoger looks at you and nods.\n\n“We will.”\n\nAt this point Henry steps back in the diner and after calming some of the arguing truckers. He begins addressing the situation and stating that nothing has changed and that the situation is still the same, namely if people help, then they are welcome to stay. If not or if they don’t want to stay then they are free to go.\n\nA couple of the truckers who apparently have families elsewhere do leave. Everyone else stays and the work towards creating a permanent new “home” is begun.\n\nWhile you’re pitching in by doing inventory on the medical supplies you have you briefly wonder what would’ve happened had you not abandoned the carnival when you did. Could you have made a difference had you stayed like Roofie wanted you to?\n\nYou shake your head. You don’t mind helping out, but you know you’re no leader. Better to be safe and be around a group that you at least feel more comfortable around and so far that’s what you’ve encountered here at this truck stop. Most people here despite the highly stressful situation have still been pleasant with you.\n\nFunny where one finds a place to belong.\n",
  "page 43": "You’re so tired, you don’t want to be bothered with stairs right now. You collapse on the nearby sofa and close your eyes.\n\n“Try to keep it down please.” You say.\n\nEveryone agrees, but the act of moving bodies out isn’t exactly quiet work. Especially when they try to move the farmer’s wife, which even with Lifto helping, isn’t an easy task.\n\n“Damnit Fatty get her fucking leg, I’m losing my grip.” Lifto says.\n“This bitch is bigger than me! I’m having a coronary just trying to move her.” Fatty replies.\n“Don’t look at me, I’m doing the best I can with this leg, we should just drag her out.” Shrimpy adds.\n“Okay, okay, drop her.”\n\nA loud thud of a dead body hitting the floor fills your ears.\n\nThem trying to drag her doesn’t go too much quieter, Fatty ends up knocking over a table lamp and at this point you know trying to sleep on the sofa is a losing proposition.\n\nYou don’t get mad since it really isn’t their fault, but you do get up in silence and make your way up the stairs.\n\nReally you’re still a bit wobbly from your tiredness and your eyes are half sleepy, but thanks to the railings, you’re able to maneuver yourself to the top without falling.\n\nUnfortunately, that isn’t the danger.\n\nWhen you get to the top of the stairs, you see a young woman standing before you holding a knife. It looks like she was sneaking to one of the other rooms when you appeared.\n\nThe woman is a bit surprised when she sees you and you’re just barely awake enough to realize that you’re in danger, you’re not quite awake enough to react in time.\n\nWith a short rush towards you she stabs you in the right tit, causing you to fall backwards. The knife wound wouldn’t have killed you since it didn’t hit vital organs, but breaking your neck falling down the stairs sure does.\n\nThe rest of your friends come running back inside from the noise and will probably avenge your death, but obviously you won’t be alive to thank them.\n",
  "page 46": "Karnival of Karnage\n\n\nThe Future…\n\nYou sit comfortably in your modified jeep watching yet another small settlement burn before you. Not the first time, and certainly won’t be the last. The screams and gunfire are starting to die down which means today’s raid is nearly over.\n\nStill, it isn’t completely over yet and there’s always something fun to see.\n\n“Woo hoo! Looks like that new recruit has got the right attitude!” you say watching a young man wearing an outlandish green wig and novelty nose glasses swing his machete into the skull of another young man who was previously begging for his life.\n“Hrm. Wasn’t too sure about him at first, but I guess he’s proven himself on this raid. Speaking of which, looks like we’ve made a good haul. Lots of food, water, even medical supplies.” Lifto remarks sitting next to you.\n“Wheeee! Gimme that map, I want to see where we should hit next.” You say.\n“I believe Captain Howdy has it.”\n“Well, call that pierced freak over here then.” You say.\n\nLifto nods and calls for Captain Howdy via bullhorn. Eventually a heavily pierced man wearing a beat up pilot’s cap, black face make up and carrying an assault rifle over his shoulder appears.\n\n“Black face today? Isn’t that a bit unPC?” you say with a smirk.\n“Eh, fuck’em if they can’t take a joke.” Howdy says apathetically.\n“Truer words my friend. Lifto says you’ve got the map of this area.” You say.\n“Oh yeah, I do. Here let me get it out of my pack.”\n\nHowdy takes off a small backpack and opens it up to give you a well-worn map of the area.\n\n“Let’s see…okay…we hit that place…and that one…” you start to say looking for a new target.\n“How about Redemption? I hate those religious types.” Howdy says.\n“While I have no doubt that town of pious zealots is well stocked, they’re also very well armed. In fact I’ve been hearing rumors that they’ve been launching their own little crusade against neighboring settlements.” You say.\n“I heard that they went complete Spanish Inquisition on one town. Crucified most of them and burned the rest alive. That was of course after they already had tortured the shit out of all of them.” Lifto adds.\n“So? We could take those assholes.” Howdy remarks.\n“That may be, but not in the near future. It would be a very dangerous undertaking and we are not doing this for the risks and to prove how badass we are. We’re doing this for survival…well that and to have a little fun in the process.” You say with a smile, though Howdy is still one of your more “macho” members and still wants to prove he’s got a dick by killing something.\n\nYou reach out to his face with a gentle touch and soothing voice.\n\n“I know you like to kill things, but I don’t want you to get killed in the process. Just because we tend to pick easier targets just means I really don’t want you or any one of us to get killed. We’re all family and I don’t want to see any one of you die, you understand? That’s why our mode of operation is to go for low risk, high reward and I’d say its work for all these years wouldn’t you?”\n“Yes, I suppose it has.” Howdy says.\n“That’s right. Anyway it’s looking like we have hit every place that’s worthwhile around here. We should start heading east and raid merchant caravans coming out of those city-states. They’re all fucked up after that big war they had with the Ground Zero Corporation so they’re lacking in the defense department now. Okay, let’s start shutting down this circus and move on.” You say and take the bullhorn from Lifto.\n\n“Alright you clowns gather up all the shit we’ve looted, pile it in the vehicles and let’s get this freak show on the road! We’re heading east! Flammo! HEY! That doesn’t mean start another goddamn fire, it means let’s go!” you shout shaking your head and throw the bullhorn in the back seat.\n\nLifto starts up the jeep and you stretch a bit waiting for your family to finish packing up. Lifto waits in silence, but you feel like talking.\n\n“A Pennywise for your thoughts.” You say which causes a snort from Lifto.\n“Oh nothing, I suppose I was just thinking about how much things have changed. The past. Sometimes I miss it.”\n“Oh that. Well I don’t miss it. Glad that part of my life is over.”\n“Not just the old days, but people as well like Fatty, Shrimpy… Klepto.”\n“Well that’s different. I do miss them. They were family and I’ll never forget them. We sure had some fun times back at that farmhouse remember?”\n“Heh, yeah. Shame what happened; maybe we could’ve made a more stable life there rather than doing this raider thing.”\n“Perhaps, but we can’t dwell on what if in the past. Just have to focus on today and if possible, the future. That’s what’s kept us alive and allowed us to build our new family.” You say and touch Lifto’s hand.\n\nLifto looks and smiles at you. You aren’t sure if he’s ever completely agreed with how you’ve gone about things, but he loves you enough that he’ll stand by your side no matter what and that’s enough for you.\n\nTo be honest you did latch on to Lifto a bit in the beginning because he was obviously a big guy that could definitely protect you in a time of trouble, but it’s a bit more than that now. Given that you’re both the only two left from the original group, your ties have naturally grown quite a bit.\n\nYou’ve done a lot of bad things since your new life began, but it’s a harsh world and you’re just living in it. Sometimes you have bouts where you wonder if you should feel bad about doing the things you do, but then you just laugh and remember to not dwell on the past.\n\n“I love you Kenneth.” You say using Lifto’s real name, looking at him and touching his hand.\n“I love you Suzy.” He replies back and leans over to kiss you.\n\nWith this exchange of affection, you, Lifto and your gang of clowns drive off in search of new prey.\n",
  "page 45": "SATURDAY\n\n\n“Suzy? You up?” Shrimpy asks and knocks on your door.\n\nNormally you wouldn’t be this early, but in this rare instance you actually are.\n\n“Yeah, I’m awake. I’ll be ready in a moment.” You say applying make up on your face.\n“Okay, we’re all about as ready as we’re going to be, Lifto and Fatty have already put Klepto’s body in the hole we dug, so we’re all about as ready for this thing as we’re going to be. See you downstairs.”\n“Hey Shrimpy can I say a few things at this event?” you ask before he walks away from the door.\n“You mean like a eulogy? Sure I mean if you’ve got something to say then by all means go for it. Really we were all trying to come up with something formal, but I think we’re all still a little exhausted. Lifto actually broke down in tears yesterday about Klepto’s death. I think he’s upset that he tried to kill him just the day before and wishes their last moments were on friendlier terms.”\n“Well, tell Lifto that the time for tears and regrets will soon be a thing of the past. I’m almost done, see you downstairs.”\n“All right.”\n\nYou look at yourself in the mirror and finish applying lipstick. Not the exact shade of red you wanted, but it was the only lipstick that the previous owner hadn’t used yet. You’re just glad the girl had as much make up as she did so you could paint up your face proper.\n\nSatisfied with your face, you stand up and look at yourself in the nearby full length mirror.\n\n“Well it’s not my old carnival outfit, but yeah… this is definitely me now. Now and forever.” you say and walk towards the door.\n\nBefore leaving you stop and look towards the closet.\n\n“Thank you for letting me borrow your make up and clothing.” You say and then giggle a bit.\n\nYou skip down the stairs and meet up with the rest. They’re all a bit more somber than you and are quite surprised to see your slightly energetic temperament.\n\n“Suzy? That’s a uh interesting outfit.” Fatty remarks.\n“Isn’t it though? Made it myself. Nothing like a new set of clothes to put you in a different mindset! In fact given that all of you have been running around in the same clothes for day on end, I’d say that all of you could use new clothes too. Those rags must be really filthy by now; you’ll all probably feel a lot more positive about things once you change. I’m sure we can gather up enough of this family of deadnecks’ clothing and I can make you all something. Anyway, we can talk about this later let us be on our way.”\n\nEveryone is a unsure of how to react to your new chipperish behavior especially given the circumstances, but they all just lead the way to Klepto’s open grave which has been dug out in the backyard of the house.\n\nKlepto still looks about as dead as he did that last time you saw him, though someone has arranged his body in a respectful way. He even has some freshly pulled flowers in his hand.\n\n“The flowers are a nice touch.” You remark not knowing who did it.\n“Thank you.” Lifto says wiping away a tear.\n“Shrimpy probably told you all that I was going to do a bit of a eulogy, but does anyone have anything else to say?”\n“No, we were all trading Klepto stories last night. We’ll probably be doing it for a while. None of us are really good for formal speeches though, probably best if you do it. Besides, it means a lot that you want to do it despite not knowing any of us that long.” Shrimpy says.\n“Glad you feel that way because what I’m going to say is going to be towards all of you…”\n\nAnd before you can finish that thought. Your eyes (and everyone else’s) catch sight of something quite spectacular in the distance.\n\nA mushroom cloud.\n\nYou’re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn’t engulfed you, so you’re guessing that it wasn’t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one. Still, you can’t help but wonder if you’re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though. If so there isn’t much that can done about it.\n\n“Well I’ll be damned, the world finally went and did it…” you say to yourself.\n\nLifto, Fatty and Shrimpy all at the same time begin to swear and react to the situation as most people would, namely panic, fear and hysteria. You think in the old days you probably would have too, but not anymore. If anything this is excellent timing for your new outlook on life.\n\nYou quickly call everyone to attention.\n\n“Hey! Listen up! This might be the end of civilization as we know it, but it isn’t the end of the world! Sure life is going to be harder now, but look at we’ve already survived. Just this damn week we suffered through a military occupation, an internal civil war, an attack by freaks, and took down a bunch of rednecks trying to murder us.”\n\nAt this point they’re all listening to you intently.\n“We’ll survive this and as long as we stick together there isn’t anything we can’t do. This is a new beginning and it’ll be us against the world if necessary. We are a family and I love you guys.” You say.\n\nThese words are met with a pause and then of course positive approval by all and everyone goes in for a bit of a group hug. Feelings run a bit high and some more tears are shed.\n\nWhile your words are genuine and do have feeling behind them, but your mind is still in a dark place. You do see them all as family, but you also can’t help see them as useful “tools” in the chaos that’s going to come. Even now you’re sizing them all up on their weaknesses and strengths.\n\nIn any case, you and everyone finish up by completing the burial of Klepto and gathering all the supplies from the farm that will be needed. You all know you’ll run out eventually, but for now you’ve got enough supplies to ponder a long range plan of your future.\n\nNo longer are you the shy “good” girl who hid away in the basement, harassed by your family and living as one day blurred into the next. Far from it. Very far from it.\n\nIt’s a brand new day and this is just the beginning of your brand new life.\n",
  "page 48": "FRIDAY\n\n\n“Hey fearless leader, wake up, your people demand it.” Shrimpy says tapping you on the shoulder.\n\nGroggily you sit up, you swear you feel like you’ve barely gotten any sleep at all. Shrimpy stands nearby along with Klepto, the dwarf woman who “endorsed” you yesterday and a wiry scraggily looking man. You think he runs one of those carny games…specifically the one where you shoot a water gun at a clown’s mouth.\n\n“What’s going on?” you ask.\n“What’s going on is a bunch of shit, that’s what darling. After the midgets here…”\n“Fuck you Jack, we’re DWARVES.” The dwarf woman interrupts.\n“Whatever Dolores. Anyway after the…little people rounded up all the military supplies last night I got one of their radios tuned in to other military frequencies. Turns out that the nearby town has been overrun with those things we killed yesterday. The poor bastard that I spoke to just before it sounded like he got his guts ripped out said they don’t know whether it was a virus or not., just that there were a shitload of them. Either way I say we got lucky that only a few wandered out this far. We need to get the fuck outta here.”\n“My town…wow…uh…” you say being surprised by this revelation. You really are at a loss for words right now. You start to think about your real family and even Bobby. Are they okay? Are they already dead? Are they one of those things?\n\n“Suzy? You okay? You’re spacing out.” Klepto says.\n“Huh, yeah, I’m just…okay yeah we obviously need to get out of here. Start packing up the rest of our stuff and…”\n“Sweetheart didn’t you hear what I said? I said there’s probably fucking crazed cannibals on their way here right fucking now! We ain’t got time for that shit! We need to just load up as much supplies we can and take off in our vehicles. This is the fucking end times man!” Jack says.\n“It’s not going to take that much longer to pack down, we had most of the stuff ready to go before the National Guard arrived. Some of our people are still wounded badly and need the rest as well. Besides, living in our trailers is going to be a lot more desirable than living in just a regular vehicle if there is a complete collapse of society going on right now.” Shrimpy remarks.\n“Okay then Tom Thumb YOU and the rest of the lollipop kids do it. Me and some of the others? We’re taking supplies and leaving. Not stayin’ around here waiting to be cannibal chow.”\n\nYou’ve been in charge for less than one full day and already someone is threatening to break away and worse, not even taking any notice of you. You just bludgeoned crazed freaks to death yesterday, you’re tired of not being taken seriously.\n\n“Jack, if you or others want to leave you’re free to do so, but what you’re not doing is taking any of those military supplies from here. Those belong to the carnival and as such belong to all of us. Now if you don’t want any part of that any longer, lots of luck, but you and anyone else that wants to leave you go with what personal items you came with.”\n“Pfft, whatever. I didn’t elect you as leader. I’m only telling you as a courtesy, you can stay here and get eaten or come along and I can keep you safe. In fact to pass the time we can play shoot the clown in the mouth, except it won’t be water going in your mouth, it’ll be my…”\n\nJack isn’t expecting you to kick him in the balls. The moment you do he winces and crumples. You follow up with a knee to his face. He’s down and you have everyone’s attention in the tent.\n\n“That’s the last fucking blow job reference I’m going to hear from you or ANYONE else for that matter. Now listen up, as I remember most of you were fine with me being in charge yesterday and goddamn it that’s what I’m going to do, be in fucking charge. This is STILL our carnival, that hasn’t changed and I’m not going to let it fall apart just because the rest of society seems to be. Now this is what we’re going to do, we’re going to finish packing up our shit, get our trailers and such in order, we’re going to also take the military trucks and then we’re going to move on. Now if some of those geeks show up well we’ve got some brand new rifles and pistols to try them out on. Anyone who doesn’t like this plan can leave with the shirts on their back and nothing else! Now let’s stop fighting and get some of this damn shit done!”\n\nAt this point those that are in condition to work, proceed to do so.\n\n“What about him?” Shrimpy asks pointing at Jack who is still on the ground.\n“Throw his ass out, he made his decision.” You remark and then notice Dolores smiling.\n“What’re you smiling about?” you demand.\n“Nothing, but I’m beginning to like you, blondie.” Dolores says and then whistles over several dwarves who promptly pick up Jack and haul him away. Dolores then leaves to go tend to other matters. Shrimpy says he’s going to go help and leaves as well, leaving you alone with Klepto.\n\n“Well, looks like you underwent quite a change while I was knocked out yesterday. I like it. Assertiveness is an attractive trait on you.”\n“Klepto, I’ve got a lot on my mind and I’m in no mood for your nice guy trying to get into my pants routine right now.” You say.\n“Okay, okay, sheesh, I’m just…nevermind…fuck I’ll just leave you alone ringmaster.” Klepto says and walks off.\n\nYou can’t worry about Klepto’s fragile ego right now, you’ve got bigger concerns and that’s on top of still thinking about your “old” family. You know you made the decision to leave them all, but that was still just a few days ago and you still never wanted any of them to suffer at the hands of whatever the hell those things are.\n\nSpeaking of which you still have to worry about those geeks. Jack might’ve been out of line, but he still might’ve been correct about some wandering towards the carnival like those yesterday did. Considering the dwarves still seem to be the largest faction and friendliest toward you, you have some of them armed with the rifles to stand on top of the trailers and keep a look out. You keep yourself busy by helping with the clean up.\n\nHours pass and that’s when your lookouts see something approaching. Not the geeks, but rather a few pick up trucks which look like they’re holding several men carrying shotguns and rifles. You call everyone to immediately take a defensive position and to fall back.\n\nYou aren’t sure what to expect, but a bunch of heavily armed men can’t ever be a good thing. Unfortunately as leader, you’re going to have to be the one to handle this visit, hopefully peacefully if you can.\n\nAs the pick up trucks stop, you stand several feet away with your “snipers” keep a bead on your visitors. You hang on to your own rifle and several other carnies do likewise. One of the men gets out one of the trucks with his hands up. Looks like a redneck, in fact you imagine this lot are from the trailer park a few miles down the road.\n\n“It’s okay, it’s okay li’l lady, I see yer guys up there. Ain’t nobody lookin’ for a fight.” He says.\n“Doesn’t look that way, given that you’ve come with three trucks full of armed men and don’t tell me its hunting season.” You say.\n“Heh, well I’m sure given your own heightened state of awareness, you know things are getting’ dangerous nowadays. Anyway my name’s Mel, I’m guessin’ since you’re the one talkin’ you’re in charge here. Ringmaster or something like that?”\n“Something exactly like that.” you say.\n“Okay. You…uh…got some military gear here too I see. That truck over there.”\n“Yeah, what of it?”\n“Oh nothing, but that brings about the question of where are the guardsmen…heh yeah they tried to tell us what to do too. Didn’t work out so well. The second amendment says you got the right to pack it after all. Government can’t just do what they want.”\n\nAt this point more of Mel’s men get out of their trucks as well. Your people and Mel’s people are both starting to eye each other waiting for someone to fire a shot.\n\n“Look let me cut to the chase honey. I’m assumin’ you might know by now what’s been happenin’ back in town. Besides the government tryin’ to pull their shit, there’s a bunch of freaks runnin’ around tryin’ to eat people. A bunch of them attacked us last night and while we fought them off, some of us got badly hurt and are in need of medical supplies. Now of course we did try goin’ into town first, but was just too fucked up there an’ we didn’t make much head way what with the freaks AND the guard all over the damn place. Then it occurred to me today that your circus might still be around and the National Guard probably would’ve been here as well so we decided to investigate. Now the group of weekend warriors at the trailer park had shit for medical supplies. So I’m hoping your detachment had more in that department.”\n\nMel looks up at your dwarves upon the trailers.\n\n“Now you might get a few of us, but I’m bettin, most of us are better shots than y’all, so if you give us what medicine supplies you do have we’ll leave here in peace, if not well…”\n\nAt this point things could get very violent very quickly.\n",
  "page 49": "You let these assholes come in and take medical supplies and they won’t stop there. After all you’ve been through you’re not putting up with MORE people not taking you seriously.\n\n“FIRE!” you shout and run back for cover as your people do just that. Naturally the trailer park crew do the same as their own leader runs for cover too.\n\nYou’ve never shot at a human before, but you do remember when your brother Ben tried to show you how to shoot once. You weren’t very good at it then, and you’re not very good at it now, and sadly neither are a lot of your people.\n\nSeveral carnies get killed in the ensuing gun battle and many more get hit. While your own side does score a few hits of its own, Mel wasn’t bluffing when he said his people were better shots. It’s actually amazing that you come through unscathed, though that might be because Klepto in his foolish attempt to play hero gets fatality shot when trying to shield you.\n\nThe only thing that prevents the rednecks from completely overrunning you is one of the jugglers lobs one of the few grenades that were acquired from the military with fairly good accuracy, blowing up two of their trucks (and some of them) and giving the survivors enough pause to understand that a continued attack is not in their best interest.\n\nMel and the rest quickly pile into the surviving truck and drive away. You’ve won, but at a high cost. The carnies have already suffered losses and wounded with the recent internal struggle. Those that aren’t wounded or dead are now experiencing a mixture of sorrow, rage and loss of hope.\n\n“Well what now fearless leader?! We got even more dead and wounded thanks to your leadership!” Dolores exclaims.\n“Would it have been better if I just let them come in a take all our shit?!” you snap.\n“It would’ve been better had we not got all our asses shot off! If it hadn’t been for Zackary throwing a grenade we’d probably all be worm food!”\n“And how the hell is that my fault?! I was shooting at those hillbillies right along the rest of you! I didn’t see YOU hitting any of them!”\n\nWhile you and Dolores continue to argue Shrimpy steps in to try to mediate.\n\n“Hey we don’t have time for all this infighting! Haven’t we had enough of that shit? Now we survived and that’s the most important thing. I say we continue with our original plan and get the fuck outta here, in fact I think we should just pack up and go RIGHT NOW. Those rednecks aren’t going to just take this loss, they’re going to come back in force.”\n“Are you kidding me? You want us to just turn tail and run after this? We need to get revenge!”\n“Dolores, we already got several wounded people who are in no condition to fight! Never mind the amount of dead! We have no idea how many of those gun toting rednecks there are or even how much weaponry they have!” Shrimpy says.\n“Most likely a lot and that’s not even counting whatever they got from the military.” You add.\n\nDolores isn’t deterred however, she’s just angrier specifically at you.\n\n“Are you…(Sigh) can’t believe I supported you as a leader, must’ve been the goddamn blood loss from my head wound after the carnival fight. Look, now maybe this gunfight was a cluster fuck and that’s why I’m pissed, but I suppose in the scheme of things you at least stood up to these bastards. If we hit them now, they probably won’t even expect it, and you heard their leader, he said they had a lot of wounded of their own, so how many of them could there really be?”\n\nDolores exhales and now gives you an even more glaring look, which you didn’t think was possible.\n\n“However, your plan is to just run off and not avenge our fallen then maybe you need to get the fuck outta the way and hit the road like you told us to do with Jack not too long ago. Suzy, if YOU want to continue running this carnival YOU better do the right thing. ”\n\nDolores’ intentions are obvious and clear. She’s going to go take revenge no matter what. What isn’t quite obvious is if she’s going to have the support. There are probably some that will support her, but several more are likely to not want to do any more fighting.\n",
  "page 40": "You might not know where you’re going to go, but staying around here seems like it will definitely lead to more death, namely yours.\n\n“Guys, I’m making a run for it. I can’t do this.”\n“Suzy, that asshole killed Klepto! We can’t just let these rednecks get away with that!” Lifto says.\n“And they shot me in the ass!” Fatty adds.\n“And I killed one of them, granted it was an accident, but that’s probably why they’re shooting at us! They aren’t completely at fault for thinking we’re here to hurt them. In fact they’re completely correct in that assessment given that you all want to get revenge. Look, I’m getting the hell out of here, and I hope the rest of you are with me on this. It sucks what happened to Klepto, but if we stay here, we’re going to end up like he did!” you exclaim.\n\nLifto and Fatty are both unmoved by your words and tell you quite colorfully how disappointed they are in you. Shrimpy however is silent, and then passes his assault rifle to Lifto.\n\n“Here. At least lay down a bit of covering fire while we run for it.” Shrimpy says.\n“You’re… you’re leaving? Wow…Shrimpy. I could’ve understood if you had stuck with the rest of the dwarves back at the carnival, but looks like you were just following Suzy’s ass the whole time.” Lifto remarks.\n“Think whatever you want. Just cover us.”\n“Fine. But given everything we’ve been through, I’m starting to think this girl is a fucking jinx and following her is just going to get you killed.” Lifto remarks.\n“Well then you should be successful in blasting those farmers then, you ready or not?”\n\nLifto reloads the rifle and without another word begins firing on the farmhouse. You and Shrimpy both sprint away from the truck as fast as you can hoping that you don’t get hit.\n\nFortunately it seems that the farmer is focusing on the immediate threat, which is Lifto. You don’t look back you just continue running and try to keep as low as possible.\n\nEventually you get yourself lost in some high grass. You hear someone still running close behind.\n\n“Shrimpy?”\n“Yeah, its me. (Whew) I think we’re far enough now. Hold on, (pant) let me catch up to you. Damn grass is too high for me.” you hear him say.\n“Follow my voice. Wait, I can hear you, let me just…” you begin to say and turn around to walk in the direction of his voice.\n\nUnfortunately you don’t notice the bear trap on the ground. You must’ve just missed it when you ran this way before, but you don’t miss it this time.\n\nThe device springs and your left leg is suddenly crushed by a forty pound snapping jaw made of metal. Your leg is most certainly broken, and you are most certainly in more pain than you could ever imagine.\n\nBefore you start to go into shock from the pain, you scream loud enough that Shrimpy definitely hears you and runs in your direction.\n\n“Oh my god, oh Suzy, oh shit!” he exclaims.\n“I…I…(sob) I…(sob)” you can’t even form a coherent sentence; you’re on the verge of passing out and crying uncontrollably.\n\nShrimpy attempts to pull the trap open, but he isn’t quite strong enough and just causes you more agony.\n\n“NO! (sob) Just…(sob) I…(sob)” you cry out.\n“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’ll get help! Just hang on!” Shrimpy says and runs back in the direction of the farmhouse.\n\nYou don’t stop him and between the crying and wishing that you never left the basement you soon fall unconscious from shock and pain.\n\nYou don’t know how long you’re out for, but when you come to, you wish you hadn’t.\n\n“Knew it would be a good idea to lay dem traps out here. Never know who might be sneakin’ through this tall grass.” You see a large man in overalls carrying a shotgun say as he prods you with the barrel of the weapon.\n\n“Please…help…” is all you can utter.\n\n“Help? Like you and your evil clown friends helped each other in killing my boy and tryin’ to kill the rest of my family? I dunno what sort of fucked up psychos y’all are, but you messed with the wrong family this day. Say hi to your friends in clown hell, bitch.”\n\nYou weakly put your hands in front of your face and then the farmer pulls the trigger.\n",
  "page 42": "Given that everyone is going to be making a bunch of noise, moving bodies and such downstairs, you decide to head upstairs. You think you could really use the solitude anyway. You think you’ve spent more time in the close company of people this week than you have in your entire life and that includes when you had a boyfriend.\n\nWith everyone else doing a bit of cleaning up, your mind goes a bit numb as you go up the creaky stairs. You put everything that you’ve experienced this week out of your head. All you want to think about right now is resting from this ordeal.\n\nYou reach the landing and look to your left and see a room which is fairly messy to the point of being disgusting. You hear flies buzzing in there and it smells like something died in there, which doesn’t improve how you’re already feeling. You guess that this was probably the son’s room. You close the door so as to keep the odor in and move on.\n\nAcross the hall you find a much better room with a big bed. You guess that Clem and his wife slept here, or maybe just his wife, given her size. Unfortunately that smell from Junior’s room is still strong enough for this room to catch a bit of the fallout. You can’t rest here either so you move on again.\n\nYou pass another bathroom and then at the far end you find another bedroom. This one is free of a bad smell and has a comfortable looking bed so you immediately go to it.\n\nYou collapse on the bed, with a deep exhale. You lie there in silence for a moment trying to wrap your mind around the situation.\n\n“(Sigh) Ohhhh…shit…never should’ve left the basement.” You say.\n\nYou think about what might’ve happened had you actually stayed home earlier this week rather than going with the idea to go join the circus. You also wonder what would’ve happened had you gone to live with your younger sister or even made up with Bobby. You then remember of how the National Guard were stationed in your town and then there were those creatures (Still don’t know what that was all about or if Lifto is out of the woods as far as that’s concerned) so chances are things might’ve still turned out hectic.\n\n“I was fucked no matter what.” You laugh as your eyes start to close a bit. In fact you laugh quite a bit. You laugh at this entire hell week.\n\nIt may be your mind trying to cope and a combination of being tired, or you may have snapped a little but in any event you can’t stop quietly giggling to yourself.\n\nAnd then as you’re in your minor giggling fit, your eyes stay open longer when you begin to realize your surroundings.\n\nThis room. This is the room of a young female. There is a whole area dedicated to make up and such. The walls have a flowery print. You even see a few feminine undergarments sitting on top of a dresser.\n\nYou then remember back when you first shot Junior, his mother telling him that he had better not be fighting with his sister again. Funny what you remember during intense situations.\n\nThere were only three dead bodies, which means the daughter of this family is still alive and possibly hiding somewhere. Fatty said he searched upstairs, but he could’ve missed something.\n\nAnd a quick glance to your left you see a closet door slightly askew, which then begins to open further.\n\nFeeling a sudden burst of energy brought on by danger, you manage to sit up and get off the bed just in time for the owner of this room to reveal herself. Apparently she thought you were going to be easier pickings than Fatty, she finds out how dreadfully wrong she is.\n\nYou immediately rush at the woman who holds a large knife in one hand. It’s enough to catch her off guard and she fails to hit you with the knife or rather fails to hit you in a meaningful way since the blade does slice your upper arm.\n\nThe pair of you fall to the closet floor where she slams her head against the wall. You grab the hand holding the knife and smash it on the doorway until she drops it. You feel a punch to your face by her other hand, but you ignore the pain and with all your weight you slam your elbow into her nose.\n\nYou stop her from crying out by following that up with a punch to her mouth. You repeatedly punch her in the face to a point where she temporarily stops resisting entirely. Clothing is falling on the pair of you and you grab a shirt and wrap it around her throat and pull tightly. Your mind goes into a very dark place.\n\n“Shhhh…it’ll all be over soon, just let the darkness take you” you whisper.\n\nThe woman gasps for air and tries to punch and scratch at you, but you manage to pull your head back just enough for her to miss. She tries to wiggle and squirm away, but you’re sitting right on her stomach and there’s nowhere for her to go. The woman continues to choke and tries to pry your hands away, but she’s unable to do so and her struggle becomes less intense.\n\n“…there we go…now you’ll be with your family forever…” you say and watch her face turn unhealthy shade due to lack of oxygen and her eyes roll up into her head.\n\nThe woman stops breathing and the deed is done. You don’t even feel tired anymore, it’s like killing her energized you or something. You don’t have the sick feeling either. You just went into a kind of trance. Like this woman was garbage that needed to be disposed of. You wonder if this is what your Uncle Ed felt when he killed whores.\n\nIf you were in your old frame of mind, you’d know how fucked up that is. In your current state of mind you still know how fucked up that is, however you no longer care.\n\nSomething may very well have snapped within you, whether it was a combination of the entire week, or just this one bad day, the damage has been done and you’re not quite the same person that you were anymore. She was going to kill you and you stopped her from doing so, that’s the important thing. Nothing else. You survived. There are no limits to what you’re capable of, you realize that now.\n\n“Suzy!? Hey are you okay up there?! I heard some noise!” you hear Lifto shout.\n“Yeah, I’m fine, just looking through a closet before I get some rest. Some shit fell, no worries!” you shout back.\n“Okay then.”\n\nWith that interruption out of the way you turn your attention back to your situation. You start looking around the room and find lots of make up. You also go through her clothing and notice a lot of it is about your size though a bit on the slutty side. Oddly enough after going through some more personal belongings you find out her name was Susie too. Or Susie Mae to be precise.\n\nAfter pulling out some of the clothing from the closet you shove the rest of Susie Mae\u0027s body into it and shut the door.\n\n“Hmm, yeah I think I could make a new outfit out of this stuff.” You remark. You then grab the scissors and sewing material that lies nearby. It’s been awhile since you’ve done any seamstress type stuff, but you remember when your mother taught you to do it when you were in your elementary school plays. Hopefully you’ve retained enough of the knowledge.\n\nYou spend the rest of the day in Susie Mae’s room on your own personal project. It’s the most solitude you’ve had in a long time and you happily enjoy it. The rest of your compatriots are busy searching the rest of the farm for the most part though at one point Shrimpy comes up and asks if you’re okay.\n\n“Suzy? Hey thought you’d be asleep…what are you doing?”\n“Well I don’t exactly have any extra clothes anymore. Even my clown stuff was left back at the carnival, so I’m making a new wardrobe, what’s up?” you ask not looking up from what you’re doing.\n“Um, well just wanted to let you know that we’ve checked out this entire farm and the place seems all clear and well stocked too.” Shrimpy remarks.\n“Are Fatty and Lifto okay?” you ask.\n“Heh, yeah Fatty’s fine, wasn’t fun digging that bullet out of his ass though. As for Lifto he seems fine too. Don’t think Klepto biting him did anything and he’s cleaned out the wound at this point so I guess he’s in the clear. Speaking of Klepto, we uh…were thinking we should at least bury him. We already dug the hole in a nice spot. Maybe we should have a small funeral tomorrow?”\n“I think that sounds like a fine idea…guess I better finish this thing if I’m attending a funeral.” You reply.\n\nShrimpy pauses for a moment.\n\n“Suzy are you really okay? You seem different somehow.”\n“I’m just fine Shrimpy. Just fine. I really need to focus on this though.”\n“Um, okay sure. We’ll let you know if anything important pops up.” Shrimpy says and leaves you.\n\nYou aren’t disturbed for the rest of the day or night; in fact they all must sleep downstairs which gives you free reign of the upstairs bathroom to wash up a bit.\n\nAfter washing up you try on your now finished project. Your outfit is a patchwork of colorful chaos since you just cut up lots of clothing and sewed bits of them together, but you’re pleased with your work. In fact you’re so pleased with it, you fall asleep in it figuring that it’ll save you a bit of time to get ready for Klepto’s funeral tomorrow.\n",
  "page 222": "And suddenly all your instincts cry out “DANGER.” You also remember Bobby telling you that you shouldn’t listen to William since he’s a shit stirrer and he’s certainly doing a good job here.\n\nWilliam seems too eager to help you given everything you’ve heard him spout about survival of the fittest and wanting to embrace pure chaos. Technically you still aren’t “family” and if you aren’t with Bobby, what’s stopping him from just gutting you and tossing your corpse along side the road or worse when you leave the compound? And that’s not even counting that creepy Aaron guy who is going to be travelling with him.\n\nEven if he is on the up and up, you have no idea where to go. Going back home isn’t really an option, in fact going back to town sounds like a bad idea all around given what Bobby told you yesterday. And you certainly don’t want to be travelling around with William while he raises hell, since again he’s libel to “raise hell” on you.\n\nYou still don’t know about the whole wedding sacrifice, but you do know that running away with William isn’t the answer. You’re going to just have to deal with your situation another way.\n\nYou take a deep breath and hand William his keys back.\n\n“I thank you for the offer William, but I’m staying.” You say.\n\nWilliam looks a little surprised at first, but then his face turns to a smile.\n\n“Well… Tiamat certainly sent a blessing to Bobby when he met you. I hope he realizes it.” William remarks.\n“If he doesn’t, I’ll be reminding him.” You answer.\n“Of that I have no doubt. Okay. Well it was nice meeting you Suzy, and may Tiamat’s blessed chaos always swing in your favor.” William says and then gets up. He makes a head gesture to Aaron who apparently has been watching the pair of you the entire time.\n\nThe pair of them leave the room and you get the impression they’re not going to bother telling Bobby they’re leaving the compound either. Perhaps William figures you’ll mention to Bobby that he attempted to whisk you away, along with confronting him about the wedding stuff, which you will most certainly be doing.\n\nAs soon as you can at any rate since Bobby is still talking with Diana, or at least he was until you see her running out of the kitchen and trying to cover her face. It’s obvious she’s crying or at least about to.\n\nBobby soon comes out of the kitchen as well. He doesn’t look in the best of moods.\n\n“Food’s in the kitchen, serve yourselves.” He says. Nobody says anything, except Helen who asks what’s going on when she enters the room. Bobby just waves her away and tells her to see to the children as usual then he slumps down by the chair next to you. Bobby’s family at this point heads into the kitchen, not wishing to\n\n“It’s done.” He says.\n“Well don’t look so down about it. And what’s done exactly? Did she get the message? Am I still going to have to worry about her?”\n“No. For the last time no. It’s done. It’s over. I made it quite clear that it’s over between her and I. So clear in fact that she probably hates me more than you now.”\n“I seriously doubt that, but do you think it’s wise to let her run around this house if she hates you?”\n“(Sigh) Suzy, I’m not throwing her out and I’m not killing her okay?”\n“Okay fine. If you want to live dangerously…”\n“Suzy, how about this. If you REALLY hate her that much, then why don’t YOU kill her? Seriously, you have my permission if it will get you to stop bitching about it.”\n\nYou didn’t really expect Bobby to say that, but then…\n\n“Well I suppose that would make the wedding sacrifice a lot easier.” You say which causes an eyebrow raise by Bobby.\n\n“Great, so you know. Who told you? Wait, I know. William did right?” Bobby says.\n“Yeah, I think he hoped to scare me into leaving with him…speaking of which I think he and Aaron left.” You answer.\n“Figures. (Sigh) I don’t even know why I’m bothering trying to hold this family together. Most of them aren’t even here. One of them hates me, and the rest aren’t exactly sterling examples of Tiamat’s Chosen. In fact the ones that are here are probably here because it’s safe and filled with enough supplies to live comfortably.”\n“Well, what’s wrong with that?”\n“Nothing I suppose, but supporting about bunch of freeloaders wasn’t really part of my plan to honor Tiamat.”\n“Well maybe you need to change your damn plan. I mean its still early, but if you really feel like someone isn’t pulling their weight around here, then you need to just kick their asses out, family or not. I mean you’re the boss around here and your word is supposed to be law.”\n\nBobby sits up a bit as you continue to speak.\n\n“Look, you know you’re a leader and you know the head of this family. So you can’t give into all this self-doubt. You NEEDED to lay down the law to your sister Diana., but you know that’s just going to be a temporary fix. Now I think you KNOW what you’re going to have to do with her, but your past with her is preventing you from doing it, which is why you made your outburst about me doing it a few moments ago.”\n\nBobby continues to listen intently.\n\n“Now, I’m not going to do it for you unless she gives me cause to, but she’s going to have to be dealt with by our wedding day. Whether that means you exiling her ass or killing her, that’s up to you. Love isn’t one-sided Bobby, and if I’m going to have to ultimately submit to your beliefs and everything that goes with it including murdering innocent people, well you’re going to make a sacrifice to me as well. If not, well you can throw me on that slab and thrust that dagger in me and get it over with.”\n\nBobby looks a little overwhelmed by your ultimatum. He’s never heard you speak like this before and really; you’re a little surprised you’re saying what you’re saying yourself. You’re rolling the dice and betting everything here. You think you’ve got the inner strength to go through with all this, you just hope that Bobby proves to be just as strong.\n\n“Suzy, you are the love of my life and what you’ve just told me just confirms that Tiamat’s chaos did favor me when I met you. You’re right. I know I have to do something more permanent with my sister Diana. I’ll come to a decision tomorrow though. I think I need the rest of the day to recover from all the shit I’ve already had to go through. It’s not even night yet!”\n“Well, okay. I understand. Well, should we go eat with the rest of the family?”\n“Might as well.”\n\nYou and Bobby briefly kiss each other and go join the rest of the family who have congregated in the dining area. None of them say anything to you or rather none of them ask any questions if everything is okay or anything. Diana isn’t here and Bobby makes the announcement that Aaron and William have left and then tells Brandon when he’s done eating, he can go check the front gate to make sure they closed it properly.\n\nThe remainder of the day is a bit out of the norm for you since you spend it mainly with Bobby’s family. They’re surprisingly really into board games. Unsurprisingly most of the board games seem to involve conquest or killing everyone else.\n\nWhile you never really played many board games before, you catch on quick thanks to your years of playing strategy games on your computer and its fun enough that it keeps your mind off other things. You even manage to win a game of Scorched Earth.\n\nDiana never joins in, and at one point Helen (who was playing separate games with the kids) goes to check on her out of concern, but she remains in her room.\n\nEventually you start to get tired of socializing and you feel you’ve bonded enough with Bobby’s family for one day so you return to your own room. Bobby tells Ronald to take watch for the night and goes with you.\n\nBefore you settle down for bed, you check your phone out of curiosity to see if anyone has tried to call you.\n\n“Somebody call you?” Bobby asks.\n“Nah, though I didn’t really expect anyone to. Pretty much says it all about my ties to my own family.” You say.\n“Well I think we both know you’re already with your new family now.”\n“Yeah. Still, I can’t help but wonder how they’re all dealing with the situation in town. Though who knows, maybe its calmed down now. Anyway, doesn’t matter.” You say and get into bed.\n\nBobby follows and it doesn’t take long before he’s grabbing and grinding up against you. You return his affection and have pleasant round of passion before going to sleep.\n",
  "page 100": "Sheltered Princess\n\n\nThe Future…\n\nIt’s been about a month; Johnny should be home again soon. Just have to keep an ear open for that certain knock and his voice.\n\nYou wonder what things he will have brought home this time. You’re still pretty much good with the necessities. Maybe he will have found some new movies or books to bring you this time.\n\nAt first when he started going out, you worried about him even though he assured you he would be fine. Of course as time went on, you ceased worrying altogether.\n\nStill, after the first few years, Johnny was getting restless. Sure he was going out, but never for long periods of time.\n\nThen one day he went out and didn’t return for a full week. For the first time in a long while you worried so much when he did that. This caused an argument when he finally returned. You were so angry.\n\nYou even accused him of cheating on you, but deep down you knew that wasn’t and would never be the case.\n\nTo Johnny’s credit he was honest about what the problem was. He apologized realizing he should’ve at least told you before disappearing like that. He tried, he really tried and he thought that “you” would be enough, but he wasn’t like you. He couldn’t stay cooped up down in a shelter for long stretches of time. Even though he was in the presence of an “angel” he always felt like a trapped animal. Sometimes being around you made him feel and realize just how inferior he was to you.\n\nHe explained how the surface was better than he could’ve ever imagined. No law, no order, and freedom to do whatever he wanted to whomever he wanted. The pull was too great and was getting greater.\n\nYou were upset and rightfully so. After all he had professed that he would always be there for you, and now who would take care of you if he left?\n\nJohnny however insisted that he wasn’t going to break your heart. He assured you once again that he would still be there to take care of you; he just needed time to himself. He explained that he just needed to “wander” because deep down that’s who he’d always be. He also explained it would be safer for you if he did wander as he didn’t want to one day unleash his…urges out on you by accident.\n\nWhat could you do? How could you compete? He was a slave to his nature. It was like Bobby all over again.\n\nThat first time, you practically kicked him out and he left without struggle or even raising his voice, he just told you that he would keep his promise and that you would see that he would not fail you.\n\nNaturally you didn’t believe him at the time you were too upset. That entire month was a pretty bad one for you. You spent most of your time crying and wondering if you’d been a delusional fool for sticking your head in the sand and ignoring reality as usual. You even started reading those survival books that you hadn’t actually gotten to reading yet and rationing your food and water a little more since you were potentially facing an uncertain future.\n\nBut then when that month had passed and Johnny did indeed return like he always had in the past.\n\nAt first you were reluctant to even let him back in, but then you realized that he had kept his promise just like he always has to you. The reunion was a happy one and over the years you’ve gotten accustomed to this arrangement. In fact it’s nice to be by yourself too. You’d actually forgotten what that was like during the years Johnny was around all the time.\n\nYou hear a familiar pattern knock on the shelter door followed by Johnny’s faint voice coming from the other side. After taking the usual safety precautions, you excitedly rush to open it with your pistol drawn.\n\n“I’m home, my perfect angel.” Johnny says smiling and holding a couple of bags no doubt stuffed with goodies.\n“Well don’t just stand there, come in! I missed you.” You say and welcome Johnny back home like you always do.\n\nJohnny tells you a few things about the outside world like he always does, but in general you never care that much. As far as you’re concerned, what he does out there you don’t want to hear too much about and it doesn’t matter anyway. All that matters is his time with you.\n\nYou happily accept all the gifts and supplies he has brought for you and later on you and he embrace as lovers do.\n\nThe pair of you enjoy your time together, until its time for Johnny to wander again. But you never despair about it, because you know he’ll always come back.\n\nAnd one day, you know he’ll come back forever.\n\nIt’s not perfect, but then nothing in this new world is.\n",
  "page 221": "The more you think about it, the more you realize that William’s probably right. You’re just going from one fucked up family to another and you certainly aren’t cut out to kill someone in the name of a religion you don’t even believe in.\n\nThis is your one chance to back out of this mistake and you’re going to take it. You aren’t sure where you’re going to go after you leave, but at least you won’t be trapped like you are here.\n\n“How long do you think you’ll take?” you ask.\n“Shouldn’t take long actually. Just nonchalantly leave now and like I said make your way to the dark blue van. There are a lot of tarps and blankets you can hide under if you really want to play it safe, but as soon as me and Aaron are in that van, we’re leaving even if we have to drive through the gate, but again that shouldn’t be necessary.”\n\nNodding at William you get up and make your way out of the room, which from you can tell, nobody is even paying attention to you.\n\nYou spend half of your time constantly looking around, to make sure nobody is following you or anything like that, but again you’re in the clear. You manage to make it out the house and into the van in secret.\n\nThe van itself is pretty old, definitely a relic from several decades past. William has a variety of tools scattered all over the back of the van and you see the tarps and blankets in the back like William mentioned. They don’t look the cleanest, but you figure you might as well hide under them in the meantime. No point in risking someone wandering outside and catching a glimpse of you through the van window.\n\nSeconds, minutes and you think an hour passes before you start to hear voices outside. One of them sounds like William.\n\nThe driver’s door opens and you hear William more distinctly.\n\n“Okay Aaron, you go open it, I’ll pick you up as we’re going out.” He says and then shuts the door.\n\nThen you hear some squeaking around on the front seat.\n\n“Hey Suzy, you there under all that stuff? I sort of need my keys back to start the van up.” He says.\n\nYou peak your head out and out stretch your arm with the keys and William takes them.\n\n“Don’t worry, we’re almost the clear blondie.” He says starting up the van and begins driving.\n\nA few moment later and you hear another door opening and slamming shut.\n\n“Let’s get the hell out of this prison.” You hear Aaron say in a gruff tone.\n\nAnd with that, William hits the gas and begins driving at a faster pace and you slowly start getting out from under your “hiding spot.”\n\n“All clear blondie.” William says.\n“Yeah I thought we were well on our way now. So did you have any trouble?” you ask.\n“Trouble? Nah, by the time Bobby was done speaking with Diana he seemed so emotionally drained that he barely tried to convince me to stay. He basically just told me to leave and wished me and Aaron well. He didn’t see us out though, he sent Ronald to shut the gate when we left.”\n“So Bobby didn’t ask where I was?”\n“Actually he did, but I said I wasn’t sure where you went and that you wandered off a long time ago, probably back to your room. He didn’t seem to rush off to go looking for you though. I’m not exactly sure how that conversation went with Diana, but I know she went running out of the kitchen in tears and like I said he was pretty down.”\n\nYou aren’t exactly sure how to feel about that. You can’t imagine Bobby’s going to be in a better mood when he realizes you’re gone.\n\n“Shit, maybe I should’ve stayed.” You say.\n“Well it’s a little late for that now. Look, he’ll be fine…well okay maybe he won’t be fine when he realizes you’re gone, but he’ll get over it. He’ll most likely just get back with Diana out of duty and their history together and she’ll take him back, because he’s everything in the world to her. And in time they’ll live happily ever after, more or less. Nothing’s perfect, nor should it be.”\n“Chaos always finds a way.” Aaron adds in creepy tone. You realize he hasn’t taken his eyes off of you which is a little concerning.\n\n“Um…yeah…so what’s next?” you ask wearily.\n“What’s next? Well, that’s an interesting question. Before you were coming along, I’m pretty sure Aaron here wanted to go indulge in some of the looting going on in town. Can’t say I was opposed to that idea either. I guess we could still go do that since I imagine you probably want to go back home right?”\n“That’s NOT what you said William! You said we were using this blonde bitch and tossing her violated corpse out the fucking van!” Aaron suddenly blurts out.\n\nNow you back up and freeze. Terror fills every inch of your body.\n\n“(Sigh) By Tiamat’s Twenty Tits, do you have any fucking impulse control Aaron? Now this is going to be harder than it needs to be.” William says without even stopping his driving.\n\nYou start looking around the van and eyeing one of the many tools laying the floor, but before you can even reach any of them, Aaron pulls a pistol.\n\n“DO NOT even think about it bitch!” he exclaims and is about to get up out his seat and head toward you, but William grabs his shoulder.\n\n“Aaron will you calm the fuck down for just one fucking second. Now you’re going to get yer dick in that soon, we both are, but I’d like to at least drive far enough away from the damn compound and find a nice place to park where we can do this with minor possible distractions. I’d think you’d like to take your time with this one right?”\n\nAaron glares at William, but doesn’t argue any more. He still continues to hold the gun on you though. At this moment you feel like a fucking idiot. Not do you wish you never left the compound, but you also wish you never left home. You start to cry and sniffle.\n\n“(sob) Please you don’t have to do this…” you whimper.\n“Awwww…I thought you were stronger than that Suzy and weren’t gonna get too weepy about this. (Sigh) Besides that’s not gonna do ya any good anyway blondie. This is going to happen. However, Aaron here has been a little dramatic about the whole situation as usual. I never said we were going to throw your corpse out this van. I mean maybe we will if you put up a fight…but since I’ve grown to like you a little, I’m thinking if you just submit and let us do what we’re gonna do without any problems, well I’ll be happy to take you back home or drop you off anywhere else in town. Your choice of course.” William explains matter of factly.\n\nEither get raped and survive, or die. Those are your choices and those are no kind of choices at all, but it’s what’s been given to you.\n\nYou start to think about the pair of them violating you and it’s starts to make you sick. In fact you even start hyperventilating and coughing up, though you don’t actually vomit. Aaron makes some threat about how if you don’t stop it, he’s going to shove his dick in your mouth and give you something real to choke on.\n\nAre they going to do it one after another or are they going to “kebob” you like pig on a spit? Are they going to sodomize you or slap you around while fucking you? Are they going to just kill you anyway after they’ve had their jollies?\n\nAs the van keeps driving through the woods, your mind keeps racing about how maybe you might be able to survive this if you just give in…\n\nAnd you can’t do it. You can’t just let these fuckers shove their dicks in you like some meat with holes in it. You have to at least try to resist. You might die, but the alternative is even worse. You don’t think you’d be able to live with yourself.\n\nMustering up all your inner strength and recomposing yourself, you start taking off your clothing, which immediately gets Aaron’s attention.\n\n“What’re you doing?” he asks.\n“I’m taking my clothes, I mean that’s what you guys want right?” you say still sniffling a bit.\n\nAt this point William’s head turns sideways so he can see.\n\n“Well glad to see you’ve gotten with the program so fast. Shit, you got some nice tits on you. I mean I figured you did, but seeing them uncovered is even better. Can’t wait to see ‘em up close. I bet you made Bobby REALLY happy.” William remarks.\n“She better make ME really happy by letting me fuck her in the ass!” Aaron exclaims.\n“Pretty sure she’s gonna let us do whatever, right Suzy?”\n“Whatever you both want William.” You say in defeat.\n\nEventually you strip off the last bit of your clothing.\n\n“I’m ready.” you say meekly and spread your legs wide giving Aaron an eyeful of your lady bits.\n\nWilliam looks again and almost does a double take.\n\n“Shit, well hold on girl, we’ll get to…”\n“Fuck that, I’m not waiting any longer.” Aaron says and is already got his hard cock out in one hand and still holding his pistol in the other.\n\nAaron’s already on top of you before William can stop him this time and he gets the head of his dick partially in you before you grab a nearby awl on the floor of the van and stab him in the side of the neck with it repeatedly.\n\nAaron yells in pain, and tries to shoot you in the head, but he only succeeds in blowing off your ear and hitting you in the shoulder before he drops the pistol entirely and collapses completely on top of you.\n\n“Oh fuck it.” William remarks and the van comes to a screeching halt.\n\nScreaming in pain yourself, you try to grab for Aaron’s pistol, but William manages to get it from you first. Bleeding, scared, tears in your eyes and partially deaf, and trying to catch your breath from this whole ordeal. You stare at William who is looking down at you with gun in hand. You try your best to give him a look of defiance even though all you want to do is cry.\n\n“I probably would’ve done the same thing blondie. Protecting yer virtue to the end. While I’m disappointed I won’t be experiencing some of what Bobby got, I’m glad to see you were a fighter after all. Don’t worry, unlike some in my family, I’m not into necrophilia.” William remarks.\n\nAnd then he shoots you in the face.\n",
  "page 224": "THURSDAY\n\n\n\"And Suzy is the winner of the world twelve inch salami eating championship! Let\u0027s all hear it for our little blonde small town girl!\" The announcer shouts which is followed by a roaring crowd.\n\nNot even feeling full, you wipe the sour cream off your lips… and you stand up and yell:\n\n“Alright this is getting fucking insulting! For the past four nights now I’ve been winning contests involving eating phallic shaped food. What the fuck is the symbolism here? That I’m some whore that sucks cock all the time? For fuck’s sake, I’ve only had the one goddamn boyfriend and soon to be husband. If anything I’m the exact opposite of a whore! So whoever or WHATEVER is trying to send a message to me needs to just come out and fucking say it.”\n\nAnd with those words of indignation, your surroundings immediately change to that of a blasted wasteland. There is nothing around you save for burned out buildings in the distance and dead landscape. Reminds you a bit of a video game you once played.\n\n“You know, the entire world is soon going to look like this…how I wish I could be young and alive to experience the uncertainty and chaos that is going to shape the years to follow.” You hear a voice say.\n\nYou turn around and see Bobby’s grandmother again. She’s an old lady walking with a cane this time.\n\n“But enough about the future, let’s talk about the present. You survived a lot longer than I thought you would, maybe you are worthy of my grandson after all. You even are starting to manipulate him a bit, that’s good. The true leaders in Tiamat’s service have always been women anyway. I swear if it wasn’t for us prodding them in the right direction every now and then, most men would be content just jacking off to pass the time. Still, you aren’t quite there yet. I think today should prove to quite interesting. Survive today and you might just meet Misty yet.”\n\n“Okay, I want some answers, who the hell is Misty, and what’s going to happen today?” you demand.\n“You’ll find out soon enough what’s going to happen and as for Misty, well why don’t you put some thought into it. I mean it’s pretty simple even for you blondie.” Bobby’s grandmother replies with slight distain.\n“Well what’s deal with all these contests in my dreams?”\n“Sorry, I really don’t know anything about that. If you’re lucky and actually meet Misty, maybe you can ask her, but I just assumed you really liked dreaming about sucking dick...in a symbolic way I guess. Hmm, come to think of it this would explain why Bobby’s so enamored with you. Maybe you aren’t a whore blondie, but you sure got the mouth of one. It’s almost as if it was a highway for oral sex.”\n“Hey!”\n“Don’t take offense blondie. It’s a good thing. Suck a man’s dick right, and you can practically get him to do ANYTHING for you. I mean you got natural talent. Hell, maybe even Tiamat blessed you with it so you stood an equal chance against Diana. Now that girl, as much as she loves Bobby, she just can’t suck a dick properly. Bad gag reflex, slightly oversized teeth, I dunno. Tiamat works in whimsical ways I suppose.”\n“How do you even know all…nevermind I don’t want to hear anymore.” You say.\n\nBobby’s grandmother ignores you though and continues to speak.\n\n“Still, Bobby always did have a slight obsession for blowjobs. He likes them a lot more than he’s probably told you. He’s a bit too much of a gentleman that way.”\n“Gah! I’m done listening!” you shout feeling increasingly uncomfortable about hearing Bobby’s grandmother talk about his sexual interests.\n“Oh, alright Miss Prude. I’m rambling and it’s time for you to go anyway. See ya Deep Throat!” Bobby’s grandmother cackles again and then raises her cane and all your surroundings go black…\n\nAnd then you wake up.\n\n“Something bad is going to happen today.” You say to yourself.\n\n(Then again why should today be any different from the rest of this week?)\n\nYou look around and see nobody in the room (Save for Bobby’s grandmother’s portrait staring like a gargoyle). Looks like Bobby woke up before you as usual. You look at the time on your phone and see you’ve actually slept until the afternoon.\n\nWhile the normal thing for you to do would be to just stay in your room and avoid everyone, but given your recent dream, you think your best bet might be to be a little proactive today.\n\nAfter going through your usual routine of washing up and getting dressed you head down to the main living area where you know everyone usually gathers.\n\nBefore you get there you bump into Helen, who looks a bit harried and is carrying a pistol in one hand.\n\n“There you are, good. Saves me time. Bobby told me to go get you.” Helen says.\n“Wha…what’s going on?” you ask.\n“Aaron came back and he’s threatening to drive an army truck through the front gate if we all don’t leave the compound. He claims that we’re defying Tiamat by not embracing the chaos outside. Bobby’s been trying to negotiate with him through the intercom, but he thinks we’re going to have no option but to open fire on Aaron.”\n“Where the hell did he get an army truck? Is William with him?”\n“Apparently the town has been in a state of martial law since yesterday and the National Guard have taken over according to Aaron’s ranting. I guess he stole one. I don’t think William is with him. Anyway Bobby wants you to be safe so follow me to where all the children...”\n\nLoud shouting by Bobby in the distance suddenly interrupts Helen. You immediately rush towards where he might be located despite the protests by the Helen that you need to come with her though she just runs along with you.\n\nYou soon manage to catch up with the most of the family (Save for the younger children and Diana) who are standing in the foyer with their weapons ready and Bobby who has opened the front door.\n\n“Aaron, I tried being reasonable. YOU left here without permission, but that was fine because it’s obvious you didn’t feel happy here. There are several paths to Tiamat’s glory and you obviously had your own ideas about which one you should pick. Anyone here is free to leave, but NOBODY is going to be forced to leave due to your threats! Again, if you try coming in here, you’re going to be shot down like a fucking dog and I’ll personally perform Tiamat’s ritual of desecration over your stinking body so your soul NEVER enters Timat’s glory!” Bobby shouts and walks out with his rifle drawn. Bobby’s brother Jordan is the first one who cautiously follows afterwards and then everyone else slowly walks towards the door as well. You don’t think anyone has even paid any attention to you or Helen (who keeps pulling on you to leave).\n\n“My soul is already with Tiamat! You can’t do shit about it ritual boy! If you unworthy fucks won’t embrace chaos as Tiamat intended, then I’m gonna bring it to you!” Aaron shouts through a bullhorn, which is followed by a laugh.\n\nThe truck revs up and Bobby orders everyone to open fire. You and Helen are still inside at this point so you don’t actually do so and just hang back as you watch Aaron mow through the gate followed by a hail of bullets peppering the oncoming truck.\n\nThe truck swerves hard to the left smashes into Brandon’s parked vehicle. You can hear him swearing about it. Meanwhile you also see Jordan jumping up and down in victory and running over to the wrecked truck.\n\n“Yeah! We got that bastard! Whoo!” he shouts.\n“Hey Jordan, get the fuck back here, don’t go off ahead like that by yourself!” Bobby shouts.\n“Aw, it’s fine, he didn’t survive that!”\n\nAnd that’s when Aaron proves Jordan wrong, starting by recovering from his crash and shooting several holes into Jordan. Then he follows up by throwing several grenades out the truck window.\n\n“SHIT!” Bobby shouts and everyone runs back, but not before several explosions occur. Nobody is killed, but everyone scrambles and on the ground crawling for cover. Bobby himself crawls behind cover of another parked vehicle and continues to fire in the direction of the truck.\n\nHelen now really tugs at you saying you need to come with her where its safe, but you wonder if you should try to help Bobby considering he’s the only one currently trying to kill Aaron. Everyone else has completely retreated and is even running past you.\n",
  "page 102": "“Well, if you want to look for a job, just come in and see me and we can look together.” You say.\n“Okay, maybe. First, I’m going to take these sheets and blankets and throw ‘em in the wash though.” Julie replies.\n\nThe pair of you head downstairs and part company as you head into your room and she goes into the basement. (It still feels odd to NOT go into the basement when heading to your room)\n\nYou lay down on your bed/couch, open up your laptop and prepare for the unfun task of looking for a job.\n\nTen minutes in and you’ve already gotten off track. You’re playing some flash game, but your mind keeps occasionally thinking about Bobby. You start to get upset again and think about calling him.\n\nYou pick up the phone and think of how you really shouldn’t do this, especially since you fully believe that he was being the asshole in this situation, but you can’t just let it end the way it did. You don’t know why, maybe its because he’s the first guy you’ve ever seriously been with and you can’t quite let go yet.\n\n“Hey.” Bobby says on the other end of the phone. You’re sort of surprised that he picked up after only two rings.\n“Bobby… I just want to say a few more things…” you say.\n“Suzy I don’t want to fight with you. So…”\n“No, it’s not that. Look I just want to say, I’m sorry I insulted your religion. I know how important it is to you.”\n“Well I appreciate that. Thank you.”\n“I just don’t want things to end like that last conversation we had. Our time together was special to me and I don’t want those memories to be completely soiled because we had a bad break up.”\n“I agree as well…I know I probably shouldn’t say this, because it only makes this break up even harder, but I ALMOST came close to abandoning everything for you…it just…just…”\n“I know. It was just too much.”\n\nBobby on the other end of the phone is silent, but you think you hear sniffling. Of course this makes your eyes water too.\n\n“I think… (sniffle) I think I’m always going to love you Suzy.” Bobby says. “I have to go….bye.” Bobby says and abruptly hangs up.\n\nNow you’re really upset. You knew you shouldn’t have called. You almost think it was better when you parted thinking he was a complete asshole. He sounded so sad, you wonder if maybe, just MAYBE you could convince him if you went and saw him one more time.\n\nYou get the idea. You’re going to do it, because what you had with Bobby is worth fighting for!\n\nYou leave your room and start shouting to Julie as you go down the basement stairs\n\n“Hey Julie! I know you’ll probably think this is a bad idea, but I want to go talk things out with Bobby one last time. He and I have so much history, so do you know if Donna has an extra set of keys to her… Aaaaaaaahhh!” you scream when you see Johnny standing over Julie’s bloody body with a knife in hand.\n\nJohnny doesn’t even flinch, he just smiles at you like nothing is wrong.\n\n“Bobby? …you have a boyfriend? Your sister didn’t tell me that…oh well…” he says flatly.\n\nPanic and fear fill every inch of your body and you instantly turn and run back upstairs.\n\nYou get to the top step and open the door just before you feel a sharp pain strike hard into your back. You manage to keep from falling backwards and instead fall forward so that you’re half way on the basement steps and half on the ground floor.\n\nTrying to fight through the pain, you attempt to stand back up and stumble in the process. Attempting to grab the knife in your back doesn’t help either.\n\nYou manage to get partially down the hallway before Johnny catches up to you again. You are grabbed roughly and then thrown face first into the floor as he twists the knife in your back. You scream out for help, but there is none to be had.\n\n“Stop screaming you fucking bitch! Why do you always scream!? I’m doing this for your own good! I can be your boyfriend! I can be a better boyfriend!” Johnny shouts as he attempts to strip off your clothes. The only consolation to your final fate is that you struggle so much that Johnny cuts your throat before he can rape you.\n\nNot that it stops him from doing so after you’re already dead of course.\n",
  "page 105": "WEDNESDAY\n\n\n“Remember, if you act today…”\n“Ugh! Shut up! I don’t care about your stupid shelters!” you hear Julie remark.\n\nYou open your eyes and see Julie to the left of you messing around on your laptop. (And clicking off on one of those annoying pop up audio ads)\n\n“Hey…when did you get up?” you ask.\n“I dunno, about an hour ago I think. Didn’t really feel like leaving the bed though, so I just figured I’d stay here and entertain myself on your laptop. Hope you don’t mind.”\n“Eh, it’s fine. Don’t mess with my bookmarks and setting though.”\n“Don’t worry, I’m not going to accidentally delete anything. I must say though with the extensive number of porn links in your history, I think you might have a real problem.” Julie mocks.\n“Mm, bold words coming from a woman who has popped up in several amateur videos on those sites.” You answer.\n“Hah. I don’t doubt it, but that brings up the question of why would YOU be watching those?” Julie asks.\n“Who said I did? I can’t help it if I’m browsing through the videos and suddenly your ass pops up in a still.”\n“If it’s just my ass, how do you know it’s me? Either you don’t or you’ve watched them enough that you know what my ass looks like without even seeing my face!”\n“Argh! I don’t mean literally! I mean YOU pop up, and I’ve seen your face in the stills though once I almost couldn’t tell because it was covered in cum!” you exclaim starting to get agitated.\n“Hmm, nice save.” Julie says a little unconvinced.\n\nAlready having expended more energy than you wanted to, you start to sit up and realize you’ve been wearing the same clothes for the past couple days.\n\n“Christ, I really need to take a shower and change these clothes.” You say and get out of the bed.\n“Yeah, I think I need to go do that too.” Julie says.\n“Well you can go use your own shower. I know we’ve been sleeping in the same bed for the past two days, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to be re-enacting a women’s prison shower scene from a movie.” You say laying down boundaries again.\n“Hey I think you had that one bookmarked!” Julie says jokingly.\n\nYou shake your head and grab some clean clothes before heading into the bathroom to take a shower.\n\nAfter washing up and changing your clothes, you feel refreshed. When you exit the bathroom, you see that Julie has left, presumably to go wash up as well. You check your phone and once again see nobody has called. You dial up your sister’s number and still no answer. You certainly hope Julie is right about her just sleeping somewhere else. But surely she couldn’t be so pissed at you that she’s moved out could she? All her stuff is still here after all.\n\nYou then hear a loud noise or more like a voice, but you aren’t sure if its coming from inside the house or outside the house. Still paranoid from yesterday, you grab the pistol and cautiously exit your room.\n\nWhen you get to the living room, you deduce the noise is indeed coming from outside.\n\nA quick peek through the window and you see several military men and a couple of military trucks and even an A.P.C.\n\n“ATTENTION! THIS TOWN IS UNDER MARSHAL LAW AND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOW UNDER WATCH BY THE U.S. NATIONAL GUARD. A GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE WILL SOON VISIT ALL OF YOU AND ASSIST IN ANYTHING THAT YOU MAY NEED DURING THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY. STAY IN YOUR HOMES. DO NOT COME OUT FOR ANY REASON. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE.”\n\n“Hey Suzy?! You hear that noise!? You got the TV up loud?” Julie shouts from somewhere up on the second floor.\n“No! The fucking National Guard is out there in force and it looks like we’re under marshal law.”\n“National Guard? Hold on, I’m coming down…” Julie says.\n\nYou turn the TV on to see if there’s anything about this, but you’re not exactly having any luck. You’re getting a lot of Ground Zero infomercials or news about shit going on elsewhere in the world. Local stations seem to be off the air with an “emergency test” beep but nothing more substantial than that.\n\n“What the fuck is going on?” you say to yourself.\n“Yeah what the fuck IS going on?” Julie asks coming down from taking her shower.\n“I dunno, I might need to check the Internet, not having much luck with the TV. Do we have enough food and water?” you ask.\n“Well we certainly got some food. Dunno about water though. I mean you can get some from the taps I suppose, but as you might expect I got tons of alcohol. Why?” Julie says.\n“Why? Because the National Guard just said if we try to leave we’ll probably get shot on sight that’s why! (Sigh) We’re basically prisoners here.”\n“Suzy, you need to calm down. You’ve been on edge since yesterday. You just said there isn’t a whole lot we can do, so we might as well just relax in the house. I mean really how much different is the day going to be for either of us?” Julie remarks.\n“I’m just…its Donna. I mean she’s still out there. I mean I HOPE she’s still out there. I mean the last thing I did was argue with her. Shit, I’m even a little worried about Peter and Kelly now and I never got along with them either. Still family though.” You say.\n“You tried calling either of them?” Julie asks.\n\nOddly you haven’t. You didn’t really have a reason before, but given what’s going on right now, maybe you should.\n\n“I think I’ll do that Julie. I can’t believe I didn’t think of it.” You say.\n“Sure, you go check on what family you can and maybe find out more about what’s going on. In the meantime, I’m going to go get a drink.”\n“Thought you were turning over a new leaf?”\n“You just said we were prisoners here. Not much else for me to do is there? Besides, I’m not going to get bombed out of my skull.”\n\nWhile Julie goes and deals with this situation in her own way, you head back to your room to get your cell phone to start calling up your other family members. You try Peter first since you figure he might at least answer.\n\nYou start to call Peter and then you hear a loud clatter from the kitchen. What’s odd to you is that you don’t hear a series of cursing following it; you do think you hear a stifled yelp though.\n\nPanic wells up inside you and you once again head towards where the disturbing sound came from with your pistol pointed in front of you.\n\n“Stop fighting me, bitch!” you hear a voice say.\n\nThis isn’t a video game this time.\n\nYou enter the kitchen and see Julie being held captive by someone you KNEW was no good right from the start. Johnny. He’s got one arm around her waist and another hand with a knife to Julie’s throat. He isn’t calm anymore. His face is displaying a rage and hatred you remember seeing a glimpse of in Uncle Ed when he looked at you during that horrible night with him. Julie’s face is one of absolute terror and tears run from her eyes.\n\n“Let her go you fucking psycho!” you exclaim pointing the gun in his direction.\n\n“Oh look, it’s your dyke lover come to rescue you! Fucking whores the pair of you! You think I’m scared just because you got a gun pointed at me? Pfft! Look at you, you’re so scared right now, you can barely aim that thing properly.”\n\nHe’s right. Despite having the gun in your hand, you’re incredibly scared.\n\n“Mmm, think I’ll have some fun with you two after I’m done cleansing you whores. Just like I did with your sister.” Johnny exclaims.\n\nYour worst fears are now a reality and it shows in your face. You feel ill and start to shake a bit.\n\n“Guess you two have been so busy rug munching that you haven’t been in the basement lately. Told you it was a mess down there.” Johnny laughs cruelly.\n\nBetween this revelation, Julie’s desperate expression of wanting you to do something, and your own fear, you’re having a very difficult time concentrating.\n\nYou feel like if you shoot, you’re either going to miss Johnny completely and then he’ll kill Julie, or worse you’ll kill Julie for him by accidentally shooting her instead of him. You can’t fuck this up.\n",
  "page 226": "Getting into a fistfight with Diana is one thing, but you’re definitely not up to dealing with this crazy asshole. You just hope Bobby is up for dealing with him though apparently Helen thinks so as you start to allow yourself to be pulled away by her.\n\n“Come on! Bobby can handle this, but we need to get to the children where its safe!” Helen exclaims and you start to follow her.\n\nThe pair of you run upstairs away from the sounds of shouting and gunfire. You soon reach the top and follow Helen through a corridor doorway.\n\nThen you promptly get smashed in the face hard by a blunt object. You fall backwards and through blurry eyes you see the image of Diana walking towards you holding a small bat. You attempt to get up, but the next blow is to your legs causing you to cry out.\n\n“Diana! Hurry up! Someone might hear that and see all this! Besides I want to go help Bobby!” Helen exclaims.\n“Will you shut the fuck up Helen? I want to enjoy this. Besides, sounds like Aaron is keeping everyone occupied, and ain’t nobody coming for this bitch.” Diana says.\n“Don’t be so sure, just hurry up and kill her. We should go help Bobby anyway.”\n“(Sigh) Fine. I swear Helen, you’re no fun whatsoever. Well blondie, I wish I could take more time with you, but time isn’t on my side any more than it’s on yours right now, so guess this is it. You never should’ve laid eyes on Bobby bitch.” Diana says.\n\nDiana ceases your screaming with another blow to the head and then another and another.\n\nWhile your face is mashed into mush, your vision becoming dark and your breathing becoming more erratic, your hearing isn’t completely gone and you hear several gunshots and Diana’s body falling partly on your own.\n\nYou then hear a very faint voice say, “I’m sorry” before everything goes black.\n",
  "page 104": "“Maybe we could look together.” You say.\n\nJulie looks a bit hesitant at your proposal.\n\n“I…I dunno…I’m just not in the mood right now...”\n“Come on Julie, I’ll help. The cleaning can wait.”\n“Well… I guess it would be good to know what to do and where to start at least. Why don’t you grab your laptop and come back up here and we can get to it.”\n\nYou head downstairs and back to your room where you pick up your laptop. Upon exiting the room, you scream out when you literally bump into Johnny.\n\n“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” you scream and nearly drop your laptop in the process. Johnny doesn’t do anything except stand there.\n\n“SUZY! What’s going on down there?!” you hear Julie shout.\n\n“Johnny what the fuck are you doing creeping around like that?! You scared the shit out of me!” you exclaim backing away into the living room still in a bit of a panic. Johnny doesn’t move he just continues to stand there in the hallway.\n\n“I’m not creeping. I just finished cleaning the basement, it was a real mess down there.” Johnny says.\n“I called your name earlier and you never answered!” you say.\n“I guess I didn’t hear you. What’re you getting so excited about?”\n“Because you’re fucking creeping around the house like a psycho! I think you need to leave!” you say with authority, but you’re really scared deep down inside.\n\nAt this point Julie has come down the stairs and arrived.\n\n“Johnny, I thought you left. What’re you still doing here?” Julie asks.\n“Nothing, I just finished cleaning your basement. You know I feel like my efforts aren’t being appreciated and you’re not being a good host.”\n“Good host? Alright fine, I thank you for your help, but you’re obviously scaring my friend and the party’s long been over anyway, so get the fuck out.” Julie orders.\n\nWhile you half expect Johnny to show some sort of anger or even get violent, fortunately it doesn’t come to that. He remains completely calm. Like dead featureless expression calm. Which is almost scarier.\n\n“Okay. Sorry I caused distress.” He says and walks past you and Julie (you both give him a wide berth) and goes out the front door. You immediately start locking it up.\n\n“Julie, go lock your back door.” You say busily putting the chains on the door.\n“Wow, that guy really got to you…”\n“Julie, please just go check your fucking back door!”\n“Okay, okay!”\n\nJulie leaves to go just that, but you only end up following her anyway. The backdoor is actually already locked though Julie rechecks it just to be sure.\n\n“See, we’re safe…shit, Suzy, you’re actually shaking.”\n“Of course I’m fucking shaking! I just had a goddamn flashback to when my Uncle Ed caught me finding the body parts of his victims! I’m telling you there was something wrong with that guy!” you say still looking around like Johnny is still lurking about.\n“Shhh…it’s okay now. He’s gone, and if it makes you feel any better he won’t be allowed in here anymore. Hell we probably won’t see him again anyway.” Julie says placing her hands on your arms in an effort to sooth and calm you down.\n“I think I need to lie down.” You say feeling wobbly and unable to catch your breath.\n\nJulie escorts you back to your room where you lay down on the bed.\n\n“I…don’t think I’m in the mood to look for jobs with you right now Julie.”\n“That’s okay Suzy, I wasn’t really in the mood to look for one anyway.” Julie says with a smile.\n“God, my heart is really racing…I feel like I’m going to pass out.”\n“You want me to get you some water or something?”\n“No, don’t go. Stay with me.” You say grabbing on to Julie’s hand.\n“Okay. I’ll stay here. Whatever you want. I’m here for you.” Julie says squeezing your hand while sitting on the edge of the bed.\n\nYou slowly begin to calm down and eventually you stop hyperventilating. Julie stays with you saying nothing, but just being supportive by sticking with you like a friend should.\n\nYou start to feel safer and close your eyes since the stress has still made you a bit weary. Before you know it you’ve fallen back to sleep.\n\nHours later…\n\nYou wake up and find yourself alone.\n\nYou grab your cell where you left it by the bed last time and see that it’s only a few hours to midnight. (Nobody has tried calling you either.) The odd thing is you don’t hear any music or the sounds of people. Normally Julie would have a gathering by now, and it’s odd that you’re not hearing it.\n\nYou then start to worry if something has happened. Still thinking about your incident with Johnny earlier today, you rush to the desk and grab the pistol you found before and load it up. Your older brother Ben showed you how to handle a gun once, you weren’t exactly very good with it, but you feel safer with it.\n\nCautiously, you open the door and slowly walk out into the hallway looking around you.\n\nYou then hear a male voice coming from the living room.\n\n“Shut the fuck up bitch and take it!”\n\n“JULIE!” you scream and run into the living room with your pistol draw and pointed in front of you.\n\n“HOLY FUCK SUZY!” Julie shouts and falls off the couch, dropping her console controller and ducking for cover.\n\nYou then see on her TV screen the origin of the male voice. It’s her character. She’s playing some sort of crime simulator.\n\nNow Julie’s the one with the heart palpitations!\n\n“Goddamn Suzy, you scared the shit out of me! What the fuck are you doing with a gun anyway?!”\n“It was in your dad’s desk. Sorry. I just woke up alone and…I guess I’m still a little scared.”\n“Well I was a lot scared when I saw that shit pointed at me! Especially with the game I’m playing, I thought I unlocked some sort of 3D mode for a second.” Julie says with a very small chuckle.\n\nYou apologize again and sit down next to Julie who has recovered and is busily trying to get her bearings again on her game.\n\n“Shit, some fucker robbed me while I was distracted. Gonna have to find and chase his ass down now. Wanna help? Got another controller.” Julie says.\n“No, I think I’ll just watch right now… so no party tonight?” you ask.\n“Nah, I mean there were some people that showed up earlier tonight, but I told them all to go back home since I cancelled it tonight. I figure after what happened earlier today with you, you could use the peace.”\n“Thank you Julie, that was really thoughtful.”\n“Don’t mention it. Besides, I figure this would be a good opportunity to start that life change like I mentioned before. Still didn’t look for a job though.”\n“Hah, well one day at a time…so is Donna here somewhere?”\n“Nope, still hasn’t come home yet. I actually tried calling her, but no answer. I guess she’s got it turned off or the battery’s dead. Probably at a club or something .”\n“I hope so…I’m starting to worry now.”\n“I told you she’s probably at a club or something. Like I said before, she doesn’t always sleep here.”\n“Maybe so, but given that that creepy fuck said he saw he last, well it makes me a bit suspicious.”\n“You still worried about him? Told ya, that guy was just an awkward aspie. Probably just didn’t know how to talk to girls. Here, why don’t you join my game? You’re obviously already in a shooting mood, it’ll take your mind off things.”\n\nTrusting that it couldn’t hurt, you grab a video game controller and start committing virtual homicide on a grand scale. Oddly, it does make you feel a little better and you both play a little past midnight.\n\n“Well, that was fun, I think I’m going to bed.” Julie says yawning.\n“Really? Seems early for you.”\n“Well unlike you I haven’t slept, plus I’m not hopped up on designer drugs like I sometimes am when I’m partying. Amazing what being clean for a whole day does to you.”\n\nAs Julie gets up to go to head off to bed, you aren’t exactly tired yet, but you’re still a little nervous about being by yourself.\n\nYou can’t believe you’re going to ask this…\n\n“Julie?”\n“Yes?”\n“Can you sleep with me tonight?”\n\nJulie’s expression to this request says it all.\n\n“Well okay, but stay on your side of the bed and if anything of yours touches anything of mine, you better respect me in the morning.” She says with a big grin on her face.\n\nYou head back to your room Julie taking the pistol with you, which Julie really disapproves of, but doesn’t protest too much since she’s just happy you’re spending yet ANOTHER night in the same bed with her.\n\nAfter locking the door and placing the pistol where you can easily reach it, you get into bed with Julie who to her credit does keep to one side of the bed and quickly fall asleep.\n\nYou’re up for a little while longer, but eventually you feel safe enough to let your guard down and fall asleep as well.\n",
  "page 225": "This is the man you’ve chosen to marry for better or worse. If you aren’t going to help him in a matter of life or death then that wouldn’t say much for your commitment.\n\nBesides, if he gets killed this whole compound is going to turn to shit and you’d no doubt be at the bottom of it, assuming Aaron doesn’t kill you all first.\n\nPulling away from Helen, you grab one of the dropped rifles by one of Bobby’s family and rush outside towards Bobby who is still taking cover behind a car and firing upon the Aaron. He sees you out the corner of his eye while still keeping an eye on the direction of the truck.\n\n“Keep your head down, I think Aaron escaped out the passenger door of the truck and is hiding behind Brandon’s car now. Where the hell did you come from anyway? I told Helen to go get you and the younger children to a safer location when Aaron showed up.” Bobby exclaims.\n“Yeah well I’m showing you that I’m not just going to let you do this shit alone. I’m with you all the way. No hiding with Helen and the kids, no matter what you say.”\n\nYou’re interrupted by gunfire on your position and Aaron ranting.\n\n“You think you can stop what’s coming by hiding? Hah! People are already fucking EATING each other out there! Shit, I’ll be doing you a favor by killing you now. Actually now that I think about… your blonde bitch looks like a fine piece of ass in more way than one!” Aaron shouts and starts laughing maniacally and then throws another grenade your way.\n\nYou and Bobby have no choice but to leave your position and make a dash back to the house entrance. It’s somewhat of a minor miracle that you and Bobby aren’t hit by any of the bullets he fires at you. You manage to get inside just as the grenade goes off and adds to the total of destroyed vehicles outside.\n\nYou and Bobby are on the floor though Bobby has partially managed to cover you with his own body.\n\n“What the hell did he do, rip off the entire National Guard armory?” you say as Bobby back kicks the front door shut from his prone position.\n“I don’t know but…”\n\nTwo more explosions are heard on the left side of compound. Aaron is apparently throwing explosives through the windows now.\n\n“Shit, I hope nobody ran and hid over there.” You remark as the pair of you start to get up off the floor.\n“Where the fuck IS everyone anyway? Nice to know I can REALLY count on these fuckers when the going gets tough. Why the fuck am I even bothering again? Fuck!” Bobby yells in frustration.\n\nYou understand his anger, but it’s probably not the best time for a rant.\n\n“Bobby, calm yourself. You can yell at those idiots later, but right now all that matters is that I’m here helping you okay?” you say.\n“Hey…I’ll help too…” a voice suddenly says. You both look and see that it’s Helen with a pistol in hand.\n“Helen, you’re supposed to be with the children!” Bobby exclaims.\n“Veronica and Brandon are with them. When they ran, the children’s room upstairs was the first place they went. Guess they were concerned about their daughters.”\n“…well I guess I can understand the pair of them running to their children. So they’re looking after all the kids then?” Bobby remarks.\n“Yeah, I figured since they were doing that, I’d come help you, though I hope I just don’t get in the way.”\n“No, it’s good. Glad you’re here Helen. What about Ronald and Denise?” Bobby says.\n“Haven’t seen them. Um, I haven’t seen Diana either…in case you were wondering.” Helen remarks briefly glancing at you after saying it.\n“Hopefully Aaron kills her.” You remark.\n“Yeah, well I actually was going to exile her today, but that might have to wait assuming Aaron doesn’t kill her.” Bobby says.\n“Okay, enough of all this. What’s the game plan?” you ask slightly disappointed that Bobby’s decision was to exile Diana rather than death, but you aren’t entirely surprised. Still, there’s always the hope that Aaron does kill her.\n\nBobby quickly snaps back to the situation at hand.\n\n“Well it sounds like he’s stopped with the explosives, or maybe he’s just fishing out more. I’d say the safest bet is to get to the second floor and shoot him through one of the windows. No point in going back out the front door when we can get the vantage point.”\n“How do we know he’s still outside, he might’ve already entered house through one of the holes he’s undoubtedly made with his grenades.” You say.\n“Yeah true. No telling where he might be heading first. The armory maybe?” Helen remarks.\n“He’s still gotta come through this way if he wants to go there. Given his state of mind though he might also try to do something like run upstairs and kill all the children for fun. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past him to try to access the prisoner’s dungeon and set them all free. It is on the left wing after all.”\nMaybe we should split up and take different floors?” Helen asks.\n“Maybe though I’m not keen on the idea of splitting up. (Sigh) Okay. Since you said Brandon and Veronica are with the children, I’m going to hope they’re up to dealing with Aaron if he shows up. I’m going to the left wing of the house and try to stop him there. I want you two to stay here and guard the foyer in case he somehow manages to sneak past me and is heading towards the armory. He’s going to have come through here.” Bobby says.\n\nHelen immediately complies with the plan, but you’re not so sure.\n\n“I really think I should come with you. Splitting up is always a bad idea in these situations.”\n“I don’t like it either, but it’s a big house and we need to cast a wide net to deal with this asshole.” Bobby says and then puts his arm over you and takes you aside.\n\n“Besides, as glad as I am that Helen stepped up, we both know she’s not exactly a fighter. I don’t want her coming with me and possibly getting in my way when I’m hunting Aaron, but by the same token I’d feel more comfortable if you were here with her since I know you can handle yourself and aren’t going to freeze up in a fight. I’ll be fine by myself. Don’t worry about me. I mean I did kill your uncle Ed by myself right?” Bobby whispers.\n\nYou glance over at Helen and as brave as she’s trying to appear, she still looks like a deer in the headlights. Bobby’s right in that her survival would probably increase if you were here and she had the misfortune of Aaron popping up.\n\nThen again by the same token, YOU’D actually feel safer being with Bobby. You’d also worry less about Bobby’s own safety if you were watching his back. After all, this situation is also little different than the one with your uncle. Aaron’s not just carrying a knife; he’s carrying around grenades and machine guns for one thing. Also, while Helen might be a nice girl, she’s ultimately not your responsibility.\n",
  "page 107": "“Johnny, look. We didn’t do anything to you, but if you felt that we offended you in anyway, then I apologize profusely. You can walk out that backdoor right now and nobody has to know about this.” You say trying to aim the gun so you know you’ll hit him with it, unfortunately he’s moving around with Julie even more now.\n\n“Yeah right. The National fucking Guard is patrolling out there right now, I’m not gonna get my ass shot off and stop trying to play psychologist, it won’t work. I’m not interested in anything you two dyke whores got to say, so let’s just skip to the good part!”\n\nSuddenly Johnny slashes Julie’s throat open. A gout of blood comes pouring out as Julie hisses and gurgles while clutching at her throat. The sight of this scares the shit out of you and it doesn’t help that Johnny also gave her a little shove directly at you after he did it, which causes a nervous reaction of firing your pistol.\n\nYou don’t hit Johnny though, you instead hit Julie and cut what little remained of her life even shorter. Her body falls on you and you scream when all the blood squirts all over you.\n\nYou attempt to push her off of you, but when you see Johnny looming over you, you try to bring your arm back up to shoot at him again, but this time he’s got the advantage and he grabs your wrist, breaks it and takes the gun out of your hand before pistol whipping you in the face with it twice. Your head hits the floor as you lie there now with a broken nose.\n\n“Stupid bitch. You all are stupid bitches. I don’t know why I ever think I’m going to run into anything different. (Sigh) Still, I thought after your sister told me about you…I thought you might be…bah better get this over with, the fucking Guard probably heard those shots.” Johnny says.\n\nYour last moments are seeing Johnny’s knife coming down several times on your face.\n",
  "page 228": "“Bobby, I’m coming with you and I’m not budging on this. We’re going to take out this crazy bastard together. I’ll worry less if I’m with you watching your back.” You say.\n\nYou half expect Bobby to argue, but that doesn’t happen. Instead he smiles and then kisses you on the lips quickly.\n\n“Okay then, you’re with me. Helen! You’re going to be guarding this area alone. Do you think you’re up to it?” Bobby asks.\n“I am.” Helen says with a nod still attempting to not look nervous.\n“Okay. Remember, if you see Aaron shoot him on sight and don’t even think about it. Oh and if Ronald and Denise ever come out of hiding and pass through here, tell them to fucking help you.”\n\nWith that last bit of advice, you and Bobby proceed to head towards the left wing of the house.\n\nYou and Bobby cautiously walk through the corridor keeping your eyes and ears open for any sign of Aaron, but so far you haven’t seen or heard him. The smell of gunpowder and smoke is in the air of part of the house and peering in one of the rooms you see the results of Aaron’s grenades.\n\nThe room is charred, blackened and wrecked. Whatever items were in this room have been completely destroyed and there is now a large hole allowing direct entry from the outside to the inside.\n\n“So much for the second den. Glad none of my personal stuff was in here. (Sigh) One more thing to fix.” Bobby remarks.\n“He either wounded himself during or you must’ve hit him from before, look.” You say and point at small splotches of blood in the room and creating a trail going to one of the other doors. (Or rather the entryway since the door itself is in pieces and not even on the hinges anymore.)\n“Yep, he’s going towards the dungeon. Knew he’d be somewhat predictable.” Bobby says and the pair of you follows the blood trail.\n\nYou pass through a series of room to get to your destination. Some furnished, some empty. The left wing of this house seems to be designed a little oddly though, almost mazelike. Eventually you get to a small room that has a door leading to what you assume is the dungeon Bobby mentioned.\n\n“Well he’s probably down there. The blood trail is heading down and we would’ve seen him if he’d doubled back. You ready?” Bobby asks.\n“Yeah.” You remark.\n“No seriously. Are you ready? Because while I know you’ve got your mindset on killing Aaron, you MIGHT very well have to kill whatever prisoners he’s managed to convince to help him. You might be less inclined to kill them due to them…well having a legitimate reason for wanting to escape.”\n“Bobby, I already told you, I’m with you on this one hundred percent. If that means shooting a few prisoners well Tiamat’s going to be getting a few extra souls to eat early or something.” You say causing Bobby to chuckle a bit.\n“Well that’s not exactly how it works, but as always I’m touched by your enthusiasm.”\n“You’re going to be touched all over by my enthusiasm after this is over.” You say and then give him a deep tongue kiss along with a firm caress to his crotch.\n“Whoa, easy there girl. We’ll get to that. Let’s take care of this first.” Bobby says reluctantly pulling back from you.\n\nTo be honest, you’re not even sure what came over you. Maybe you’re starting to not only accept this type of life, but enjoying it as well which might concern you more if you weren’t in the middle of hunting someone down and shooting them.\n\nBobby descends first and then you. While descending you start to catch the sent of what a dungeon full of unwashed prisoners locked in it smells like. It isn’t the most pleasant, but actually better than you expected from a dungeon.\n\nWhen you get downstairs the dungeon is relatively well lit. You see rows of empty cages to the left and right side and on the very far end you see Aaron who has a group of what you presume to be the prisoners. He’s apparently bullied them into acting as a human barrier.\n\nThey’re a mixture of old, young, male and female and they’re a dirty, miserable and practically naked lot. Most of them are barely standing up. Looks like taking care of them wasn’t high on Bobby’s list though then again why would it?\n\nAt this point if you have to shoot them (which seems likely) you think you’d be doing them a favor.\n\nAaron himself doesn’t look all that great from what you can see of him. He’s obviously been wounded and this is his last ditch effort to…well whatever his grand plan was. He’s holding something in his hand though above his head, probably another grenade.\n\n“You think you’ve won? Hah! I’ve already beaten you! You kill me and this grenade drops, then what will you do for sacrifices? You’ll have to go out and get more and I guarantee NONE of you are prepared for the beautiful chaos that lies outside. None of you are truly worthy of Tia…” Aaron rambles insanely.\n\nAaron is completely delusional at this point. Bobby doesn’t even argue with him, the whole time Aaron is talking, Bobby is taking careful aim at his head. A single shot drops Aaron and then Bobby tells you to run which you both do up the stairs.\n\nYou get to the top just in time for the grenade to explode. No harm done to you, but you can imagine the mess that’s down in the dungeon now.\n\n“You okay?” Bobby asks.\n“I’m fine. Guess you’ll have to repair your dungeon too.” You say.\n“Yeah…fuck!” Bobby yells and slams his fist into the floor.\n“What’s wrong? Didn’t we win?”\n“That sonofabitch killed all the prisoners! Now who the hell are we supposed to sacrifice for the wedding tomorrow?!”\n“Well…do I have to sacrifice someone? I mean I’m not asking because I don’t want to do it. I’m just asking is it absolutely necessary for the wedding? I mean couldn’t I make a sacrifice later when we get someone else? I mean I’ll even come with you to make the capture.”\n“(Sigh) No…I suppose in the scheme of things it isn’t necessary. I just wanted everything to be perfect. I dunno…Aaron might’ve been right about one thing. Maybe I am a little caught up in ritual…but still I THINK it’s important to revere Tiamat in a formal way! Just because I’m not completely running amok stealing army trucks and throwing explosives at shit doesn’t make me any less dedicated to glorious chaos! I mean…does it?”\n\nAnd that’s your cue to support the fragile male ego again.\n\n“Well of course it doesn’t my love. Your way is obviously a more intelligent approach to chaos. Just because something is chaotic, doesn’t mean it’s mindless. You’re playing the long game and attempting to build a dynasty. Instead of burning out quick, you’re plotting and planning labyrinthian schemes to eventually burn them all.” You say while looking into Bobby’s eyes and stroking the side of his face.\n“I’m so glad you understand me.” Bobby remarks and hugs you tightly.\n\nBobby really does always feel completely better with just a few supportive words from you. Its sort of amazing really since you didn’t realize you had this sort of power over him, then again you two were never really in a situation like this before except the first time you met and that was when you counted on him to “rescue you.” That dynamic has clearly changed. You guess this is what his grandmother meant when she spoke to you in the dream.\n\nIn any case Bobby tells you he’s going to check the dungeon to see if maybe there were any survivors just in case. You offer to help, but he says there’s no point in both of you trudging through blood and gore, which is probably covering the place. You tell him you’ll just wait for him and kiss him before he heads back downstairs.\n\nNo sooner has Bobby left, when you hear footsteps coming from the room nearby. Still paranoid, you hold up your pistol not knowing who is coming through\n\n“Who’s there?” you ask.\n“Hold on! It’s just me! Don’t shoot!” you hear a female voice say.\n“Helen?”\n“Yeah, it’s me! Is everything okay here? Heard another loud explosion in this direction.” Helen says and enters the room cautiously.\n“Yeah everything’s fine. Aaron’s dead. How come you’re not guarding the foyer?”\n“Well I was, but then Diana showed up and…”\n“Wait, you’ve seen Diana?” you interrupt and Helen’s head drops a little looking sad.\n“Yeah…she was um…I dunno. She showed up in the foyer and wasn’t acting…I mean she’d always had a mean streak in her, but I just couldn’t take it…”\n\nYou aren’t sure what happened, but obviously something occurred between Helen and her sister.\n\n“Helen, out with it. Where is she and what happened?”\n“She’s tied up in the large living room and unconscious. I had to knock her out.”\n“Wait you knocked out Diana?”\n“I had to. She was talking crazy like Aaron. She wanted to kill you.”\n“Well that’s hardly surprising.” You say.\n“Well she also wanted to kill Bobby and she wanted me to help in all this! I…I just couldn’t do that! I mean I don’t have any hatred for you (sniffle) and I love Bobby! You know? He’s the leader of this family and should be respected! I protested and tried to reason with her…but she just kept pushing and pushing like when we were kids and all my life! I couldn’t let her go through with it. (sniffle) Then she started threatening that she’d do something to the children…and I just lost it.”\n“It’s okay, Helen. You did what you had to.” You say trying to keep Helen from getting too weepy.\n\nIt’s still hard to believe that Helen stood up to… well anyone, let alone her sister. Maybe your recent actions provided a bit of a model for her to follow of standing up for one’s self, maybe there was just only so much bullying she could take and that last threat was the final straw. Maybe it was a combination.\n\nEither way, this event has given you an idea.\n\n“So, she’s still alive?” you ask.\n“Yeah, I mean even after all the horrible things she was saying, I still couldn’t kill her…she’s still my sister.”\n“Understandable, but she still has to pay for this treachery as all who betray Tiamat do.”\n\nYou call downstairs for Bobby.\n\n“What?” Bobby answers.\n“Anyone alive down there?” you ask.\n“No, just charred bloody body parts everywhere. Looks like we’ll have to do the wedding without the sacrifice.”\n“No, I think we’ll be okay. Come on up.” You state with a big smile.\n\nWhen Bobby comes back up you explain what recently occurred with Helen and suggest that Diana be the person you sacrifice. Bobby is silent for half a second and then agrees.\n\n“I’m not going to say I’m ecstatic about this, but it is what it is. You are my soon to be wife and Diana has proven to be a traitor. Death by your hand is certainly a fitting punishment. Do you have an opinion on this Helen?”” Bobby remarks.\n“I…my opinion on the matter is unimportant…. It’s just…very sad that Diana couldn’t have been… nicer. I support you Bobby and you too Suzy.” Helen says obviously upset.\n\nWith that settled, Bobby, you and Helen all make your way back to where Helen said she tied up Diana. When you arrive, you see Diana unconscious on the floor with her arms and legs hogtied tightly with a bunch of duct tape and also her mouth covered with it.\n\nYou also see Denise and Ronald nearly setting her free! Bobby scolds them of course and brings them up to date on the situation. Helen excuses herself and says she wants to check on the children and tell them everything has calmed down now.\n\n“Yeah and tell Veronica and Brandon they can come down too. Them and YOU two, I need to have a long talk with. ” Bobby says pointing at Denise and Ronald who are somewhat a little worried about Bobby’s comment.\n“What about her? Where are you going to keep her?” you ask pointing to Diana.\n“Well there are still a couple of intact cages down in the dungeon. I’ll probably throw her unconscious ass in one of them and she won’t be coming up until the big day tomorrow. Shit, there’s so much to do, cleaning up, getting prepared, (Sigh) well we better get started.”\n\nBobby tells you not to worry about doing anything as you did enough today just standing by him and he wants you to just rest up for tomorrow. You offer to help, but he really won’t hear of it. You don’t press the issue since hey if he doesn’t want you doing any work, you’re not going to argue about that. Before you leave he tells you that he’s got a spare gun in his clothing drawer just in case of an emergency.\n\nYou grab a quick meal from the kitchen before heading back to the bedroom where you stay for the rest of the day and night. You hear noise occasionally from downstairs. At one point you hear the sound of vehicles outside and looking out the window you see someone driving the damaged army truck in front of where Aaron crashed through the gate as a temporary barrier you guess.\n\nYou stay up for Bobby as long as you can, but eventually you realize he’s really focused on trying to fix and clean up the house as much as he can and probably won’t be back anytime soon. Too bad, since you weren’t kidding about displaying your enthusiasm to him after the Wild West shootout was over.\n\nTaking matters into your own hands with your battery powered substitute, you satisfy yourself before going to sleep, hoping that tonight’s dream doesn’t have you deep throating the Washington Monument or something.\n",
  "page 106": "You remember something your brother Ben said once when he was trying to teach you how to use a gun, “If you’re going to shoot, don’t think about it. Just shoot.”\n\nProbably not exactly best thing to tell someone, but nevertheless you remember it and so you do it. You shoot.\n\nAnd it’s all over so quickly you didn’t even have time to blink.\n\nYou hit Johnny in the forehead killing him instantly. His grip on Julie is dropped as he collapses backwards to the floor.\n\nYou’re still standing there in disbelief with the pistol still in hand, but now dropped to your side. Julie stands sobbing looking at Johnny and then begins to curse at him.\n\n“You motherfucker! (Sob) You sick fuck! (Sob) Goddamn you!” she exclaims.\n\nYou go up to her in an attempt to calm her down.\n\n“It’s over. It’s over. He’s dead.” You say and she stops to hug you tightly. Really you’re having a hard time keeping it together yourself, this psycho just admitted to killing Donna and stuffing her body in the basement. You still need to deal with that.\n\n“Oh my god Suzy, (Sob) you saved my fucking life! I’ll never forget this! (Sob)”\n“Okay, okay, just take it easy. (Exhale) Okay normally we’d just call the cops about this, but considering we’re under fucking marshal law right now I don’t think that’s an option. So we need to get rid of this body ourselves. Julie. Look at me.” You say staring into her eyes.\n\n“I’ll take care of most of this, but I need your help. Besides trash bags do you have any tarps or large sheets of plastic? What about a shovel?”\n“…(sniffle) I don’t know. If there is, they might be in the basement. I know there’s a shovel down there.”\n“Well, I guess that’s where I’m heading since I’m going to have to go down there anyway. Julie, why don’t you go lay down in your room? We’re going to get through this okay?”\n\nJulie seems still very shaken by this experience, but nods and believes you. She gives you another hug and then walks off to go lay down. As for you, you’ve got an unpleasant trip to the basement.\n\nYou try to prepare yourself for what you know to be down there, and fortunately the adrenaline of the situation has given you the fortitude and clarity to carry out what needs to be done, but as you’re walking down those stairs, it still doesn’t give you an enjoyable feeling.\n\nWhen you reach the last step, you fully expect to see a floor full of blood and gore, but you don’t see any of that. In fact you don’t even see a body. You can only guess he must’ve hid it down here somewhere.\n\nAs you proceed with the grim task of looking for your sister’s body, you notice that there is an open window down here, which explains how Johnny managed to sneak in here again.\n\nYou find the shovel and take it. You don’t find a tarp, but you figure you can always wrap the body using garbage bags.\n\nThen you notice the washer and dryer…\n\n“Oh god…no…Donna…” you say looking away with tears already forming.\n\nYou can’t tell without getting closer and opening them, but both of the door windows to both are covered in blood. You know he must’ve mutilated her body and shoved the pieces of her in both machines. A blood stained axe is also propped up next to them.\n\nYou can’t help but get sick and vomit nearby at the thought of this. You then break down and cry for a moment. You weren’t the closest with her, but you just wish the last moments were at least better. You can’t imagine what her real last moments were like. Or rather you have an idea, but you’d rather not dwell on it.\n\nYou don’t quite have the strength to proceed with the grisly task of cleaning up your sister’s remains right now. You stagger back upstairs with the shovel in hand trying focus on dealing with the body of the murdering fucker who killed her.\n\nYou get back to the kitchen and just stare at Johnny’s body, getting angrier and angrier about how light he got off. Who knows how many others he killed before your poor sister.\n\n“Someone should fucking chop you up.” You say.\n\nRemembering that you saw some duct tape in the desk in your room, you go back and grab it and then a trash bag from the kitchen.\n\nYou put the bag over Johnny’s head and then tape it around his neck, so more blood doesn’t smear all over the floor when you’re dragging him back to your room. From there, you take him into the bathroom and get his body into the bathtub.\n\nYou then head right back down into the basement and grab the axe.\n\nAs you’re heading back to your bathroom to repay mutilation with mutilation, Julie has come back downstairs to check on you.\n\n“Suzy, what are you doing with that axe?”\n“Julie just go back upstairs, I told you I got this.”\n“Are you going to chop up his body? Is…is he in your bathroom right now?”\n“Julie I said just go back upstairs, you don’t need to deal with this, I’ll do it.”\n“Suzy, I thought you were going to just dig a hole and throw him in it.”\n“Yeah well that was before I found my sister in fucking pieces in your goddamn washer and dryer!”\n\nJulie places her hand over her mouth and staggers back propping herself up against the wall.\n\n“Oh god…”\n“Yeah. This whole day sucks and maybe that dead motherfucker won’t be able to feel the pain of me chopping him up alive, but it’s the only satisfaction I’m going to get…besides with the National Guard out there right now, going outside to dig a hole probably isn’t the best idea now. Better I should wait to do that at night.”\n\nJulie has no words right now, but she’s starting to look at you a little differently. Maybe the combination of killing someone and the emotional trauma of finding your sister chopped up has caused a bit of a snap in your personality. In any case, you’re definitely taking a darker turn here.\n\nSuddenly there is a loud bang on the front door.\n\n“Oh shit! Who the hell is that?!” Julie says.\n\n“Fuck. That’s probably that government rep the loud speakers outside were saying was going to visit all the homes in the neighborhood. Someone probably heard the gunshot and sent someone here a lot sooner. Shit…shit…gotta think…” you say.\n“Suzy?! What’re we going to do? Maybe we should just tell them everything that happened! I mean it was self defense, surely they’ll understand that!”\n“Julie, we’re under marshal law. I got a man laying in my bathtub with a bag over his head and my sister is in pieces in the washer and dryer. At BEST we might be able to convince them of this entire outlandish series of events AFTER they arrest us, put us into whatever fucked up military cell they have, suffer hours of interrogation and god knows what else. At worst? They’ll just think we’re a pair of murderesses and execute us immediately without a trial.” You say and then exhale.\n\n“Or…we could try to cover this up and get them the hell out of here as quickly as possible.” You add.\n“Don’t you think they’re going to search the house?!”\n“Well that’s why we’re going to try to prevent that from happening. Distract them some how so they don’t bother. I mean I suppose we could try to run out the backdoor and over the fence, but I don’t know how are chances would be with that.” you say.\n\nJulie has no answer for you. At this point she’s so scared that whatever you decide, she’ll follow.\n",
  "page 55": "Nomad\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“Mom, why can’t we just head to Rebirth, it’s closer and we can get better deals there.” Lucy asks you.\n“Because last time we stopped through, they were beginning to go through a power struggle and while I know it’s over now, the new ruling head of that town is an asshole.” You reply.\n“And how exactly does that make him any different than the last guy?”\n“The last ruler of Rebirth at least tried to curb the amount of wanton violence and rape in the community. This guy encourages it. The place is little more than a glorified wasteland thug haven now. We walk in there and at best we’re going to come out of a firefight alive and poor. At worst, well I think you know what will happen.”\n\nLucy doesn’t say anything. She’s fully aware of the dangers of being female, let alone a teenage girl that looks like her in this new harsh world. Still, she can’t help arguing the point.\n\n“But don’t we risk death and worse just by roaming from place to place all the time anyway? Wouldn’t it be better if we found some place to settle down?”\n“Heh, I guess you don’t remember because you were so young, but your father and I tried that once. Didn’t work out very well when the little town that we THOUGHT was secure got overrun by raiders. That was probably one of the scariest days of my life. After years of previously being drifters, we let ourselves get unprepared. It was a mistake on my part since I thought a more stable environment would be better to raise you in, as it turned out, should’ve stayed a nomad and I’d say that’s worked out a lot better.”\n“How? We’re always living a hand to mouth existence. Our group still loses people to violence and other causes. I mean dad died because we don’t have proper medical treatment available.”\n“Lucy, your father might’ve died anyway even if we hadn’t been living a nomadic existence. I know they say civilization is rebuilding, but most of the places we’ve been to aren’t exactly stellar in their medical facilities themselves. The exceptions might be those fucked up Ground Zero communities and I doubt if you’d want to live some place like that.”\n“No, I guess not.” Lucy says.\n\nYou look at Lucy and understand she’s just being a little rebellious due to her being a teenager right now. She’s at the age where she doesn’t want you to be so close all the time. It’s funny because you went through no such rebellious period yourself and your lifestyle was the exact opposite right now. You never went anywhere; you never really did anything save for staying in your basement.\n\nNow? You’ve seen more and done more than you ever could’ve imagined. In fact you’ve lived a nomadic existence long enough that you think you prefer it, even when you temporarily settled down years ago. You (and her father) have taught Lucy how to take care of herself in this harsh world. Still, you do wonder if you’re probably a little overprotective of your daughter, you won’t be around forever and she should have the opportunity to live her own life and if that means she wants to live in a permanent residence then perhaps she should be given that chance.\n\n“Lucy, the world is still pretty fucked up now, but despite my previous cynicism, I suppose parts of it are getting better. Maybe one day you can find a nice place to settle down that won’t be run by a bloodthirsty warlord or in danger of being raided by mutant cannibals. And if that’s your choice, then you’re free to do it. I know you’ll have to live your own life eventually.” You say.\n\nLucy smiles at the permission, but reassures you that she had no intention of leaving you yet. It’s comforting, since it shows that she still wants you around. She’s still your child.\n\nYou, Lucy and the rest of your ragtag band of traders, tinkerers and scavengers make your way to the town of Blivop. Not exactly the best for trade, but at least the people there aren’t complete amoral rapists and murderers.\n\nLater that night when your caravan sets down for the night, you drift off to sleep with an old worn clown nose in your hand. You squeeze it a couple times, remembering happy times with your now departed husband.\n\n“Goddnight Lance.” You say and slowly drift off with the round red foam ball in your hand.\n",
  "page 109": "There’s no time to talk, you just have to get the hell out of here!\n\n“Julie come on, we’re going out the back and climbing over fence.” You say and the pair of you make your way towards the kitchen.\n\nThe banging on the front door gets louder, but you’ve already left and are in the backyard running for the fence.\n\nYou manage to get to lift yourself up, but not quite over the back fence before you hear several people shouting at you to halt. You also hear Julie screaming.\n\nYou turn your head quickly and see one soldier with his knee in Julie’s back, her face in the grass and a gun pointed at her head. Several other soldiers are pointing their rifles at you and walking towards you.\n\nYou panic and see no good way for this to end if you let them capture you, so you attempt to pull yourself over the fence to continue your escape.\n\nSeveral of them fire and you land on the other side of the fence with several fatal bullet holes in your body.\n",
  "page 54": "SATURDAY\n\n\nA loud noise in the distance wakes you up and you also notice you’re no longer moving.\n\n“HOLY SHIT SUZY WAKE UP! LOOK!” Lance yells and you feel a rough shake to your arm.\n\nYou instantly open your eyes and with a brief head swivel, you see something that is going to change your life more than anything else in the world.\n\nA mushroom cloud in the far distance.\n\nYou’re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn’t engulfed you, so you’re guessing that it wasn’t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one. Still, you can’t help but wonder if you’re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though. If so there isn’t much that can done about it.\n\n“That’s it then…the world finally went and did it…” you say to yourself.\n\nYou’re much calmer than Lance is, who is obviously distressed. In fact given that most of the vehicles haves stopped, you can only guess that he’s not the only one. Some are getting out to look and that’s soon followed by a few breaking down into tears or arguements.\n\n“Lance, we’re going to be okay. Just like you said, we’ll figure something out.” You say and start unlocking the door.\n“Where are you going? I think we should stay inside, I mean there might be radiation or something.”\n“Lance, if we are within the fallout blast, then we’ve probably already acquired enough rads to kill us anyway. I’m going to go try to calm everyone down because if this is it, then we’ll actually do a lot better in the survival aspect if we all work together.”\n\nIt takes a moment and you stand on top of your vehicle to do it, but you soon get everyone’s attention.\n\n“Hey! Listen up! This might be the end of civilization as we know it, but it isn’t the end of the world! Sure life is going to be harder now, but when hasn’t it been for us carnies? Why just this damn week we suffered through a military occupation, an internal civil war, an attack by freaks, and an attack by a bunch of rednecks. We’ve already splintered apart enough already. No way are we going to descend any further. We’ve come too far.”\n\nYou think you’re getting better at making speeches because this time you’re seeing less frowning faces and general attentiveness.\n\n“We used to drift from place to place providing entertainment as a source of our survival well what has really changed? We’ll still be drifters because that’s how we’ll survive. This world just got a whole lot shittier and we ARE nomads and vagabonds by nature. Surely we’ll be picking up, collecting, and scavenging useful material, items and the like to trade in our travels. I know we all have useful skills, surely with those, our ability to learn and adapt and a team effort we’ll be able to keep this FAMILY together a very long time.”\n\n“Yeah. Suzy’s right. We can survive this.” someone says and several others agree.\n\nWhile you don’t get a feeling of enthusiasm, at least this time you are not met with apathy.\n\nIn any case, you and some of the others get together to decide where to head next and what to do about food, and fuel. This isn’t going to be easy, but then this whole week has been a trial for you.\n\nNo longer are you the shy “good” girl who hid away in the basement, harassed by your family and living as one day blurred into the next. You are part of something bigger and not just that, but a leader.\n\nIt’s a brand new day and this is just the beginning of your brand new life.\n",
  "page 229": "Bobby is going to be able to take care of himself and if he feels more comfortable with you staying with Helen, well it’ll probably put one less distraction in his mind while he’s looking for Aaron.\n\nAlso now that the gunfire has died down a bit, you’ve gotten a breather to realize that maybe you rushed into things a little quickly due to wanting to help Bobby so bad. Aaron is really dangerous and you nearly got yourself killed. Maybe you’re becoming more assertive, but you probably should realize you’re not some amazon princess to go in guns blazing.\n\n“Okay Bobby, I’ll stay with Helen, but please be careful.” You remark.\n“I’ll be fine, you two just keep a look out and remember, if you see him, don’t talk, just shoot. Oh and if Ronald and Denise ever come out of hiding and pass through here, tell them to fucking help you.”” Bobby says and then kisses you before heading to the left wing of the house.\n\nSoon after Bobby leaves, you put your back against one of the walls and start keeping an eye on the doorways. Helen tries to do the same, but she paces a lot more. It’s obvious she’s nervous, but the fact that she’s nervous, starts making you nervous.\n\n“Helen will you stop pacing like that? You’re putting me more on edge than necessary.” You say.\n“Sorry. This is just so nerve racking. I’m really worried about Bobby you know? I wonder if we should’ve gone with him.”\n“You heard what he said, he wants us to stay here to make sure Aaron doesn’t manage to run around him to other parts of the house. Besides he said he can handle Aaron and I trust him.” You say.\n“Yeah I guess you’re ri…AH! WHAT WAS THAT?!” Helen suddenly exclaims causing you to jump.\n“Don’t fucking do that!” you say.\n“But didn’t you hear that noise? It sounds like its coming from the left wing where Bobby went.”\n“I didn’t hear anything, you’re paranoid.”\n“I swear! I heard something! Ohhh, I think we should go help Bobby, but I dunno…oh I wish none of this was going on!” Helen says and begins pacing in the middle of the room even more to the point of starting to shake a bit.\n\nAt this moment you starting to get concerned she’s going to accidently fire off her gun at you, not to mention she’s starting to get on your nerves. You walk over to not so gently calm her down.\n\n“HELEN! Stop it and clam the fuck down!” you say and grab Helen’s arm tightly.\n\nThen you briefly hear the sounds of rushing footsteps behind you and you don’t even get to completely turn around before you feel a crushing blow to the side of your head.\n\nYou crumple to the floor on your knees and then another blow to your head causes you to collapse flat on the floor and lose grip of your rifle. A pair of blurry hands quickly grabs it from you.\n\n“What took you so long?” Helen asks.\n“Had to wait for a fucking opportunity. Took YOU long enough to distract her.”\n“Well hurry up, I’m worried about Bobby! I think we should help him.”\n“He’ll be fine, I’m going to enjoy this…turn your ass over bitch, I wanna look you in the eye when I kill you.” Diana says and kicks you over.\n\nYou vision is blurry due to the blows to the head you’ve taken, but you can make out the image of Diana pointing a rifle straight at you. You try to get up, but Diana kicks you in the face.\n\n“Diana, hurry up!”\n“Will you shut the fuck up Helen? I’m trying to savor the moment and you’re ruining it!”\n“I don’t want one of our cousins suddenly walking in on us!”\n“Oh like they’re going to do anything…(Sigh) fine. I swear Helen, you’re no fun whatsoever. Well blondie, I wish I could take more time with you, but time isn’t on my side any more than its on yours right now, so guess this is it. You never should’ve laid eyes on Bobby bitch.” Diana says.\n\nDespite Diana aiming for your head and being at this close range she manages to completely fuck up her shot and hit you in the throat instead which doesn’t kill you instantly. Of course maybe that was her intension to let you suffer a bit more.\n\nAs you gurgle, choke and start to die, you hear two more shots and through blurry (and now dimming) vision you see Diana’s image get hit and fall backwards.\n\nHelen kneels down next to you and starts stroking the top of your head and hair as you bleed out and die.\n\n“Shhhh, it’ll be over soon. I’m so sorry for this Suzy. I always liked you. You were just in the way…” are the last words you hear.\n",
  "page 57": "Maybe it’s because of everything you’ve been through within the past week, (not to mention the incident with your uncle) but the oddest thing about this situation is that you’re more revolted than scared.\n\nThat isn’t to say you’re not scared though, you don’t want to be raped and you certainly don’t want to die, especially given everything you’ve just survived. The thought sickens you, but you realize there might still be a way to avoid your current horrible situation without resisting.\n\n“You gonna treat me like a whore? Come on then do it!” you say.\n“What?” Ranko asks.\n“Come on, stick it in me daddy. I want to feel…” you start to say when Ranko pushes the razor against your throat that it feels like its going to break the skin.\n“You playin’ with me bitch?” Ranko says with his face so close to yours that you have to prevent yourself from pulling away due to his bad breath.\n“Not at all, you’re doin’ it the way I like it. Daddy used to come into my room late at night and get rough sometimes, but I knew he only did it because he loved me…”\n“You…are one twisted…”\n\nBefore Ranko can finish his sentence you muster up the courage and put aside the revulsion long enough to move your head forward to kiss Ranko’s lips and even shove your tongue in his mouth.\n\nIt’s the worst thing you’ve ever tasted, and it’s only due to your strong gag reflex (Yes, if most people knew that about you they’d have a field day with the jokes due to that knowledge) that you don’t puke.\n\nRanko’s blade has cut your neck superficially due to moving your head forward, but your action has had the desired effect of him relaxing a bit. Not enough that you’d trust being able to escape or successfully get the straight razor away, but it bought you some time.\n\n“Hah, I KNEW you were into me! No bitch can resist a man who takes charge! You want me to do you like daddy did huh? Well did he ever do this?” Ranko says and then flips you over.\n\n“I’m gonna ride your ASS so hard, you’re not gonna shit right for a long time!” he says and starts pulling your pants down.\n“Oh no! I’m a virgin back there!” you say in the most innocent way possible, which of course makes Ranko only laugh like the rapist creep he is and rips your panties off.\n\nMeanwhile the blood must’ve completely left his brain and gone all to his dick, because the idiot dropped his straight razor in his desire to fuck you in the ass. You grab the straight razor, which is now near your hand.\n\nBefore Ranko can get his dick into the “promised land” you turn your head and swipe backwards with the razor. He’s close enough that you catch him across the face.\n\n“AGH! GODDAMNIT! FUCKING BITCH!” he shouts and falls backwards holding the side of his face. You scramble forward and grab a couple of nearby items before turning around to throw them at him.\n\nHe blocks and screams a bunch of obscenities, but before he can advance towards you, someone has at last heard the commotion going on.\n\n“Motherfucker…” Shrimpy says opening up the door and rushes to punch Ranko in the small of the back. Ranko back kicks Shrimpy causing the little guy to fall. Sensing he’s no longer in control of the situation, Ranko tries to escape out the door, only to trip and fall awkwardly on his face due to his pants and underwear still being around his ankles.\n\nYou aren’t about to let Ranko get away with shit, so you plunge the razor into Ranko’s ass and twist. His screams are predictable.\n\n“Was it good for you?” you say and then slam his face into the door twice, breaking his nose and causing him to gurgle a bit on his own blood. And for the finisher, you pull the bloody, shitty razor out of his ass and slit his throat with it.\n\nYou then fall back and sit on a nearby chair breathing heavily after your ordeal. Shrimpy at this point recovers as well.\n\n“Shit, I know this is a silly question, but are you all right?” he asks.\n“ (Pant) Well, I’m alright in that at least this fucktard didn’t ass rape me, but this wasn’t a pleasant experience (pant). Fuck. “\n“Well at least its over now…” Shrimpy starts to say before he’s interrupted.\n\n(Knock knock) “Hey what’s going on in there, heard all this…holy fuck…” Dolores says as she opens up the door revealing Ranko’s bloody face as the first thing she sees.\n“Nothin’ Dolores, just an ex-disgruntled employee. It’s been taken care of.” You shout.\n“SUZY! What happened?! Are you all right?!” you hear Klepto remark from outside.\n“Uh, she’s fine Klepto, she just needs some time by herself. Why don’t you help pull this asshole out of the trailer?” Shrimpy says and gets Ranko’s body by the feet while presumably Dolores and Klepto pull the rest of him out of the trailer.\n\n“What the hell happened to his ass? It’s all bloody…ugh, this guy smells worse than when he was alive.” You hear Dolores say, as the door slams shut.\n\nYou grab something to cover your naked lower half with while Shrimpy continues to stand in the doorway, just in case Klepto wants to play “white knight” and come see you.\n\n“Thanks Shrimpy.” You say.\n“For what, I barely did anything.” He replies.\n“It was enough that you got here when you did.”\n“Well I was initially on my way to ask where are next destination was going to be, but I guess that can wait for now. And don’t worry I won’t be telling Klepto or anyone else about seeing you…well less than fully clothed.”\n“Well I appreciate that too. As for our next destination, I dunno, with as crazy as things seem to be getting maybe we should just stick to rural areas for awhile.”\n“Yeah, probably for the best. Well I’ll leave now, but remember we’re all here when you need to talk.”\n“Shrimpy?” you call out once more.\n“Yes, Suzy?”\n“What is your real name?”\n“Heh, oh that. Been awhile since anyone used it, but it’s Lance.”\n“Really?”\n“Really. I know I don’t look like a Lance. You tend to think of a big tall guy with a square jaw. A real hero type.”\n“Well like I said, you were a hero today.”\n\nLance smiles at this comment and nods before walking out the door.\n\nAnd you’re all by yourself again. You look around the trailer and the new blood stains you’re going to have to clean. You immediately lock the door, go wash up and allow yourself to break down a bit in the shower.\n\nStill through the tears, you realize that you’re a lot stronger than you could’ve ever believed. You’re also glad you’ve got a “family” of sorts now, there is some comfort in that.\n\nThe rest of your day is spent staying alone in your trailer though given that the whole carnival is soon on the move it isn’t like anyone is going to just walk up and knock on your door now.\n\nThe motion of the trailer combined with the stress of the day causes you to collapse on your bed and close your eyes as you eventually fall asleep…\n",
  "page 58": "He might very kill you, but you’re definitely not going to let him rape you. You continue to yell for help and with all your strength you begin to fight back, moving your legs and arms. You even get a couple good hits to his face, but it doesn’t deter him, all it does is anger him.\n\nAfter he recovers from your assault outburst he punches you in the face several times and swipes wildly with his razor muttering obscenities the entire time.\n\nYour throat is slashed open and your body isn’t even cold before he starts violating anyway.\n",
  "page 51": "“Dolores, you’re not going to intimidate me any more than those stupid rednecks, if you want to go get your head blown off in a futile task then be my guest, but the rest of us are leaving…”\n\nWithout another word, Dolores points her weapon at you. This action causes the few that are still in fighting condition to raise their own weapons as well. Some of them at Dolores and some at you.\n\n“Don’t think so blondie. I’m running this show now.”\n“Dolores have you lost your mind?!” Shrimpy exclaims.\n“Shrimpy, you better pick a fucking side, because your days of riding the fucking fence are soon coming to an end, now you either support the carnival or you can get the fuck out too!” Dolores says.\n\nWhile having a rifle pointed straight at you, would’ve been terrifying at one time for you, it’s not anymore.\n\n“Dolores, if you think this is going to make me back down, you’re sorely mistaken.”\n“And if you think that I won’t shoot you, you’re sorely stupid.”\n“Dolores look around you, I don’t see a united front against me. All you’re doing is going to cripple your own cause by opening fire and that’s assuming you even survive this. If you really want to get revenge on those rednecks then you’re going to need everyone you can get. And THIS is not the way to do it.”\n\nDolores might be angry, but she’s not stupid and knows you’ve got a point.\n\n“All right then, you got a suggestion blondie? And don’t say just to follow you, because that’s not happening.”\n“No, I can see that. (Sigh) I can see that this carnival is doomed to tear itself apart so the way I see it, anyone who wants to come with me, leaves right now. This means we’re going to leave with most of our personal possessions and some supplies, half of that stuff is still ours, but we’ll just take what we need. We’re also going to be travelling lighter, so we’re just going to take some of the smaller vehicles. You can have all the trailers and the bigger trucks. Since I imagine most of the wounded won’t be in any condition to travel so you’ll need those if only to give them comfortable transport when the time comes.”\n“What about weapons?” Dolores asks.\n“Well everyone keeps their personal ones along with some ammo and YOU make due with whatever is left. Hopefully for you, most people that are armed stay with you. As a gesture of good will though, you can keep the few grenades we have. While I get the impression they would come in useful, I also think if you have any chance of beating those rednecks, you’re going to need them more than we will.”\n\nAt this point you hold out your hand to solidify the deal, which Dolores gives you a sideways glance before returning the gesture.\n\n“Fine, but I better not catch any of you cowards taking more than you need!” Afterwards she starts calling everyone and anyone who’ll listen of why they should stay with her and take revenge on the trailer park.\n\nYou on the other hand aren’t going to try to convince any more people, you’re done with speeches for a while, as far as you’re concerned it’s been a bit of a waste of time. If they want to come, then good, if not, then oh well.\n\nOn your way back to your trailer to pick up your personal belonging, you notice that it must’ve caught a few stray bullets during the gunfire. When you open up the door, you’re met with an even bigger surprise.\n\nOn the floor you see Ranko with several bullet holes in him and bleeding out. Nearby is a straight razor close to his hand. He sees you and struggles to speak.\n\n“Suz…zy…you gotta (cough) help…me…” he says.\n“Oh this is rich, you want ME to help you? What the hell were you doing in my trailer in the first place? Going to attack me? Maybe rape me perhaps?” you say picking up the straight razor.\n“I…was…goi…pologize…(gasp) (gurgle)…”\n“Yeah, excuse me if I don’t believe you. You deserve to die and with the day I’ve had, I think I’ll take the opportunity to enjoy watching it.”\n“(gurgle) Fuck…you…(gasp)…” Ranko utters.\n\nThose words are his last as he slowly finishes bleeding to death. Well he certainly left a mess, but considering this isn’t going to be your trailer anymore at least you don’t need to worry about cleaning up.\n\nAs you’re packing up, someone enters the trailer, you’re a little paranoid, so you immediately draw your weapon only to see Shrimpy.\n\n“Whoa! It’s just me! I was just wondering which…holy shit, is that Ranko?”\n“Yeah, the asshole apparently was hiding in here waiting to ambush me. Caught some stray bullets as you can see. Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. So what did you want?” You say.\n“Oh well, I was just coming to ask which vehicle did you want? I mean considering Lifto and Klepto are both dead, I figure we got more right to those two before anyone else might at least.”\n“So you’re coming with me?”\n“Of course. I was against attacking the trailer park remember? In fact there are several people ready to leave. Dunno how Dolores’ raid on the trailer park is going to go, but that’s hardly our problem right?”\n\nYou pause a bit before addressing Shrimpy’s rhetorical question.\n\n“Do you think I’m doing the right thing, abandoning the carnival like this? I mean Dolores had a point when she said I just threw out Jack without supplies because he wanted to leave. I feel like sort of a hypocrite.” You say.\n“Well…I think you’re doing the best with the cards that were dealt and that’s all you can do sometimes. I mean there are people here that have been with the carnival longer and they’re ready to leave without hesitation, so you certainly shouldn’t feel bad about it. I mean with the way the world is going nowadays, does something like a carnival even have a future anymore?” Shrimpy says.\n“Maybe not, we probably should stick to rural areas for at least a few days until some of this shit dies down, but I’m just wondering what we’re going to do with ourselves for the future in general.”\n“Well I’m sure we’ll figure something out. But just know that I’ll stand by your decision whatever it is.”\n“Thanks Shrimpy…hey what is your real name anyway?”\n“Heh, oh that. Well haven’t been called it in year, but its Lance.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah, I know I look far from being a Lance though. You probably picture a big tall heroic guy with a square jaw or something.”\n“Eh, those guys don’t exist in real life anyway, well at least they’ve never existed in my life, but you’ve been all right.”\n\nLance smiles and waits for you to finish packing and the pair of you head to Lifto’s vehicle, which to your surprise has been fitted to accommodate a “shorter” driver.\n\nYou, Lance and several others leave the carnival which is now in the process of gearing up for the raid on the trailer park (or housing the very wounded) you can’t imagine how that’s going to go, but you hope Dolores is successful even if you didn’t see eye to eye with her.\n\nLance and you drive along with several other vehicles in an odd caravan like fashion. Really there is no reason why everyone needs to stay together, since everyone is free to go their own separate way, but perhaps leaving the carnival is too much of a change and at least there is a little bit of a familiarity by sticking with the same people.\n\nYou and Lance converse the entire time you drive, though eventually at one point you start to get sleepy and Lance takes over with the driving. Feeling the safest you’ve been in days, you drift off to sleep…\n",
  "page 50": "Being a “native” of the area, you do know something of the types that do live in the trailer park. Most of them probably do nothing else except practice-shooting beer cans all damn day. Mel, is most likely right in that his people are going to be better shots and a gun battle is going to result in a lot of dead on your side.\n\nHowever you can’t just let them take your stuff, especially since you’re using a lot of it and there isn’t much to begin with.\n\n“Well, if we had the extra supplies we might be inclined to share, the fact is we don’t have much and what little we have, well we need. You start a shooting match here and you’re likely to wind up with more dead and wounded than what was worth the effort.” You reply.\n“You’ll forgive me if I don’t believe you darlin’.” Mel replies.\n“It’s true, seriously come on in and take a look yourself. We got a shitload of wounded ourselves in that big tent back there. Just you though, the rest of your people can stand out here and look fearsome.”\n\nMel chuckles.\n\n“Oh just me huh? And as soon as I go in I’m at your fuckin’ mercy. Nah, I don’t think so.”\n“Fine so take me as hostage. Here…” you say and drop your rifle and walk over to Mel. A couple people shout at you, but you just wave a hand at them as if to tell them to calm down. Meanwhile Mel stands watching you approach. When you’re before him, he’s definitely staring you up and down.\n\n“You got a pistol I presume?” you ask Mel.\n“Yeah.”\n“Well pull it out and put it to my head.” You say turning around and putting your body against Mel’s and then putting one of his arms around your waist.\n\n“Well… shit girl, you’re just somethin’ else ain’t cha?” Mel says barely keeping his composure as he pulls out his pistol.\n“If you say so. In any case you now have a little insurance that should be good enough for you shouldn’t it? I mean…I’m putting my complete trust in you. You’re in complete control” you say and grind up against Mel’s body a little more while turning your head a bit to flutter your eyes at him.\n\nMel is at a loss for words, but his buddies aren’t.\n\n“Woo Hoo, looks like the li’l blonde number is sweet on ya Mel!”\n“I say we take her back, instead of medical supplies. I never liked Bobby Ray to begin with. Motherfucker can bleed out fer all I care!”\n“You plannin’ on tradin’ Tina up fer her?\n“Why’s Mel get all the pretty ones? He’s already got Tina, I say one of us should get the blonde!”\n\nAt this point some arguing breaks out, followed by Mel shouting at them to shut the fuck up. He then turns his attention back to you.\n\n“Heh… you …you are trouble girlie. If I took you back to the trailer park, you’d probably have every man ripping each other apart over you. I can barely keep these dumb fuckers from doing that now. In any case, let’s go look at the medical supply situation. Come on.” Mel says motioning you to move.\n“As you wish.” You say.\n\nMel and you head back towards the carnival where upon you give him the “grand tour” showing him that it is indeed true that you don’t really have much in the way of medical supplies. He also sees all the people that are wounded too.\n\n“Hmm, well I suppose y’all COULD still be hidin’ such things somewhere, but honestly I’m inclined to believe ya. This place has even less military vehicles than the ones that were at the trailer park and it sounds like from what you told me there weren’t even that many guardsmen here. From the amount of wounded I see, you probably did use up most of the pittance that the military brought with them…how did you get all these wounded though? Nobody looks like they’re suffering from gunshot wounds. The cannibal creeps?”\n“Nope. All these wounded are from each other. Long story, let’s just say carny politics is complicated and I came out on top.” You reply confidently.\n“I see…well you have certainly displayed a certain amount of balls putting yourself in the vulnerable position you did. (Sigh) All right, you dealt straight with me, so I’ll deal straight with you. Guess we’ll try the town again.”\n\nAt this point you and Mel head back to the “neutral zone” where upon Mel releases you (reluctantly) and waves at his people to get ready to go.\n\nAs they drive away, you breathe a heavy sigh of relief and rush back to the others. Dolores approaches you when you arrive.\n\n“Well that was an interesting way to handle things, but it worked. Those good ol’ boys woulda probably killed and wounded a lot more of us.”\n“Yeah, an’ now we need to get the hell out of here. I don’t trust them to not come back with a bigger group and attack us anyway.”\n“Well, we probably could’ve done with a bit more of a rest, but I can’t argue with that logic, they weren’t the most reputable lookin’ an’ you’re the boss. One good thing about having some recently departed, is that the trailers have a lot more room in them now. Speaking of which, your own trailer is already hooked up to a truck. We should be ready to roll in about an hour.”\n\nFeeling like you deserve a rest after recent events, you head back to your trailer to relax.\n\nAs soon as you enter though, you are suddenly grabbed and tackled to the floor and the stench of bad body odor fills your nostrils.\n\n“Don’t scream bitch.” A familiar voice whispers. You get a good look at your assailant and see a man with half worn clown make up on his face.\n\nIt’s Ranko and he smells even worse now that he’s laying right on top of you.\n\n“I see a lot of fuckin’ changes to this here carnival have happened since I’ve been gone. Saw some of it from afar while hiding and waiting for the best time to strike. Nearly got eaten by those geeks in the process, but heh heh heh, I got away…”\n\nRanko begins to press his weight on you so you can’t wiggle away while keeping one hand on your mouth and holding a straight razor in his other. His whole outfit is filthy presumably from lurking about in the wilderness for days, but you also notice that he’s sporting a couple wounds of his own in the form of bite marks.\n\n“Nothing smart to say now bitch? Thought you were the ringmaster now. Head cunt in charge and all that. Fuck you, I SHOULD be in fuckin’ charge!”\n\nAt this point you manage to bite Ranko’s hand, which tastes foul, but it’s enough to cause him to take it off your mouth, giving you a chance to scream for help, before he backhands you across the face.\n\n“Bitch! Maybe if I raped you, you’d KNOW who’s in fuckin’ charge!” he exclaims and fumbles with pulling down his pants, and keeps the straight razor to your throat with his other hand. (Carnies must love straight razors)\n\nAll Ranko has to do is make a quick swipe and your throat is going to be opened if you struggle. If you do nothing he may very well rape you assuming nobody heard you scream. Of course he’ll probably kill you anyway after he’s finished.\n",
  "page 52": "If you’re going to have any hope and future of keeping this carnival together with you as leader, you’re going to have to get revenge on those rednecks. Maybe Dolores is correct in that there won’t be too many of them in fighting condition.\n\n“Okay, okay, we’ll do something about those hicks. Just gotta get organized first…” you say before Shrimpy interrupts.\n“Suzy are you serious? Haven’t you noticed all of the wounded and dead we have?”\n“Yes, and that’s exactly why we’re going to hit those bastards back hard! Look Shrimpy, if this is the way the world is going to work now, we need to always stand up to bullies or else they’ll just walk all over you. Trust me, I know what the hell I’m talking about. Now you can either get with the program or hit the road.” You say.\n\nShrimpy is taken aback by your harsh tone. He doesn’t reply, he just nods and leaves. He doesn’t leave, so he’s willing to fall in line despite believing that this is a bad idea.\n\nDolores and yourself both gather those still in fighting condition and convince them that an attack is in order. You manage to convince most, but there are a few that leave. Dolores is nearly ready to blow their heads off for wanting to take some supplies with them, but not wishing to cause another potential internal firefight you allow them to leave with minimal of supplies.\n\nWithin an hour and a half everyone that is willing to come with you is loaded up and ready to go. Shrimpy, in perhaps an effort to show his dedication says he’ll come too, but you tell him to stay behind with the wounded just so there is someone that can help them in case they have to be moved immediately.\n\n“I’m not exactly how much I’m going to be able to help in that regard. My name isn’t Lifto.” Shrimpy says.\n“Well, not all of them are down for the count. I’m sure you’d be able to help a few at least.” You say.\n“Suzy, you don’t need to do this, we could just leave. This attack is a suicide mission. It’s obvious from the last firefight with those good ol’ boys we can’t hit for shit.”\n“Well, fortunately we’ve got some automatic weapons in that regard, more bullets, more likely to hit the targets. Hey it happens.” You say.\n\nSensing he isn’t going to talk you out of this, Shrimpy wishes you good luck and you’re on your way to a path of rip roarin’ revenge, though there is a part of you that would just like to run.\n\nYou lead the drive to the trailer park since you actually know where it is exactly. When you arrive, it’s hard to tell if the place is in shambles from when their leader said they were attacked or if it always looked this way.\n\nNo sooner have all your vehicles stopped, when Dolores has already gotten out of the military truck you took and started lobbing the remaining grenades at the trailer homes.\n\n“Come on out you inbred sister fuckers!” she shouts and begins firing randomly at the rest of the homes.\n\n“Dolores, get back in the…” you begin to say and then suddenly Dolores actions have attracted return fire.\n\n“Over there! Fire over there!” Dolores shouts and takes cover.\n\nAt this point Dolores is giving out orders and you’re not being listened to at all. Despite Dolores’ enthusiasm for revenge it doesn’t suddenly make her a better “commander.” You at least try to remember all those times you played video games on your computer and know that wading straight forward into battle is traditionally a shit strategy so you attempt to try the classic pincer maneuver.\n\nUnfortunately given that you’re the only one using any sort of critical thinking and nobody is actually listening to you, you’re mainly stuck by yourself, trying to pick off the hillbillies when you see them pop up. If you were actually a good shot, you might’ve actually turned this attack into a successful one.\n\nAs it stands, the trailer park crew even with the wounded they have and catching them off guard with the grenades, still outnumber you severely and STILL have better shots. They also have explosives of their own perhaps not military grade like you had, but when you’ve got a lot of half empty liquor bottles lying around and people with too much time on their hands well sometimes even the lower born get creative.\n\nYour vehicles and your people are suddenly bombarded by several Molotov cocktails and someone even has a homemade “launcher.” The explosions are big, loud and fatal to most of your people who were still taking cover behind them. The others who weren’t have already gotten cut down by the gunfire. Dolores herself is lying dead with a bullet hole in her head and you’re suddenly hearing hillbillies whoopin’ it up and seriously worried about your physical safety.\n\n“Whoo hoo! Somebody keep the pretty blonde one alive! We can have a good time wit her!” you hear one of them shout.\n“Goddamnit Ray, stop thinkin’ with yer dick for one minute, she’s still armed ya dumb shit!” you hear Mel shout back.\n\nSeeing as none of the vehicles you came in are usable anymore you attempt to run. You just hope you’ve got more endurance than a bunch of overweight beer swillin’ hicks. They aren’t going to be able to follow immediately by any working vehicles they might have due to the flaming scrap heap blocking the trailer park entrance created by their homemade bombs.\n\nYou MIGHT have made it, if they weren’t lead by a more pragmatic leader type. Just goes to show that you can’t judge people just by where they come from…\n\nAs soon as you make it to the road, a single shot rings out and you feel a burning sensation run through your upper back and up your spine. You then feel numb and collapse instantly. You’re paralyzed, not just from the waist down, but from the neck down. You panic and the tears start when you know this is it.\n\nMel arrives before the rest of his crew who are now complaining loudly about Mel shooting you.\n\n“(Sigh) Well darlin’ you asked fer this. I get why you attacked, but that doesn’t fuckin’ mean we’re gonna sit and take it in the ass any more than you did. Just be glad, I’m puttin’ you outa yer misery rather than lettin’ the rest have their way with you.” Mel says.\n\nYou don’t reply and just close your eyes waiting to hear the final shot.\n",
  "page 231": "FRIDAY\n\n\n\"And now Suzy, having beaten the chicken soup out of all her other opponents this week, will take this final challenge by herself! Will she be able to do it ladies and gentlemen? Will she be able to impress Misty at last? We’ll find out today! Let’s give our small town girl some encouragement for her task at hand!”\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at…\n\nA big bag of dicks.\n\nIt’s even labeled as such. BIG BAG OF DICKS in big black lettering so you can’t miss it.\n\nYou don’t even look inside the bag; you take their word for it and double face palm before exhaling and looking back up.\n\n“Really?” you ask in disbelief.\n“This is the last task Suzy…” the disembodied announcer’s voice whispers.\n“I don’t give a shit, I’m not eating a goddamn bag of dicks! That’s just fucking disgusting for one thing and for another…\n\nSuddenly Bobby’s grandmother appears as she has been doing in your dreams.\n\n“See? Told you she wasn’t going to do it. Still, it was funny to see the reaction.” Bobby’s grandmother cackles and with a wave of her cane, you’re back in that blasted wasteland you were in last time.\n\n“So what now? Am I going to meet this Misty, whoever the fuck that is?”\n“Not quite yet. You’re still not married to my grandson. Misty has decided that she’ll meet you after that event…and sheesh you still haven’t figured out who Misty is yet? You suffer a head injury when Aaron was tossing grenades around?” Bobby’s grandmother asks and then taps you in the forehead with her hand.\n“Ow! Stop!” you say and back away.\n“I hope you aren’t this slow on the uptake today. Oh well, guess you can’t help being blonde. Anyway, congrats on your wedding and you’ve got my blessing. Good luck!”\n\nGood luck? Somehow that doesn’t sound reassuring. You’re about to ask Bobby’s grandmother what she exactly means by that, but then she waves that damn cane again and you’re enveloped the blackness and then you wake up.\n\n“Gah, fucking bitch.” You say groggily.\n“Um, I’m sorry for waking you…but we really need to see if this fits.” a familiar female voice remarks.\n\nYou look around the room and see Helen coming in carrying some red clothing.\n\n“Huh? No, not you…wait what are you doing in here anyway? Did Bobby spend all night working on the house?” you ask\n“I’m bringing in your wedding dress and yes, Bobby has been working on the house for the most part. Trying to patch up the big hole in the house, cleaning up the dungeon, blocking the front gate. He had to bury our brother Jordan as well. I don’t believe he’s actually slept yet.”\n“Oh yeah, forgot that that asshole killed one of your siblings. I didn’t know him that well, but sorry for your loss.” You remark.\n“Thank you. Yes, it was very sad, but to be honest Jordan wasn’t the brightest. I remember numerous times when looking after him I had to stop him from eating something poisonous or doing something else life threatening so it’s actually amazing he lived as long as he did. Still, he had some very endearing qualities. He looked up to Bobby a lot, wanted to be just like him. He even had a small crush on me I think to partially emulate Bobby and Diana’s old relationship.” Helen says with a smile before her face goes back to normal.\n\n“But we are all just puppets in Tiamat’s glorious chaos, so we all need to just move on right? Could you see if this fits?” Helen cheerfully asks holding up the red clothing which now looks a lot like lingerie.\n“Wait, that’s the wedding dress? It looks like slutty underwear from Hot Secret.” You answer and get out of bed.\n\nHelen’s face looks a bit offended by that statement.\n\n“My grandmother wore this on her wedding day! She had this dress made of the finest silk, not whatever cheap material they use in North Tiwanaland or some place! THIS is a one of a kind article of clothing! It’s not something you’d find in some edgy teenager hang out!” Helen remarks.\n“Okay! Geez. I’m not trying to insult the dress or your grandmother. It’s just…well I thought I’d be wearing something a little more… substantial. But seeing as your family isn’t exactly conventional and when in Rome…I guess I better try it on. Um, you washed it right?”\n“Of course. Hand washed it myself. Can’t risk putting it in a machine.” Helen says and hands it to you.\n\nYou have to admit; it does feel rather nice in your hands.\n\n“Oh, here’s the stockings and the shoes too.” Helen says and hands you what is apparently the rest of the outfit.\n\n“Red fishnets…red high heels…” you say.\n“Yes. Those shoes were also special made with the finest…”\n“Leather. Yes, I can imagine. Let me guess the fishnets were made with the finest silk as well.”\n“Well of course, what else would it be?”\n“What else indeed. Okay, well I guess I’m going in the bathroom to change.”\n“You don’t need to you know. I mean I won’t be offended if you change in front of me. We’re practically family now.” Helen says.\n“Um…no that’s okay. Besides, I should wash up before changing anyway. I probably still smell of sweat from yesterday’s events.”\n“Okay, well I guess I’ll just wait out here then and remember you can call if you need something.\n\nYou enter the bathroom and go through your usual routine of showering and such. Afterwards you finally get around putting on the “wedding dress”\n\nThe first thing you do is look at the dress before putting it on and wondering if it’s going to be bigger in the chest area. While you’re not lacking in that region, you’ve met Bobby’s grandmother (in dream form anyway) and she’s got at least another couple cup sizes on you. In fact her body type back in her prime was more of an old school 1950s pinup girl hourglass figure than your own “petite” size.\n\nThe funny thing is, as soon as you put it on, it seems to fit perfectly to your own body. The material isn’t any sort of spandex or stretchy material, it’s silk like Helen said, but given Bobby’s family’s strangeness, you have to wonder if it’s…magical?\n\n“Magical underwear.” You scoff; shaking your head in half disbelief you’re even considering it. Not surprisingly the stockings AND the shoes fit you perfectly as well.\n\nYeah, Grandma Morningstar probably had all this stuff weaved by a giant magical spider voodoo priest or some shit because it doesn’t make sense that any of this stuff would fit you so well.\n\nRegardless of its origins, you do feel pretty comfortable despite looking like a Hollywood streetwalker. The heels don’t even hurt your feet, though you’re still a little unsteady on them due to not being used to wearing such things. Let alone these being stilettos.\n\nThe last time you wore heels was when Uncle Ed made you wear stripperiffic clothing with the intent to lure Bobby and his dad into the woods where he could kill them. While everything turned out for the best because you met Bobby that fateful night, the part with Uncle Ed still gives you the shivers just thinking about it.\n\nYou look at yourself in the mirror one more time, before leaving the bathroom.\n\n“Well Suzy, you might look like a whore in this thing, but at least you look like a high priced one.” You say to yourself.\n\nWhen you exit the bathroom Helen stands up and looks at you.\n\n“Oh my. You’re…you’re…so beautiful looking. I knew it would fit you perfectly.” Helen gushes.\n“Yeah I am pretty hot looking in this get up. Shit, still can’t balance on these heels though.” You say.\n“Oh we have to go show everyone now what you look like. Maybe take some pictures!” Helen says approaching you.\n“What? I thought I was just putting it on as a test drive as it were. While I won’t deny this stuff feels pretty comfortable on my skin that I don’t mind wearing it, I sort of don’t want to be walking around the house with it on until show time. Besides everyone can see how awesomely sexy I am then.”\n“I think they should see you now. It’ll raise the spirits around here seeing you dressed like this.” Helen remarks as she begins touching your arm.\n“Well it’ll raise something with the males around here when they see me of course. Not sure about the ladies of this house, though you’re getting a little too close there Helen.”\n“Oh please? At least go show Bobby. I know he’d like to see you.” Helen says ignoring your previous remark about invading your personal space.\n“I’m sure he’s really busy right now, besides isn’t it bad luck for me to see him right before the wedding?”\n“Oh you’re thinking of those silly traditions for other weddings. That’s not the case here. Come on I’ll take you to him.” Helen says and at this point is pulling on your hands almost causing you fall.\n“Hey! I nearly fell! I told you already that you’re too damn close!”\n\nHelen immediately backs away and looks down submissively.\n\n“I’m sorry Suzy. I didn’t mean to violate your personal space. It’s just I thought…well it’s Bobby.”\n“What about him?\n“Well, as I said he hasn’t slept and he’s been working everyone like a task master trying to get the house as much in order as he can. And that’s his right of course. He is the head of this family. Still, during all the hustle and bustle when I was going to see him when he was cleaning up the dungeon. I caught him weeping and praying to Tiamat. Normally I wouldn’t have intruded, but he looked so…vulnerable and sad. He kept going on about he wasn’t even sure if this wedding was the right thing because he wasn’t confident that he’d be a strong enough husband for you and be a good provider. He was having doubts about even leading this family after all the mess that’s happened this week.”\n“Oh geez. I’ve already told him several times that I loved him and that I was behind him no matter what.” You say.\n“Well maybe that’s all he needs again. Sometimes a little boost is all that someone needs to feel better. Like I remember yesterday when I was with the children during Aaron’s rampage, I told them that they would be safe because Tiamat’s chaos was in their favor that day. They were so brave after that, they were perfectly fine when I left them alone to help you and Bobby.” Helen says.\n",
  "page 210": "When in doubt, always keep the gun.\n\n“Helen, I’m not giving you the gun, just stay behind me.” You say.\n“You…you don’t trust me do you?” Helen remarks.\n“What? No, of course do.”\n“No you don’t, you think I’m going to shoot you!”\n“Look, I just feel safer with the gun in my hand, now let’s go!” you say and start heading out the door.\n\nHelen isn’t letting this go though; she continues to bitch about your decision as you make your way through the corridor and down the stairs.\n\n“You’re a poor liar Suzy and I’m not sure what hurts more, you not trusting me after all we’ve been through or you feeling like you need to lie to me about your true feelings.” Helen remarks.\n“Oh for fuck’s sake, we don’t have time for this!”\n“I saved your life yesterday you know!”\n“And I’m grateful for that, but your current bitching about this situation isn’t exactly putting my mind at ease. You seem a little too eager to want the damn gun.”\n\nWhen you finally finish going down the stairs, the gunfire, yelling and guttural noises are louder, but you and Helen are still arguing even as you make your way towards where the fighting is coming from.\n\n“I can’t believe you still don’t trust me...” Helen remarks causing you to stop and spin around to address her.\n“ENOUGH! Just fucking STOP! At this point no I DON’T trust you! I obviously broke your hopes of having some fucked up three way with Bobby and you’re harboring a grudge about it. Now we can settle our differences later, right now we have to…”\n“SUZY LOOK OUT!” Helen suddenly screams in your face.\n\nYou spin back around just in time to see two of the creatures burst through the door in front of you.\n\nYou get off one shot, which goes wild due to being taken by complete surprise and not being used to shooting under pressure. You are tackled to the ground by one of them dropping your gun in the process, while the other goes running for Helen, who you hear screaming and running away.\n\nAs you struggle with the creature on the floor, you briefly look desperately over the gun that you dropped and try to reach for it, but it’s just out your grasp. The thing nearly bites you again and tightens its grip on your arms in an attempt to immobilize you. Even your knees to its groin don’t help.\n\nYou don’t know if this thing is undead or just rabid, but it hardly matters when it soon overpowers you and rips open your throat with its teeth.\n",
  "page 213": "Calm in the Storm of Chaos\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“Look Nergal, I know Emberville is miles away, but ever since those dumb ass rednecks have been aggressively trying to move in on our territory, we can’t trade with them or even New Security anymore in the near future. So get these crates of berries and apples over there as quick as you can and get us some medical supplies.” You say to Nergal having to strain your neck just to look up at him a bit.\n\nNergal is an imposing figure to be sure. He’s the largest member of the family, but he’ll always be your “baby” as far as you’re concerned.\n\n“But why do I have to do this? I want to go help Anu and Dad fight those trailer trash fuckers.” Nergal replies.\n“Don’t argue son. Besides, Aiden and Nadia are going with you. I thought you liked hanging out with them.”\n“Well they’re good in a fire fight sure, but…I dunno I always feel like they’re telepathic talking about me inside each others’ heads. They’re always making odd laughter about some private joke that only they know.”\n“Well that’s probably because they are, but trust me, you know deep down they’ll come through for you. Right?” you say asking Aiden and Nadia.\n\nThe two twins look at each other.\n\n“Of…” Aiden says.\n“course…” Nadia says.\n“Aunt Suzy.” They both say in unison with a smile.\n\nYou’ve gotten used to a lot of odd things since marrying Bobby, but these two sibling never fail to creep you out to a minor degree. You go back to address Nergal.\n\n“Now get a move on, you know those mutants really like their fruit…oh and DON’T waste any of it on some three legged hooker like before. You remember what happened last time, you had to use up some of the medical supplies just curing yourself of whatever the hell that… thing was carrying…ugh. You’re lucky your cock didn’t turn green and fall off.”\n“Aw mom…” Nergal says looking a bit embarrassed.\n“Don’t aw mom me. You heard what I said. Now get going and be safe son.” You remark and hug him goodbye before the three of them get in the truck.\n\nYou watch the gate open, the truck leave and the gate close again before going to check on your other son who is inside the house.\n\nYou find Enki in his workshop with a stack of books and reading one he took from the library (Unsurprisingly the town library was mostly untouched in the chaos, nobody in town has ever appreciated reading very much even before the bombs). As usual he’s reading something science related, probably in the effort to figure out how to possibly improve something around here...or perhaps he’s just doing it for his own enjoyment.\n\n“Anything interesting son?” you ask.\n“Oh. Didn’t see you there mom. I fixed those guns Dad took from the last raid on those rednecks. I was just catching up on some reading. I was reading about solar power, but I dunno where we’d get the panels. I guess we’re sticking with biofuel in the foreseeable future. In any case I think I need to go search the library again, I’m almost done with the books I took last time.”\n\nYou smile at how he’s always trying to learn new things. He’s always been the smartest of your children. He’s also the quietest and most introspective. He probably takes after you the most, not surprising since he looks the most like you.\n\nYou pat him on the shoulder.\n\n“Sometimes I think it’s a shame you didn’t grow up before the bombs. You would’ve really liked the Internet. All that knowledge at the tip of your fingers and you never had to ever leave the house.” You say.\n“Yeah, you’ve told me before mom. Sounded really useful, wish it was still around.” Enki replies.\n“Certainly occupied a lot of my time, anyway I’ll let you get back to it. Remember to eat something son, I know how you get really involved with your reading and tinkering.”\n\nLeaving Enki to his own devices you decide to go back to your own as well by heading to your room, and that’s when the sounds of various laughter and similar noises coming up from the basement stairs. School must be out.\n\nSeveral little ones pass you by, a few wave or say “Hi Aunt Suzy” but most to run off to go play. You don’t even know which ones belong to who anymore, you just know they aren’t yours or Bobby’s and you are definitely glad that it isn’t your responsibility to look after them.\n\n“Children! Remember if you go outside, to stay within the fence! Don’t try to climb over it! I mean it!” you hear Helen shout.\n\nYou then see Helen slowly walking from the basement stairs. She looks pretty drained but then having to look after the Morningstar youth constantly for years tends to do that to a person.\n\n“You need some help there Helen? You look a little tired.” You ask.\n“Oh, hey there Suzy. I’m fine. They were just a little overly rambunctious today. All excited about tonight’s sacrifice to Tiamat I guess.” Helen replies.\n“Oh is it time for one of those again? Didn’t realize. Seems like you’ve been having a lot of them lately.” You say.\n“Well, we are at war with those trailer parkers. Tends to bring in some more captives than usual.”\n“Mmm, true.” You say with a nod.\n\nYou’re about to leave when Helen makes more conversation.\n\n“You shouldn’t worry about them you know. They’re fine.” She says.\n“Who shouldn’t I worry about?” you ask.\n“Bobby and Anu.”\n“I wasn’t worried. Why would I be Helen?”\n“Oh…um…well I thought maybe with them leading these raids against the trailer park, your concern would be increased.” Helen starting to stumble over her words.\n“Not particularly, I know they’re both far more skilled than some trailer trash.”\n“Yes…of course. I just know how much you love Bobby and wouldn’t want anything to happen to him, and Anu being your first born and all.”\n“Indeed, but I’m almost inclined to believe you’re more worried than I am especially given your own feelings towards him.” You say.\n“What? I don’t love Bobby! I mean I do, but not in that way! I mean it’s not like that anymore!” Helen exclaims.\n“I wasn’t talking about Bobby. I was talking about Anu.” You say.\n\nHelen begins to look panicked.\n\n“I…I um…” Helen begins to sputter.\n“Oh come on Helen, Anu, looks almost exactly like a younger version of Bobby. You probably saw it as a second chance even. I’m not blind Helen, I know you’ve been fucking my son.”\n\nHelen’s eyes begin to tear up and she begins to shake. You ALMOST have an urge to press this a little further, but you just can’t bring yourself to torment poor Helen even if it would be funny to do so.\n\n“Helen, Helen, relax okay? I’m not angry. Stop worrying and calm yourself.” You say and put a hand on her shoulder in an attempt to reassure her.\n“Y…you’re not?” Helen responds.\n“Well…that might be the wrong choice of words. I’m not THRILLED by the idea, but I already confronted Anu about this, months ago when I first started to notice it. Wasn’t really a conversation I wanted to have and Anu swore up and down that it was all his idea…though I suspect he wasn’t entirely truthfully about that…”\n\nHelen’s head looks down.\n\n“I’m sorry…I just…I was so lonely…you don’t know what it’s like…” Helen meekly says.\n“I know Helen. I know. (Sigh) Look, the only reason why I’m not excessively angry about this is because…well this family isn’t exactly conventional and you’re both consenting adults and Anu’s old enough to make his own decisions.”\n“So…you’re okay with it?”\n“Eh…let’s just say…that time you brought me back to life in the past? That debt’s finally repaid. Just…just continue to keep it low profile okay?”\n“Of course! We will Suzy…and thank you for understanding.” Helen says and hugs you tightly.\n“Mm, well I am the nice one in the family.” You say patting her on the back and slowly withdrawing yourself away.\n\nHelen bids you goodbye with a slightly more upbeat tone and leaves to go see to the children. You just shake your head at how simple it is to make Helen happy. You guess after all these years; you still can’t help but feel sorry for her.\n\nYou may not be a born killer like most in this family, but you’ve definitely proven that even living among incestuous cult killers, a little kindness still goes a long way.\n",
  "page 212": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\"Suzy! You’ve won! You’ve truly overcome all odds! You have not only survived the various uncertain events of this week, but you’ve also thrived! Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give our small town girl some applause and respect for she truly is worthy of it!”\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at…\n\nA broomstick.\n\nIt’s just a plain wooden broomstick, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n“Nice. I’m guessing you were listening to Diana’s rant earlier.” You say unemotionally.\n\nNo sooner have you said that, when everything disappears and you’re facing Grandma Morningstar in the blasted wasteland again.\n\n“Hey at least it wasn’t a plate of tacos this time. Guess you really are deeply repressed.” Grandma Morningstar says.\n“Whatever. Am I finally done with all this nonsense? Am I finally meeting this Misty?” you say.\n“You figure out who it is yet?”\n“Yeah and I can’t believe I didn’t catch it before. Misty…MISS T…Tiamat.” You answer.\n“Yay! Your pretty little blonde head finally got it! And no you don’t get to meet her.”\n“What? After all this build up? Seems pretty anti-climatic.”\n“Yeah, well besides her being busy, the jury’s still out on you.”\n“But…didn’t I win? I’m part of the family now.”\n“Yes, yes, technically you won, I suppose, but the lot you’re with are practically just sheep to be lead around by the nose by Bobby so they’ll accept anything he says and Bobby’s in love so of course he’s fine with whatever you do as long as you’re petting his ego and sucking his dick. However, it wasn’t like you killed Diana yourself.”\n“So? I let Helen do it. I think it was pretty therapeutic for her.”\n“Hmm, and do you think Helen is going to be on your side in the long run knowing how she feels about not just Bobby, but you as well? You’re too soft hearted, but marrying her and Bobby might’ve better solved the potential problems you may have with Helen in the future. However you didn’t do that and while you probably appeased her feelings in the short term, I still say problems are going to crop up in the future with her. You don’t think she won’t just snap one day or silently plot against you?”\n“Maybe, but I’d say that’s unlikely.”\n\nGrandma Morningstar snorts.\n\n“And how can you be so sure?”\n“I’m not, but isn’t that what chaos is all about? The risk on a possible outcome no matter how small? I mean I’m sure the pragmatic thing to do would be to kill Helen, but I don’t really see why I should or need to. In fact a little kindness is already going a long way with her and will most likely do so in the foreseeable future. Besides, this whole week has taught me a little something about myself.”\n“Oh? And what’s that?” Grandma Morningstar asks.\n\n“I’m fucked up.” You say.\n“Well I could’ve told you that.” Grandma Morningstar cackles.\n“No what I mean is, there is a dark place within me. I know that now. I even feel it sometimes. Why else would I willingly marry a man in a murderous cult? I mean obviously I’ve got some serious mental issues going on in my head that I’ve only managed to not act on and outright block out mainly because I’ve been doing next to nothing in life. Until recently that is. I’ve been realizing that the more fucked up things get around me, the easier it would be for me to just say fuck it too and go full retard on the dark side and the thing is, I’d probably be fairly decent at it. Probably even better than most of the current family here.”\n\nGrandma Morningstar listens intently wondering where you’re going with this.\n\n“But I’m not going to do that, because I also still have a sense of decency. I see no reason to just go engaging in murder, rape and all the rest of that shit just because I’m…evil? I mean am I evil? I don’t know. Probably to most I would be. Probably to you, I’m not evil enough, but to me I’m just me. And THAT’S all I have to worry about. My own fucking code. So, if I want to show kindness to Helen because a small part of me feels genuine pity for her, then so be it. And by the same token, if I suddenly feel the need to blow her brains out because I feel she’s a risk, well we’ll just have to see what happens in the future.”\n\nGrandma Morningstar leans on her cane and remains silent staring at you, then a creepy smiles spreads across her face.\n\n“Well, I guess we will blondie. I guess we will. I suppose Tiamat’s chaos can be as kind as it can be cruel. Who is to say what is right? Well anyway, see you around blondie, I think you’ll be alright.”\n\nGrandma Morningstar waves goodbye to you, disappears and everything around you gets dark.\n\nAnd you wake up.\n\nYou turn your head to the right and see Bobby still with you partially under the blankets. He puts down a book he was reading.\n\n“Hey, it’s about time you got up. You look a little frazzled. Bad dream?” Bobby asks.\n“Eh…better than others I’ve had this week. Probably should talk about at some point later, but I’m surprised to see you here. I figured you were going to going to get up early to work on the compound’s defenses.” You say.\n“I didn’t sleep for practically a day remember? Anyway, I did get up earlier and gave everyone their orders of what I want worked on then I told everyone not to disturb me unless cannibals or more asshole family members are trying to wreck the place. So far haven’t had any trouble. Glad to see I don’t have to hover around them constantly.” Bobby remarks.\n\nAs Bobby brings you closer to him by putting his arm around you, and he surprises you with his next words.\n\n“So…Helen was in love with me huh?” he says.\n“…yeah…she was. She probably still is.” You say.\n“(Sigh) Shit. You don’t think this will be a problem do you?” Bobby says.\n“Why would it be? You don’t have the same feelings for her do you?” you ask.\n“No, never thought about her in that way. Didn’t know she felt that way about me until Diana opened her mouth yesterday. Guess it’s sort of obvious in retrospect. I was just more concerned about you though. I don’t want you fearing for plots against your life. I mean I can go talk to her…”\n“Don’t worry about it. I’ve discussed all this with Helen on more than one occasion this week. We’ve worked it out.” You say.\n\nWhile this reassures Bobby you start to wonder about a few of the things you spoke to his grandmother about.\n\n“Bobby?” you ask.\n“Yes?”\n“Are you disappointed that I didn’t kill Diana?”\n“What? What’s brought this on? I told you that didn’t need to kill Diana.”\nYeah, but it seemed so important to you before and it doesn’t have to be just Diana, I mean are you disappointed that I haven’t killed…anyone? I mean before this week went all to hell, I was supposed to sacrifice one of your captives that Aaron blew up.”\n\nBobby’s arm squeezes around you a little tighter as if to reassure you.\n\n“Suzy, I’ve had a lot of things to think about this week. I had all these grand plans of how this week was going to go and due to unforeseen events some of those plans went to shit. Such is the way of chaos and such is the will of Tiamat. Maybe all of this was her way of showing me that. But getting back to you, I had time to think hard about our relationship and why I fell in love with you in the first place. Your innocence.” Bobby remarks.\n“My virginity?” you say.\n“Ha ha! Well that might’ve been part of it, but I was referring more about the fact that well you hadn’t grown up in the same sort of environment I did. That you hadn’t killed anyone.”\n“Are you saying the fact that I hadn’t murdered anyone made you more drawn to me?”\n“Yes initially. You have to remember Suzy, as fucked up as YOU think your family were, you were the closest link to normal for me and I guess that was sort of a turn on. Of course in time when our relationship grew into love, I wanted even more to…corrupt you? I guess that might be the right word. I wanted you to be more like me, more like my family.”\n“But…?”\n\n“But, like I said a lot of shit happened this week. I tried to make plans that didn’t work out the way I expected which made me realize that maybe I shouldn’t have been making so many plans, and then I came to the conclusion that maybe I shouldn’t be trying so hard to change you either. I should just go more with the flow and whatever happens, happens. If you never sacrifice someone in Tiamat’s honor, that’s fine. Hell, if you never even accept her glorious chaos, that’s fine too. I love you for who you are now, that’s good enough for me and always will be.”\n\nBobby’s words make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. You might not be that “good girl” that once hid from the world in basement anymore, but apparently in Bobby’s eyes, you’re still “his good girl.”\n\nYou begin to initiate closer intimacy and then that’s when a flash of bright light briefly covers the windows and a loud noise is heard in the distance.\n\n“Shit what the hell was that?” Bobby asks sitting up and rubbing his eyes.\n“I dunno, I’m glad we weren’t looking directly at that flash though.” You remark rubbing your eyes too.\n“Wait a minute…I think I know…” Bobby says and gets up.\n\nHe walks over to the window and you follow close behind.\n\nIn the distance to the west, you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn’t a big one, but you’re still a little concerned if you’re in some sort of fallout radius.\n\n“So…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“Looks like. (Sigh) Shit.” Bobby says.\n“What’s wrong? I thought we were prepared for this sort of thing.”\n“Oh we are. I’m not even worried about that, it’s just I wanted to spend the day relaxing with you. Now? Well I think you know I’m going to have to go and direct everyone. Oh to hell with it, the apocalypse isn’t going anywhere. Let’s go back to what we were doing.”\n“Works for me.” You agree.\n\nEventually you will have to deal with this new world and whatever its going to throw at you, but for now you and Bobby allow yourselves to enjoy yourselves after this chaotic week.\n",
  "page 215": "With as much strength as you can muster, you swing the lamp upside the head of the creature that is pinning Helen to the floor which is enough to cause it roll off of Helen, but not enough to kill it.\n\nYou soon have problems of your own when the second creature you hit before has completely recovered and tackles you to the floor.\n\nWith the map still in hand, you attempt to swing it from your prone position, but the creature has already dug its fingers deep into that arm and forcibly holds it to prevent you from doing so. You manage to keep it from biting your face off by at least pushing your forearms up across its neck. At this close range, it doesn’t look rotten, just very dirty looking and crazed. Still, undead or not, you don’t want to risk getting bit, let alone killed and eaten.\n\nAs you struggle with the creature on the floor, a shot is fired into the side of the thing’s head and blood splatters on you, the floor and partially on the nearby wall.\n\n“Shit!” you shout and then try to pull yourself out from under the corpse. While you’re doing that, another shot is fired killing the other creature that was previously on top of Helen and recovering from the blow it took to the head from you. She then places two more headshots to both bodies.\n\n“I think they’re dead, we can’t waste bullets, if there are more of them.” You say.\n“Are you okay?” Helen asks touching your bruised arm, which aches.\n“Yeah, I’m fine.”\n“These things aren’t really rotten looking or anything. Maybe they aren’t undead.” Helen says.\n“Well I still don’t want to get killed and eaten by some virus infected asshole. Come on, this isn’t over yet.” You say.\n\nBy the time you get to Bobby and the rest of the family’s location, they’ve managed to wipe out most of the things and you and Helen don’t have much to do. Still, you wonder about their origin. Some sort of sickness perhaps? Maybe the government was fucking around with a secret weapon like they tend to do and it got out of hand. It would explain why there was a drastic rise in violence even before you left town and why the National Guard showed up later.\n\nIt isn’t until after all the mad attackers are killed that Bobby manages to address you directly. He’s incredibly tired looking, the rest of his family looks pretty tired too, but he looks like he’s about to collapse.\n\n“Are you okay?! They didn’t bite you did they?” Bobby asks, stumbling a bit from exhaustion.\n“No, I’m fine. We both are.” You reply.\n“Suzy saved my life.” Helen remarks.\n“Well, I think we both saved each other more than enough times this week.” You say which causes a bit of a happiness of Helen’s face.\n“Could’ve used your help a lot sooner, if you hadn’t been busy cheating on Bobby.” Veronica snorts.\n\nThis remark causes every family member to stop what they are doing and take notice. Helen, looks more terrified than she did when facing the rabid people. Bobby looks more surprised than anyone. He looks at Veronica and then looks at you. You keep a straight face despite Veronica ratting you out.\n\n“What’s she talking about Suzy?”\n“Well it’s like this Bobby…” you say and then grab Helen close to you and give her a kiss on the cheek. Helen blushes a bit and tries to remain composed, but she’s a mixture of bashful and fearful.\n\n“Before all this shit went down, your sister and I were bonding in a way that I don’t think you’ll disapprove of. Helen loves you. I love you. Helen likes me and I’ve grown very fond of her and I want ALL of us to get married. Right now.”\n\nNow you’ve caught everyone off guard. One moment they’re fighting for their lives, the next they’re attending a wedding. Not mention this new bombshell you’ve dropped.\n\n“Now?” Bobby asks.\n“We just won a great victory! What, you don’t want to marry two beautiful women?” you say.\n“I didn’t say that, I just…this is a bit surprising. Helen, I never knew you felt this way…why didn’t you tell me? I guess it doesn’t matter, we can discuss this in more detail afterwards, but by Tiamat’s Chaotic Cunt and Twenty Tits YES! I’ll marry the pair of you!” Bobby shouts and then you turn to Helen.\n\n“Helen why don’t you go get your grandmother’s wedding dress and wear it?” You say causing her eyes to light up.\n“You…you really want me to wear it? Are you sure?!” she asks.\n“I’m sure. I think you deserve the honors and I think she’d want you to wear it.”\n“Oh thank you Suzy!” she says and kisses you on the lips and runs off.\n\nBobby at this point tells Brandon and Ronald to drag Diana out from her cell. Veronica looks slightly disappointed by the lack of drama and is even more disappointed when Bobby tells her to gather the children for the wedding. He then warns everyone to still keep an eye out for anymore of those rabid bastards just in case you didn’t get them all.\n\nEveryone complies and soon you and Bobby are left by yourselves. Bobby takes a seat to briefly rest. He yawns several times in a row and is struggling to stay awake, but you can tell your enthusiasm for the wedding has energized him a bit. You decide to keep the energy going by sitting on his lap and making a fuss.\n\n“Hey, it’s not time for the honeymoon yet.” Bobby remarks with a brief chuckle.\n“Oh it’s always times for the honeymoon with you.” You say.\n“Damn, I wish I wasn’t so tired…hope I don’t stumble over the joining passage when I’m marrying us.” Bobby remarks as he rubs your legs.\n“Wait, isn’t someone else doing that?”\n“Huh? No, I’m doing it. I mean I’m the high priest here. Technically it could just be me and you here.”\n“What? That’s it? We could’ve done that a long time ago!”\n“I’m glad I didn’t because obviously Helen would’ve missed out…wow still can’t believe she was in love with me all this time…”\n“Is it so hard to believe?”\n“I guess I just wasn’t paying attention to her. I mean it makes sense in retrospect given how attentive she’s always been…just don’t know why she never said anything before.”\n“Scared of Diana.”\n“That makes sense…speaking of not saying anything. Why didn’t YOU tell me you were also into girls, let alone my sister?” Bobby asks.\n\nYou wrap your arms around Bobby and lean your body against him.\n\n“Eh…well I sort of went through some odd self discovery lately…I’m not into girls so much as I just like your sister. I can’t quite explain it all properly right now, maybe later. Let’s just say it’s been a weird week. Besides isn’t all this spontaneity along with the carnage causing Tiamat’s chaotic glory smile upon us or something?” You say.\n\nBobby looks around at the nearby mess of broken furniture and the couple bodies laying on the floor and smiles.\n\n“I suppose you’re right.”\n\nA few more moments pass as you wait for everyone to return. In the meantime you let Bobby rest a bit by closing his eyes. Veronica and Denise return first with all the children. Brandon and Ronald arrive gripping Diana by each arm. Predictably she’s swearing up a storm and accusing everyone of being against her.\n\nIt wakes Bobby up from his brief nap.\n\n“Oh? Everyone here? Good. Let’s get this started. (Yawn) Sorry, I’m so damn tired…”\n“Helen’s not here yet. You don’t need to stand up for this, just keep resting in your chair and I’ll just be right here on your lap. I’m sure that’s acceptable to everyone right?” you ask.\n\nBefore anyone can answer you, Helen returns in her grandmother’s wedding dress. Everyone is in awe of how sexy she looks in it. If Bobby needed anymore rousing from his tired state, this has certainly done it. She’s not having any problems walking on the heels either. In fact the only two who aren’t in awe, are you mainly because you were just having sex with her not too long ago and this a pale substitute and Diana who just swears and looks disgusted.\n\n“How do I look?” she asks a bit nervously.\n“Well I’d do you right now, if it was just Bobby here.” You say.\n“By Tiamat’s Angry Asshole I’m not fucking believing this! You’re seriously going to marry them both? The traitor and the whore? I guess it would take two to replace me! Your TRUE soul mate!” Diana yells.\n\nIgnoring Diana, Helen sits next to you and Bobby and the three of you hold hands as he recites what you guess is a passage from whatever holy book of Tiamat he got it from and when the time comes, you both accept your place as his wives.\n\nThen the three of you exchange kisses with each other. Most of Bobby’s family claps if they are able. It’s definitely unusual, but it feels so right. You now feel like you belong here.\n\n“Here. I’ve been carrying this in my pocket the whole day, nearly forgot it was there.” Bobby remarks and hands you a ring with a sizable red diamond in the center and smaller black inlayed around it. It’s definitely beautiful and when you try it on, you find that it fits perfectly.\n\n“You…you gave her grandma’s ring?! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! You dishonor that woman! I hope grandma’s spirit comes back and rapes the three of you with a fucking broom handle!” Diana shouts.\n\nBobby ignores Diana and turns to Helen.\n\n“I apologize…I didn’t know I’d be blessed with a second bride today. I don’t have another ring. I’ll have to acquire another.” He says to Helen.\n“Oh that’s okay. I’m just so happy to be married to you at last!” Helen says and squeezes him tightly.\n\nDiana is completely livid.\n\n“Oh fuck this! Fuck ALL of this! FUCK Tiamat! FUCK this family! FUCK my treacherous bitch of a sister! FUCK your blonde whore! And most importantly FUCK YOU BOBBY! FUCK YOU, you fucking fickle cheating bastard. Just fucking kill me now so I can leave this fucking shameful spectacle.\n\nAt this point Bobby calmly pulls out a knife.\n\n“Who wants to do the honors?”\n\nYou take the knife and look over at Helen.\n\n“Did you want to be the one?” you ask Helen.\n“Can we do it together?” Helen asks.\n“Of course.” You answer.\n\nThe pair of you stand and walk over to Diana who has now become silent. You can’t imagine the rage she’s experiencing, but her gaze would burn through you both if it could.\n\nYou raise the knife and then Helen stand behind you and puts one arm around your waist and then one hand on yours that holds the handle so they are like one. You turn your head slightly over your right shoulder to give her a kiss and then together with one single thrust you both jam the knife into Diana’s chest.\n\nThe blade strikes true, puncturing her heart. The hatred still burns in Diana’s eyes as she coughs up blood, wheezing and finally dying. Brandon and Ronald let her body flop to the floor when her life force is gone.\n\nAnd there it is, your first kill.\n\n“Was it good for you?” Helen asks.\n“Oh it was the best.” You say.\n\nAt this point Bobby is completely alert.\n\n“As hot as all this is and despite this being my wedding day…sadly duty comes first and this house has to be put in order. Who knows if we’re going to get attacked again. Let’s start with the clean up.” Bobby orders.\n\nClean up goes relatively fast. Around the house at least since that’s your primary concern. You go for the quick dirty approach of just getting all the dead bodies in one pile outside. You briefly think about burning them, but Bobby says that might attract attention and doing it tomorrow when everyone is more awake enough to defend this place properly is a better idea.\n\nBroken windows and the front door are barricaded with furniture for the night.\n\nSomewhere just after midnight everyone is ready to crash. Bobby, who has been practically sleep walking by this point just tells everyone to sleep with a weapon tonight and you can all just roll the dice without a night watch tonight. Nobody argues.\n\nYou and Helen help Bobby upstairs and three of you collapse on the bed. You and Helen still have a bit of energy left and you briefly consider celebrating your honeymoon without him, but that doesn’t seem quite right despite the fact that you really wanted to finish what was started in this bedroom.\n\nInstead you cuddle up to Bobby who is fast asleep at this point while Helen snuggles next to you. Feeling very loved, you head into dreamland, not even worrying about how Grandma Morningstar might fuck with you tonight.\n",
  "page 216": "You go for the pistol and manage to pick it up. Unfortunately the creature you just beaned in the head has already recovered from its head wound. Much like Helen, you manage to pull the trigger and get a couple shots to its stomach, but it isn’t slowed down and uses all its weight to cause the pair of you to crash to the floor.\n\nYou drop the gun, but you still have the lamp in hand and you attempt to swing it from your prone position, but the creature has already dug its fingers deep into that arm and forcibly holds it to prevent you from doing so. You punch with your other free arm, but your hits to its face do nothing. It just repeats what it has done to your other arm and digs its nails in deeply. With horrible snarling, foam and blood coming from its mouth and more ruthless savagery than you have, the thing soon overpowers you completely and its face meets your own to bite your nose off. You scream in agony as a gout of blood gushes from the new hole in your face.\n\nYour screams soon stop completely when it bites out your throat.\n",
  "page 66": "Quite frankly, you’ll still not sure if this is a good idea, but you can’t stay silent about what you know.\n\n“Julie, I’m about to tell you something very important and I think it’s going to cause a lot of emotions, but please bear with me.” You say and then when you see Julie’s eyes light up you quickly clarify your statement.\n\n“Uh…not that.”\n“…oh…” Julie says disappointed, though she’s going to be even more upset when you reveal what you know.\n\nYou start and stop a couple of times, but eventually you tell her you better just show her. You open the desk back up and hand her the box of photos. Julie goes through them silently for a moment and sits down.\n\n“Julie, I dunno what to say.” You remark.\n“What’s to say? It is what it is. (Sigh) I thought I got rid of all this stuff though.” Julie responds.\n“You…you knew? Why didn’t you ever tell anyone?”\n“Wasn’t like I really knew until after he died and by then I didn’t see the point and I thought it might even fuck up the inheritance he left me. Most of the stuff I found when I did go through it weren’t photos like these, but actual magazines or little girl pictures on his computer. I didn’t even know that he was taking photos of you and other friends.”\n“Wait. So you never knew until after he died? Are you saying he never touched you?”\n“Nope. Never touched me. Never paid much attention to me at all really, he was usually gone on business or otherwise busy as you well know.”\n\nAt this point Julie starts to laugh.\n\n“You wanna hear something really fucked up?”\n“Um…”\n“After I found out my dad was a sicko pedo I got angry and cried as you might expect, but I think a small part of me did so, not because of the horror of such a revelation, but because I thought why didn’t he ever show me as much attention? Why these other girls? I was his daughter. Why wasn’t I…(sob) good enough…” Julie starts to break down.\n\nYou’ve never been one to deny how fucked up your family is and you probably have your own set of “daddy issues” on some level, but right now you don’t think you could have such a twisted way of thinking.\n\nTo be fair to Julie, she probably doesn’t really have some fucked up desire to want to fuck her dad, its just her being fucked up in general. She’s always been so starved for a positive father figure in her life that her mind is bound to go to places that are a little… well fucked up.\n\nJulie goes into full blown sobbing mode and you realize you’re going to have to be the one to console her now.\n\n“Um…there. There, there now. You don’t mean that.” You say sitting down next to her and patting her on the back. She then of course takes to hugging you while crying.\n\n“I mean in his own…incredibly twisted way he did care about you.” You say.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well he left you a shitload of money when he died for one thing. He definitely wanted you to make sure you’d be taken care of if he died. I mean that’s more than my dad did.”\n“Your dad wasn’t a fucking pedo.”\n“No, but I mean…look your father obviously must’ve known what he was was incredibly wrong and he tried to shield you from it by NOT molesting you. His love for you overwrote his sick lust for little girls. It might’ve even been why he was distant. I mean things could’ve been A LOT worse for you if he had taken an unhealthy interest in you.”\n“I…I suppose you’re right. But I just wish…someone could’ve been there for me growing up. I wish my mom hadn’t died when I was little. Maybe it could’ve made the difference of me actually not squandering my youth and acting like brainless whore. All I fucking do is live a shallow existence of hedonism. I don’t even feel good about it anymore. It’s just a never-ending void. I could’ve applied myself to SOMETHING and now the inheritance is starting to run out and I have absolutely no goddamn skills whatsoever.”\n\nThis is pretty heavy stuff coming from Julie. She rarely if ever takes about anything deep, and given how personal all this is it’s a bit out of character. Still, you aren’t entirely surprised she’s coming out to you about it. Crushes aside, Julie probably has always felt a bit of a bond with you due to both your mothers dying early and having distant fathers. True your sister is more in line with her lifestyle, but you grew up with her and were friends with her first and its obvious that deep down she’d like to have something stable in her life.\n\nIn a weird way you both have also shut yourself in from the outside world. Julie may be fucking strangers and partying all the time, but other than that, she barely interacts with the real world in any meaningful way. She was just a “basement dweller” with a shitload of cash.\n\nIn any event you continue to speak with Julie who reveals more about what she knows. She keeps apologizing for her dad taking pictures of you, but you tell her to forget about that now.\n\nShe goes on to say she doesn’t know anything about Vanessa, the little girl in one of the pictures that went missing later. She says she barely remembers ever playing with her. (And to your knowledge you never played with her either).\n\n“So you don’t think he had anything to do with her disappearance?” you ask.\n“I don’t know. I don’t know everything about my father’s sick habits. I mean I know he looked at pictures obviously, but I can’t say if I found anything more than that. Like I never found any hardcore kiddie porn involving actual sex. Though to be honest, it got to a point where I’d found so much that I didn’t want to look anymore. Hence why this office has never really been touched.” Julie says.\n“Hrm. Well I didn’t find anything else other than these photos.”\n\nYou take a glance through the photos again and shake your head realizing that this is probably just going to be one of those dark mysteries of what really happened to Vanessa.\n\nSince neither one of you are really willing to play great detective and don’t want to dwell on this anymore, you and Julie destroy the photos. Afterwards you figure Julie will want to go back to her party since she’ll want lose herself in an alcohol and sex filled night as usual, but this situation has put her out of the mood.\n\n“I’m sure whoever is out there will have fun whether I’m there or not. I just don’t think I’m in the mood. Can I just spend time with you? We could eat this pizza and just talk like how we used to remember?” Julie asks.\n“Well, I suppose that would be okay.” You answer.\n\nSo you and Julie spend the remainder of the night talking. It really isn’t all that bad. It doesn’t even get weird with Julie trying to push for something more, she just maintains a friendly demeanor and nothing more than that. Her spirits are certainly brighter.\n\nEventually you start to get sleepy and even Julie begins to get tired.\n\n“I hate to stop our discussion, but I’m really getting sleepy. It was sort of an eventful day for me.” You say.\n“Sure, I understand, but um…could I ask just one little favor?” Julie asks.\n‘What?”\n“Well, other than the situation that lead to our talk, I really feel like this was a very positive experience for me. I mean like in a long time. I feel like I’ve reconnected with a friend again. I mean REALLY reconnected.”\n“Julie…”\n“I know. I know where you think I’m going with this, but can I just sleep here tonight? I just enjoyed our time together that I don’t really want it to end yet, even if we’ll both be asleep.”\n“I dunno…where are you going to sleep?”\n“Oh, that couch folds out into a bed. I\u0027ll just sleep with you!”\n\nYou give Julie a look of disapproval and disbelief.\n\n“I mean…oh you know what I mean! I’ll just take one side of it! Please! I really won’t try anything honest!”\n\nYou can’t believe you’re actually considering this…\n\n“(Sigh) All right, but ONLY because this is all my fault for dredging up bad memories in the first place and you’re a bit emotional right now. You can sleep on the left side, but DO NOT expect this to be a regular thing and DO NOT think that your hands or any other parts of your body are going to just roam over to my side in the middle of the night. I don’t think I need to tell you what will happen if that happens.”\n“No, and I swear I won’t try anything! Okay, this is gonna be fun! Like a sleep over! Why didn’t we ever have one of those when we were little?”\n“Because my mother was overprotective and I’m starting to think things could’ve been a lot worse for me if she hadn’t been.”\n\nWasting no time, Julie helps you fold the couch out and gets into the bed. You hesitantly get in on the other side and remind Julie not to touch you. Julie though just seems to be thrilled you’re in the same bed together.\n\nDespite your concerns, you eventually fall asleep…\n",
  "page 219": "Parent of Sanity\n\n\nThe Future…\n\n“Mom, are you really sure you want to go to Emberville with me? I mean it’s not exactly a relaxing journey.” Enki asks.\n“You don’t think your mother can handle herself in a fight? I have been living in this post apocalyptic hell longer than you have, you know. Would you rather Aiden and Nadia go with you, because right now they’re the only two not immediately busy.”\n“Yeah I know…don’t really feel like dealing with ongoing private jokes at my expense on the trip. Okay, I guess I’d rather have you along.”\n“Well geez, I guess I should be honored you’re allowing me to come with you.” You remark.\n“I didn’t mean it like that…I just…look, are you fully prepared for this trip?”\n“Of course, I got all my gear and everything. This isn’t the first time I’ve been out of the compound you know. It isn’t even my first trip to Emberville.”\n“Okay, okay, Mom, I get it. You’re a wasteland bad ass, let’s go.”\n\nYou and your son get in the armored car and after a quick wave to one of the Morningstars at the gate you’re soon on your way. You study Enki for a moment just sort of recognizing how much he looks more like you than his father. His personality is certainly more similar to yours as well.\n\nEnki notices you studying him.\n\n“What?” he questions.\n“Nothing son.” You say and then pausing to think of what to say to try to lighten up the mood.\n\n“See? This is nice. How often do we get to spend any quality time together like this anymore? You’re always locked in your workshop tinkering with gadgets and reading. It does us both some good to get out once in awhile.” You say.\n\nEnki just gives you a brief look before turning his attention back to the road. He isn’t convinced that leaving the compound is ever a good idea, and you can’t really blame him, but you’re going to reinforce some life lessons in him today. That is one reason why you came on this trip, another is just so you can get away from Helen gushing about being pregnant for the umpteenth time.\n\nYou take a look behind your seat and see the several crates of berries and apples in the storage area.\n\n“Those Emberville mutants sure enjoy their fruit. They’ll trade just about anything for it, even medicine. Then I suppose medicine is probably the last thing they need now so it makes sense.” You remark.\n“Yeah, well I always feel like some of them are going to dispense with the civility one day and just take all our fruit, along with cooking me up as well.” Enki remarks.\n“Nah…well maybe a few of them, but I think for the most part they know a good ongoing deal.”\n“I guess. I just hate having to make this run. I’d rather be working on improving our compound.”\n“Well in a perfect world, you’d be able to just shut yourself away from it and spend all your time reading those books you gather up from the libraries, but if you’re going to really make it, you have to deal with people…and mutants, you know what I mean. A little diplomacy isn’t a bad thing; it can even turn potential enemies into friends. Trust me I know.” You say.\n“Diplomacy… is that what we’re doing with those trailer park people? I heard Dad’s last raid destroyed some of their trailers and killed a lot of them. Not to mention we got all those captives for sacrifice.”\n“Well, sometimes diplomacy fails, which is why you also have to be prepared for war.”\n“Surprised you didn’t have me help dad instead of doing these runs.”\n“Oh, I’d never allow that even though your father really wanted you to start going on raids with him.”\n\nEnki predictably gets a bit insulted by this remark. It’s silly of course because you know it’s more of a male ego thing, the reality is Enki wouldn’t want to go on raids with his dad either.\n\n“What?!” Enki exclaims.\n“Calm down, I don’t mean it how it sounds. I just mean I’m not having you risking your life on regular shoot outs with a bunch of hostile rednecks.” You say.\n“But…driving to miles to a town full of mutants is perfectly safe?”\n“No, but despite your paranoia, it’s a hell of a lot safer than what your dad and some of your older siblings and cousins are doing. Think about it. Have you actually had any major trouble since you’ve been doing this? Other than a bunch of mutants trying their best to look scary and intimidate you, have you REALLY had any trouble?”\n“Well I had to shoot a few bikers trying to hijack the vehicle once and another time I had to prevent a mutant from stealing a crate of fruit and running off with it.” Enki points out.\n“Hm, glad to hear that you’ve been able to handle yourself, but that’s still a far cry from what your dad has been dealing with.”\n“Yeah I get it, I’m not dad.”\n“No, you’re not. You’re me and that’s a hell of a lot better. Now shut up and listen because this isn’t something you can learn in a book.”\n\nEnki goes back to watching the road while you talk.\n\n“I never really had a great desire for children, I suppose that was one reason why I suggested the current arrangement I have with your father and your aunt Helen. It’s worked out fairly well I think and I know it makes Helen very happy. She gets to be perpetually pregnant and raise children and for the most part I get to avoid it. Well for awhile anyway, see, your father may have a fondness for Helen, but he’ll never love her like he loves me…I think even Helen might know that, but she’s fine with it. Your father REALLY wanted to have a child with me and eventually after some thought to it, I agreed and here you are.”\n“So I’m only here because you let dad impregnate you instead of aunt Helen?” Enki asks.\n“I told you not to interrupt!” you snap.\n\nYou continue.\n\n“Now of course the general assumption was that I’d probably just let Helen take care of you, but I didn’t do that. I gave birth to you, and I felt you were MY responsibility. You and I may be Morningstars by name, but we both know that we’re not really like the rest of them. Think about all your brothers, sisters and cousins, can you honestly say you feel any connection to any of them? I’m not asking if you like, love or even care for them, but don’t you feel disconnected just a little?”\n“Well…I suppose sometimes I do.” Enki says.\n“And that is exactly how I used to feel with my own family a long time ago. I used to hide out from the world as much as possible and I did a good job of it too and then one week…a bunch of shit happened that changed my life forever. Quite frankly if it hadn’t been for your father I’m not sure if I would have even survived it, because I was near totally unprepared when the shit hit the fan.”\n\nEnki looks over at you a bit more interested in what you have to say now. Good.\n\n“I don’t want YOU to ever be that unprepared. Hence why you have to occasionally deal with the outside world no matter how shitty it is. Had I actually been prepared, maybe I could’ve made some better choices. Don’t get me wrong, I think I made the best of a potentially bad situation and I’m happy with your father, and my current life could be a hell of a lot worse, but still sometimes I think: What if?”\n“Doesn’t Tiamat teach us all that life is chaos and that ultimately our choices don’t really matter anyway?” Enki asks.\n“Do you really believe in all that stuff?”\n“Not really.”\n“Which is another example of how you stand out from the rest. You’re intelligent and you’re a potential leader, Enki. You’re not like your siblings…or rather your half siblings. Helen can have as many incest babies as she likes, She can have them in the double digits to match their IQ levels and your father can use them in whatever war he likes. Your life however is much more valuable. You’re MY son and there is only one of you.”\n\nEnki looks at you in not quite disbelief, but something close to it. He knows full well you’ve always had a major hand in directly raising him and teaching him about this harsh new world, but this is probably the first time you’ve come close to expressing a close bond with him. Not in a twisted way like so many of the other Morningstars engage in, but in a normal way.\n\n“I love you son and whether you eventually become head of the family or if you decide to just strike out on your own completely and find your own path doesn’t matter. Don’t get stuck in a rut or allow yourself to feel trapped so you have no options. Ultimately just do what is best for you because that’s all you can do in this world.” You say.\n\nEnki is visibly overcome a bit with emotion. Some eye watering occurs and in true male fashion he turns his head away so you can’t see, which causes you to smile a bit.\n\n“Don’t worry son, you can let your guard down in front of me. Just don’t let those mutants see you like that.” you say.\n“Yeah, definitely wouldn’t want that to happen. Showing weakness in front of them is probably bad for diplomacy.” Enki chuckles and briefly rubs his eyes.\n\nAs you and your son continue on your way to Emberville, you talk much more and can see Enki is going to be just fine.\n\nMaybe you made some concessions to get where you are and you even had some fun doing it, but at least your son knows that he doesn’t have to compromise and can be a master of his own destiny rather than being a slave to circumstance.\n\nEven Grandma Morningstar would approve of that lesson.\n",
  "page 65": "Regardless of what your sister does, you’re not going to get yourself into more trouble by running.\n\n“Look Donna, I can’t stop you from running, but I’m staying here.”\n“What? You can’t do that. You’re supposed to be supportive!”\n“I’m not going to be supportive in your resisting arrest attempt! Now like I said, I won’t stop you, but if you’re going to do it, you’ll be doing it alone.”\n“(Sigh) I should’ve known you’re still the same old goody two shoes that follows all the rules. You’re a goddamn idiot Suzy, one of these assholes just felt me up when he frisked me. You really think if they’re just going to arrest us when they find something? Chances are they’re going to drive us to some secluded area and make us suck their cocks and god knows what else! I’m getting the hell…”\n\nJust as Donna is starting to get up, both cops have taken notice of you two again.\n\n“HEY! I told you to stay put! Don’t give me an excuse!” one of them shouts nearly going for his gun and it’s enough to cause Donna to rethink her actions.\n\n“Despite the pair of you acting mighty suspicious, you appear to be clean and so does the vehicle. Don’t think you’re getting out of a ticket though!” the cop says and shoves a ticket at your sister who takes it. Looks like Donna had a drug free car after all.\n\nAt this point the cop’s partner says to him that they’re needed at the mall since apparently a small riot has broken out there. You are left with another verbal warning and they drive off.\n\nAs for you and your sister, the pair of you get back in the car without another word and continue your drive to Julie’s house in silence.\n\nWhen you arrive, the place is much more subdued than your used to. You don’t even hear loud music coming from inside.\n\n“No party going on?” you ask.\n“Probably will be some folks coming over later. I dunno, even I don’t keep up on it all the time. Anyway, I’m sure you’ll be wanting to hide away before that happens, so like I said your room will be Julie’s dad’s old office. Julie also wants to talk with you as well, so if you’re actually feeling social you could go speak with her before heading off to planet Suzy.” Donna says coldly.\n“…what the hell? Donna, I know you’re pissed, but I really don’t know why. If it hadn’t been for me stalling you from running, you’d be in for a lot more trouble than just a ticket. I’d say it worked out much better.” You say.\n“Right. Your plan worked. Following the rules always works for you. Your life is so great and that’s why you had to beg to move in here.”\n“Uh, you’re living here in JULIE’S house too with no means of support either. I wouldn’t start pointing fingers.”\n“Fuck you Suzy. I thought things were going to be different, but I can see that you’re still the stuck up bitch that thinks she’s better than everyone else.” Donna exclaims and storms off leaving you in the car.\n\nSo much for “sisterly bonding.” This is really an unfortunate turn of events, but not completely unexpected. Donna’s always been a bit bi-polar with you. One moment she’s saying how much you should hang out and bond and the next minute she’s calling you a stuck up bitch that doesn’t know how to have fun.\n\nThe girl has some serious self-esteem issues. Really you have no idea why she still acts the way she does. Mom is dead and so is dad. Who is there to rebel against anymore? From some of what she said earlier it almost seems like she parties out of habit more than great desire anymore.\n\nYou pull your bags out of the car and head on inside. The front room is messy, but not overly so. Your sister is nowhere to be seen, but there are a couple of people you don’t know sitting on one of the couches playing video games. Another one is asleep on the floor. The place smells of spilled beer and none of the people even acknowledge your presence.\n\n“Suzy! You’re here!” a voice suddenly calls out. You look up and see Julie waving from the second floor. She immediately runs down the stairs to greet you close up, nearly tripping in the process.\n\nWhen she gets to you, the years of partying are really starting to take their toll. She’s your age, but she’s starting to look like one of those trashy strippers that wears too much make up.\n\n“Suzy, it’s been too long! Give me a hug!” she exclaims and before you can even react, she gloms on to you and gives you a tight squeeze.\n\n“Mmmm, you smell so nice. Like strawberries.” She says while rubbing her hands across your back.\n“Uh, yeah. Probably the shampoo I used.” You say.\n“You’ve been keeping in shape too, guess Bobby was keeping you busy physically. Ha ha ha ha.” Julie laughs and now she starts getting a little too touchy feelie for you. You’ve already had unwanted touching once today, you don’t feel like more.\n“Yeah, okay good to see you too. Back up there now. I need some space.” You say and start pulling away.\n“Hah same old prudish Suzy. What you think I’m gonna just start sexually assaulting you right here in the living room? Please, I know a girl like you needs to be romanced first!”\n\nJulie jokes, but she’s probably somewhat serious with her playful advances. Shortly after you got with Bobby, Donna told you that Julie spent a couple days crying because she wanted to tell you how she’s always loved you. (You of course weren’t sure why she ever thought you’d be into such a relationship, but apparently before Bobby, everyone just assumed you were a big lesbian.) Of course she quickly went on with her hedonistic life, but you’ve always wondered if she really ever “got over” you.\n\n“Okay Suzy, I hear you’re planning on sleeping in my dad’s old office. You remember the way right?”\n“Yeah I think so.”\n“Oh, I’ll just walk with you, we need to catch up on so much. I’ve missed you, you know!”\n\nResigning yourself to the fact that you’re going to have to at least be friendly to Julie, you walk with her to your new room. Julie of course is very talkative.\n\n“So Suzy, speaking of Bobby, did you make up with him yet?”\n“No and I doubt if it’s going to work out anyway.”\n“Ohhhh, that’s so sad. You two did make a cute couple in a creepy shut in way.” Julie says and begins rubbing your shoulder.\n“Hm, thanks.” You answer.\n“Well, not to worry, you could meet a new boyfriend right here! Contrary to what you might think, I don’t just have mindless party animals coming over here. There’s actually a wide variety of people that come here to hang out. You could meet that special guy tonight in fact! Or girl…you know whatever…” Julie says trailing off and nervously smiles at you.\n\n“Well I’m not really thinking about that right now, I think I’d rather be by myself for awhile.” You answer.\n“Oh yeah sure. I understand. But I just want you to know that my house is your house okay? And all the fun that goes on here, well you can have some of that fun too you know?”\n“I know Julie. Thanks for letting me stay here.”\n“No problem, you were always welcome. Okay well here it is. I’ll leave you to get settled and remember you can always come out and join us later.”\n\nAt this point Julie hugs you again though it’s a quick one this time and briskly walks off.\n\nYou enter the office and see that it is indeed much neater and cleaner than most of the house. Even better that it has a small bathroom attached to it as well, but you knew that since this actually isn’t the first time you’ve been in here.\n\nYou remember playing tag with Julie when you were in elementary school and you both ran in here. Julie’s dad wasn’t angry though. He even gave you a lollipop from a jar on his desk. Come to think of it anytime he saw you, he was always giving you lollipops. He was pretty nice that way. Shame he died in a car accident just as Julie was starting to get wilder, since even if he did work most of the time, you get the impression Julie might at least had some boundaries during her late teens and onward.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for you to rearrange some things and make yourself at home on the fairly comfortable couch in there.\n\nIt also doesn’t take long for you to get back to finishing what Donna interrupted earlier today. (Making sure to lock the door of course)\n\nAfter finishing up and washing up a bit, you hear some music. Sounds like the party is getting started. Continuing to be the introverted personality you usually are, you don’t leave your “safe zone” and go back to playing games on your computer and looking up random shit on the Internet. The more things change the more they stay the same, time passes and it’s almost like you’ve never left the basement!\n\nEventually you get bored doing that and you start looking around the office a bit more. It’s sort of snooping, but then Julie’s dad is dead and you’re sure Julie doesn’t care.\n\nYou start going through the filing cabinets and find that all the paperwork is mainly business files dated back to before Julie’s dad died. Looks like nobody ever bothered to clean any of this stuff out or even go through the stuff.\n\nThe bookshelves aren’t filled with the most interesting of topics. Mostly about economics, business practices, legal things, though some of the books are historical in nature. You don’t see much fiction though.\n\nThe desk just contains regular office supplies. You actually aren’t surprised to find a pistol in there (along with bullets) but after rummaging around a bit you notice a secret compartment in one of the drawers.\n\nYou find a black box and you waste no time in opening it. Inside you find pictures. Pictures of little girls…in fact there are some of YOU! By the looks of them, these were all taken in secret.\n\nNobody is naked in the photos, but given that nearly every single picture of you involves you either sucking or licking a lollipop it’s pretty apparent what the purpose of these were.\n\nSome of these girls are other kids you knew from school and hung out with Julie as well. In fact one of them went missing. Nobody knew who did it, but it was a big deal in town and it probably lead to your mother being even more overprotective of you. And you’re really glad she did since you’re starting to get a sinking feeling about what you’ve uncovered here.\n\n“Christ…” you say going through the photos. You start to wonder now if Julie’s behavior is caused by years of sexual molestation. It would certainly explain a lot.\n\nThen you get a knock on the door.\n\n“Hey Suzy, it’s me Julie, I’ve got something for you.”\n\n“Uh, hold on. Just a minute!” you exclaim as you quickly put the photographs back. You have no idea if you should tell her not, but you open the door.\n\nJulie appears with a bottle of soda and a pizza and walks in.\n\n“I figured you’d stay in here all night, but I thought you might get hungry or thirsty so here you go!” Julie says and places her gifts to you on the desk.\n“Oh. Thanks Julie.” You say.\n“You’re welcome…so why’d you take so long in answering the door? You splittin’ the kitten in here or what?” Julie asks.\n“Hah, yeah well busted I guess.” You say with a fake chuckle.\n“Suzy, if you came out and had some fun with the rest of us, that wouldn’t really be necessary you know. I know you probably still miss Bobby on some level and you’ve got needs, but he’s not here and you’d be better off moving on with your life and getting some free dick out there…or pussy…you know whatever…” Julie says obviously still hoping.\n\nGiven how unstable Julie is at times, you almost wonder if you should address what you found at all. Maybe dredging up bad childhood memories isn’t the best thing right now.\n",
  "page 218": "SATURDAY\n\n\n\"Suzy! You’ve won! You’ve truly overcome all odds! You have not only survived the various uncertain events of this week, but you’ve also thrived! Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give our small town girl some applause and respect for she truly is worthy of it!”\n\nAs the crowd claps, whistles and stomps their feet in support, you sit at a large table by yourself looking at…\n\nA huge plate of those little Vienna sausages.\n\n“Let me guess, they double as looking like oversized clits along with being phallic.” You say.\n\nNo sooner have you said that, when everything disappears and you’re facing Grandma Morningstar in the blasted wasteland again.\n\n“Hey, that’s quick catching on to the symbolism there, blondie.” Grandma Morningstar says.\n“I have my moments. So am I finally done with all this nonsense? Am I finally meeting this Misty?” you say.\n“You figure out who it is yet?”\n“Yeah and I can’t believe I didn’t catch it before. Misty…MISS T…Tiamat.” You answer.\n“Well shit, you’re two for two! Glad to see you’re on a roll and your pretty little blonde head finally got it, but no you don’t get to meet her.”\n“What? After all this build up? Seems pretty anti-climatic.”\n“Yeah, well she’s busy. Besides the jury’s still out on you a bit.”\n“What? Didn’t I win? I’m part of the family now. I mean I killed a bitch for Tiamat, married a pair of siblings and everything!” you say.\n“So? You didn’t like Diana to begin with, it wasn’t like were killing some stranger you didn’t have any grudge against. As far as marrying two of my grand children, well that’s certainly unconventional, but hardly very interesting in the scheme of things. Though I suppose given how boring and repressed your basement dwelling years were you probably think you’re a real wild woman.”\n“So what was the point of all this?!”\n“None really…well I suppose for my own curiosity I did want to see if Bobby’s blonde beauty was even worthy of being in this family and despite what I just said, the fact that you’ve been speaking with me means you’re probably closer to Tiamat than most of them even are. The lot you’re with are practically sheep to be lead around by the nose by Bobby. And Bobby’s so in love with you he’ll do anything for you. I mean sure you added Helen to the mix, but Bobby is always going to love you more. Helen’s just so thrilled to be there that she’s easily pliable as well. I dare say you probably could get either one of them to do what you want if you really pushed for it…but then you sort of already knew that didn’t you?” Grandma Morningstar says with slight smile.\n\nYou don’t say anything for a moment.\n\n“Well it wasn’t all because I felt sorry for Helen and that she gave good head. Helen being a second wife means she can have that whole mess o’ babies Bobby wants. Let her worry about getting fat, stretch marks and the pain of child birth.” You remark.\n“Heh, interesting approach. So I take it you’re going to be the opinionated sexy fun wife while Helen gets to be the submissive, baby and sandwich making one.”\n\"Pretty much.”\n“Well guess you aren’t quite as mediocre as you appear. That’s good. Well maybe Tiamat doesn’t give a shit, but I like you. In fact if I was still alive and decades younger, I’d bend you over and fuck you in the ass raw with a strap on. Make you say my name while I pulled that pretty golden hair of yours. Wouldn’t that be fun?” Grandma Morningstar says with a creepy leer.\n“Um…no.” you just say backing away.\n\nGrandma Morningstar cackles.\n\n“Still prudish as ever. See ya around blondie, I think you’ll be alright.”\n\nGrandma Morningstar waves goodbye to you, disappears and everything around you gets dark.\n\nAnd you wake up.\n\nYou turn your head to the right and see Bobby reading and partially under the blankets. To your left Helen’s face and body is practically on top of your own as she’s still cuddled up next to you and got her arm around you.\n\nWhen you try to move, Helen moves with you.\n\n“Helen, Helen, move your arm, I need to sit up.” You say.\n“Huh? But I like holding you.” Helen says still half asleep.\n“Of course you do, but you still need to move.” You say and forcibly move Helen’s arm. She begins to stir a bit now that you’ve disturbed her comfort.\n\n“It’s about time you got up. You look a little frazzled. Bad dream?” Bobby asks putting his book away.\n“Eh…better than others I’ve had this week. Probably should talk about at some point later, but I’m surprised to see you here. I figured you were going to going to get up early to work on the compound’s defenses.” You say.\n“I didn’t sleep for practically a day remember? Anyway, I did get up earlier and gave everyone their orders of what I want worked on then I told everyone not to disturb me unless cannibals or more asshole family members are trying to wreck the place. So far haven’t had any trouble. Glad to see I don’t have to hover around them constantly. I’m sort of surprised Helen has been asleep all day, she tends to wake up earlier than I do to see to the young ones.” Bobby remarks.\n“I felt I deserved a day off.” Helen remarks starting to become more energetic.\n\nAt this point Bobby brings you closer to him by putting his arm around you. Helen also starts getting gropey again and you’re now the meat in an incest sandwich.\n\n“So how exactly are we doing this?” Bobby asks.\n“Should we take turns?” Helen asks.\n“I don’t see why with a little bit of maneuvering, we can’t all just get our pleasure simultaneously. Helen, you’re still technically a virgin AND you’ve been practically waiting your whole life to get fucked by Bobby, so why don’t we get that out of the way and then at the same time when he’s doing you from behind, you can finish up where we left off yesterday. We can sort of go from there.”\n“Suzy…oh you’re the best! I just love you so much! You’re so thoughtful!” Helen exclaims squeezing you tightly.\n“Hey, okay, okay, you can show your appreciation when your tongue is deep inside me. So, Bobby are you okay with this arrangement?” you say.\n“Sure, but at some point during all of this, THIS is going inside you.” Bobby says pointing at his dick for emphasis.\n“I sure hope so.” You say and kiss Bobby.\n\nThe three of you move around to get into your positions. Helen and Bobby briefly make out a bit and exchange a few sweet words to each other before getting to it. You imagine that this has got to be the best day her life. Actually it’s probably Bobby’s as well, but that’s for different reasons.\n\nAs the three of you enjoy each other’s company, a feeling of satisfaction overcomes you. Not sexual satisfaction…well there is that too, but you genuinely feel good about your situation. You have not one, but two people who love you very much. Helen’s a bit “clingy” but you think you can handle that.\n\nAt one time having a three way with a pair of siblings after killing someone would’ve been unthinkable, but then again it didn’t turn out quite so terrible either. While you’re still not quite into all this Tiamat worshipping, you do have a slightly new outlook on life now.\n\nYou briefly wonder if you’re “evil” for not only going along with all this, but also enjoying it to a small degree, but what other options did you really have? You’re making the best of the current situation and you won’t apologize for it. You’re no longer that basement dwelling “good girl” anymore.\n\nWhile you’re in the middle of riding Bobby’s dick and Helen sucking on one of your tits, that’s when a flash of bright light briefly covers the windows and a loud noise is heard in the distance.\n\n“Shit what the hell was that?” Bobby asks sitting up and rubbing his eyes.\n“I dunno, I’m glad we weren’t looking directly at that flash though. I had my back to the window and that was still fucking bright.” You remark\n\nHelen doesn’t say anything, she’s still just rubbing her eyes, and then Bobby motions you to get off of him.\n\n“Wait a minute, I think I know what it was…” Bobby says and gets up off the bed.\n\nHe walks over to the window and you and Helen follow close behind.\n\nIn the distance to the west, you see the remnants of a mushroom cloud. Probably landed on Security City or near it. You can only guess it probably wasn’t a big one, but you’re still a little concerned if you’re in some sort of fallout radius.\n\n“By Tiamat…” Helen says and squeezes Bobby tightly out of nervousness.\n“So…they finally went and did it.” You say.\n“Looks like. (Sigh) Shit.” Bobby says.\n“What’s wrong? I thought we were prepared for this sort of thing.” You say.\n“Oh we are. I’m not even worried about that, it’s just I wanted to spend the day relaxing with the pair of you. Now? Well I think you know I’m going to have to go and direct everyone. Oh to hell with it, the apocalypse isn’t going anywhere. Let’s go back to what we were doing.”\n“Works for me.” You agree while Helen nods and smiles.\n\nEventually you will have to deal with this new world and whatever its going to throw at you, but for now the three of you are going to get back to enjoying yourselves after this chaotic week.\n",
  "page 67": "You decide this isn’t the time to bring it up. It is a party after all and you don’t want to ruin Julie’s fun just because you’re not feeling so great about several things like Bobby and your fight with your sister.\n\nWell maybe you can get to dealing with Bobby later, but you can still make up with your sister right now, besides you’d rather not linger in here alone with Julie, she might think you’re leading her on.\n\n“Hey Julie, I think I will come and join the festivities.” You say.\n“You will?!” Julie says surprised.\n“Yeah, I’m not saying I’m gonna get wild, but who knows. But what I really want to do is speak with my sister, I had a fight with her earlier.”\n“Hm, yeah I heard. Well I’m sure she’s still out there. Saw her talking to some guy earlier. Don’t know if they hooked up yet though. Probably best if you didn’t disturb her if you catch her in the act as it were.” Julie says.\n“I’m well aware. She’d be even more pissed at me. Okay, see you later.”\n“Yeah, see you later and um, if you want to talk to me I’ll be available anytime.” Julie says looking a bit dejected as you walk out the room.\n\nYeah, probably best you left. You swear, you’re wondering if you’re going to be able to put up with Julie’s crush on you while living in the same house with her, but that will be yet ANOTHER thing to deal with at different time.\n\nYou enter the living room first, which is the most crowded part of the house. The music is up loud a couple people are playing video games on the TV and several people making out on the floor. A few guys come up to you and try to speak, but you brush them off and continue to look for your sister who obviously isn’t in this area.\n\nYou head upstair which isn’t quite as crowded, but the bedrooms are definitely being used for their obvious purpose, and worse nobody even bothers to close the damn doors! (Which certainly draws a few onlookers)\n\nFortunately, the quick glances you do make into the rooms prove to not find your sister, so you head out to the backyard.\n\nThe backyard is a little more relaxed at least in terms of sex and drugs, though a few of the guys are doing some sort of stupid stunts and hurting themselves in the process and then laughing about it. Another guy is filming the whole thing. Several girls look on and shake their heads at the ordeal and telling them that they’re going to really suffer serious injury if they don’t stop.\n\nYou don’t see your sister and you ask one of the girls watching the spectacle.\n\n“Excuse me, do you know Donna?” you ask a woman with short brown hair.\n“Huh? Donna? Skinny little thing that thinks she’s hot shit? Yeah I know her… hey you look a little like her…actually I shouldn’t insult you. You’re actually prettier.” The woman replies.\n“Uh, thanks. Yeah she’s my sister and I was looking for her.”\n“Sister huh? My condolences. Anyway, yeah I think I saw her inside talking with some guy. He didn’t really stand out, in fact he didn’t really look like what she normally goes for, but she was already pretty drunk and when that happens she typically doesn’t give a fuck. Or rather she always gives a fuck. Hah.”\n“Hm, I just looked inside, but I couldn’t find her.”\n“Did you try the basement? She might be down there getting fucked, well assuming Julie isn’t down there getting fucked. Not that it’s ever stopped them from fucking in the same room before.”\n“Uh, no I haven’t checked down there.”\n“Well that’s probably where she is then. Now if you excuse me, I have get back to making sure my idiot boyfriend doesn’t break his goddamn neck.”\n\nYou leave the backyard and head back into the house. You decide you’ve had enough of crowds and if your sister is fucking someone in the basement, you don’t want to interrupt, so you head back to your room.\n\nJust before you reach your room however, a guy about your age opens up the door leading to the basement. Maybe this is the guy your sister was with.\n\n“Hey, is Donna down there?” you ask.\n“Huh? Um, who are you?” the man asks as if you’re interrogating him.\n“Donna. She’s my sister. Someone said she might be in the basement with some guy. Are you him?”\n\nThe man’s demeanor becomes a little more relaxed.\n\n“Oh…wait are you Suzy?” he asks.\n“Yeah.”\n“Yeah, your sister Donna mentioned you when I was talking with her. She wasn’t lying, you are pretty.”\n“Wait, she said that?”\n“Sure, she was very praising of you.” The man says.\n“…Donna? She was praising of me? I find that hard to believe, I just had a fight with her.”\n“Oh. Well maybe she was feeling bad about that, she seemed upset about it when we spoke.”\n\nThe man seems to shift a bit and look sideways a couple times after he says that, and you become suspicious.\n\n“Okay…well I need to go talk with her, but the man suddenly tries to stop you from going any further.\n“Yeah, I don’t think you should. Like I said she’s upset right now.”\n\nYou take a quick glance at the man and see that his clothes are disheveled like he just put them back on in a hurry.\n\n“Funny, I’ve never know my sister to be upset after sex.”\n“What?”\n“Come on, your clothes were obviously put back on in a rush, I know what happened, so if she’s finished with satisfying her urges, she should be in a much better mood to speak with me…”\n\nAt this point the man stops you again.\n\n“Suzy, I don’t like what you’re implying. I never touched your sister. She’s a fucking whore. I was just trying to console her about you. SHE aggressively made the moves on me, but I resisted and then she started crying about what a whore she was and how she could never live up to being like you and screamed that she wanted to be left alone. Now I suggest you do just that, at least until she calms down. She’s a little drunk too, so you probably should just let her sleep it off.”\n\nWhile the man continues to maintain a smile, his tone is somewhat threatening. His whole story stinks of lies and you’re getting a really bad vibe from him. Almost like you did with your uncle Ed.\n\n“Get the hell out of my way. ” You say and push past him to descend down the steps quickly.\n\nUnfortunately you’re not quick enough as the man to manage to shove you in back causing you to lose balance and go crashing down the stairs. While you’re taking a tumble, the man locks the basement door and makes his way down the stairs in a normal fashion. The loud noise from the party ensures that nobody is going to investigate even if they bothered to.\n\nYou break your leg and smash the side of your head against the floor when you finally hit the bottom. You surprisingly don’t scream out from the pain, but you are about to fall unconscious from your head injury.\n\nYour vision is blurry and you feel dizzy, but despite that, you see Donna sprawled out on the floor not that far from you. She’s naked and isn’t moving.\n\n“Don…” you utter and stretch your hand out towards her.\n“I’m sorry it had to be like this Suzy. I really did want us to get off on the right foot. When your whore of a sister Donna was bitching about you to me, you sounded so… perfect. Such a shame…” the man says and then kicks you in the head.\n\nThe blackness takes you and then the man takes your life.\n",
  "page 69": "TUESDAY\n\n\n“…Suzy…” you hear a voice whisper.\n“Mgh.” You answer.\n“Suzy…get up…I have to go pee!” the voice says again. Your eyes are still closed, but you recognize it as Julie’s.\n\n“Guh. Well go! Why do I have to get up?!” you say angrily with your eyes still closed.\n“Well because you arm is wrapped around my waist and your leg is intertwined with one of mine that’s why!”\n\nNow you open your eyes and realize what Julie has just described is true. Julie looks at you over her shoulder.\n\n“Hey don’t blame me, I stayed on my side of the bed. I’d enjoy this longer, but I really gotta pee!”\n“Shit.” You say and remove yourself from your entanglement from Julie’s body. Julie smiles at you and then heads to the bathroom.\n\nGreat, now she’s going to read something into it. Though you do wonder how the hell you got into a spooning position with her. Maybe you were dreaming about Bobby.\n\nSpeaking of Bobby, while you’re checking the time on your cell phone, you see that he’s left messages again. After you recent “night cuddling” with Julie, you think it might be best if you do call Bobby if only to deter Julie from getting any ideas.\n\n“Hello? Bobby?” you say.\n“Yeah.” Bobby answers. He sounds pretty flat.\n“Well you called me, so I assume you wanted to talk to me.”\n“Yeah I did, I wanted to talk to you yesterday about something else, but I’ve changed my mind about some things since then. So I’ve got something new to tell you, and given that you didn’t bother to talk to me yesterday I think you’ll be fine with it.”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“I’m talking about us. Breaking up for good. It’s obvious that this isn’t working. I tried to bring you into my world, but you just refuse to meet me half way.”\n\nYou can’t believe you’re hearing this!\n\n“Meet you half way? You want me to be one of your wives in your fucked up religious cult compound that’s what you want! Face it, you’re not going to give up your sister Diana and that bitch would kill me as soon as I stepped foot in that place!”\n“Well…you obviously have valid points, so why are you arguing with me on this?”\n“Because you’re trying to make out like I’M the bad guy here! I’m not the human sacrificing cultist Bobby and yet I looked past that because I loved you! You say I didn’t try to meet you half way? I proposed long ago that we BOTH leave our fucked up families behind and start a new life together! I was willing to change, YOU weren’t!”\n\nAt this point there is a long pause.\n\n“Well? Don’t you have anything to say?” you ask.\n“No, except…it was just too much. Guess I take after my dad after all. I’m sorry, but my God and family come first. Even before you. I’ll always remember…the good times we had. May Tiamat’s Chaos take mercy on you.”\n“Oh fuck you and Tiamat!” you exclaim and hang up.\n\nIts weird, but you start to sob a little bit. You sort of knew your relationship with Bobby was on borrowed time anyway, but it still hurts now that it’s officially over. He was your first love after all and now that’s gone.\n\nMeanwhile Julie is standing in the bathroom door watching you.\n\n“Suzy, I heard some of that…and I’m truly sorry about you and Bobby. Really, I mean that. You’re a kind and decent girl with many wonderful qualities. He had a treasure in you and he doesn’t know what he’s lost.”\n\nHard to tell if Julie’s just trying to flatter you or she really does mean it, but either way it’s still nice to hear right now.\n\n“Did you want to talk about it?” Julie asks.\n“No, not really. It’s over and that’s that. Best to not dwell on the past and move on right?” you say.\n“Probably. Well I should probably see how much damage my home is in from last night and see who’s still lingering around. I’ll leave you alone.”\n“Wait, I’ll come with you. I mean I live here too now, I might as well help you clean up. Besides, for the first time I think being alone might be a bad idea. I’m just going to end up dwelling on Bobby. I need to keep my mind on other things right now. I probably should try to make up with Donna as well. We kind of argued yesterday.”\n“Yeah, I wondered what happened about that. When she stormed in yesterday I asked about you and she mumbled something about you being a bitch. Then later at the party I asked again about what happened and she still never answered.”\n“Nothing really happened, she just jumped down my throat for a perceived insult, but I guess I should make the peace being the older sister and all.”\n“See? This is why you’re so wonderful!” Julie smiles and the pair of you exit your room.\n\nThe house actually isn’t in bad shape. Julie remarks that usually the parties only get really out of hand on Saturday and Friday nights. She also remarks that she thinks this the first time in quite awhile that she woke up without a hang over since she didn’t really drink as much since she was mainly with you the whole night.\n\n“It’s a bizarre feeling, but I have to say it isn’t an unpleasant one.” Julie says.\n\nFrom the living room you hear the sounds of a vacuum as well as a TV.\n\n“Who the hell would be vacuuming?” Julie asks.\n“Donna?” the moment you say that, you and Julie both look at each other and say “Nah.”\n\nWhen you arrive in the living room, you see a man probably about your age calmly vacuuming as he periodically looks at the TV screen, which is one of those Ground Zero infomercials. There are actually a couple of other people in the room flopped out on the furniture or on the floor still asleep, but the man merely vacuums around their sprawled out legs or bodies. You and Julie find the sight to be quite the peculiar one.\n\nHe notices you both and turns off the vacuum.\n\n“Oh hey. You…you’re the owner of this house correct?” he asks.\n“Yes I am, who are you?” Julie answers.\n“Oh I’m Johnny. Sorry if I woke you and your girlfriend up, but I couldn’t in good conscience leave your house in such a mess. So I found your vacuum and tried to clean up a bit. Sort of a wild party last night huh?” Johnny says.\n“Eh, had wilder. Never had a guest actually clean up though. Kinda weird, but hey I won’t turn it down. I don’t remember you from last night; though I have so many people at my parties I never know half of them anyway.”\n“Oh, I’m not very memorable anyway. I’ve always kind of just blended in with the crowd. I heard about this party from a friend and figured I’d come since I don’t get out much. Did you want me to leave?”\n“Doesn’t make difference to me. Like I said, I’m not going to turn down a guest that helps clean up.”\n\nJohnny nods and returns to cleaning up, while Julie turns back to you.\n\n“Hrm, he’s an odd one, but at least he’s helpful. Anyway, let’s go check and see if Donna’s upstairs.” Julie says.\n\nYou and Julie leave Johnny to his cleaning to go find your sister. After checking the bedrooms, you don’t find her (Though there are a couple of people still sleeping in said bedrooms) you wonder if she passed out on the lawn or something.\n\nYou and Julie start descending down the stairs.\n\n“I dunno, while I’ve certainly passed out on the lawn, Donna has never gotten that bad. She’s more likely to be in the basement.”\n“Well I guess you could look outside and I could look down there for my sister…”\n\nSuddenly Johnny interrupts.\n\n“Excuse me. Sorry for overhearing, but did you say you were looking for Donna?”\n“Yes, she’s my sister.” You say.\n“Oh…so you must be Suzy. Heard her talk about you last night.”\n“Nothing good I’m sure. You know where she is?” you say.\n“Unfortunately I don’t. I mean I remember seeing her leave with a couple of guys and another girl last night, but I didn’t know them either. I was under the impression they were going out to get more beer or drugs or something, but they never came back.”\n\nYou shake your head and sigh.\n\n“Great, she probably got herself fucking arrested by the cops last night.” You say.\n“Well we don’t know that.” Julie remarks.\n“Maybe. I guess I’ll know if I get a call from the police station. Whatever, I know she’s like a cat and always lands on her feet, so I can talk to her later.”\n“You sure you don’t want to still look around the house for her?”\n“Well if she’s here, she’ll probably turn up while I’m cleaning this place a bit.”\n“Okay, well I’m heading back upstairs to get those assholes out of my bed and clean up whatever mess is up there.”\n\nJulie heads back upstairs nodding to Johnny who is now picking up garbage by hand and putting it in a bag. He nods to you briefly and continues his work.\n\nWell mind numbing clean up work should certainly help keep your mind off Bobby (and the possibility of Donna being in jail) you’re just wondering if you should help Julie or Johnny.\n",
  "page 60": "SATURDAY\n\n\nA loud noise in the distance wakes you up and you also notice you’re no longer moving.\n\nA quick look out one of the window and you see something that is going to change your life more than anything else in the world.\n\nA mushroom cloud.\n\nYou’re not feeling any tremors or aftershocks, a wave of fire hasn’t engulfed you, so you’re guessing that it wasn’t excessively close, maybe it was even a small one. Still, you can’t help but wonder if you’re in some sort of deadly radiation radius though. If so there isn’t much that can done about it.\n\n“That’s it then…the world finally went and did it…” you say to yourself.\n\nYou hear some commotion going on outside, presumably several of the carnies are freaking out, arguing, and generally concerned on what to do next. It’s a reasonable reaction to a doomsday situation.\n\nYou calmly get dressed and make your appearance. It takes a moment, but you soon get everyone’s attention.\n\n“Hey! Listen up! This might be the end of civilization as we know it, but it isn’t the end of the world! Sure life is going to be harder now, but when hasn’t it been for us carnies? Why just this damn week we suffered through a military occupation, an internal civil war, an attack by freaks, and avoided another possible attack by a bunch of rednecks. And hell, I had the extra struggle of trying to fit in here and fight off a rape attempt. No way are we going to descend into anarchy again. We’ve come too far.”\n\nYou think you’re getting better at making speeches because this time you’re seeing less frowning faces and general attentiveness.\n\n“We already drift from place to place providing entertainment as a source of our survival well what has really changed? We can still do that. We WILL still do that. This world just got a whole lot shittier and if we can bring a little joy to some people, well they just might be grateful. And if our entertainment value isn’t appreciated, well we ARE nomads and vagabonds by nature. Surely we’ll be picking up, collecting, and scavenging useful material, items and the like to trade in our travels. I know we all have useful skills, surely with those, our ability to learn and adapt and a team effort we’ll be able to keep this carnival…no this FAMILY together a very long time.”\n\n“Yeah! Suzy’s right! We can survive this!” someone shouts and several others agree enthusiastically.\n\nThis time you are not met with apathy, but with applause. At last you have truly been accepted. You half expect them to all shout “One of us.” Over and over, but perhaps that might be a bit too obvious.\n\nIn any case, you and some of the others get together to decide where to head next and what to do about food, and fuel. This isn’t going to be easy, but then this whole week has been a trial for you.\n\nNo longer are you the shy “good” girl who hid away in the basement, harassed by your family and living as one day blurred into the next. You are part of something bigger and not just that, but a leader.\n\nIt’s a brand new day and this is just the beginning of your brand new life.\n",
  "page 61": "Greatest Show On Scorched Earth\n\n\nThe Future…\n\nAfter yet another successful show, the performers of the Cataclysm Carnival begin to pack down for the night and engage in their usual banter.\n\n“Well that was certainly fun. It’s been a long time since we got to actually perform an entire show like that.” Sparkle remarks while putting away her chainsaws.\n“Ha ha ha ha, yeah I wouldn’t exacty call General Hellstorm’s totalitarian city state civilization, but it was a nice change from the usual shanty towns or worse, those Ground Zero owned shelter communities. God, I sometimes wonder what the fuck happened in some of those places after the bombs hit. I swear most of those folks are more fucked up than the people who got caught on the surface.” Randy adds.\n\nHector and Lucy step inside the trailer.\n\n“I imagine being stuck in close quarters with a bunch of people for long periods of time is bound to make a lot of people weird. I mean you don’t have to look too far to see that.” Bruno says after hearing part of the conversation.\n“I hope you remembered to lock up those cat-rat things, this time. Last time they got out and chewed several holes in one of the trailers.” Sparkle says.\n“They’re called Nibblers and yes, I made sure they’re all locked up. I threw in some meat too so they should be good.” Hector remarks.\n“Hrm, I still dunno how you can work with those things. I saw a wild one take off an arm in one bite before.” Randy says.\n“Just gotta show the little bitey bastards whose boss.” Hector says proudly displaying how he still has all ten of his fingers.\n\nLucy says nothing and just walks to the nearest mirror to take her clown make up off. Randy and Sparkle sense something amiss.\n\n“You okay?” Sparkle asks.\n“Shes’s pissed because apparently General Hellstorm was flirting a lot with her hot mom at the end of the night. In fact I’d wager that’s how we landed this job in the first place.”\n“Hector, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t call my mom hot. I told you that before. And I’d REALLY appreciate it if you didn’t imply my mother was a whore!” Lucy says.\n“For fuck’s sake Lucy, I didn’t say she was! I just meant ol’ Hellstorm probably went all soppy when he first saw your mother. She turned on the charm and just reeled in the rube. Shit, we ALL should have such talent when we get to be that age. IF we get to be that age in this shitty world.”\n\n“Ever the flatterer I see, Hector. Glad to know that a woman in their forties still has a place in this rotten world.” You say stepping into the trailer.\n\nHector isn’t quite sure how to react.\n\n“Um, apologies Ringmistress Suzy.”\n“Relax, you don’t ever have to worry about not being charming Hector, you’ll always have your Nibblers to keep you warm. Your father Klepto would’ve been so proud.” You say patting Hector on the head in a condescending manner.\n\nSparkle and Randy both greet you, but your daughter continues to focus on the mirror.\n\n“Anyway, I’m just making the rounds to everyone and I just wanted to say it was a good show tonight and I’m proud of all of you. In fact we might be coming here to perform again in a few more months. Mr. Hellstorm really enjoyed the show. You’d think a guy that goes by the name General Hellstorm would be all WAR DEATH RAGH! But the guy actually is pretty even tempered, well as far as wasteland warlords go anyway.”\n“Hey which act did he like the most? Did he like my chainsaw bit?” Sparkle asks enthusiastically.\n“Heh, well to be honest he wouldn’t stop going on about the freakshow portion. The guy really liked that bit. If there’s one good thing about living in a radiated post apocalyptic landscape, it has got this carnival’s freakshow up and running again. On the pragmatic side of things we also exchanged some of those weird laser weapons we found. We’d never use the damn things, but Hellstorm seemed to really like the idea of them and thought he could get them working so we’ve got food and medical supplies for months. I think Dolores is making a count now…”\n\nWhile you’re explaining the upbeat news, you notice that your daughter is still looking into the mirror and scowling the entire time as she finishes taking off her make up.\n\n“Could the rest of you leave for a moment, I have to speak to Lucy.” You say. Nobody argues and one by one they exit the trailer leaving you alone with Lucy.\n\n“All right, what are you pissed about this time?” you ask.\n“Nothing. Don’t you have some guy to go lick your lips at?” Lucy replies.\n“Not at the moment no, but I’m glad you continue to have such a high opinion of me.”\n“Flirting with power mad warlords, great reason to have a high opinion…” Lucy at this point turns to you with anger in her face.\n“Goddamn it, Dad hasn’t been dead a month and you’re already fawning all over some other man! It was bad enough that you did it when he was alive, but can’t you even respect the dead?!”\n“We’ve been over this MANY times Lucy. I loved your father and I never once was unfaithful to him, but your father would’ve actually understood better than anyone. Show must go on Lucy. Besides I’m not actually doing anything with Hellstorm, except a tease and most likely giving him something to dream about. I’ve always done that to the rubes to get their attention, it’s part of being a ringmaster. Even that idiot Hector gets that, don’t know why you never did.”\n“Because it’s fucking embarrassing to constantly hear the sexual innuendo about your mother from passing rubes about how they’d like to master YOUR ring.”\n“Hmm, hadn’t heard that one before, sort of an obvious pun when you think about it though…” you remark.\n“Stop being so fucking calm about this! I mean…sorry…I just…I mean I KNOW it’s all an act, but I just wish you’d tone it down sometimes.” Lucy says.\n“Believe me, I do. You’ve never seen me in full-blown seductress mode. Look, I’m a big girl and not doing anything that I’m forced to do. (sigh) I know you’re a worldly girl and all, but there’s still a small part of you that’s a bit naïve. Must be a genetic trait passed down from me.”\n“Naïve?”\n“Yes my wonderfully oblivious darling daughter. You seriously believe that nobody is making comments about you? You walk around in a pink and purple skintight outfit with fishnets stockings blowing luminescent bubbles during your act. How do you know that all those lewd remarks are about me? Half of them are probably about you, but you’re so concerned with my actions that you’re too blind to see that you’re just as much of a tease as I am. You’re just unaware of it. Much like I was at your age.”\n\nLucy is suddenly silent at this realization. It’s sort of funny how on the mark you actually were with that statement. You and her father both taught her about this bad new world and she isn’t unintelligent, but for some reason the girl has never really caught on to what a real knock out she is. Perhaps in some way you did shield her a bit from having to be really subjected to the “curse of beauty” since the carnival is a “safe zone” of sorts.\n\n“Back before the world turned to complete shit I pretty much squandered my natural gifts. Now? I’ve used them to my fullest advantage, but not just for myself, but for you AND this carnival that we all call a family. You’re really lucky Lucy, most people nowadays don’t even have a family to look out for them. Shit, even BEFORE the nukes hit, I didn’t have such a luxury, so if I have to give a little peck on the cheek to some petty tyrant to help us survive, then so be it. Better that I do it than YOU having to do it.”\n\nLucy doesn’t reply, she just looks at you. She knows she wouldn’t have the stomach to go through the act that you go through at times. This might be the first time she realizes the sacrifices you’ve made to make her own life easier.\n\nLucy nods a few times before speaking.\n\n“Okay, mom. I get it. And I appreciate it.”\n“Good, that’s all I ask. Okay I’m going back to my own trailer now. We’re heading out tomorrow morning. Get some rest, you deserve it anyway after the wonderful show you put on.”\n“I will mom. Thanks.” Lucy replies.\n\nAs you walk away you see Sparkle, Randy and Hector all slowly sneak back into the trailer.\n\nYou enter your own trailer and lay down on the bed thinking about how far you’ve come in life. It isn’t the life you ever expected, but it isn’t a bad one all things considering.\n\nBefore you fall asleep you look at the old worn clown nose by the nightstand. You grab and squeeze it a couple times, remembering happy times with your now departed husband.\n\n“Goodnight Lance.” You say and slowly drift off with the round red foam ball in your hand.\n",
  "page 64": "It’s really not what you want to do, but if Donna does have drugs in her car like she thinks she does, it’s going to be bad for you whether Donna runs or not.\n\nYou knew you shouldn’t have left the basement!\n\n“Alright, alright, let’s do this, but I don’t think we should run to Julie’s house. I just don’t see it being a safe haven.” You whisper.\n“Okay, okay, I know where we could run to and hide out for awhile. Got a friend by the name of Tina, she works over at the strip club.”\n“Great. Which one?”\n“Kitty City, you know where it is?”\n“Why the hell would I know where a strip club is?”\n“Because we’re going to meet up there! If we run, we can’t run in the same direction! We’ll get caught for sure!”\n“We’re probably going to get caught anyway!” you say.\n\nYour voices start to catch the attention of the officers.\n\n“Hey! Quiet down the pair of you…HEY! COME BACK HERE!” one of the officers shouts as Donna runs off!\n\nYou’re so surprised about her deciding that was the time to start running that you don’t even get the opportunity to stand up from the curb before one officer is already chasing Donna and the other has already pulled out his pistol and commanded you to stay put.\n\nYou meekly put up your hands and lower your head in an attempt to show you have no intention of running.\n\n“I’m not going anywhere. Don’t shoot.” You say nervously.\n\nThe officer sees that you really aren’t a threat puts his gun away, pulls you up roughly by the arm from the curb and throws you into the back of the police car before calling in on his radio about Donna being a runner.\n\nWhile you’re breaking down in tears and worrying about the worst, the officer who threw you into the back of the police car finishes searching Donna’s car. Eventually the other officer comes back as well looking a little worn out.\n\nAfter talking a moment, one of them opens the car door.\n\n“Alright, I didn’t find anything in the car, so why the hell did your friend run?”\n“I…I really don’t know…officer…” you say.\n“Don’t fucking lie to me or this is going to go very badly for you!” the cop warns and its enough to cause you to yelp a little in fear and begin to cry again.\n\n“(sob) My sister…thought you were going to…(sob) find drugs in the car…so she thought it would be better to run. Please I was just driving with her (sob) to find a new place to live! I’ve never done anything (sob) wrong in my life! I’ve…”\n“Alright, alright, shut the hell up and stop your crying. Shit. (Sigh) Well what do you think?” the officer asks his partner who is still trying to catch his breath.\n“Did you call in about the bitch running?”\n“Yeah, but I dunno if anyone’s going to bother chasing down some junkie whore, since it sounds like everyone’s got their hands full especially now that a riot’s broke out at the mall. In fact we’re supposed to go down there and help.”\n“Another fucking riot?! What the fuck is going on in this town? Someone put something in the water?”\n“Seems like it. So what do we do with this one? I mean she’s clean and the car’s clean so…”\n“(Sigh) I dunno. I could think of a few things, but we probably don’t have time for that right now.”\n\nThe officer that chased Donna looks into the backseat at you. He’s being as intimidating as possible and despite him being red in the face and winded it’s working.\n\n“All right blondie, this is your lucky day. Due to the rest of this town seemingly losing its goddamn mind right now and the fact that you’re clean, we’re letting you go. You can take whatever belongings you have in the car, BUT we’re still impounding it if only because your junkie sister made me fucking run several blocks trying to catch her ass.”\n“Got it. And thank you.” You say and start to get out of the car.\n\nBoth of the officers help you out…but it isn’t out of kindness. The pair of them take the opportunity to grope your chest and your ass as you step out of the car.\n\n“Now I suggest you gather your shit, and take your pretty little ass home.” One of the cops says with a leering grin while other laughs.\n\nYou really aren’t in any position to argue, fight or anything else. You hate the fact you just got molested, but you know that if you give them any sort of lip, they’re going to do much worse.\n\nYou quickly get your bags out of Donna’s car and run away from the scene without looking back. When you’re far enough a way, you find some place to sit down and reflect on your situation.\n\nYou try to think of the positive first and that’s namely things could’ve been a lot worse you. You have no doubt that those cops would’ve done more than just feel you up had they been in a less generous mood. So you’re glad you didn’t get jailed, raped or worse.\n\nBut then you think about the negative. First off is your sister who fucking LEFT you there. No hint, no “Now!” no clue at all that she was going to choose that particular time to run. Granted you froze up when it came time to run, but she didn’t even look back. You don’t exactly have the best opinion of her right now putting you in a situation like that.\n\nSecond of all you don’t have a new place to live now or at least you aren’t where you were going to go. As far as you know the offer to live at Julie’s is still open, but it would quite the walk to go there now. A walk that you don’t particularly want to do given the day you’ve had, in fact you’d rather just go back home.\n\nOf course the problem with going back home is you can’t stay there so you’re going to have to go someplace else eventually. Of course maybe Peter would let you borrow his car, but so far your track record with your siblings this weeks hasn’t been great.\n",
  "page 63": "MONDAY\n\n\n“…act now and Ground Zero will provide a…”\n\nClick.\n\nAs you groggily wake up, you’re wondering if you should bother even taking your TV with you considering the stations just play Ground Zero commercials half the time.\n\nYou look at the time and see that you’ve slept for most of the morning, but it doesn’t matter considering your sister isn’t going to pick you up until the afternoon. You just hope that she remembers to come get you period. While your sister isn’t as flaky as Julie, she still doesn’t have the greatest sense of responsibility.\n\nYou also check your phone and see that Bobby’s still trying to reach you, but you still don’t feel like dealing with him. MAYBE later, right now you want to focus on one major decision at a time and moving out of a place where you’ve lived your whole life certainly qualifies.\n\nAll your stuff is packed and ready to go, and since you can’t do much more until your sister gets here, you just wait.\n\nAs you continue to wait, you start to get anxious. You start to worry if you’re making the right decision or not. You start to pace in your room weighing all the pros and cons of what you’re doing.\n\n“Ugh, this is so stressful…I need to calm down…” you say and start unzipping one of your packed bags to get old reliable to relax you.\n\n20 minutes later…\n\n“Hey Suzy?! You down there?” you hear Donna call from upstairs.\n“Huh? Uh what?! Yeah! Hold on!” you exclaim and stop your stress relief session.\n\nAs you hurry to get dressed, Donna continues to call down to you.\n\n“I called you know, why didn’t you answer?”\n“Uh, I guess I didn’t hear it. Sorry about that. Be up in a minute.”\n“I thought you were ready. What were you doing? Splittin’ the kitten down there?” Donna laughs. You don’t answer; you just finish dressing and grab your bags.\n\nWhen you get upstairs, Donna greets you. She’s wearing a shirt that is obviously trying to call attention to her small breasts and pants that are one size too tight to make her ass look like its more filled out, but she’s dressed fairly conservative all things considered.\n\n“Were you just taking what’s in your bags? Because we could probably put more into the car.”\n“Nah, I need to get out of here now. I mean maybe later I could get someone to come get my couch or some of my furniture though.”\n“Okay, but really I don’t think you’ll need to, Julie’s got spare beds and such. Plenty of space you know.”\n“Yeah I know. Let’s get going.”\n\nYou and Donna leave the house and after throwing your bags in her car you and her are soon on your way.\n\nAlong the way Donna puts on some music. She takes mercy on you by not listening to that techno dance crap that you hate so much, but instead listens to the bubble gum pop crap that you hate slightly less.\n\n“So…I found an area of the house where I think you’ll be happiest at yesterday.” Donna says.\n“Oh? Is it the basement?”\n“Hah, nah. That’s being used for other things. I was thinking of Julie’s dad’s old office on the far left of the house. I mean Julie never uses it, and besides a few people wandering from the main party to have a quickie in there it’s never used anymore.”\n“Gee, you make it sound so appealing.”\n“Well it’s either that or one of the upstairs bedrooms and I can’t promise you won’t be disturbed on regular basis there. At least with the office you can lock it and it’s far enough away from the usual party grounds.”\n“I guess it’s the best I can hope for, thanks I guess for thinking ahead.”\n“No problem. You know I’m glad you’re coming to live with us. I mean I know you probably don’t believe it, but I missed talking with you. Julie’s fun and all, but even I get tired from partying ALL the time.”\n“Well thanks Donna…hey this is like the twelfth police car I’ve seen pulled over and cops arresting someone.” You say looking out the window.\n“Yeah, I dunno if you’ve noticed since you tend to hang out in the basement most of the time, but there’s been an increase in crime which also means an increase in the cops using that as an excuse to be assholes… like this. Shit!”\n\nNothing like talking something into existence. A cop car puts on its siren and a bullhorn tells you to pull over. You briefly worry that your sister isn’t going to pull over, but she does. Swearing and sighing the whole time.\n\nDoesn’t take long before a policeman approaches the vehicle.\n\n“Alright where are you going in such a hurry?” the cop asks.\n“Nowhere. I wasn’t even speeding!”\n“Is that right honey? Not according to my radar you weren’t. Besides, you ignored a stop sign back there. I think you need to step out of the car.”\n“Are you kidding me? There wasn’t a stop sign!”\n“Aren’t you supposed to ask for her license and registration first?” you add.\n\nThe cop suddenly points his finger at the both of you.\n\n“The both of you need to shut the hell up right, before I run you both in for obstruction of justice. Now both of you out of the car now!”\n\nYour sister looks at you like she really wants to just try to turn the car back on and try to drive away, but you both know that wouldn’t do any good save for getting yourselves in a whole lot of trouble.\n\nThe cop calls over his partner who looks equally uncompromising. He tells him to search you, while he starts searching the car while he puts Donna up against the car and starts patting down Donna.\n\n“Getting a good feel, you bastard?” Donna remarks.\n\nThe cop frisking you is slightly better, since you don’t get your girl parts molested, but he certainly comes close. He snickers a bit as you tense up from this indignity.\n\nAfter you and your sister have been frisked. They tell you both to go sit on the curb with your hands locked behind your heads while they search the car.\n\nThis is a bad situation anyway since you’re obviously dealing with two asshole cops, but who knows what the hell Donna’s got in her car which will give them even more of an excuse to march you off to jail.\n\nSpeaking of which, Donna whispers to you.\n\n“We need to run.”\n“What?” you ask in a whisper.\n“Those two fuckers are going to find something in the car.”\n“You’re driving with illegal drugs in the car?”\n“Not that much, well at least I don’t think I am…hell I’m not even sure, but I can’t take that chance! We gotta run!”\n“And where the hell are we gonna go?”\n“I dunno! We could probably still hide at Julie’s house.”\n“You’re joking right? That place is probably the first place they’ll look! Shit, Donna! I knew I shouldn’t have left the goddamn basement today!”\n“Look…they’re pretty involved in searching right now. If we ran we could probably at least lose them until we came up with a better idea.”\n\nYou get the impression Donna is going to run no matter what and you can’t see how that’s going to be a good idea in any way. You’re also concerned that if she runs and you stay, these two cops will just pin everything on you (whatever that may be).\n\nStill, if she sees that you’re determined to stay, maybe she’ll keep to her common sense and won’t run too.\n"
