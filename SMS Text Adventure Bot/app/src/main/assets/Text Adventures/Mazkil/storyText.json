  "page 244": "\"We move along the edge, make it to the edge, climb down, and head in to kill the Necromancer.\"\n\n\n\"Climb along the ledge? What a fucking boring way to do it. What are you, a mountain goat?\" Ghazza says disappointedly. \"I suppose it\u0027d work, though.\"\n\n\nYou slowly begin to make your way along the ledge, grasping the wall for handholds. You move slowly, looking down at the zombified guards. Within a few minutes, you\u0027re three thirds of the way across the chamber. Then, the ledge breaks away. A massive scream goes out as a little under two dozen Orcs fall and tumble along the wall. You smack and tumble along the rocks in a painful, brutal fall. Eventually, you roll to a halt, knocking into a pile of corpses that begin to move.\n\n\n\"Fuck!\" You groan loudly, standing up.\n\n\nYou take off your helmet and wipe the blood off your face. You pull two of the Orcs to their feet.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s move. This place becomes a killzone in five seconds.\"\n\n\nThe Zombies descend on you, but you move quickly enough to escape their undead, grasping hands. Not everyone in the group does so, though. A quarter of your group is dragged back by the undead, and you turn to see them brutally beheaded and stabbed through the chest.\n\n\n\"Keep moving.\" Ghazza grunts.\n\n\nYou make your way through the tunnel, abandoning those left behind to their fates. You come to a small room. A large bed, a wardrobe, some drawers, and a partially broken wooden throne sits there, an old man in a black robe there.\n\n\n\"I know you\u0027ve come to send me to the void, to allow the Reaper to triumph over me after I\u0027ve...\"\n\n\nYou roll yours eyes and go to stab him, but Ghazza deflects your blade.\n\n\n\"Let the old man tell his final tale.\" She says.\n\n\n\"Ah, thank you. After I\u0027ve danced around him, using his powers to create soldiers to fight for me. The Great Necromancer does not deserve to life.\"\n\n\nHe takes out a black knife, and tosses it on the ground.\n\n\n\"That\u0027s an Obsidian Blade. It should pass through any of the Grand Necromancer\u0027s wards. Take it, and kill that fucking bitch.\"\n\n\nGhazza chuckles, picking up the knife.\n\n\n\"Alright, Mazkil, do your thing.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and stab the traitor Necromancer through the head. As his life, and power, drains, the zombified guards begin dropping. You hear the dull thud of corpses dropping outside.\n\n\n\"Alright, Orcs. Let\u0027s move.\" Ghazza says, and you turn to leave.\n",
  "page 122": "\"Ah. I thought so. The other men\u0027s testimony said as much. Thank you. Now go, eat.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and quickly return to eat. You have to punch one of the smaller Orcs, but you manage to grab a large, juicy piece of meat and eagerly chew into it.\n",
  "page 243": "You stand at the mouth of a cave, a lit torch in your left hand and an axe in your right.\n\n\n\"Come on boys, into the darkness.\" Ghazza snarls, moving quickly into the cave.\n\n\nYou walk along the cave, seeing only your shadows. You nearly yell as you reach the the edge to a massive drop, but the Orc behind you grabs your arm and yanks you back.\n\n\n\"Thanks.\" You grunt.\n\n\nYou look down off the drop, and notice a small pathway leading to the a massive chamber. The chamber is filled with dozens of corpses lying on the cold stone floor, spread about the room. They all wear rusty and battered armor with weapons clenched in their stone dead hands. There\u0027s also a handful of zombies, walking around with great swords resting on their shoulders. At the end of the chamber is a small tunnel that Ghazza mentions leads to the traitor Necromancer\u0027s room.\n\n\n\"Why hasn\u0027t the traitor raised the dead?\" One of the Orcs asks loudly.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s a doddering old idiot with no strength whatsoever. He doesn\u0027t have the strength to raise and maintain all the dead here. I\u0027m sure if he finds out we\u0027re here, he\u0027ll raise them. New meat, you\u0027ve yet to prove your mettle. What\u0027s your plan?\"\n\n\nYou survey the room. There\u0027s small ledge reaching around the chamber which you could climb along to circumvent the central chamber without alerting the zombified guards. Still, a fall from the ledge could lead to a nasty tumble loud enough to, quite literally, wake the dead. You could also attempt to quickly make your way through the chamber, moving fast enough to avoid the guards.\n",

Rotting hands grab you from behind and pull you away from the group. You feel rotted teeth bite down into the side of your face and you scream.

You quickly slash your sword killing one, kicking another in the head and stomping on his throat repeatedly, crushing it. You stab another one through the chest to kill him, and stab the final one through the eye. As his body hits the ground, you notice a backroom. You open it, to find a small stack of Elvish Jewelry.

One hour passes quickly, the second takes long, but after two and a half hours, the raiders are here. They march, three Caravans in tow, no doubt from a recent raid. They break into a jog when they sight the camp, heading straight into the killzone while confused and unprepared.\n\n\n\"STRIKE!\" You roar.\n\n\nYou break into a run, swinging your blade. The Raiders are surrounded, and they\u0027re simply unprepared to face you. You swing your blade downwards, hacking off an arm, and headbutt a raider before running him through with your sword. You dodge an axe swing and cleave the Orc in half. You launch yourself into the fray, and hack a raider to death. The Raiders are beginning to turn and run now, but you slice the back of the legs of one of them and stab them through the chest, breaking through their armor and into the soft flesh beneath.

You feel a pang in another place, but that\u0027s neither here nor there. You realize that one of, and perhaps the best, duty of the Chieftain is to have a heir to the throne and get married. You\u0027ll try find someone soon enough. Not today, though. You continue strolling around the village, before you notice at the edge of town, a trail of caravans approaching. You raise an eyebrow, as there are no scheduled caravans set to arrive over the next few days. You walk up, and to your surprise, notice the caravaneers are not the Orcs you\u0027re used to seeing.

Which, you so happen to have found.\" Giorgio says, winking.\n\n\n\"You wish to buy blades?\"\n\n\n\"Buy? Not exactly. I doubt you have much use for my gold. I wish to swap, to barter, to trade.\"\n\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\n\"We have much to trade. Food, Drink, Steel, Iron, Wool, Jewelry, Gold, Silver and much, much more. We wish to open up a trade route between here and the Empire.\" Giorgio grins.\n\n\nYou frown. Traders are prone to take advantage of humble villages like yours. The Village is also dedicated to crops, farm work and general self-sufficiency. To increase your smithing and weapons production, you\u0027d need to sacrifice your self-sufficiency. Still, it could increase your village\u0027s profit and the standard of living.\n",

You struggle not to weep for your brother, while Papa kneels down to talk to you. \n\n\n\"You are Chieftain now, Mazkil. Chieftain Mazkil Redblade, leader of the Red Blades. You will lead the tribe to greatness. Tonight, we celebrate. We celebrate your ascension to chieftain, we celebrate the great fight, we celebrate your brother\u0027s journey to the Afterlife. He fought so well I\u0027m sure Gorgok himself is Gruzub\u0027s cup-bearer.\" \n\n\nYou nod. The path you\u0027re going down is set. Gone are dreams of becoming a mercenary or a raider. Now, you are a Chieftain.\n",

Your energy waning, you decide to take one final effort to defeat Gruzub. He swings his sword at your legs, attempting to floor you, but you block the shot and head butt him. He falls backwards, and you swing your blade, smacking into his head. His helmet flies into the air, leaving his head and neck unguarded.

Tribal Necklaces and Beads are around your neck, feeling a lot heavier than they are thanks to the guilt and grief from Gruzub\u0027s death. Papa has vacated his role as chief completely and given all his responsibilities to you, taking Mama and leaving to a small farm up the mountain, leaving you in charge. Still, he\u0027s left you with two lieutenants and advisors, Elder Doct and Thraka Flameborn.\n\n\nElder Doct is an aging Orc, the oldest in your village. She is a traditionalist, who had fond memories of the old days when warriors fought duels for honor and farms were farmed by hand with hoes rather than with mules and donkeys. She values older values like honor, isolationism and keeping the village moral and traditional.\n\n\nThraka Flameborn is the polar opposite of Doct. He is one of the few Orc Mages, specialized in pyromatics and flame-based magics. He is a very modern and progressive orc, who wants for the industrialization and modernization of the village as well as a better relationships with the outside world.\n\n\nThe pair enter the Main Hall, and begin approaching you. Elder Doct is in ancient, dusty armor from his days as a warrior, and has a face like a wrinkled, rotting prune, while Thraka Flameborn is a younger, smaller Orc who looks like a child playing dress up with his father\u0027s red Mage Robes.\n\n\nHuh. Perhaps you are still bitter and angry at the world because of your brother\u0027s death.\n\n\n\"Congratulations at you ascension to Chieftain, Chieftain Mazkil.\" Elder Doct says happily.\n\n\n\"My brother just died.\"\n\n\n\"Oh... Yes, sorry, Chieftain.\" Doct apologizes.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s the issue?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"Raiders have been spotted at the Eastern Woods, by Jagik Longstride. She says they\u0027ve been camped there for at least three days, raiding surrounding farms and market caravans.\" Thraka says.\n\n\n\"What am I to do, then?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"You should grab your sword and lead our warriors to wipe them out.\" Elder Doct says.\n\n\nYou grab your father\u0027s long sword, or your long sword now. It\u0027s a massive steel blade, the blade inscribed with Orc Runes. It\u0027s been handed down your family for four generations, when your great grandfather shattered his family sword on an Elven Shield.\n\n\n\"Where are the men?\"\n\n\n\"Down at the armoury.\" Thraka adds.\n",

Eventually, he sweeps your legs and he falls to the ground. Gruzub raises his sword and swings it, smashing into your chest.

You deserve a much longer, slower death at the hand of someone not as strong and good-lucking as me.\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you, Gruzub.\" You laugh.\n\n\nYou grab the softest woolen tunic you can find and put it on. You walk outside, and wince at the bright son. You spot Gruzub, wearing freshly acquired beads and necklaces to indicate that he is the new chief. He grins when he sees you.\n\n\n\"Mazkil!\" He rushes over to you, and hugs you. \n\n\nYou wince as his hug tightens, but manage to show no pain.\n\n\n\"How\u0027s your new promotion?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s boring.

Will you stay here and help the tribe?\"\n\n\n\"No, the tribe is your place. I want to travel. The Kingdom of Man are desperate for new soldiers to help them fight the Elves.\"\n\n\n\"Hmmm... When are you leaving?\"\n\n\n\"Soon. Very soon. I don\u0027t want to have to go through the whole goodbye deal with the tribe.\"\n\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\nOnce again, you brother pulls you in for a hug.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll miss you.\"\n",

Perhaps you’ll be as good if you do what I say and don’t cause any fights, but make sure to end any we get in.”\n\n\n“Sure thing, sir.” You struggle with the sir part, but you assume it’ll get easy over time.\n\n\n“Sir? Ha, you’re already using sir. I think you’ll impress me, Mazkil.”\n\n\nYou notice a massive Orc that towers over the rest of you, his armor covered with what you assume are kill notches.

You go to leave, but a roof beam collapses down and smacks you in the back and you fall to the knees as the flames begin to sear your flesh.

After a few seconds, the arrows stop, and a large group of Elves begin charging, swords at the ready. You stand, and prepare for the slaughter.\n\n\n\"Come on, Orcs! Let\u0027s give Gorgok a show!\"\n\n\nThe Elves hit the wall of shields like a raging bull, and you stab your blade forward, stabbing one of them through the chest, piercing her heart. You kick forward, hitting one of them in the stomach and knocking your shield forward and smashing him in the face. You grab an Elf by the hair and stab him through the face, before slicing another one\u0027s throat open. Within about ten seconds of brutal fighting, the Elves lie dead. \n\n\n\"Ha! No Orc has died yet! Hold the line!\"\n\n\nAnother small force of Elves begins charging down the pass. These Elves are holding polearms, or swords on long poles. A robed Mage stands in the middle, balls of fire in his hands.\n",

Sir Winston has a plan to avoid all this messiness of slaughter.\"\n\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\n\"Whatever parts of Beast Regiment who are willing, would stay behind at Griglin Pass. It\u0027s a defensible position that could possibly be used by a small force to hold off a much, much larger force for a prolonged period of time.

It would be the ultimate duty to King Alexander.\"\n\n\nCaptain Durrak frowns, and begins thinking.\n\n\n\"I swore my allegiance to the King.

Don! I need one of you with me to hold the Pass. The other must lead the rest of Beast Regiment to retreat with Captain Giles.\"\n\n\nYou mull this choice over.

I was sent to a small graveyard, where a local friendly giant had been buried. One of the Necromancer\u0027s Disciples had taken a group of zombies and ghouls down to raise the giant as a soldier in their army, so I was sent to kill them with my regiment. The dead were everywhere, and I sunk my sword into a zombie and lost it. There I was, unarmed and surrounded by the dead, when I saw this figure in a black cloak. I tackled him, grabbed his sword, this very weapon, and stabbed him to death. With that, the zombies lost their leader and we regrouped and repelled the dead. I wielded this very sword when we stormed Reaper\u0027s Castle and killed that blasted necromancer. Anyhow, that\u0027s my story.

A zombie appears, scraping his axe across your chest, a painful but superfluous move. You thrust your blade forward, impaling him, and you jump into the air and kick off it. You swing your blade, killing another zombie and clearing your path. You grab your throwing axe and fling it, impaling the Necromancer in his neck. He gurgles on his own blood, and he falls off. With the death of the Necromancer, the undead lose control. The Death Knights manage to maintain control over the zombies, but they both quickly begin fighting each other for control of the group. The Scythes fail and within a few minutes the two groups have almost wiped each other out, with only a half dozen zombies left. You quickly disperse of these few undead, and search the corpses. You find some interesting silver jewelry on the Necromancer, your favorite being a silver ruby ring, with the ruby being delicately carved into the shape of a skull. You pocket the jewelry, but decide the ring is worth wearing and eagerly put it on. You feel all the more powerful as you wear it, feeling control over life and death.\n\n\n\"Alright, let\u0027s go.\" You say to yourself, and begin walking.\n\n\nYou raise your hands.\n\n\n\"Alright, alright. I\u0027ll go with you, then.\"\n\n\n\"Good.\" The Necromancer replies, cheerfully surprised. \"Darrington, Flascoe, fetch his weapons and put him on the back of your horse.\"\n\n\nYou pass by miles of endless land desecrated by the many battles that took place during the original Grand Necromancer\u0027s rise to power. Eventually, you come in sight of a massive black stone castle known as the Reaper\u0027s Castle, an unoriginal if accurate name. You find a massive gate, which you decide to knock on. You notice skeletal figures standing on the battlements, bows strung, but they don\u0027t harm you. The Gates begin to open, and a massive army of undead stands in front of you. You quickly realize it\u0027s not a great move to fight, and drop your weapon. One of the Zombies jabs you with a sword, gesturing for you to follow it. You do, and it leads you into the castle, to a black throne, where a black robed figure you recognize as the Grand Necromancer sits.\n\n\n\"Why have you come to my realm?\" He asks.\n\n\n\"I heard you were recruiting mercenaries, and came to offer my services.\"\n\n\n\"Ah. Why is it your first act of service was to kill one of my faithful followers?\"\n\n\n\"He was an annoying ass.\"\n\n\n\"Hmm... Another Orc. You can serve under Ghazza Wanderblade.\"\n\n\nA Zombie wanders forward and extends a rotting hand offering a large bag of gold.\n\n\n\"Here, for your services.\" The Grand Necromancer says. \n\n\nYou take the gold, while listening to the Grand Necromancer. You raise an eyebrow at the Grand Necromancer\u0027s high-pitched voice, but say nothing.\n\n\n\"I have work to do. I\u0027ll have one of the dead take you to your room.\"\n\n\nThe Zombie who paid you beckons you to follow him.\n",
