  "What could be better than a night at the inn, tankard in hand, listening to a bard tell tales of faraway lands and great heroes? His story has it all- brilliant wizards, beastly monsters, and buxom lasses always ready for a smile and a good time. Alright, so I made up the lasses, but the rest is true. "
