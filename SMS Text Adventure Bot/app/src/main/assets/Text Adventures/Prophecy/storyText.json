I have no idea what the fuck that means.\"\n\n\n\"It means there\u0027s twelve times as many Reapers now due to the rate they\u0027re converting more.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, it\u0027s a maths term. Maths is stupid,\" Mira says. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re stupid,\" Dikiz laughs. \"Oh, you know what I miss? Bucket.\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s been gone like a few hours,\" you say. \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t trust those human soldiers with him,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Well we couldn\u0027t bring him with us on our stealth mission,\" you say. \n\n\nYou hear a loud horn far in the distance, on the other side of the mountain.\n\n\n\"Oh look, the humans are about to die,\" Mira says. \"This\u0027ll draw those fucking Reapers away.\"\n\n\nSuddenly, a group of four or five Reapers appear at the top of one of the slopes hanging above the path you\u0027re going down, heading towards the sound of the horn. They snarl when they see you, and charge down. \n\n\n\"You had to fucking say it, didn\u0027t you?\" you complain.\n\n\nOrut snarls as Tilia slides down his shoulder, and you draw your sword. One of the Reapers snarls and leaps through the air with a hiss. \n",

Its skin is like hardened leather, but you grunt and push, managing to force its sword deep into its chest. It rasps, puking black bile onto your face before letting out a final, spasming slash with its claws, slashing open your chest before going limp. You look up, to see Mira finishing off the last one with a decapitating swoop.\n\n\n\"Everyone alright? No one dead?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I\u0027m fine,\" you sigh. \"Let\u0027s keep going.\"\n\n\nYou stand up, climbing back onto Scampers. You break back into a walk towards the top of the mountain.

Fuck, that\u0027s not even realistic, that\u0027s optimistic. Realistically we\u0027re massacred.\"\n\n\n\"You don\u0027t seem particularly sad about that,\" you note.\n\n\n\"Meh,\" she says. \"Centaurs die heroically in battle.

Our gigantic friend lives a violent life as a raider, he would\u0027ve died soon anyway. Ritz is a Ratling who\u0027ll go down as a hero if we take Mol\u0027Chu out with us. He\u0027ll be the greatest Ratling of all time. Better than having survived as a scumfuck raider. Plus, he got to meet me and have some awesome, non-rapey sex, and that was never going to happen any other way. The only real tragedy is Tilly, and that\u0027s not even that bad, because your life would\u0027ve just been flowers and tree-fucking or whatever you guys do.\"\n\n\n\"Holy shit, you are negative,\" Tilia says.\n\n\n\"Well, for some positivity, I hope all of you survive. You\u0027re all my friends. Except Ritz, you\u0027re more like a... fuck bloody plus.\"\n\n\n\"Romantic,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Thanks, Mira,\" Dikiz says. \"It\u0027s been a pleasure to serve with all of you.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve also enjoyed my time out in the world with you,\" Tilly says.\n\n\n\"What she says,\" Orut grunts.\n\n\n\"Uh, can we stop being so fucking gay about this?\" Mira chuckles. \"Come on, let\u0027s speed the fuck up.\"\n\n\n\"I just want to say, this has been the...\" you begin to say, before Mira rides over and flicks your ear.\n\n\n\"None of that shit or no survival sex. Ride on,\" she says.\n\n\n\"I thought you said we weren\u0027t going to survive.\"\n\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Mira says. \"Well that\u0027s a shame. Do you think the others would mind if we went and found a non-freezing rock to fuck on?\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" you smile.\n\n\n\"Shame,\" Mira says, before riding forward.\n\n\nIt\u0027s not long before you reach the mouth of the massive cave.

You said liked the mushrooms!\" Tilly shouts at the big figure.\n\n\n\"Uh... didn\u0027t eat any meat,\" Orut says.\n\n\n\"I can see the fur and blood on your face.\"\n\n\nOrut pauses, running a finger along his lips, before licking the blood it\u0027s accumulated clean.\n\n\n\"Was... growing a mustache, so I shaved it and cut myself,\" Orut says.\n\n\nOrut gleams, proud of his lie, as Tilly just sighs and kicks him. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re heading out!\" the old man says, appearing from his house.\n\n\n\"Cool, let\u0027s go,\" you say, finding Scampers tied up near the stables, thankfully no where near where Orut could grab and devour anything, before heading off towards the mountain.\n",
  "page 722": "\"Can I share a bed with Dikiz?\" you ask.\n\n\nThe old man pauses, thinking. \n\n\n\"Which one is that?\" she asks. \n\n\n\"The Raaz,\" you say, as Mira steps forward.\n\n\n\"Raaz and ratlings can\u0027t interbreed, can they?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"No,\" you say, shaking your head. \n\n\n\"Then of course,\" he says.\n\n\nOne of the hooded figures leads you back to a small, empty house, nodding for you to head inside.\n\n\n\"Do you just have an abundance of spare houses?\"\n\n\n\"There used to be a lot more of us, but many weaker members of the community choose the easy way out. I don\u0027t blame them. There should be anything you need in there.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you say, stepping into the house.\n\n\nDikiz steps in, closing the door behind her. \n\n\n\"Can I be honest?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"Go on,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"I am absolutely terrified of this place. Everyone\u0027s creepy as hell.\"\n\n\n\"They\u0027re not going to kill us. Redmond\u0027s blade said so.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" she says. \"I don\u0027t trust them, though. Do you?\"\n\n\n\"Of course not. What else can we do, though?\"\n\n\n\"I guess you\u0027re right,\" she says. \"Can we just go to bed?\"\n\n\n\"Do you want to...?\" you ask, leaving your question trail off.\n\n\n\"Really? Here?\" Dikiz asks. \"Uh... sure. Damn, we\u0027re dead in the morning either.\"\n\n\nYou pause, recalling your earlier conversation with Flynn.\n\n\n\"Uhh... Dikiz, do you have a... you know.\"\n\n\n\"No,\" Dikiz says, pausing. \"A...\"\n\n\n\"A bumhole,\" you ask.\n\n\nDikiz lets out a chittering noise that you\u0027ve learn signifies embarassment.\n\n\n\"Damn, Ritz, that\u0027s private!\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re a couple!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Well, I do,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Now, follow-up question: can I put my dick in it?\"\n\n\nDikiz stares at you for a moment.\n\n\n\"Umm... yeah?\"\n\n\nWith that, you slink off to the bedroom with Dikiz, curious to see where that\u0027ll go.\n",

It\u0027s less than a minute of walking before you reach the chamber.\n\n\nThe chamber is a large cavern.

Can I start?\" Mira asks.\n\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Redmond says.\n\n\n\"Uh... does anyone have a mirror?\" Mira asks.\n\n\nAnna grabs a pair of mirrors from the carriage, handing it to her and she uses them to read the writings tattooed across her body. Her tongue is strange and harsh, made even stranger by the writings she reads.\n\n\n\"Orut, come here,\" Redmond says.\n\n\nOrut steps forward, as Sir Redmond draws his sword. \n\n\n\"Hold out your hand,\" he says.\n\n\nOrut holds out his hand obediently, and Sir Redmond slices it open, pressing Orut\u0027s hand against the door. The blood begins to fill the grooves, magically sticking to them rather than just dripping down the door.\n\n\n\"Tilia, you\u0027re up next,\" Redmond says. \"Do what we discussed.\"\n\n\nTilly nods, stepping forward and pressing her hands into two grooves in the door not filled with blood, as you begin to hear a loud hum from behind the door.\n\n\n\"Dikiz, give Flynn the key,\" Redmond says.\n\n\nDikiz draws the key from her cloak, handing it nervously to Flynn, who walks up to the door. He takes a deep breath, and you can hear him mumbling to himself, repeating a mantra.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m the chosen one, I\u0027m the chosen one, I\u0027m the chosen one,\" he repeats.\n\n\nIf it wasn\u0027t so tense, you\u0027d laugh.\n\n\nYou watch as Flynn presses his key into the door, twisting it.

Anna walks up to him, squeezing his hand and kissing him on the lip.\n\n\n\"Flynn, you can do this. Slay the bastard and make it a safe world for our little boy.\"\n\n\n\"I will,\" Flynn says, determination flooding into his eyes. \"I love you.\"\n\n\n\"I love you too,\" Anna answers.\n\n\nWith that, Flynn walks forward, his sword in one hand, a torch in the other.

He pauses, staring at her with a smile.\n\n\n\"Oh, my poor, poor dear...\" he says, grinning. \"You gift me with this act and the ending of my duty.\"\n\n\nThe old man collapses to the ground, as the villagers talk begins to get more frantic.\n\n\n\"Mol\u0027Chu talks!

You all stand there, waiting.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll be honest, this is anti-climatic,\" Mira says.\n\n\nYou\u0027re all silent, except for the villagers. The villagers are insanely excited and overjoyed, gleefully talking.\n\n\n\"We did it! The time has come!\"\n\n\n\"We are the last ones!\"\n\n\n\"Praise him! Praise them both!\" the old man cries.\n\n\n\"Them both?\" you ask, pausing as you look at him.\n\n\n\"Yes! They\u0027re both blessed!\" the old man says.\n\n\n\"Flynn and...?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The Chosen One and Mol\u0027Chu, of course! Now that they can meet and the Chosen One can learn the truth, the days of ending can begin! We can finish it! We can get off the knife\u0027s edge!\"\n\n\nYou pause, staring at him as you reach for your sword.\n\n\n\"I fucking knew they were psycho!\" Mira snarls, drawing her swords.\n\n\nMira bounces forward, running her swords through the old man\u0027s chest. He pauses, staring at her with a smile.\n\n\n\"Oh, my poor, poor dear...\" he says, grinning. \"You gift me with this act and the ending of my duty.\"\n\n\nThe old man collapses to the ground, as the villagers talk begins to get more frantic.\n\n\n\"Mol\u0027Chu talks! He talks to us! Slay them! Slay the Chosen One\u0027s allies! It will be our gift to him!\" they say.\n\n\n\"Fuck! We need to fight!\" Redmond spits, as you raise your blade.\n\n\nThe villagers begin to convulse as their bodies mutate. Eyes turn entirely black, teeth sharpen to like knives, claws grow forth as they turn into horrid beasts, laughing and chanting a single word.\n\n\n\"Kill!\" \n\n\nShit, shit shit! It\u0027s too dark to manifest Shadow. You need to do something, quick. \n",
  "page 968": "You step forward, driving your sword through Redmond\u0027s chest, straight through his heart. He gasps, losing his grip on his longsword.\n\n\n\"Uh... good. Get the fuck out of here and finish this. I just want you to know, you were always... like...\"\n\n\nRedmond\u0027s eyes close as he slides off your sword, falling backwards as he rolls and bounces down the mountain. You feel tears well in your eyes, before snarling and turning around.\n\n\n\"Come on! Let\u0027s go!\" you say, rushing to the cave.\n\n\nYour allies turn, rushing towards the cave with you as the Reapers keep coming. You run into the cave as Orut begins rapidly swinging his club, smashing open the cave entrance. The roof of the cave begins to collapse in, closing the cave off from the outside.\n\n\n\"Nice one,\" Tilia says, climbing up and kissing Orut on the side of the head.\n\n\n\"Redmond\u0027s dead,\" Dikiz says. \"We couldn\u0027t save him.\"\n\n\n\"Good,\" a voice says from the darkness. \"It would\u0027ve hurt me to kill him. It\u0027ll hurt me more to kill all you, but it\u0027s my burden.\"\n\n\nFlynn strides forward, holding his sword tightly. He points it at you, frowning. \n\n\n\"Have you come here to kill me?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"No, Flynn! You\u0027re fucked up in the head. Mol\u0027Chu has possessed you. We\u0027re here to help,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Thanks for coming,\" Flynn says. \"I know you\u0027re doing what you think is best for me. But I\u0027m doing what\u0027s best for all of us.\"\n\n\n\"Oh fuck it, Tilia, Dikiz, get to it!\" Mira says, charging forward. \n\n\nMira slashes both her blades, which Flynn manages to roll out of the way to avoid her blades, but then Orut grabs for him. Flynn snarls, as he dodges Orut\u0027s clumsy fingers as Mira charges again, but Flynn slashes his blade, cutting open her side. Tilia begins rapidly chanting her incantations, as Dikiz runs forward alongside you as you slash at Flynn. Flynn blocks your blade, sidestepping Dikiz\u0027s slash before head-butting her and knocking her to the floor.\n\n\nSuddenly, Tilia finishes her incantation, and Flynn spasms. He grunts in pain, falling backwards. Tilia rushes forward, holding some dagger that\u0027s engraved with runes.\n\n\n\"Let the soul that inhabits this vessel take hold again!\" Tilia says, slashing a strange, Eldritch symbol onto his chest.\n\n\nFlynn grunts in pain, before lying still.\n\n\n\"Did it work?\" Dikiz asks.\n",

It\u0027s too dark to see this far away from the torches, but it seems they can see you.\n\n\nA figure tackles you, sending you to the floor. You try to fend him off but your sword has bounced away. You go to claw at his eyes, but he simply shrugs it off, grabbing your head and twisting it until your neck breaks.\n",
  "page 728": "\"Pull back around the doorway!\" you yell.\n\n\nYou pull back, forming a tight circle around the doorway. You and Dikiz grab Anna, pushing her behind you all. \n\n\n\"Get off me! I can fight for fuck\u0027s sake!\" Anna spits.\n\n\n\"Stop being greedy! If you have a death wish I don\u0027t give a fuck, but you can fuck off if you think we\u0027re letting you endanger a kid!\" you say.\n\n\nAnna snarls, but takes her place in the middle as you twirl around to stop a charging beast, slashing at his face.\n\n\n\"Keep fighting!\" Redmond roars.\n\n\nSuddenly, what was once a villager bursts forward, tackling Dikiz and dragging her off from the group.\n",

I don\u0027t blame them. There should be anything you need in there.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks. Goodnight,\" you say, stepping into the house and closing the door behind you.\n\n\nYou look around the old empty house, finding nothing of interest there. You find a small bed, climbing into it and wrapping yourself up, before letting sleep take you.\n",
  "page 713": "You wake up to find yourself lying in your bed furs as the others pack up. You groan, rubbing your eyes as you hop up and begin packing.\n\n\n\"Good morning, sunshine,\" Redmond says. \"Damn, you slept a solid twelve hours. You missed breakfast.\"\n\n\n\"Ah, shit,\" you say.\n\n\n\"There\u0027s a bowl of cold porridge left for you,\" he says.\n\n\nYou pack up, grabbing your bowl of porridge and hopping onto Scampers. You continue along the mountainous path for the rest of the day, stopping only to hunt rams much to Tilly\u0027s displeasure. Eventually, night begins falling.\n\n\n\"We need to set up camp for the night. I can\u0027t see where the fuck I\u0027m going,\" Flynn complains.\n\n\nIn the distance, you see lights at the base of the mountain that holds Mol\u0027Chu.\n\n\n\"I see a village!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Shit, yeah! We can reach that and find a warm place to sleep!\" Mira says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go, then. Double time!\" Redmond shouts.\n\n\nThe group spurs forward, heading straight towards the village. After about an hour of solid riding you finally arrive into the village of thatch-roofed cobblestone houses.\n\n\n\"Fuck, thank the stars,\" Mira says, striding into the village. \"Let\u0027s find an inn or some shit.\"\n\n\nSuddenly, people in black cloaks begin emerging from the buildings, staring at you all.\n\n\n\"Uh, hello,\" Redmond says. \"I am...\"\n\n\n\"Sssh,\" one of the men says. \"The blond one with blue eyes must talk.\"\n\n\n\"Uh... OK,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"You are the Chosen One, yes?\" the man says. \"We welcome you and your companions to the village. We have waited your arrival for a long time for you. You must be exhausted. Come eat with us.\"\n\n\nThe cloaked figures begin walking to one of the largest halls sitting in the town, leaving you all standing there.\n\n\n\"Alright, what are the odds they eat human meat?\" Anna asks, clearly creeped out.\n\n\n\"Humans are good meat,\" Orut Skull-Taker nods.\n\n\n\"No, they\u0027re going to poison us. We\u0027ll share the same food and drink, and then they\u0027ll reveal they\u0027re willing to kill themselves to kill us,\" Mira says.\n\n\n\"Do we eat with them?\" you ask.\n\n\nRedmond draws his sword, riding up to the robed man.\n\n\n\"Do I have your word we\u0027ll be safe here?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"Of course,\" the man replies.\n\n\nRedmond\u0027s sword doesn\u0027t glow, so you continue into the hall. It\u0027s a grand building where dozens of the robed figures crowd around a table. The spare seats are all spaced out so you all have to sit next to robed villagers. Terrific.\n\n\nYou take a seat at one of the seats, next to a villager who looks to be around twenty with a pretty face and dull eyes, and another one who looks to be about twelve. Orut sits at the end of the table on the floor next to Mira thanks to the lack of a seat that can fit them. Villagers bring out iron platters. You half expect them to reveal rotting heads or dead babies, but instead they reveal large, stuffed birds. You grab a leg of turkey, tearing it free of the bird and beginning to gnaw on it. \n\n\n\"You must be hungry,\" the girl says, grabbing another leg as you finish the first and handing it to you. \"Eat.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you say, grabbing the second. \"Aren\u0027t you hungry?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, I have butterflies in my stomach,\" the girl says, grinning happily. \"I\u0027ve waited so long for the Chosen One to arrive. I\u0027ve been so nervous that the Day of Terror would arrive before he was ready. Now, we\u0027re so close to being safe!\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" you nod.\n\n\nSuddenly, the door to the hall opens as a tale, grizzled looking man walks inside, giving a wide grin to show wooden teeth.\n\n\n\"Ah, yes! That\u0027s him! How are you, my man? How are you all?\"\n\n\nThe old man begins to walk around the table, greeting you all.\n\n\n\"Hello, my good sir!\" he says to Redmond, smiling at him. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry for your loss. For the best though, yes?\"\n\n\nRedmond tenses, but doesn\u0027t say anything, perhaps assuming he\u0027s misunderstanding the man.\n\n\n\"Hello, my little Raaz! Enjoy the food! Hello, my centaur friend!\" he says, passing Dikiz and Mira. \"Hello, my giant ogre ally! Eat all you can! If you can walk out of here rather than roll I\u0027ll be disappointed. Hello, little ratling! Fill your belly, my friend! Enjoy!\"\n\n\nThe man pauses, standing next to Anna and Tilly, his face turning to a scowl.\n\n\n\"A nature spirit. Needed for the ritual, I suppose. So stupid, though, so naive...\" he scowls.\n\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Tilly asks.\n\n\n\"Nothing dear, you\u0027re bound by your nature and parents\u0027 teachings. Please, enjoy what vegetables we have.\"\n\n\nThe old man stares at Anna, his face filled with disgust.\n\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" Anna asks.\n\n\n\"If I may speak my tongue, I don\u0027t wish to dishonor a guest, but I just think it is incredibly selfish to bring life into a world like this. Even the chance of dooming him to the infinitesimal risk is horrible.\" \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t have kids,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Oh,\" the man says, pausing. \"My apologies, I thought you were aware. You\u0027re about a month pregnant.\"\n\n\nAnna stops, staring up at him in shock.\n\n\n\"What?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re pregnant,\" he says simply. \"Sorry to be the one to burden you with that. I can have a vial of poison prepared to poison your womb and kill the child. It\u0027s your choice.\"\n\n\n\"Shit, I...\" Anna says, struggling for breath.\n\n\nFlynn stands, hurrying over to grab her hand. Well, it seems they have been busy.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re not going to poison the kid!\" Flynn says, as the old man stands back in surprise.\n\n\n\"If... if you say so,\" he says. \"You should all go to bed.\" \n\n\n\"We\u0027ll be safe, won\u0027t we?\" he says, drawing his sword slightly.\n\n\n\"Of course!\" the man says, as his sword doesn\u0027t glow. \"Come on, follow me to my room, will you?\" \n",

Two, you guys need a medic, and I’m it.”\n\n\n“I’m not risking my child!” Flynn says.\n\n\n“And I’m not risking my fiancé!” Anna says angrily.\n\n\nAnna pauses, realizing what she said.\n\n\n“So, is that a yes then?” Flynn asks. \n\n\n“Look, I don’t know if you realized, kind of embarrassing for you actually, but we’re all still here and can hear you!” Mira says.\n\n\n“Fuck off, Mira,” Anna says, annoyed. “Yes, Flynn, of course it’s a yes.

I... need to tell...\"\n\n\nFlynn\u0027s voice falls to a whisper as he rasps in pain.\n",
  "page 980": "You step forward, swinging the flat of your blade as it slams into the side of his head. He stumbles backwards with a grunt, but doesn\u0027t go down, snarling. Now that you\u0027re in close, he charges forward, smashing into you and knocking you to the floor. He yells, driving his sword through your chest.\n\n\n\"Sorry,\" he sighs as you expire on the floor.\n",
  "page 741": "\"We need to save Flynn!\" you yell.\n\n\nYou turn, running towards the corridor. However, the creature\u0027s have prepared for your attempt to react.

He jabs his fist, punching through the back of your skull and killing you instantly.\n",
  "page 982": "You keep moving as Flynn continues to fail to strike to land a strike. Suddenly, the liquid stone rises up, forming a wall around you and Flynn. Suddenly, it begins pushing you in, forcing you closer and closer. It seems Mol\u0027Chu is eager to finish this.  \n",
  "page 501": "Your shadow strolls ahead, picking out a ratling who stands alond. The ratlings look at the blade with terror, seemingly too terrified to even try block it. The blade suddenly springs to action and strikes in a flurry, slashing repeatedly as it cuts open the ratlings chest repeatedly as he screams, light but very quick and fast strikes as he\u0027s cut apart. He collapses forward to his knees as the sword cuts off both of the ratling\u0027s ears with a quick few strikes. Blood soaks both the creature\u0027s fur and the dirt around it as it collapses to its knees. \n\n\n\"Holy shit! Tug angered the spirits!\" one of the shouts. \"Spirits, I am...!\" \n\n\n\"It\u0027s one of us! It\u0027s one of us!\" the shaman screams, before collapsing to his knees and letting out a sigh. \"Kill the ratling.\"\n\n\nYou try to stand as a ratling moves forward, jabbing his dagger into your back. You let out a desperate groan, collapsing face first into the dirt as your blood mixes into it. \n",
  "page 743": "\"Hold position!\" you yell frantically.\n\n\nYou keep fending off attacks while the group keeps close together. A claw slashes open your arm, but Redmond manages to block the slash that would\u0027ve beheaded you. Tilia has her chest slashed open as she screams before a bit lands in her neck, but Dikiz and Mira manage to pull her back to where Anna is, and Anna begins to tend to her. You side step to avoid a leaping bastard before kneeing him in the head and sending him stumbling backwards. \n\n\nThen, the monsters, or villagers, or whatever they are, pause. They backpedal away from you, collapsing to their knees as they stare down at the tunnel. You watch as Flynn limps down the tunnel. He looks exhausted and haggard, dragging his sword along with him.\n\n\n\"Flynn!\" Anna cries, standing up to run to him.\n\n\nThe rest of you stare nervously at the monsters, your weapons raised.\n\n\n\"They won\u0027t be an issue,\" Flynn says, staring at you all.\n\n\nFlynn looks... broken. His face is a disappointed frown, his eyes filled with sadness. He wraps his arm around Anna, kissing her softly. He looks at each of you, shaking his head slowly.\n\n\n\"Is... is it dead?\" Redmond asks. \n\n\n\"I...\" Flynn begins to say, before stopping. \"I saw things, Redmond. I learned things in there. I understood so little before I ventured in there.\"\n\n\nRedmond holds Anna tightly, hushing her. He seems to loses interest in your, holding his fiancé as if they were the only two left in the world.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s OK...\" he whispers to her. \"It\u0027s over. What was it we decided on for the kid\u0027s name?\"\n\n\n\"Alexander or Julianne,\" Anna says. \n\n\n\"Which do you think it\u0027ll be?\" he says, rocking gently back and forth.\n\n\n\"Uh, a boy, maybe?\" Anna smiles.\n\n\nFlynn nods, closing his eyes.\n\n\n\"I love you, Anna. I love you, Alexander.\"\n\n\nWith those words, Flynn drives his sword straight through Anna\u0027s stomach, impaling her on his sword. Anna gasps, before Flynn puts his lips to hers. Anna collapses to the ground, her eyes staring blankly at the sky. You stare at him in shock, unable to form words.\n\n\n\"You fucking bastard!\" Redmond yells. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"\n\n\n\"He\u0027s moving on,\" Flynn sighs, looking down.\"\n\n\n\"She was with child, you fucking bastard!\" Redmond roars.\n\n\nRedmond walks forward, raising his sword.\n\n\n\"I am in need of your service, Paladin,\" Flynn says, still staring at the ground.\n\n\nRedmond raises his sword, before screaming and dropping it. He screams as he convulses. He begins tearing at his shirt, where you see his chain tattoo sizzling as it burns his skin. The chain stops, and Redmond lies there, panting.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re bound by the rules of the Paladin, Redmond. You swore your life, and more importantly, your soul to me.\"\n\n\nRedmond snarls as he stands, drawing his sword.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Flynn says. \"I\u0027m very sorry. You all mean so much to me. Dikiz and Mira are like the sisters I never had. Ritz, I hated you when I met you because I hated all ratlings. I want you to know you\u0027re like a brother to me now. Tilly and Orut, despite your bizarre nature you\u0027re terrific people and good friends. Sir Redmond, you were the greatest mentor I could ask for,\" Flynn says. \"You won\u0027t understand why I\u0027m doing this. But it\u0027s for all of you.\"\n\n\nFlynn walks forward, raising his sword in an offensive stance. You look around, looking at the others. Tilly seems to be bleeding to death, and Orut\u0027s bare legs have been shredded. Dikiz\u0027s head is battered and she\u0027s clearly dazed and hurt. Mira\u0027s bleeding from multiple claw marks. You look down at yourself, realizing you\u0027re in the best condition.\n\n\n\"Run,\" you say softly, raising your sword. \"I\u0027ll hold them off.\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you,\" Mira spits.\n\n\n\"Trust me! Light the caravan on fire and get out of here!\"\n\n\nFlynn stares at you, sad but curious. He doesn\u0027t even react as Mira throw\u0027s her torch, setting the caravan alight and basking the room in a golden glow. You draw your sword, watching as your Shadow does likewise.\n\n\n\"Go!\" you snarl. \"Get Scampers out as well, got it?\"\n\n\nRealizing you\u0027re not going to leave, the group quickly hightails and runs.\n\n\n\"After them,\" Flynn says, as the villagers burst after them. \"Redmond, we need to kill Ritz.\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you!\" Redmond says, despite aiming his sword at your chest. \"Ritz, I\u0027 can\u0027t stop! Pl...!\"\n\n\n\"Quiet,\" Flynn says, tears filling his eyes.\n",
  "page 985": "You try to keep dodging, but there\u0027s just not enough space. Flynn swings his blade and you try to sidestep only to slam into the tightening walls. You stumble forward before he runs his sword through your chest.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Ritz. It\u0027s for the best,\" he whispers.\n",
  "page 500": "Your shadow drops the sword, as the group begin to freak out, now not even knowing where he is.\n\n\n\"Get guards on me!\" the shaman yells. \"Guard me while I think!\"\n\n\nAs the others stare around frantically you watch the shadows on the floor, watching as a rat brute trods over to guard the shaman, holding his spear tightly in his grip. Your shadow grabs the shaman by the head, ramming it down onto his own guard\u0027s spear, killing him instantly.\n\n\n\"Shit! I didn\u0027t mean to!\"\n\n\n\"What the fuck do we do!?\" one of the ratling yells.\n\n\n\"Spirit of the forest, cursed land, magi, no matter what it is it\u0027s here. Let\u0027s get the fuck out of here!\"\n\n\nWith that, the ratlings turn, quickly bursting off. It\u0027s quite an interesting site to see an entire war-band of ratlings running away from such a small camp. They burst away with the desperate speed only a terrified rat could have. \n\n\nYour shadow cuts you free, before kneeling to return to its natural position. You help untie your friends, and immediately find them with a serious question.\n\n\n“I’m not the only one with questions, am I?” Flynn asks. “What the fuck just happened?”\n\n\n\"The shadows killed them,\" Dikiz says, nerously. \"That was terrifying. Is it... is it still around?\"\n\n\n\"Did you hear the rat? One of us must be a mage,\" Mira says.\n\n\n“It must be the Raaz,” Anna says, pointing a finger at Dikiz. “Ratlings and Centaurs aren’t smart enough to use magic.”\n\n\n“I didn’t do anything!” Dikiz hisses. “That never happened at the Centaur camp, and all of us were there except you!\"\n\n\nThings are getting out of hand.

  "page 745": "You shove Dikiz under the carriage before diving, skidding along under the carriage. Clawed hands reach down to grab at you, although thankfully they\u0027re out of reach.

I was the only person who was able to do this... able to do what needs to be done... you won\u0027t be able to. So, I need you to just not go into Mol\u0027Chu\u0027s inner chamber.

The shadow quickly acts, knocking a ratling aside as it tosses its sword aside and grabbing a spear and running it through one of their heads. The shadow breaks another\u0027s neck before Flynn strikes, slashing at a ratling. The group quickly recovers from the loss, before slowly circling in.\n\n\nSuddenly, Anna appears from the carriage holding two large glass bottles of a milky white liquid, tossing them into the center of the group. The glasses break, releasing a burst of putrid fumes. The gas quickly diffuses over the campfire, quickly reaching you. You cough and splutter, feeling your skin burn. You hear the ratlings yell and scream, realizing the prize isn\u0027t worth dealing with all this toxic gas and the ghosts and immediately begin breaking away, heading off. You have your shadow cut your bindings off and you immediately stumble out of the cloud.\n\n\nAfter a good fifteen minutes of awkward coughing and barely managing to stay conscious, you\u0027re beginning to feel better. The others are disorientated, but ultimately fine. It seems the gas was only a mild irritant. Still, the unknown gas managed to scare off the ratling warband, so that\u0027s a plus.

That makes sense because you’re smart and definitely had a plan going.”\n\n\n“Shit kids, my lungs are filled with gas and I feel really sick,” Mira says. “Any more of this luvie duvie shit and I’ll puke up everything I’ve ate, ever.”\n\n\n“I was going to say, before I was so rudely interrupted, that what the fuck just happened with those floating shit.

Each tribe now claims to be the Great Tribe led by the true Great Chieftain. Hush now, they\u0027re here.\"\n\n\nYou see the Centaurs more clearly now. They\u0027re tanned creatures with flowing long hair with blades and axes clutched in their hands. One of the largest, a massive, muscled beast covered in scars with the lower quarters of a black stallion strolls forward, a massive sword that\u0027s as long as you are tall. He slows down as the others surround you.\n\n\n\"Denir!\" he roars.\n\n\nThe merchant leader smiles nervously, stepping forward. \n\n\n\"Great Chieftain Kildari!\" the merchant leader says.\n\n\nWith lightning speed, the centaur swings the blade, beheading the merchant leader with ease. The merchant leader collapses to the ground. He stares over the merchant caravan, looking at you. He barks out an order in a foreign tongue, before another centaur, this time a female, rides forward. Strangely, her entire body is tattooed with strange runes, the language of the centaurs. Whilst you try to continue staring at her face to avoid a slow and painful death, your eyes do drop to her bouncing tits. It seems clothes aren\u0027t popular among the centaurs.\n\n\nThe two centaurs have a brief conversation, before the Chieftain barks out an order, and a chained human is dragged from the back of a horse and forced to kneel in front of him, before saying something to the man, who nods, clearly terrified.\n\n\n\"Kneel,\" the man says, staring at you. \"You better kneel.\"\n",
  "page 476": "\"I just wanted to talk,\" you say. \"I can leave and come back, or we...\"\n\n\n\"No, no! It\u0027s fine!\" Dikiz says, pushing away her bowl of vomit awkwardly.\n\n\n\"Are you sick, or something?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"No, not exactly. I... um... I kind of need to do this to eat.\"\n\n\n\"Oh. Why?\"\n\n\n\"Well I digest it a bit, then I puke it up, then I digest it. Sorry, it\u0027s gross.\"\n\n\n\"No, it\u0027s fine,\" you say. \"It\u0027s... if I say cute, will you believe me?\"\n\n\n\"No,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Then it\u0027s tolerable,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" Dikiz says, grabbing a wineskin and gargling with it before spitting into the bowl. \"So, what did you want to talk about?\"\n\n\nYou collapse on the floor next to her, looking up at her. \n\n\n\"Whatever. I just wanted to talk to you.\"\n\n\nHer mandibles click together in what you assume is a sign of nervousness.\n\n\n\"Do you want a drink?\" she asks. \n\n\n\"Sure you say,\" taking the wineskin from her and taking a swig.\n\n\n\"Did you mean those things you said the other day?\" she asks. \"I mean, it\u0027s OK...\"\n",

With them, you head down the mountain, towards the decimated and stunned army of Emperor-Regent Damian. Damian himself has been slaughtered, hacked apart in the fight. With no leader, you lead the defeated war host back to the capital along with the twins, Julianne and Alexander. The line to succession has already been so badly damaged that the true “heir” is the grandson of Lesser King Borsichov is next in line, a young, pale, barely seven years old child named Prince Dimitri. Thanks to your immense power, which you display every chance, and your achievements in saving all existence, which you bring up every chance, the king, through his regents, decides to bequeath you all with manors and large plots of land and untold riches, easily taken from Lesser Kings who were already butchered. With that, you\u0027re all given new lives of finery in the new world. It\u0027s decided that, as Dikiz\u0027s time is coming up, living with Tilia and Orut would almost certainly lead to any child\u0027s death at the ogre\u0027s hands or feet, and Mira\u0027s not... \"parent\" material, you\u0027re the one who\u0027ll mind the children.\n",

He has challenged you to one on one combat, the stakes being your lives. Do you accept?\"\n",

As you near the chieftain, he orders you to stop once more through his slave.\n\n\n\"Toss your weapons forward,\" he orders, as you comply, tossing your rat sword into the long grass where a centaur grabs it.\n\n\nThe chieftain nods, before looking at the merchants. He yells an order, and the centaurs and humans charge the terrified merchants. Some attempt to run. Some attempt to fight. None survive the next thirty seconds as the frightening speed of the centaurs and their human allies decimate them. Soon, none are left. One of the human warriors pulls the parchment containing the writings of Steven the Mad out of the carriage.

You are all now prisoners of the Great Tribe! Or maybe that one means slaves, depending on the interpretation. Stay optimistic, I guess.\"\n\n\nOne of the humans ties Redmond up and lifts his groaning body on the back of a horse. Your steeds are tied to the back of several centaurs and led away towards the camp. Your hands are bound behind your back by some more of the tribe, before the chieftain starts talking again.\n\n\n\"Best find a ride among my warriors back to camp, otherwise you\u0027re being dragged.\"\n\n\nHe draws a length of rope from his satchel and tosses it out, making it clear he\u0027s not joking.

Fuck, riding her back isn\u0027t like riding a horse, let alone riding a Great Rat. She doesn\u0027t even have a saddle.\n\n\n\"You better hold on so you don\u0027t fall off and smack your head and end up even dumber,\" she says. \"Or do you expect me to trot all the way to camp?\"\n\n\nYou stare at her naked upper body, and wonder where the fuck you\u0027re going to hold onto.\n\n\nYou wrap your arms around her waist, and she breaks off into a gallop as you struggle to hold on, with the rest of the centaurs following suit. You cling desperately onto her as she continues to gallop. You don\u0027t know how long you ride, but eventually she does begin to slow down as you near a massive city of huge tents in the middle of the plains. She slows down as you breath a sigh of relief, and she slows down to begin navigating the tents, before arriving at the largest. She pulls you off her back and you collapse onto the ground.\n\n\n\"Well, let\u0027s see how this goes,\" she says, as the warrior whose steed carries Redmond comes in. Redmond has regained consciousness, but remains silent as he\u0027s pulled off the horse and tossed on the tent floor, where he remains to his feet being bound together as well as his hands. Flynn and Dikiz arrive next, who are also pushed off their steeds, however the tent empties except for Mira.\n\n\n\"Are we going to die?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve told the Great Chieftain that you are on a quest that does not concern him or his reign. I think he\u0027ll be kind and spare you, although that remains to be seen.\"\n\n\nYou grab Redmond, pulling him up to a kneeling position as the Chieftain walks into the chest. He makes his way to the front of the room, staring at you with interest. His translator hurries after him. He says something in his guttural language, and the translator gets to work once more.\n\n\n\"If you want to live, start talking,\" the slave says.\n\n\nRedmond takes a deep breath, rubbing his bruised head.\n\n\n\"You\u0027ve killed us all,\" he says, sighing.\n\n\nThe slave translates nervously before the chieftain spits on the ground before grunting something.\n\n\n\"Explain or you\u0027ll have your... some organ shoved up your ass so far you can taste it again,\" the translator says.\n\n\n\"The prophecy... there\u0027s an ancient prophecy about a being known as Mol\u0027Chu. The parchment that you threw into the fire was needed to stop him from throwing this entire realm into the pits of horror and suffering.\"\n\n\nThe slave translates this, and the chieftain pauses, confused. The pair exchange a few words, before the slave looks back at Redmond.\n\n\n\"Parchment?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"The paper!\" Redmond says, as you stare daggers at him, hoping he acts more politely to the man who\u0027s going to decide whether you live or die.\n\n\n\"Do... do you mean the skin?\" the slave asks. \"That wasn\u0027t paper. The merchant killed and skinned alive one of the Great Chie...!\"\n\n\nThe chieftain yells at the slave, who jumps nervously and begins apologizing presumably in the centaur\u0027s nonsensical tongue. The chieftain grunts in response, before nodding.\n\n\n\"The Great Chieftain would like me to tell you that the merchants ambushed one of the tribe\u0027s Wise Ones and skinned him alive. We already lost Jirad to an attack from the traitors to the Great Tribe, and since Hiro was killed by the merchant, we only have one left.\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s a Wise One?\" you ask, curiously.\n\n\n\"The tribe scholars. They\u0027re...\" the slave begins to translate.\n\n\n\"Translate!\" the Chieftain shouts, as the slave complies.\n\n\nThe chieftain nods as he listens to the translation, before relaying to the slave that he should answer. Fuck, this whole translation thing is annoying.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re the tribe scholars who studied under the great philosopher Steven the Fair.\"\n\n\n\"Stephen the Fair? Is that what you call him?\" you ask, as the slave nods.\n\n\n\"It is. The Wise Ones continue his traditions. We are have the Wise Ones memorize all of his writings to recite to younglings and teach to their apprentices,\" the slave says.\n\n\n\"If they memorize it, why the fuck did they tattoo it on their skin?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"All three Wise Ones must hold a copy of Steven the Fair\u0027s... uh, the title doesn\u0027t translate well. \u0027Key to what is good in the soul of a world\u0027, which they hold by tattooing it onto their skin in case they\u0027re killed so it can be read. One copy in the common tongue, one copy in the Centauri Runes and one copy in Raaz hieroglyphics, a Wise One for each copy.\"\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s the last one?\" Redmond asks.\n\n\nMira steps forward, flicking her head upwards in a Centaur gesture.\n\n\n\"Last of the Wise Ones, at your service. Or more accurately, it seems you\u0027re at mine, but you humanoids have always loved your manners.\"\n\n\n\"So then, I need her,\" Redmond says. \"I need to know what the tattoos says.\n\n\nThe translator does his thing and the chieftain laughs, before responding through the translator once more.\n\n\n\"The writings are Centaur secrets. Only when the entire tribe lies dead does man deserve to learn what it says to continue that message. Until then, there\u0027s no need for you.\"\n\n\n\"Then come with us! Come with us on our quest to fulfil...!\" Redmond says frantically, before the chieftain bangs a hand against chest.\n\n\n\"The chieftain is tired. He\u0027d like to sleep,\" the translator explains.\n\n\n\"What?\" Redmond says. \"Are we to be released?\"\n\n\nThe slave shakes his head.\n\n\n\"Your arguments have failed to please the chieftain.\"\n\n\n\"So what?\"\n\n\n\"The boy and the rat will most likely be sold or used as slaves. The Raaz will probably be sold back to her Raaz tribe in exchange for goods. You\u0027ll most likely be ransomed back to the Paladin Order.\"\n\n\n\"But I\u0027m on an important mission! He can\u0027t do this!\"\n\n\nThe slave shrugs. before he\u0027s dragged after the chieftain who trots off, seemingly indifferent to his prisoners.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the slave says before he\u0027s dragged off.\n\n\n\"They can\u0027t do this to me!

He\u0027d like to sleep,\" the translator explains.\n\n\n\"What?\" Redmond says. \"Are we to be released?\"\n\n\nThe slave shakes his head.\n\n\n\"Your arguments have failed to please the chieftain.\"\n\n\n\"So what?\"\n\n\n\"The boy and the rat will most likely be sold or used as slaves. The Raaz will probably be sold back to her Raaz tribe in exchange for goods. You\u0027ll most likely be ransomed back to the Paladin Order.\"\n\n\n\"But I\u0027m on an important mission! He can\u0027t do this!\"\n\n\nThe slave shrugs. before he\u0027s dragged after the chieftain who trots off, seemingly indifferent to his prisoners.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the slave says before he\u0027s dragged off.\n\n\n\"They can\u0027t do this to me!

With them, you head down the mountain, towards the decimated and stunned army of Emperor-Regent Damian. Damian himself has been slaughtered, hacked apart in the fight. With no leader, you lead the defeated war host back to the capital along with the twins, Julianne and Alexander. The line to succession has already been so badly damaged that the true “heir” is the grandson of Lesser King Borsichov is next in line, a young, pale, barely seven years old child named Prince Dimitri. Thanks to your immense power, which you display every chance, and your achievements in saving all existence, which you bring up every chance, the king, through his regents, decides to bequeath you all with manors and large plots of land and untold riches, easily taken from Lesser Kings who were already butchered. With that, you\u0027re all given new lives of finery in the new world. It\u0027s decided that, as Dikiz\u0027s time is coming up, living with Tilia and Orut would almost certainly lead to any child\u0027s death at the ogre\u0027s hands or feet, and Mira\u0027s not... \"parent\" material, you\u0027re the one who\u0027ll mind the children.\n",

Is that true?\" the slave asks.\n\n\n\"It is,\" Redmond says.\n\n\n\"Walk forward,\" the slave translates.\n\n\nYou all stand, walking forward. As you near the chieftain, he orders you to stop once more through his slave.\n\n\n\"Toss your weapons forward,\" he orders, as you comply, tossing your rat sword into the long grass where a centaur grabs it.\n\n\nThe chieftain nods, before looking at the merchants. He yells an order, and the centaurs and humans charge the terrified merchants. Some attempt to run. Some attempt to fight. None survive the next thirty seconds as the frightening speed of the centaurs and their human allies decimate them. Soon, none are left. One of the human warriors pulls the parchment containing the writings of Steven the Mad out of the carriage. Then, the tribe begins to set the carriages alight after cutting the horses that pull them free as well your steeds, and they quickly take ablaze\n\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" Redmond says. \"That is very important! I...!\"\n\n\nIgnoring the paladin, the chieftain yells an order and the human holding it tosses it in the fire.\n\n\n\"NO!\" Sir Redmond yells, jumping to his feet.\n\n\nRedmond rushes towards the fire to retrieve it, but a centaur smacks him in the side of the head with the flat of his blade, knocking him to the ground. The Chieftain shrugs, talking again as the slave gets back to translating.\n\n\n\"You are all now... shit, what the fuck does that word mean... oh, prisoners! You are all now prisoners of the Great Tribe! Or maybe that one means slaves, depending on the interpretation. Stay optimistic, I guess.\"\n\n\nOne of the humans ties Redmond up and lifts his groaning body on the back of a horse. Your steeds are tied to the back of several centaurs and led away towards the camp. Your hands are bound behind your back by some more of the tribe, before the chieftain starts talking again.\n\n\n\"Best find a ride among my warriors back to camp, otherwise you\u0027re being dragged.\"\n\n\nHe draws a length of rope from his satchel and tosses it out, making it clear he\u0027s not joking. A female centaur rides forward, grabbing Flynn and pulling him onto her back. The female from earlier rides up to you, staring at you.\n\n\n\"Well? Are you going to hop on for a ride?\"\n\n\n\"You speak normal?\" you ask, confused.\n\n\n\"No, I don\u0027t,\" she says, rolling her eyes.\n\n\n\"But... you do,\" you say confused.\n\n\n\"So you already knew the answer. Don\u0027t act stupid questions, dumbass. So, are you going to to hop on or am I going to have to tie you up and drag you?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll hop on,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Boring. I prefer the guys who like to be tied up,\" she says.\n\n\nYou climb atop her, and she breaks into a trot, nearly sending you falling off. Fuck, riding her back isn\u0027t like riding a horse, let alone riding a Great Rat. She doesn\u0027t even have a saddle.\n\n\n\"You better hold on so you don\u0027t fall off and smack your head and end up even dumber,\" she says. \"Or do you expect me to trot all the way to camp?\"\n\n\nYou stare at her naked upper body, and wonder where the fuck you\u0027re going to hold onto.\n\n\nYou wrap your arms around her waist, and she breaks off into a gallop as you struggle to hold on, with the rest of the centaurs following suit. You cling desperately onto her as she continues to gallop. You don\u0027t know how long you ride, but eventually she does begin to slow down as you near a massive city of huge tents in the middle of the plains. She slows down as you breath a sigh of relief, and she slows down to begin navigating the tents, before arriving at the largest. She pulls you off her back and you collapse onto the ground.\n\n\n\"Well, let\u0027s see how this goes,\" she says, as the warrior whose steed carries Redmond comes in. Redmond has regained consciousness, but remains silent as he\u0027s pulled off the horse and tossed on the tent floor, where he remains to his feet being bound together as well as his hands. Flynn and Dikiz arrive next, who are also pushed off their steeds, however the tent empties except for Mira.\n\n\n\"Are we going to die?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve told the Great Chieftain that you are on a quest that does not concern him or his reign. I think he\u0027ll be kind and spare you, although that remains to be seen.\"\n\n\nYou grab Redmond, pulling him up to a kneeling position as the Chieftain walks into the chest. He makes his way to the front of the room, staring at you with interest. His translator hurries after him. He says something in his guttural language, and the translator gets to work once more.\n\n\n\"If you want to live, start talking,\" the slave says.\n\n\nRedmond takes a deep breath, rubbing his bruised head.\n\n\n\"You\u0027ve killed us all,\" he says, sighing.\n\n\nThe slave translates nervously before the chieftain spits on the ground before grunting something.\n\n\n\"Explain or you\u0027ll have your... some organ shoved up your ass so far you can taste it again,\" the translator says.\n\n\n\"The prophecy... there\u0027s an ancient prophecy about a being known as Mol\u0027Chu. The parchment that you threw into the fire was needed to stop him from throwing this entire realm into the pits of horror and suffering.\"\n\n\nThe slave translates this, and the chieftain pauses, confused. The pair exchange a few words, before the slave looks back at Redmond.\n\n\n\"Parchment?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"The paper!\" Redmond says, as you stare daggers at him, hoping he acts more politely to the man who\u0027s going to decide whether you live or die.\n\n\n\"Do... do you mean the skin?\" the slave asks. \"That wasn\u0027t paper. The merchant killed and skinned alive one of the Great Chie...!\"\n\n\nThe chieftain yells at the slave, who jumps nervously and begins apologizing presumably in the centaur\u0027s nonsensical tongue. The chieftain grunts in response, before nodding.\n\n\n\"The Great Chieftain would like me to tell you that the merchants ambushed one of the tribe\u0027s Wise Ones and skinned him alive. We already lost Jirad to an attack from the traitors to the Great Tribe, and since Hiro was killed by the merchant, we only have one left.\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s a Wise One?\" you ask, curiously.\n\n\n\"The tribe scholars. They\u0027re...\" the slave begins to translate.\n\n\n\"Translate!\" the Chieftain shouts, as the slave complies.\n\n\nThe chieftain nods as he listens to the translation, before relaying to the slave that he should answer. Fuck, this whole translation thing is annoying.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re the tribe scholars who studied under the great philosopher Steven the Fair.\"\n\n\n\"Stephen the Fair? Is that what you call him?\" you ask, as the slave nods.\n\n\n\"It is. The Wise Ones continue his traditions. We are have the Wise Ones memorize all of his writings to recite to younglings and teach to their apprentices,\" the slave says.\n\n\n\"If they memorize it, why the fuck did they tattoo it on their skin?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"All three Wise Ones must hold a copy of Steven the Fair\u0027s... uh, the title doesn\u0027t translate well. \u0027Key to what is good in the soul of a world\u0027, which they hold by tattooing it onto their skin in case they\u0027re killed so it can be read. One copy in the common tongue, one copy in the Centauri Runes and one copy in Raaz hieroglyphics, a Wise One for each copy.\"\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s the last one?\" Redmond asks.\n\n\nMira steps forward, flicking her head upwards in a Centaur gesture.\n\n\n\"Last of the Wise Ones, at your service. Or more accurately, it seems you\u0027re at mine, but you humanoids have always loved your manners.\"\n\n\n\"So then, I need her,\" Redmond says. \"I need to know what the tattoos says.\n\n\nThe translator does his thing and the chieftain laughs, before responding through the translator once more.\n\n\n\"The writings are Centaur secrets. Only when the entire tribe lies dead does man deserve to learn what it says to continue that message. Until then, there\u0027s no need for you.\"\n\n\n\"Then come with us! Come with us on our quest to fulfil...!\" Redmond says frantically, before the chieftain bangs a hand against chest.\n\n\n\"The chieftain is tired. He\u0027d like to sleep,\" the translator explains.\n\n\n\"What?\" Redmond says. \"Are we to be released?\"\n\n\nThe slave shakes his head.\n\n\n\"Your arguments have failed to please the chieftain.\"\n\n\n\"So what?\"\n\n\n\"The boy and the rat will most likely be sold or used as slaves. The Raaz will probably be sold back to her Raaz tribe in exchange for goods. You\u0027ll most likely be ransomed back to the Paladin Order.\"\n\n\n\"But I\u0027m on an important mission! He can\u0027t do this!\"\n\n\nThe slave shrugs. before he\u0027s dragged after the chieftain who trots off, seemingly indifferent to his prisoners.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the slave says before he\u0027s dragged off.\n\n\n\"They can\u0027t do this to me!

It\u0027s yours! Keep the men as well, we\u0027ll fetch a heavy ransom! But leave the women and the child go, won\u0027t you?\" the merchant leader says.\n\n\nBad choice. The boys have taken note of him now, and he\u0027s a fat one. His weight, the fact that he has so much food he can grow weak and fat, only angers you all thanks to the fact that you\u0027re all constantly hungry and eating scraps. One of the ratlings slashes his axe, cutting open the man\u0027s belly in a superficial wound. Another ratling jabs him with a spear, as the boys begin to jab and slash at the man as he yelps in pain as he\u0027s slowly cut and hacked apart.\n\n\nThe torture has drawn the others attention away from the actual carriages.

A centaur lies outside, his equine legs folded up as his body lies on them, a spear on the ground next to him. He seems fast asleep.\n\n\n“Damn,” Mira says. “What a pathetic example of a centaur.

Not too many ratlings have joined the raid, a fact Pak is clearly enjoying as it means he gets to take charge, and since you all get a bigger part of the profit, all the better.\n\n\n\"You, you and you!\" he shouts, selecting three rats from the group. \"Start moving the prisoners back.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" they snarl, as they begin to shout and whip the prisoners into movement.\n\n\n\"You!\" he shouts, pointing a long finger at you. \"Kill the horses.\"\n\n\nYou nod, walking over to the horses.

I need help, and you’re the least heavily guarded.

A centaur lies outside, his equine legs folded up as his body lies on them, a spear on the ground next to him. He seems fast asleep.\n\n\n“Damn,” Mira says. “What a pathetic example of a centaur. Come on, let’s get past him. Grab his spear, first. Then, finish the idiot off for his shitty abilities in staying awake. Or spare him.

You notice they\u0027ve covered themselves in their own urine to keep cool, and are reminded by both the pragmatism and filthiness of your people. The door is unlocked as you once again claw at the centaur who holds you, before you\u0027re tossed into the cell.

What about Flower Power and the giant?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re heading back to the Grove,\" Tilia says.\n\n\n\"You\u0027ll visit me and Dikiz some times, yes?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Of course, Tilia nods, as Orut grunts. \"So you two are staying together?\"\n\n\nYou look at Dikiz, who puts a hand around your shoulder.\n\n\n\"Of course,\" she says.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you smile, before looking at your friends. \"I guess this is it.\"\n\n\n\"It is,\" Dikiz nods. \"It\u0027s been a pleasure to be with all of you.\"\n\n\n\"Definitely,\" you nod.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s cut the goodbyes short. We said \u0027em at the mountain,\" Mira says. \"Goodbye, Ritz and Dikiz.\"\n\n\n\"Goodbye,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Goodbye,\" Tilia says, as Orut grunts.\n\n\n\"Bye, guys.\"\n\n\nWith that, they turn and begin walking off. You watch your friends leave, before turning to look at Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Well, ready to spend the rest of our lives together?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Well actually, there was this Raaz trader in one of the towns we passed who looked a lot cuter than you, and didn\u0027t even have a tai...\"\n\n\nYou laugh, before silencing her with a kiss to her mandibles. You lean back, looking up at the rainy sky with a grin on your face. For a moment, you fear the thought of the sky filling with the booming laughter of some Eldritch being that has found a new plaything, but nothing has happened. You wrap an arm around Dikiz sighing. All you can really do is spend every moment you have enjoying life and with the Raaz who stole your heart.\n\n\nAh, love. What a wonderful thing.\n",
  "page 289": "You creep forward, grabbing the spear lying there by the shaft, lifting it into the air. You take aim at the centaur\u0027s neck, thrusting it forward. It stabs into the creature\u0027s throat as his eyes burst open in shock as blood flows into his throat. He tries to scream, but ends up just lying there, gurgling on his throat as his hind legs give a few kicks. He soon stops moving and you withdraw your spear.\n\n\n\"Good kill,\" Mira remarks. \"Serves the dumb bastard right.\"\n\n\nMira trots into the tent, leaving you there with a bloody spear in your hands. You sigh, walking in after her. You push the tent flap out of your way, walking inside. Suddenly, a hooded figure leaps onto Mira as she yells in surprise. The figure, presumably Dikiz, jabs a dagger into Mira\u0027s back as she screams in pain, bucking quickly and sending Dikiz flying to the ground. Dikiz rolls and slashing at her fore leg. Mira kicks, her hoof slamming into Dikiz head and knocking her back.\n\n\n\"Damn it, you stupid cunt!\" she says, snarling. \"This was a rescue mission!\"\n\n\nDikiz pauses, spotting you. She backs away in surprise, looking confused.\n\n\n\"Ritz? What are you doing here?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re here to get you out of here,\" you explain.\n\n\n\"Oh,\" Dikiz says, dropping her dagger. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\n\"Eat my cunt, you fucking bitch! Rat boy, find me some bandages, would you?\"\n\n\nYou pause, looking around. It seems while you got stuck in a cage, Dikiz was trapped in a palace. The large, spacious tent has a large bed, a wardrobe, a large mirror and several other luxuries.\n\n\n\"Fucking Cestode! Why the hell is Dikiz being treated like this?\"\n\n\n\"Will that help you find something to bandage me up?\" Mira says. \"Get searching, you little shit.\"\n\n\n\"Take it easy!\" you say, cutting a strip of bed cloth free and handing it to her.\n\n\n\"Sorry, whiskers. I\u0027m a bit pissed off today. I feel like I got stabbed in the back and the leg by a cockroach who was too stupid to realize what I was doing,\" she says, wrapping the strip of cloth around her stomach to bandage her wound. \"We have good trading relationships with the Raaz, so we keep their prisoners treated very well to keep that relationship up. If we lose them as a partner we have nothing else.\"\n\n\n\"Where\u0027d you even get a knife in here?\" you ask Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Oh, the flowers in the vase are poisonous. I pressed them into an oil and poured it into the wine.\"\n\n\n\"Flowers and wine? Fuck, you shoved me in a cage filled with dudes covered in piss!\" you say.\n\n\n\"The guards wanted to tie you to the back of them and go for a sprint across the desert,\" Mira says.\n\n\n\"Well anyway, I offered the wine to the guard and knocked him out. I heard you guys coming so I grabbed his knife and hid. Not the best security measures, leaving those flowers in here.\"\n\n\n\"Well see, we didn\u0027t actually know that you were such a flaming faggot that you knew what flowers did what,\" Mira says. \"Fuck, your kind dwell in deserts for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\n\n\n\"Books,\" Mira shrugs. \"I\u0027m sorry for stabbing you.\"\n\n\nMira reaches her arm around, gently dipping her finger into the wound and covering it with flood, which she then flicked at Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Yeah, that apology healed the wound. Te-fucking-rrific. Let\u0027s go.\"\n\n\nMira turns as she begins to trot out of the tent, and you walk after her. You leave the tent, stepping past the dead corpse of the centaur.\n\n\n\"Oh, shit!\" Dikiz says, stepping back. \"What happened to him?\"\n\n\n\"We killed him,\" you say, nodding at the blood that coats your spear.\n\n\n\"Why?! He was unconscious!\" Dikiz says. \"You didn\u0027t have to kill him.\"\n\n\n\"I thought he fell asleep on guard,\" Mira says. \"Instead, he accepted wine from a prisoner. Either way he was a weak fool who deserved to die.\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re escaping from these,\" you remind Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" Dikiz said. \"But there was just no need.\"\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go!\" Mira says.\n\n\nYou continue following Mira through the camp, soon arriving at an opening among the tents under a tarp suspended by several poles. About two dozen humans are there, chained to large stakes in the ground. They\u0027re all asleep. A pair of centaurs lazily stand on guard, mostly fiddling with their swords.\n\n\n\"Play along,\" Mira says, grabbing your spear and tossing it on the ground a few feet away, before putting one of each of her two sword\u0027s to both you and Dikiz\u0027s throat. \n\n\nMira lets out a loud whistle, catching the pair\u0027s attention. The centaurs trot over, both quickly smacking their fist into their chests. They grunt in response, and the pair begin having a brief conversation. They talk briefly, before the two centaurs walk forward. One of them grabs you by the scruff of your neck, lifting you up to stare in your eye. The other slams the flat of her blade into Dikiz\u0027s head, grabbing her. They begin dragging you off back to your respective prisons, leaving Mira to the guard the prisoners. You wonder if she\u0027s turned you in, sacrificed you both to give her the chance to save Flynn. The centaur drags you close to your spear, within grabbing distance.\n",

Flynn pauses, looking at Mira.\n\n\n\"Does that key work for all these chains?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"Yes, but we\u0027re not releasing slaves. We\u0027re barely be able to sneak out of here, let alone all the slaves, plus I\u0027m not crippling my tribe.\"\n\n\nFlynn takes the key from Dikiz, placing it next to one of the sleeping slaves.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s give them a fighting chance,\" he says firmly. \n\n\nMira shrugs, before motioning for you all to follow. You walk after her, shifting through the camp. You all duck behind a large tent as one of the centaurs trots past, but he doesn\u0027t notice you. Then, you hurry on to get your last ally.\n\n\n\"Hey, Ritz,\" Flynn says. \"You know I didn\u0027t mean to insult and punch you, right? I just got startled.\"\n\n\n\"Rat freak?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Yeah, my bad. I grew up in an area with lots of ratling raiders, you know?\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s...\"\n\n\n\"Rat boy and sexy idiot, where are we?\" Mira asks.\n\n\n\"Uh... I don\u0027t know. Near where they\u0027re keeping Sir Redmond, I hope?\"\n\n\n\"More broadly,\" Mira smiles.\n\n\n\"In a Broken Tribe camp?\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s correct. Now when surrounded by endless centaurs and men who want to enslave you who sleep lightly, is this the best time to have this fucking conversation?\"\n\n\n\"Sorry,\" you both say.\n\n\nYou continue on, soon arriving at another large tent. Mira stops, staring at it.\n\n\n\"There should be guards,\" she says.\n\n\nYou move quickly, as you reach the entrance to the tent. Mira pauses.\n\n\n\"Wait here. I\u0027ll check,\" she says.\n\n\nMira trots inside the tent.\n\n\n\"So... we betray her first chance we get?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"She helped us,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Plus, we need her. Her skin\u0027s the writings of Steven the Mad, remember?\"\n\n\n\"Get in here!\" Mira hisses from the inside of the tent.\n\n\nThe trio of you rush inside the tent. Inside, Sir Redmond stands there in a pair of tattered shorts and nothing else, covered in slashes and drenched in blood. His tattoo of a chain of ink wrapped around his body is evident. He holds a sword, pointing it at the four centaurs who surround him, all of who are heavily tattooed with black images of skulls, snakes and other horrific imagery. Mira stands next to you, as they stare at you. Redmond\u0027s eyes flick to you three. There\u0027s a tense moment of silence, before one of the black-tattooed centaurs questions Mira. They have a brief discussion, before all three black-tattooed centaurs spit at her.\n\n\n\"Redmond tries to escape. Unfortunately, he is guarded by the Soul Riders, the finest of the tribe,\" Mira explains.\n\n\n\"Get out of here. Take the centaur and continue the mission,\" Redmond says.\n\n\n\"Oh, fuck off with your petty heroism bullshit!\" Mira says, before breaking forward. She slashes at the first of the Soul Riders, before blocking a strike from a second.\n\n\n\"Attack, you dumb pricks!\" she yells at you. \n\n\nAs Mira and Redmond fight, engaging two of the Soul Riders, the third trots forward, staring at Flynn, Dikiz and you as he raises his barbed sword.\n\n\n\"This unfair,\" he says in your broken tongue. \"They get honor of killing Wise One and Paladin. I get nothing but rat, bug and boy. Pffh.\"\n\n\nWith that, the Soul Rider bursts forward, raising his sword.\n",
  "page 294": "You grab your spear, twisting around to jab it at the bastard\u0027s throat, but it seems she\u0027s trying to tempt you. The centaur lifts you up as soon as your fingers wrap around the spear shaft, before she slashes, hacking open your stomach. You yell as your intestines fall to the earth and stain the ground, before she stabs it through your skull and tosses your limp body to the ground. \n",
  "page 297": "You dodge, as the centaur manages to gracefully stop his charge as you all avoid his first charge. Now split up, he turns his focus to Flynn, ready to charge and kill him. You need to do something.\n",
  "page 296": "You charge forward with a roar, raising your sword in the air, while both Flynn and Dikiz scramble to find weapons other than his fists and her knife for a charge. The Soul Rider stares at you, clearly impressed, but continues charging forward. Unfortunately, you\u0027re a young, inexperienced Ratling, and he\u0027s a massive centaur that has survived hundreds of battles. You slash your sword at his horse half\u0027s chest, cutting a slash across it. His swing, however, separates your upper body from your lower body, sending your top half flying through the air as you\u0027re killed instantly.\n",
  "page 277": "\"So, what\u0027s life like as a slave here, then?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s harsh. You\u0027ll need to work fast and be ready to travel. If exhaustion slows you down, you have a miserable fate awaiting you. We work with the horses, or setting up the camps, or cooking or many other things. You might get sold off. If you\u0027re lucky, the humans will buy you, usually for farm or mine work, but its better than this. They say those who are lazy are sold as feed to the Ogre Tribes, but I don\u0027t believe them.\"\n\n\n\"Terrific,\" you sigh.\n",
  "page 276": "\"How about you go fuck off?\" you say, as the Ratling backs away nervously.\n\n\n\"OK, OK!\" he says, quickly heading to the other side of the cage. \n\n\nYou sigh, realizing you\u0027ve alienated the entire group, before finding a spot in the corner where you shove a ratling with crippled legs out of the way and slump down against the bars, staring aimlessly at the sky. There’s little chatting between the other Ratlings. It seems they work them so hard they don’t have the energy to speak. After about an hour, with the sky turning dark, a centaur rides up to check on you, a burning torch that illuminates the long, stalky grass in his hands. He peers through the bars, staring at all of you, before trotting off. You sigh, but don’t react. However, as soon as you see that light extinguished as the centaur no doubt settles in for the night, a new face appears from the darkness, pressing against the bars.\n\n\n“Hello, little rats,” Mira whispers. “Stay quiet, would you?”\n\n\nThe Ratlings mutter and whisper among each other, but none attempt to make a fuss.\n\n\n“Which of you accompanied the paladin?” she asks.\n\n\nYou cautiously raise your hand, as she smiles.\n\n\n“Perfect, you’re still alive. I need help, and you’re the least heavily guarded. Everyone but him, up against the back of the cage!” Mira says, aggressive but quiet.\n\n\nThe rats comply, pressing themselves against the back of the cage. Mira draws her sword, fumbling to unlock the cage with her free hand, before swinging it open. You step out, and she closes and locks it again.\n\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n\n“I pledged my life to follow Steven the Fair’s writing. In it, he said some day a hero will arrive, and it will be our duty to pass on his writings.”\n\n\n“How do you know that’s us?” you ask.\n\n\n“Not ‘us’. The human boy. Eyes like the sky, hair like gold, a scar on his wrist. The Great Chieftain refuses to listen, but I’m getting you out of here. We need to get the Raaz next. She’s the next least guarded. Then the Chosen One. Then the old man. Then we’ll grab your lower halves and get out of here.”\n\n\n“Lower halves?” you frown, confused.\n\n\nMira pauses, looking to see if you’re serious, before sighing.\n\n\n“Really, genius? Can you seriously not tell what I’m referring to,” she says, flicking her tail for emphasis.\n\n\n“Oh,” you say, embarrassed.\n\n\n“Alright, let’s go,” she says. “Stay quiet.”\n\n\nYou nod, and follow her as you creep through the grass towards one of the tents. A centaur lies outside, his equine legs folded up as his body lies on them, a spear on the ground next to him. He seems fast asleep.\n\n\n“Damn,” Mira says. “What a pathetic example of a centaur. Come on, let’s get past him. Grab his spear, first. Then, finish the idiot off for his shitty abilities in staying awake. Or spare him. Seems like your choice’ll be interesting enough to tell me whether you’re as stupid as I thought you were.\n",
  "page 279": "\"Alright Cotter, I need to know: how the fuck do we get out of here?\"\n\n\nCotter pauses, tilting his head.\n\n\n\"You... you don\u0027t. Clearly,\"\n\n\n\"You have to have some escape plan, right? Some tunnel out of here, some massive plan to riot, something?\"\n\n\n\"There\u0027s no way out.

I got caught returning from a raid. Fuck, those coins I stole only ended up weight me down. Eh, all in the past. Now I\u0027m just trying to survive.\"\n",
  "page 280": "\"Alright, I have no more questions,\" you say.\n\n\n\"OK, cool,\" Cotter says. \"I\u0027m going to head to sleep. I\u0027ll see you in the morning.

The centaurs trot over, both quickly smacking their fist into their chests. They grunt in response, and the pair begin having a brief conversation. They talk briefly, before the two centaurs walk forward. One of them grabs you by the scruff of your neck, lifting you up to stare in your eye.

Mira kicks, her hoof slamming into Dikiz head and knocking her back.\n\n\n\"Damn it, you stupid cunt!\" she says, snarling. \"This was a rescue mission!\"\n\n\nDikiz pauses, spotting you. She backs away in surprise, looking confused.\n\n\n\"Ritz? What are you doing here?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"We\u0027re here to get you out of here,\" you explain.\n\n\n\"Oh,\" Dikiz says, dropping her dagger. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\n\"Eat my cunt, you fucking bitch! Rat boy, find me some bandages, would you?\"\n\n\nYou pause, looking around. It seems while you got stuck in a cage, Dikiz was trapped in a palace.

I\u0027m a bit pissed off today. I feel like I got stabbed in the back and the leg by a cockroach who was too stupid to realize what I was doing,\" she says, wrapping the strip of cloth around her stomach to bandage her wound. \"We have good trading relationships with the Raaz, so we keep their prisoners treated very well to keep that relationship up. If we lose them as a partner we have nothing else.\"\n\n\n\"Where\u0027d you even get a knife in here?\" you ask Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Oh, the flowers in the vase are poisonous. I pressed them into an oil and poured it into the wine.\"\n\n\n\"Flowers and wine? Fuck, you shoved me in a cage filled with dudes covered in piss!\" you say.\n\n\n\"The guards wanted to tie you to the back of them and go for a sprint across the desert,\" Mira says.\n\n\n\"Well anyway, I offered the wine to the guard and knocked him out. I heard you guys coming so I grabbed his knife and hid. Not the best security measures, leaving those flowers in here.\"\n\n\n\"Well see, we didn\u0027t actually know that you were such a flaming faggot that you knew what flowers did what,\" Mira says. \"Fuck, your kind dwell in deserts for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\n\n\n\"Books,\" Mira shrugs. \"I\u0027m sorry for stabbing you.\"\n\n\nMira reaches her arm around, gently dipping her finger into the wound and covering it with flood, which she then flicked at Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Yeah, that apology healed the wound. Te-fucking-rrific. Let\u0027s go.\"\n\n\nMira turns as she begins to trot out of the tent, and you walk after her. You leave the tent, stepping past the unconscious guard.\n\n\n\"Pathetic. I thought he fell asleep on guard,\" Mira says. \"Instead, he accepted wine from a prisoner. Either way he was a weak fool who deserved to die.\"\n\n\n\"He doesn\u0027t need to die. He won\u0027t wake up for hours,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re as much as a coward as Whiskers. If he wakes up and alerts the guards, thank him. Now, let\u0027s go!\"\n\n\nYou continue following Mira through the camp, soon arriving at an opening among the tents under a tarp suspended by several poles. About two dozen humans are there, chained to large stakes in the ground. They\u0027re all asleep. A pair of centaurs lazily stand on guard, mostly fiddling with their swords.\n\n\n\"Play along,\" Mira says, grabbing your spear and tossing it on the ground a few feet away, before putting one of each of her two sword\u0027s to both you and Dikiz\u0027s throat. \n\n\nMira lets out a loud whistle, catching the pair\u0027s attention. The centaurs trot over, both quickly smacking their fist into their chests. They grunt in response, and the pair begin having a brief conversation. They talk briefly, before the two centaurs walk forward. One of them grabs you by the scruff of your neck, lifting you up to stare in your eye. The other slams the flat of her blade into Dikiz\u0027s head, grabbing her. They begin dragging you off back to your respective prisons, leaving Mira to the guard the prisoners. You wonder if she\u0027s turned you in, sacrificed you both to give her the chance to save Flynn. The centaur drags you close to your spear, within grabbing distance.\n",

The peasants have been paying enough tax to keep the ogres reasonably happy, so you’re happy. The peasants haven’t caused much issue, thankfully. Using the ogres as your enforcers to force the guards to continue their duty, little has actually changed. Sure, the amount of meat the peasants are eating has been reduced to nothing, although since you’re not sending off masses of wheat and such to the kin of humans, they’re actually left with more food. You’ve gathered up all the weapons other than simple bows for hunting and knives for crafting and cooking. You’ve had these weapons melted down to outfit your ogres with plated armor and massive war-hammers and great swords to create a terrifying fighting force.\n\n\nThe resistance has been light. No regiments of soldiers have arrived to attack, no mercenaries hired to harass you. Perhaps issues with Ratling clans and more frequent and larger raids by the Broken Tribes have weakened them. A few of your ogres, those with particularly large appetites, have asked if you’re going to push your advance to take more land and cement your position as overlord of the area.\n",

I showed him billions of those potential fates... he suffered through an eternity in just a few minutes fo your time. I\u0027m sure it broke his mind a bit, but after experiencing that, I imagine he\u0027d kill a million worlds to prevent anyone from suffering that fate, especially those he loved.\"\n\n\n\"So, that was the fate of everyone?\" you ask. \"To be trapped in a world like that?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no. That wasn\u0027t certain at all. It was just a possibility.\"\n\n\n\"How likely?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Oh, it\u0027s incredibly hard to calculate. I\u0027m not sure.\"\n\n\n\"So I don\u0027t even get to know the odds?!\" you yell.\n\n\nMol\u0027Chu shrugs, and you collapse to your knees in exasperation. \n\n\n\"So... it\u0027s over now?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Oh yes. Your story has come to an end. I\u0027ll be on my way out. Goodbye, Ritz,\" Mol\u0027Chu says, as the Tourist tips his hat.\n\n\n\"You played your part well.\"\n\n\nWith that, the two disappear, leaving you alone.

It\u0027s your breath,\" Dikiz says, clearly proud at having come up with a riddle you couldn\u0027t answer. \"Get it? Because when you run...\"\n\n\n\"I hate you so much,\" Mira says. \n\n\n\"I see the grove!\" Anna says, in one of her first interactions with the party outside of helping Redmond in his few spouts of waking consciousness and her attempts to get finger-fucked by Flynn.\n\n\nYou stare at the horizon, seeing the blurry outline of a massive row of green.\n\n\n\"What is it?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Pure, unending wilderness,\" she says.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s so green!\" Dikiz says. \"It\u0027s spectacular!

He should last the night, but I can\u0027t guarantee that.\"\n\n\nScampers continues to trot forward with little interest of the issues of the bipedal around him, and one particularly human like quadruped, as you sigh at the thought of having to venture into this massive forest. Gone is the structure of the real, man-created world of fields and towns, now there’s only the pure chaos of unrestrained wilderness.\n\n\nYou all pull into a field overgrown with weeds and with saplings breaking through the once-ploughed earth. It seems the grove is expanding into it. You quickly set up the tents, as Dikiz is dragged out of the carriage to try get the very last bit of sunlight he can soak up from the rapidly vanishing sun. You put a bundle of cloth under his head and set him up lying there, staring blankly up with eyes that aren’t really seeing.\n\n\n“What do we have to eat?” you ask, feeling your stomach growl like one of the direbears that prowl the forests.\n\n\n“We’re fairly low on food,” Anna say\n\n\n“We’re out. I mean, we have a few jobs of preserved vegetables and a few pieces of stale bread, but for the most part we’re out of food. If you want to actually eat anything worth eating, you best get scavenging or foraging or hunting or whatever.  \n\n\n“How low is ‘Fairly low’?” you ask. \n\n\n\"We have a bunch of preserved vegetables and stale bread, so unless you want to eat that, get going.\"\n\n\n\"Fine. Anyone want to go?\" you ask, looking around.\n\n\nRedmond is still dying slowly, Dikiz works to light a fire and Flynn and Anna almost immediately go back to flirting.

Why?\"\n\n\n\"Look at it! Ensnaring vines, close trees, no space. Fuck.\"\n\n\n\"Are you claustrophobic?\" you ask, grinning. \"What, the big bad centaur is scared?\"\n\n\n\"Fuck off. You grew up trapped in burrows. I grew up in open plains.\"\n\n\n\"Fine, I\u0027ll go alone,\" you sigh, climbing atop the giant rat and riding off into the forest. You enter in the forests, surrounded by massive trees blocking out most of the sunlight overhead. You hear birds chirping, the sound of rushing water from a nearby stream, the general sounds of nature filling your ears.\n\n\nFuck, it\u0027s unnerving. \n",
  "page 642": "You build up your forces and manage to build up defensive positions. Thankfully, it was the right move. Soon, the human armies begin attacking, just generally throwing themselves against the defenses. Centaur and Ratling mercenaries harass and ambush your forces. The regiments seem to be preparing to make a push to break through your lines.\n",
  "page 884": "You feel groggy, surrounded by darkness. Your legs have gone down to a dull ache, the only sensation you still feel. Suddenly, dull voices penetrate your mind.\n\n\n“This is my story! Mine! If he was to die at the foot of the mountain, then that was his fate!”\n\n\n“Oh, calm yourself, Crexiciliatanian. I only gave him a small help, gave the poor thing use of its legs and brought it to its allies. If anything, you should be thanking me.”\n\n\n“No more interference! You can\u0027t take a piece off the board and put it back two weeks later!  I let your previous actions slide, I even let him have his dealings with…” \n\n\nThe second voice made a noise that your senses couldn’t comprehend, a name so old and ancient your ears had never evolved to hear it, before the first hushed him down.\n\n\n“Alright, alright, no more interferences. I’ll let it unfold by itself from here on.”\n\n\nThe two voices stop, leaving you in total silence. After a few hours, you find the strength to fully awaken. You open your eyes, finding yourself staring at the bright blue of the sky. You slowly find the strength to stand, looking down at yourself. Your legs have fully healed, looking like they’d never been broken in the first place. You’re completely naked, although your fur naturally covers up at least most of that which clothes seek to hide from the world anyway. You find your sword impaled in the earth, pulling it free. You look around for anything else that could be of use, unfortunately finding nothing. Suddenly, you hear a voice.\n\n\n“I thought you said this route was safe!” a voice cries.\n\n\n“It was supposed to be!” another hisses. \"At least he isn\u0027t a Reaper.\"\n\n\nYou turn, finding yourself staring at a small trio of Raaz, holding bows and carrying a large golden statue. They stare at you, their mandibles clicking in a way you recognize shows pure terror.\n\n\n“Look… we don’t want any trouble. We don’t want to cause an issue. Just take everything we have and leave us live. Please.”\n\n\n“I’m… I need information. I was with a group and I lost them.”\n\n\n“We haven’t seen any Ratlings around here! Please, I don’t know where they are! Don’t kill us.”\n\n\n“Shut the fuck up, will you. My head is fucking aching. I’m not going to hurt you. The group wasn’t made up of Ratlings. There was a Centaur, an Ogre, a Raaz, like yourselves and a Nature Spirit.”\n\n\n“He’s hunting the key-bearer! Look, please, leave her be! She doesn’t have the key anymore! You need to let her live, I swear she doesn’t have it!”\n\n\n“I don’t want to hurt her! I was in her group!”\n\n\n“Prove it,” he says.\n\n\nYou swear, raising your sword.\n\n\n“I’ll cut you to ribbons if I don’t get answers. Her name was Dikiz, the centaur was Mira, the Nature Spirit was Tilly and the ogre was Orut. Now, are you going to give me what I want to know or am I going to smell what cooking Raaz smells like?”\n\n\n“Fine, fine! They’re at Stoneswell.”\n\n\n“What the fuck is Stoneswell and how far to it?” you ask.\n\n\n“It’s a nearby town. Only about an hour away.”\n\n\n“Can you take me there?” you ask.\n\n\n“We’re actually going in the opp…!” one of the Raaz begins to say, before another elbows him in the side.\n\n\n“Of course!” the second says. “It would be our pleasure.”\n\n\nYou nod.\n\n\n“Perfect. Thank you kindly,” you say. “Well? Lead on.”\n\n\nYou walk alongside the Raaz scavengers. You don’t try to make conversation, and neither do the scavengers. Soon, you reach the town, a small little place.\n\n\n\"Cheers,\" you say. \"I don\u0027t have anything to pay you for your...!\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s fine!\" one of the Raaz says. \"We\u0027ll be on our way.\"\n\n\n\"Alright. Thanks for your help,\" you say, walking towards the inn.\n\n\n\"Of course. Now, let\u0027s get the fuck out of here before Reapers show up,\" one of the Raaz says.\n\n\nYou pause, seeing your steeds outside. Scampers, Dinner and Khepri are outside, tied to the side of the inn. You walk over, rubbing Scampers neck and comforting him. Well, time to head into the inn.\n",
  "page 641": "Soon, you’re prepared to continue on the march again. Your host of ogres, armed with massive and powerful weapons and covered in seriously impressive armor. With each step forward in their march, the earth trembles. It should. You leave behind a few of your smarter, more disciplined soldiers to keep control of the territory you have. You head on, ready to slaughter.\n\n\nIt\u0027s at the Red Rock River you soon learn that the human army is like a sleeping giant. Slow to respond, yes, but brutal and all-powerful when it strikes back. You\u0027re chasing down the last of the town guard that resisted you when you see them. A tide of steel approaching, with red capes bearing the dragon that the weak human use to make themselves look strong. Still, their numbers...\n\n\nTwo regiments, both easily a match for your force in and of itself, have arrived. One comes down from the hills, spears and swords at the ready. The other marches along the plains, encompassing a wide space. It seems, quite frankly, that you\u0027re fucked.\n\n\n\"Boss! Orders?\" one of the ogres says, panicking.\n",
  "page 402": "You stand in the woods, leaning against a tree trunk as you look around. Towards the stream there should be some animal or another drinking. There\u0027s the sound of animals up ahead, presumably some herd of herbivores worth hunting. There\u0027s nests up above you that you could climb up to scavenge from. Finally, there\u0027s a lot of vegetables around that you could scavenge... but you really want meat.\n",
  "page 644": "You sit in the town hall, eagerly devouring a large leg of turkey, gnawing away at it. A trio of villagers stand in front of you, finishing their report. They discuss at length the weights their animals have grown. As a new lord you listen, although you don’t care. The peasants have been paying enough tax to keep the ogres reasonably happy, so you’re happy. The peasants haven’t caused much issue out of fear of the ogres. The peasants are little more than slaves, brutalized  You’ve gathered up all the weapons other than simple bows for hunting and knives for crafting and cooking. You’ve had these weapons melted down to outfit your ogres with plated armor and massive war-hammers and great swords to create a terrifying fighting force.\n\n\nThe resistance has been light. No regiments of soldiers have arrived to attack, no mercenaries hired to harass you. Perhaps issues with Ratling clans and more frequent and larger raids by the Broken Tribes have weakened them. A few of your ogres, those with particularly large appetites, have asked if you’re going to push your advance to take more land and cement your position as overlord of the area.\n",
  "page 886": "You walk into the inn, finding yourself in a small tavern. Orut lies on the ground, staring up at the ceiling, while Tilia sits next to his head. Dikiz\u0027s sit at the bar next to Mira.\n\n\nYou want to say something intelligent and witty, some grand statement that encompasses how you\u0027re still alive and so happy to see them, but Tilia almost instantly spots you. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s Ritz!\" Tilly says.\n\n\n\"Uh... yeah. Hi,\" you say.\n\n\nMira, Dikiz and Orut all turn to stare at you.\n\n\n\"Holy shit, he survived,\" Mira said.\n\n\n\"Ritz!

How long do you think it\u0027s been?\"\n\n\n\"A day? Two, maybe?\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s been two weeks,\" Mira says. \n\n\n\"What?\" Ritz asks. \"It can\u0027t have been two weeks. I only just... fuck, what did that eldritch prick do to me? What did I miss?\"\n\n\n\"Flynn and Redmond have been killing everyone.

While the Reapers deal with that, we target Mol\u0027Chu\u0027s cave,\" Mira says. \"Dikiz and Tilia have a spell to free Flynn and Redmond.\"\n\n\n\"How?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Mol\u0027Chu must\u0027ve possessed him, so we plan to get rid of that,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"I have a spell that should break the possession,\" Tilly says. \"We get in there, freeing Flynn, thus freeing Redmond, and then confront Mol\u0027Chu together.\"\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you say. \"What allies are there to talk to?\"\n\n\n\"Well... we\u0027re kind of lacking those. We could head to the center of the human empire\u0027s front and try beseech them for support,\" Dikiz says. \"We could also try venture out to the local Ratling clans, if you\u0027re willing. They\u0027ll be wiped out too, so they\u0027ll actually have some interest in helping us. Or... we could try our luck with the Raaz.

Please, I don’t know where they are! Don’t kill us.”\n\n\n“Shut the fuck up, will you. My head is fucking aching. I’m not going to hurt you. The group wasn’t made up of Ratlings. There was a Centaur, an Ogre, a Raaz, like yourselves and a Nature Spirit.”\n\n\n“He’s hunting the key-bearer! Look, please, leave her be! She doesn’t have the key anymore! You need to let her live, I swear she doesn’t have it!”\n\n\n“I don’t want to hurt her! I was in her group!”\n\n\n“Prove it,” he says.\n\n\nYou swear, raising your sword.\n\n\n“I’ll cut you to ribbons if I don’t get answers. Her name was Dikiz, the centaur was Mira, the Nature Spirit was Tilly and the ogre was Orut.

Thank you kindly,” you say. “Well? Lead on.”\n\n\nYou walk alongside the Raaz scavengers. You don’t try to make conversation, and neither do the scavengers.

Now, let\u0027s get the fuck out of here before Reapers show up,\" one of the Raaz says.\n\n\nYou pause, seeing your steeds outside.

From the axe at his side, you assume he was a logger venturing in here for a strong or rare wood to gather up for himself. He lies there, his intestines on the ground for a bad mauling.

I was looking forward to some wine,\" Flynn complains. \"Bastards would be hung, if I was in charge.\"\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s just eat,\" Redmond says.\n\n\nYou all quickly gather around the campfire as it begins to cook the venison. Flynn tells a grandiose tale of hunting down boars where he rode one for a solid mile before it got away, at which point Redmond bagged a deer and headed back. By then the meat is ready, and you quickly begin to feast, chowing down on a chunk of venison with glee. The sun sets, and with your bellies full and warm, you head to bed.\n",
  "page 465": "You creep into Mira\u0027s tent, pulling the flap open and stepping inside. Mra lies there, her upper body resting on her equine lower half.\n\n\n\"Mira? Are you awake?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"No. I\u0027m fast asleep,\" Mira replies, looking up at you. \"What?\" \n",
  "page 226": "\"I spy with my little eye...\" Dikiz begins once more, as you and Flynn groan in unison.\n\n\n\"I swear to fuck, if this is grass again, I\u0027ll be genuinely pissed,\" Flynn complains.\n\n\nSir Redmond lets out a sigh, long having giving up the idea of hushing you into silence.\n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t even finish it,\" Dikiz says. \"Trust me, you won\u0027t get this one!\"\n\n\nYou and Flynn both peer off into the endless plains of grass. You see the blurry shape of a merchant convoy on the horizon, pointing to it.\n\n\n\"Look, there actually is something new!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Thought we wouldn\u0027t see it, huh, Dikiz?\" Flynn says smugly. \"It\u0027s the merchant convoy!\"\n\n\n\"No. It was the grass,\" Dikiz says, before bursting into chittering laughter.\n\n\n\"Oh, fuck off!\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"We could do with a resupply,\" Redmond remarks.\n\n\n\"Seeing as two of us couldn\u0027t even get supplies,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Eat sand,\" Dikiz complains. \"I tried. Bastards wouldn\u0027t serve us.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, piss off, Chosen One,\" you say.\n\n\nFlynn laughs at both your annoyance.\n\n\n\"Cool it,\" Redmond says. \"Let\u0027s ride and meet up with them.\"\n\n\nYou all ride forward towards the merchant convoy, soon catching up. The merchants are all human, so you hope you don\u0027t have any trouble.\n\n\n\"Hello there!\" Sir Redmond cries. \"Can we purchase some goods from you?\"\n\n\n\"Certainly!\" the tanned merchant leader replies, as the carriages pull to the side. \"A Paladin, his squire, a Raaz and a Ratling. You keep interesting company. What brings you out here?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re out here searching for the writings of Steven the Mad. You don\u0027t know anything about where we could find it, do you?\"\n\n\nThe merchant flashes a pearly white, wide grin as you all dismount from your steeds. \n\n\n\"You are a lucky man, Paladin! You\u0027ve found the Crown in the shit stack, I\u0027ll tell you that!\"\n\n\n\"Do you know something?\" Redmond asks, surprised. \n\n\n\"Know something! Ha! My friend, I have something! Come inside my caravan!\"\n\n\nThe merchant leader quickly leads the lot of you into the caravan, which is stacked with goods. You pause, seeing a large piece of some type of brown parchment hanging from the wall, with small, raised writing on it.\n\n\n\"Is that it?\" you ask.\n\n\nPaladin Redmond grins.\n\n\n\"Yes, that\u0027s it. It lines up with what few fragments of his writing I\u0027ve acquired.\"\n\n\n\"I thought there\u0027d be more,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"There is. But this is the passage we need. How much?\"\n\n\n\"50\u0027000 Crowns,\" the merchant leader says.\n\n\nRedmond grimaces, before nodding.\n\n\n\"I have several diamonds of immense value. Will a trade do?\"\n\n\n\"Of course. I have a jeweler among m...!\"\n\n\n\"Attack! Attack!\" someone screams.\n\n\nYou all quickly race outside, and you freeze in your tracks. A black blur is on the horizon. You narrow your eyes, making out hundreds of horses charging towards you. \n\n\n\"Fucking hell,\" Redmond say, his mouth hanging open. \"That\u0027s a whole tribe. An entire fucking one of the Broken Tribes. Why the hell are they all here?\"\n\n\n\"I... may have offended one of them,\" the merchant leader grins.\n\n\n\"What the fuck do we do?\" Flynn says.\n",
  "page 468": "\"I  was... uh... thinking about our conversation earlier.\"\n\n\n\"What?\" Mira asks, rubbing sleep from her eyes.\n\n\n\"You know, the thing... that we discussed.\"\n\n\n\"I swear to God, I\u0027m going to behead you if you don\u0027t tell me what the fuck you\u0027re talking about.\"\n\n\n\"I mean the thing we talked about earlier! About you being attractive and so I wanted to spend some time with you!\" you say. \n\n\n\"Oh?\" Mira says. \"You\u0027re asking to fuck.\"\n\n\nYou pause, before nodding your head. \n\n\n\"Oh, terrific. I was considering wandering into the woods and finding a wild stallion to mount me.\"\n\n\nYou nod, staring down at her body. Her large breasts look particularly appetizing. Her body is lined with the crimson tattoos that outline every curve making it look even more...\n\n\n\"Holy shit, did I break you?\" Mira asks, laughing. \"Close your mouth for death\u0027s sake and get to it.\"\n\n\nMira stands, moving around to present herself to you, bending over to allow you view of her nether regions.\n\n\n\"It looks very... horse-like,\" you say, feeling both disgust and lust. More lust than disgust, though. In fact, it\u0027s pretty much entirely lust.\n\n\n\"Do you want to leave?\" Mira asks, annoyed you\u0027re taking so long.\n\n\nWith your hormones taking over, you shake your head. You half cling, half-clamber onto her backside and gently push your member in with a sigh of relief. Pleasure floods into your body as you begin to thrust.\n",
  "page 467": "\"The ratling\u0027s in there,\" a voice says.\n\n\n\"Get him out here.\"\n\n\nYou awaken with a groan, rubbing your eyes as you struggle to sit up. Suddenly the tent flap opens as a pair of ratlings barge in. You go to draw your sword, before another punches you in the side of the head and you fall back as the other slams a mace into your stomach as you yell. They grab your arms, dragging you out in front of the camp fire. Dikiz and Anna kneelsthere bound with rope, with Flynn getting punched repeatedly in the head as he tries to resist, before being forced to his knees and having his hands bound behind his back. \n\n\n\"Where\u0027s the centaur?\" one of the ratlings asks.\n\n\n\"Die!\" you hear Mira shout, as she explodes out of her tents, a ratling who has had one of her swords run through him. \n\n\nA dozen of the ratlings charge her, as she swings her blades, beheading two before rearing up and kicking in the head of another. The ratlings jump on top of her, grabbing her arms and dragging her to the ground, where one of the larger brutes collapses on her, holding her arms down as other ratlings bind her with chains.\n\n\nOne of the larger rats, a angry little creature covered in scarred flesh where tufts of fur are missing with his arm replaced with a long blade. He walks around the campfire, snarling. They drag an unconscious Redmond out, tossing him into the center of the room.\n\n\n\"Fuck. How many did the centaur kill?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"Five,\" one of the other ratlings answers.\n\n\n\"Fuckity fuck,\" the leader sighs. \"Alright, let\u0027s get the captives sorted out. We bring the ratling back with us. The centaur, have your way with and slit her throat. Keep the Raaz, they pay a good ransom for their people. The humans... have your way with the woman, then we\u0027ll find a town to sell them off.\"\n\n\nYou pause, seeing your shadow from the campfire. The shadow is bound as you are, but slips his hand free to raise it up to wave at you.\n\n\n\"One of them\u0027s an alchemist,\" a ratling says. \"Could use one of those.\"\n\n\nYou will the shadow your orders as it nods eagerly. The shadow stretches along the ground, grabbing the shadow of a blade stabbed into the ground. The blade rises from the air as it twirls around in the air. \n",

Soon, you make out what they are. Although there\u0027s a few humans atop horses, the vast majority of them seem to be half-horse, half-men, the infamous Centaurs that made the Broken Tribes so powerful back in the day.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t refer to them as the Broken Tribes,\" Redmond says.\n\n\n\"Why?\" Dikiz asks.\n\n\n\"The Broken Tribes were once united as the Great Tribe under the leader Great Chieftain Tai until his death, when they shattered back to individual tribes, each of whom\u0027s chieftain wanted to become Grand Chieftain. Each tribe now claims to be the Great Tribe led by the true Great Chieftain. Hush now, they\u0027re here.\"\n\n\nYou see the Centaurs more clearly now. They\u0027re tanned creatures with flowing long hair with blades and axes clutched in their hands. One of the largest, a massive, muscled beast covered in scars with the lower quarters of a black stallion strolls forward, a massive sword that\u0027s as long as you are tall. He slows down as the others surround you.\n\n\n\"Denir!\" he roars.\n\n\nThe merchant leader smiles nervously, stepping forward. \n\n\n\"Great Chieftain Kildari!\" the merchant leader says.\n\n\nWith lightning speed, the centaur swings the blade, beheading the merchant leader with ease. The merchant leader collapses to the ground. He stares over the merchant caravan, looking at you. He barks out an order in a foreign tongue, before another centaur, this time a female, rides forward. Strangely, her entire body is tattooed with strange runes, the language of the centaurs. Whilst you try to continue staring at her face to avoid a slow and painful death, your eyes do drop to her bouncing tits. It seems clothes aren\u0027t popular among the centaurs.\n\n\nThe two centaurs have a brief conversation, before the Chieftain barks out an order, and a chained human is dragged from the back of a horse and forced to kneel in front of him, before saying something to the man, who nods, clearly terrified.\n\n\n\"Kneel,\" the man says, staring at you. \"You better kneel.\"\n",

A massive mammoth skull hangs from the wall, it\u0027s huge tusks hanging there. There’s a large bed of huddled furs from massive creatures more adopted to the freezing col than you are. Skinned corpses of rams, horses and more humanoid things hang in the corner in front of an open fireplace with a spit above it. You walk over to the bed, collapsing down in it with a sigh of relief, putting your head on the pelt of a direwolf’s fur, bundled into a pillow. At least you’ll sleep well here before you’re eaten. There’s also a large throne made from wood, laden with skulls. Fancy.\n\n\nAn ogre appears in the doorway, skulls hanging from her neck, otherwise completely naked. From her tits and genitalia you can tell she’s human, although her face doesn’t betray the fact.\n\n\n“You’re the chieftain!” she grunts.\n\n\n“Is that a question?” you ask.\n\n\n“You’re the chieftain!,” she grunts again in the same tone.\n\n\n“Yes,” you nod.\n\n\n“I am Tuk, first wife of Orut Skull-Taker.”\n\n\n“Ah,” you say, nodding. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions as to where your hus…”\n\n\n“He’s gone,” the ogre says. “You’re chieftain now.”\n\n\n“Yes,” you nod again, wondering if she has any idea what the fuck is even going on.\n\n\n“You’re new chieftain,” the ogre says again, staring at you.\n\n\nThe ogre pauses, waiting in confusion. You both stare blankly at each other for about a minute, before you finally decide to speak again.\n\n\n“What do you want?” you ask.\n\n\n“You’re new chieftain,” she says again, as if saying it one more time will get her message through to you.\n\n\n“Is there something the chieftain should be doing right now?” you ask.\n\n\nLacking the vocabulary to get her point across, the ogre makes a thrusting motion an you wince as her crotch moves with the strength and speed to crush granite.\n\n\nWell, it seems wives transfer over to the new chieftain. \n",

You walk over, quickly readying Scampers for the ride out of the city. Oak gives a few annoyed neighs as your hands touch it, but you manage to saddle it with only the slightest bit of difficulty, although it does give you a kick in the leg, seeming to somehow know how hard to kick you to avoid injuring you too badly, while still hurting you. What a goddamn prick of a horse. You walk to Silver, who\u0027s not even slightly willing to let you touch her. You gently approach, chiding it, but it kicks and bucks as soon as you get anywhere near it. You wait, before stepping forward to grab it, tightening the saddle and staying at its side so it can\u0027t kick in your skull. You manage to get it at least half-ready while avoiding any serious and no doubt crippling kicks by the time Flynn and Redmond appear again.\n\n\n\"Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

  "page 122": "\"Fine, stay then. The Prophecy is simple. We need the the blood of a Titan. A spirit of nature. The Ancient Key of the Ninth Beetle. The writings of Stephen the Mad. Getting the Titan blood will be an issue. Now, the Titans are long extinct, killed in the great Titanic War where they were overthrown from their positions as physical gods by Man, Raaz, Centaur, Reptillian, Ratling, Nature Spirits, the whole fucking shebang. Hell, even the Ghost Kings were there that day. We took the Titans\u0027 thrones over us and regained our freedom, but they weren\u0027t driven extinct. No, they survived as beasts. They were driven to the mountains, where they ended up breeding with the mortal Giants that lay there. They ended up not only breeding with them, but inbreeding. Inbreeding and fucking giants eventually left them as what they are today.\"\n\n\n\"The Titans are extinct today. So are the Giants.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, they merged into a horrible subspecies with all the faults and none of the benefits. The Ogres. A horrible species of walking, thinking mouths. Fuck, that\u0027s not even true. They don\u0027t think. Still, they have Titan blood in them. Their chieftains even more so. We need to find one of their chieftains, and recruit them.\"\n\n\n\"OK, recruit an Ogre Chieftain. It\u0027s hard, but if we stuff enough cows down its throat, we\u0027ll be fine,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"A nature spirit. They held keep nature intact or whatever nonsense. I\u0027ve never trusted them personally. Anyhow, we need to recruit one of them, as well.\"\n\n\n\"OK, they tend to be trouble, complaining about every single bit of wood chopped down, but we can deal with them. What else?\" Flynn asks. \n\n\n\"The Ancient Key of the Ninth Beetle. The Ancient Raaz Prophet forged nine keys, eight of which were used at various prophetic times such as sealing off the magic gateway created by the infamous Sigmund the Black, or closing the mountain path itself through cave ins to crush the Titan army. Only the ninth has gone unused. The nomadic Raaz that populate the desert hold this key as sacred, and understandably so. We need to retrieve it.\"\n\n\n\"Now that is going to be hard. They\u0027ll never give us that key.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that\u0027s going to be a hard one. That\u0027s why we\u0027re going to get it next.\" \n\n\n\"Is that everything, then?\"\n\n\n\"One last thing. We need the writings of Stephen the Mad.\"\n\n\n\"Where are they?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"See, that\u0027s the problem. Giving his name, I\u0027m sure you can guess Stephen\u0027s fate. He went mad at the height of his writing career, dreadfully so. Then, he wrote the an ancient, huge ballad known as the Scéal. Most of it was nonsense, mind you, but one part was noticeable as being somewhat sane. He said, in what might\u0027ve been his only sane moment, that this was the code to a door. It\u0027s necessary as part of the prophecy to get this code.\"\n\n\n\"Well, where is it?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"I have no idea, admittedly. It\u0027s said he burnt all copies but one, took it off with him and joined the Broken Tribes. So that\u0027s where I plan on visiting to track it down.\"\n\n\n\"So recruit an angry Ogre, recruit a nature spirit who most likely hates not only us, but the civilization we\u0027re a part of, steal a key from the Raaz, who may I remind you have armies of massive Sand Worms, and then we track down a piece of writing that could easily be long gone, all in the company of a Ratling who\u0027ll most likely slit our throats while we sleep?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Well then. Terrific,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Redmond sighs. \"But it\u0027s necessary.

  "page 128": "You begin cooking your meal in silence, watching as the water boils, chucking pieces of meat and what few vegetables you have into the pot. You stir it slowly, cooking your stew. After about an hour, maybe a little more, during which Flynn only bitches and complains, before finally falling asleep, at which point Redmond arrives back, a deer slung over his shoulders.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s eat,\" he says, hanging it over the back of his steed.\n",

Your fate, however, is less certain.\"\n\n\nThe man\u0027s blade illuminates, casting golden light on the both of you. You stare at his grizzled face with a thick beard growing. He slips a green vial from his satchel, shoving it in front of you.\n\n\n\"Drink it,\" he commands. \n\n\nYou uncork the bottle, and press the bottle to your lips. You quickly raise it up and gulp down the foul-tasting liquid, trying not to puke. You finish it, handing the bottle back.\n\n\n\"That is Ivy\u0027s Tongue.

You make your way out into the ruins and begin waiting, rubbing your neck as you feel the poison course through it.\n\n\nIt\u0027s not long before the screaming starts. You hear horrified screams from the Ratlings. Soon, the glow of fire begins to surface from the burrows. The man is burning the others alive. You stare down in fear, but not sadness. You didn\u0027t have anything particular in there. Family, technically, but your mother was a barely sentient massive rat only good for the womb and cunt she had, your brothers would\u0027ve gleefully slit your throat to make a cloak out of your skin, and your father was some Ratling Warrior killed in the invasion of either the groves of the Free Spirits or the Broken Tribes. No, your true emotion is fear at what the man powerful enough to wipe out an entire burrow could do to you.\n\n\nIt\u0027s not long before the man from earlier appears, walking out of the firestorm that fills the burrow. You know see him in full light, wearing ornate plate armor with a sapphire dragon on the front. In his left hand is a glowing fireball, in his right a long dagger. He looks at you, his eyes filled with sadness.\n\n\n\"What happened her?\" he asks quietly, staring at you.\n\n\nYou know you need to choose your words carefully. The fires that ravage your burrow is nothing compared to the fires behind his eyes. \n\n\n\"She was... taken,\" you say. \"They raided her merchant caravan.\"\n\n\n\"They? They?! They\u0027re not the ones who have her necklace. You do!\" the man shouts.\n\n\n\"I was there. I was ordered to escort her back to the camp. I took her,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You knew! You fucking knew what they did to victims there, didn\u0027t you?\"\n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t have a choice. I swear.

The guards all raise their spears, as Redmond sighs.\n\n\n\"If one of you could tell me where the fuck I am and what\u0027s going on, I would appreciate it,\" Redmond rasps.\n\n\nThe Captain lowers his spear, raising his hands.\n\n\n\"Look, Sir Paladin, we have no issue with you! We were only investigating if you had been attacked and kidnapped by this group.\"\n\n\nSir Redmond releases the guard, who stumbles forward out of his grasp.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re with me. As a paladin, I...!\" Redmond says, before passing and collapsing off his horse. \n\n\n\"He needs a doctor!\" you say frantically.\n\n\n\"We have a traveling alchemist passing through town. Cheung, Faust, get the paladin.\"\n\n\nTwo guards rush forward, grabbing Redmond and lifting him into the air. They carry him off, and Scampers scampers after them. You move quickly through the town to a caravan at the edge of town. You climb over Scampers and follow Redmond as he\u0027s dragged inside.\n\n\n\"How the fuck do I go in there?\" Mira complains loudly.\n\n\n\"Wait outside!\" Dikiz says as she rushes inside. \n\n\nInside, a young woman mixes potions, turning around. You pause, staring at her. She\u0027s very beautiful, with pale skin and long, ebony black hair. Her eyes and wide and shockingly blue.\n\n\n\"Ah look, a new patient,\" she says.\n\n\nShe grabs a pair of gloves, slipping them on and walks forward, grabbing Redmond and leading him to a seat.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s the ailment?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s been poisoned with Manasa Grass Oil,\" you say.\n\n\nYou watch as the alchemist begins searching through her potions and what she has at her disposal, frowning. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s... I\u0027ll be honest, it\u0027s not optimistic.\"\n\n\nShe grabs a book, flicking through it before stopping on a page, frowning.\n\n\n\"Ah... it appears I don\u0027t have what\u0027s needed to help him.\"\n\n\n\"Where do we get it?\" the captain asks.\n\n\n\"Deep within the grove. At least a day\u0027s journey into it.\"\n\n\n\"How far are we from the grove?\"\n\n\n\"At least a day,\" the Captain says.\n\n\n\"Hmm... we\u0027ll last about two, maybe three days.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll send a rider to gather what you need,\" the Captain says.\n\n\n\"No, it\u0027ll be a two day journey either way. He won\u0027t last that. You\u0027d need to take him with you and make the potion there.\"\n\n\n\"What can we do?\" Flynn asks. \"Can you help us?\"\n\n\nFlynn stares into the Alchemist\u0027s eyes as they go quiet.\n\n\n\"Hey Flynn, remember that old guy who mentored us? Reddington or something? Yeah, he\u0027s dying in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"I could come with you to the grove to make the potion,\" the Alchemist says. \"I\u0027m due a trip there to refresh my stock. It would take about three days with the carriage, but we could make it.\"\n\n\n\"Dikiz, Ritz, go restock on supplies,\" Flynn says, pulling a satchel of golden coins from his satchel and handing it to you. \"I\u0027ll deal with the alchemist.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s Anna,\" the alchemist says. \"Take guards with you so the shopkeepers serve you.\n\n\n\"Um... OK,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go,\" you say, walking outside.\n\n\nYou head alongside Dikiz, Mira and the Captain as the town guards disperse to continue their regular duties, towards the general store.\n\n\n\"So what did they say?\" Mira asks. \"Are we slitting his throat?\"\n\n\n\"No! Hell, take it easy!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"We need to head to the Grove to get the herbs and ingredients ready to cure him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh for fuck\u0027s sake! We don\u0027t need a detour! Hang on, don\u0027t we need a nature spirit for the plan?\"\n\n\n\"We do,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, maybe this won\u0027t be a waste of time. We head to the grove, kidnap a nature spirit, find whatever herbs, maybe bury the paladin, then head off towards the mountains for that Titan blood.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re right,\" you say. \"Hey, Dikiz? I have a question about social shit.\"\n\n\n\"Not my specialty, but fire,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Do you think there was anything going on between that Alchemist and Flynn?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean \"going on\"? Like, they almost started mating in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"Oh great. So we basically just got a random fuck buddy for Flynn.\"\n\n\n\"Jealous?\" Mira laughs.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go shopping,\" you say.\n\n\nYou resupply on everything you need, and soon arrive back at the caravan, where Flynn and Anna are talking.\n\n\n\"Anna is going to accompany us on our quest in exchange for a note of pardons from Paladin Redmond to allow her to import certain illegal potions and herbs,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Great,\" you say. \"So the party\u0027s growing by one.\"\n\n\n\"We need to go,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We do,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get riding then,\" Mira says. \n\n\nYou turn to the Captain, who stares at you.\n\n\n\"Thanks for your help,\" you say.\n\n\n\"My pleasure, ratling. You\u0027re a credit to your species. As are your centaur and Raaz friend.\"\n\n\n\"Hurry the fuck up, shit for brains!\" Mira yells, as the carriage begins to pull away. \n\n\n\"Maybe just teh Raaz and you,\" the Captain says.\n",

A massive mammoth skull hangs from the wall, it\u0027s huge tusks hanging there. There’s a large bed of huddled furs from massive creatures more adopted to the freezing col than you are. Skinned corpses of rams, horses and more humanoid things hang in the corner in front of an open fireplace with a spit above it. You walk over to the bed, collapsing down in it with a sigh of relief, putting your head on the pelt of a direwolf’s fur, bundled into a pillow. At least you’ll sleep well here before you’re eaten. There’s also a large throne made from wood, laden with skulls. Fancy.\n\n\nAn ogre appears in the doorway, skulls hanging from her neck, otherwise completely naked. From her tits and genitalia you can tell she’s human, although her face doesn’t betray the fact.\n\n\n“You’re the chieftain!” she grunts.\n\n\n“Is that a question?” you ask.\n\n\n“You’re the chieftain!,” she grunts again in the same tone.\n\n\n“Yes,” you nod.\n\n\n“I am Tuk, first wife of Orut Skull-Taker.”\n\n\n“Ah,” you say, nodding. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions as to where your hus…”\n\n\n“He’s gone,” the ogre says. “You’re chieftain now.”\n\n\n“Yes,” you nod again, wondering if she has any idea what the fuck is even going on.\n\n\n“You’re new chieftain,” the ogre says again, staring at you.\n\n\nThe ogre pauses, waiting in confusion. You both stare blankly at each other for about a minute, before you finally decide to speak again.\n\n\n“What do you want?” you ask.\n\n\n“You’re new chieftain,” she says again, as if saying it one more time will get her message through to you.\n\n\n“Is there something the chieftain should be doing right now?” you ask.\n\n\nLacking the vocabulary to get her point across, the ogre makes a thrusting motion an you wince as her crotch moves with the strength and speed to crush granite.\n\n\nWell, it seems wives transfer over to the new chieftain. \n",

It\u0027s only after a few minutes of waiting and sipping that Redmond arrives with a new man in tow.\n\n\nThe man, or boy, more accurately, seems to be in his last teens, given the weak few hairs that attempt to make up a beard despite lacking in numbers.

Cheung, Faust, get the paladin.\"\n\n\nTwo guards rush forward, grabbing Redmond and lifting him into the air. They carry him off, and Scampers scampers after them.

You climb over Scampers and follow Redmond as he\u0027s dragged inside.\n\n\n\"How the fuck do I go in there?\" Mira complains loudly.\n\n\n\"Wait outside!\" Dikiz says as she rushes inside. \n\n\nInside, a young woman mixes potions, turning around.

Reddington or something? Yeah, he\u0027s dying in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"I could come with you to the grove to make the potion,\" the Alchemist says. \"I\u0027m due a trip there to refresh my stock. It would take about three days with the carriage, but we could make it.\"\n\n\n\"Dikiz, Ritz, go restock on supplies,\" Flynn says, pulling a satchel of golden coins from his satchel and handing it to you. \"I\u0027ll deal with the alchemist.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s Anna,\" the alchemist says. \"Take guards with you so the shopkeepers serve you.\n\n\n\"Um...

Hell, take it easy!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"We need to head to the Grove to get the herbs and ingredients ready to cure him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh for fuck\u0027s sake! We don\u0027t need a detour! Hang on, don\u0027t we need a nature spirit for the plan?\"\n\n\n\"We do,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, maybe this won\u0027t be a waste of time. We head to the grove, kidnap a nature spirit, find whatever herbs, maybe bury the paladin, then head off towards the mountains for that Titan blood.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re right,\" you say. \"Hey, Dikiz? I have a question about social shit.\"\n\n\n\"Not my specialty, but fire,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Do you think there was anything going on between that Alchemist and Flynn?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean \"going on\"? Like, they almost started mating in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"Oh great. So we basically just got a random fuck buddy for Flynn.\"\n\n\n\"Jealous?\" Mira laughs.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go shopping,\" you say.\n\n\nYou resupply on everything you need, and soon arrive back at the caravan, where Flynn and Anna are talking.\n\n\n\"Anna is going to accompany us on our quest in exchange for a note of pardons from Paladin Redmond to allow her to import certain illegal potions and herbs,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Great,\" you say. \"So the party\u0027s growing by one.\"\n\n\n\"We need to go,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We do,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get riding then,\" Mira says. \n\n\nYou turn to the Captain, who stares at you.\n\n\n\"Thanks for your help,\" you say.\n\n\n\"My pleasure, ratling. You\u0027re a credit to your species.

  "page 86": "\"She trusted you? She was always too trusting. Always too loving,\" the man says.\n\n\nThe man stares at you. He pauses, staring at the burning fires. He makes a grunting noise, and you realize he\u0027s started to cry. He stops himself, taking in a deep breath and beginning to chant under his breath. \n\n\n\"I have the soul of the dragon. Dragons to not break. Dragons do not die. Dragons do not show fear. Dragons survive the flames. I have the soul of the dragon...\" he chants.\n\n\nHe continues his chant for about a minute, before stopping, taking a deep breath.\n\n\n\"How do you bury your dead, rat?\"\n\n\n\"We... uh, eat them,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We bury them. I buried my wife. But my daughter was above the earth\u0027s grasp. Burning is...\" he says, before taking a deep breath. \"It... it\u0027s a pure way, isn\u0027t it?\"\n\n\nYou stay silent, as he stares at the fire.\n\n\n\"She nearly died when she was seven. Got found by an Ogre, rather than running, she tried to talk to him. She always did see the best in things. I managed to save her then. I couldn\u0027t now.\"\n\n\nHe continues staring into the burning fire, no longer talking to you, now talking to himself.\n\n\n\"She loved all creatures. Such a loving girl. Saw the best in things. Saw something in you. Perhaps you can serve a purpose after all. Perhaps you don\u0027t have to grow up like the rats and the filth you were raised by. My squire, Hemsworth, took an arrow to the neck in the battle with the Centaurs. Do you know what a squire is?\"\n\n\nYou pause, thinking.\n\n\n\"Isn\u0027t it a big tower?\"\n\n\n\"No,\" the man say, wiping tears from his face. \"It\u0027s a knight\u0027s assistant. If you\u0027re willing, you\u0027ll fulfill the same role. You don\u0027t have many other options, do you?\"\n\n\nYou reflect on this. Without a burrow, you have nothing. By yourself you\u0027re not strong enough to raid. You have no treasure to spend, animals to raise or land to farm. No other burrows would accept you, forcing you to live on the top layer like scum, barely surviving. Any city or town you found would have you killed on sight. You don\u0027t have many options here.\n\n\n\"No, I don\u0027t,\" you admit.\n\n\n\"Can you cook?\" he asks.\n\n\n\"I can. The real question is whether you can stomach it,\" you say, trying to infuse some layer of humor into the conversation, because he\u0027s unnerving you.\n\n\n\"Funny,\" the man says, although his tone makes it clear he doesn\u0027t give a shit for your attempts at humor. \"I\u0027m sure you can learn. Your kind take to violence well, don\u0027t you? You can use a sword?\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Good, you\u0027ll need to. I\u0027m on a quest. I could use an assistant. Are you up for it?\"\n\n\nYou pause, thinking, but realistically, you don\u0027t have a choice here.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m in,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Fine. You\u0027ll need a steed.\"\n\n\n\"We don\u0027t ride horses,\" you say. \"They don\u0027t like our kind.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve heard. They don\u0027t like your kind, understandably so. Your kind seem to ride giant rats, do they not?\"\n\n\n\"We do.\"\n\n\n\"Fetch one, then.\"\n\n\n\"I... I\u0027m dying. The poison,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Ah, yes. Almost forgot,\" the man says, drawing a vial of colorless liquid from his satchel and throwing it to you. \"Catch it.\"\n\n\nYou catch it, quickly uncorking it and drinking it down as you feel the pain in your veins subsides. You relax, breathing out a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\"Well then... go, fetch a giant rat,\" he says. \"You\u0027ll need a ride.\"\n\n\n\"You don\u0027t just fetch a rat. All the tame ones have owners.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, feel free to waltz back home and find those owners,\" the man says.\n\n\nYou look at the dozens of little ones, simple, normal rats scurrying out of the burring burrows, and realize a few giant ones will no doubt have escaped the fires.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s your name?\" you ask, pausing.\n\n\n\"Sir Redmond. You?\"\n\n\n\"Ritz,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Terrific. Now, go find your steed so we can get out of here.\"\n\n\nYou nod, turning and walking away. There\u0027s a few places you could venture to find a Giant Rat. If the burrows were burnt up, they\u0027d head to the river to cool off their burns.\n\n\nIt\u0027s a short scamper to the river. Eventually, you reach it. Several massive, horse-sized black rats drink from the water. You move towards them, but they snarl at you, and you quickly backpedal. You stare up the river, finding a smaller one drinking by itself. You slowly edge forward. It stops, staring at you.\n\n\n\"Hey there, buddy,\" you say quietly.\n",

The guards all raise their spears, as Redmond sighs.\n\n\n\"If one of you could tell me where the fuck I am and what\u0027s going on, I would appreciate it,\" Redmond rasps.\n\n\nThe Captain lowers his spear, raising his hands.\n\n\n\"Look, Sir Paladin, we have no issue with you! We were only investigating if you had been attacked and kidnapped by this group.\"\n\n\nSir Redmond releases the guard, who stumbles forward out of his grasp.\n\n\n\"They\u0027re with me.

Cheung, Faust, get the paladin.\"\n\n\nTwo guards rush forward, grabbing Redmond and lifting him into the air. They carry him off, and Scampers scampers after them. You move quickly through the town to a caravan at the edge of town. You climb over Scampers and follow Redmond as he\u0027s dragged inside.\n\n\n\"How the fuck do I go in there?\" Mira complains loudly.\n\n\n\"Wait outside!\" Dikiz says as she rushes inside. \n\n\nInside, a young woman mixes potions, turning around. You pause, staring at her. She\u0027s very beautiful, with pale skin and long, ebony black hair. Her eyes and wide and shockingly blue.\n\n\n\"Ah look, a new patient,\" she says.\n\n\nShe grabs a pair of gloves, slipping them on and walks forward, grabbing Redmond and leading him to a seat.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s the ailment?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s been poisoned with Manasa Grass Oil,\" you say.\n\n\nYou watch as the alchemist begins searching through her potions and what she has at her disposal, frowning. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s... I\u0027ll be honest, it\u0027s not optimistic.\"\n\n\nShe grabs a book, flicking through it before stopping on a page, frowning.\n\n\n\"Ah... it appears I don\u0027t have what\u0027s needed to help him.\"\n\n\n\"Where do we get it?\" the captain asks.\n\n\n\"Deep within the grove.

He won\u0027t last that. You\u0027d need to take him with you and make the potion there.\"\n\n\n\"What can we do?\" Flynn asks. \"Can you help us?\"\n\n\nFlynn stares into the Alchemist\u0027s eyes as they go quiet.\n\n\n\"Hey Flynn, remember that old guy who mentored us? Reddington or something? Yeah, he\u0027s dying in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"I could come with you to the grove to make the potion,\" the Alchemist says. \"I\u0027m due a trip there to refresh my stock. It would take about three days with the carriage, but we could make it.\"\n\n\n\"Dikiz, Ritz, go restock on supplies,\" Flynn says, pulling a satchel of golden coins from his satchel and handing it to you. \"I\u0027ll deal with the alchemist.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s Anna,\" the alchemist says. \"Take guards with you so the shopkeepers serve you.\n\n\n\"Um...

We head to the grove, kidnap a nature spirit, find whatever herbs, maybe bury the paladin, then head off towards the mountains for that Titan blood.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re right,\" you say. \"Hey, Dikiz? I have a question about social shit.\"\n\n\n\"Not my specialty, but fire,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Do you think there was anything going on between that Alchemist and Flynn?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean \"going on\"?

  "page 121": "You walk outside, where two horses stand. Oak stands next to Scampers, whilst Flynn\u0027s steed, Silver, stands nervously away from Scampers. You walk over, quickly readying Scampers for the ride out of the city. Oak gives a few annoyed neighs as your hands touch it, but you manage to saddle it with only the slightest bit of difficulty, although it does give you a kick in the leg, seeming to somehow know how hard to kick you to avoid injuring you too badly, while still hurting you. What a goddamn prick of a horse. You walk to Silver, who\u0027s not even slightly willing to let you touch her. You gently approach, chiding it, but it kicks and bucks as soon as you get anywhere near it. You wait, before stepping forward to grab it, tightening the saddle and staying at its side so it can\u0027t kick in your skull. You manage to get it at least half-ready while avoiding any serious and no doubt crippling kicks by the time Flynn and Redmond appear again.\n\n\n\"Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

He won\u0027t last that. You\u0027d need to take him with you and make the potion there.\"\n\n\n\"What can we do?\" Flynn asks. \"Can you help us?\"\n\n\nFlynn stares into the Alchemist\u0027s eyes as they go quiet.\n\n\n\"Hey Flynn, remember that old guy who mentored us? Reddington or something? Yeah, he\u0027s dying in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"I could come with you to the grove to make the potion,\" the Alchemist says. \"I\u0027m due a trip there to refresh my stock.

OK,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go,\" you say, walking outside.\n\n\nYou head alongside Dikiz, Mira and the Captain as the town guards disperse to continue their regular duties, towards the general store.\n\n\n\"So what did they say?\" Mira asks. \"Are we slitting his throat?\"\n\n\n\"No! Hell, take it easy!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"We need to head to the Grove to get the herbs and ingredients ready to cure him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh for fuck\u0027s sake! We don\u0027t need a detour! Hang on, don\u0027t we need a nature spirit for the plan?\"\n\n\n\"We do,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, maybe this won\u0027t be a waste of time. We head to the grove, kidnap a nature spirit, find whatever herbs, maybe bury the paladin, then head off towards the mountains for that Titan blood.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re right,\" you say. \"Hey, Dikiz? I have a question about social shit.\"\n\n\n\"Not my specialty, but fire,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Do you think there was anything going on between that Alchemist and Flynn?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean \"going on\"? Like, they almost started mating in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"Oh great. So we basically just got a random fuck buddy for Flynn.\"\n\n\n\"Jealous?\" Mira laughs.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go shopping,\" you say.\n\n\nYou resupply on everything you need, and soon arrive back at the caravan, where Flynn and Anna are talking.\n\n\n\"Anna is going to accompany us on our quest in exchange for a note of pardons from Paladin Redmond to allow her to import certain illegal potions and herbs,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Great,\" you say. \"So the party\u0027s growing by one.\"\n\n\n\"We need to go,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We do,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get riding then,\" Mira says. \n\n\nYou turn to the Captain, who stares at you.\n\n\n\"Thanks for your help,\" you say.\n\n\n\"My pleasure, ratling. You\u0027re a credit to your species. As are your centaur and Raaz friend.\"\n\n\n\"Hurry the fuck up, shit for brains!\" Mira yells, as the carriage begins to pull away. \n\n\n\"Maybe just teh Raaz and you,\" the Captain says.\n",
  "page 391": "\"I guess not, to be honest,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, perfect,\" Dikiz says. \"That\u0027s smart. The Raaz aren\u0027t the romantic types. A few arranged breeding rounds, but not much in terms of romance. I\u0027ve heard warrior squads.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve never seen Raaz Warriors fight. They do have the natural armor thing going for them.\"\n\n\n\"Hey, we\u0027re all permanently armored. That means I could kick your ass in a fight, you know.\"\n\n\n\"Please, I\u0027m a Ratling. We only get this old if we\u0027re cunning and willing to do anything to survive. Plus, you are only, what, seven months old?\"\n\n\n\"Five, asshole,\" she replies. \"Joining the retinue of a paladin at five months is much more impressive than taking twelve years to do so. Twelve, right?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" you nod.\n\n\nYou spend the next hour talking about everything from Ratlings versus Raaz and why humans are stupid enough to ride horses when Giant Rats and Chariot Beetles are obviously much better steeds. Then, you spot the town on the horizon.\n\n\n\"Provident! Let\u0027s go!\" Mira yells, speeding up.\n\n\n\"And onto the next adventure!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go, then,\" you say, spurring on your Giant Rat. \n\n\nYou speed up, heading towards the town. After a few minutes you arrive. A centaur, a Raaz, a Ratling and a human with a dying man in tow almost immediately catches the guards attention. A group of guards arrives, pointing their spears at you.\n\n\n\"Hey! State your name and intention!\" one of them yells.\n",

Cheung, Faust, get the paladin.\"\n\n\nTwo guards rush forward, grabbing Redmond and lifting him into the air. They carry him off, and Scampers scampers after them. You move quickly through the town to a caravan at the edge of town. You climb over Scampers and follow Redmond as he\u0027s dragged inside.\n\n\n\"How the fuck do I go in there?\" Mira complains loudly.\n\n\n\"Wait outside!\" Dikiz says as she rushes inside. \n\n\nInside, a young woman mixes potions, turning around. You pause, staring at her. She\u0027s very beautiful, with pale skin and long, ebony black hair. Her eyes and wide and shockingly blue.\n\n\n\"Ah look, a new patient,\" she says.\n\n\nShe grabs a pair of gloves, slipping them on and walks forward, grabbing Redmond and leading him to a seat.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s the ailment?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s been poisoned with Manasa Grass Oil,\" you say.\n\n\nYou watch as the alchemist begins searching through her potions and what she has at her disposal, frowning. \n\n\n\"It\u0027s... I\u0027ll be honest, it\u0027s not optimistic.\"\n\n\nShe grabs a book, flicking through it before stopping on a page, frowning.\n\n\n\"Ah... it appears I don\u0027t have what\u0027s needed to help him.\"\n\n\n\"Where do we get it?\" the captain asks.\n\n\n\"Deep within the grove. At least a day\u0027s journey into it.\"\n\n\n\"How far are we from the grove?\"\n\n\n\"At least a day,\" the Captain says.\n\n\n\"Hmm... we\u0027ll last about two, maybe three days.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll send a rider to gather what you need,\" the Captain says.\n\n\n\"No, it\u0027ll be a two day journey either way. He won\u0027t last that. You\u0027d need to take him with you and make the potion there.\"\n\n\n\"What can we do?\" Flynn asks. \"Can you help us?\"\n\n\nFlynn stares into the Alchemist\u0027s eyes as they go quiet.\n\n\n\"Hey Flynn, remember that old guy who mentored us? Reddington or something? Yeah, he\u0027s dying in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"I could come with you to the grove to make the potion,\" the Alchemist says. \"I\u0027m due a trip there to refresh my stock. It would take about three days with the carriage, but we could make it.\"\n\n\n\"Dikiz, Ritz, go restock on supplies,\" Flynn says, pulling a satchel of golden coins from his satchel and handing it to you. \"I\u0027ll deal with the alchemist.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s Anna,\" the alchemist says. \"Take guards with you so the shopkeepers serve you.\n\n\n\"Um... OK,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go,\" you say, walking outside.\n\n\nYou head alongside Dikiz, Mira and the Captain as the town guards disperse to continue their regular duties, towards the general store.\n\n\n\"So what did they say?\" Mira asks. \"Are we slitting his throat?\"\n\n\n\"No! Hell, take it easy!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"We need to head to the Grove to get the herbs and ingredients ready to cure him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh for fuck\u0027s sake! We don\u0027t need a detour! Hang on, don\u0027t we need a nature spirit for the plan?\"\n\n\n\"We do,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, maybe this won\u0027t be a waste of time. We head to the grove, kidnap a nature spirit, find whatever herbs, maybe bury the paladin, then head off towards the mountains for that Titan blood.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re right,\" you say. \"Hey, Dikiz? I have a question about social shit.\"\n\n\n\"Not my specialty, but fire,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Do you think there was anything going on between that Alchemist and Flynn?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean \"going on\"? Like, they almost started mating in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"Oh great. So we basically just got a random fuck buddy for Flynn.\"\n\n\n\"Jealous?\" Mira laughs.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go shopping,\" you say.\n\n\nYou resupply on everything you need, and soon arrive back at the caravan, where Flynn and Anna are talking.\n\n\n\"Anna is going to accompany us on our quest in exchange for a note of pardons from Paladin Redmond to allow her to import certain illegal potions and herbs,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Great,\" you say. \"So the party\u0027s growing by one.\"\n\n\n\"We need to go,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We do,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get riding then,\" Mira says. \n\n\nYou turn to the Captain, who stares at you.\n\n\n\"Thanks for your help,\" you say.\n\n\n\"My pleasure, ratling. You\u0027re a credit to your species. As are your centaur and Raaz friend.\"\n\n\n\"Hurry the fuck up, shit for brains!\" Mira yells, as the carriage begins to pull away. \n\n\n\"Maybe just teh Raaz and you,\" the Captain says.\n",

  "page 138": "\"Fine, stay then. The Prophecy is simple. We need the the blood of a Titan. A spirit of nature. The Ancient Key of the Ninth Beetle. The writings of Stephen the Mad. Getting the Titan blood will be an issue. Now, the Titans are long extinct, killed in the great Titanic War where they were overthrown from their positions as physical gods by Man, Raaz, Centaur, Reptillian, Ratling, Nature Spirits, the whole fucking shebang. Hell, even the Ghost Kings were there that day. We took the Titans\u0027 thrones over us and regained our freedom, but they weren\u0027t driven extinct. No, they survived as beasts. They were driven to the mountains, where they ended up breeding with the mortal Giants that lay there. They ended up not only breeding with them, but inbreeding. Inbreeding and fucking giants eventually left them as what they are today.\"\n\n\n\"The Titans are extinct today. So are the Giants.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, they merged into a horrible subspecies with all the faults and none of the benefits. The Ogres. A horrible species of walking, thinking mouths. Fuck, that\u0027s not even true. They don\u0027t think. Still, they have Titan blood in them. Their chieftains even more so. We need to find one of their chieftains, and recruit them.\"\n\n\n\"OK, recruit an Ogre Chieftain. It\u0027s hard, but if we stuff enough cows down its throat, we\u0027ll be fine,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"A nature spirit. They held keep nature intact or whatever nonsense. I\u0027ve never trusted them personally. Anyhow, we need to recruit one of them, as well.\"\n\n\n\"OK, they tend to be trouble, complaining about every single bit of wood chopped down, but we can deal with them. What else?\" Flynn asks. \n\n\n\"The Ancient Key of the Ninth Beetle. The Ancient Raaz Prophet forged nine keys, eight of which were used at various prophetic times such as sealing off the magic gateway created by the infamous Sigmund the Black, or closing the mountain path itself through cave ins to crush the Titan army. Only the ninth has gone unused. The nomadic Raaz that populate the desert hold this key as sacred, and understandably so. We need to retrieve it.\"\n\n\n\"Now that is going to be hard. They\u0027ll never give us that key.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that\u0027s going to be a hard one. That\u0027s why we\u0027re going to get it next.\" \n\n\n\"Is that everything, then?\"\n\n\n\"One last thing. We need the writings of Stephen the Mad.\"\n\n\n\"Where are they?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"See, that\u0027s the problem. Giving his name, I\u0027m sure you can guess Stephen\u0027s fate. He went mad at the height of his writing career, dreadfully so. Then, he wrote the an ancient, huge ballad known as the Scéal. Most of it was nonsense, mind you, but one part was noticeable as being somewhat sane. He said, in what might\u0027ve been his only sane moment, that this was the code to a door. It\u0027s necessary as part of the prophecy to get this code.\"\n\n\n\"Well, where is it?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"I have no idea, admittedly. It\u0027s said he burnt all copies but one, took it off with him and joined the Broken Tribes. So that\u0027s where I plan on visiting to track it down.\"\n\n\n\"So recruit an angry Ogre, recruit a nature spirit who most likely hates not only us, but the civilization we\u0027re a part of, steal a key from the Raaz, who may I remind you have armies of massive Sand Worms, and then we track down a piece of writing that could easily be long gone, all in the company of a Ratling who\u0027ll most likely slit our throats while we sleep?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Well then. Terrific,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Redmond sighs. \"But it\u0027s necessary.

The Reapers are dead now, and in exchange, we\u0027ve been gifted with life,” you say.\n\n\n\"Life?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"These are Anna and Flynn\u0027s twins.\"\n\n\n\"How are they here?\" Dikiz asks.\n\n\nYou shrug.\n\n\n\"What do we do with them?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m to look after them,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Uh... there\u0027s babies here,\" Orut says.\n\n\nYou bend over, grabbing the two babies.

Let’s get out of here.”\n",

Reddington or something? Yeah, he\u0027s dying in front of us.\"\n\n\n\"I could come with you to the grove to make the potion,\" the Alchemist says. \"I\u0027m due a trip there to refresh my stock. It would take about three days with the carriage, but we could make it.\"\n\n\n\"Dikiz, Ritz, go restock on supplies,\" Flynn says, pulling a satchel of golden coins from his satchel and handing it to you. \"I\u0027ll deal with the alchemist.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s Anna,\" the alchemist says. \"Take guards with you so the shopkeepers serve you.\n\n\n\"Um... OK,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s go,\" you say, walking outside.\n\n\nYou head alongside Dikiz, Mira and the Captain as the town guards disperse to continue their regular duties, towards the general store.\n\n\n\"So what did they say?\" Mira asks. \"Are we slitting his throat?\"\n\n\n\"No! Hell, take it easy!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"We need to head to the Grove to get the herbs and ingredients ready to cure him,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh for fuck\u0027s sake! We don\u0027t need a detour! Hang on, don\u0027t we need a nature spirit for the plan?\"\n\n\n\"We do,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh, maybe this won\u0027t be a waste of time. We head to the grove, kidnap a nature spirit, find whatever herbs, maybe bury the paladin, then head off towards the mountains for that Titan blood.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re right,\" you say. \"Hey, Dikiz? I have a question about social shit.\"\n\n\n\"Not my specialty, but fire,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Do you think there was anything going on between that Alchemist and Flynn?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean \"going on\"?

So we basically just got a random fuck buddy for Flynn.\"\n\n\n\"Jealous?\" Mira laughs.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go shopping,\" you say.\n\n\nYou resupply on everything you need, and soon arrive back at the caravan, where Flynn and Anna are talking.\n\n\n\"Anna is going to accompany us on our quest in exchange for a note of pardons from Paladin Redmond to allow her to import certain illegal potions and herbs,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Great,\" you say. \"So the party\u0027s growing by one.\"\n\n\n\"We need to go,\" you say.\n\n\n\"We do,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get riding then,\" Mira says. \n\n\nYou turn to the Captain, who stares at you.\n\n\n\"Thanks for your help,\" you say.\n\n\n\"My pleasure, ratling.

We\u0027ve checked with our Rune Seers, and they see the best path forward is to allow you access the Ninth Key.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, terrific,\" you say, your whiskers flickering with excitement.\n\n\n\"The key can only remain in the hands of a Raaz,\" the Chieftain says. \"Thus, we\u0027ll be hiring out one of our finest Raaz with you, Dikiz.\"\n\n\n\"Youngest,\" Redmond says.\n\n\n\"Due to our lifespan and the possibility of the quest stretching on, we had a limited choice for those young enough.

Let\u0027s go, Ritz and Flynn.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, let\u0027s haul ass and get out of here,\" Flynn says. \n\n\nDikiz walks up to the pair of you, staring at you.\n\n\n\"Hello again,\" it says.\n\n\n\"Hello again? Have we met before you ask?\"\n\n\n\"I tried to play ball with you. You didn\u0027t,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Oh. Eh, sorry. My bad,\" you apologize.\n\n\n\"So, do you have genders, or whatever?

Why don\u0027t you and Flynn try give me a hand, seeing as you don\u0027t have a chance of catching anything without a bow.\"\n\n\n\"I have a bow,\" Flynn says. \n\n\n\"Yes, and I\u0027d find a better shot in Oak,\" Redmond says. \"Ritz, swing around right. Flynn, swing around left. Try scare anything in these woods in my direction so I can actually score a kill.\"\n\n\n\"Understood, you reply as Flynn nods vigorously.\n\n\nYou begin walking right at an angle, before eventually beginning to curve back around after about ten minutes of strolling. You pause, hearing snuffling nearby. You creep towards it, finding a group of young boars searching through the underbrush for food. You spot Flynn on the other side of them, creeping towards them as well. Both your eyes settle on a large, succulent one, as you creep towards it.\n",

Then, you begin setting up the tents, an act you\u0027ve managed to get quite quick at, erecting the tents in about fifteen minutes. You retrieve some firewood and kindling from the edge of the woods in which Flynn and Redmond hunt, before managing to get a fire going. You find a nearby brook, refilling the group\u0027s canteens and washing out your stew pot, before finally Flynn and Sir Redmond arrive back, carrying a small deer.\n\n\n\"We return with the spoils of bloodshed!\" Flynn yells with a grin. \"Look at this baby!\"\n\n\nRedmond smiles as he walks into the camp.\n\n\n\"Ah, everything\u0027s prepared! Well done, Ritz. You\u0027re certainly a hard-working squire. And to think Flynn almost managed to convince me to slit your throat in your sleep.\"\n\n\nFlynn gives a half-smile, which you assume, or hope, more accurately, to indicate that Redmond\u0027s joking.\n\n\nYou fashion a spit from which to begin cooking your venison while Flynn skins it, before you finally get to begin cooking, filling the camp with the delicious smell of roasted venison. Then, Khepri saunters back into the camp with Dikiz atop it.\n\n\n\"Ah, Dikiz. Did you get the supplies?\" Redmond asks.\n\n\n\"No,\" Dikiz responds simply, tossing the bag of Crowns  in front of him.\n\n\n\"Why?\" Redmond says, taken aback. \"Did something happen the town?\"\n\n\n\"It seems they\u0027ve been killed and replaced by living assholes,\" Dikiz says. \"We\u0027re behind schedule. We\u0027ll survive without it.\"\n\n\n\"Did something happen?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s just eat,\" she says.\n\n\nYou all quickly gather around the campfire as it begins to cook the venison. Flynn tells a grandiose tale of hunting down boars where he rode one for a solid mile before it got away, at which point Redmond bagged a deer and headed back. By then the meat is ready, and you quickly begin to feast, chowing down on a chunk of venison with glee. The sun sets, and with your bellies full and warm, you head to bed.\n",

You see the blurry shape of a merchant convoy on the horizon, pointing to it.\n\n\n\"Look, there actually is something new!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Thought we wouldn\u0027t see it, huh, Dikiz?\" Flynn says smugly. \"It\u0027s the merchant convoy!\"\n\n\n\"No. It was the grass,\" Dikiz says, before bursting into chittering laughter.\n\n\n\"Oh, fuck off!\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"We could do with a resupply,\" Redmond remarks.\n\n\n\"Seeing as someone couldn\u0027t even get supplies,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"Eat sand,\" Dikiz complains. \"I tried. Bastards wouldn\u0027t serve a Raaz.\"\n\n\nFlynn laughs at Dikiz\u0027s annoyance.\n\n\n\"Cool it,\" Redmond says. \"Let\u0027s ride and meet up with them.\"\n\n\nYou all ride forward towards the merchant convoy, soon catching up. The merchants are all human, so you hope you don\u0027t have any trouble.\n\n\n\"Hello there!\" Sir Redmond cries. \"Can we purchase some goods from you?\"\n\n\n\"Certainly!\" the tanned merchant leader replies, as the carriages pull to the side. \"A Paladin, his squire, a Raaz and a Ratling. You keep interesting company. What brings you out here?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027re out here searching for the writings of Steven the Mad. You don\u0027t know anything about where we could find it, do you?\"\n\n\nThe merchant flashes a pearly white, wide grin as you all dismount from your steeds. \n\n\n\"You are a lucky man, Paladin! You\u0027ve found the Crown in the shit stack, I\u0027ll tell you that!\"\n\n\n\"Do you know something?\" Redmond asks, surprised. \n\n\n\"Know something! Ha! My friend, I have something! Come inside my caravan!\"\n\n\nThe merchant leader quickly leads the lot of you into the caravan, which is stacked with goods. You pause, seeing a large piece of some type of brown parchment hanging from the wall, with small, raised writing on it.\n\n\n\"Is that it?\" you ask.\n\n\nPaladin Redmond grins.\n\n\n\"Yes, that\u0027s it. It lines up with what few fragments of his writing I\u0027ve acquired.\"\n\n\n\"I thought there\u0027d be more,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"There is. But this is the passage we need. How much?\"\n\n\n\"50\u0027000 Crowns,\" the merchant leader says.\n\n\nRedmond grimaces, before nodding.\n\n\n\"I have several diamonds of immense value. Will a trade do?\"\n\n\n\"Of course. I have a jeweler among m...!\"\n\n\n\"Attack! Attack!\" someone screams.\n\n\nYou all quickly race outside, and you freeze in your tracks. A black blur is on the horizon. You narrow your eyes, making out hundreds of horses charging towards you. \n\n\n\"Fucking hell,\" Redmond say, his mouth hanging open. \"That\u0027s a whole tribe. An entire fucking one of the Broken Tribes. Why the hell are they all here?\"\n\n\n\"I... may have offended one of them,\" the merchant leader grins.\n\n\n\"What the fuck do we do?\" Flynn says.\n",

This was my polite way of asking the ant.\"\n\n\n\"Why do you think it was me?\" Dikiz asks.\n\n\n\"Raaz are into that shit. Centaur sacrifices to their gods and shit.\"\n\n\n\"We don\u0027t even have gods, let alone sacrifices! Damn, Mira!\"\n\n\n\"If you\u0027re a mage or whatever, that shit\u0027s cool with us. But I would like to know what powers you have.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not!\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Whatever,\" Mira says. \"Now, question: are these trees moving away from us to open a path, or has my fear gotten the better of me?\"\n\n\n\"This place is alive. Like it\u0027s got some collective... intelligence, or whatever,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Is it friendly?\" Dikiz asks.\n\n\nYou shrug.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s certainly a beautiful place, isn\u0027t it? So much life. So many colors,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\nMira pauses, staring off into the woods. You see her tattooed muscles tense up, as her trot slows down.\n\n\n\"Fuck,\" she says, her voice a whisper.\n\n\nShe begins to look around nervously. Seeing the badass centaur warrior scared elicits a nervous chittering sound from Dikiz, who looks around nervously.\n\n\n\"What is it? Direbears?\"\n\n\n\"How the fuck did they sneak up on us? Oh shit, we\u0027re surrounded,\" Mira says nervously. \"We need to get out of this fucking forest before it strangles us to death. Let\u0027s get the fuck back to the plains. Wide open fields, that\u0027s what I need.\"\n\n\n\"Mira! What the fuck are you talking about?!\" you say.\n\n\n\"Look closely,\" she says.\n\n\nYou peer through the trees nervously. You see shadow figures moving quickly around you in all directions.\n\n\n\"Shit, I see them too,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Dikiz, very slowly ride up and tell Flynn,\" Mira says. \"I don\u0027t think they know we\u0027ve noticed them yet.\" \n\n\nDikiz rides up to the carriage, as the figures seem to get closer. Suddenly, the Grove turns against you. Roots rise up and grab Scampers\u0027 legs, binding him to the ground as the other steeds and the carriage halt. \n\n\n\"Ambush!\" Mira yells, before grunting as roots bind her legs.\n\n\nSuddenly, figures arrive all around you as you freeze. Satyrs appear out of the trees wielding swords, axes and spears. Wolves appear, weaving in and out of the trees stare up at you with malice. Several monstrous creatures burst into view, huge humanoid creatures made from gnarled trees with grimacing faces staring at you. A handful of beautiful women who seem to be integrated into the Grove itself, with vines wrapped around their bodies and leaves wrapped in their hair stare at you. Despite being in mortal danger and quite possibly about to be murdered, you do let your gaze drop to their breasts, buttocks and genitals.\n\n\nWell, now you\u0027re erect in an ambush. Terrific.\n\n\nOutside the thoughts of your little head, you\u0027re in the center of a brutal ambush. None of them strike, yet. There\u0027s a moment of silence as they just stare at you.\n",

The gleeful villagers march behind you, ready to burst forward and slaughter.\n\n\n“Have the utmost mercy, the utmost compassion and the utmost efficiency.

You lie atop the carriage, staring up at the sky as clouds pass by. Eventually, the sky darkens.\n\n\n\"Ritz! We\u0027re attacking!\" Flynn says.\n\n\nYou nod, heading into the village slowly. Your villagers easily dispatch their guards before they can even scream in terror, and from the final looks on their faces it\u0027s clear that that was what they were going to do. You watch as your bestial allies sneak into houses to begin the killing.\n",

You simply ride past them, ignoring their shouts for you to halt and their orders to you to reveal your business. You can’t be bothered with that. You ride towards the town hall, thankfully catching the town lord as he saunters down the steps dressed in gold and fine silk. He frowns when he sees you, pushing his glasses further up the bridge of his nose.\n\n\n“May I help you?” \n\n\n“We’re raiders. We’re here for your treasures. If you want to live, have your people gather up in one place. Do as we say and no one will be hurt.”\n\n\nUnfortunately, thinking you just simple raiders and seeing only a trail of unarmed villagers following you rather than the fierce ogres they’re used to, the Lord only chuckles. It seems they can’t see the horrible monstrosities for what they are.\n\n\n“Guards, kill them all!” he says.\n\n\nThe guards armed with bows fire, releasing a hail of arrows fly into you. Flynn manages to dodge, yelling an order for his monsters to reveal their form, and although you’re sure your killers will be slaughtered, it doesn’t change the fact that you quickly bleed to death.\n",

Explore universes!\"\n\n\n\"What?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I created this world for the purpose of telling stories. An entire universe of adventures! Unfortunately, things have began getting repetitive. The first Titanic War was a tremendous tale of adventure, men fighting giants! The second was a complete remake and a bore!

He\u0027s human, or looks so, but stands eight foot tall with incredibly pale skin. He\u0027s incredibly skinny and completely naked, though his body is featureless.

I showed him billions of those potential fates... he suffered through an eternity in just a few minutes fo your time. He watched this happen to him, and Anna, and Redmond, and you, and his kid. I\u0027m sure it broke his mind a bit, but after experiencing that, I imagine he\u0027d kill a million worlds to prevent anyone from suffering that fate, especially those he loved.\"\n\n\n\"So, that\u0027s the fate of everyone?\" you ask. \"To be trapped in a world like that?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no.

Your forces have captured quite a few weapons from the various human cities such as catapults and ballista’s, along with those capable of crewing them, who you’ve kept alive for the short-term in the hope they’ll be of some use.

They explode, spitting flames and metal as the cannons\u0027 payloads slam into the walls. Immediately, you see cracks beginning to appear in the walls.

I don\u0027t even feel bad about killing you.\"\n\n\nFlynn twirls his blade, beheading him. He grabs the crown as his head falls free of his crown. \n\n\n\"Do you want this?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll pass,\" you say, surprising even yourself.\n\n\nFlynn drops the crown, before kicking it away.

In death his rage-filled expression stays on his face, staring up at you.\n\n\n\"What now?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We need to deal with the last survivors. In slaughtering the human empire, the ratlings that survive through raiding will be wiped out soon.

Soon, you reach a large room filled to the brim with massive iron vats.\n\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Biological weapons, created from diseased corpses, human excrement and worse,\" the Reaper says, quite matter of factly. \"We\u0027ve captured it\u0027s creator.\"\n\n\nAn elderly man is dragged forward. He has a long grey beard soaked with blood, staring at you.\n\n\n\"H-hello,\" he says, terrified.\n\n\n\"What is this?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"I am in charge of creating biological weapons for the empire. They were to be used on the Ratling Clans to purge their burrows. It poisons the earth and prevents any life from growing and killing all life.\"\n\n\n\"Interesting,\" Flynn says. \"Villager, take him to the dungeons. He might be of use to us.\"\n\n\nThe villager nods, dragging the man away.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll put that aside for later,\" Flynn says. \"Now, what we were discussing?\"\n\n\n\"The issues we were faced with that remained,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Oh yes,\" Flynn says. \"Orut Skull-Taker has combined the Ogre tribes under his command.\"\n\n\n\"So we head to wipe them out?\"\n\n\n\"It gets worse. He\u0027s taken them into an alliance with Tilia and the Grove. The grove has expanded into ogre territory. They\u0027re quite powerful. We can defeat them, but it\u0027ll take the both of us.\"\n\n\nYou nod. \n\n\n\"There\u0027s also the Broken Tribes and the Raaz. They\u0027ve also formed an alliance, and you wouldn\u0027t guess through who.\"\n\n\n\"Dikiz and Mira,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Right. I\u0027m not even sure how they did it, but I suppose it\u0027s fear of us that binds them. They\u0027re forming a massive evacuation West to escape us. We need to go after them as well.\"\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s prepare for war then,\" you say softly.\n\n\n\"Who dies first?\"\n",

What the fuck did you do to me?!\" you shout, standing up.\n\n\nYou go to draw your sword, before pausing.\n\n\n\"Oh good, you\u0027re learning!\" the Tourist grins.  \"I was... \"talking\", to translate it as best I can, to an old friend, and we brought up Crexiciliatanian\u0027s little game. He thought you\u0027d be an interesting client.\" \n\n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I have a merchant I\u0027d like to talk to. The Merchant can be his name.

He waves a hand, as a seat appears in front of the table. \n\n\n\"Well, I\u0027ll leave you two to talk. It\u0027ll definitely be interesting to see what happens with the rat, won\u0027t it?\" the Tourist says. \"Oh yes, before I go, here.\"\n\n\nThe Tourist places down a gold coin on the table, smiling.\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you say, examining it. \"This is just a single Throne.

That would be very damaging to poor Crexiciliatanian. Let me find a few things worth worth what you have.\"\n\n\nThe Merchant opens his hands, and a black light appears in it, dancing around.\n\n\n\"Are you a rat? Like me?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"No. This form is only to calm you. The offer I have is simple. Knowledge versus power versus happiness.\"\n\n\nThe Merchant puts his hand on the table, sliding it along as three cards appear. He flips them, revealing an image of a man reading a book wearing glasses, an image of strong knight wielding a sword and an image of a grinning man dancing with a goblet of wine in his hands.\n\n\n\"What\u0027s knowledge?\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re curious about me, aren\u0027t you? That coin will buy you a glance at my true form, if you\u0027d like. I\u0027ll even throw in my name, if you want.\"\n\n\n\"And the power?\"\n\n\n\"Nothing over the top. There are an infinite amount of universes, Ritz,\" the Merchant says, a syringe filled with a black, ink like substance inside it. \"I have a universe in mind. Almost the exact same as yours, with the unfortunate change that you were a stillborn.\"\n\n\nYou pause, staring at him in confusion.\n\n\n\"Another me that died?\"\n\n\n\"Exactly, one that never got to be. A shadow of you. His essence is inside here. With a brief injection, I can give you him.\"\n\n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\"It should give you quite a few powers. That\u0027s really all you need to understand.\"\n\n\n\"And the joy?\" \n\n\n\"You\u0027re a useless pawn in your world of no importance. I have a wondrous location I could transport you to, free of your world, where your existence would be pure, unending joy.

The lack of massive, burly Ogres mounting the walls assures you that there’s no patrols or look-outs. It seems the Ogres are too stupid to expect an attack, or perhaps you and your allies are just the only ones stupid enough to climb a mountain to attack the fortress of a clan of Ogres. Either way, you have options here.\n\n\n“What do we do? Do we knock on the door, or…?” Flynn asks.\n\n\n“We have two options. We can sneak in so that we can skip having to negotiate our way past a tribe of savage ogres, or we can simply knock on the front door and see where our luck carries us.”\n\n\n“What about fighting?” Mira asks. “Do we need the Ogre to be willing? If not, we could easily wipe out the tribe barring him and drop a boulder on his skull.”\n\n\n“We do need him to be willing,” Redmond says. “So, sneak or talk. Shall we put it to a vote? Who wants to sneak?”\n\n\nA nervous Tilly, a terrified Anna and the blanket creature that consumed Dikiz raises their hands.

You hack open the face of one of the bugs, before dodging another and running your sword through his head. One of the creatures grabs your arm and you elbow him off you, before another grabs your other arm, twisting it as the sword falls from your hand. Your other hand is grabbed and they lift you up as suddenly their wings buzz and they take flight, pulling you into the air. They drag you into the air as you scream in terror, flying towards the meat. They drag you above one of the pods, which unlike the others it partially burst. Suddenly, they drop you, and you fall through the air, slamming into the pod as it envelops you. Ooze surrounds your body as the blister reforms, trapping you inside. Your senses are taken, as you feel nothing but the warmth of the blister. Suddenly, your energy is drained from you, and you lose consciousness.\n",

Rat boy prime, not you three goons.\"\n\n\nYou pause, looking around. It seems while you got stuck in a cage, Dikiz was trapped in a palace. The large, spacious tent has a large bed, a wardrobe, a large mirror and several other luxuries.\n\n\n\"Fucking Cestode! She\u0027s a slave?\" one of the rats asks.\n\n\n\"She\u0027s being treated like royalty!\" another complains.\n\n\n\"Hurry up!\" Mira hisses.\n\n\nYou cut a long strip of cloth from the bed, handing it to her.\n\n\n\"Thanks. Sorry for bitching, Whiskers. I\u0027m a bit pissed off today. I feel like I got stabbed in the back and the leg by a cockroach who was too stupid to realize what I was doing,\" she says, wrapping the strip of cloth around her stomach to bandage her wound. \"We have good trading relationships with the Raaz, so we keep their prisoners treated very well to keep that relationship up. If we lose them as a partner we have nothing else.\"\n\n\n\"Where\u0027d you even get a knife in here?\" you ask Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Oh, the flowers in the vase are poisonous. I pressed them into an oil and poured it into the wine.\"\n\n\n\"Flowers and wine? Fucking bug cunt. You\u0027re lucky I don\u0027t fuck...!\" one of the rats bitches.\n\n\n\"Hey! Cool it before I cut off your dick and force it down your throat!\" you spit.\n\n\n\"Sorry, boss,\" he says. \n\n\n\"Well anyway, I offered the wine to the guard and knocked him out. I heard you guys coming so I grabbed his knife and hid. Not the best security measures, leaving those flowers in here.\"\n\n\n\"Well see, we didn\u0027t actually know that you were such a flaming faggot that you knew what flowers did what,\" Mira says. \"Fuck, your kind dwell in deserts for fuck\u0027s sake.\"\n\n\n\"Books,\" Mira shrugs. \"I\u0027m sorry for stabbing you.\"\n\n\nMira reaches her arm around, gently dipping her finger into the wound and covering it with flood, which she then flicked at Dikiz.\n\n\n\"Yeah, that apology healed the wound. Te-fucking-rrific. Let\u0027s go.\"\n\n\nMira turns as she begins to trot out of the tent, and you walk after her. You leave the tent, stepping over the dead centaur.\n\n\n\"Pathetic. I thought he fell asleep on guard,\" Mira says. \"Instead, he accepted wine from a prisoner. Either way he was a weak fool who deserved to die.\"\n\n\n\"I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d die,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"He was a slaver. He deserves it,\" you say.\n\n\nYou walk into the armory, nodding to all the other rats. They gleefully follow, eyes filled with bloodlust. You hurry through the camp, trying to remain quiet. Thankfully, long days of riding miles across the savannah have left the centaurs as exhausted, heavy sleepers. You come across a single patrol of one centaur, who\u0027s so bored he doesn\u0027t notice until the slew of ratling weapons attacks from the shadows, hacking him apart. \n\n\nYou keep walking, soon arriving at an opening among the tents under a tarp suspended by several poles. About two dozen humans are there, chained to large stakes in the ground. Two centaurs stand there, chatting idling. You don\u0027t speak their tongue, but from their hand gestures you presume they\u0027re talking about tits. Such charming creatures.\n\n\nMira whistles, calling them over. As soon as they\u0027re close enough, the ratlings rush them, bursting forward. They grab him, hacking them apart before they can even react, before gleefully hacking apart their bodies.\n\n\n\"Is there a key for the human slaves?\" you ask.\n\n\nMira draws out a key, tossing it to you. A few human slaves have woken up from the noise, and stare on wordlessly. You raise the key, looking at them. \n\n\n\"We\u0027re getting the fuck out of here, understood? I\u0027ll let you out, you follow my orders, yes?\"\n\n\nThe humans who are awake nod, and begin waking up their allies. \n\n\n\"Ritz!\" Flynn says. \"Dikiz!\"\n\n\n\"You can tell me apart from the other rats? Cool, maybe you\u0027re a better friend than I thought,\" you say.\n\n\nYou toss one of the humans the key and they begin to unlock themselves, as the ratlings distribute the spare weapons they carry. Flynn grabs a sword, standing up.\n\n\n\"It seems you made a few more friends,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Look, to cut our reunion short, we need to find Paladin Redmond and get out of here.\"\n\n\n\"Uh... boss?\" a ratling asks. \n\n\nYou all turn to see a centaur standing in the opening between camps. He stares at you all without a word.\n\n\n\"Orders?\" a ratling asks.\n\n\nThe centaur stares on, perhaps confused.\n\n\n\"Uh...\" you say.\n\n\nFinally, the centaur realizes that he shouldn\u0027t be staring, and lets out a roar in his tongue.\n\n\n\"Fuck! Carve a path to the horses!\"\n\n\nYou hear the shouts of dozens of centaurs and humans rising from their sleep. Time to get the fuck out of here.\n",

  "page 313": "After about an hour, with the sky turning dark, a centaur rides up to check on you, a burning torch that illuminates the long, stalky grass in his hands. You edge towards the side of the cage, waiting. He peers through the bars, staring at all of you. Then, you strike. You grab his head, pulling it through the cage. The guard is clearly sleepy and unprepared for resistance from the seemingly docile slaves. He yells as you twist it, snapping his neck. His massive horse body smashes into the ground and you quickly grab the satchel that hangs from his side, pulling it into the cage. You find a set of keys, quickly rushing to the cage door and opening it. You head outside, grabbing his spear. The other ratlings paused, confused.\n\n\n\"You killed one! Not even a human, a centaur! They\u0027ll hang us for this! All of us!\" one of the ratlings shouts.\n\n\n\"Then decide if you want to die in a cage or die with a sword in your hands.\"\n\n\nWhile it\u0027s more likely it\u0027s brutal pragmatism that makes the decision rather than any notion of honor in dying in battle, or any notion of honor whatsoever, they begin to stand, rushing out of the cage.\n\n\n\"Centaur!\" one of them hisses, as you twist around to see the one from earlier, Mira. \n\n\nMira stands there, staring at you. You raise your spear slowly, as she stares at you. \n\n\n\"You look like a wolf staring down a piece of meat. I can\u0027t tell whether you want to kill me or fuck me.\"\n\n\nYou spit on the ground, snarling at her.\n\n\n\"Both?\" Mira smiles. \n\n\nThe ratlings from the cage surround you, staring at her.\n\n\n\"Kill her,\" one of them snarls.\n\n\n\"You don\u0027t want to do that, rat. I\u0027m the only friend you have. You\u0027re hard to tell apart, is the one with the spear the one who accompanied the paladin.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s me,\" you nod. “Drop your weapons, or I kill you.\"\n\n\nMira pauses, looking genuinely surprised. \n\n\n\"You\u0027re holding a spear a fair distance away. I\u0027m a fucking centaur warrior. Do you actually think you can kill me?\"\n\n\nYou pause, not really knowing what to say. \n\n\n\"Relax, I\u0027m here to help.\"\n\n\n\"Why would you help?\" you ask, trying to be threatening but coming off as more nervous.\n\n\n“I pledged my life to follow Steven the Fair’s writing. In it, he said some day a hero will arrive, and it will be our duty to pass on his writings.”\n\n\n“How do you know that’s us?” you ask.\n\n\n“Not ‘us’. The human boy. Eyes like the sky, hair like gold, a scar on his wrist. The Great Chieftain refuses to listen, but I’m getting you out of here.\"\n\n\nYou wave a hand at the other Ratlings.\n\n\n\"I have friends now, and I\u0027m not leaving them,\" you see.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ve noticed. God, yours are an ugly people, aren\u0027t they?\"\n\n\n\"Fuck you!\" one of the ratlings shouts.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll skullfuck your corpse!\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m going to gnaw off your tits and fuck you in the horse pussy, cunt!\"\n\n\nYou remember your kind aren\u0027t the best for making alliances, and motion for them to quiet down. They do. It seems your killing of the centaur has made them respect, or more likely fear you. \n\n\n\"You want to help us. Get us weapons,\" you say. \n\n\n\"I don\u0027t trust her. She\u0027s willing to betray your whole tribe for this?\" one of the Ratlings asks.\n\n\n\"The strong conquers the weak. That\u0027s a fact of the plains. If you\u0027re able to rebel successfully, they failed to be strong.\"\n\n\n\"Fine. We trust you.\"\n\n\n\"We need to get to the armory. Thankfully, it\u0027s next to the Raaz. She’s the next least guarded of your allies.\"\n\n\n\"OK,\" you say. \n\n\n\"Terrific. Let\u0027s try to get a rabble of rats through the camp.\"\n\n\n\"A group of rats is called a mischief,\" you say. \"Let\u0027s cause some.\"\n\n\n\"Cute,\" she sighs. \"Follow.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and follow her as the group of you creep through the grass towards one of the tents. A centaur lies outside, his equine legs folded up as his body lies on them, a spear on the ground next to him. He seems fast asleep. Next to it is a massive tent, guarded by two centaurs. \n\n\n\"There\u0027s the armory,\" Mira says.\n\n\nMira trots up to the two guards, twirling her swords around. One of the centaurs asks her something, but Mira doesn\u0027t answer. Instead, she twirls and slashes both of her weapons, beheading the two centaurs with one swing. She turns, looking back at you all, nodding her head. The ratlings burst forward, quiet but eager. They quickly hurry into the tent, and you rush in after them, tossing your spear aside for a good, old-fashioned sword. Then, you turn to the other Ratlings, all of who are gleefully arming themselves with steel.\n\n\n\"Stay here and stay quiet. If you can carry more weapons than you need, do. We\u0027ll need to arm the other slaves.\" \n\n\nWith that done, you head to the other tent to find Dikiz. You pause, noticing the centaur outside, collapsed on the ground.\n\n\n\"Did one of the rats kill him?\" you question.\n\n\n“No, he\u0027s asleep. What a pathetic example of a centaur. Come on, let’s get past him. Grab his spear, first. Then, finish the idiot off for his shitty abilities in staying awake. Or spare him. Seems like your choice’ll be interesting enough to tell me whether you’re as stupid as I thought you were.\"\n",

  "page 797": "Due to the hostile nature of the Raaz and Broken Tribes\u0027 desert and savannah homelands, a vast search for the nomadic peoples was not necessary in your early movements, only capturing the various oases and rivers that provide the most valuable resource to life that there is: water. With that, you crush them. Unable of accessing the water sources on their way, they begin to take casualties. Soon, it\u0027s clear that without resupplying, they\u0027ll be destroyed.\n\n\nSeeing only one option, they strike. The entire evacuation throws itself at one of the oases defended by Reapers. They lose countless lives attacking the heavily defended and fortified area, and leave themselves surrounded by your entire force in a badly defended position. All in all, they\u0027re exhausted, demoralized and screwed.\n",
  "page 316": "You turn and begin sprinting alongside the rest of the slaves after Mira. You run desperately as you here the entire tribe awaken. You soon reach a pair of two large white tents.\n\n\n\"Right!\" Mira yells.\n\n\nYou rush into the tent. Inside, Sir Redmond stands there in a pair of tattered shorts and nothing else, covered in slashes and drenched in blood, his tattoo of a chain wrapped around his body showing. He holds a sword, pointing it at the four centaurs who surround him, all of who are heavily tattooed with black images of skulls, snakes and other horrific imagery. Mira stands next to you, as they stare at you. Redmond\u0027s eyes flick to you three.\n\n\n\"Shit, he\u0027s guarded by Soul Riders!\" Mira says. \"Dumb bastard must\u0027ve tried to escape.\"\n\n\n\"Get out of here. Take the centaur and continue the mission,\" Redmond shouts.\n\n\n\"Oh, fuck off with your petty heroism bullshit!\" Mira says, before breaking forward. She slashes at the first of the Soul Riders, before blocking a strike from a second.\n\n\n\"Attack, you dumb pricks!\" she yells at you. \n\n\nAs Mira and Redmond fight, engaging two of the Soul Riders, the third trots forward, staring at Flynn, Dikiz and you as he raises his barbed sword, bursting forward.\n",
  "page 558": "You awaken to Flynn standing over you.\n\n\n\"Come on, Redmond\u0027s making up,\" he says.\n\n\nYou stand up, hurrying towards whatever tree trunk is designated for medics.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s up!\" you hear Anna say.\n\n\nYou hurry inside to find Redmond lying there, groaning as he opens his eyes. His chest is heavily bandaged, with his chain tattoo looking like it binds his bandages to his chest.\n\n\n\"What the...?\" he groans.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s OK, just be slow,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Oh, Julianne. What are you doing here?\" Redmond says, raising a hand to caress Anna\u0027s face. \"You should be...\"\n\n\nRedmond freezes, dropping his hand. He looks confused for a moment, before rubbing his eyes and taking a deep breath.\n\n\n\"Apologies, miss, I had you confused for someone else.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s OK,\" Anna says, albeit nervously. \"You should have a bit of confusion for a small while, but in an hour you\u0027ll be fine.\"\n\n\nRedmond grimaces as he stands, before looking around.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t think you should be standing,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Please, I\u0027m fine,\" Redmond answers, his eyes fixing on Flynn. \"I need you to fill me in, Flynn.\"\n\n\nOver the next ten minutes Flynn explains everything about what happened since you escaped the Broken Tribal camp. Redmond nods patiently as he listens, asking a few questions every now and then. Once Flynn is finished, he pauses, resting his head on his knuckles as he thinks.\n\n\n\"The course of action is clear. We need to go ahead and recruit one of the Nymphs from this place and head to the mountains to finish our recruitment,\" he says. \"Who is the leader of this place?\"\n\n\n\"We have no leader. We are all free children of the Earth,\" one of the Nymphs says. \n\n\n\"Ah. I need a Nymph to accompany me in my quest. There is an unknown, terrible evil that needs to be dealt with for the sake of the world. Is there anyone who would be willing to accompany me and my companions?\" Redmond asks.\n\n\nThere\u0027s a moment of silence before one of them answers.\n\n\n\"Tilia might,\" the Nymph says.\n\n\n\"Ah yes, if anyone would, she would,\" another adds.\n\n\n\"Why her?\" Flynn asks curiously.\n\n\n\"Tilia is our most... violent Nymph.\"\n\n\n\"A violent Nymph?\" Redmond asks. \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a rarity.\"\n\n\n\"She\u0027s violent for a Nymph. For one of your kind, I\u0027m sure she\u0027d be a pacifist.\"\n\n\n\"You didn\u0027t seem too pacifist when you ambushed us,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re absolutely right. Tell me, will you need more time to bury your dead from the ambush?\" the Nymph says.\n\n\n\"Point taken,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Well then. Let\u0027s find her, shall we?\"\n\n\nOne of the Nymphs nods, making her way to the door.\n\n\nYou follow the Nymph as she walks outside, walking along the grass to a small grove of of Jackfruit trees. A tall girl with skin the color of cream stands there, with long auburn hair with several lillies woven in.\n\n\n\"Tilia, these men would like to talk to you,\" the Nymph says.\n\n\nTilia turns around on the balls of her feet, looking at you. You once again fail to keep your gaze from lowering to stare at her breasts and genitals, although if she notices, which she probably does, she doesn\u0027t bring it up.\n\n\n\"How can I help?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"My name is Sir Redmond. I am on a quest to fulfill an ancient prophecy, and to do so I need your help.\"\n\n\nYou watch as Redmond explains the situation to Tilia as she nods. When he finishes, she nods.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll travel with you then,\" Tilia says. \n\n\n\"Terrific,\" Redmond smiles.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll gather up my stuff and say my goodbyes,\" Tilia says.\n\n\n\"Good. I need to sit down, my head is a faint fuzzy. Can you prepare the steeds, Ritz?\"\n\n\n\"Happy to,\" you answer.\n",

You sigh, walking in after her. You push the tent flap out of your way, walking inside. Suddenly, a hooded figure leaps onto Mira as she yells in surprise. The figure, presumably Dikiz, jabs a dagger into Mira\u0027s back as she screams in pain, bucking quickly and sending Dikiz flying to the ground. Dikiz rolls and slashing at her fore leg. Mira kicks, her hoof slamming into Dikiz head and knocking her back.\n\n\n\"Damn it, you stupid cunt!\" she says, snarling. \"This was a rescue mission!\"\n\n\nDikiz pauses, spotting you, as a trio of rats with blades and axes rush in.

  "page 559": "You awaken to Flynn standing over you.\n\n\n\"Come on, you two lovebirds. Redmond\u0027s making up,\" he says.\n\n\nDikiz lifts her head off your chest and stands to her feet. You grab her claw as she pulls you up, before hurrying towards whatever tree trunk is designated for medics.\n\n\n\"He\u0027s up!\" you hear Anna say.\n\n\nYou hurry inside to find Redmond lying there, groaning as he opens his eyes. His chest is heavily bandaged, blood running along the grooves of his chain tattoo.\n\n\n\"What the...?\" he groans.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s OK, just be slow,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Oh, Julianne. What are you doing here?\" Redmond says, raising a hand to caress Anna\u0027s face. \"You should be...\"\n\n\nRedmond freezes, dropping his hand. He looks confused for a moment, before rubbing his eyes and taking a deep breath.\n\n\n\"Apologies, miss, I had you confused for someone else.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s OK,\" Anna says, albeit nervously. \"You should have a bit of confusion for a small while, but in an hour you\u0027ll be fine.\"\n\n\nRedmond grimaces as he stands, before looking around.\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t think you should be standing,\" Anna says.\n\n\n\"Please, I\u0027m fine,\" Redmond answers, his eyes fixing on Flynn. \"I need you to fill me in, Flynn.\"\n\n\nOver the next ten minutes Flynn explains everything about what happened since you escaped the Broken Tribal camp. Redmond nods patiently as he listens, asking a few questions every now and then. Once Flynn is finished, he pauses, resting his head on his knuckles as he thinks.\n\n\n\"The course of action is clear. We need to go ahead and recruit one of the Nymphs from this place and head to the mountains to finish our recruitment,\" he says. \"Who is the leader of this place?\"\n\n\n\"We have no leader. We are all free children of the Earth,\" one of the Nymphs says. \n\n\n\"Ah. I need a Nymph to accompany me in my quest. There is an unknown, terrible evil that needs to be dealt with for the sake of the world. Is there anyone who would be willing to accompany me and my companions?\" Redmond asks.\n\n\nThere\u0027s a moment of silence before one of them answers.\n\n\n\"Tilia might,\" the Nymph says.\n\n\n\"Ah yes, if anyone would, she would,\" another adds.\n\n\n\"Why her?\" Flynn asks curiously.\n\n\n\"Tilia is our most... violent Nymph.\"\n\n\n\"A violent Nymph?\" Redmond asks. \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a rarity.\"\n\n\n\"She\u0027s violent for a Nymph. For one of your kind, I\u0027m sure she\u0027d be a pacifist.\"\n\n\n\"You didn\u0027t seem too pacifist when you ambushed us,\" you say.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re absolutely right. Tell me, will you need more time to bury your dead from the ambush?\" the Nymph says.\n\n\n\"Point taken,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Well then. Let\u0027s find her, shall we?\"\n\n\nOne of the Nymphs nods, making her way to the door.\n\n\nYou follow the Nymph as she walks outside, walking along the grass to a small grove of of Jackfruit trees. A tall girl with skin the color of cream stands there, with long auburn hair with several lillies woven in.\n\n\n\"Tilia, these men would like to talk to you,\" the Nymph says.\n\n\nTilia turns around on the balls of her feet, looking at you. You once again fail to keep your gaze from lowering to stare at her breasts and genitals, although if she notices, which she probably does, she doesn\u0027t bring it up.\n\n\n\"How can I help?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"My name is Sir Redmond. I am on a quest to fulfill an ancient prophecy, and to do so I need your help.\"\n\n\nYou watch as Redmond explains the situation to Tilia as she nods. When he finishes, she nods.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll travel with you then,\" Tilia says. \n\n\n\"Terrific,\" Redmond smiles.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll gather up my stuff and say my goodbyes,\" Tilia says.\n\n\n\"Good. I need to sit down, my head is a faint fuzzy. Can you prepare the steeds, Ritz?\"\n\n\n\"Happy to,\" you answer.\n",
  "page 319": "You wait, as Ratlings burst into the tent. The Soul Rider roars, beheading one before impaling another, but as his blade goes through the Ratling, another gets a chance to stab him in the throat before another smashes his head with a mace and he\u0027s quickly hacked apart. A human slave hurls a spear through the spine, killing the Soul Rider fighting Redmond. Redmond steps forward, striking at the Soul Rider fighting Mira who is quickly struck down. With the Soul Riders dead, Redmond collapses to the ground.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get the fuck out of here!\" Mira says. \"We need to go! Get Redmond!\"\n\n\nYou run over to Redmond with Flynn. He lies there, groaning, his blood seeping into the earth.\n\n\n\"We need to patch him up,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"We need to go!\" you reply, hurrying over to the side of the tent.\n\n\nYou hurry over to the next tent, where the confiscated goods are, taking your sword and Redmond\u0027s packs back and quickly heading outside where the steeds are. Ratlings and humans alike desperately steal horses, but thankfully yours are still there. The Ratlings struggle to find horses willing to mount them, but none have tried to take Scampers, presumably knowing you as mischief leader would do terrible things to them if they tried to take the best ride. You drag Redmond onto the back of Silver, before Flynn ties Oak saddle to Silver\u0027s and climbs atop. You climb onto Scampers as you burst off.  You quickly race to the edge of the massive camp as Scampers runs as fast as he can. There\u0027s a rush of horseback slaves bursting out of the camp. You look back, seeing centaurs and human horse riders chasing behind you. \n\n\n\"They\u0027re catching up!\" Dikiz yells.\n\n\n\"Keep fucking riding!\" Mira hisses.\n\n\nA few of the slaves burst off in other directions, presumably hoping they\u0027ll be able to escape as the centaurs will chase the majority. Mira looks back, gritting her teeth. \n\n\n\"If we get outside tribal territory, they can\u0027t do shit. Only the Great Chieftain can lead a party outside of their territory, and I don\u0027t see him,\" she says.\n\n\n\"How far\u0027s that?\" Flynn shouts over the thundering roar of hooves, pre-tarsus and feet. \n\n\n\"Just keep riding.\"\n\n\nYou ride on for another ten minutes, which feels like hours A few of the slaves fall behind, where the centaurs catch up and butcher them. You feel a twinge of sympathy, but you sure as hell don\u0027t slow down. You must be getting nearer, because those following you are getting faster, clearly more desperate to catch you.\n\n\nSuddenly, Mira begins to slow down, letting out a sigh of relief. You\u0027ve passed no markers or barriers, but you see the centaurs and tribal humans behind you slow down to a halt, stopping. The slaves still with you stop with you.\n\n\n\"Are we out?\" Flynn asks. \"Ha, we are! Fuck you, you cocksuckers!\"\n\n\nOne of the centaurs throws a spear, which whistles through the air, landing feet away from Flynn who almost falls off his horse.\n\n\n\"Shit! Let\u0027s get out of here, then,\" he says.\n\n\nWith that, you continue your pace, riding. A few slaves ride up to you to thank you, before telling you about them having some burrow or town nearby and breaking away. One of them you recognize.\n\n\n\"Excuse me!\" the translator says, riding up.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re the translator, right?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I am,\" he nods.\n\n\n\"How did you escape?\" you ask. \n\n\n\"When we heard the commotion, a lot of the personal slaves made a run for it. Found you bastards getting horses to get out of here, so I grabbed one.\"\n\n\n\"Well done,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I just wanted to thank you for getting me out of there.\"\n\n\n\"Not a bother,\" you say. \n\n\nAfter about two hours, the last of the slaves have split away from your group, and you decide you\u0027re far enough away that the Great Chieftain won\u0027t venture after you as you\u0027ve reached civilization at a long road. There, you finally stop, pulling to the side of the road to check on Redmond. You rush over to him, as he still lies on the horse, groaning and bleeding heavily. You grab some bandages from his pack and do a fairly crap job of patching him up, but Mira steps forward.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re wasting your time,\" she says. \"He\u0027s poisoned.\"\n\n\n\"What?\" you ask, looking up at her suddenly. \n\n\n\"Soul Riders have their blades poisoned. Why do you think I kept dodging rather than just taking a wound and beheading my prey.\"\n\n\n\"What the fuck are Soul Riders?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"Elite centaur warriors, veterans of dozens of battles,\" Mira says. \n\n\n\"We need an antidote,\" you say. \"Dikiz, you know about flowers. What do we need?\"\n\n\n\"What poison is it?\" Dikiz asks nervously.\n\n\n\"Oil from Manasa Grass,\" Mira says.\n\n\n\"That doesn\u0027t sound too bad. Can you cure it, Dikiz?\" Flynn asks.\n\n\n\"Oh, it is. Slow-killing, but painful. It\u0027s to give the victim the chance to find an honorable death in battle after they\u0027re poisoned,\" Mira says.\n\n\n\"Um... I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t remember reading about it,\" Dikiz says.\n\n\n\"Where\u0027s the nearest town?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We could reach Provident by high noon,\" Mira says, staring up at the rising sun. \"Realistically, it\u0027s kinder to put him out of his misery now.\" \n\n\n\"Fuck off, we\u0027ll save him,\" Flynn says. \"We need to go.\"\n\n\n\"No,\" Mira says. \"We just went a great distance. We need a break.\"\n\n\n\"What, tired?\" Flynn says. \"Fucking stay here then! We\u0027ll ride on! None of us are tired!\"\n\n\n\"Are you the one that ran here, then? No, you rode here. Look at your horse. He\u0027s barely standing. Get the fuck off it and take a break.\"\n\n\nYou look at Scampers and realize she\u0027s right.\n\n\n\"Yeah, we should stay here.\"\n\n\nYou lead your steeds over to a small patch of water that birds drink from, standing out from the endless grass. They begin to drink, as you wet some rags and put them on Redmond\u0027s head to keep him cool.\n\n\n\"So, we need to talk, don\u0027t we?\" Mira says. \n\n\n\"About what?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"This prophecy. I\u0027ve been dying to know what you know about it, because I have what could be described as gibberish tattooed on me because of it.\"\n\n\nYou turn to Flynn, who perhaps knows the most about it compared to the rest of you.\n\n\n\"We need to get several things. The writings of Steven the Mad. The Key of the eighth beetle.\"\n\n\n\"Ninth,\" Dikiz corrects.\n\n\n\"Whatever. We also need the blood of a Titan, meaning a Giant Chieftain in its least diluted form, and a Nature Spirit.\"\n\n\n\"Then?\" Mira asks.\n\n\n\"We go to a location at the highest mountain in the land, in its deepest cave. There, we, or me, to be honest, face off against an ancient and horrible evil to stop it from emerging into the realm.\"\n\n\n\"Ancient and horrible evil? How vague.\"\n\n\n\"It\u0027s... unknowable. Its from another world, so there aren\u0027t words that could describe it that our tongues could even say.\"\n\n\nSuddenly, you feel a need to go walk off into the grass for a few minutes. You don\u0027t know why, but it\u0027s a strong need.\n\n\n\"Uh, I need to go to the bathroom,\" you say, standing up.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t stray too far,\" Dikiz says, as you walk off into the grasslands.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking, you feel the need to lie down. You do so, lying in the long grass, and close your eyes.\n\n\n\"Now open!\" a voice says.\n",

Then, get some clothes, and a new blade.\"\n\n\n\"Understood,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"I need to find the boy. He lives in a small village nearby. You do your tasks, and I\u0027ll meet you in the town tavern when I\u0027m done.\" \n\n\n\"Understood,\" you say.\n",

A centaur, a Raaz, a Ratling and a human with a dying man in tow almost immediately catches the guards attention. A group of guards arrives, pointing their spears at you.\n\n\n\"Hey! State your name and intention!\" one of them yells.\n",

He grimaces at the site of you, looking at you with pure disgust, before he smiles, hiding his hatred of your kind.\n\n\n\"Hello, sir! You\u0027re the paladins creature, aren\u0027t you?\"\n\n\n\"Squire,\" you correct.\n\n\n\"Ah, yes. What can I get you?\" \n\n\n\"I need clothes.\"\n\n\n\"Of course. You\u0027d be a boys large, if I may say so myself. That section is right over there.\"\n\n\nYou nod, walking over to section he\u0027s pointed out. You assemble a few sets of clothing: pairs of boots, pants, shirts and a jacket. Plain, brown cloth clothes with leather boots, but they\u0027ll suffice.\n\n\nSuddenly, the man appears, staring at your selection.\n\n\n\"No, no, no!\" the man chides. \"Do you want to dress like a peasant? A fool? No, here\u0027s what your want!\"\n\n\nThe man points out a much fancier set of clothing: a fancy, long pair of black pants, a black jacket with golden buttons with a navy shirt underneath and a set of polished black boots.\n\n\n\"Here is the garb of a true squire! This is what you want, my friend!\"\n\n\nYou look at the price tags, realizing this one outfit will cost the same as all the others. It\u0027d certainly improve your standing, though, and it is very fancy garb.\n",

You walk up to the counter, to find a tall, lanky man staring at you.\n\n\n\"We don\u0027t serve ratlings,\" the man says. \"If it were up to me, one of the guards would\u0027ve impaled you.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m here on a Paladin\u0027s orders.\"\n\n\n\"Do I look like I care, ratfuck? Get out of here.\"\n\n\n\"I need a saddle, and I\u0027m not leaving without one,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I ain\u0027t got no saddles that fit for Giant Rats, dumbass. Get the fuck out of here.\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll take the widest saddle you have,\" you say. \"If you want, I can get Paladin Redmond, but he\u0027s not in the best of moods.\"\n\n\n\"Fuckin\u0027 Paladins,\" the man complains. \"Twenty Crowns, understood?\"\n\n\nYou fish out twenty Crowns from your pouch, although it takes some time for you to manage to successfully count it. You throw it on the table, and the man hands you a large, black leather saddle.\n\n\n\"Take it and get the fuck out. No refunds,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Thank you kindly,\" you smile back at him, your whiskers tingling with excitement at being served in a human town.\n\n\nYou walk with the saddle outside, and find Scampers. The townspeople are terrified of it, thankfully, and aren\u0027t bothering it. You affix the saddle onto the Giant Rat, tying it into place. You clamber onto Scampers, sitting into place. It fits fairly well, to your surprise. You suppose the saddle-maker didn\u0027t want you coming back in and scaring away his customers.\n",

Let him get his anger out,\" Redmond says.\n\n\nOrut dives towards Dinner only for Dikiz to quickly slap Dinner on the behind, causing him to bleat and run ahead quickly, just escaping Orut\u0027s fingers. Orut lets out an earsplitting roar, before moving to a sitting position. He wraps his arms around his knees with a sob.\n\n\n\"Stupid! Stupid plant! Stupid bug! Stupid!\" Orut begins muttering to himself.\n\n\n\"See, now I feel bad for him,\" Flynn says.\n\n\n\"It\u0027s OK!\" Redmond shouts, tossing out a piece of venison. Orut sniffles, crawling over and tossing it into his mouth.\n\n\n\"I want to eat Dinner!\" Orut complains.\n\n\n\"Dinner is a free being!\" Tilly says.\n\n\n\"Look, let\u0027s relax and stop arguing,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Yes! Ritz, you\u0027re on cook duty!\"\n\n\nYou nod, and get to work making a fire and preparing a stew. After an hour its ready and you begin passing out bowls of soup, looking around for whoever to talk to. Dikiz and Mira are conversing by themselves and Anna\u0027s a bitch, so you don\u0027t want to talk to her.

Their clawed hands grab you, and suddenly their wings buzz and they take flight, pulling you into the air. They drag you into the air as you scream in terror, flying towards the meat. They drag you above one of the pods, which unlike the others it partially burst. Suddenly, they drop you, and you fall through the air, slamming into the pod as it envelops you. Ooze surrounds your body as the blister reforms, trapping you inside. Your senses are taken, as you feel nothing but the warmth of the blister. Suddenly, your energy is drained from you, and you lose consciousness.\n",

I just need a small sample,\" Redmond says, as Orut stares at him in confusion. \n\n\nOrut pulls out the sword, offering it to you. \n\n\n\"Yeah, I knew that,\" Orut says, as the blade glows brigthly. \n\n\nRedmond draws a vile of blue powder, pouring it on the blood-covered blade. He sniffs the air as a golden steam rises from the blade.\n\n\n\"Smells of Sulfur... yes, you have Titan blood in you,\" Redmond says.\n\n\nOrut smashes his fist against his chest with a grunt.\n\n\n\"Orut Skull-Taker, pure Titan and pure Ogre!\" he grins. \"Let\u0027s go.
