That day the great Mol\u0027Chu will come forth, for it has its infinite eyes set upon this realm. It will drive all creatures to the realms of insanity and torment. However, the prophecy also tells of a great hero who will rise up, and the fate of the world will lie in his hands.\nYou are not that hero. You are a Ratling, your blood as weak as can be, your lineage one of thieves and cowards. Still, with your path there\u0027s a chance for betterment. You might be able to lift yourself up and find yourself some power in this world. Power you will wield. \nThanks to WouldntItBeNice for beta-reading this, he was a great help. This is my longest storygame so far and I\u0027ve decided to delve into some fantasy again. Anyhow, I hope you all enjoy!"]
