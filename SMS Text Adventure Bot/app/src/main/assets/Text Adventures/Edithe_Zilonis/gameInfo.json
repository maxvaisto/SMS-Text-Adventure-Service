  "An undertaker meets a dead woman who is more alive than most of the living.\nA (mostly) illustrated story involving a very mysterious murder, ghostly romance and spirits possessing --- the dead?\nLet\u0027s not worry ourselves with the details. This is Blackwood, after all.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 11/9/19: Housekeeping and an added Bonus Update Epilogue. All your questions will be answered in time. Enjoy!\nUPDATE 3/13/20: New, better art (finally!) The original art looked like it was hastily drawn in twenty minutes as if I was completely over this story by the time for illustrations came. (You all can tell me when my art sucks, sheesh!) Enjoy!"
