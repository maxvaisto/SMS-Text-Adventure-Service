She smiled at me.\n\n\"Besides,\" she said, \"I quite like you too. I\u0027d like to hang around you a bit longer.\"\n\n\"I am not worth the Heavens,\" I said.\n\n\"Poppycock. You\u0027ve got to have someone who thinks you are. A lucky lady, or a felicitous fellow?\" She asked.\n\nShe had slipped her arm under mine, walked alongside me.\n\nAdmittedly, I was not fond of romance. It impeded my job. And besides, no one was interested in a person whose hands are always touching the dead. Women were often taken aback, and men startled, when I mentioned my occupation.\n\nThe dead couldn\u0027t judge me, and the living thought they could.\n","page 46":"\"Coffee?\" questioned Edithe Zilonis. \"Did you pay?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh you know what that means,\" she said.\n\n\"It means a met a kind person who found my rigid personality refreshing?\"\n\n\"No, it means you\u0027ll be in bed in no time, certainly,\" teased Edithe Zilonis. \"How scandalous of you, Undertaker.\"\n\nI didn\u0027t understand what was so scandalous about a good night\u0027s rest, other than not receiving one, like I had not the night prior. I was actually quite weary. But Edithe Zilonis seemed to liven me up.\n\nWe came back to my shop. It was a storefront built in the early eighteen-hundreds. The entire city of Blackwood was very dated. When the time came for buildings to have electricty, most were unequipped to do so. The first floor of my shop was still lit mostly by candles and lamps. Although I hardly minded. Perhaps I assumed the dead couldn\u0027t see me in the dark.\n\nBut the dead are mystical, I began to believe. And the trivial whispers I gave the dead were perhaps heard. But I hoped not, because the dead knew more about me than any of my family did.\n\n\"Do you have a family?\" Edithe Zilonis asked.\n\nOf course I did. I had a supportive mother and father and a very successful sister who lived in Peach City, owned a trading company. I rarely heard from her, but I assumed she was well. And Mother and Father were slowly growing old and before soon I feared I would see them in my shop.\n\nBut death did not frighten me. I was living, and life was so much more frightening.\n\nI told this to Edithe Zilonis.\n\n\"When you die, who is going to undertake you?\" she asked.\n\nI said, \"I don\u0027t know, but I hope the person treats me with as much respect as I do my own dead.\"\n\n\"Do you think you\u0027ll go to Heaven?\" Edithe Zilonis asked.\n","page 45":"Sure, the son of the owner of the Perkins Bank beside my shop was handsome enough. He had wide eyes and curly hair, both of which seemed rare in Blackwood. I believed his name was Wiatt Perkins, and when I meant believed I actually meant I quite knew his name was Wiatt Perkins.\n\nHe would come around now and then, ask me questions about my job, if I had fetched the mail today, and if there was anyone famous in the freezers.\n\nI said, No, not yet, although I would not tell you if there was, lest the population storms my shop.\n\nTo which Wiatt Perkins laughed. And I was suprisingly taken by his laugh. It was a sound I didn\u0027t often hear from the mopey dead and much less myself.\n\nI told Edithe Zilonis, \"We went out for coffee once. In fact, last week.\"\n","page 48":"It was true there were, and never would be, records of the events that transpire in Heaven nor the Hells.\n\nHeaven is often assumed to be a paradise in the clouds, where angels fly about and play musical harps, and the Gods oversee the folks there. It is guessed that each person that has gone to Heaven lives in his or her own paradise, constantly, forever and forever.\n\nNone of these theories are true, nor are they false. Even as a person who speaks to the dead, I was unsure of both Heaven and the Hells. I thought more often about Purgatory, which seemed to be just a replication of Earth, where good and bad both occur.\n\nI told Edithe Zilonis No because I hoped I would go to Purgatory, or become a ghost. I had a fear of the unknown, and I was certain about it.\n\nBut Undertaker, she said to me, Purgatory is the unknown, truly. We know at least Heaven is good and the Hells are bad.\n\nI replied, Yes, that might be true.\n\nDoes that mean you live in fear on Earth, here now? Edithe Zilonis asked.\n\nOf course. I do not want to die, but I also do not fear it.\n\nYou are a paradox, said Edithe Zilonis.\n\nPerhaps.\n","page 47":"\"Coffee?\" questioned Edithe Zilonis. \"Did you pay?\"\n\n\"I did not,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh you know what that means,\" she said.\n\n\"It means a met a kind person who found my rigid personality refreshing?\"\n\n\"No, it means you\u0027ll be in bed in no time, certainly,\" teased Edithe Zilonis. \"How scandalous of you, Undertaker.\"\n\nI didn\u0027t understand what was so scandalous about a good night\u0027s rest, other than not receiving one, like I had not the night prior.

In fact, not a living soul knew what either Heaven or the Hells were like, much less how he or she would be judged for either.\n\nHeaven, I assumed, was pleasant. It probably was a place in the sky, high above the clouds, or perhaps upon them. It probably was eternal bliss.\n\nBut I told Edithe Zilonis I was not sure if I would go there. The stipulations for the dead are varied and beyond even my comprehension.\n\nHeaven is a nice thought, and no soul is free from thinking what his or her personal Heaven would be like.\n\nMy Heaven would be being an undertaker for the rest of eternity. But the problem is, being an undertaker was probably a scarce, if impossible job in either Heaven or the Hells. But how can my Heaven exist if I am not an undertaker?\n\nEdithe Zilonis did not ponder existentialism like I did. Instead she asked, Why would you be an undertaker forever?\n\nI said, I love my job, and I love the dead.\n\nYou\u0027re mad, Edithe Zilonis said to me.\n\nPerhaps.\n","page 80":"It was after dinner. The clock read eight or nine. Edithe Zilonis held my hand tightly as we returned to the shop.\n\nI had never had such a difficult time saying Goodnight to a dead. Edithe\u0027s gentle eyes gazed over her bed, then at me, then I helped her up.\n\nShe quickly embraced me, pulled away and kissed me, and then said, \"Thank you so much, Undertaker.\"\n\n\"It is my job, my dear,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled, kissed me once more before she rested back.\n\n\"If there is any chance I can visit,\" she said, \"you know I will.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"I will be sure to become friends with your sister,\" she said.\n\n\"That would be swell.\"\n\n\"How much do you get paid for this?\"\n\n\"Not nearly enough in gold. But more than enough in satisfaction.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" Edithe Zilonis asked.\n\n\"Oh it\u0027s quite a common name. My first name is Good and my surname is Night.\"\n\nShe was about to shout at me when I said, \"Goodnight Edithe. And good luck.\"\n\nShe fell asleep then and there. I placed her arms gently on her stomach, over her pink purse. I pressed a kiss onto her forehead before I returned to bed.\n\n~~~\n\nThe night seemed delightfully long. I slept well and had not a dream. But I did muse over the day, over ghosts and possessions, over murder and Agrona, and over Edithe Zilonis.\n\nSometimes it is a comforting thought, to know that life, if anything, has a finite end. But it is disturbing to know that anyone could cause that end, dead or alive, as I discovered.\n\nHumans are exceedingly fragile, emotionally and physically, unfortunately. But they are capable of taking that knowledge and discovering how to become stronger. Edithe Zilonis was too young when she was murdered. Agrona was even younger. But Edithe did not dwell on the sadness, and I discovered neither had Agrona.\n\nEdithe Zilonis, instead of weeping in my arms, desired the truth. I think I wept more for her in the end. She looked on at death as merely a small setback.\n\nAnd she inspired me. She inspired me when my parents died forty years later, and she inspired me when I died sixty years later.\n\nThere was a vast jury of judges looking down upon me. Most of them said I had been good. Some said kissing the dead was not good, but ultimately I had a choice.\n\nClearly, I should have chosen Heaven. I would have been free from my job, would have never had to speak to the dead ever again, and would have lived in complete bliss with my parents, Agrona and Edithe Zilonis.\n\nBut the thought of that was too much for me to bear.\n\nI told those judges, I want to return to Earth, and be an undertaker forever.\n\nI was laughed at, but that hardly mattered, because one day, a twenty-nine-year-old young man came into my shop, dead of course, and his wallet disappeared under my watch.\n\nAn undertaker\u0027s job never ends, and that is fine by me.\n","page 81":"The cermony went on as usual. I guided Edithe Zilonis to her bed. She hesitantly sat down.\n\nShe embraced and kissed me, told me, \"Thank you, Undertaker. You deserve more than some rickety old shop.\"\n\nI said, \"I quite like my rickety old shop. It does its job, and it does it well.\"\n\n\"Except when you have ghost folk wandering around and stealing things,\" Edithe teased.\n\n\"You have me there,\" I admitted. \"Perhaps when you visit again I will be in Central City.\"\n\n\"Oh don\u0027t go there, they cremate folks there.\"\n\nI laughed and Edithe Zilonis smiled at me. She kissed me once more and rested back.\n\n\"You never told me your name,\" she said.\n\n\"That is a shame.\"\n\n\"And how can you speak to the dead anyway?\"\n\n\"I took classes.\"\n\n\"Poppycock.\"\n\n\"Goodnight, Edithe. Have fun, wherever you might be.\"\n\nEdithe Zilonis closed her eyes, and her breath stopped. I put her purse beneath her hands and retired to bed.\n\n~~~\n\nAnd I was in bed and reading the rest of The Dead and Their Deeds when the door to my bedroom creeped open.\n\nI thought, Well that\u0027s odd but not impossible. The building was old and the floors were uneven.\n\nI was on chapter twenty-three, Proper Etiquette and The Dead, when the sheets beside me shuffled. Then, I felt a soft touch on my arm.\n\nI had chills and nearly jumped out of my skin to see Edithe Zilonis beside me.\n\nShe was in a pretty pink gown and stood at the edge of the bed. Her hair was done up and curled back and her skin was far from colorless now.\n\n\"Edithe,\" I called. I had nearly fallen off the bed.\n\n\"Hello, Undertaker. You\u0027re going to be very upset with me,\" she said.\n\nBut her smile was comforting.\n\nSo Edithe Zilonis turned away Heaven, told the folks, I can\u0027t stand how you pray at every meal, and became a ghost.\n\nI scolded her but I truly never minded her. She helped me around the shop, took a great interest in my work. We would go out on the town, her arms tightly around mine, and not once had I been questioned why this woman looked so much like the dead woman from the papers.\n\nI never did retire. I died before I could. Such is the way of cruel, merciless life.\n\nBut it was peculiar, because I was dead for perhaps a day or so when I woke again in my own shop. Except I was in a very different bed. A freezer bed, in fact.\n\nIt was my cousin, who had taken my shop.\n\nShe smiled at me, said, Now you can\u0027t go so soon. Not without telling Edithe where you will be.\n\nIt was not ideal, but I returned to Earth, not to work, not to speak to any more dead, but to live with Edithe Zilonis.\n\nShe said, \"I\u0027m glad you died young. I couldn\u0027t stand kissing an old person.\"\n","page 40":"\"You\u0027re so very silly, wearing your sleeping slacks like that,\" Edithe Zilonis teased.\n\nI kneeled down to observe the blood on the stone.\n\n\"The folks around here already think I\u0027m mad,\" I said, \"and it\u0027s best to let them continue to think that.\"\n\n\"They trust a mad person with their dead?\"\n\nEdithe Zilonis put her hands on her hips, peered over at me.\n\n\"A madman can\u0027t kill what is already dead,\" I said.\n\nEdithe Zilonis laughed.\n\nThe blood was exactly five days old. I had known Edithe Zilonis for four. Dirt and water had since washed it mostly away. A couple stones from the road had been pulled up. Perhaps when the carriage trampled Edithe Zilonis.\n\n\"A coin,\" called Edithe Zilonis. \"It must be mine,\" she joked.\n\nShe found a coin, perhaps one that had come from her purse.\n\n\"You had your purse when you came to me,\" I told her, \"so this man wasn\u0027t after your money.\"\n\n\"But he has my purse now,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, he does. Perhaps he wants us to find it, and ultimately him.\"\n\n\"That\u0027s absurd. He killed me, now he wants us to find him?\" Edithe Zilonis asked.\n","page 42":"\"Did you know any men?\" I asked Edithe Zilonis.\n\n\"Well sure, I know lots of men. Like Willi Cranshaw, Archibold D\u0027oyley, Payton Brandenberger---\"\n\n\"Any man who would push you into a carriage?\" I corrected. \"Who is now dead.\"\n\n\"Fin Seaburg died by jumping off a roof a summer ago. But he was much too kind,\" Edithe Zilonis said.\n\nI began to feel hopeless.\n\n\"Edithe,\" I tried, \"have you had any family at all? Certainly a mother, or a father? Even a sibling or a cousin?\"\n\n\"Well yes, but Mother died when I was five years old. And Father, well he died just a few months ago, but he was mean to me. I hated his guts. I couldn\u0027t wait to get out of that house.\"\n\n\"Edithe,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nShe turned to me fully, had a silly smile on her face as if the man deserved a fate worse than death that she imagined quite often. Her eyes drifted along my chest and my sleeping slacks.\n\n\"Edithe, could it have been your father?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Why would he haunt me? He hated me as much as I loathed him.\"\n\n\"I need to speak to the you who is possessed,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh I don\u0027t like when that happens.

Sometimes a gentleman will desire one last fling before he descends into the firey depths. Sometimes a gentlewoman will want a kiss or two before she vanishes into nothing. Sometimes I have to peel the passionate old folks off of me. But I had never ever initiated anything with any dead. It seemed inappropriate.\n\nBut I had broken one of the few vows I took as an undertaker, and speaker to the dead, and leaned close to Edithe Zilonis and kissed her.\n\nShe seemed surprised as first, but soon her arms were around my neck, pulled me close. She was always soft and sweet.\n\nAnd Edithe Zilonis did not feel dead in the slightest, which at the time gave me reasoning as to why I would ever do such a thing. As far as I knew, she was not yet dead. And as far as I wished, I hoped she would never be.\n\n\"Oh my,\" she spoke between kissing me, \"you are the best undertaker I\u0027ve ever kissed.\"\n\n\"Let me speak to the spirit,\" I ushered.\n","page 52":"The spell read, Loqueris ad me: spiritus.\n\nEdithe Zilonis sat before me, looked at me with a strange face.\n\n\"It did not work,\" she said.\n\n\"Spiritus,\" I tried.\n\nEdithe Zilonis startled me when she slapped the book shut, almost caught my fingers when she did.\n\n\"Obviously this ghostie doesn\u0027t respond all that well to spells, Undertaker. She is probably like me, the unexpected will bring her out,\" Edithe Zilonis said.\n\nWe both sat for a moment, debating on what in the world could bring this spirit out to speak to me.\n\nThankfully, Edithe Zilonis was hardly dead.\n","page 29":"It was not strange that that night I had a dream about Edithe Zilonis.\n\nThe dead haunted my dreams often. Some ghosts continously haunted me until I ceremoniously redirected them to where they desired to be. It was all part of the job. I\u0027m sure most undertakers dealt with their share of the ghost and spirit population as well.\n\nSo I assumed at first Edithe Zilonis was merely in my dreams.\n\nWe had been at the park on Eastend. Edithe Zilonis walked in front of me, would turn back to tease me, and ask if I was still following.\n\nI called back, Yes, Edithe, I am. I\u0027ve followed you for some time now. Why would I not follow you?\n\nI didn\u0027t know the correct answer to that nonsense question.\n\nThe Edithe Zilonis that was in my dreams was much less pale, much less cold, and much less dead. She had color in her cheeks and shoulders. I saw her shoulders because her dress cut low, although it didn\u0027t seem like a thoughtful clothing choice, given it was very cold in this sunny park.\n\nHer blonde hair was done back in soft curls and glittered brightly too, as if it was no longer whitened by death. And she had a bow tied around her head like a girl as well.\n\nHer gown was a brilliant pink with ruffles and shiny fabrics. It was pulled in tightly at the waist, which is a large cause of female organ failure later on. But I did not think about organ failure during this dream. I thought how I rather liked Edithe Zilonis\u0027 waist, how much more I would have liked it without the dress.\n\nI awoke from sleep when the coldness from the sunny park was too much to bear. Edithe Zilonis was standing at the foot of my bed. Her eyes were glowing golden like they had before.\n\n\"Find the man,\" she said to me.\n\n\"Why aren\u0027t you asleep?\" I asked.\n\n\"Find the man,\" she said again, this time with more ferocity. I knew that this part of Edithe Zilonis was not Edithe Zilonis, but I didn\u0027t know who it was.\n\nI was not scared but certainly not content.\n\n\"What man?\" I asked.\n\n\"The man who murdered me,\" she said. \"He has my purse.\"\n\n\"Edithe, you need to sleep,\" I said.\n\n\"I can\u0027t sleep.\"\n","page 22":"The bed I had awokened Edithe Zilonis from was no traditional mattress-ridden bed. It was actually a steel tray with two long cushions upon it. I took pride in the comfort of the dead, as they are bound to return the good deed.\n\nAt least, I assumed. I hadn\u0027t recieved any gift from the dead yet, perhaps because they are dead. But there is always hope.\n\nEdithe Zilonis\u0027 well-kept body was hardly a chore for me. The tray had no trace of blood or other bodily fluids, and her embalming was quite straight-forward. But there also was no purse, as if she snatched it while I was out getting the morning paper.\n\nThe morning paper read, Woman Struck and Killed by Carriage on Main Street, Drunken Driver to Blame?\n\nI thought, well that\u0027s silly, giving out the name of the street. Tourists will be even livelier than usual.\n\nI didn\u0027t realize at the time, but when I awokened Edithe Zilonis, she had thrown her hand onto my cart, knocked my tools askew. A syringe had fallen to the floor. I had frankly not fixed them because I had been slapped.\n\nI also thought, I have never been slapped by a dead woman before, and while the experience had certainly hurt, it thrilled me. Perhaps I was a masochist for the dead.\n","page 66":"I think my reaction time was usually slow, as I spent most of my time in the dark speaking to the dead softly.\n\nOften, I felt dead myself, not because I despised my job, but rather, I had to put myself into the mindset of a dead person in order to properly service him or her.\n\nAnd even when I returned to bed for the night my dreams were sullen too, entwined with the what-if\u0027s of how the dead move on, and how I could better understand them. I was a thinker, not an action-taker, and certainly not a quick action-taker.\n\nBut I was light on my toes. The world around me ceased to move. And as this murderous ghost-man went to shove Edithe back to her death, I had my arms on him.\n\nI had so much momentum I almost lost control of myself. I watched from the ground the carriage trample the man.\n\nThe pink purse fell from his hands, to the ground and landed open. The coins and the perfume bottle within it scattered and shattered at Edithe\u0027s feet.\n\nEdithe gasped. So did I.\n\nThe wheel of the carriage almost caught my fingers.\n","page 21":"I peered closely at the safe. It was an old Herring Safe, at least a century old. I got it cheap when an old barber told me to take it off his hands.

I also met him again a week later but he was half-scorched and dead too.\n\nThe safe was an odd dark red color. However, it was not originally red. The red paint was chipping, revealing the steel beneath it. Why anyone would want to paint a perfectly good safe red of all colors was not something I pondered, especially not at that moment.\n\nThe safe could not be moved by myself. It was as tall as I was and weighed a good bit more than I did too. But I looked at the frame and all about on the inside. The only peculiar thing was that there was a relatively new scratch above the lock, as if someone fumbled to get it open.\n\nI sighed. Perhaps I had been robbed since the morning and the culprit had already left, or was waiting behind me ready to bash my head in, desiring to steal my embalming fluid I supposed.\n\nIt was not often when I was startled. I prefer to think that in all my years of working with the dead, nothing could scare me by then.\n\nBut I absolutely jumped when Edithe Zilonis put her arms on my shoulders and shook me, yelling, \"Boo!\"\n\nShe said, \"I\u0027m like a ghost, see?

Perhaps a wandering dead will find her ring, place it on her hand and leave me to wonder how I had just set it down on the table beside me moments before.\n\nBut disappearance of articles only occurs with objects exceptionally partial to the individual. I was no writer, but I could write that in my own book on the dead whenever I decided to publish one, I believed it so.\n\nPerhaps Edithe Zilonis had taken it when she went upstairs with me. Although how she could have opened the safe was beyond me.\n","page 64":"\"What time is it?\" Edithe asked.\n\nI checked my watch. \"It is almost four,\" I said.\n\nEdithe died at four-o-two.\n\nWe hurried back along the road to find the place of Edithe Zilonis\u0027 death.\n\n\"You have to stand back,\" Edithe told me, \"If he likes shoving people in front of carriages, it is best you stay away.\"\n\n\"Edithe,\" I tried, but she spoke.\n\n\"You are swell at reading and solving mysteries. Now I am going to speak to this man. What is he going to do, kill me again?\"\n\nShe shooed me away with a hand. I stepped back, pressed myself against the building behind me, which was the Vince\u0027s Barber Shop.\n\nThere had been folks walking the streets, and horses and carriages as well, but in the distance a certain horse and carriage barreled down the street, as if the person inside desired to get home very quickly.\n\nAnd a regular man in a dark, dated suit and hat brushed past me. I would not have noticed him if he hadn\u0027t had in his hands a certain, pink purse.\n\nAnd he called, \"Madam, your purse!\"\n\nEdithe turned to look at him.\n\nTime, for a moment, slowed to nearly a stop. I saw myself walking from the far side of the street, a brown bag in my hand, which had been my lunch.\n","page 63":"Annaliese Zilonis died when her husband stabbed her through the chest five times with two different knives from a kitchen set.\n\nEdithe had not been in the house when this occurred, but upon her return, her father had packed most of their things and set off for Central City.\n\nHer father travelled, was not often at home thereafter. Edithe stayed at a home of a Bernice Dacosta, an old woman who seemed to care about Edithe more than her father did.\n\nEdithe said, Bernice adopted me. My father eventually vanished, but I didn\u0027t care. Bernice loved me like my father didn\u0027t.\n\nShe also said, My father returned a decade later, wanting to involve himself in my life again. I told him to shove it up his ass.\n\nI asked, Did no one ever tell you about your mother?\n\nShe said, No. The police must have never found me, or my father. If he is this murderous ghost, then he is avoiding death, and he must be stopped.\n\nShe said, He deserves to rot in the Hells.\n","page 0":"I had finished preparing a lovely young woman who died after being struck by a carriage just outside on Main Street. The ordeal had been surprisingly not gruesome, given her tight corset and big skirts which had protected her soft flesh from the sharp, front corner of the carriage.\n\nShe had, however, been hit head first, knocked unconscious and then ran over by the rear wheels.\n\nThe driver had been upset, had said that the young woman dashed into the road as if she desired to be hit. But no one knew if she desired to die.\n\nI think the driver had gone slightly out of his way.\n\nRegardless, I was not the police, who arrived at the scene some twenty minutes later. And I had not witnessed the event. I was actually coming back from lunch when I saw the police folk outside my shop.\n\nBut I had not necessarily a shop. I was an undertaker. I suppose my shop could be a shop, just for the preparation of the dead and payment thereafter.\n\nPerhaps I rather dealt the dead.\n\nThis young woman was twenty-nine. Her name was Edithe Zilonis, and she had no known relatives.\n\nPolice believed she was from out of town but had searched the local cities for anyone of the same surname. They found absolutely no one. She hadn\u0027t any personal belongings other than a small purse with her name stitched within it, and some coins and a bottle of perfume. It was in the safe and I would set it into her hands when the time for her funeral came.\n\nBut I did not know if this dear Edithe Zilonis would even have a funeral. The carriage driver had come back twice to check on her. Perhaps he would ask for a funeral for her, but that meant he would also have to pay. And the man seemed kind but not too kind.\n\nIt was unfortunate for everyone, because I just cleaned up a corpse and would not be getting paid. I assumed.\n\nSo to soothe my lamenting, I spoke softly to Edithe Zilonis.\n\nWhen I first met her I said to her, \"Hello Miss Zilonis. I\u0027m your undertaker. I hope your stay will be pleasant for you. You are very beautiful, and that is a shame.\"\n\nAnd Edithe Zilonis was very beautiful. She had fair skin and blonde hair. Her eyes were brown had they not been bloodshot, and she had a small frame. She had not had any children, from what I could tell, and very little stress either. Her skin was soft and her dainty little face had no wrinkles or blemishes. It made my heart sink.\n\nPoor girl, I thought, You could have had anyone at your feet, and now you\u0027re dead.\n\nI was curious. I was very curious most of the time. I revelled in the stories of my clients. I loved hearing what families had to say about their sweet Leola, or handsome Damon. How Tessy was such an affectionate grandmother, and how Alford had been taken from us much too young, Gods bless him.\n\nI loved these stories because most of them were just stories.\n\nI allowed the families and friends and lovers to relish in their pleasantries, but I knew the truth. I knew the dead far more intimately than the living.\n"}
