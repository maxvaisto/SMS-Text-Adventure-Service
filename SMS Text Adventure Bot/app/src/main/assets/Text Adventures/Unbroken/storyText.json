  "page 123": "“As you wish, my Emperor,” you say. “We’ll depart right away.”\n\n“Excellent. I’ll instruct my men to meet you at first light,” the Emperor replies, turning to leave.\n\n“With respect, I don’t think you understood me,” you say. “When I say depart right away, I mean now. There is only a short window while corpses still look like themselves.”\n\n“I understand, my friend. I have important matters to attend here, otherwise I’d go with you. I’ll make the arrangements.”\n\nYou wade through the puddle of blood to Kassi’s corpse. Her lifeless eyes stare, endlessly, towards the octopus-shaped chandelier above. Softly, you shut them closed and scoop her underneath your arms. You silently mourn the loss of Mordecai. He was your enemy, a damned tough one, but more importantly, he came from the monastery. In another life perhaps you would have been close. You shake the thought from your mind as quickly as it appears. There’s no use in dwelling on the past. The past is dead. All that matters is the present moment.\n\nYou arrive at the front gates of Aeric’s castle still holding Kassi. The path is littered with fallen soldiers, their victors fighting over treasures of the dead. It’s not uncommon for fights to break out over bounty, at least among the lower ranked members.\n\n“I see some things remain the same.”\n\nThe ragged voice comes from above you. You look up to see a man bound to the archway almost directly on top of you. His arms are held out like a “T” wrapped and suspended by rope. The remainder of his naked body is exposed for all to see. At his belly, three arrows. You count the broken shafts of four more scattered in his body. He coughs, creating a crimson waterfall down the front of his bare torso. After a moment, you recognize his face. He’s hardly aged since last you saw him. Seth.\n\n“Who did this?” you scream to the nearby Imperial soldiers. One of them offers a shrug, the rest simply pretend not to hear. You stomp towards the one who shrugged, who is likely regretting the gesture. “I won’t ask again.\"\n\nThe man nervously avoids your direct gaze. At first it’s unfocused, but then it becomes fixed, targeted at someone. You turn to see a pair of horns mounted on a helm, black armor beneath. A dull, monotone voice speaks through the helm.\n\n“I did.”\n\nYou let the nervous soldier leave. He takes off quickly, not looking back once.\n\n“I know who you are -- and what you did,” you state.\n\n“Dresden, at your command. People die in war,” the voice beneath the helm answers.\n\n“Like that?” you point up towards Seth.\n\n“All kinds of ways.”\n\nSeth coughs again, distracting you from the conversation. “Pay her my respects, will you, kid?”\n\nYou nod, a reply absent from your lips. Turning towards the horned helm you ask knowing the answer, “And I suppose you are to accompany me?”\n\n“That is correct, Commander. No one knows these mountains like I do.”\n\nYou depart for the monastery ruins along with Dresden. The image of Seth bound, and slowly dying, burns in your memory. Several times during the journey, you notice the reigns to the cart unconsciously wrapped around your hands in a bind. You lead the battalion from the head, Dresden follows overhead by wyvern. You don’t turn to look upon the coffin at the back of your cart. You want to, but don’t, and keep your eyes forward on the path, hoping your physical metaphor will transition to the non-physical. You don’t speak to the Imperial soldiers. Not that you really ever did, but this journey more than others you desire silence.\n\nNow that you’re here, in this moment, were your actions worth it? Your training, your discipline deters such thought, and yet, you brute force through the mental barriers and habits accrued over a lifetime of practicing. Your oldest friend is dead, and the thing that originally separated you, was the exact cause of her death.\n\nPerhaps, events are prewritten. Perhaps, you cannot escape destiny. A shiver runs down your spine as you connect with the thought that your destiny is intertwined with murdering your loved ones. No, there has to be more at work. Call it coincidence, bad luck, whatever -- anything that’s not a pre-arranged set of circumstances. You are in control of your fate, of your destiny. You have to believe that’s the case.\n\nThree days later you arrive. At first a black dot in the distance, the ruins slowly begin to take shape as you draw closer. The monastery had certainly seen better days. While the place is mostly intact, signs of decay can be seen, even from afar. It’s as if the nature surrounding the structure is steadily swallowing the monastery from the lack of upkeep. Still, decades later, you don’t see any sign of bandits or people taking shelter within the place, a testament to the monastery’s reputation.\n\nPart of you wants to order the Imperial troops to camp outside. Their presence near the monastery is bad enough, and what are you supposed to do? Welcome the same invading force to take refuge in the sacred place of your childhood? Such thoughts are born of attachment. The monks taught against such behavior. You don’t like it, but you allow the Imperial soldiers to use the shelter that the monastery provides.\n\nAlone, you take Kassi to a nearby mountainside, the same place where the Grand Melee took place. You travel up the rocky slope to the section where the mountain jettisons out, flat, as if cleanly cut. You briefly admire the view from the high vantage point and begin collecting rocks. The view is exactly as you remember it. Your life is drastically different decades later, while the world in front of you remains the same. Once you’ve gathered enough, you place them in a pile where the lifted stage once stood. You gently lay Kassi in the center and begin building the stone grave.\n\n“Was everything in vain?” you softly speak to Kassi. “Was this moment truly unavoidable?”\n\nShe remains silent.\n\n“I contemplate each action before deciding, weighing each potential outcome against another. We were taught to accept our position, no matter what. We were taught to let go of any attachments as our selves, our true selves, are not dependent on things or people. You were always much better than me.”\n\nThe grave complete, you take a step back and kneel before the rocks, your hips on your heels and hands in your lap. Your eyes flutter shut and you take long, drawn-out breaths. Each inhale, you feel your stomach, ribs, and chest expand, followed by the retraction of exhalation. The rocky ground digs into your knees, creating a dull pain. Ignoring it, you continue to meditate observing the thought stream that flows in your mind.\n\nThe wind softly blows, drawing your awareness to the world around you. The breeze whispers at your nape, promising to remain consistent. She’s chaotic, seemingly random at times, but steady and steadfast to her word, much like Kassi.\n\nA bird flies overhead, wings outstretched using the wind for guidance. It does not weigh its actions; it follows its instinct. No ideology or self-story holds it down. It simply exists. Kassi to rest, you journey back down the mountainside.\n\nTheir drunken cries ring into the night air, animalistic, more than the woodland creatures you just crossed paths with. The ruins, lit by bonfires built from monastery remains, warm and encourage the primal behavior. You stop at the nearest fire, staring at the six soldiers huddled around.\n\n“Commander! We discovered a sizeable amount of mead in the cellar. Join us in celebrating the Emperor’s victory.”\n\nThe young-faced soldier offering the invitation holds a cup out for you. Not much more than a boy, it’s not surprising the mead is affecting him so.\n",
  "page 122": "Red. Your entire vision is filled with red. A driving, insatiable force drives you forward. You can’t stop, nor do you want to. The weak, the undevoted, the blasphemers. They all will pay for their wrong. Like separating wheat from the chaff, you will forge a better society, one that is not unencumbered by the weak-willed and naysayers.\n\nEach cleansing blow from your sword brings you one step closer. Each foreigner that falls brings a surge of energy and a curved smile to your lips. Your blade eats into flesh and drinks the flowing blood. “More!” it screams, and you satisfy its desire. You do not see faces, you do not hear their words. You simply kill. You kill for the Empire. You kill to cull the weak. You kill because it’s all that you know.\n\nThe bloodlust gone, the voice gives back control, and you see the result of your actions. You’re in the center of a red pool, your hands stained the same. The blood is warm, like clutching a soothing cup of tea between both palms.\n\nThen you see her.\n\nShe lays still as if asleep, one arm crossed at her chest, the other stretched out beside her body. Her bright blonde hair, the color that reminds you of sunlight, is dyed dark crimson. The two slashes at her throat are like a jagged, sanguine necklace. The others, Mordecai, Sue, Wren, lay next to her. You hardly notice them; your gaze is on Kassi, unmoving, unable to look away.\n\nYour stoic, expressionless demeanor vanishes as your screams fill the empty throne room. Just as suddenly as it disappeared, you regather your blank, emotionless demeanor. You close your eyes and focus on your training, using long, drawn-out breathing patterns to calm your heart rate. When you reopen your eyes, the Emperor stands before you.\n\n“A great victory has been won this day,” he comments.\n\n“What of the cure?” you ask. “Have you uncovered the secrets to suppressing the voice?”\n\nThe Emperor eyes the mess of bodies on the floor. “Not yet, I’m afraid. The collection of books here are not nearly as extensive as my spies informed. Still, I will have my top researchers work on it. There is one ritual that might work, but it involves giving in to the voice…”\n\n“Not going to happen. I’ve been controlled by it for too long. I’ll not willingly surrender to it, even at the slight chance of eradicating it forever.”\n\n“I thought you’d say that,” The Emperor says. “We’ll find a way. I’ve had my men prepare a room for you here. Come, rest up. Tomorrow brings the promise of greater glories.”\n\nThe Emperor motions to a man standing near the entryway. With a bow, he approaches.\n\n“Follow me, Commander. I’ll show you your quarters,” the youthful man speaks. You can tell by his clean appearance, he did not take part in the battle.\n\n“No,” you say. “I need to bury her. I need to bury Kassi near the monastery.”\n\n“I understand,” The Emperor replies. “I will arrange a battalion to accompany.”\n\n“With respect, that would dishonor her memory. She fought the Empire to her last breath,” you say with full clarity of the statement. While you are technically a part of the Empire, an Imperial force near the monastery would be symbolic of the initial attack, something you’d rather not think about while putting Kassi to rest.\n\n“I’ll not allow a high-ranking member of my army travel alone, especially in newly conquered territory. The threat is too high. You will go with a battalion or not at all,” The Emperor adamantly states.\n",
  "page 125": "They arrived sooner than you expected. At first they appeared as birds flying in the distance. Black wings steadily gaining on your location, and that’s when you recognize the “birds.” Wyverns, three of them. Your traveling conditions offered almost no ability to conceal your path. It wasn’t hard for them to find you — it’s their hastiness that surprised you.\n\nTwo of the winged beasts land at your front and one directly behind you. The trail is narrow, leaving almost no room for you to veer off to avoid their pursuit. Thick trees lie of either side, preventing the cart from being able to travel through. The first thing you notice is the horned helm. Sending flashbacks to your childhood, the day of the massacre, you instantly recognize the figure. The greatsword at his back, the one that stole the life of the Grandmaster hangs at the figure’s back. Beneath the helm is a dark set of plate armor.\n\n“The Emperor had a feeling you might betray him,” the voice behind the horns rings into the cool morning air.\n\n“There is no betrayal, only what must be done. A woman lies dead and must be buried,” you say.\n\n“That’s not what I heard,” the dull, monotone voice answers. “Is that what you heard, Larkus?”\n\nThe rider next to the horned helm shakes his head. “Not what I heard at all, Dresden.”\n\n“Be on your way. I will rejoin the Emperor after a proper burial has taken place,” you say. “Your intentions are no secret. The way you’ve positioned yourselves speak to only one outcome. Battle.”\n\n“Newly conquered territories always are dangerous. There’s no telling how the locals might react. Like, for say, they might set upon a lone Imperial member. It’s dangerous to be alone, even for a well renown warrior such as yourself.”\n\nYour hands let go of the reigns and their grip is replaced with sword handles. “Then let us not delay. I have a funeral to attend to. Seems I’ll need to attend to yours first.”\n\nWith a snarl, the horned man, Dresden, attacks. His greatsword swings through the air with a low hum. The other two riders follow closely behind, their spears at the ready. You abandon the cart for open ground. The first wyvern dives down with frightening speed. It’s only through your lifetime training that you’re able to narrowly dodge the attack. A little luck never hurts too. You realize in the open, you’re too exposed, and likely would be run down in a matter of time. Once again moving ground, you trade the open road for the surrounding forest neutralizing their aerial assault. Three men follow you into the thicket.\n\nLight is minimal in the forest. Overgrown branches, roots, and stumps fill your vision. It’s hard to navigate through, even in your light armor. Going through with heavy plate would be a nightmare. You allow the environment to influence your battle plans, familiarizing yourself with the area. Long lunging and high overhead sweeping techniques would have to be discarded due to the overgrowth.\n\nHeavy footsteps draw closer. You lie in wait. They don’t see you, not at first. In the open road you were their prey. Here you are the predator. Here, you will hunt them down. The first spear wielder doesn’t even have time to react. From behind, you silently sneak up. Kassi’s blade finds the front of his throat, the slight gap in armor where the helm doesn’t quite reach the breastplate. His body collapses in the clanking of armor, alerting the other two.\n\nThrough the thicket you see the twin horns heading in your direction. Quickly, you move to find cover. His plate boots stomp heavily on the forest floor. You wait until the sound reaches its highest point to strike. As if from the crow’s nest, you swing down, one hand gripping a vine, the other around Kassi’s hilt. The powerful strike, backed by the swinging momentum is difficult to land. You have adjust mid-swing to find the gap between armor. The blow sends both of you sprawling to the dirt, the horned helm knocked from Dresden’s head.\n\nYou almost don’t recognize the man. Despite being decades ago, the youthful appearance of Dresden is replaced by a scarred, hairless face as if he suffered a terrible burn years ago. The scars extend down his neck disappearing into the black plate.\n\nImmediately, you land in a front roll and prepare for the next series of strikes. The helm missing, you have more exposed area to work with. Dresden knows it as well and keeps his greatsword high to block your upward-aimed advance. You’re careful not to focus solely on one target, and mix in quick thrusts and a slices towards the plated body of Dresden. The strikes may bounce harmlessly off the armor, but the distraction non-linear approach is what you’re aiming for.\n\nYou unleash a barrage of well-executed strikes, sweeping low then high, weaving both blades through the air always moving forward, always setting up the next maneveour. When one blow is absorbed, you use the other sword to strike an undefended area. No defense is perfect. Eventually there’s always an opening. You’re alert, coiled like a serpent searching for exposed flesh where you will inject your deadly fangs. The opening is there, and you take full advantage.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, pain rips through the side of your body. You look down to find a spearpoint sticking through the left side of your torso. The third rider, Larkus, stands over you with both hands clutching his spear. He rips the weapon back, tearing the point through the initial wound. A cry escapes your lips as you collapse in front of the fallen Dresden. Kassi’s sword falls to the dirt and you use the open palm to cover the bleeding. Seeing you drop, Larkus rushes to Dresden’s side. He cradles the man’s head in his arms and attempts to treat the wound at his neck.\n\nYou try to stand up. The most you can manage is placing one knee beneath you. Pain surges from your side. It’s like grabbing a hot plate, except you can’t let go. Larkus notices, and abandons his medical care of Dresden.\n\n“You deserve all of this and more,” he says.\n\n“For what? Burying my oldest friend?” you answer.\n\n“Yes. The only loyalty you should have is for the Emperor.”\n\nHe approaches, spearpoint at the ready. Here, in your last moments, you don’t feel the sense of regret most others would have. Death is not something new to you. For many years you’ve accepted that fact. It’s truly the only certainty in life. You don’t even regret siding with the Empire, the same Empire that’s about to end your life. Everything’s numb. Nothing really matters. The inevitable end has arrived and the gap between your birth and death is but memories soon to be dissolved with your last breath.\n\n“I’m ready,” you state more to yourself than Larkus.\n\nYour vision blurs, then becomes blackness.\n",
  "page 124": "“As you wish, my Emperor,” you say. “We’ll depart at first light.”\n\nThe statement feels strange. It’s the first time you’ve ever intentionally misled the Emperor. In fact, it’s the first time you’ve intentionally misled anyone for years. You take pride in your practice, and that practice includes being direct and forthright. Still, this is a special circumstance. Even considering it “special” puts a damper on your mood. It’s not special, your fucking world is turned upside down.\n\nYou allow an Imperial soldier to lead to you the quarters provided. It’s not as extravagant as the Emperor’s tent, but it serves its purpose. It wouldn’t be your place to dwell in a living arrangement that’s nicer than your leader\u0027s anyway. The room itself is long and narrow. The ceiling is arced like a cabin would be, two sloping walls meeting at the center. Earth tones line the interior, nothing is fancy, but serves its purpose to the highest degree.\n\nYou drop your things near the heavy wool-skinned bed and kneel on the floor beside it. Sitting on your heels, you close your eyes and meditate on your upcoming actions. The Emperor wouldn’t be happy. Perhaps he would understand. You doubt it. Disobeying is disobeying, despite your place in the Empire. Once the light shining through the window fades to black, you prepare for the journey.\n\nYou pack light, taking only what is necessary. Without the aid of Imperial transport, you’ll need as little as possible weighing you down. Your sword is hung, familiar, on your hip. On it’s opposite, you hang Kassi’s sword. Two swords at your side, something you’ve never preferred, feels right in this moment. The blade was an important part of Kassi, her most prized possession. Having it at your side is a good reminder of your reasons for going against the Emperor. It’s almost like having her at your side. Almost.\n\nThe horse and cart is already prepared for the journey. You made sure to have it prepared the night before. A lone Imperial soldier stands guard at the stables, light for an Imperial patrol, but the rest of the “on duty” guards are most likely celebrating the victory.\n\n“Evening, Commander. Thought that was you. What can I do for you?” the baby-faced soldier speaks in to the night.\n\n“It’s Ostus, right?” you ask.\n\n“That’s right!” he beams. Adding on with a salute, he says, “Fredrick Ostus at your command.”\n\n“You’re a good soldier, Ostus. But you are needed elsewhere tonight. There are more high priority places to watch,” you say.\n\n“Maybe so…although Dresden himself gave me this position. I can’t disobey a superior, even if there is something better to do. It’s how we stay functioning,” Ostus shrugs. “Trust me, I’d rather be at with the boys celebrating. Don’t tell Dresden that, but my job is to watch the stables and prevent any disorderly conduct.”\n\n“You’re a good man, Ostus. I hope when you wake, you’ll forgive me.”\n\n“Forgive you for wh--\"\n\nBefore Ostus finishes his sentence, the hilt of your sword smashes against his temple. His body crumples limply to the ground. You prop his body in a comfortable position, and take the reigns of the cart. It’s a small cart, only driven by a single horse, but it’s more than enough to lug the contents in the back. You signal the horse forward and ride off into the night.\n",
  "page 126": "Two bright eyes stare intently at you. Instinctively, you sit up in the bed only to rediscover the pain at your side. You’re in a small hut. Soft embers burn in the center of the room, rising through a gap in the rooftop. The eyes belong to a young girl, not much past ten years.\n\n“Rose. Go fetch our guest some tea,” a man’s voice rings from the doorway. The outside light, illuminating his frame, leaves his face mostly dark, although you see signs of a thick moustache. He approaches the bed, rolling the sleeves of his woodland-colored tunic up his arms, revealing sturdy forearms that are likely the result of years of workmanship. He sets a bow and quiver down next to the bed post. The bow may be of simple design, although the craft and quality of the wood are the finest you’ve ever seen -- and the Empire spares no expense when it comes to war equipment.\n\n“You have no love for the Empire,” the man speaks, partly questioning.\n\n“In fairness, it has no love for me,” you speak truthfully, carefully. You’re uncertain if Dresden chased you down by direct command of the Emperor. He didn’t strike you as someone who acted rogue. Then again, no one expected that of you.\n\n“Why were those men after you? It’s not often for a wyvern triad to chase down a single cart.” The man’s eyes narrow, seeking signs of deception in yours.\n\nThe cart! Kassi.\n\n“I must be on my way,” you answer. “In the back of the cart, I was transporting the remains of my…”\n\nThe words escape you. What was Kassi to you? “Friend” wouldn’t do her justice. It wouldn’t be an accurate description of the decades you spent joined at the hip. It wouldn’t be telling of the fact that you knew everything about one another, your tendencies, what got under your skin. It wouldn’t speak of the countless near-death experiences you shared, up until the moment your hands finished the tally. Your lover? You loved her, and she you. Still, your bond was deeper than the bodily connotation attached with that word. You find yourself at a loss for words. There is not a single word that would accurately describe your relationship with Kassi.\n\n“Wife.”\n\nClose enough. That will have to do. The man finishes the sentence for you. He continues. “Brought your horse and cart out back. This is as good a place as any to bury a wife.”\n\nRose comes back with two cups. She hands one to you and one to her father. She looks up, expectantly, for you to take a sip. After thanking her, you raise the cup to your lips. Cool mint washes against your tongue like a fresh breath of air. The warm liquid instantly soothes and compliments the herbal flavor. Your hands fill with the warmth of the cup, comfortably drawing your attention away from the pain at your side.\n\n“The tea helps. I can speak from experience,” the man says, lifting his shirt to reveal a sizable scar along the front of his mid-section. “My reward in service of ‘King’ Aeric. I have no love for the man, but I’d rather see him on the throne than some Imperial puppet.”\n\n“Aeric is dead. You’re now a part of the newest territory under the Empire’s rule,” you answer. “Thank you for saving my life. I really must be on my way. I need to put Kassi to rest.”\n\nYou attempt to rise from the bed, but the wound proves stronger. The combination of the blood loss and relaxing effects of the tea gently sooth you back to sleep. You slip in and out of consciousness for a few seconds, willing yourself to take back control. A pair of bright eyes watch your head fall to the pillow, peering from behind the sturdy frame of her father.\n\n...\n\nYou stand at her grave, one hand on her blade and the other at your cane. Your spear wound is mostly healed, though it still gives you problems. The walking cane, carved by Richard, helps with the sudden jolts of pain. Using the cane as support, you kneel into the dirt and place your palm on the simple tombstone.\n\n“Was this truly unavoidable, Kass?” you whisper. “You know I only left you to confront the darkness within me, to protect you from it. Perhaps I was always meant to end your life, destined even. By the same coin, no one knows how long they are destined to live. Our joined strength may have well extended both of our lives -- there’s no way of knowing if this life, if both our lives, were tragedy or otherwise.”\n\nThe grave remains silent. You sense a pair of bright eyes watching you from behind a nearby tree.\n\n“Either draw near or don’t. There’s no use in second guessing yourself, girl,” you speak.\n\nShyly, she leaves the protection of the tree and kneels down next to you.\n\n“What’s your name girl?” you ask.\n\n“Rose.”\n\n“Well, Rose. You remind me of brave warrior I once knew. Would you like to hear about her?”\n\nRose nods, her eyes shimmering aquamarine.\n\n“I knew her when we were about your age. Can you believe someone old like me was once young? Strange is the flow of time. In moments it feels as if a pond, still and unmoving. Other times it’s a flowing river, with treacherous rapids to navigate. This warrior, Kassi, was truly special. She taught me almost everything I know, while being only a few years older than me. It was a great burden she bore for my sake, having to deal with my undisciplined self and not let it discourage her own progress. I was saw her fight off ten men with nothing more than a small dagger. That’s the mark of a true warrior, always finding the path to victory, always willing to do whatever it takes.”\n\n“You were in love?” Rose asks.\n\n“I loved her more than myself -- that’s why I left her. Listen, Rose, love is tricky sometimes. You’ll find that out in a few years. Sometimes it’s in the best interest of the other person if you’re not around them.”\n\nYou grab a handful of dirt from the burial mound and feel it slip through your fingers, feeling the soft tingle as it passes through. Your fingers and palm are left empty save for a small stain. “It’s like this soil. I could clutch onto it tightly, protecting it from outside forces, but that would be detrimental to its purpose. No, better for it to be on the ground, at the risk of being trampled or washed away by rain. It’s the only way for growth to happen.”\n\nLeaning on the cane, you place your shins on the ground, sitting on your heels. You motion for Rose to do the same. She follows your example, and looks up, expectantly with bright blue eyes. You place your hands on your lap and take a deep breath, filling your lungs with the air around you, with the final resting place of Kassi.\n\nThe soft breeze whistles leaves into motion. The earthy smell from the dirt is still in the air, and you draw it in, putting the aroma to memory. You do as she taught you many years ago. You’re uncertain of what your future has in store for you, but you will continue to practice. You will continue to honor her memory.\n\n“Want me to teach you to become like the brave warrior?” you ask.\n\nRose nods.\n",
  "page 129": "It’s not out of hate. You don’t harbor ill-will towards the Imperial soldiers -- they’re on your side, after all. It’s a matter of respect and discipline to the highest degree, both of which the soldiers lack. Just as the bird flying overhead, you do not contemplate. You simply do as you must, what you’re born, what you’re destined to do.\n\nKassi’s sword has a familiar feel, as if the two of you are clasping hands. You offer her memory a funeral of Imperial blood. Before the drunken soldiers can react, you arc Kassi’s blade through the air, showering the earth with blood and mead. The drink slows them down, pitifully so. The few that manage to unsheathe their weapons are met with your tribute to Kassi. Parry, feint, strike! You knew Kassi’s movements almost as well as the woman herself and channel her fighting spirit to guide your blade.\n\nShouts echo from other fires as the soldiers notice your actions. An alarm bell rings, signaling the Imperial soldiers into mobilization. The flames at your back, you eye the soldier’s preparation. They’re undisciplined, unprepared. You stand a dark figure framed by the fire, a sword in either hand. Two blades have never been your style, but tonight the union between Kassi’s and your sword would be complete, sealed by the death of Empire soldiers. You do what you could not forty years earlier. You smite the invading army from the monastery.\n\nDresden appears in simple chain mail, his normal plate armor too bulky to don for the sudden attack. You almost don’t recognize the man, besides the greatsword at his back. His face is scarred as if a burn victim, hairless save for two thin eyebrows.\n\n“It seems the Emperor’s dog isn’t as well-trained as we were meant to believe. No matter, I have strict orders to put you down if this place brought out old habits,” he speaks, unmuffled by the absence of his normal helm.\n\n“Do what you must. It’s the only thing a man can do,” you reply.\n\nDresden’s greatsword swings through the air, the weight sending off low-pitched tones. You redirect the greatsword, not wanting to directly block the blows. The powerful weapon would easily eat through your arm strength if met head-on. You allow your training to guide you. The flow takes over and the world slows down around you. Each swing of the greatsword appears labored as if the wielder is out of breath. Things appear with clarity. The present moment, all that matters, is before you. Plans of the future, past failures: they don’t matter. Your entire reality becomes the current battle.\n\nYour sword finds the back of Dresden’s hamstring, dropping him to one knee. For emphasis, you slice open the other. He kneels before you, using the greatsword to prop himself up.\n\n“End it, dog. You cannot escape the Empire’s grasp. Soon you will join me in the afterlife. The Emperor will make sure of that,” Dresden speaks through ragged breath.\n\n“Perhaps so. Whatever fate has in store for me is irrefutable, whether that’s my death or otherwise. One thing’s for certain, your journey ends here,” you answer.\n\nThe tip of Kassi’s sword enters through the front and exits the back of Dresden’s throat. The strength gone from his limbs, Dresden falls forward and collapses face first into the dirt. Chained in the distance, Dresden’s wyvern cries out. The beast roars over the battle-readying Imperial troops.\n\nYou approach the beast, eyeing the chain at its neck tied to a tree trunk. It returns the stare with yellow lizard eyes, sensing your intention and threat presence. Using Dresden’s greatsword you break the chain holding the wyvern in place. Instantly, it flaps its wings and jumps into the air. Now free, it heads in the direction of the surrounding mountains. You do the same.\n",

The drink slows them down, pitifully so. The few that manage to unsheathe their weapons are met with your tribute to Kassi. Parry, feint, strike! You knew Kassi’s movements almost as well as the woman herself and channel her fighting spirit to guide your blade.\n\nShouts echo from other fires as the soldiers notice your actions. An alarm bell rings, signaling the Imperial soldiers into mobilization. The flames at your back, you eye the soldier’s preparation. They’re undisciplined, unprepared. You stand a dark figure framed by the fire, a sword in either hand. Two blades have never been your style, but tonight the union between Kassi’s and your sword would be complete, sealed by the death of Empire soldiers. You do what you could not forty years earlier. You smite the invading army from the monastery.\n\nDresden appears in simple chain mail, his normal plate armor too bulky to don for the sudden attack. You almost don’t recognize the man, besides the greatsword at his back. His face is scarred as if a burn victim, hairless save for two thin eyebrows.\n\n“It seems the Emperor’s dog isn’t as well-trained as we were meant to believe. No matter, I have strict orders to put you down if this place brought out old habits,” he speaks, unmuffled by the absence of his normal helm.\n\n“Do what you must. It’s the only thing a man can do,” you reply.\n\nDresden’s greatsword swings through the air, the weight sending off low-pitched tones. You redirect the greatsword, not wanting to directly block the blows. The powerful weapon would easily eat through your arm strength if met head-on. You allow your training to guide you. The flow takes over and the world slows down around you. Each swing of the greatsword appears labored as if the wielder is out of breath. Things appear with clarity. The present moment, all that matters, is before you. Plans of the future, past failures: they don’t matter. Your entire reality becomes the current battle.\n\nYour sword finds the back of Dresden’s hamstring, dropping him to one knee. For emphasis, you slice open the other. He kneels before you, using the greatsword to prop himself up.\n\n“End it, dog. You cannot escape the Empire’s grasp. Soon you will join me in the afterlife. The Emperor will make sure of that,” Dresden speaks through ragged breath.\n\n“Perhaps so. Whatever fate has in store for me is irrefutable, whether that’s my death or otherwise. One thing’s for certain, your journey ends here,” you answer.\n\nThe tip of Kassi’s sword enters through the front and exits the back of Dresden’s throat. The strength gone from his limbs, Dresden falls forward and collapses face first into the dirt. Chained in the distance, Dresden’s wyvern cries out. The beast roars over the battle-readying Imperial troops.\n\nYou approach the beast, eyeing the chain at its neck tied to a tree trunk. It returns the stare with yellow lizard eyes, sensing your intention and threat presence. Using Dresden’s greatsword you break the chain holding the wyvern in place. Instantly, it flaps its wings and jumps into the air. Now free, it heads in the direction of the surrounding mountains. You do the same.\n",
  "page 77": "Wanting to finish the show quickly, you wait for Priscilla’s next attack. As performs the cut, you catch hold of her sword hand mid-swing. You use her momentum to throw her body to the ground. The crowd gasps at the sudden change in tactics. The guard assigned to Priscilla, steps into the center with his sword out. At the last moment, you shoot your leg out and squat to ground level. Priscilla lands harmlessly in your grasp, your hand supporting her upper body and your leg, the lower. She sits, unmoving, as her mind tries to understand how she ended up in that position.\n\nA big smile stretches across her face. “I told you he was the best!” she shouts to the crowd. Her guard relaxes his sword. You help Priscilla to her feet and bow to the crowd. Several members pat you on the back as you rejoin Kassi in the sea of onlookers.\n\n“The way you played with her reminded me of our early years,” she says.\n\n“We’ve certainly come a long way since then. Look at us, all dressed up and attending the most exclusive party in the Empire. I did not imagine our future would look this way,” you say.\n\n“Just remember why we’re here,” she answers.\n\n“My mind is focused,” you reply.\n\n“Ahem.”\n\nYou turn to see a dignitary with two elite guards at either side. His long flowing green hair and smoothly-shaved skin gives a youthful appearance, yet his eyes look more mature. The guards at either side stand stoic, their polaxes at the ready.\n\n“Yes? Can I help you?” you ask.\n\n“The Emperor summons you for a personal audience,” the man says with an air of superiority.\n\n“The Emperor? What does he want with me?” you ask. You’re not used to being caught off guard, and the man’s statement is not expected.\n\n“I am not here to answer your questions. Only to bring to His Majesty. Come along now. Alone.”\n\nYou give Kassi a shrug and follow behind the green-haired man. The guards “subtly” arrange themselves to your front and back. The man leads you up a massive, winding staircase of red carpet. Gold lines the banisters. You continue down a narrow hallway, stopping at four different checkpoints for clearance. The man keeps the same posture throughout: shoulders back and chin high. The personnel at the checkpoints seem to recognize the man, but still thoroughly search him the same as you. Your cane is confiscated at the first point. You reach a series of steel double-doors and the man motions for you to enter. The green-haired man and guards stay outside.\n\nYou enter the room and take in your surroundings. It\u0027s mostly open-spaced, though on the narrow side. Two balconies run on either side, and you can see a series of bookcases on the floor above. White marble fills the ground. At the far end, you can see a spherical object on what appears to be a shrine. Behind it, a small staircase on either side lead to a viewing platform. You can’t see out the windows from your position, but you can guess the half-circle of clear glass gives a view over the entire capital. A figure stands at the viewing platform gazing out, his back turned towards you.\n\nThe room is silent, but for your echoing footsteps as you approach the platform.\n\n“Do you know why you’re here, Swordmaster?” the figure says. His voice is deep, though not in an aggressive manner.\n\n“I’m here at the invitation of my Emperor,” you reply.\n\n“And you do not have an ulterior motive?”\n\nFor the second time tonight, you’re caught off-guard. “I do admit, attending tonight is beneficial to my school, not everyone can be taught the art of swordplay from a master in favorable grace with His Majesty.”\n\n“No,” the Emperor says. He turns around and you catch sight of him for the first time. Long strands of black hair hang well below his shoulders. His eyes are green, something you’ve never seen with an individual with black hair. His face is sharp as if his attention is kept unwavering on the object of his choosing. You imagined the Emperor to be old, though he looks just a few years older than you.\n\n“You’re here to kill me,” he finishes the statement.\n",
  "page 76": "“Do not deny it. My spies are everywhere, even in the sanctuary of your inner circle,” the Emperor states. He slowly steps down the left side of the arched staircase and continues. “It’s a suicide mission, I’m afraid. In a few moments, your friend -- oh what’s the name she’s going by now...Mathers. Mathers will be taken into custody along with any accomplices, including your precious wife.”\n\nThe man speaks with utter conviction. You can tell the difference between a bluff in an attempt to gather information and a man speaking the truth. You deal with it routinely in swordplay; there’s always a slight sign of a man feinting. It may be subtle, but it’s there and you’ve trained your whole life to spot it. There’s no mistaking it, the Emperor knows about the assassination attempt.\n\n“Then why are we still alive?” you ask. “The obvious action would be to execute us, publically, to dissuade future attempts.”\n\n“All that can be arranged later. I’m more interested in the man who survived the monastery...and more importantly, the child who survived the shade.”\n\n“You’d have plenty of witnesses if you didn’t order them all killed,” you retort.\n\n“Yes,” the Emperor mulls. “It’s a shame those barbarians allowed bloodlust to take over. Their orders were to capture Aeric’s throne. Instead, they rampaged throughout the land, slaughtering all in their way. I had to order a battalion of my own to put them down. I’m sure you find comfort in knowing the monastery’s attackers were all executed. Not quickly, I might add.”\n\n“They’re all your own. The way I see it, you ordered the attack. The monks were peaceful. They did nothing to deserve the attack.”\n\n“Ahh, spoken like a true devotee. It’s no secret the monks in the mountains bred the finest warriors in the territory. Tell me, Swordmaster, who protected the monastery?”\n\n“Aeric was supposed to.”\n\n“And what did Aeric receive in return?”\n\nSuddenly, it’s clear. The monks provided their finest warrior to Aeric each year after the Grand Melee. The monks were actively providing King Aeric with elite soldiers. In other words, they were supplying a nation in opposition to the Empire with troops.\n\n“I’ll take your silence as agreement,” the Emperor says. “The monks were in opposition to the Empire. I’m not justifying the action of those animals, but I’m simply stating true neutrality is a false ideal. You’re either an ally or enemy, which brings me to you. I know what hunts you. I know the nightmares you’ve been having. I can help you if you merely align yourself to me.”\n\nYou feel a familiar shiver down your spine.\n\n“What do you know of the nightmares?” you ask.\n\n“I know of your past and the great power that lies within. A descendent of divine blood mixed with the hellspawn of the Unbroken. I also know of the unrelenting curse that follows. I know because I am the same. We are brothers, you and I. Give up your futile vendetta against the Empire and let’s raise the curse that follows our family.”\n\nSuddenly, the double-doors swing open, and a blood-stained Mathers enters the room. The white on her waitress outfit is turned red. Followed behind her is the green-haired man and Kassi, both armed and just as stained. The trio walks up next to you and faces the Emperor leaving behind a trail of red footprints.\n\n“Thank you, Swordmaster, for distracting the Emperor’s watchful gaze long enough,” Mathers says. “I don’t think we would have made it through without. Heh, seems you overestimated whose inner circle was compromised.”\n\n“You’ll not survive this night. And you, Saric,” the Emperor addresses the green haired man. “Treason is punishable by death.”\n\nThe Emperor jumps past you, summoning a sword in either hand. He engages the trio with a flurry of strikes. Kassi easily blocks the blows, though Mathers and Saric look to be barely surviving. You don’t react right away. The Emperor’s is not the embodiment of evil you imagined him to be. Plus, he seems to know about your past. He might be the only one who can answer the questions of your past.\n\nYou look back to the skirmish in front of you. The Emperor is slowly losing momentum. You can tell he realizes it too. He draws on arcane energy, and sends a blast of pulsing dark power towards Kassi. The blow knocks her sprawling across the room. The other two combatants, after seeing the magical power, attack fervently back.\n\n“Don’t just stand there, do something!” Mathers yells.\n\nIt’s time to choose. Will you take the Emperor’s side in hopes he can help you uncover your past, or will you stay true to your allies and risk the worsening nightmares?\n",
  "page 78": "You meet her assault with a series of overemphasized blocks. The crowd continues to be entertained by the unnecessary movements. You can almost feel the eye-rolling coming from Kassi as she watches the spectacle. Such technique would be ridiculed in the practice room, but it puts on a damn good show.\n\nConfident you’ve entertained the crowd long enough, you start to end the spectacle. You knock the rapier aside with enough force that the sword flies out of Priscilla’s hand. “Verna” clatters harmlessly to the floor, at the feet of the surrounding crowd, much to their delight. Priscilla stands in front of you with her arms up.\n\n“As expected, you win,” she says with a smile.\n\nNOT WHILE YOU’RE STILL BREATHING\n\n“Not while you’re still breathing,” you say, lifelessly.\n\n“Ok, not funny,” the smile drains from Priscilla’s face during her answer.\n\nYou remove the hidden sword from the cane. The crowd collectively gasps in horror. Priscilla begins walking backwards with her arms raised in surrender. You drive the point through her heart. Her white dress fills with the spreading blood stain. The crowd erupts in a mad frenzy. Soldiers immediately rush to Priscilla’s aid, although most of them attack you instead. Kassi joins your side with the gold rapier.\n\n“Gods damn you,” she speaks through a clenched jaw. “This night’s ruined, thanks to you.”\n\nMore soldiers file into the room surrounding you with full-bodied tower shields. Their spears all point toward you. You know your skill level as well as Kassi’s. The surrounding, growing force around you is too much, especially without your real weapons and armor. This is it, and you were so close to completing your lifelong quest.\n",
  "page 71": "The main hall is ceremoniously decorated. Lights hang from the high arched ceiling. Live music with various stringed instruments play at the center of the room. The musician\u0027s seats are arranged in a circle to evenly hit the room with music. You estimate there’s about two hundred guests, all dressed in their finest attire.\n\nServants pass by with plates of food and drinks. One notices your lack of cup, and places one in your and Kassi’s empty hands without asking. You sniff the cocktail and smell hints of orange followed by a strong alcoholic smell. In order to fit in, you take small sips being careful not to overdo it, especially since your body isn’t attuned to its effects. Dancing seems to be the main attraction in the room as most of the guests are either taking part or watching from afar. There is no sign of the Emperor, although you didn’t exactly expect him to be mingling about.\n\nYou make your way to the crowd gathered around the dancing guests. Not that you supposed anyone suspected you of anything, you just felt it best to keep a low profile. The grand spectacle before you is certainly something you’re not used to. Seemingly unlimited food, drink, and every pleasure imaginable is present. You doubt anyone here would survive a week at the monastery, save for the high-ranking military members. You feel a pat on your shoulder.\n\n“Swordmaster, I thought that was you. Fancy seeing you here. My, you look incredible. I didn’t think you owned anything besides that old robe of yours.”\n\nYou turn to see Priscilla, the daughter of General Hathis, one of your students. Her full-bodied red curls flow lightlessly down her back. In contrast to the white dress below, her sanguine hair looks even brighter. Your eyes are drawn to the gold rapier at her hip.\n\n“Surprised you managed to bring that needle of yours,” you say. “I should have brought mine too.”\n\nShe smiles. “Being my father’s daughter has certain benefits. Besides, any guard who would confiscate ‘Verna’ knows I would report them for being too handsy, a quick way to an early retirement.”\n\n“Perhaps next lesson we should go over proper sword naming technique.”\n\nShe attempts to give you a playful shove on the shoulder, but instinctively, you parry the blow aside. The guard tasked with protecting Pricilla, her father’s man if you had to guess, warningly slides his hand to his sword hilt.\n\n“Ha! No wonder you’re the top instructor in the Empire,” Priscilla says.\n\n“The Empire?” Kassi inputs. “As if my husband needs a bolster to his ego.”\n\n“That’s enough, you two,” you answer. “A swordmaster knows when he faces superior opponents.”\n\n“Speaking of which,” Priscilla says. “I’m sure the lovely people here would enjoy the spectacle of a sword demonstration. It might be good for your business too. Should we give them a show?”\n",
  "page 70": "“The day is finally here. Tonight the Emperor dies. Doe everyone understand their position?” Mathers asks leaning with both hands on the table.\n\nThe surrounding faces nod their heads and murmur their agreement, you and Kassi among them. Yuri stands with you as well. It turns out Vishal’s man is actually Mathers’.\n\nThe deadly blow Mathers discussed with you took several years of planning. There was the matter of getting people staffed as royal servants as well as scouting the layout of the fortress. Every tiny detail of the assassination was planned out ahead of time. Things seemingly insignificant, such as learning the names of each stablehand, were addressed. Mathers ran a tight ship and didn’t want any weak links.\n\nYou exit the tavern’s basement to stroll to your home. You and Kassi moved to the Empire’s capital city almost immediately after joining Mathers. There, you posed as newly weds in search of a better life. In fact, your cover included getting a job at a nearby fencing school. Mathers warned that someone is always watching in the capital city. The Empire keeps close tabs on its citizens that reside close to the Emperor, not that anyone could visit him. The Emperor never leaves the fortress, and the only way in is to be invited. It just so happens, you’ve received such an invitation.\n\nKassi walks by your side, and you put an arm around her for appearances. The capital city is far cleaner than Searing Rock. Streets are regularly maintained, and the increased amount of patrolling soldiers keeps thieves away.\n\n“I can’t believe we’re finally here,” she says.\n\n“It’s all been building up until now. Keep your blade sharp--”\n\n“--and your mind sharper,” she finishes for you.\n\nYou arrive at your home. Your house is tall and narrow. There’s limited amount of space in the capital city, and most buildings are built with such proportions. The first floor consists of a single room with a winding staircase that leads to the upper. As soon as you enter the doorway, you feel a cold chill run down your spine. You sense a presence you have not felt since the monastery.\n\n“Something wrong? You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” Kassi says.\n\nIT’S NOTHING\n\n“It’s nothing,” you blankly state. A subtle, mocking laugh subsides in your mind.\n\n“Alright then. Let’s prepare,” she says. “Let’s just hope that graceful footwork of yours holds up on the ballroom floor.”\n\nYou climb the staircase to the third floor. Hanging in front of a changing curtain is two magnificently designed outfits. The clothes are made with the current fashion design, though a little too tight in your opinion. You remove your clothes to clean up for the occasion. When you finish, you gaze in the mirror at the unrecognizable figure looking back.\n\nThough still on the young side, your face has long matured into manhood. Your clean-shaven face would require a razor’s attention if it were to keep its form this time tomorrow. Your tailored coat hangs to your mid-thighs, its black material matching the pants. You adjust the light scarf around your throat that seems to melt into the coat.\n\n“Are you really that uncomfortable? I’ve never seen you fidget that much, even including that time we spent three days hiding in the treetops of Langly Forest.”\n\nYou turn to see Kassi. Her hair is back to bright blonde. The few golden strands that have purposely escaped her hair tie hang loosely on her bare shoulders. Her raven-colored dress hugs tightly against her athletic, but still womanly, body.\n\n“You look…” you begin to say before blanking on the words.\n\n“I’ll take that as a compliment,” she smiles.\n\nShe picks up a gold-tipped cane and hands it to you.\n\n“Don’t forget this. Every proper gentleman has a cane.”\n\nYou grasp the metal-reinforced wood and swing it in the air as if a sword.\n\n“Reminds me of Brother Samuel,” you comment. You activate the locking mechanism, releasing the hidden sword blade underneath. “Although I don’t think his did this.”\n\nKassi eyes the blade. “Samuel’s cane was much more powerful. The holy sigils were placed by the Grandmaster himself. I think it’s oddly poetic you should carry a cane tonight, the night the monastery will be avenged.”\n\nYou nod. “It’s been a long road, but we’re finally here.”\n\nThe sound of a horse carriage brings you from your contemplative state. You exit the front door to find Yuri, finely dressed, and sitting in the driver’s seat.\n\n“You look wonderful, Miss Kassi,” he says. Turning to you, he adds, “Couldn’t find a larger size jacket?”\n\n“My jackets are always tight around the shoulders,” you retort mentioning to his belly. “While yours tend to be tight around the stomach.”\n\n“Ha-ha! Come, we have a party to attend,” Yuri says opening the carriage door for you.\n\nThe carriage take yous from the residential district, through the merchant quarter, and finally to the front gate of the fortress. A long line of carriages wait in line, while elite guardsmen take their time to search each guest. When it’s your turn, the guardsmen pat you down and search for weapons. The mage with them casts a spell on your jewelry searching for magical artifacts that could be a threat. You get waived through without any issue. Several stoic battalions are positioned in the entryway of the gate. At a moments notice, the entire fortress could be on lock down, and any intruders stuck inside. As soon as you pass through the gates, the same chill washes over you. You try to ignore it and continue inside.\n",
  "page 73": "You politely refuse, to the obvious disappointment of Priscilla. Her mood doesn\u0027t stay sour for long as a young man calls her name from across the floor. She scampers off, dragging her father\u0027s man along with her.\n\n“Ahem.”\n\nYou turn to see a dignitary with two elite guards at either side. His long flowing green hair and smoothly-shaved skin gives a youthful appearance, yet his eyes look more mature. The guards at either side stand stoic, their polaxes at the ready.\n\n“Yes? Can I help you?” you ask.\n\n“The Emperor summons you for a personal audience,” the man says with an air of superiority.\n\n“The Emperor? What does he want with me?” you ask. You’re not used to being caught off guard, and the man’s statement is not expected.\n\n“I am not here to answer your questions. Only to bring to His Majesty. Come along now.

  "page 72": "“Sure, why not. Just remember your training,” you answer.\n\n“Excellent! I’m afraid you’re not allowed to pick up a sword, so you’ll have to use that walking stick of yours,” Priscilla answers.\n\nOn much vocal direction from Priscilla involving the words “my father,” “whipped,” and “public shame,” the dancers clear from the area. The gathering crowd whispers among themselves in excitement at the upcoming display of combat.\n\n“So much for not drawing attention,” Kassi whispers in your ear.\n\nYou shrug. “It’s part of my cover,” you whisper back.\n\nYou remove your coat and roll up the sleeves of your tunic. As you walk to the center of the gathered circle of people, you loosen up your shoulders. Man, it feels good to be out of that damn jacket. You give the cane a few twirls to test the weight and balance. The crowd “oohs” at the simple motion. The slow, stringed music shifts to an upbeat tune with consistent low notes setting the tone for the fast and loose melody.\n\nA barefoot Priscilla meets you in the center with the golden rapier drawn. She acts like she’s about to say something, and then suddenly lunges forward with the rapier in attack position. You easily knock the blade aside and step back out of range. The cane, while not extremely heavy, is definitely a lot slower to wield than a rapier. You take a mental note to adjust for the speed difference.\n\nUsing more theatrics than you’re accustomed to, you twirl the cane and spin into your attack. You weave high, jumping overhead, striking with long and low thrusts. The crowd seems pleased and a cheer rises from the acrobatic movements. You’re acutely aware of Priscilla’s ability and don’t give her more than she can handle. Before each strike, you subtly give a “tell,” so Priscilla is alerted to your attack.\n\nOne heavy thrust removes a large section of the metal from your cane. The shiny piece falls to the ground with a clatter. You and Priscilla stop for a moment at the broken section. In the break in action, the chilling presence once again falls over you. For a brief moment, you see the flash of a skull behind Pricilla’s face. The image sticks in your mind for several blinks after.\n\n“Don’t worry, I’ll pay for that!” she shouts and begins another assault.\n",
  "page 75": "“Do not deny it. My spies are everywhere, even in the sanctuary of your inner circle,” the Emperor states. He slowly steps down the left side of the arched staircase and continues. “It’s a suicide mission, I’m afraid. In a few moments, your friend -- oh what’s the name she’s going by now...Mathers. Mathers will be taken into custody along with any accomplices, including your precious wife.”\n\nThe man speaks with utter conviction.

A descendent of divine blood mixed with the hellspawn of the Unbroken. I also know of the unrelenting curse that follows. I know because I am the same. We are brothers, you and I. Give up your futile vendetta against the Empire and let’s raise the curse that follows our family.”\n\nSuddenly, the double-doors swing open, and a blood-stained Mathers enters the room. The white on her waitress outfit is turned red. Followed behind her is the green-haired man and Kassi, both armed and just as stained. The trio walks up next to you and faces the Emperor leaving behind a trail of red footprints.\n\n“Thank you, Swordmaster, for distracting the Emperor’s watchful gaze long enough,” Mathers says. “I don’t think we would have made it through without. Heh, seems you overestimated whose inner circle was compromised.”\n\n“You’ll not survive this night. And you, Saric,” the Emperor addresses the green haired man. “Treason is punishable by death.”\n\nThe Emperor jumps past you, summoning a sword in either hand. He engages the trio with a flurry of strikes. Kassi easily blocks the blows, though Mathers and Saric look to be barely surviving. You don’t react right away. The Emperor’s is not the embodiment of evil you imagined him to be. Plus, he seems to know about your past. He might be the only one who can answer the questions of your past.\n\nYou look back to the skirmish in front of you. The Emperor is slowly losing momentum. You can tell he realizes it too. He draws on arcane energy, and sends a blast of pulsing dark power towards Kassi. The blow knocks her sprawling across the room. The other two combatants, after seeing the magical power, attack fervently back.\n\n“Don’t just stand there, do something!” Mathers yells.\n\nIt’s time to choose. Will you take the Emperor’s side in hopes he can help you uncover your past, or will you stay true to your allies and risk the worsening nightmares?\n",
  "page 74": "Kassi wanders around the great hall. Since you left, she’s tried mingling, but the Emperor’s summon is problematic. The night is planned out to the smallest detail. A summon from the assassination target himself isn’t something the group prepared for. A passing waitress stops in front of her.\n\n“Another drink, my Lady?”\n\nMathers stands in front of her with tray of colorful drinks.\n\n“Yeah, just give me a vodka,” Kassi answers. Lowering her voice she adds, “What’s the plan now? He’s been gone awhile.”\n\n“Here you go. Please try to enjoy the night, everything is planned for your entertainment,” the waitress, Mathers, says and leaves.\n\nKassi sips at the surprisingly good-tasting drink. She would enjoy the ability to partake tonight, keeping in full control of her senses. She didn’t know the next time she’d allow herself to taste the drink. It\u0027s distracting to her training, after all.\n\nKassi puts on her best cheerful face and attempts to interact with the citizens of the Empire. She hates each and every one of them, but sees her conversations as a test of discipline. Every instinct within her wants to enact revenge on the Empire for massacring the monastery. Kassi take a deep breath, forces a smile, and merrily greets the next citizen. She takes solace in Mathers’ words: everything is planned.\n",
  "page 132": "Deep in the Ellehorn forest, away from any main roads, crossings, or even hiking trails lies the camp. Well, with the amount of non-soldiers, refugees from the war, it’s turned into a small village. Naturally hidden by the overgrowth, it’s a mixture of hanging structures and huts. Narrow bridges connect the hanging structures to centralized platforms with simple rope and wooden planks.\n\nThe trees here are unlike any you’ve ever seen before arriving. Their trunks are several times thicker than the average oak. The trunks themselves are a dark brown, almost black despite the many pockets of sunshine firing through the canopy gaps. Heavy spots of moss line the base of the trunk, steadily rising to the structures’ height and above. As you arrive, several of the members greet you and take Mathers to the healer. Finally back home, you rub your aching shoulders and head for your hut.\n\nYour hut is among the hanging structures and suspends from one of the many massive branches growing from the oversized tree trunk. Due to its conditions, it takes on a natural sway, almost a bit like being on a ship. It feels normal now, comforting even, but it took some getting used it. The entryway is a simple piece of cloth blocking view from within -- it’s less private than a door, but lighter and more accommodating for the hut’s design. Inside, you have a bedroll and not much else. There’s little room and the space you do have, you use to practice your forms. Exhausted, you drop your gear next to the bedroll and collapse within it.\n\nFootsteps alert you back to consciousness. You lie still, unmoving, as not to draw attention to the fact that you’re awake. Through a thin slit in one eye, you see it’s now dark. The steps grow louder, although you can tell they are deliberate, attempting to be soft. They stop just outside the cloth door.\n\n“Your presence is not unnoticed. Who’s there?” you call into the dark.\n\nSilence.\n\nHeavy drowsiness falls over your eyes, and you fall back asleep. The events of the night are nothing more than a dream, fading from memory, forgotten by the morning.\n",
  "page 131": "“They’re gaining on us!”\n\nYou kick the stirrups, signaling the horse to quicken its pace. The road kicks up a dust storm behind you as the trees to your sides become a blurry green. Behind you, the white and gold riders slowly close the distance, their lances at the ready. Steadily, the wind rushes into your face, mirroring the labored breath from your horse. Your instincts tell you to duck, which you quickly act upon without a second thought, narrowly missing a javelin thrown from the closing Imperial riders.\n\nTo your left, Kassi shouts, “It’s no use! We should turn and fight!”\n\n“Nonsense, girl. We’re almost there,” Saric inputs from your right. Saric rides, framing the limp body of Mathers in front of him. Mathers’ back presses firmly against his chest, holding her upright in the saddle. The arrow wound to her side is a deep pool of red, the shaft still pointing out like a patriotic plant of a flag.\n\nYou take another glance back. “I agree. There’s too many of them. Lead on, Saric!”\n\nThe green-haired man kicks his horse forward, taking the lead among you and Kassi. Up ahead, the path sharply turns to the left. Trees on either side make up a narrow alleyway. Around the bend, you spot your destination. A deep ravine lies directly ahead, barely visible, unless you know it’s there. The ground angles up slightly before dropping steeply down the edge, creating a natural camouflage. As you pass by trees near to the edge, you catch the painted faces of your allies, hiding in the forest. Your horses clear the zone and veer right following the poorly, on purpose, maintained trail. The trap is set.\n\nTripwires lift from the ground, held by your allies hiding off the path. The Imperial riders slam into the traps, sending soldier from horse, and rendering their horses incapacitated. The riders at the front are thrown from the ledge, falling down the steep slope. Those in the back quickly meet their end by the sudden rush from the forest. Your allies easily cut down the riders, who are mostly too shaken to fight back.\n\n“See? Why make things harder for ourselves?” Saric asks.\n\n“Because it’s less fun,” Kassi answers.\n\n“Quick. We need to attend to Mathers’ wounds,” you say. The allies from the forest, many of them green-haired like Saric, approach and lift Mathers from the saddle. You follow them to the sanctuary.\n",
  "page 112": "An endless wave of white and gold lay ahead of her. She would hold back the tide just long enough for the next crashing. It was a losing battle and deep down, Kassi knew it. She had no illusion of the outcome; she’d been fighting far too long for any false hope to grip her. Victories don’t magically appear. They are won with superior tactic or sheer number. Before the battle even began, she knew the outcome.\n\nParry, feint, strike. The Imperial soldiers all fall to her simple technique. It’s like they had no formal training. Each after the next falls prey to the trident maneuver. Kassi draws in each opponent, unsuspecting, though now a little more cautious at the body count beneath her feet. She lets them attack first. Kassi stays deceptively a half step, no a quarter step out of their range. Their attack brings them off-balance, her feint brings them more so. Finally, the strike. Quick, deadly, like a viper she drops another.\n\nKassi’s aware of battle fatigue. She’s careful to not expend her energy needlessly. Perhaps, her younger self would have indulged in fanciful swordplay at the cost of endurance. No, she had to think of the long haul. Imperial troops would fall either way. She doesn’t need to defeat herself.\n\n“Kassi!”\n\nA voice draws her attention. Seth. The man looks as young as the day of the monastery massacre, still dressed in the same armored robe and twin blades. He points to the sky as one of the wyvern riders lands where she once stood. The jaws of the beast clamp air, narrowly missing Kassi rolling to the side.\n\nThe rider in all black armor stares at her, blankly, from behind his horned helm. Kassi notices the greatsword in his hand and recognizes it instantly. She sees it swing through the air and meet the Grandmaster\u0027s open palms. She sees sparks as if from a blacksmith’s hammer emit from the blade.\n\nShe will have revenge on the man who killed the Grandmaster. Seth takes the offensive first, weaving his twin swords into attack position. He slides underneath a swipe from the wyvern’s tail. Seeing her chance, Kassi flanks from the side, attempting to draw the rider’s focus in two different directions. Before she can strike, she gets intercepted by several Imperial soldiers. Parry, feint, strike. Just like the others, they fall to the three-pronged maneuver.\n\nDanger.\n\nKassi senses it -- a moment too late. The greatsword swings at her undefended back. Like a thundercrack, it meets the dual defense of Seth’s blades. In the distance, the wheelcrank of the inner gate starts to lower. Crank. The sound draws the attention of Aeric’s soldiers. They retreat towards the gate in fear of being locked out. Crank. Kassi regroups and lets loose a barrage of attacks at the wyvern rider. The rider manages to block some of the strikes, while the others bounce harmlessly from his plate armor. Crank.\n\n“It’s no use. Get out of here!” Seth shouts.\n\n“Yeah, like you’re doing any better!” Kassi replies back.\n\n“Kid, I’m just getting warmed up,” Seth answers, despite her age. He whispers into one of his rings and twirls his swords in the air. Both weapons ignite in searing, cold blue flame. Crank. “Go, now! You’ll just get in my way.”\n\nReluctantly, Kassi retreats for the inner gate. No longer controlled by youthful impulse, she understands the truth of Seth’s words. Her weapons are ineffective against the plate armored wyvern rider, and she won\u0027t throw her life away in a state of senseless revenge. She makes it to the other side of the gate just as it slams shut. Streaks of blue meet the white-hot sparks of the greatsword. The approaching Imperial army gets waved back by the rider. His dull, monotone voice rings from behind the helm.\n\n“I wonder, Myrmidon, if the girl would abandon you if she knew who you really were.”\n\nBlocking the greatsword, Seth answers, “She’s no longer just a girl.”\n",
  "page 111": "The two soldiers stationed outside of the throne room offer little resistance. In a fair fight perhaps they would, but the unsuspecting soldiers didn’t stand a chance. You swing open the double-doors, expecting to be met by more soldiers. Instead, only a handful remain. A man, King Aeric, sits on the throne watching you enter. Silent, you walk forward, Captain Wren and the others at your back.\n\n“You insult me wearing that armor,” King Aeric yells. His voice echoes in the large, empty room.\n\nYou remove the masked helm. “No disrespect, it’s simply out of necessity.”\n\nKing Aeric motions to the man at his side dressed in the same dark red that you remember Seth wearing. “Mordecai, is this him?”\n\nThe man pulls a strand of dark hair from his face. “Yes, my king.”\n\n“Strange. You’re the last person I expected to side with the Emperor. Many years ago, I heard tales of your success fighting the Imperial army. And now look at you, the famed warrior is but an attack dog for the Emperor,” King Aeric directs towards you.\n\n“Things are never as they seem. Like, for example, the protection you supposedly provided the monastery. Your military strength came from the very place you failed to protect. That’s why you’re here. Your four-decade failure has finally caught up to you,” you answer.\n\n“Ha-ha! You really have been brainwashed by the Empire’s propaganda. There is nothing that could have been done that day.”\n\n“Armies of that size don’t travel unnoticed. I’m certain you had reports of their activity well in advance of the attack. And what did you do? Hide in your castle. There’s no where else to hide, false king. You’ve been exposed for the coward you are.\n\nKing Aeric, visibly angered by your insult rises from his throne and spits on the ground in your direction. “I’ll not be spoken to like that in my own throne room. You speak of cowardice, and yet you raise your sword against an old man. That, is true cowardice.”\n\n“Shall I put the dog down, my king?” Mordecai asks.\n\nKing Aeric fixes his gaze on you. “Put him down.”\n",
  "page 199": "You cut your way through to the Imperial commander. Off in the distance, you see Horne masterfully backstabbing fleeing Empire troops. His talent for blending in extends to the battlefield, using the chaotic setting to catch his enemy unaware. The commander stands between two fully-plated knights with kiteshields. The commander’s thick mustache covers his top lip, but even then, you can see the tremble underneath.\n\n“Stop!” he shouts. “Lay down your arms and you will be given a merciful death.”\n\nThe two knights beside him point their spears in your direction for emphasis. You eye them for a moment, then wave your hand. Dark missiles fire from your open palm, bursting through the heavily plated knights. They crumple to the ground with a clash of metal brought on by their armor. Their spears roll harmlessly on the ground away from their limp hands.\n\n“The Emperor will deal with you. It’s my honor to die in his service,” the Commander says, charging forward.\n\nYou wait until he’s almost upon you. The commander’s sword is arced back, ready to strike the killing blow for his leader. You stand, unmoving, at the threat in front of you, so long that the commander actually believes his blade will strike true. At the last moment, you spin to your right and swipe your sword out in the his path. His charge takes him full force into your sword, separating his upper half from lower.\n\n“Your taste for the theatrical is most amusing,” the muffled voice of Horne speaks.\n\n“An enemy with nothing to lose is more dangerous than an overconfident one,” you say wiping the blood from your sword.\n\n“I have a hard time believe either pose a danger to you,” he answers.\n\n“I have a realistic understanding of my abilities,” you answer. “Though I’m not prideful or short-sighted enough to believe I cannot be beaten. No man is untouchable, not me, not the Emperor.”\n\n“Speaking of which,” Horne says. “The capital is ours for the taking.”\n\n“Rally the men. We march forward.”\n\nThe capital is built in a circular manner. The main keep lies in the center, surrounded by varying sections of the city. Besides the city walls, the residential and merchant portions of the city aren’t defendable. The keep is where the true defense lies. Tightly packed buildings, built more vertical than horizontal, fill the city. As the city grew, it looks like the only option was to build up rather than out. There’s only so much space within the city walls, even for a city as massive as the capital.\n\nAs you enter the city walls, alarm bells ring throughout the city. You don’t see many civilians; the shut doors and closed shutters alert you to their location. It seems the news of your arrival traveled quicker than expected, although it’s likely the people boarded up as the Empire’s main force went to meet Seth.\n\nSeveral groups of the city’s watch attempt to stop you, but they give less of a fight than the Imperial soldiers. There is little resistance up until the keep. The main gate into the fortress is shut, and you can see lines of soldiers standing at the ready within the courtyard. Archers stand overlooking the fortress’ walls, firing down on your force as you draw close. You order your men to scatter into nearby streets to avoid being freely fired upon.\n\nLeave them to me.\n\nLorthander raises his staff into the air and shouts incoherent words. Magic pulses into the air in a ripple, as if a stone dropped into a body of water. The ripples extend from the staff and pulse through the archers. The heavy rain of arrows stop for a moment, and then you hear cries from the keep walls. You see some of the archers lifelessly fall from the top, leaving behind red stains and protruding bone on the ground below. The top of the keep becomes a chaotic mess of infighting. Imperial soldiers fire on their own and take up arms against one another, similarly to your first steps inside the crumbling ruins Lorthander resided in.\n\nNo longer exposed to arrow fire, you charge the front gate. Simultaneously, you and Lorthander blast the gate with magic. The mix of shadow bolt and psionic wave shatter the metallic gate. With a screech of metal, the gate implodes, unable to bear its weight in the weakened condition. White and gold armored soldiers stand at the ready, but don’t meet your attack. They assume a defensive position, waiting for you to enter.\n\nKILL THEM ALL\n\n“Ki--\" you begin to command before resisting the voice. You feel it build within you. It wants to be released. It coaxes, wanting to let you rest and take control for awhile. And why shouldn’t you? You’ve fought hard enough up until this point. Why not allow it to finish things?\n",

You’d never witnessed him in his glory, but the man before you looks as if a shell of that. The large, headstrong king you heard stories about is absent. Instead, a white-haired man with hunched shoulders and black-ringed eyes sits before you. The King’s body may be brittle, but his eyes are stern, unflinching as he meets your approach. If King Aeric was never defeated in battle, he’s losing the war to old age: a strange thing for a king in times of war.\n\nYour first step up the to the throne is met with a vine-like bind around your ankle.

Sharp pain grips your leg, and you discover the attack shredded through the top section of your leather boot.\n\nMordecai slings the whip against the guardians, each impact holding them at bay or even knocking them back. Finally, the same vine-like grip wraps around Dodgey’s neck. The big man drops his weapon and shield and grabs at his throat. Mordecai activates his weapon once again to change form.

You raise your blade in the air to kill him, you raise your blade to kill a king.\n\n“It’s a shame she doesn’t have your gift,” King Aeric says. “When I heard the child from the monastery was within my walls I thought it was you. Unfortunately, it was just Kassi. Oh well, I suppose we made it here either way.”\n",

I\u0027m overdo by a few decades. Oh well, I have plenty of time.\"\n\nKing Aeric\u0027s face melts away. His skin droops down like melted wax. Shadowy wisps appear within his eyes, turning a glowing crimson. Through his forearms, two angled spikes appear, tearing through his own flesh. Aeric seems not to notice as the laugh continues through his drooping skin.\n\nThe laughter turns mocking, reminding you of...your childhood. The shade. The thing that\u0027s hunted you your entire life is before you. Hunting is much easier when the prey arrives on your doorstep. Before you can react, the angled spikes pierce through your gut, lifting you into the air. A pair of red eyes meet yours, taking pleasure in your suffering. The shade tears its spikes from your body, splitting you in two. It\u0027s taken nearly a lifetime, but the shade has finally finished the hunt.\n",
  "page 115": "Whatever trick King Aeric is trying to pull, it won’t work on you. People at sword point will say anything if they think it will save their life. Still, you have to take into consideration King Aeric’s calmness. He’s not acting like someone trying to preserve his life, and his words may hold truth based on that fact. Not that it matters, he still needs to die. It’s time to end this.\n\nWE MUST PRESERVE THE ROYAL BLOODLINE\n\nThe voice stays your blade for a moment. Then, you shake your head in attempt to clear the thought. You will not let the voice control your actions. Not now. Not in the moment of your Emperor’s glory. You drive your sword into King Aeric’s chest, piercing the seat cushion behind him, and quickly retract the blade. A sliver in King Aeric’s chest appears, oozing dark liquid. But it’s not blood. Black liquid, too thick for blood, rolls into the king’s shirt.\n\nThe voice appears -- wait no, this time it’s audible. The mocking laugh, the one that echoes within your mind, projects from King Aeric’s mouth. You realize then the laugh isn\u0027t from the voice within, but of a distant memory, one from your childhood. Behind you, the skirmish between Mordecai and the others halt as they notice the event happening at the throne. King Aeric’s body floats in the air, his feet hanging limp mere inches from the ground, his head cocked to his left shoulder. King Aeric’s body rises higher in the air, leaving a puddle of black sludge beneath.\n\n“Commander, what’s going on?” Big Sue asks. You notice he’s standing right next to Mordecai, peacefully, despite the circumstance that just occurred.\n\n“Our task remains unchanged,” you answer. “All threats to the Empire must be eliminated.”\n\n“And what if you are that threat?” Mordecai interjects.\n\nBefore you can answer, a sharpened talon grows from the underside of each of Aeric’s forearms. In a swirl of black mist, King Aeric, vessel of the Shade, dives at you. The Shade’s attack is blocked by your sword, and the impact drives you sliding across the throne room floor. Just then, a pair of women burst through the double doors, one with red hair and the other bright blonde. At the sight of the Shade dressed in King Aeric’s loose skin, the red-haired woman freezes. The woman next to her, Kassi, is taken aback for a brief moment and then continues on.\n\nThe Shade flies high in the air, leaving streaks of black mist. It winds around several hanging chandeliers. Each one it passes extinguishes, leaving the room barely visible as if soft moonlight shining through thin clouds.\n\nKassi, eyeing you, shouts, “First the spirit, then the traitor!”\n\nFor the time being, the small group of warriors inside the throne room unite against a common enemy, against a common evil. The Shade dives down in a black streak. You raise your sword in preparation. This time, however, it vanishes just before its attack. Silence. You survey the room for some indication where it will reappear. Off in the distance, the outside siege rumbles softly, though louder than before. The battle is drawing nearer to the throne room.\n\nSuddenly, the chandeliers relight in flash of bright light, forcing you to turn your eyes in the shift.\n\n“What unspeakable evil. Estella...” Mordecai whispers. Body parts hang, skewered, from the octopus-shape chandeliers. The woman’s face is frozen in a mix of horror and surprise. Her red hair hangs down too close to one of the candles. It ignites in a burst of flame, filling the room with the smell of burnt flesh and hair. There are too many limbs impaled to be Estella’s. You see another head, Rexxus\u0027. The weight of his thick neck slides his head down the chandelier like a bead on a string, and the firmness of his muscular arms hang limp, powerless.\n\ni can help\n\nThe voice speaks in your head. For the first time, it’s not forceful. It’s calm, suggestive, not born of impulse.\n\n“No, you’ll not control me,” you speak, confusing your allies.\n\nyou can’t hope to win without my power, our power. unleash us.\n\n“I’ll not trade one evil for another.”\n\nit’s the only way\n\nThe shade reappears, the wrinkled skin of King Aeric still hanging from its shadowy form, unnaturally stretched. The place where his wise eyes once sat are replaced with pure black, so dark that his sockets look empty like the opening of a cave.\n",
  "page 118": "No. You’ve spent your entire lifetime training your body and mind. You will not surrender for fear of death. The discipline instilled in you resists the temptation. If this is truly where you’re meant to die, at least you’ll die as yourself and not the puppet of some dark force. You breathe through the voice’s enticing. Each inhale brings you to the next moment, and every exhale is the death of that moment. No longer are you concerned with the voice taking over. Your focus is on each breath and the present moment. Silence from within, it seems to be quieted for now.\n\n“Commander, are you with us?” Captain Wren speaks.\n\n“Yes. I am,” you answer. Gesturing to Mordecai, you add on. “That staff may be the most effective weapon against this spirit. When we create the opening, strike hard and fast.”\n\nMordecai nods his agreement. “Here it comes again,” Kassi warns. A black streak of smoke dives down from the ceiling. Instead of standing your ground, you take off in a dead sprint in the opposite direction. So far, the shade has only targeted you in the aerial assaults, and you suppose it would target you again. Captain Wren steps in to engage the shade only to have Kassi push him out of the way.\n\n“You’re mine to kill, Imperial,” she spits.\n\nStill running, you take a peek back over your shoulder. The shade is almost upon you. The mutated face of King Aeric stares blankly toward you. Just before it strikes the killing blow, you leap in the air and kick off a column to extend your range higher. The shade crashes into the column right beneath you. A crack through the air echoes as Mordecai’s whip wraps around the shade holding it firmly in one place.\n\nYour feet touch the ground near the bound shade and you approach it. The shade squirms, trying to break free, but Mordecai holds it down. The whip glows a soft red, fueled by Mordecai’s incantation.\n\n“Long have you hunted me. No more. I\u0027ll not subject myself to your dark magic,” you speak.\n\nThe familiar resonating laughter fills your ears, though not in its mocking form. It’s distressed, like a wolf caught in a snare.\n\nIt speaks for the first time, and through its twisted, muffled voice, it’s apparent it’s a woman’s voice.\n\n“Ironic…you speak of dark magic with distaste, while housing the vilest within yourself.”\n\n“So I’ve heard,” you answer. “Although I do not allow it to control me.”\n\n“You can try to resist, but the Unbroken bloodline eventually will reveal itself. I’m sure it has already.”\n\nKassi joins in. “The only darkness affecting him is you. I witnessed the nightmares brought upon by your hunt. My respect is all but lost for this one, but I’d still not see you possess him.”\n\n“Ha! I’m not looking to possess him, girl. I’m looking to end the bloodline…even if they are my descendants as well.”\n\n“Princess Catherine?” Mordecai asks, in full recognition of Ragar’s history.\n\n“Once upon a time.”\n\n“And so you sold your soul for vengeance, trading one evil for another. Your tormenting ends now, Catherine,” you say, raising your sword.\n\nYou drive the point through King Aeric’s face, piercing the shade underneath. The shade, Catherine, shrieks, filling the throne room with sharp noise. A black hole appears at her torso, drawing in streaks of black mist and wisps. The shadowy form of Catherine fills the hole for a moment, and then bursts into an explosion of light. Upon the light’s subsiding, King Aeric’s mutilated body lays bound by the whip, the shade nowhere to be seen.\n\n“I still don’t forgive you,” Kassi breaks the silence. “After everything we’ve been through, you just…abandoned us, abandoned me.”\n\n“I’m sorry it came to that,” you softly answer. “The Emperor isn’t an evil man. We’re bound, he and I. We share the same bloodline. My episodes were getting worse. You might have been the victim of them.”\n\n“You must not know me well at all if you think you’d ever beat me.”\n\n“Kass, I’m serious. Innocent people around me die.”\n\n“I’m not so innocent.”\n\nMordecai walks up to you and places a hand on your shoulder, reassuringly that he’s not a threat. “Even I, my king’s most trusted advisor, did not see he was possessed by a spirit. You have my gratitude. I see the monastery has trained you well. Glad to see it was vigilant until the end, it certainly was during my days there.”\n\n“You were the king’s emissary once?” you ask.\n\n“Emissary? I won the honor to serve King Aeric through the Grand Melee. All who wear the dark red robe were once from the monastery. Speaking of which, where’s Seth?” Mordecai asks.\n\n“Didn’t make it,” Kassi answers.\n\n“Damned fool,” Mordecai whispers to himself. “Go, Swordmaster. There is nothing left for you here. The day is won, the fortress is yours. Report the King’s death to your Emperor.\n\n“Get yourselves to safety,” you answer pulling two small objects from your cloak. “These seals will allow you to pass through the Imperial army unharmed.”\n\nKassi offers a small laugh, a sign of the woman you once knew. “Please. Like we need your trinkets to move unhindered. Still though, the thought is well-received.” She takes the seals anyway. “So, I guess this is it,” she adds on.\n\nYou clasp her hand. “I guess so. Be safe, Kass.”\n\nShe looks into your eyes, gauging your intentions. For a brief moment, you flash back to the monastery and remember the passionate, bright blonde-haired girl who trained you. The girl who feigns lack of emotion to appear strong. The girl who is the perfect embodiment of the balance between discipline and joy. The girl who was the only one you could share personal thoughts with. The girl you turned your back on.\n\nYou release her hand and gently squeeze her arm. “Go now.”\n\nKassi and Mordecai leave together, while Captain Wren and Big Sue silently watch. They do not vocalize their protest, though you can tell it doesn’t sit well with them.\n\nCaptain Wren approaches you. “Are you sure we should just let them leave? They are the enemy, after all.”\n\nYour eyes meet his. “If they were truly your enemy, you would not be breathing right now.”\n",
  "page 117": "You break down your mental defenses, allowing the voice to take command. In an instant, the fortitude that you’ve built up is demolished. While you haven’t been able to block the more powerful urges, you’re certain your training has defended against the smaller, more subtle influences. This is the first time you’ve allowed it to take over, and aren’t sure what the consequences will entail. All you know is that a terrible, and powerful, evil stands before you, and you’ll do whatever it takes to defeat it. The voice creeps in to portions of your mind that were previously blocked off. It’s intrusive, and yet strangely comforting.\n\nA scream escapes your lips, and the world before you turns a dark, primal color. Like ink soaking into parchment, your eyes shift solid black. Strength pours into your limbs. It’s unlike anything you’ve ever felt before; it’s exhilarating, like pure nirvana. Your heightened senses allow you to view the battle before you with clarity. You know exactly what you must do to obtain victory. You open your mouth to issue commands.\n\nSilence. The words you try to speak don’t appear.\n\n“What’s going on? What’s wrong with him?” Kassi yells at Captain Wren.\n\n“I— I don’t know! I’ve never seen this before,” The Captain replies.\n\nA sickening feeling starts deep within your consciousness, yours, not the power controlling you. You have no influence over your body. You’re just the vessel in which the dark power lives. The voice has full control. The suppressed Unbroken blood within you has surfaced with a vengeance.\n\nThe Unbroken tosses your sword aside, letting it clang harmlessly on the floor. Dark energy materializes at your hands. Shadowy, dark purple flames extend from your palms and solidify, creating a translucent axe in one hand and a sword in the other. The Shade, flies forward for another assault. You see everything in perfect clarity, not that you can do anything about it.\n\nThe Unbroken rises to meet the Shade. In a supernatural leap, the Unbroken is a whirlwind of sword and axe. The shadowy weapons tear into the Shade. It screeches, only enticing the Unbroken to increase the zealous attack. The Shade collapses on the floor, a black hole appearing at its center. Black mist and wisps surround the hole, drawn in like a magnet. In an explosion of light, the Shade vanishes, leaving behind King Aeric’s disturbed, mutilated corpse.\n\n“Holy shit. I’m glad you’re on our side,” Captain Wren comments. “Speaking of which,” he adds on, “What should we do about them?”\n\nKassi and Mordecai stand your opposite. They do not have their weapons raised, but their unwavering gaze indicates they are at the ready just in case.\n\nALL WILL SUBJECT TO THE UNBROKEN\n\nThe voice speaks from your mouth, and you’re helpless to stop it. You try to scream, to regain control in any sort of way. Nothing. Your body is but a puppet for the voice to work.\n\n“So be it,” Kassi speaks raising her blade. “Consider this your final lesson, ‘Swordmaster.’”\n\nBeside her, Mordecai spins his staff at the ready. Captain Wren nods to you and charges forward. Big Sue follows closely in suit. Kassi easily dismantles the assault, spinning to her right and parrying away each blow. Mordecai steps in with his staff to intervene.\n\nThe Unbroken walks towards the skirmish with your palm outstretched. Dark purple energy briefly crackles before a thunderous crack fills the throne room. The sudden burst of sound pauses the action for a moment. A body collapses. Mordecai. A sizable hole in his chest is visible, the result of the Unbroken’s dark bolt.\n\nSHE IS MINE\n\nBoth of your palms outstretched now, the Unbroken turns his attention on Wren and Sue. An unseen force pulls their bodies into the air. Your hands close into knuckle-whitening fists. At the same time, their bodies fold inward with a sickening crack. As your hands release, the lifeless bodies of Captain Wren fall to the ground, their limbs outstretched in an unnatural manner.\n\n“You truly have become the monster the Grandmaster was afraid of,” Kassi speaks. “We adopted you as our own, to teach you how to master your mind and body so this wouldn’t happen.”\n\nYOU’RE THE REASON FOR MY DELAYED RETURN. I WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER FOR THAT.\n\n“You are lost. I see that now. I will put an end to your life out of mercy. Goodbye, my friend…I love you.”\n\nKassi rushes forward. A bolt fires from your palm. Kassi evades the attack and swipes at your neck. Her attack is too quick. There’s no way your body can physically dodge in time. Suddenly, you’re viewing Kassi from her backside. A small puff of smoke floats from where you once stood. You see her exposed back and the shadowy axe raised.\n\ni hope you enjoy this as much as i do.\n\nThe voice speaks inwardly, mocking you in the soothing tone it used earlier. She attempts to turn. Damn it, she’s quick. Not quick enough. The blade of the axe cuts through her back, exposing her severed spine. Kassi falls face-first, twitches for a moment, and then lies completely still.\n\nClap, clap, clap. The Unbroken turns your head to view the doorway of the throne room. The Emperor stands in the entryway, clapping at the turn of events.\n\n“My, my, I’m impressed,” he speaks with glistening green eyes. “In all my research, to witness the power for myself…it’s remarkable.”\n\nThe Unbroken brings you body to stand before the Emperor. One side of his face is blood-soaked from the siege. The red liquid partially mats his long strands of hair. From within your body, you know exactly what will happen next.\n\n“False king.”\n\nThe words from your mouth are in your voice, though controlled by another.\n\n“So you can sense it. I shouldn’t be surprised. After what I just witnessed, nothing you do should surprise me,” the Emperor says. “Such a shame, I had high hopes for you.”\n\nFrom within his cloak, he draws an artifact. The Unbroken snarls in recognition: the Grandmaster’s medallion. The Emperor’s eyes close as he draws upon the holy power. The sigil on the medallion emits a bright white light, mirrored in the Emperor’s eyes as he opens them. Searing pain fills your body, and your mouth emits an unworldly scream. The screech builds to the point where blood spills from your ears, the result of shattered eardrums.\n\n“I’m sorry it has to end this way. I really did want us to conquer together,” the Emperor says.\n\nThe pain is so great that you lose consciousness.\n",
  "page 88": "Dawn brings hope of a new day. The rain has subsided, and long rays of sun shoot through the partly cloudy sky. Though the ground is still muddy, the Empire troops’ spirits are elevated by the mostly dry march. Battle horns ring through the camp, signaling the men for organization and movement.\n\nA man introduces himself to you as Captain Wren. “We are a special unit designed with taking down casters,” he says. “There’s four of us total. Myself, Dodgy, Rexxus, and Big Sue. We’ve been through more than enough action and look forward to being led by someone so close to the Emperor,” he adds with a salute.\n\n“I as well, Captain,” you reply. You look behind the lean captain at the rag-tag trio. The skinny man with the darting eyes you assume to be Dodgey. The other two are easily as distinguishable. Rexxus is a tanned, bald man built like an ox. Big Sue is portly and looks to have not shaved in years.\n\nYou walk up to the trio. “Glad to have you here, gentlemen. Follow my lead and we’ll live to bring more glory to the Empire. Even you, Dodgey,” you say, lightly slapping his arm.\n\n“I’m Big Sue!” he exclaims.\n\n“I’m Dodgey,” the portly man bellows.\n\n“Sure you are,” you answer, surprised. “I’m honored to lead you. I’ve heard stories of the famed Breakers. You’ve taken out more than your fair share of mages, priests, and sorcerers.”\n\n“And look good while doing it,” Big Sue says, using a sizeable knife to motion combing his hair back.\n\n“Do you have knowledge of how we work?” Rexxus inputs.\n",
  "page 87": "You don’t leave your tent right away. You leave soon enough that it wouldn’t seem disrespectful, but not right as Dawson requests. Where is the honor in execution? Killing an unarmed prisoner isn’t exactly your idea of the word. The more you think about it, the more you justify the action. The honor does not lie in the deed itself, but in the obedience of the order. Devoting your allegiance to a ruler and following their command is honorable. The infantryman outside your tent leads you to the center of the camp, where Saul is held prisoner.\n\nThe man before you is almost unrecognizable from your previous meeting. His well-maintained beard is a bushy, scraggly mess. The slight graying of his hair, once a symbol of orderly intelligence, is now pure white and unkempt. His left eye is bruised, so much that it looks stuck in a shut position. His hands are bound by rope, but his feet are untethered. It’s something you’ve seen before, the will to escape beaten out. The tiny slimmer of hope is gone. There’s no hopeful chance at breaking free. There’s no “if only I could break from my chains, I could run free” thoughts. There lies only a broken man, beat and scarred.\n\nSaul looks up with his good eye. “Fate truly is a cruel mistress,” he croaks, recognizing you despite your maturity.\n\n“Fate, destiny, is but a reflection of your action,” you answer. “You know why you’re here, what brought you to this moment. You didn’t magically appear a traitor out of nowhere.”\n\n“I had no choice!” Saul yells, coughing a few drops of blood in front of him. “It was either die back then or die now.”\n\n“And so you chose to buy yourself a few more years. The price: your name will be uttered with contempt. Your name will be associated with traitorous action. Tell me, spy, was it worth it?”\n\n“Just…end it.”\n\nYou think it best to put the broken man out of his misery. You remove your sword from its sheath and raise it overhead -- then the voice appears.\n\nHA-HA-HA\n\nYou lower your blade and a small chuckle escapes your lips. The Empire soldiers around you look at each other in confusion. No! Fight the voice! You take a breath and lift the sword again.\n\nYOU WANT TO KNOW THE FUCKING BEAUTY OF IT?\n\nYou struggle, then the voice takes over. Your mind is not your own. It’s like someone else, something else has taken the reigns of your existence. You helplessly watch through dead, unblinking, eyes.\n\n“You want to know the fucking beauty of it?” you ask. “She was resistance. Mathers was resistance the entire time. You spent your tenure as an outpost commander informing the enemy when you didn’t have to. She played you, Saul. She played you fucking hard.”\n\nWith a cry, Saul charges towards you. Suddenly, control is back in your body. No longer are you watching from the outside. The last thing you are is helpless. You wait until he’s almost on top of you. The surrounding Empire soldiers stand and watch. No one lifts a finger to help you. At the last moment, just before Saul can attack, you spin down to one knee and arc your sword behind you. You don’t see the cut, but the head landing in front of you is the sign your aim was true.\n\nYou hear clapping from behind you. The Emperor, enjoying the show, gives you a slight smile through the rainfall.\n\n“Only you could make a play out of an execution,” he says. “Consider me a fan. I eagerly await the sequel.”\n\n“Thank you for the honor,” you say with a bow.\n\nOn a more serious note, he says, “Come to my tent. We should discuss your condition.”\n\nIf you thought your tent was too lavish, the Emperor’s is infinitely more. The interior is filled with finely-carved furniture, including an entire dining table. Somehow, the Emperor managed to bring a collection of books, which line an entire section of the squarely-shaped canvas. The chandelier and sculptures are also a bit much in your opinion.\n\nThe Emperor removes his cloak and hands it to a servant, who silently hangs it on a rack. The Emperor sits at the dining table, and you take the seat across from him. The rest of the table stretches out, empty and lonely. He stares at you with his piercing green eyes.\n\n“It’s getting worse, isn’t it?”\n\n“Not in number, but in severity,” you answer, honestly.\n\n“Just as I feared. I promise you, we’re close to finding a cure.”\n\n“How close?”\n\n“I believe the secrets we search for are in Aeric’s castle. There’s something dark powering their defense. That’s why they have resisted me for so long.”\n\n“I can still hardly believe they’ve held out for decades now,” you say. “Sure, it’s a fortified position in difficult terrain, but still, to resist your might for so long. There must be something else at work.”\n\n“Exactly. We will break through their defenses together, capture the last remaining resistance stronghold, and free you of the voice,” The Emperor says, rising to his feet. He clasps your hand, reassuringly, and continues. “Rest up, my friend. Tomorrow all our goals will be accomplished. I leave you to your sleep unless you have any questions for me.”\n",

  "page 80": "Kassi wanders around the great hall. Since you left, she’s tried mingling, but the Emperor’s summon is problematic. The night is planned out to the smallest detail. A summon from the assassination target himself isn’t something the group prepared for. A passing waitress stops in front of her.\n\n“Another drink, my Lady?”\n\nMathers stands in front of her with tray of colorful drinks.\n\n“Yeah, just give me a vodka,” Kassi answers. Lowering her voice she adds, “What’s the plan now? He’s been gone awhile.”\n\n“Here you go. Please try to enjoy the night, everything is planned for your entertainment,” the waitress, Mathers, says and leaves.\n\nKassi sips at the surprisingly good-tasting drink. She would enjoy the ability to partake tonight, keeping in full control of her senses. She didn’t know the next time she’d allow herself to taste the drink. It\u0027s distracting to her training, after all.\n\nKassi puts on her best cheerful face and attempts to interact with the citizens of the Empire. She hates each and every one of them, but sees her conversations as a test of discipline. Every instinct within her wants to enact revenge on the Empire for massacring the monastery. Kassi take a deep breath, forces a smile, and merrily greets the next citizen. She takes solace in Mathers’ words: everything is planned.\n",
  "page 82": "The Emperor was within our grasp and we let him slip through our fingers. In the end, it was my hesitation that allowed the Emperor to escape. I vow to never allow thought to disrupt my actions again. Everything was riding on that moment; my entire life was building up to that confrontation. And what happened? My personal feelings stayed my sword arm.\n\nStill, I am a student of my mistakes. I’ve pondered many times why my arm was so affected. I’ve trained my whole life to sharpen my instincts, that my actions would be swift and sure. I could blame it on surprise, and perhaps that played into it. The Emperor surely did not turn out to be the aged, embodiment of evil I build him up to be. No, that can’t be the sole reason for my failure. The failure is mine, not my friends’. I will continue to look, introspectively, for the root of the problem. Once identified, I will cut away, with scalpel-like precision, the thing holding me back.\n\nI return back to my practice for answers. My mind is quieted only by the forms. I flow through my sequences to calm the storm of questions inside. There is much I don’t understand, even at this stage in my life. There is not much else I can do. I return to my practice.\n",
  "page 81": "“Do not deny it. My spies are everywhere, even in the sanctuary of your inner circle,” the Emperor states. He slowly steps down the left side of the arched staircase and continues. “It’s a suicide mission, I’m afraid. In a few moments, your friend -- oh what’s the name she’s going by now...Mathers. Mathers will be taken into custody along with any accomplices, including your precious wife.”\n\nThe man speaks with utter conviction. You can tell the difference between a bluff in an attempt to gather information and a man speaking the truth. You deal with it routinely in swordplay; there’s always a slight sign of a man feinting. It may be subtle, but it’s there and you’ve trained your whole life to spot it. There’s no mistaking it, the Emperor knows about the assassination attempt.\n\n“Then why are we still alive?” you ask. “The obvious action would be to execute us, publically, to dissuade future attempts.”\n\n“All that can be arranged later. I’m more interested in the man who survived the monastery...and more importantly, the child who survived the shade.”\n\n“You’d have plenty of witnesses if you didn’t order them all killed,” you retort.\n\n“Yes,” the Emperor mulls. “It’s a shame those barbarians allowed bloodlust to take over. Their orders were to capture Aeric’s throne. Instead, they rampaged throughout the land, slaughtering all in their way. I had to order a battalion of my own to put them down. I’m sure you find comfort in knowing the monastery’s attackers were all executed. Not quickly, I might add.”\n\n“They’re all your own. The way I see it, you ordered the attack. The monks were peaceful. They did nothing to deserve the attack.”\n\n“Ahh, spoken like a true devotee. It’s no secret the monks in the mountains bred the finest warriors in the territory. Tell me, Swordmaster, who protected the monastery?”\n\n“Aeric was supposed to.”\n\n“And what did Aeric receive in return?”\n\nSuddenly, it’s clear. The monks provided their finest warrior to Aeric each year after the Grand Melee. The monks were actively providing King Aeric with elite soldiers. In other words, they were supplying a nation in opposition to the Empire with troops.\n\n“I’ll take your silence as agreement,” the Emperor says. “The monks were in opposition to the Empire. I’m not justifying the action of those animals, but I’m simply stating true neutrality is a false ideal. You’re either an ally or enemy, which brings me to you. I know what hunts you. I know the nightmares you’ve been having. I can help you if you merely align yourself to me.”\n\nYou feel a familiar shiver down your spine.\n\n“What do you know of the nightmares?” you ask.\n\n“I know of your past and the great power that lies within. A descendent of divine blood mixed with the hellspawn of the Unbroken. I also know of the unrelenting curse that follows. I know because I am the same. We are brothers, you and I. Give up your futile vendetta against the Empire and let’s raise the curse that follows our family.”\n\nSuddenly, the double-doors swing open, and a blood-stained Mathers enters the room. The white on her waitress outfit is turned red. Followed behind her is the green-haired man and Kassi, both armed and just as stained. The trio walks up next to you and faces the Emperor leaving behind a trail of red footprints.\n\n“Thank you, Swordmaster, for distracting the Emperor’s watchful gaze long enough,” Mathers says. “I don’t think we would have made it through without. Heh, seems you overestimated whose inner circle was compromised.”\n\n“You’ll not survive this night. And you, Saric,” the Emperor addresses the green haired man. “Treason is punishable by death.”\n\nThe Emperor jumps past you, summoning a sword in either hand. He engages the trio with a flurry of strikes. Kassi easily blocks the blows, though Mathers and Saric look to be barely surviving. You don’t react right away. The Emperor’s is not the embodiment of evil you imagined him to be. Plus, he seems to know about your past. He might be the only one who can answer the questions of your past.\n\nYou look back to the skirmish in front of you. The Emperor is slowly losing momentum. You can tell he realizes it too. He draws on arcane energy, and sends a blast of pulsing dark power towards Kassi. The blow knocks her sprawling across the room. The other two combatants, after seeing the magical power, attack fervently back.\n\n“Don’t just stand there, do something!” Mathers yells.\n\nIt’s time to choose. Will you take the Emperor’s side in hopes he can help you uncover your past, or will you stay true to your allies and risk the worsening nightmares?\n",
  "page 84": "Am I a monster? My entire life led up to the confrontation with the Emperor. The evil man I imagined him to be wasn’t the man who stood before me. I was faced with someone human, someone like me. Often, there are no solid lines between a good decision and a bad one. The edges are blurred, and we must do our best to navigate.\n\nWas my decision the correct one? Many times I have asked myself that question. Kassi certainly doesn’t think so. The correct decision, the incorrect decision, at this point it does no use to wonder which path was most right. That, for sure, is the correct decision.\n\nIn some ways, the monster I imagined the Emperor to be was simply a projection of my inner demons. I had opposition, I identified the enemy; if only I had discovered, sooner, the true enemy was the corruption that lives within me, my shadow nature. My target has been realigned. My true enemy lies within.\n",
  "page 83": "The past is the past. The Emperor may offer the ability to confront your past and your dark nature, but your present allies are more important. You decide to act, pushing the Emperor back with a kick. Mathers instantly releases a series of strikes and cuts towards the off-balanced Emperor. Saric cuts his sword at the backpedaling Emperor -- at least, he attempts to. Saric’s sword slices through a wisp of black smoke; the dark mist dissolves and reveals the room empty, save for you and the three assassins.\n\n“Is he dead?” Kassi asks, recovering from the magic blast.\n\nAn alarm bell echoes throughout the keep and you start to hear footsteps approaching. The stomping of boots steadily rival the constant ringing.\n\n“I don’t think so, unfortunately,” Mathers answers.\n\n“We’re about to be if we stay here any longer,” you point out.\n\n“Come,” Saric directs. “I know a secret way out.”\n\nSaric leads you, Mathers, and Kassi to the eastern balcony. He nonchalantly gazes at the bookcase, mumbling numbers. “Ah, here we are,” he says, stopping at a series of green leather-bound books. He presses a few of the books in towards the back of the bookcase. Each time, a mechanical click echoes in the room. Suddenly, the entire section of the bookcase swings open, revealing a hidden passage.\n\nSaric looks at you and the other two expectantly. “Well. Don’t just stand there.”\n\nYou take the lead with Kassi right behind you. She gives your arm a small reassuring squeeze. You enter the darkness, not knowing what the future has in store. One thing’s for certain: you would not let the Emperor escape a second time.\n",
  "page 86": "Rain pours on the encampment, souring the battalion’s mood. Steady rainfall turned the ground into a brown mess of mud. The same could be said for traditional white and gold armor of the Empire’s troops. The mountain stood a tall, ominous shadow in the distance. Through the cloudy night sky, only the base could be seen through the downfall. The conditions didn’t help the men’s morale; your struggle is quite literally an uphill battle.\n\nYou sit in your tent, listening to the beat of the raindrops. The thick drops hit the canvas with a low-pitched thud. As far as mobile tents go, yours is much more extravagant than you’d prefer. The Emperor is a smart man. He knows the large structure will improve your standing with the men. Nothing shows authority like having a larger tent.\n\nInside, you have ample room for a bed, traveling gear, armor stand, weapon stand, and a practice mat. The mat is where you spend most of your time. It’s your place of refuge, your place to transcend the day. While your fellow commanders drink the good wine, eat the good food, and fuck the good women, you devote yourself to your forms, to your practice.\n\nYou sit on the mat cross-legged, meditating on the word that your mind is obsessed with. The word, your mantra, appears whenever you shut your eyes or take a deep breath. It’s the thing that keeps you going, even when the shadow nature feels as if it’s taking over. The word, mastery. Footsteps sound from outside your tent, followed closely by a man entering through the tent flaps.\n\n“Commander Dawson. How kind of you to join me,” you say.\n\nDawson removes his helm and shakes out his dark curly hair. “If I’m going to be still and shut my eyes, I’d prefer to do it in my bed after a few cups of wine.”\n\n“We all have preferences, Commander. Some beneficial, some detrimental,” you respond.\n\n“I did not come here to debate,” Dawson states. “There’s been an incident. We’ve captured the spy from Narrow’s Edge. I think you’ve met. Saul is his name. He’s been brought here to face judgement.”\n\n“He was brought all the way here?” you ask, surprised. “The Empire’s protocol is for immediate execution.”\n\n“That’s right,” Dawson sighs. “The protocol needs the jurisdiction of a higher-ranking member. Saul was the fort commander, very high ranking. Someone at his level needs an equal or higher-ranking judge. We are the closest that meet the criteria. Plus, I’m sure whoever caught him knows the Emperor is in camp. Probably came all the way here for an extra reward.”\n\n“You fit the criteria. Why don’t you execute him and be done with it?”\n\n“The Emperor wanted you to do the honors.”\n\n“Who am I to pass up the ‘honor’ of holding the executioner’s axe? I will be there shortly,” you say.\n\nCommander Dawson bows, equips his horned helmet, and takes his leave.\n",
  "page 85": "You close your eyes, take a deep breath, and silently hope you’ve made the right decision. You intervene the skirmish at the last possible moment. Mathers knocks the Emperor off balance and Saric drives his sword into the undefended Emperor -- or at least he attempts to. You anticipate the attack and catch Saric’s hands before the swordpoint can drive home. Twisting his wrists, with a sickening snap, you drive his own sword into his chest.\n\n“What the--” Mathers begins to say in surprise before the Emperor removes her head.\n\nKassi stands near the double-doors in horror of the scene before her. “How could you?” she questions before slipping out.\n\n“Thank you, my friend. I will not let your act go unrewarded,” the Emperor says, dispelling his two summoned blades.\n\n“I think you’re the only person in the world who would call me that now,” you say.\n\n“Not so. The Empire is vast and deeply loyal to its citizens.”\n\n“Perhaps in the capital. I’ve traveled all over your Empire, and the people seem more loyal to themselves than others.”\n\n“I don’t think you intervened to discuss the Empire’s loyalty. I imagine you want something in return. I don’t take your action lightly, Swordmaster, I will see that you have everything you desire.”\n\nYou nod. “Riches and comforts don’t interest me. I seek knowledge and the ability to undo whatever lies in wait.”\n\nThe Emperor offers his hand for you to pledge loyalty. “You shall have it and more.”\n",

Twice a day, a scarred man arrives and shoves liquid down your throat to keep you alive. You’re powerless.\n\nThe Unbroken still guides your body, not that it moves. The shackles around your body were created by the Emperor himself. It resists the Unbroken’s power, holding your body firmly in place. A man enters the room, the Emperor.

Realizing you’re broken from the meditative state, you remove the blindfold and hop down from the balancing beams.\n\n“You interrupted my practice,” you comment.\n\n“You wouldn’t be able to do that if it wasn’t for me teaching you,” she replies.\n\n“Fair enough.”\n\n“So...the Grand Melee is coming up. Do you know which event you’re entering?”\n\n“Not yet. What about you?”\n\n“Unarmed combat, of course. I won it last year.”\n\n“I didn’t enter last year,” you point out.\n\n“True. Enter it then. Unless you’re scared.”\n\n“Remind me again, what are the different categories?”\n\n“Unarmed combat, form mastery, and dueling.”\n\n“Tell me more about…”\n",
  "page 19": "“Tell me more about Dueling,” you say.\n\n“This is my second favorite,” she answers. “It’s a lot like the unarmed format except you’re armed.”\n\n“So it’s one on one?” you ask.\n\n“Yep! The winners keep fighting until there’s one left.”\n\n“Do you have a choice in the weapon?”\n\n“No, it’s random. You pull a stone from a bag and get the weapon it stands for. Think you’ll enter?”\n",
  "page 145": "Sitting at a fire, pitcher of wine at her feet, is Mathers. She takes a sip from the cup, staring deep into the dancing flames in front of her. Seeing you arrive, she offers the pitcher. Your open palm, signaling no, causes her to top her cup off and place the pitcher back on the ground.\n\n“Looks like I’m drinking for two,” Mathers says.\n\nYou gaze at the flames illuminating her chestnut hair. “We have much to think about. I’d rather keep my senses about.”\n\n“Are you sure you were from a monastery? I’ve heard stories of the Brothers and their mead intake.”\n\nA slight laugh escapes your lips. “Heh. My mentor, Samuel, lived off the stuff.”\n\n“Share a cup in his memory?”\n\nThis time you allow Mathers pour you a cup. Clinking them together, you both take a sip. Brother Samuel. His hand was always filled with either mead or his cane. If there was anyone you could approach for advice, especially at a time like this, it would be him.\n\n“Leaving is the best option, you know,” Mathers says. “It’s never wise to stay in one place long.”\n\n“I see the truth in the statement. Though there is also a time to stand your ground,” you say.\n\n“Not in this case,” she answers.\n",
  "page 5": "You roll over in your bunk. Instead of the usual sun rays hitting the small window in the room, you’re met with darkness followed by more darkness. Groaning, you pull yourself out of bed and tip toe from the sleeping quarters. The other students are sound asleep...until you open the door. Candlelight from the outside hall pours into the room and awakens a few kids near the doorway. In unison, just like the forms, they place their pillows over their eyes, but not before you catch glimpses of their half-asleep pouts. Your shared misery brings a small grin to the corner of your lips.\n\nYou arrive at the training room to find Kassi already there.\n\n“You’re late,” she comments.\n\n“The sun isn’t up. You said ‘before sunrise,’” you reply.\n\n“That means an hour before the sun is up,” she answers. Her strict tone subsides. “I’m surprised you made it here at all. How did you wake yourself in time?”\n\n“I thought really hard about waking up early and I did.”\n\n“Good. Next time think an hour earlier. We’ll go through each of the forms and I’ll correct you,” Kassi instructs.\n\nShe begins to tie her hair back into a single ponytail. The way she nonchalantly ties it back along with her commanding tone makes you think she’s older than she looks.\n\n“How old are you?” you ask while maintaining the form.\n\n“Did anyone teach you not to ask a girl that?” she asks.\n\n“No. Are you not supposed to?”\n\n“No. There, now you know not to.”\n\nYou complete the rest of the practice and realize the sun is starting to appear over the hills. Sunrise meant it was time for morning meditation. You and Kassi head to the prayer chamber together.\n\nOn your way she asks, “Same time tomorrow?”\n\nYou reply with a nod.\n",
  "page 18": "“Tell me more about Unarmed Combat,” you say.\n\nA smile lights up on her face. “It’s easily the most fun category.”\n\n“Yeah, and?” you prod.\n\n“And they pair you against an opponent in the ring. The winner moves on, the loser doesn’t.”\n\n“Is it striking only?” you ask.\n\n“No, of course not. Anything goes really. Except attacks on the eyes.” she replies. “Do you think you’ll enter?”\n",
  "page 144": "Saric sits at the council table. Several books lie open on the table as he references different passages in them, occasionally writing a thought down on the blank parchment beside the books.\n\n“Do you find the answers you seek in the texts?” you ask taking a seat on the opposite side of the table.\n\n“Not always the answers I seek, but I always find answers,” Saric replies, jotting another note down.\n\n“There is wisdom in approaching past lives for guidance,” you say.\n\n“Depends who you approach.”\n\n“What are your thoughts on relocating?” you ask.\n\n“I haven’t decided yet. There could be conflicting interest in discussing such matters. Vote what you will, and I’ll do the same.”\n\n“Fair enough,” you answer. “I’ll leave you be.”\n\nSaric grunts a reply, focus is back on the books in front of him.\n",
  "page 8": "After Brother Samuel leaves the room, you turn to Kassi. “Sorry if I took it too far.”\n\n“It’s fine. I just don’t like losing. Especially to the outlaw,” she answers.\n\n“Outlaw?” you question.\n\nShe sighs. “That’s what some of the other kids call you. Since you aren’t one of us.”\n\nYou understand her meaning. The other kids were brought to the monastery from birth. Your history was unknown to them, and more than a few children near your age were turned down. They don’t understand why you’re allowed to stay or why Brother Samuel has taken such an interest in you. Part of it could be jealousy, part of it could be the nature of kids. Perhaps a bit of both.\n\nChanging the subject you ask, “How’d you get so good with your forms?”\n\n“Brother Trevor always had it out for me. A lot of extra time in the practice room, I guess. You know I’m related to the Grandmaster, right?”\n\n“No. I thought we’re not allowed to have relations.”\n\n“Grandmaster didn’t. His sister did and she brought me here.”\n\n“Where’s she now?”\n\n“I don’t know, I’ve never met her.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“I’d stay away from Garth if I were you,” she says suddenly. “I think he has it out for you.”\n\n“I think he does too,” you answer.\n",
  "page 147": "You sit at a circular table joined by the other members of the council. You see the familiar faces of Saric, Kassi, and a bandaged Mathers along with Cara, leader of the hunters, and Gilcrest, the village head. Cara’s dirty blonde hair rolls from the left side of her hood in a single braid like a snake. Gilcrest is dressed in brown robes, priestly garments from his previous life before the Empire took control. The six of you make up the council, tasked with defending the village and organizing fire strikes against Empire soldiers wandering too close.\n\n“The fact is, the latest raid was too risky. You brought the Imperial riders to our doorstep! One of our own was injured,” Gilcrest speaks, calmly, though passionately. His shaved head reflects light from the candles on the table.\n\n“It was well worth it,” Mathers answers. “One of my former contacts shared valuable information. Horne is the best assassin there is. Shame his wounds kept him from joining us the night of the confrontation… Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before the Empire finds us here. They have plans to level the entire forest.”\n\n“Ellehorn is massive. It’s too tall a task, even for the Empire,” Cara inputs.\n\n“I wouldn’t be too sure,” the voice of the green-haired man speaks. Saric pulls a parchment and rolls it open on the table. “A prototype for a new type of tool. A forest-leveler.”\n\nThe drawing shows a magical device of sorts, drawn from several angles. Some show it head on, others are the side view. There’s even a glimpse inside the device. It’s a series of small blades on a round track.\n\n“What are we looking at exactly?” Kassi asks.\n\n“It looks like a saw of sorts,” you say figuring out the item’s purpose. “I’m uncertain to how it’s powered, but it looks continuous, and uninhibited by a man’s fatigue.”\n\n“That’s right,” Saric says. “They are being mass-produced throughout the Empire and only take a matter of seconds to topple the thickest of tree trunks. Ellehorn is vast, but it’s only a matter of time until the entire forest is bare.”\n\n“If these are being mass produced, what can we do? It’s not as simple as burning a factory and destroying the prototypes,” Cara says.\n\n“Excellent point,” Saric answers. “I vote for relocation. Underground. I’m told there’s a place near the late King Aeric’s keep.”\n\n“And I suggest we move quickly. Based on the intel, the Empire will be here by mid-Summer.”\n\n“So soon,” Gilcrest comments, more to himself than to the others. “This has been our home for many years.”\n\n“It won’t be ours for much longer,” Mathers says.\n\n“Take a night to reflect. Tomorrow, we’ll vote on relocation,” Gilcrest closes the meeting.\n",
  "page 7": "A flurry of fists thump into your chest. You attempt to block, but each blow keeps you distracted from the next. Her foot follows the series of punches, sending you sprawling to the ground. Still balancing with her leg outstretched, the girl, Kassi, laughs at your misfortune.\n\n“It’s a good thing Brother Trevor is making you train more. You could use it.”\n\nUnanswering, you pull yourself up and raise your arms defensively. Still smiling, Kassi lunges forward. You cover your face with your hands and hug your elbows in tight to protect your torso. Still, somehow, her strikes find their mark. One left hook finds its way to your temple temporarily stunning you.\n\n“Give up,” she says, holding an aggressive stance.\n\n“Never,” you reply, still holding your defensive posture.\n\nShaking her head, she steps forward for another series of attacks. This time you’re ready for her. Covering your head and torso, you wait for her offense to begin. As she lets loose another combination, you drive your weight into her. One of your arms underhooks hers, and the other wraps around the far side of her neck. Shifting your hips below Kassi’s for leverage, you complete the “head ‘n arm” throw and land on top of her. Before she can recover, you toss the underhooked arm aside and press your head into the base of her arm, pinning it against the side of her neck. Connecting both hands together, you begin to squeeze. Your arm around Kassi’s neck and her own arm pressed against the other side cuts off her air flow.\n\n“Kassi, tap out,” a male voice echoes across the training mat. You look to see Brother Samuel, although you make sure to keep the choke first.\n\nShe struggles, gritting her teeth. She tries to strike, but in your dominant position her attack is ineffective. Eventually, her struggling begins to fade.\n\n“That’s enough, child,” Samuel says walking across the mat.\n\nYou release the choke and allow Kassi to sit up, or at least you allow her to. She lies on the mat unmoving.\n\n“She’s always been a stubborn one. Devoted, but stubborn,” Brother Samuel comments. He kneels down beside her unconscious body and closes his eyes. After uttering words you cannot comprehend, he places his palm on her forehead. Blue light softly glows from the small crevice between his palm and her head. Her eyes burst wide open, and she sits up suddenly.\n\n“Jerk. We were training, not fighting for real,” she addresses you.\n\n“I saw an opening and I took it,” you reply. “You leave yourself open during your attacks—”\n\n“That’s enough you two,” Brother Samuel interjects. “You’re both right. I think you should continue to train together. Kassi, you’re one of our top acolytes. It’s almost unheard of for someone your age to train at the intermediate level. You could teach a lot to our friend here. In return, you’ll get more experience with a physically stronger opponent.”\n\nYour face breaks into a wide grin at the implication you’re stronger than her. Brother Samuel turns your direction. “And you, the newest of the acolytes could stand to improve as well. Raw strength will only carry you so far. There’s always someone stronger.”\n",
  "page 146": "You knock on the door to Gilcrest’s hut, his being on the ground means there’s actually a wooden door. Being one of the first settlers in the village, Gilcrest’s hut was built before expanding upward, and even though he has the option to take one of the hanging structures, he opts for keeping his.\n\n“Door’s unlocked,” Gilcrest’s voice rings out.\n\nWith a sharp squeal, you swing the door open. Books line the walls of Gilcrest’s hut, and various maps hang between bookcases. Each map has pins with wire attached, a result of Gilcrest’s planning. You see the back of his shaved head as he studies a map opposite of the doorway, two hands clasped behind his back.\n\n“What can I do for you?” Gilcrest asks, not turning around.\n\n“I’d like to hear your thoughts on the relocation,” you say. “You’ve been here longer than the rest of the council members and can offer a unique viewpoint.”\n\n“Unique, perhaps,” the back of his head replies. “Unbiased, perhaps not.” Gilcrest turns to face you. “I am not a young man. I must admit leaving this place gives a bit of sadness. This place feels sacred.”\n\n“Does it feel sacred enough to die for?” you ask.\n\n“Not if I have a choice, but there are worse ways to go.”\n\n“Fair enough,” you say. “We are grateful for you taking us in, Kassi and I. No matter the decision tomorrow, I hope you know that.”\n\n“There are two types of people in the world now: brainwashed puppets of the Empire and fugitives. I’ll gladly welcome you, and more like you, in. Now if there’s nothing else you need, I ask that you leave me to my thoughts.”\n\n“Until tomorrow, Gilcrest,” you say, taking your leave.\n",
  "page 2": "When I reflect upon my childhood, mixed emotions rise. On one hand, I appreciate the strict devotion of the monks. They knew who they were, which is more than could be said for the average person. On the other hand, a sinister, underlying ideology tainted their religion; the monks would only accept infants without any worldly or familial experience.\n\nI imagined my arrival to the monastery to be a result of loving parents wanting a better life for me. It was a good lie to believe at a young age. The monks accepted me, even though I was much older than an infant. That fact alone made me different from my peers and hurled me straight to the bottom of the hierarchy. The lie I told myself about my parents was one of the things that kept me going.\n\nThe monks were zealous in their beliefs, not allowing impurities of the body and mind to affect their training. I’m grateful for the discipline instilled in me at a young age. It made things easier. Not that it was an easy life. Rising before the sun to train, only to spend the daylight hours training even more, wasn’t an easy life. Habits are hard to break and the monks broke all of mine early on. My training became much more than lessons in discipline; it became a way of life.\n",

Upon movement, the bodies breathe out at exactly the same time.\n\n“Form three!”\n\nThe bodies turn to their left and let loose a series of punches and kicks. All except one.

  "page 4": "“No.”\n\nYou stand to your feet, a bit wobbly, before Brother Trevor can inflict any more damage in your prone state. The act of defiance visibly angers him. The outline of his jaw clenches as he approaches. His arm winds back, and you raise your arms defensively...but the blow never arrives. You peel back your arms, slowly, to see why. His entire demeanor is different. The anger, so clearly shown on his face, is gone. Standing before you is a calm, stoic monk.\n\n“My temper is my vice. I must atone for straying from the path,” he says with a singular tone.\n\nAs you completely lower your defensive posture, he continues. “My vice does not excuse yours though. You lack discipline, and I’m assigning extra training sessions until you learn. Physical mastery without a trained mind is useless.”\n\n“Yes sir,” you reluctantly reply.\n\nMovement catches your eye from the doorway. A girl with bright blonde hair passes by carrying an armload of folded cloth.\n\n“Kassi!”\n\nThe girl stops at Brother Trevor’s call. She enters the room still carrying the neatly folded cloth. Her hair shines gold, only rivaled by her sparkling sapphire eyes. She’s about your age if you had to guess. Maybe one or two years older. You make eye contact. The connection makes you smile. She doesn’t return the gesture.\n\n“Yes, Brother?” she asks.\n\n“Kassi, you train with the advanced students. I want you to help bring this one up to speed,” Brother Trevor says motioning to you.\n\nHer face curls. “Aw, what did I do this time?”\n\n“You’re complaining. This is for your benefit as well. To teach is to learn.”\n\n“Fine,” she utters. Turning to you she adds, “Meet me here before sunrise.”\n",

I did it on purpose. I thought it’d be funny.”\n\n“Well it wasn’t,” Brother Trevor answers. “One may not reach enlightenment if they are focused on being funny, rather than being disciplined.”\n\nYou nod.\n\n“Instead of repreminding you, I have a better solution.” Your eyes begin to widen at your good fortune. They quickly melt once he continues. “You’ll be given extra training hours before sunrise and before you’re allowed to sleep. That should instill the forms within your practice. Now go before I add cleaning hours on top of that.”\n\nYou sprint out of the room so that Brother Trevor cannot make good on his warning. You’re moving so quickly that you don’t notice the girl in front of you. You both go flying to the floor, and the folded laundry she’s carrying scatters all over the floor.\n\n“Damn it!” she exclaims.\n\n“Sorry,” you mutter, helping her to her feet. “I’d watch your language if I were you. The monks don’t like bad words.”\n\n“I heard Brother Samuel say it once. More than once actually,” she replies, curling a strand of bright blonde hair behind her ear.\n\n“Me too. But he can get away with a lot more than me,” you say. “Hey, I didn’t see you training with us. How’d you get away with that?”\n\n“This,” she spreads her arms wide at the mess of clothing on the floor. “And I train with the advanced students.”\n\n“You do? Can you teach me?” you ask.\n\n“Help me with the laundry first and then ask me,” she replies.\n",

  "page 99": "The march continues up the mountain. The dull brown landscape is replaced with battalions of soldiers, each with their stained white-gold armor. Surrounding trees block your vision from the front of the march. The mood is solemn. Any man that’s experienced battle does not get cheerful when it approaches. These men are not recruits; these men are battle-hardened. The steady incline gradually decreases into a slight slope. Then, the trees break, revealing the castle. Across a narrow bridge lies King Aeric’s castle.\n\nSinister it sits, staring at the approaching soldiers. Its windows are dark and lifeless. It faces the bridge as if mocking the siege attempt. The castle rises high above the narrow pathway and harbors several levels for archers and ballistae. The march ceases, awaiting order from the Emperor himself to storm the gates.\n\nA cheer rises from the Empire’s troops. They part, allowing the object of their outcry pass through. Wyverns! An entire squadron of them. As far as you knew, they were extinct. Clearly that is not the case. Somehow the Emperor managed to breed a dozen of the flying beasts. The Emperor leads the group of wyverns, sitting atop the largest one.\n\n“Today is the day, my friends. The fortress before us has never been conquered. Its inhabitants have never known defeat, until this day. This is the day we do the impossible, together. Count yourselves lucky, men, the story of this battle will be told for generations, and its soldiers will be crowned heroes. Remember this day, men. To arms!”\n\nThe Imperial soldiers scream at their Emperor’s speech. They clash their swords against their shields and pound their spears into the dirt. The Emperor points his sword forward, and the soldiers start their march across the narrow bridge.\n",

The “carrier” is generally nimble and quick, relying on “guardians” to block for him. From your limited understanding of the game, there are different strategies involved including tight-knit groups designed for barreling through opponents. On the other hand, a mobile team can run circles around those types, provided they never face head-on. And, of course, there’s a mix of the two.\n\n“That’s right. Dodgey and I play as ‘guardians,’ blocking and paving the way for the “carrier,” Captain Wren. Big Sue is a “roamer,” adding support for us or extra firepower for Wren’s strike,” Rexxus says.\n\n“Makes sense. I imagine your equipment is special as well?”\n\n“Light leather, for mobility, reinforced I might add. Doesn’t block a blow like plate would, but sure makes thunder bolts less threatening,” Captain Rhen says. Motioning to his spear, he adds, “Weapons are lengthy. It’s hard enough getting within arm’s reach distance to a wizard. Piercing weapons work best, too. Magical protection spells are stronger against slashing.”\n\nYou nod, fully aware of that fact.\n\n“Satisfied at our readiness, my liege?” Big Sue asks.\n\n“That’s Commander Liege to you,” you retort.\n",

  "page 9": "The blindfold around your head prevents you from seeing your footing. You stand on a series of narrow wooden beams. The beams are lifted several feet from the ground. It wouldn’t be a fatal fall, but it’d definitely leave a mark.. Focusing your mind, you try to imagine the placement of each beam as you hop between them. Upon each successful landing, you let loose a series of strikes from the practice sword in your hand. As you’re no stranger to the balancing structure, you keep your mind highly aware of which beam you’re on. Not all the beams are separated evenly apart, and you’ve witnessed more than a couple unlucky acolytes misjudge their position. Your mind is focused on the task and—\n\n“Are you ready for the Grand Melee?” Kassi asks running up to you.\n\nYou lose your balance for a split-second and shakily bring your arms to a “T” shape to regain it. Realizing you’re broken from the meditative state, you remove the blindfold and hop down from the balancing beams.\n\n“You interrupted my practice,” you comment.\n\n“You wouldn’t be able to do that if it wasn’t for me teaching you,” she replies.\n\n“Fair enough.”\n\n“So...the Grand Melee is coming up. Do you know which event you’re entering?”\n\n“Not yet. What about you?”\n\n“Unarmed combat, of course. I won it last year.”\n\n“I didn’t enter last year,” you point out.\n\n“True. Enter it then. Unless you’re scared.”\n\n“Remind me again, what are the different categories?”\n\n“Unarmed combat, form mastery, and dueling.”\n\n“Tell me more about…”\n",
  "page 14": "“I’m going to enter the Unarmed Combat competition,” you say.\n\n“Your funeral,” Kassi replies. “Just don’t lose before I can teach you another lesson.”\n\nShe leaves you alone to practice. You slip the blindfold back on and pull yourself onto the beams. With each hop and technique you practice, you imagine facing an opponent in the unarmed competition. You imagine, specifically, each of your peers in front of you and their tendencies. Then, you imagine the counter. An overaggressive striker leaves himself open to a takedown. A grappler looks to grab hold of their opponent, best not to throw many kicks and give them an opening. Brawlers want to drag you into their chaotic mess. Similarly, a disciplined, but inexperienced, fighter might be lost in the chaos and forget their well-practiced techniques.\n\nYou lose yourself in the practice until a bell rings, signaling dinner, drawing you out from the trance.\n",
  "page 17": "“I think I’ll enter form mastery,” you say.\n\n“Ugh, why?” Kassi asks. “Nevermind. Good luck.”\n\nWith that, she leaves you alone. You slip the blindfold back on and hoist yourself to the beams. You leave the practice sword behind so you can focus on flowing through the forms. You pivot to the right, as if moving through water, and guide your arms to the proper blocking technique in the form. Then quickly you counter with a flurry of punches ending with left hook. The simplicity and sudden burst from the technique makes it a deadly combination.\n\nNext, you plant both feet down as if an unmoving tree. A slight bend in the knees gives your legs strength and balance. You cover your face with your fists and keep your elbows in, protecting your torso. Then, you move through the evasive weaving. Depending on your opponent\u0027s stance, the power blow will come from the left or right. It almost always comes from the limb that’s furthest away. Best to avoid the power side and dodge to the other.\n\nFinally, you end your session with an offensive manevour. You open with a spinning heel kick, using the momentum to carry you to the next strike: a flying knee. As the form relies on quick, powerful explosions, you lunge from beam to beam to keep in constant motion. The idea of the form is to always be in motion. The opponent will naturally see your movements at a certain speed. Once they’re lulled, you strike quick like a cobra searching for the fight-ending blow.\n",

Though the ground is still muddy, the Empire troops’ spirits are elevated by the mostly dry march. Battle horns ring through the camp, signaling the men for organization and movement.\n\nA man introduces himself to you as Captain Wren. “We are a special unit designed with taking down casters,” he says. “There’s four of us total. Myself, Dodgy, Rexxus, and Big Sue. We’ve been through more than enough action and look forward to being led by someone so close to the Emperor,” he adds with a salute.\n\n“I as well, Captain,” you reply. You look behind the lean captain at the rag-tag trio. The skinny man with the darting eyes you assume to be Dodgey. The other two are easily as distinguishable. Rexxus is a tanned, bald man built like an ox. Big Sue is portly and looks to have not shaved in years.\n\nYou walk up to the trio. “Glad to have you here, gentlemen. Follow my lead and we’ll live to bring more glory to the Empire. Even you, Dodgey,” you say, lightly slapping his arm.\n\n“I’m Big Sue!” he exclaims.\n\n“I’m Dodgey,” the portly man bellows.\n\n“Sure you are,” you answer, surprised. “I’m honored to lead you. I’ve heard stories of the famed Breakers. You’ve taken out more than your fair share of mages, priests, and sorcerers.”\n\n“And look good while doing it,” Big Sue says, using a sizeable knife to motion combing his hair back.\n\n“Do you have knowledge of how we work?” Rexxus inputs.\n",

The dull brown landscape is replaced with battalions of soldiers, each with their stained white-gold armor. Surrounding trees block your vision from the front of the march. The mood is solemn. Any man that’s experienced battle does not get cheerful when it approaches. These men are not recruits; these men are battle-hardened. The steady incline gradually decreases into a slight slope. Then, the trees break, revealing the castle. Across a narrow bridge lies King Aeric’s castle.\n\nSinister it sits, staring at the approaching soldiers. Its windows are dark and lifeless. It faces the bridge as if mocking the siege attempt. The castle rises high above the narrow pathway and harbors several levels for archers and ballistae. The march ceases, awaiting order from the Emperor himself to storm the gates.\n\nA cheer rises from the Empire’s troops. They part, allowing the object of their outcry pass through. Wyverns! An entire squadron of them. As far as you knew, they were extinct. Clearly that is not the case. Somehow the Emperor managed to breed a dozen of the flying beasts. The Emperor leads the group of wyverns, sitting atop the largest one.\n\n“Today is the day, my friends. The fortress before us has never been conquered. Its inhabitants have never known defeat, until this day. This is the day we do the impossible, together. Count yourselves lucky, men, the story of this battle will be told for generations, and its soldiers will be crowned heroes. Remember this day, men. To arms!”\n\nThe Imperial soldiers scream at their Emperor’s speech. They clash their swords against their shields and pound their spears into the dirt. The Emperor points his sword forward, and the soldiers start their march across the narrow bridge.\n",

  "page 150": "You sit at a circular table joined by the other members of the council. You see the familiar faces of Saric, Kassi, and a bandaged Mathers along with Cara, leader of the hunters, and Gilcrest, the village head. Cara’s dirty blonde hair rolls from the left side of her hood in a single braid like a snake. Gilcrest is dressed in brown robes, priestly garments from his previous life before the Empire took control. The six of you make up the council, tasked with defending the village and organizing fire strikes against Empire soldiers wandering too close.\n\n“The fact is, the latest raid was too risky. You brought the Imperial riders to our doorstep! One of our own was injured,” Gilcrest speaks, calmly, though passionately. His shaved head reflects light from the candles on the table.\n\n“It was well worth it,” Mathers answers. “One of my former contacts shared valuable information. Horne is the best assassin there is. Shame his wounds kept him from joining us the night of the confrontation… Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before the Empire finds us here. They have plans to level the entire forest.”\n\n“Ellehorn is massive. It’s too tall a task, even for the Empire,” Cara inputs.\n\n“I wouldn’t be too sure,” the voice of the green-haired man speaks. Saric pulls a parchment and rolls it open on the table. “A prototype for a new type of tool. A forest-leveler.”\n\nThe drawing shows a magical device of sorts, drawn from several angles. Some show it head on, others are the side view. There’s even a glimpse inside the device. It’s a series of small blades on a round track.\n\n“What are we looking at exactly?” Kassi asks.\n\n“It looks like a saw of sorts,” you say figuring out the item’s purpose. “I’m uncertain to how it’s powered, but it looks continuous, and uninhibited by a man’s fatigue.”\n\n“That’s right,” Saric says. “They are being mass-produced throughout the Empire and only take a matter of seconds to topple the thickest of tree trunks. Ellehorn is vast, but it’s only a matter of time until the entire forest is bare.”\n\n“If these are being mass produced, what can we do? It’s not as simple as burning a factory and destroying the prototypes,” Cara says.\n\n“Excellent point,” Saric answers. “I vote for relocation. Underground. I’m told there’s a place near the late King Aeric’s keep.”\n\n“And I suggest we move quickly. Based on the intel, the Empire will be here by mid-Summer.”\n\n“So soon,” Gilcrest comments, more to himself than to the others. “This has been our home for many years.”\n\n“It won’t be ours for much longer,” Mathers says.\n\n“Take a night to reflect. Tomorrow, we’ll vote on relocation,” Gilcrest closes the meeting.\n",

As the voices draw near, you hide in a nearby, luckily empty, hut. The footsteps pass, and you make for the wooden bridge, quickly and quietly. Most of the attention on Cara’s fallen body, you’re able to sneak from the outskirts of the village into the forest.\n\nPart of you wonders if this is the correct decision. You could always turn back and try to explain yourself. No. Turning back now, would only solidify your guilt in their mind. Only guilty people run, despite the conscious they listen to later. This is only temporary, you tell yourself. Once the dust settles, you’ll find Kassi. You know their likely destination, or at least the area: the territory around King Aeric’s castle. Not far from the monastery. You imagine they will come after you. You’re not unaware of the dark irony of the situation. Only their best hunter would be able to track you; their best hunter lies dead at your hands.\n\nNo, you can’t follow the villagers. You can no longer endanger those who you care about. You’re on your own now.\n\nYou trek through the forest until darkness settles in. You don’t dare light a fire for fear of attracting your pursuers. Coldness stings your bones as you hug your knees into your chest for warmth, rubbing your palms together for some feeling of heat. You’re no stranger to living on the road. You’re a stranger to traveling alone. There’s always been two of you. Kassi and you, never separated, a lifetime spent together. Now, you’ve left her. The night feels even more colder at the thought.\n\nPerhaps it is better this way. The next time the voice appears, taking over, it might be Kassi who lies dead on the ground. You mourn for Cara, but you can’t imagine if it were Kassi. That would be an unforgivable action, despite your choice in the matter. The fact is, you’re well aware of the voice, and it’s your choice who you surround yourself with. They are in danger because of you, because of your lineage. You had hoped through strict training, the voice would be silenced. It’s been getting worse your entire life, even if you do manage small victories time to time.\n\nNo, this is the best decision. You’ll not endanger those you care about. You’re prepared to live in solitude for their safety. This is not how you thought fate would play out, but your friends’, especially Kassi’s, well-being is far more important than your own.\n\nYou take a deep breath and exhale out into the night air. There are worse fates that can befall a man.\n",
  "page 153": "There’s really no choice in the matter. You aren’t one to shift the blame from one’s self. Despite not your actions, it’s by your hand that Cara lies dead. You doubt the others will want to hear the story behind. All they know is a woman is dead and you’re likely the one who caused it. The thought occurs to you, not a thought that you’re proud of, that you could simply say Cara fell, that it was an accident. The others would always suspect you, but do they really have any proof it was you?\n\nNo.\n\nYou cannot lie about such an event. You’re a man of your word, and by the same token you’d rather die with the truth than live a lie. Footsteps approach, steadily getting louder. This voice, whatever it is inside you, is the cause of many deaths, innocent or otherwise. Part of you wonders if siding with your allies really was the best choice. You’d choose them over anything, your actions displayed that, although you wonder if they are better off without you. The Unbroken blood, the thing Mathers told you about, rises within, taking over, spilling blood by your hands. You await your punishment.\n\nThey lead to you to village square, tied at the wrists and stripped of your tunic. Your bound hands are moored to a post, securing you like an animal. Men rush into buildings, gathering the council members and explaining the events that just transpired. Often they finish with pointing a finger directly at you. Then you see her. Kassi appears from behind a crowd of people. Her bright blonde hair cuts through the crowd of people like rays of sun through trees. She looks concerned and uncertain how to react.\n\nThe council members surround you. “Is it true?” Gilcrest asks.\n\n“It was my hand, yes,” you answer.\n\n“Why?”\n\nWhile thinking of a response, of a possible explanation, Mathers fills in. “He can’t control it. You’re looking at the last descendent of Ragar the Unbroken.”\n\n“And you did not think to tell us who was within our midst?” Gilcrest questions.\n\n“We thought his training suppressed the darkness.”\n\n“Obviously not. What am I supposed to do? He’s too dangerous to be kept alive. God forbid he bears children.” Gilcrest bends down to your level, gauging your intentions. “He is a man of character, despite the darkness within. I think we can all agree on that fact. Yet, he is a danger to us all.”\n\nShouts of “kill him!” rise from the crowd. Gilcrest silences them with a wave of his hand. Kassi remains quiet.\n\n“I can think of two options for such a crime. Death, the Unbroken line dying with you.” Gilcrest pauses to let the crowd finish their cries. “Or exile, with the mark of the Unbroken carved on your forehead. That way all who you meet will know exactly who you are and to stay away. As a man of character, I’ll let you decide your fate.”\n",
  "page 134": "You help some of the villagers with chores. It’s not a glamorous job, but you’ve never been one to shy away from hard work. Despite the events occurring in your life, the spotlight is never something you’ve sought after. It’s just the place you found yourself in, and you’ve acknowledged it for what it is. Still, chopping firewood in the cool morning air brings a small sense of satisfaction.\n\nEverything’s simpler. In the morning you either hunt or help with whatever needs done. Usually, it’s taxing on the body, lifting lumber or bolstering the village’s defenses. The latest project is digging a series of tunnels beneath the village in case of an attack. You’ve always been strong, your forms made sure of that. Your lean muscle has turned into a more hulking frame, not that you’ve lost dexterity because of it. Staying in one place with plenty of food and work has taken its effect on your body.\n\n“Think you could finish the job without stopping to feel your biceps every two seconds?”\n\nKassi walks up with an axe resting gently on her shoulder. “I could have been done with the entire pile by now.”\n\nYou reply grabbing her arm, squeezing her bicep. “That’s because you have nothing to stop and feel.”\n\nShe flashes a grin, then swings the axe toward your head. Ducking backward, you slide a few steps out of reach.\n“At least you’ve still got a little quickness.”\n\n“Either that or you’ve become slow.”\n\nYou barely move from the next attack. Kassi’s swing of the axe showers your face with a spray of fresh air, the head swinging mere inches away from your own.\n\n“Kass…come on now. Don’t tell me that upset you,” you say.\n\n“Upset? Pfft. Someone’s got to keep you on your toes out here. Can’t let you get rusty, especially since the Emperor’s still out there.”\n\n“I don’t know if we’ll get another chance,” you begin to say.\n\n“Stop right there,” Kassi cuts you off. “I’ll not let you give up on our life’s mission.”\n\n“I’m just saying if we don’t get another chance, we’ll have to live with that too. Life out here isn’t so bad.”\n“I’ll not abandon the fight just so I can die peacefully in my sleep,” Kassi says, walking off.\n\n“That’s not what I meant…” (sigh)\n\nShe doesn’t hear you.\n",
  "page 29": "The discipline instilled in me at a young age was the main force behind my success. Others, perhaps, were more naturally talented than I. Not to say I wasn’t gifted; I definitely felt suited for this life, but my unwavering devotion to the practice set me apart from others. There were times in my early life I wished for a different fate.\n\nLife is hard enough without constant physical stress. Each time those thoughts would rise, I would force myself back to my practice, back to my true being. The fact is, those thoughts were born of my lesser, weak-willed nature. My training is meant to suppress the weakness inside.\n\nSeth was not a father figure, at least not in the same way I viewed Brother Samuel. With Samuel, I could tell he had my best interests in mind. Seth’s motivations were unclear, though they mostly revolved around himself. I wonder if his influence guided me to a better path. If you do not understand the influence others have on your actions, you are like a ship without a navigator. I studied the actions and motivations of those around me and introspectively meditated on their affect. I do not allow impurities into my system and that includes the impure actions of others.\n",

Your prey lies in front of you, unaware of your presence. Keeping your eyes remained on the target, you draw the bowstring back, feeling the arrow feathers tickle your cheek. In an instant the arrow disappears from its nocked position and lands squarely in the neck of the buck.\n\n“You’re a natural. I can’t believe you’d never picked up a bow before coming here.”\n\nYou turn to see Cara, lead hunter of the village. Her dirty blonde hair, neatly tied back into a single braid, spills from the left side of her hood like a snake. A thin line of dirt is faintly visible on her cheek.\n\n“I never said that. I just feel a lot more comfortable with a sword in my hand,” you say. “Although I must say, I’m taking a liking to this.”\n\n“Nothing like your arrow landing true,” Cara says.\n\n“I wouldn’t go that far. Come on, help me with the carcass.”\n\nThe two of you head towards the fallen deer. You pull a knife from the back of your hip. You make a long incision from the neck down the deer’s front side to empty the unneeded organs. Your mind drifts to events from the past two years. The Empire eventually broke through King Aeric’s castle, the last remaining territory. Now, no one publicly opposes the Emperor’s rule.\n\nYou’ve found refuge with Saric’s contacts, misfits, refugees, and former soldiers who have taken to Ellehorn to hide from the Empire. They’ve created a small village in the trees, led by Gilcrest. If there’s ever a place you don’t want to be found, Ellehorn is it. Mathers’ organization is all but disbanded; the Imperial raids made sure of that. You’re unsure if Vishal is still carrying on with his “thorn in the side” business. The Emperor’s intel makes you think not. The latest ambush on an Imperial cargo transfer didn’t go well, and ended putting Mathers out of commission for a while, though you’re grateful her wounds didn’t end up being fatal.\n\n“Done!” Cara exclaims. The thin spot of dirt is joined with a few splashes of blood from the deer. “I’ll let you have the honor of dragging it back to camp. You did fell the ‘great beast,’ after all.” She holds her fingers out in a mocking gesture.\n\n“You speak highly for someone so empty handed,” you reply.\n\n“You make the task a lot more difficult, stomping around with those heavy footsteps of yours. It’s a wonder we found anything. I’m willing to bet this here buck has hearing problem.”\n\n“Had hearing problems,” you correct.\n\n“Close enough.

Inside the cover, your feet settle in\n\nHISSS\n\nand find cold, leathery-smooth skin. Instantly, you flip from the bedroll and peer inside. Darkness: the same that’s outside is all you find, an empty bedroll, still warm from your inhabitance. Taking a deep breath, you slide back inside and try to forget what just happened. You’re sure you felt something at your feet. As you re-settle in, your toes briefly touch, and for a second you imagine you feel it again, but…nothing.

  "page 138": "You rise early, before the sun even. The thick forest doesn’t allow you to view the sunrise very well, but there’s a clearing a short hike from the village that offers the best view. The clearing is your destination, as it is most mornings. Cool air fills your lungs as you trek through small animal trails. A song bird sings to your right, and as if a duet, another to your left, though it sounds far off in the distance. Rusting of leaves alerts you to a woodland creature scurrying off at your presence. You see a familiar Y-shaped tree, the trunk splitting into two separate branches. Another 100 steps or so, and you’re there.\n\nYou hear breathing before you see her. It’s like you’re kids again back at the monastery. It was Brother Trevor’s punishment that made you start rising early to train, but you and Kassi kept the habit going. You remember the times you beat her to the training room. She’d arrive shortly after, visibly disappointed for allowing you, or anyone, to beat her. Without a doubt, the next morning she’d be there first, never allowing two mornings in a row to take place. Through a break in the leaves, you peer through watching Kassi\u0027s form.\n\nShe moves intently, never wasting stamina in large sweeping motions. Each motion is deliberate as she shadowboxes an unseen opponent. She feints forward, attempting to pull her imaginary foe off balance, then quickly steps back at the same time throwing her counter.\n\n“It’s not polite to spy on a woman from the bushes,” she calls out into the morning.\n\nYou abandon your position and step into the clearing. “‘Spying’ suggests intentional deceit. I have nothing to hide.”\n\n“No, but you were hiding.”\n\n“Out of courtesy. I don’t mean to interrupt your practice.”\n\n“Now that you’re here, care to join?”\n\n“Of course. That’s why I’m here.”\n",
  "page 137": "Your hut sways comfortably in the night breeze, gently willing you, rocking you to sleep. Every few minutes, a strong burst rustles the leaves hanging around the structure. Softly, as if on a ship, the nearby bridge, suspended by rope, creaks with motion, then returns back to silence. Your simple bedroll invites you in, warms you like a mother’s arms. Inside the cover, your feet settle in\n\nHISSS\n\nand find cold, leathery-smooth skin. Instantly, you flip from the bedroll and peer inside. Darkness: the same that’s outside is all you find, an empty bedroll, still warm from your inhabitance. Taking a deep breath, you slide back inside and try to forget what just happened. You’re sure you felt something at your feet. As you re-settle in, your toes briefly touch, and for a second you imagine you feel it again, but…nothing. Whatever it was, a strange dream most likely, it’s gone now.\n",
  "page 139": "It’s like you’re children again. The forest clearing is filled with the sound of your footsteps and breath work. Abandoning your weapons, today you’re focusing on hand-to-hand combat and grappling. Your hands grip the back of Kassi’s neck as you throw light knees into her torso. She easily blocks the strikes with her forearms and twists from your grasp, smacking the back of your head with an open palm, holding back, but calling the blow \"gentle\" would be an understatement.\n\nWith a smile, and ever-so-slight intensity increase, you duck under your arms and tackle Kassi to the ground. She instantly wraps her legs around your waist to control your posture. Using one knee, you break the grip at her feet, prying her legs open and pinning one of her legs to the ground. One leg pinned, you easily slide past her guard and begin to isolate an arm, using both of your hands to interlace the joint lock. Gradually applying pressure, she eventually taps your shoulder signaling her surrender and unwillingness to suffer a broken arm in order to preserve her pride.\n\nBREAK IT\n\nYou obey the voice. You snap Kassi’s arm at the elbow joint and release the broken limb to the ground. She screams in pain and grabs for the injured arm. Horrified, you back up, keeping both arms raised displaying your intention to cause no further harm, but the damage is already done. Kassi’s face curls in pain and disbelief at your actions. You try to comfort her, but she kicks at you, wanting nothing to do with you.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nReality snaps back.\n\n“I tapped. You can release my arm now.”\n\nYou’re back holding Kassi’s uninjured arm, which you promptly release in fear of your vision becoming real.\n\n“Sorry,” you manage to mumble.\n\n“You’ve been acting strange lately. What’s going on?” Kassi asks.\n\n“I just lost myself for a moment there,” you answer.\n\n“Yeah, well, don’t let it happen again. Focus your mind. Remember your mantra,” Kassi instructs as if you’re a kid again.\n\n“Yes, Grandmaster,” you say, forcing yourself to smile.\n\nYou eat a playful punch to the gut in reply.\n",

What’s special about this?”\n\n“They’ll be judging every small detail. And they’ll make you answer questions too.”\n\n“That doesn’t sound like fun,” you comment.\n\n“Not as fun as fighting,” she replies. “Think you’ll enter?”\n",

  "page 24": "Brother Samuel hadn’t told anyone of the shade\u0027s appearance, except for the Grandmaster himself. Deep down, the shade’s interest in the boy frightened him. He had the feeling it wouldn’t be the last appearance to the boy. The boy’s past is a mystery, and ordinarily he would have been turned away from the monastery. Though he didn’t show it, Brother Samuel could tell the Grandmaster took special interest in the boy as well. Samuel knew the Grandmaster before he earned the title. Only the Master of Archives could share the same boast.\n\nBrother Samuel reaches his destination: the Grandmaster’s private study. The heavy oak door is reinforced with steel, barring unwanted entry. Samuel knows there are other deterrents to keep thieves or renegade monks out. He closes his eyes to focus on the seals. Magic flows from his open palms dispelling the deadly traps. He takes a coin from his pocket and looks at the door’s keyhole. He whispers into the coin, and the object transforms into a key. He unlocks the door and flips the key into the air. After several flips in the air, a coin lands into his open palm.\n\n“Still got it, old man,” he whispers to himself.\n\nThe door swings open revealing a room lined with bookcases. There isn’t a single bare wall. As his presence is detected, torches light up illuminating the entire room in their blue glow. Samuel places his cane on the center table and begins to search for the book he came for.\n\n“You shouldn’t be here,” a voice projects from behind him.\n\nBrother Samuel turns to see a white glowing light. The wisp, the Master of Archives, shines disapprovingly. Not many would be able to tell an approving shine versus a disapproving one, but Brother Samuel is not unaccustomed to the one before him.\n\n“You know I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important,” Brother Samuel replies.\n\n“Why not come with the Grandmaster? You are among the few he’s invited in,” the wisp answers.\n\nSamuel hesitates. He knows the wisp will relay his words and actions to the Grandmaster. “I’m searching for a tome on dark magic. Specifically, on the origins of shades. The Grandmaster is far too busy to help me look for a book.”\n\n“We have plenty of history books in the main library.”\n\n“This one is not among them.”\n\n“What makes you so sure?”\n\nSamuel takes a seat at the center table. He’d been standing too long without his cane. He breathes out an exhausted breath. “Because I’ve checked. I’ve spent years carefully working through all the volumes we have in the library. It’s not there.”\n\n“Very well, follow me. I shall inform the Grandmaster of your intrusion. No doubt, he will reprimand you for your actions. I am no guardian of knowledge. I exist to further it.”\n\nWhatever punishment the Grandmaster gave, it would be worth it. Brother Samuel rises from his seat and follows the wisp down the hall of books. The white glow from the Master of Archives, in combination with the blue torch light, casts sinister-looking shadows from angles of differently shapen books. The two arrive at a small section of the bookcase wall. The Master of Archives circles in the air for a moment and then flies directly into the wall. The light vanishes instantly, leaving Brother Samuel alone in the blue.\n\nBrother Samuel stands still for a few moments and then begins to feel uneasy. The thought pops into his head that the wisp could have let him into a trap. He checks the hallway for movement. Nothing. Suddenly, the bookcase swings open and Samuel is face to face with the wisp.\n\n“It’s a lot harder to open a doorway without arms,” the wisp says.\n\nBrother Samuel frowns. “I don’t remember you being funny. Maybe this is a trap,” he comments.\n\nThe Master of Archives ignores him and flies down the dark staircase. Brother Samuel does his best to follow quickly. The narrow staircase leads into an even narrower hallway and finally to an open room. Several single-bodied cells are against the sidewalls. Samuel gulps and tries to ignore them. The wisp leads him through rows of cells before arriving at a series of pedestals, five of them arranged around a summoning circle.\n\n“The tome is here?” he asks.\n\n“In a manner of speaking,” the wisp replies. “Approach the middle pedestal.”\n\nBrother Samuel does as he’s instructed. On top of the pedestal lies an open scroll. Samuel instantly recognizes the spell’s intent. “By the light, I’m to call him to this plane?” he wonders aloud.\n\n“Such knowledge is too dangerous to be written.”\n\n“And summoning the dead isn’t?” Samuel retorts. “Very well. If this is the only way.”\n\nBrother Samuel silently reads the scroll, softly moving his lips as if pronouncing the words. Satisfied at his ability, he speaks the incantation. Nothing happens and he repeats it again. Still nothing. Finally, he shouts the incantation.\n\nBlack mist begins to swirl at the circle’s center. It begins low and then slowly builds in density and rotation. As quickly as it appeared, the mist dissipates. A lone figure hunches in the summoning circle: Ragar the Unbroken. His skin loosely hangs from his bones, completely absent in many places. The few strands of black hair that haven’t fallen out completely dangle near the edge of his shoulders. The left side of his mouth is completely rotted away.\n\n“Why have you called me from the abyss?” Ragar snarls.\n\n“I seek knowledge on shades,” Brother Samuel answers. “Knowledge that even the lowliest necromancer would have.”\n\n“Shades! Don’t insult me, monk. I have no love for petty sorcerers, but even less for devotees of the light.”\n\n“You will tell me the knowledge I seek,” Samuel commands. He holds out his arm in focus. Blinding light fires from his open palm searing Ragar’s cheek. Ragar grimaces in pain and attempts to resist. The magic seals surrounding the summoning chamber amplifies the divine magic. The ray from Samuel’s palm grows brighter.\n\n“Tell me what I seek!” Samuel shouts.\n\nA piercing screech projects from the summoned spirit echoing throughout the room. The intensity grows with the ray’s brightness. Suddenly, the spirit collapses. The screech, now silent, leaves behind a soft ringing in Samuel’s ears.\n\n“Very well,” Ragar the Unbroken utters. “Ask your accursed questions and release me.”\n\n“I’ve crossed paths with a shade and—”\n\n“Then you’re lucky to still be alive, monk,” Ragar interrupts.\n\nSamuel warns him with a look and continues. “Shades are the spirits of the dead in possession of a living being. Is there a reason a shade would be interested in another being? A boy.”\n\n“It is not uncommon for the spirit to search for a more powerful host. There is a fine line between choosing to possess a strong host, and being destroyed in the attempt. If the spirit grows too ambitious, they may find themselves facing a being too powerful. That’s why shades primarily inhabit sorcerers who overstep in their search for powerful magic.\n\n“I came across a boy being pursued by a shade.

Release me, monk, I have answered all of your questions,” Ragar the Unbroken replies.\n\n“I am not finished with you yet,” Samuel begins to reply.\n\n“Oh, but you are finished,” Ragar the Unbroken cuts him off.\n\nIt’s at that moment Brother Samuel notices a break in the summoning circle. Ragar the Unbroken strides through the magic seals, gazing intently on Samuel. The monk begins to draw on the magic infused in his cane, but Ragar is quicker. Shadow magic fills the air cutting Brother Samuel’s ability to breathe. The magic hangs heavy as if the monk is dragged further and further underwater.\n\nRagar fires a shadow bolt directly at Brother Samuel’s chest. Unable to move in time, Samuel closes his eyes preparing for the end and...nothing. He blinks his eyes open to find a hooded figure beside him.\n\n“Fool!” the Grandmaster shouts while maintaining the protective shield around the two. The medallion around his neck emits a bright white light.\n\nRagar the Unbroken fires several more shadow bolts towards the monks. Each is absorbed through into the shield. Brother Samuel sees the Grandmaster’s eyes squint slightly in concentration, then his eyes turn the same pure white emanating from the medallion. The Grandmaster expertly weaves his arms forward. The energy absorbed into the shield begins to redirect into a ball firing straight towards Ragar. The blast explodes into the wall sending chunks of rock to the floor.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ragar the Unbroken is nowhere to be seen.\n\n“Is he dead?” Brother Samuel asks.\n\n“Yes, for centuries,” the Grandmaster replies.\n\nBrother Samuel’s gaze meets the Grandmaster’s gray eyes. “I’m sorry. I had to know,” he breaks the silence.\n\nThe Grandmaster places his hand on Samuel’s shoulder. “My friend, I do not blame you for seeking truth. You were foolish to seek it alone. Come, we will speak on this later. The king’s emissaries will soon be arriving for the Grand Melee.”\n",

  "page 28": "Chaos. The portal takes you into the monastery’s courtyard. Arriving, you quickly dodge from a flying spear. The bodies of the invading soldiers are beginning to completely cover the courtyard floor. You breathe a sigh of relief when you don’t see any fallen monks. The monks appear to be fighting well, but the sheer number from the mountainside is too many to count.\n\nThrough the doorway to the main hallway, you see Kassi engaged with several soldiers. Their armor is nowhere as neat as Seth’s, if you could call it armor. It\u0027s more like rags, with some areas of reinforced leather, than actual armor. The long hair and unkempt beards of the invading soldiers make them seem more animal than man. They fight with the same savagery that you’ve seen in your encounters with woodland creatures surrounding the monastery.\n\nNot wasting any time, you rush towards Kassi picking up a scimitar from one of the savages. Solely focused on Kassi, you impale the closest invader from the back. The sudden rush of blood and fallen ally alert the others of your presence. Savages on either side of you swing their swords at your head almost simultaneously. Dedicated to your training, you instinctively bend your torso backwards. Two blades fly harmlessly overhead. Recovering upright, you slash one’s throat and gouge a deep cut through the other’s chest. Now that you’ve drawn the attention of the others, Kassi picks them apart one at at time. She’s only armed with a small dagger, and you realize she’s fighting as if unarmed, the dagger striking the killing blow.\n\n“Are you ok, Kass?” you ask.\n\n“You’re seriously asking me that? Don’t forget who taught you everything you know,” she says confidently.\n\n“Ok, sorry I asked. What should we do?”\n\n“I saw Brother Trevor and Seth head towards the library. If anyone knows what to do, it’s them.”\n\nYou make your way through the hallways, fighting off soldiers whenever they come near. Though you are well younger, the soldiers fight with little technique. Their swords moves as if through water. You stick to your training and finish most with a single counter. A slight redirection of their sword leaves them vulnerable to the killing blow. You do not hesitate, even though it is your first time in real combat. You do as you are trained.\n\nAfter several turns, you arrive to the library\u0027s double doors. The library is normally kept spotless, but the inside looks like a hurricane hit the room. Books, bookcases, and bodies cover the floor. In the center of it all, you see Seth. King Aeric’s emissary appears to be unfazed by the battle and fights alone, no monks by his side. His red armor looks freshly made still, and then you realize the entire robe is blood-soaked; it’s just hidden in the red color. His twin short swords work magnificently together. They glide through the air removing limb and whole heads for those who get too close. He notices you and Kassi and begins to fight his way down toward you.\n\nArriving near you, and still fighting off several enemies, he shouts. “There are too many of them. We must regroup at Aeric’s keep. Gather all who you can and let’s flee this place.”\n\n“No, we will not abandon our home,” Kassi states.\n\n“There’s no time to argue, girl! Let’s go!”\n\nSeth begins to whisper into a ring on his finger and punches his fist to the ground. Waves of flame fire from the position and sweep into the surrounding soldiers. Kassi screams at the collateral damage. The books in the area instantly light up and the fire begins to spread. With the fire spreading, you exit the library following Seth.\n\nSeth leads you back through the hallways, although in the opposite direction of the courtyard. After a series of twists and turns you end up in the meditation sanctuary. Rows of mats line the open room. A sizeable shrine sits in the center, covered with religious trinkets and sacred flowers. There are no signs of the battle here. Seth walks up to the shrine and examines it.\n\n“I never enter a building without an escape plan. Ah, here we are,” he comments.\n\nSeth bends one of the candlesticks near the shrine sideways and pulls another towards him. As he stands back, a low rumble begins from the shrine. Scraping heavily, the top of shrine starts to move to the side. You can see a short staircase from where the shrine used to lay, leading to an underground passageway.\n\n“We must make for King Aeric. If the western border has collapsed, we must inform him,” Seth says jumping down. “Come with me. It’d be best to have monk acolytes accompany me to answer any questions.”\n\n“We can’t just leave. The others need us,” Kassi replies.\n\n“All is lost. We can only hope to avenge them. If you decide to stay, you will be choosing death.\n\n“I’m not going,” Kassi firmly states.\n\n“What about you?” Seth asks. “Answer quickly, we haven’t much time.”\n",
  "page 27": "The day of the Grand Melee has finally arrived. The weeks since your talk with Kassi has been spent preparing for this day. The event takes place on a nearby mountainside. Halfway up the rocky slope, a section of the mountain jettisons out as if the top portion was cut cleanly off. The result is flat-topped overhang, which overlooks the surrounding hills. Many monks trek to the area for prolonged meditation, but today it was meant for combat.\n\nA lifted stage lies in the center of the plateau. The structure is built to be a little smaller than the practice room mats. The stage stands several feet from the ground and has no railing. In each of the melee’s categories, if you fall, you’re automatically disqualified. You stand next to Kassi in the ready room, although it’s more a roped-off enclosure than room.\n\n“Who’s that next to the Grandmaster?” you ask her.\n\nNext to the hooded elder stands a man dressed in an armored dark red robe.The crimson robe is reinforced with light plate in several key areas. A sizeable, yet nimble, breastplate is attached to his front and back torso. His shoulders are protected by layered pieces of metal. There doesn’t appear to be any armor from his waist-down, with movement prioritized over raw protection. Two short swords hang on his back. Brother Samuel stands near the two. He notices your stare, and gives a friendly wink.\n\n“That’s the king’s emissary,” she replies. “You don’t know about the emissary?”\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n“During every melee, the King sends a man to scout for warriors. Once a year, one of us is recruited to serve the King.”\n\n“He taking one of us?” you ask.\n\n“Of course. The King protects our borders and in return we help protect him.”\n\n“I didn’t know that,” you comment.\n\n“You haven’t been here long. Don’t worry, he only takes the top warrior. You’ll be with us for life,” she answers.\n\nYou reply with a nasty, but playful look.\n\nMovement catches your eye. Your gaze is drawn to center stage where Brother Trevor begins the announcements.\n\n“Welcome brothers. The time of the Grand Melee is upon us. This is a time where we put our disciplined training to the test. Without trial, we cannot fully understand our strength. The good King Aeric has sent his man, Seth, to observe our progress. This is a time where—”\n\n“Fire!” a monk near the plateau’s edge yells.\n\nThe cliff’s edge becomes crowded as the mountain’s inhabitants rush for a viewing spot. From within the monastery\u0027s eastern wall, a pillar of smoke rises through the air. Like ants spewing from an anthill, soldiers pour over the surrounding hills charging towards the monastery. Large flaming projectiles fly in the air, their siege constructs hidden by the hills.\n\n“Is this the ‘protection’ King Aeric offers?” one of the younger members questions.\n\n“Quiet yourself,” the Grandmaster interjects. “We have not been overrun in a thousand years. I’ll not allow it to happen now.”\n\nThe Grandmaster steps to the very edge of the cliff. The mountain wind carries his robe as if a cape behind him. His arms move through the air as his lips speak the spell into existence. An outline of a door appears just off the cliff’s edge.\n\n“Step through the portal. We must protect our home,” the Grandmaster directs. “Lucky for us, King Aeric’s emissary is here to help.”\n\nOne by one, the monks step out over the cliff into the portal. The way their bodies disappear reminds you of dropping a rock into a pond. Seth walks to the portal with his hands on his hips shaking his head. You could imagine his thought: “today of all days...”\n\nFinally it gets to your turn. You begin to step forward and feel a hand stop you. You turn to find Brother Samuel.\n\n“This day has come sooner than I expected, child,” he speaks.\n\n“What do you mean?” you inquire.\n\n“Since I brought you in, I knew you were not destined to live a solitary life. I never did tell you about the night I found you.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\nYou see his face darken, even more than the surrounding monks who were off to battle.\n\nHe speaks in a softer tone. “Great evil follows you. I thought you’d be safe here. I don’t know why it wants you, but it’s coming.”\n\n“I— I don’t understand,” you manage to say.\n\n“You don’t have to understand. Stick to your training, and it will guide you through. Now go! We must defend the monastery.”\n\nOn his final words, Brother Samuel gives you a gentle nudge towards the portal. Hundreds of feet in the air, you take in your surroundings. The hills in front are littered with soldiers. Smoke rises now from several locations in the monastery, your home. There is but one path in front of you.\n",
  "page 20": "“I’m going to enter the dueling competition,” you say.\n\n“Good luck. Garth usually wins that, and he doesn’t like you,” Kassi replies.\n\nShe leaves you to finish your training session. You grip your training sword firmly in your palm. The wooden longsword could be used with one hand or both. You admire the versatility of the weapon. Shields are too bulky for your style, though you respect the classic combination of offense and defence. You imagine your chances of winning are high if you get a sword in your hand. Even a staff would be fine, you are mostly worried about getting something unconventional like a flail or whip.\n\nThen you realize you don’t even know which weapons will even be included in the competition. You focus on your basic techniques, the universal truths that apply to any weapon wielded, such as limiting your motion with the weapon. Wood is light, but wielding real metal can easily tire oneself out. Unnecessary movements may capture the eye, but they’re not sustainable in a long battle.\n\nYou lose yourself in the practice until the dinner bell brings you from the trance.\n",
  "page 0": "In a monastery deep in the mountains, Brother Samuel mulls over the scattered parchments on his desk. The lone candle in the center offers little light, but Samuel is used to reading in such circumstances. The mug of mead helps with eye-strain, at least that’s what he told himself. Earlier in life Samuel might have complained at the project in front of him, but with age comes a sense of responsibility along with a greater appreciation for tasks that didn’t stress his aching joints.\n\nBrother Samuel lifts the mug to his mouth only to discover the contents empty.\n\n“Bah, one of these days I’m going to get a bigger cup,” he mutters to himself and rises from his seat.\n\nAs he moves, his plain robe sways in the air as if drapes hung over an open window. With one hand around the mug, and the other grasping his walking cane, he exits the monestary’s library. The simple gray stones lining the hallway appear black, except for the small area around the lit torches, not that Brother Samuel required sight to navigate his way around. The silence of the night is disturbed by the steady tap, tap, tap of his wooden cane on the stone floor.\n\nSamuel enters the kitchen to discover it’s not empty. A young girl with bright blonde hair is on the floor with a bucket and rag. She scrubs at the floor, purposefully, ensuring every inch of the floor is spotless.\n\n“Child, what are you doing? It’s the middle of the night,” Samuel asks.\n\n“Brother Trevor said I need to scrub every inch of the kitchen to atone,” she answers.\n\n“Brother Trevor can lick a slug. Children need their sleep,” Samuel replies.\n\nShe girl laughs. “Ew!”\n\n“What are you atoning for?”\n\n“Complaining.”\n\nBrother Samuel begins to answer when he hears a noise from outside. Was it from within the monastery walls? No, the sudden crash wasn’t muffled or distorted at all. It had to have originated in the open air. The girl hasn’t returned to scrubbing, which means she heard it too; it wasn’t just the mead.\n\n“Go back to bed, girl. I’ll handle Brother Trevor in the morning,” Samuel quietly speaks.\n\nShe nods and leaves the kitchen. Brother Samuel places his empty mug on the counter and heads to the outside door. This time, he walks upright without the use of the cane. The open night air stings Brother Samuel’s wrinkled skin. The full moon illuminates the surrounding grassy hilltops. Trees sprinkled on the slopes cast dark shadows, creating pockets of darkness. No bandit had come close to the monastery in years. Even criminals were smart enough to keep their distance. If they weren’t, they learned quickly. Subtle movement on the hill catches his eye. The night air suddenly felt much colder.\n\nDrawing on a lifetime of training as well as several cups of mead, Brother Samuel calmly walks towards the movement. Nearing the origin of the movement, Samuel suddenly feels the presence of someone, or something. Then he sees it. A boy lies collapsed in the grass. His clothes are tattered and several deep scratches line his arms and legs. His skin appears dark, although closer observation reveals it to be dirt.\n\nBrother Samuel approaches the boy to check for signs of vitality. His fingers check for a pulse. It’s there, but barely. As Samuel leans to pick the boy up, a chill runs down his spine. He feels another’s presence. Samuel slowly brings his gaze up in front of him. A figure, masked in shadowy wisps, stands unmoving before him. Two crimson eyes peer through the darkness directly on Samuel.\n\n“You’ll not harm the boy, shade,” Brother Samuel speaks. He activates the divine magic seals on his cane for emphasis. The wood begins to emit holy light infusing its strength through Brother Samuel’s body.\n\nThe shade doesn’t react. Then Samuel begins to hear a slow, resonating laugh. The laughter isn’t audible, it feels as if it originates and echoes within Samuel’s head. In a swirl of black mist, the shade vanishes into the night. The mocking laugh begins to slowly subside within Samuel’s head. Samuel scoops his arms under the unconscious boy and lifts him from the ground.\n\n“You’re safe now, child,” he whispers to you.\n",
  "page 141": "You sit at a circular table joined by the other members of the council. You see the familiar faces of Saric, Kassi, and a bandaged Mathers along with Cara, leader of the hunters, and Gilcrest, the village head. Cara’s dirty blonde hair rolls from the left side of her hood in a single braid like a snake. Gilcrest is dressed in brown robes, priestly garments from his previous life before the Empire took control. The six of you make up the council, tasked with defending the village and organizing fire strikes against Empire soldiers wandering too close.\n\n“The fact is, the latest raid was too risky. You brought the Imperial riders to our doorstep! One of our own was injured,” Gilcrest speaks, calmly, though passionately. His shaved head reflects light from the candles on the table.\n\n“It was well worth it,” Mathers answers. “One of my former contacts shared valuable information. Horne is the best assassin there is. Shame his wounds kept him from joining us the night of the confrontation… Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before the Empire finds us here. They have plans to level the entire forest.”\n\n“Ellehorn is massive. It’s too tall a task, even for the Empire,” Cara inputs.\n\n“I wouldn’t be too sure,” the voice of the green-haired man speaks. Saric pulls a parchment and rolls it open on the table. “A prototype for a new type of tool. A forest-leveler.”\n\nThe drawing shows a magical device of sorts, drawn from several angles. Some show it head on, others are the side view. There’s even a glimpse inside the device. It’s a series of small blades on a round track.\n\n“What are we looking at exactly?” Kassi asks.\n\n“It looks like a saw of sorts,” you say figuring out the item’s purpose. “I’m uncertain to how it’s powered, but it looks continuous, and uninhibited by a man’s fatigue.”\n\n“That’s right,” Saric says. “They are being mass-produced throughout the Empire and only take a matter of seconds to topple the thickest of tree trunks. Ellehorn is vast, but it’s only a matter of time until the entire forest is bare.”\n\n“If these are being mass produced, what can we do? It’s not as simple as burning a factory and destroying the prototypes,” Cara says.\n\n“Excellent point,” Saric answers. “I vote for relocation. Underground. I’m told there’s a place near the late King Aeric’s keep.”\n\n“And I suggest we move quickly. Based on the intel, the Empire will be here by mid-Summer.”\n\n“So soon,” Gilcrest comments, more to himself than to the others. “This has been our home for many years.”\n\n“It won’t be ours for much longer,” Mathers says.\n\n“Take a night to reflect. Tomorrow, we’ll vote on relocation,” Gilcrest closes the meeting.\n",

  "page 143": "Like your hut, Cara’s is one of the hanging variety. You travel up the spiral ramp built around one of the tree trunks, crossing a few of the wooden bridges to reach it. Since there is no door to knock on, you call out, “Cara!”\n\nHer head pokes through the canvas door. “Oh, it’s you. Come on in.”\n\nInside the small hut, Cara’s bow leans against the corner wall, her leather quiver in front. Pure white feathers stick out from the opening, extending from the arrow shafts. Her bedroll is in the opposite corner of the bow, strangely enough, as you wouldn’t dare sleep that far from your weapon. Then again, Cara’s bow is more a tool, a means to provide food, rather than weapon of war. A few strands of hair fallen loose from the braid hang at her cheek as Cara looks at you, expectantly.\n\n“You’re probably wondering why I’m here,” you say. “I’m interested to hear your thoughts on the relocation. As someone so well versed in the forest, living underground can’t sound too enticing.”\n\nShe gazes from the open window, overlooking the entire village. You join her, peering out from the window. You can see almost every hut from here. The buildings on ground level look miniature, like a child’s play toy.\n\n“I must admit, I’m not thrilled by the idea,” she says. “I mean, look at this view! What would we be trading it for? A dark view of dark rocks?”\n\n“It’s safe at least,” you answer. “A dark view of dark rocks is better than no view at all.”\n\n“Is it?” Cara questions.\n\n“Depending on the person,” you clarify.\n\n“That’s just it. I don’t know\n\nHISSS\n\nif it’s worth it for me. The forest is my home. I’m happy here. I love walking through the trees, feeling the same breeze that rustles the leaves. Plus, the hunt. I’ve never felt so alive. There’s nothing quite like tracking a beast, seeing their prints, reading the forest’s clues on which direction the prey lies. I was born for this.”\n\nAND WOULD YOU DIE FOR IT\n\n“And would you die for it?” you ask.\n\n“I don’t know. Probably,” Cara answers.\n\nTHAT CAN BE ARRANGED\n\nThe voice appears from your mouth, otherworldly, sinister. Cara turns, facing you to see the disruption at your words. Your hands grab her shoulders, gripping them tightly, fingernails digging into her skin. In a single motion, you throw Cara against the hut wall. The entire structure shakes in the impact, beginning to sway side to side. A lifeless laugh escapes your lips as you stomp towards the collapsed woman.\n\nShe rises to her knees and begins to crawl towards the bow, but you catch her first. Your foot presses into Cara’s back, flattening her to the floor. With one hand, you grip around her throat and lift Cara into the air. Step. You walk towards the open window. Step. Cara’s eyes meet yours, afraid, confused by the actions of the man she thought she knew. Step. Your grip tightens, restricting the air flow of her breath.\n\nThe miniature buildings below call to you. They call for a worthy sacrifice. Fortunately, you possess just that.\n",
  "page 142": "You find Kassi in the stables. The stables are little more than a row of beams separating the horses into sections, covered by a simple roof. Kassi, brushing her mare, looks up at your arrival.\n\n“What are your thoughts on relocating?” you ask.\n\n“I’m all for it,” she answers, attention going back to the mare.\n\n“Really? I imagined you would put your foot in the ground to stay and fight,” you say.\n\n“I’m a warrior, not an idiot,” Kassi replies. “I’ll not willingly trap myself in Ellehorn. Besides, we’ve been on the move our entire lives. What’s one more relocation?”\n\n“Fair enough,” you answer. As you turn to leave, Kassi stops you.\n\n“Whatever the decision is, we’ll stand together.”\n\nYou nod. “Always.”\n",
  "page 167": "Seth hasn’t steered you wrong yet. True, he isn’t a typical role model – he breaks far too many rules to call him that, but his loyalty and devotion is unwavering. Those, truly, are what you try to imitate. His actions may be questionable at times, but his character never is. Still, you understand your role. Seth is the teacher and you are the student. It is your duty to follow his instruction – and leadership. You finish training by meditating on the task ahead, visualizing the upcoming battle.\n\nOnce night falls, you return back to the training grounds and find Seth along with others.\n\n“Glad you could make it,” Seth whispers. “There’s a window of sorts that’s our way out. Hope you enjoy a good climb.”\n\nYou follow him through the castle hallways, tip-toeing, moving as quiet as dozens of men can. The south end of the castle faces sheer mountainside. Your way out isn’t really a way out; it’s more like a fool’s errand and Seth confidently writes it at the top of his “to do” list. One of the men with you has knowledge of various traps along the way and disables them with ease. The “window” looks more like an empty doorway. If not for the deadly traps along the way, you’d think the opening to be an accident waiting to happen.\n\nYou peer out the opening to view the landscape. It’s too dark to see the ground. While extremely high up, you can see jagged pieces of rock sticking out from the mountainside serving as natural hand-holds. One by one, members of the raiding party cautiously lower themselves out the window.\n\n“Good thing it’s dark, otherwise this’d be a terrifying view,” someone beside you comments. The wind takes most of his words away from you. You find it’s not a difficult climb as long as you preserve your energy. Not knowing how far you needed to go is reason enough to save your strength. The unknown enemy below only adds to it.\n\nEverything seems to be going fine and then a piece of rock crumbles from the mountainside, sending one of the men screaming to his death below. He desperately reaches out for a hand-hold or someone to catch him. His hand finds your shoulder, pulling you from the rock. After several seconds, your body hits the ground. You don’t feel a thing.\n",
  "page 200": "It comes again, harder this time. You lower the mental defenses that you’ve spent a lifetime building up.\n\nKILL THEM ALL\n\n“Kill them all!” you shout. The men cheer at your command and rush through the gates. Their charge meets waiting white and gold, crashing into their defensive posture and ripping through their ranks. Through the mix of steel and bone, you remain focused on the inner gate to the keep. The soldiers are but a nuisance in your way.\n\nYour mouth opens, and a piercing scream emits. The world before you turns a dark, primal color as you take the role of hunter. Strength pours into your limbs unlike anything you’ve felt before. Not even the training “unlocking” the Unbroken feels like this. It’s exhilarating, like pure nirvana. With your heightened senses, you view the battlefield before you with clarity. It’s as if you know the exact outcome of each action before it happens. You start to shout commands to your men and then...\n\nSilence.\n\nThe words don’t appear. A sickening feeling appears through the rush of power. You feel it deep within your consciousness, yours, not the Unbroken controlling your body. You’ve simply become the vessel in which the dark power lives, a puppet to the Unbroken.\n\nDark energy materializes at your hands as the Unbroken tosses your sword aside, letting it clang harmlessly on the courtyard floor. Dark purple flames extend from your palms, solidifying, becoming translucent weapons, an axe in one hand and a sword in the other. With a supernatural leap, the Unbroken is whirlwind of shadowy sword and axe. The otherworldly weapons tear into Imperial soldiers\u0027 armor with ease. Each kill entices the Unbroken to greater heights of zeal, cutting down the Empire with vigor and thirst.\n\nYou see your men hesitate to draw near as they can clearly tell you’re acting differently. The dark form of Lorthander watches with interest. Then you see him. The Emperor. He sits atop his wyvern, peering over the war-torn capital city from the next fortress tier. His pauldrons curve up in a crescent moon shape, flickering sunlight, matching the gold mask covering his face. You will your body to move, but it doesn’t. The Unbroken is in command.\n\nThrough the eyes of the Unbroken, through your physical eyes, the world turns red, focused on a single target, the Emperor. The summoned weapons at your hands disappear as your body comes into a full sprint. Another supernatural leap takes you to the fortress’ walls. Like a four-legged beast, you climb on all fours, traversing the vertical wall. The Unbroken climbs with frightening speed, unnaturally, like a lion closing in on his prey. Another leap takes you atop the Emperor’s wyvern. Immediately, the Emperor summons a sword, similarly to the way the Unbroken did.\n\n“False king,” your mouth lifelessly speaks. “Your simple parlor tricks may fool the common soldier, but they don’t fool me.”\n\n“Such power lies within your blood,” the voice behind the golden mask speaks. “You are not a worthy vessel. I am the true Unbroken!”\n\nThe Emperor grabs for the amulet at his neck, and even though its been decades, you recognize it. The Grandmaster’s amulet. At the same time, the Emperor’s wyvern jumps into the air, flapping its leathery wings. You’re taken higher in the air. Wind rushes into your face, stinging your eyes, drying them with the sudden burst. Down below, the clashing armies are but insects, two waves of color molding into one. The Unbroken raises a palm and clamps your fist shut.\n\nThe air around the Emperor’s hand fills with a dark purple cloud. Sizzling, like meat on a stovetop, starting around his hand. The flesh around the Emperor’s hand rapidly decays, deteriorating, swept away like soft bark in a hurricane. He screams and loses hold of the amulet, letting it fall from his grasp down to the ground below. The Emperor regathers himself, and lets loose a shadow bolt towards you.\n\nThe bolt squarely hits your chest. Every instinct in your body screams for movement, to dodge, to evade the magic, but you’re no longer in control. Instead of tearing a hole through your chest, the shadow bolt hits your chest and fades like a drying puddle.\n\n“Did you really think your imitations would stand up against the real thing?” the Unbroken speaks.\n\n“You will not take everything I’ve built! I created the Empire and it’s only through me the free lands have been conquered,” the voice behind the mask shouts.\n\nYou realize the scenery below is different. Instead of the battlefield below, the wyvern’s flight has taken you far from the capital city and towards the Moon Bluffs. Blue water stretches as far as you can see. Green-tipped cliffs overshadow the liquid body like a tall tree on a sunny day. Waves crash against the rocky slope in small explosions of white foam.\n\n“History will not forget you, the fool who believed himself capable of possessing my power,” the Unbroken speaks. “I will make them remember as a cautionary tale. You may have convinced the people, but once they see me, and the true power I hold, they will discard you. You will become nothing. All this you built? It’s fucking mine.”\n\n“There would be no return without me. You owe me everything! I’ll have you slowly bled out, like a slaughtered animal, and take your power for myself,” the Emperor shouts back.\n\n“Enough! I tire of this game,” the Unbroken screams.\n\nThe Unbroken summons a sword from your palm and drives it into the neck of the wyvern. In a distressed cry, the beast descends in a dive straight for the edge of the bluffs. Gathering speed, your eyes water at the rush of air. Your hand grabs one of the wyvern’s horns in order to keep your body from flying from the wyvern’s back. The ground is fast approaching. There’s no way either you or the Emperor can survive the impact.\n\nIn a crash of dust and rock, the wyvern hits the bluff, its momentum leaving behind a long line of crater as if a dry canal. Unable to stop or grab a foothold, the beast slips over the cliff and disappears to crashing waves below, the Emperor along with it. You watch the scene unfold, still in the air. Shadowy, dark purple wisps emanate from your shoulder blades in the loose form of wings. Unlike the wyvern, the wings don’t flap, they merely float, swaying up and down, weightless, like a cloud.\n\nThe Unbroken wills your flight path downward, and you feel your feet touch the ground.\n\n“Speak, vessel. You are not without value,” it commands.\n\nThe power enables you to speak, you, not the merely the voice within. “Here I thought to use your power for myself, a tool to be used and discarded. In reality, it was the other way around. Were you always destined to be reborn through me?”\n\n“My return was inevitable. It is a great honor to be the vessel in which my return manifests. In time you will learn the truth of that statement.”\n",
  "page 166": "You take your original position in the council and notice Seth giving you a look. He doesn’t hold it for long, though, apparently just wanting you to know he’s aware of your absence. You give him a slight shrug in acknowledgement.\n\n“So, Seth, can the raid be successful?” King Aeric asks through an ale-filled beard.\n\nSeth pulls a stray hair from his armored robe. “Of course, my king. The Emperor’s troops have gotten lazy in the past few years. I’m sure they’re just waiting us out until the Empire can free up more troops for a grand-scale siege. Right now, they’re content keeping us walled in. I’d be surprised if they’re even running drills down there.”\n\nAnother man, wearing the same colors as Seth chimes in. “Still, we must not act too hastily. If surprise is our best ally, we’d be foolish to squander it at an inopportune time.”\n\nKing Aeric addresses the new speaker. “Mordecai, you’ve remained quiet until now. Tell me what you think.”\n\nThe man, Mordecai, looks around the room. His long hair tied behind his head melts into the top of the robe. You can tell he hasn’t shaved in quite some time, despite the lack of full beard. Even though he wears the same robe as Seth, the attire of King Aeric’s inner circle, his personal upkeep is well the opposite of the clean-cut Seth.\n\n“I say patience, my king,” Mordecai says. “Let the Empire waste resources and manpower sitting at the bottom of our mountain. Eventually there will be a time to strike, but I’m not so certain it’s now. We can last here for many years.”\n\nSeth shakes his head in disagreement but doesn’t speak out.\n\n“I will make a decision in the morning. Dismissed,” King Aeric says, picking up the jug of ale.\n\nThe council members bow to the king and crowd towards the door. Seth makes straight for you, pushing aside an elderly advisor.\n\n“You, boy, follow me,” he says and exits the room, not waiting for your reply. The elderly advisor that was gently guided off course raises an eyebrow at you as if to say you better get going. You chase after Seth.\n",
  "page 169": "The backdoor out of the castle isn’t really a door. It’s more like a window. In fact, it is a window, scarcely used since it’s missing glass and is large enough that falling outside wouldn’t take much. A wrong step into the three-inch-from-the-ground window sill, and you’re plummeting down the rocky slope.\n\nYou poke your head out to view the landscape. While the climb is steep, the rocks are jagged, leaving a fair amount of hand-holds for climbers. The seeming break in security would have you worried if not for the disarming of several traps along the way. Any intruder would be meet with death -- though not so swift, depending on the trap they sprung. You tie your longsword to your pack to prevent it from falling out and begin the climb.\n\n“Don’t look down, don’t look down,” you quietly repeat to yourself. The wind carries most of the words away from you. You find the climb isn\u0027t too difficult, though you\u0027re careful to preserve your energy. The last place you want to lose muscle strength is on a cliffside. The irony pops into your mind as you continue to climb; for whatever reason, fate seems to have you climb towards Seth. You definitely prefer the rope.\n\nA few meters down, you see a piece of cloth hanging on a sharp rock. The dark red piece must have come from Seth\u0027s robe. You were going the right way, though to be fair, down feels as good a direction as any. Several minutes later, you come across a series of broken-off rocks. You slow your descent as you imagine the surrounding area might have loose hand-holds as well. Just as your arms start to exhaust, you eye a ledge of sorts. The jutting rock couldn\u0027t be more than five inches long, but it works well enough for you to stand on, leaning your back against the rock wall behind you. You rub your arms to get the blood flowing and roll your wrists a few times.\n\nIt\u0027s here that you finally look down. You\u0027re not too far up now, probably a few hundred feet, still not a height you\u0027d survive falling from. The mountainside transitions into a thick forest. The tree-littered hills roll off in the distance, with only a few mountains poking up overhead. If you weren\u0027t inches away from death, you\u0027d enjoy the view. Satisfied at your arm strength, you continue the journey down.\n\nWhen your feet finally hit the ground, you breathe a sigh of relief. You take a brief glance at the rocky pathway. The castle is a tiny dot in the distance, barely visible through the sunlight. A crumpled body lies not 20 feet from where you\u0027re standing. A victim of the climb down, his body looks freshly dead, though it\u0027s harder to tell with several bones sticking out from the skin. The man\u0027s face is unrecognizable. You search his body for anything useful and come up empty. Whatever things he was carrying is long gone. A few broken branches alert you of activity in the area. Upon closer inspection, the grass is smashed in the same area. It had to be the raiding party. You take off in the forest towards the tracks.\n",
  "page 202": "Daylight. The rising sun peers over surrounding hills, sending its golden rays long on the green hilltops. You sit, cross-legged, waiting for the light to appear. Eventually, it rises high enough for the rays to land on your face, sending its warmth throughout your body. Off in the distance, a crow squawks, disturbed by another animal.\n\nYour sword is laid out in front of you. You eye the familiar sheathe, the protector of your most treasured possession. As if still at the monastery, a voice rings in your head. Not the Unbroken voice, the one tainted by darkness, but the voice of the monks.\n\nForm one! You move into action, performing the technique as best as one can do. Still, you identify areas to improve. Each time you flow through the forms, you see certain ways to progress. The work is never finished.\n\nForm two! Strength pours from your limbs. Your muscles are strong, built up from practicing each morning. It doesn’t feel stale; it never bores you. The practice flows through you as you flow through the practice. You become one with the forms. They push your body to greater levels, and you gladly welcome the challenge.\n\nForm three! Your breath becomes heavy, labored by the intensity of the practice. Still, you press on, not allowing your physical limitations to hold you back. It’s even more of a motivator, not letting your physical form affect the forms. Your jaw clenches as you deepen your breathing to continue on. Each movement is paired with a breath. You time it perfectly, allowing the fresh morning air to fuel your muscles.\n\nYou spin, using the momentum of your body to power your heel kick, finishing the movement with a jumping overhead swing. Sweat drips from your forehead, creating a small mud puddle at your feet. Taking a sip from your waterskin, you take another deep breath of morning air. It’s cloudy, but you can tell the sun will soon burn through, transitioning the sky into a bright blue. You’ve not yet reached your destination, but damn if you won’t enjoy the journey along the way.\n",
  "page 168": "As much as you look up to Seth, King Aeric holds ultimate authority. You decide to wait for the King’s command instead of joining the rogue raiding party. Besides, King Aeric was going to decide in the morning. You hope Seth holds out for a least one more night, but you’re doubtful. Once his mind is made up, there’s not a thing anyone can do. Alone in the training grounds, you begin to flow through your forms. You lose yourself in the practice until nightfall.\n\nYou rise early, as you do most days. The castle is ablaze with news of Seth’s rogue party. They still haven’t returned, despite the sun starting to rise. Late raiding parties are never a good sign. A typical raid needs to hit hard and hit fast; a prolonged skirmish hardly ever works out for a raiding party. While you’re sitting cross-legged cooling down from your practice, a group of soldiers march into the training grounds. They part, allowing Mordecai to walk through.\n\n“Did you know about this?” he questions.\n\nYou peer one eye open. “Yes.”\n\n“Take him,” Mordecai directs. You uncross your legs and stand, preparing for the two approaching guards. You swat away their attempt to shackle your wrists, and instead clasp the iron yourself.\n\nMordecai escorts you to the throne room, where King Aeric sits, looking quite unamused. His look towards you is sobering, the same could be said for his bodily condition, something you aren’t used to seeing. His fist slams down on the throne’s arm rest.\n\n“Damn it, refugee, why didn’t you stop them?” he spits.\n\n“My king, I have a realistic understanding of my skillset. I could hardly stop Seth on a bad day, let alone an entire group of men.”\n\n“You know what I mean, monk. They could have been stopped if you said something,” King Aeric says.\n\n“Seth and his men have chosen their path. It is not my place to decide their fate,” you say.\n\n“No…but it is my place to decide yours,” King Aeric answers. “You are hereby banished from this castle until you return with Seth or proof of their defeat. You have served me well in your short time here, and that’s the only reason you aren’t meeting the axe. At least this way, you have a fighting chance and will possibly do something useful. Now go!”\n\nAeric’s men allow you to pack your gear, along with several days of rations, a huge kindness in your opinion, before leading you to the southern end of the castle. The narrow bridge to the front gates lies on the north side. The south is sheer mountainside.\n\n“What’d you expect? We can’t just open the front gates under siege,” one of the guards aptly points out.\n\nYou remove a portion of your rations from your backpack. “Here. Dinner’s on me. I’d rather pack light than risk the fall,” you say.\n\nThe man grabs the food with a smile. “I’ll put it to good use.” Losing the grin, he adds, “In all seriousness, I hope you return. You’re a good kid and an even better fighter. Hate to lose you this way.”\n\n“You and me both,” you say, shaking his hand.\n",
  "page 201": "No. You’ve spent your entire life building up a defense against the voice. The mental barriers you’ve built must remain strong. For the most part, you’ve kept it under control and surrendering now would make that all for nothing. It would be the easy way out. Instead of relying on your own resolve, on your practice, it would be cowardly to surrender now. You shake your head as a visible commitment to your decision. There’s no going back now. You must press on.\n\nA wall of white and gold awaits you. You tear through their ranks like a sieging ram. Your sword cuts through Imperial soldiers, finding vulnerable spots in their armor. Each swing of your blade either sets up or finds the killing blow. Using the power Lorthander honed, you back up the deadly display of swordsmanship with dark magic, illuminating your sword in a shadowy purple flame. The magic eats through the Imperials’ armor like flame into dry parchment.\n\nRoaring, you look up to see the Emperor himself riding atop a wyvern. The beast flaps its wings in the air, bearing its fangs in your direction. A golden mask stares at you, as if contemplating the outcome. The Emperor, wearing a mask of gold, commands the wyvern forward, flying over both armies, abandoning his. The wyvern becomes a small dot in the distance, and the defending force, crippled by the sight of their leader fleeing, lay down their arms in surrender.\n\n“Take them prisoner. Enough blood has been spilled this day,” you order.\n\n“Are you sure that’s wise? In our position, they would put us to the axe,” a nearby soldier comments.\n\nYour gaze falls on the man speaking out. He nervously looks around, hoping someone nearby will support his decision.\n\nCalmly, you address him. “That’s what separates us from them. There’s no honor in execution, in defeating an unarmed prisoner. The day is won. We mustn’t stain the glory of our victory with massacre.”\n\n...\n\nTheir cheers keep you up. Late into the night, inebriated shouts following unintelligent laughter fill the air. You sit, kneeling, in a room deep in the servant corridor in attempt to find peace and quiet. You don’t. The city is alive; fires burn in the streets, illuminating the destructive behavior of the men, your men. Even here, in the corner of the keep, the night breeze carries their drunken cries, partially mixed with smoke from the fires.\n\nA knock at the door appears, distracting you momentarily from the army’s celebration. Standing outside is Seth holding two tankards. He offers you one, which you take with gratitude.\n\n“We did it. The Empire is no more. Tomorrow we’ll abolish the unified government and allow each territory to rule themselves. It’s taken decades, but we finally made it,” he says.\n\n“History has changed for the better,” you answer. “Any word of the Emperor? Well, I should say, the former Emperor.”\n\n“There’s been sightings of a wyvern heading towards the Ellehorn Forest. It’s as good of a place for someone who doesn’t want to be found,” Seth replies.\n\n“Can’t say I don’t blame him,” you say, taking a small sip from the tankard. The ale tingles on your tongue, bursting with a sweet, frothy flavor.\n\n“You don’t mean that. Sure, they’re overindulging a little bit, but this is the greatest day of their lives. Let them celebrate, and not to worry, their penance will be a splitting headache in the morning.”\n\n“I couldn’t have done it without you, Seth. Your guidance kept me on the path, even when victory felt far away. I have no illusion that your part is equally, if not more, instrumental in the Empire’s defeat.”\n\n“You’ll get no argument from me there,” Seth says with a smile.\n\nSuddenly, you know what you must do. You place the tankard on a nearby table and strap your sword on. Your possession are few, and you pack them in a traveling pack. The small lantern illuminating the room is extinguished, leaving you in the night’s darkness. Seth’s figure stands at the doorway, still. His crimson robe looks ceremonial in the backlight of the hallway’s torches.\n\n“My part is over here. Politics don’t interest me. I didn’t come all this way to rule over my fellow man. I saw evil and had to act. The Empire is no more, and perhaps we can live in a peaceful time. I’ve witnessed the good of man, along with the darkness that can inhabit one’s heart. Ellehorn forest you say? Nature has always been a welcomed ally, which is more than I can say for the city here.”\n\nSeth’s eyes meet yours. “This is it then.”\n\n“It is.”\n\n“Let the bards sing of the last mountain monk, survivor of the monastery massacre, and conqueror of the Empire.”\n\nYou place your hand on Seth’s shoulder. “Let them sing what they will. A man’s actions are his own, not to be influenced or swayed by others.”\n",
  "page 204": "The Unbroken returns you back to the capital city. You arrive to find your army is full control of the city. The keep, without leadership of the Emperor, fell to your invading force. Countless fires burn throughout the city as your men have taken the initiative to burn every Imperial banner and coat of arms in sight. The Unbroken walks through the courtyard of the keep, stepping over the bodies of fallen Imperial soldiers. Your men stop what they’re doing, and salute you as you walk past. You find your commanders gathered underneath the high arches of the main hall.\n\nA man in an armored dark crimson robe turns his head, noticing you. “You’re back. And the Emperor?” Seth asks.\n\n“Taken care of,” the lifeless voice speaks.\n\n“That’s my boy. We’re in the process of abolishing the Empire, giving freedom back to each territory. With the Emperor’s death, the remaining army should fall apart. We might have a few warlords, Imperial commanders trying to assume leadership, but they will be dealt with.”\n\n“No,” the Unbroken speaks.\n\n“What?” Seth asks.\n\n“No. The Empire is mine.”\n\nSeth’s eyes narrow, gauging yours. “So it’s true then. You’ve returned. I wasn’t sure I’d be able to do it, but seeing you now, I know I must...for the sake of the man I once knew.”\n\nA flurry of crimson and blade flies through the air toward you. Translucent weapons appear in your hands, just in time, blocking the sudden assault. The other commanders in the great hall draw their swords, but don’t attack yet, unsure which of their two leaders to aide.\n\n“I should have done this years ago. I’ve seen small appearances of you rearing your ugly head, but I always thought he was strong enough to resist. The fault lies with me for not ending his life, and the line of the Unbroken, sooner,” Seth says in another assault.\n\n“Your treason will be dealt with. You’ll be made an example of, and your death will dissuade any further enemies of the state,” The Unbroken speaks, blocking Seth’s attack with ease. “I will pull each nail from your body, then work my way up your limbs, peeling your skin from your bones and putting flame to the exposed flesh underneath. Your teeth will be pulled, one at a time, slowly, deliberately, each one placed in front of you like spoils of war. Next, your tongue will be severed and mouth sewn shut, so your false words don’t spill into listening ears.”\n\nThe other commanders overhearing the words from your mouth visibly object. They know you and Seth well enough to know the actions and words from your mouth aren’t your own. As one, weapons are pulled from their resting positions. Seth stands before you, the commanders of your army behind him. The man in the crimson robe, the man who you’ve followed your entire life, raises his sword to end your life.\n\nThey slowly surround you, creating a deadly circle with you at the center. You see the faces of men you’ve fought beside, bled with, buried your comrades with. They don’t recognize the man before them, the vessel filled and embodied by evil. Their leader is gone, and his replacement is the very darkness mothers scare their children with. You cannot scream, you cannot move, you cannot react. The Unbroken is in control. He strikes them down with pleasure at your lips. He doesn’t finish them fast, each man is given several cuts before finishing the final blow.\n\nSlowly, one by one, each man drops, a victim to the dark power. All that remains is Seth, standing among the fallen bodies of his allies. His eyes briefly dart to their bodies, taking in their death as motivation to continue. Seth’s twin blades arc low, then high in a sweeping motion, always working, intertwined, to find an opening in your defense. The Unbroken parries and deflects the blades away, even allowing one high strike to narrowly miss just above your head. You understand it’s turned into a game, one that the Unbroken will finish as soon as he’s done toying with your mentor. Seth lunges forward.\n\nThe translucent weapons tear through the back of Seth’s heels, sending him sprawling to the floor. Seth\u0027s pair of blades fly from grasp, sliding just out of reach from his outstretched hands. He turns to your approaching footsteps. He starts to say something, but slow piercing from the translucent sword point turns his words into a soft gurgle. Immediately, the Unbroken covers the wound with dark magic.\n\n“Don’t think you’re getting off that easy,” the voice lifelessly speaks.\n\nThey are waiting for you, my Emperor.\n\nLorthander stands in the opening to the great hall, leaning against his gnarled staff. The Unbroken wills your body to meet him.\n\nLong have I awaited this day.\n\nIn the keep’s courtyard, rows of soldiers are lined up in perfect unison. At your presence, they drop to their knee as one. Dead men from the siege line the courtyard walls, creating a second inner wall built from mangled bodies and fallen soldiers. It’s then that you notice the soldiers in line are both from your army and the defending Imperial force. A subtle, raven-colored mark appears above their eyebrow, the mark of the Unbroken.\n\nThey are devoutly loyal. The mark compels them.\n\n“Rise,” the Unbroken commands. “We have much work to do.”\n",
  "page 33": "Two horses trot side-by-side along the weathered road, their riders completely cloaked. As the riders draw near to the village, the townsfolk gather their kids inside and shut their doors. Estabrook didn’t receive many travelers and with the war going on, strangers usually meant trouble. The riders stop at the village’s only inn. The building sporting a wooden sign with a carved tankard and bed was usually the first place people stopped. The brothel next to it was a close second.\n\nYou tie your horse to a post and look to Kassi. “Not the friendliest looking place, eh?” you comment.\n\n“Nowadays I consider any time we’re not greeted at swordpoint as friendly,” she replies.\n\nAs she dismounts, the light rain collected on her cloak scatters in a puff of droplets. Her bright blonde hair is now dyed a dark autumn red. It’s tied into several loops all ending in a single tie in back. If she were to untie it, you know it would reach near to her waist. Your own has grown out considerably longer than the cropped monastery cut.\n\nYou eye the white and gold sigil posted outside the inn: a wreath crown at the hilt of an upside down sword. Every town, village, and city you’ve encountered in the past few years has flown the empire’s colors. Places that openly rebelled against the empire were burned. Surrounding areas learned quickly to post the sigil...and their allegiance. The land may have been conquered, but King Aeric’s keep remains standing. Even the Empire’s seemingly endless resources have fallen short in capturing the capital, though it’s been laid siege for many years. No one knows how King Aeric could have survived being holed up for that long.\n\nA group of armor clad soldiers march by. Their footsteps stomp on the muddy path at exactly the same moment splashing drops of mud into their well-polished greaves.\n\n“Seems the Empire’s influence has grown in Estabrook,” you say after they pass.\n\n“Kind of hard to resist when your king is holed up in his castle,” Kassi answers.\n\nYou finish tying up the horses and enter the inn. Long bench-like tables fill the interior. You see the kitchen almost directly behind the bar. A few downtrodden patrons sit milking their cups, scattered at the tables. No one appears to be conversing with one another. The bar looks empty, save for a traveling merchant. You catch a glimpse of graying hair as the waitress rushes past carrying an armload of dishes.\n\nYou find two empty barstools and sit. The wooden seat is only slightly less comfortable than your saddle. The warmth of the inn makes up for it, though. Your eyes focus on the bottles in front of you. Brother Samuel had let you try a sip of his mead once. Besides that, the drink hasn’t touched your lips. Part of you is curious, and the other wants to keep your senses sharp.\n\n“You’re not thinking about ordering that junk, are you?” Kassi asks noticing your gaze.\n\n“I admit it’s crossed my mind. More than a few times, actually, but I need my wits,” you answer.\n\nThe merchant, overhearing your conversation, butts in.\n\n“Good. More for me then. Say, you two look a little young to be traveling alone. Where’re your parents?”\n\nYou eye the merchant. A subtle sway in his head alerts you to his drink level. The slurring of “your” confirms it.\n\n“Respectfully, our parents’ location doesn’t concern you,” Kassi answers.\n\n“Don’t give me lip, girl,” the Merchant’s voice rises. “I’ll not be spoken down to by a kid.”\n\n“That’s enough, friend,” you step in. You place a coin on the bar top. “Have your next on me.”\n\nThe act seems to calm the man, and he returns to his drinking.\n\n“I can handle myself,” Kassi says to you. This time quieter, so the Merchant won’t hear.\n\n“Kass, I’m more than aware of that fact,” you answer. “I’d just prefer to not gather any more attention than we already have. By the villagers reaction to our arrival, we’re probably the talk of the town. It’s only a matter of time before the local authorities come knocking.”\n\n“Which wouldn’t be a bad thing for our contact to see. I imagine that conversation to be less than pleasant. Speaking of our contact, where is he?” Kassi adds.\n\n“Not sure. The message said he’ll approach us.”\n\n“Probably watching us to see if we’re empire spies or not.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you?”\n\nShe shrugs. “Depends. The average person probably assumes they’re being watched and likely is on their best behavior. If you really want to know their loyalty, you’re better off backing them into a corner and forcing them to decide.”\n\n“Speaking of which…” you begin to say as the inn door flies wide open. Two soldiers enter followed by a tall, thin old man. The man’s robes are fine quality. He moves with a certain air of authority, and you guess he’s not someone who likes repeating himself. The trio marches up to the bar.\n\n“So this is the man selling empire secrets,” he comments disapprovingly. “Take him.”\n\nThe two soldiers grab the drunk merchant and pull him from his seat. The Merchant attempts to say something, but a fist from one of the soldiers quiets him. He gazes towards you pleadingly.\n\n“Oh no, I don’t like that look on you,” Kassi whispers. “Last time I saw that look, we were given chamber pot duty for a month.”\n\n“Follow my lead,” you say with a wink. You turn towards the soldiers and put on your best performance.\n\n“Please don’t take my father,” you beg. “He’s an honest man, he’s just trying to take care of our sick mother.”\n\nKassi does her best to support you, although she’s a little stiff in your opinion. “Yes, uh, that’s right. We’ll starve without him.”\n\nThe soldiers loosen their grip a bit and turn to the old man for direction. “Magistrate?” one of them asks.\n\nThe Magistrate squints his eyes towards you. “You’re too well-dressed to be related to this swindler. He’d sooner steal your cloak than feed you or your ‘sick mother.’ Take them as well. I do not know what game you’re playing, but it’s against the law to interfere with official government business.”\n\n“Nice try, kids,” the Merchant manages to say before receiving another punch.\n\n“Guess we better try the backup plan,” Kassi says.\n\n“Which is?” you start to reply.\n\nBefore you finish speaking, Kassi grabs a nearby plate and smashes it into the Magistrate’s face. Shards of glass shatter into the air as the old man crumbles back. The soldiers look surprised at the sudden violence and toss the Merchant aside to focus on you and Kassi. Your right fist nails one of the soldiers on the chin. As his body falls to the floor, your knee meets his face mid-air.\n\nKassi fires a series of punches and kicks into the other soldier. He tries to keep up, but slowly begins to fade as the flurry continues. Taking mercy on him, you knock him out with a hook to the jaw. Kassi looks at you, a bit surprised, and then draws her dagger.\n\n“Wait, Kass, I don’t think--” you begin to say before she cuts downward with the razor sharp blade. Just before the blade pierces the soldier, it’s suddenly stopped. The Merchant stands between the two with his dagger drawn. The two stand unmoving, without speaking for a few seconds as you take in what’s happening.\n\n“You’re the contact,” you state.\n\n“That’s correct!” the “Merchant” answers with a grin. “And you’ve passed the test. Man, I thought for sure you were just going to stand there and do nothing.”\n\n“We aren’t alone here you know,” you say looking towards the waitress and the silent patrons in the room.\n\n“This entire inn is devoted to the cause, friend. They’re all in on it. Now I’d prefer it if your pretty sidekick here would put away her blade.”\n\nKassi scoffs at his remark. “Pfft, sidekick? You really have no idea what you’re talking about.”\n\nFeeling the need to calm things before they get out of hand you quickly jump in. “Let’s get on with the meeting. I believe you have some valuable information to share with us.”\n\nThe “Merchant” nods. “That’s correct. We’ve a cellar in this place. Many a good scheming is done in cellar. Oh, and call me Vishal.”\n",
  "page 32": "I’m not sure I would have survived the war if not for Kassi. Fate is a strange idea. Was I merely lucky she happened to be walking past Brother Trevor and I, or were we destined to cross paths? The monks believe in a divine being. They believe this divine being has a life laid out for them. The older I get, the less I believe in a predestined path. Men forge their destinies. Life-altering circumstances are everywhere if you know where to look.\n\nI mourn for the loss of the monastery. True, I was not the model acolyte or star pupil, but the monks gave me a home. They taught me the skillset I needed to survive violence...and in this world, violence is common. Brother Samuel was a father to me. I hope he knew that in the end.\n\nMy early adult years were full of adventure. Each new day brought excitement, a new opportunity to experience something new. Kassi and I were two young adults with an entire world before us to explore. We were not meant for monotony. We sought to give life meaning...and get revenge on our fallen brothers. We hunted for the men who massacred the monastery. Little did I know, I was the one being hunted...\n",
  "page 34": "You follow Vishal through the kitchen into the back pantry. He opens a large cupboard and reveals the hidden back to a staircase below. The cellar is lined with barrels and debris. In the center, sits a single table with a map spread over the surface. Vishal kicks around in the debris and finally pulls two lanterns from the junk. He lights and sets both on the table.\n\n“So,” he says. “You want to join the resistance.”\n\n“We want to fight the Empire, yes,” you answer. “An enemy of the Emperor is an ally in my book.\n\n“Ahh, so you have a personal vendetta then. That’s the only reason you’d be here. What tragedy occurred in your short lifetime to project you into a life of violence? Dead parents perhaps?”\n\n“My reason is of no concern to you.”\n\n“That’s where you’re wrong, my young renegade. I always know who I go into battle with.”\n\n“Have you even been in battle?” Kassi interrupts.\n\n“Have you?” Vishal retorts.\n\n\n“You’re looking at the only surviving members of the monastery massacre,” Kassi answers. “We’ve have plenty of experience in battle.”\n\n“The mountain monks…” Vishal begins to say, awestruck. “I didn’t know any survived.”\n\n“We’ve proven ourselves, spy. Now it’s your turn.”\n\n“Very well,” Vishal sighs. “I specialize in knowledge. I know things and have friends in the most unattainable positions in the nation. I admit I’m a bit surprised, not even I knew about your survival. My friends and I strive towards the same goal.”\n\n“Which is…?”\n\n“Freedom.”\n\n“You might find that a near impossible goal. The Empire’s might is vast, and their power is spreading,” you answer.\n\n“Exactly. I’m counting on the Emperor’s conquest to be his biggest weakness.”\n\nVishal eyes your confused look and continues.\n\n“The Empire is unsustainable in the long run. They have to import goods from the farthest nations in order to keep it supplied. It’s gathering territory, too quickly, and does not have the resources to manage its upkeep. Eventually, it will implode on itself. I’m here to speed the process along. A shipment goes missing here, a food supply rots, an inventory tally gets miscounted. I’m in the business of sabotage, my friend. Why has no one been able to resist the Emperor? They tackle the Empire’s strength head on. It’s like running straight into a charging bull. I’d rather stand on the edge of a cliff and watch the bull run itself over the edge.”\n\n“We’re warriors, not skilled in the art of deception. How can we help?” Kassi inputs.\n\n“Muscle is always needed. Even the most cunning of plans sometimes go south.\n",

You do realize we know nothing about you,” you say.\n\n“Fair enough,” he answers lighting up with a smile. “Ask away then.”\n\n“What do you have against the Empire?”\n\n“You mean besides their merciless killing all over the continent? I’ve witnessed personally the horrors of their conquered tribes. You do realize the Emperor\u0027s actual army, the ones in white and gold, are only a small portion of the soldiers at his command. They’re his elite force and only deployed in special circumstances. The rest of the time, the Emperor sends the armies from his conquered territories to do his dirty work.”\n\n“We’ve seen such tribes. They seem more beast than man,” you say.\n\n“Exactly. They’re undisciplined, violent men who get to run lawless because they bring more captured land to the Empire. The Emperor allows, even encourages, evil men to roam free and he’s just as bad as them in my opinion. Perhaps a bit worse because he has the power to stop them.”\n\n“Makes sense. Were you in covert operations before the war?”\n\n“In a way...my guise as a merchant is simply wearing the costume of my previous life. Before the war, I had an extensive trade network. A little favor here, a little favor there sort of thing to important people. I always know who I get into business with.”\n\nKassi rolls her eyes sensing Vishal’s theme.\n\nVishal continues. “Most people wanted to help after seeing the evil actions of the Empire. Others needed to be convinced. In the end, it’s an impressive organization if I should say so myself, and we’ve been a thorn in the Empire’s side for many years now. Anything else?”\n\nYou shake your head. “Good enough for me. Let’s get on with it.”\n",

I always know who I go into battle with.”\n\n“Have you even been in battle?” Kassi interrupts.\n\n“Have you?” Vishal retorts.\n\n\n“You’re looking at the only surviving members of the monastery massacre,” Kassi answers. “We’ve have plenty of experience in battle.”\n\n“The mountain monks…” Vishal begins to say, awestruck. “I didn’t know any survived.”\n\n“We’ve proven ourselves, spy. Now it’s your turn.”\n\n“Very well,” Vishal sighs. “I specialize in knowledge. I know things and have friends in the most unattainable positions in the nation. I admit I’m a bit surprised, not even I knew about your survival. My friends and I strive towards the same goal.”\n\n“Which is…?”\n\n“Freedom.”\n\n“You might find that a near impossible goal. The Empire’s might is vast, and their power is spreading,” you answer.\n\n“Exactly. I’m counting on the Emperor’s conquest to be his biggest weakness.”\n\nVishal eyes your confused look and continues.\n\n“The Empire is unsustainable in the long run. They have to import goods from the farthest nations in order to keep it supplied. It’s gathering territory, too quickly, and does not have the resources to manage its upkeep. Eventually, it will implode on itself. I’m here to speed the process along. A shipment goes missing here, a food supply rots, an inventory tally gets miscounted. I’m in the business of sabotage, my friend. Why has no one been able to resist the Emperor? They tackle the Empire’s strength head on. It’s like running straight into a charging bull. I’d rather stand on the edge of a cliff and watch the bull run itself over the edge.”\n\n“We’re warriors, not skilled in the art of deception. How can we help?” Kassi inputs.\n\n“Muscle is always needed. Even the most cunning of plans sometimes go south.\n",
  "page 39": "“Get some rest. Tomorrow we travel to the Narrow’s Edge Outpost,” Vishal says. “I have a room prepared for you upstairs.”\n\nOne of the “soldiers” stays behind talking with Vishal while the other, Yuri, leads you upstairs. He gives a nod to the waitress as you pass back through the main room. The small in only boasts five rooms upstairs for travelers.\n\n“I’m sorry, but we only have one open room. I suppose you’re used to sharing a room though,” Yuri says finishing with a nervous half cough, half laugh.\n\n“We’re grateful just to have a roof over our heads,” you answer shaking Yuri’s hand.\n\nThe door opens with a nasty squeal, and the room itself mirrors the small size of the inn. A single bed in the center takes up almost half of the floor space. To the right wall, a tiny desk is wedged in the corner. You walk in and place your traveling gear on the floor. Kassi lights the lantern on the desk.\n\n“Rather tight quarters, huh?” Kassi comments.\n\n“More space and privacy than in the monastery barracks,” you answer.\n\nThe mention of your childhood home turns both of your moods somber. Outside, you hear a stray dog barking.\n\n“It’s been almost 15 years since we were there,” Kassi comments. “And the Empire’s strength has only grown since.”\n\n“We’ve had our fair share of victories. Enough to get noticed by one of the leading organizations resisting the Empire. Soon the ‘thorn in the Empire’s side’ will cripple it to its knees.”\n\n“Practice your forms with me?” she suddenly asks.\n\n“Sure, Kass.”\n\nYou flow into a meditative state allowing your martial abilities to empty your thoughts. You aren’t nervous about the mission. You have no personal feelings towards Kassi. You only know the practice. The cramped room doesn’t allow you to move much, but that allows you to adjust the technique to fit the environment. Time has no meaning in your state. You finish by sitting cross-legged in front of the bed in reflection.\n\nYou open your eyes to find the room completely dark. You hear soft breathing coming from the bed. Kassi. You feel on the ground for bedding and find nothing. Either Kassi didn’t think to leave some for you or she fell asleep before throwing down a blanket and pillow.\n",

  "page 31": "“I’m not going either,” you say.\n\n“Gods, you’re going to get yourselves killed. Not my problem anymore.”\n\nWith that, Seth disappears down the short staircase. You feel Kassi’s arms wrap around you.\n\n“I thought you were going to go for sure,” she says.\n\n“And leave you? No way,” you answer. “Come on, we better rejoin with the others.”\n\nYou and Kassi exit the meditation room and navigate back through the hallways. You hear battle sounds almost immediately. The fight is working its way deeper into the monastery. You run into a few eager soldiers along the way. You can only guess they tore away from the main force to claim treasure first. They don’t get the chance. You and Kassi don’t leave any breathing.\n\nSuddenly, the monastery’s tower bell begins to ring, leaving a sinking feeling in your chest. In these circumstances it can only mean one thing: surrender. Voices bring you back to reality. The clash of steel fills your ears no more. The battle has subsided. The voices appear to come from outside. You gaze out a window overlooking the courtyard to see what’s happening.\n\nMonks stand in the center of a circle, surrounded by the invading soldiers. The Grandmaster is near the edge, fiercely arguing with one of the invading soldiers. You assume it to be their leader by the way he’s dressed. Instead of the ragged armor, he’s in full chain mail and the spear in his hand is far more intricate of a weapon than you’ve run into. Instead of the generic sword, it’s dyed completely black. In fact, it’s the only weapon of the soldiers you’ve run into that looks as if thought was poured into creating it. The argument between the soldier and the Grandmaster continues until a war horn pauses it.\n\nThe horde of soldiers seem to understand the war horn’s signal because they move back to the courtyard’s walls to create more space. Through high arched entryway, you see a platoon of soldiers enter wearing white and gold. Unlike the invading force, these ones are well-equipped. They march in unison. The large tower shields they bear create an impenetrable wall. If you had to guess, you’d bet their combat strategy keeps the same synergy as their march. The white and gold soldiers part in the center, and one of their own walks to the front meeting the Grandmaster face to face.\n\nUnlike the others, this one doesn’t have a shield. A sizable greatsword hangs on his back and a full helm with two horns sits on his head. He addresses the Grandmaster, and luckily you’re just in range to make out his words.\n\n“It is finished. Swear your fealty to the Emperor and you will be granted life.”\n\nYou catch a twinge of pride in his voice.\n\n“We serve no one but the divine,” the Grandmaster answers.\n\nThe soldier with the greatsword crosses his arms. “Keep whatever archaic beliefs you may have. The Emperor only demands your service in this lifetime.”\n\n“I am afraid we cannot oblige. Our worldly alignment is already devoted to King Aeric. We simply cannot turn our back on promises made, despite the circumstances,” the Grandmaster answers.\n\n“Such a shame. Apparently the rumors of the deady mountain monks are simply not true.”\n\nWith his reply, the soldier pulls the greatsword from his back and swings through the air in a single motion. The jagged blade cuts through the air and then stops. The Grandmaster’s open hand catches the blade mid-air. A layer of magic emanates from his palm, protecting his skin from the deadly sword.\n\n“Not even your mysticism can protect you from the Empire’s might, monk,” the soldiers speaks.\n\nThe greatsword begins to emit sparks as if from a blacksmith’s hammer. The Grandmaster’s eyes start to grow wide as he experiences the power of the weapon. The blade slices through the Grandmaster’s open palm, removing the hand, and leaving a large gouge in his chest. The Grandmaster’s body his the ground with a solid thud, his severed hand closely following.\n\nThe group of herded monks look shaken at the sight of their leader’s fallen body. The Grandmaster, the spiritual and mystical leader of the monastery, lies bleeding on the ground. The piercing gray eyes that frightened acolytes are now lifeless. From within the herd, you see Brother Samuel step forward.\n\n“We will do what you say. Just don’t harm anyone else,” Brother Samuel says.\n\nThe soldier with the greatsword removes his helm and shakes out his shoulder-length hair. He’s much younger than you expected. He couldn’t be much more than thirty years old.\n\n“The Empire has no room for misguided ideologies,” he states to the army around him.\n\nOn his command the onslaught of soldiers commences. The sheer number surrounding the monks overpower the seasoned monks. Though an average monk may be able to slay tens of men, thousands surround them. You witness several spears piercing Brother Samuel’s gut. Before you can cry out at the death of your mentor, Kassi’s open palm covers your mouth.\n\n“I hate to say it, but we need to run,” she whispers.\n\nYou nod. “There’s nothing we can do,” you softly speak through tears.\n\nYou and Kassi leave the window\u0027s vantage point and sneak down the end of the hallway. One of the open windows leads to the rooftop. With most of the focus on the gathered monks, you’re able to silently walk on the rooftop opposite the direction of the courtyard. No sentries block your way as you climb down the outer edge of the monastery\u0027s walls. Your life at the monastery is over, and a war-torn country lies before you. The life you once knew would never be the same.\n",
  "page 30": "“I’ll go with you,” you say.\n\n“What!” Kassi yells. “Fine, go ahead and leave us. You were never really one of us anyway.”\n\n“You don’t mean that,” you answer.\n\n“Enough talk, kid,” Seth intervenes.\n\nYou attempt to give Kassi a hug, but she backs away. You notice her eyes beginning to tear up, but she turns and runs before they can fall. Sounds of the battle echo into the meditation room. The soldiers have almost made their way to your position.\n\n“Come on, let’s get out of here,” Seth breaks the silence.\n\nYou follow him down the short steps into the narrow tunnel. There isn’t any visible light, so Seth pulls a candle from beside the shrine and takes it with you. You march along in silence and near darkness. The occasional rat scurrying by is the only change in setting. After a few hours, the tunnel begins to incline slightly and you feel a subtle breeze. By now, the candle has long burned out. You follow behind Seth with your arms in front, grazing his back for direction. You keep your steady pace until he stops, suddenly, causing you to bump into his back.\n\n“Here we are,” he utters, more to himself than you. A single rope hangs down in front of you. Looking up, you see a glimpse of a round opening way above you. It must be at least twice as high as the monastery’s walls.\n\n“Are you sure this is safe?” you ask.\n\n“More safe than staying within the monastery walls,” he answers. “I’ll climb first. Once I get to the top, I’ll shake the rope. We better go one at a time just in case. Don’t worry, kid. If it holds my weight, it’ll hold yours too. Try to use your legs as much as possible to keep your grip from tiring. Alright, see you at the top.”\n\nYou’re left alone in the dark, save for the small light above you. Now that things have settled a bit, you finally have time to think about the events that just happened. How could an entire army show up almost out of thin air? Kassi said King Aeric was supposed to protect the monastery. Why didn’t his army show up? Then it hits you. Everyone you know is dead. Kassi, Brother Samuel, even Garth is gone. You are alone.\n\nThe rope begins to shake signaling your turn. You take a deep breath and begin to climb up. Your new life was about to begin.\n",
  "page 170": "The tracks in the forest are easy enough to follow. The raiding party didn\u0027t exactly spend time, well, covering their tracks. Plus, covering the footprints and broken branches of a group of men takes time. The party was designed for destruction, not clean-up.\n\nThe tracks lead in the general direction of sieging army, but then suddenly move east. You stoop down to examine a smudge in the lightly grassend forest floor. A bootprint; a man\u0027s boot, obviously, but the angle of the print is what alerts you. It looks like someone squashed a bug. More likely, the result of a pivot. The deepness of the print shows it was made with a fast moving foot or the boot-wearer was carrying several hundred pounds of weight. You assume it\u0027s the former. Then, you see it. Blood.\n",
  "page 172": "Blood. Lots of it. Too much for one man. The ground shows more imprints and what looks like a drag mark. Several arrow shafts lie broken on the ground, some firmly planted into tree trunks. Your senses sharp, something alerts you of another’s presence. A man stands, unmoving, behind you. You turn to face him, noticing the craftsmanship of his bow; it’s unlike any you’ve seen before. It’s not extravagant. It’s a simple design, really. The quality of the wood is what draws your attention. Smoothly bent and shaped, the bow is of the finest quality, befitting of a king’s weapon. The man’s youthful face is centered by a thick black moustache. Two gray eyes return your stare, seeking your intentions.\n\n“You’re not with the Empire,” he states, part questioningly.\n\n“I am not,” you confirm. “What happened here?”\n\n“Ambush. The king’s men were caught unawares.”\n\nStrange. They shouldn’t have known Seth and his raiding party were coming. You voice that to the man.\n\n“Well they did. It was a slaughter, save for one man.”\n\n“Which man? Where is he?” you ask.\n\n“The man with two blades. He’s recovering back in my home.”\n\n“Take me there.”\n\nThe man, Richard, leads you through the forest, taking many paths that are naturally hidden by the overgrowth. You can’t imagine the Empire could follow your tracks, Richard expertly hides any sort of disturbance you create along the way. The Empire would have to burn the entire forest to reach you, a disturbing thought considering that was a very real possibility.\n\n“What’s your role in all this?” you break the silence along the way.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“In the war. You’re no friend of the Empire, yet you don’t seem aligned with Aeric either.”\n\n“The ‘King’ and I have our disagreements, though I’d rather see him on the throne than an Imperial puppet. I was part of the King’s Rangers -- well, technically still am, but I’m on somewhat of an extended patrol in these parts.”\n\n“Do you encounter many Imperial troops?” you ask.\n\n“Not this far out. For the moment they seem content staying to the roads. I fear that won’t be the case once the castle falls. Ah, here we are.”\n\nRichard pulls what appears to be a thick fern from the ground and tosses it to the side. The space opens into a series of cascading boulders underground. Large round stones create a natural staircase leading down. Richard goes in first, directing you where to step. He explains some of the stones are decoys, and stepping on the wrong one would send you to your death below. As you descend into the sanctuary, you cover the entrance with the fern, blocking out any sort of natural light.\n",
  "page 171": "They were coming. Seth ducks from an arrow fired towards his head. How did they know we were coming? His twin blades dance in unison, taking apart the feeble defense of the young-faced boy in front of him. One blade lands in the boy\u0027s stomach and the other finishes the job at his neck.\n\nSeth is troubled, not by the gathering Empire soldiers in front of him, but how the hell did they know he was coming? The darkness of night should have protected them from being seen. They moved quietly, no one should have heard them. And yet, the Empire was ready, prepared for his assault. Nothing ever goes your way, huh? Better for the kid to have stayed. Better for him to live. Seth grits his teeth and engages the next soldier. How did they know we were coming?\n",
  "page 174": "From behind a hidden crevice, Richard reveals a torch and lights the tip. Flame bursts into the dark cave, sending shadows dancing on the walls. Upon reaching the bottom, a single tunnel lies directly ahead of you. The tunnel leads further into the cave, and eventually it opens into a spacious cavern. Several huts line the walls, constructed and stacked into the stone. Richard extinguishes the torch and places it on a metal ring near the edge of the cavern. The entire area is lit with several green flames. The magical light provides more than enough light to fill the space, and shines the village in its viridian glow.\n\n“This one’s mine,” Richard says, pointing towards the smallest of the huts.\n\n“Quite a nice village you have here,” you comment.\n\n“There’s not many of us -- a good thing, too, since this place would be unmanageable with a high number. This is the place for people who have no home, no king, no Emperor.”\n\n“Who leads them then?” you ask.\n\n“We lead ourselves,” Richard answers with a smile.\n\nRichard swings open the door to his hut. More green light pours from within. It’s a simple place, filled with solid wooden furniture. In the corner, a man lies in bed, a woman sponging his forehead. She turns at your arrival, surprised only for a brief moment at your presence. Her eyes glisten in the green light, sparkling against the bright blue as if gentle waves.\n\n“More company, Richard?” she sighs. “At least this one’s walking.”\n\n“You don’t mean that, Sarah. Our guest is banished from the territory until he learns information from this man. The King’s orders,” Richard says, placing an arm around Sarah to calm her.\n\n“I don’t mean to intrude,” you say with a slight bow. “This man, Seth, is important to me. He practically raised me since…” you trail off at the end, not wanting to divulge your history at the monastery.\n\n“We understand,” Sarah says. “I’m sorry for my reaction. Make yourself at home. I’ll bring you some tea.”\n\nYou approach the bedside to assess the Seth’s wounds. A large bloodstained bandage is bound across his chest. A similar one is wrapped around his bicep. His normally clean-shaven face has a light beard. Funny, you always assumed he shaved his face bare because he couldn’t grow a beard like the rest of King Aeric’s men. His two short swords hang, sheathed, on a chair nearby. Seth’s eyes are closed, and the rest of his face shows signs of dampness. Cold sweat. Not a good sign for a man recovering from battle wounds.\n\n“I see you made it, kid,” he speaks in not more than a whisper, eyes still closed.\n\n“I didn’t have much of a choice. I’m glad to see you’re still alive,” you respond.\n\n“Just catching up on some long-needed sleep. The castle quarters were getting a little tight for my care.”\n\n“Rest up then,” you say. “You can fill me in when you next wake.”\n",

  "page 176": "It could have gone better. Then again, it could have gone a lot worse. One thing’s for certain: their information was spot on, even if it came through mysterious origin. The Imperial captain in his tent pulls the stained white and gold armor from his chest. He places it on a wooden dummy and pulls a wet rag from a bowl beside it. He washes the bloodstains away from the elegant armor, shining it clean for the next encounter.\n\nHe’d been in many platoons led by captains with little care for their armor, or their men for that case. He will be different, though. The Captain pulls the headband from his forehead, letting his wavy brown hair fall in his face. No, he would be better than the shit-for-brains leaders he’s served under. The first step is looking the part. Easy enough. The second step, the one that will dictate the lives of his men, is a lot more difficult.\n\n“I can do that for you,” a girl’s voice meekly speaks from the back of the tent.\n\nThe Captain turns, forgetting Mira, his assigned “servant” is there. She stands behind him, hands clasped in front of her waist, her short “servant” dress revealing the entirety of her legs. She looks at the Captain with a pair of hazel eyes waiting for his reply, and likely his hands.\n\n“That won’t be necessary, Mira. I prefer to do it myself,” the Captain speaks. “If you have nothing else more pressing, I could use a drink though.”\n\nMira grabs for the pitcher of wine and pours it into a goblet. She offers it out for the Captain to take.\n\n“You can leave it on the table for now. Pour yourself one while you’re at it,” is his reply as he focuses most of his attention on cleaning his armor. Mira pours a second cup, but doesn’t drink from it just yet. She waits until the Captain finishes his work and picks his own cup from the table.\n\n“To the Empire’s victory,” the Captain salutes, clinking the two cups together.\n\n“Long live the Emperor,” Mira replies with less zeal. She takes a sip from the cup. The flavor bursts on her tongue like a bite into a fresh apple, by far the best drink she’s ever tasted.\n\n“Sorry we have to drink this horrid stuff. It’s all that’s available now. What I would give for a glass of brandy from the capital city…” the Captain says, mostly to himself than to Mira. “No matter. We will make due with what we have. Such is the way in conquest.”\n\n“Mhmm,” Mira agrees not sure what to say.\n\n“Finish your cup, now. I can tell you enjoy it,” the Captain says. “It’s my job to read people, you see. I must know the intentions of my soldiers, but more importantly, our enemies. I can tell you don’t like it here. I can also tell you don’t have any ill-will towards the Empire, except maybe towards unsavory characters. It’s ok, I realize not all in our leader’s employ follow his divine plan. I think the same way. Pour yourself another cup, now.”\n\nMira does as she’s commanded.\n\n“Good. Now enjoy yourself. I have to handle a few Imperial matters, but I’ll be back soon. Make yourself comfortable. I can tell that you and I are going to get along nicely, Mira,” the Captain says, smiling, and getting from his chair. He pours the remainder of his cup into Mira’s.\n\n“Thank you, Captain… Wren,” Mira says as he leaves.\n",
  "page 175": "Days later, Seth manages to rise from bed. Through a mouthful of Sarah’s wild rice soup, he says, “They knew we were coming. I don’t know how, but they knew. We turned the corner and they were there. A whole battalion of them.”\n\nHe fills his mouth with another spoonful. “I tried to fight them off. Luckily, Richard here is pretty handy with a bow. Nice timing too.”\n\nRichard sits to your left, his hand wrapped around a small cup of tea. He finishes the final gulp and refills the cup. “I’d been tracking the Empire’s movements for days. Had to make sure they didn’t venture too close to this place. I recognized Aeric’s men at once. The crimson robe, the one only close members of Aeric’s soldiers wear. Took down a few of them and extracted Seth in the confusion.”\n\n“Any ideas on how they knew you were coming? Is there a traitor within King Aeric’s ranks?” you ask.\n\nSeth shakes his head. “Doubt it. It’d be too difficult to pass messages in and out of the castle. Even if they just used signals, someone would catch on. It’s a sizable castle, but everyone’s in the know.”\n\nRichard chimes in. “This is the first I’ve seen Imperial troops wander off the main roads. Venturing off into unknown territory is usually something they avoid.”\n\n“Then what? Random chance?” you input.\n\n“Perhaps the Empire is looking for other ways into the castle, rather than the main gate,” Richard says.\n\n“Is there one?” you ask.\n\n“Not that I know of,” Seth answers. “Unless they want to climb up sheer mountainside.”\n\n“Or somehow hatch a litter of wyverns,” Richard jokes.\n\n“That’ll be the day,” Seth laughs.\n\nTurning the conversation back on track you say, “So where does that leave us? King Aeric banished me until I return with news of your raid. We must return at once.”\n\n“I wish we could, kid. I don’t fancy a climb back up sheer mountain just to receive a punishment and get locked inside a sieged castle. We’re better off staying in the open and taking the fight to the Empire.”\n\n“But it’s our duty.”\n\n“Don’t speak to me about duty! We’re out here because of our duty and loyalty to Aeric. I’m willing to protect my king by any means necessary -- even if that means disobeying a direct order from him in the process.”\n\n“What do you suggest we do then?” you ask.\n\n“Hit ‘em fast, hit ‘em hard,” Seth answers.\n",
  "page 156": "“I have lived long enough. This is not the first death caused by my shadow nature, and it likely won’t be the last if I remain living. I choose death.”\n\nThe crowd cheers. Not so long ago, they would do anything for you. The faces of the villagers you’ve helped countless times cry out in triumph at your death sentence. You don’t blame them. They don’t understand the full picture, but you’re glad. They will live on and the darkness within you will finally be silenced.\n\n“So be it,” Gilcrest answers. “Say your final words. Speak your peace, and we will remember you for the man you are, not the tainted blood within.”\n\nYou rise from the kneeling position, hands still bound to the post. “What they say is true. There is an evil that lives within me. I’ve done my best to hold it at bay, but even with my lifelong training, it still rears its ugly head. I am no different than any of you, though my actions may have greater consequences if chosen poorly. There is a battle within each self, one between good and evil, right and wrong. We are the same in that matter. I see your looks of hate. You look at me as if I’m the embodiment of evil. I did not choose this. Do you think I chose my lineage? Did any of you choose your parents? I’ve tried to do what is right. Nothing more, nothing less. If my death will bring benefit to you, if my death will put you in a safer position, then I am in accord. I do not fear death. I’ve battled it my entire life, witnessing my home, those who raised me slaughtered like beasts. Many of you experienced the same. If my death will bring a better world, then I am ready.”\n\nGilcrest unsheathes his weapon and raises it overhead. An arm stops him from finishing the blow. Kassi.\n\n“No,” she whispers. “It should be me.”\n\n“I can think of no one better,” you whisper back.\n\nKassi’s hand grips the back of your head, softly massaging your scalp with her fingers. Her face gets inches from yours. A breeze of air blows strands of bright blonde in-between you. She gazes into your eyes and yours into hers.\n\n“You know I would do anything for you, even this,” Kassi manages to say through a wavering voice.\n\n“I know, Kass. I know.”\n\nKassi’s lips meet yours, surprising you with warmth. Softly, tenderly you embrace the kiss, filling your senses with the taste of her lips. She drives her sword through your heart. The sharp pain, the loss of breath, you hardly notice. Your vision fades. The warmth of Kassi’s lips are replaced with coldness. The world is closing in now, tunneling your vision on to a single focus point. Kassi.\n",
  "page 157": "“I choose exile,” you say.\n\n“So be it,” Gilcrest answers pulling a knife from his belt. “I take no pleasure in this. You have chosen your fate, and I will respect your decision.”\n\n“You’ll not carve him up like some beast,” Kassi interjects.\n\n“You heard him yourself. This is not by my own choosing,” Gilcrest answers.\n\n“There wasn’t much of a choice. What man would choose death over exile? He’s done nothing but help you since we’ve arrived. If this is his reward, then I deserve the same,” Kassi replies kneeling next to you.\n\n“Kass. No,” you say. “This is my burden. I choose life, but it’s only just people know the danger I present them.”\n\n“You and I are one. If you are exiled, so am I. If you bear the mark, so will I. You chose for yourself. I’m doing the same,” Kassi reaffirms.\n\nBefore anyone can react, Kassi pulls a knife from her boot and carves into forehead, using her own sword as a mirror. In a matter of seconds, the mark of Ragar the Unbroken, your ancestor, bleeds down her face. Your decision has left her scarred and mutilated.\n\n“Get on with it then,” you say, clenching your jaw at seeing Kassi like this. Gilcrest grabs your face holding you in one place. The point of his knife carves into your forehead, inscribing the horrible mark for all to see.\n\n“Now begone with you. Death awaits you if you linger here longer.”\n\nYour bound hands are freed and your tunic is thrown at your feet. It’s ripped, but it’s better than nothing. You’re given your traveling gear and escorted out of the village. You place your arm around Kassi in attempt to reassure you both that you made the correct decision. One thing’s for certain, this is not the destiny you imagined when siding with your “allies.”\n\nYou set off into the forest along with Kassi, scarred, displaying the shameful mark for all to see. The two of you, together, just as it should be. You silently hope she doesn’t end up resenting you for the outcome. She chose, same as you. Still, it was your decision that put her in the circumstance. She would stand by you no matter what. Did you really think she would let you into exile without her?\n\nAfter everything you’ve been through, it’s just the two of you. Together. As it should be.\n",
  "page 44": "A few days later, you arrive at the base of the mountains. On the way, you had met with one of Vishal’s contacts who had a cart prepared full of freshly harvested fruits. Vishal explained you needed a valid reason to be crossing through the Edge. Vishal assumes the guise of merchant once again and you, Kassi, Yuri, and Gregory, the hired protection.\n\nYou turn a bend and the outpost appears before you. Built partly into the mountainside, you immediately understand the strategic location of the fort. No army would dare marching along the road. The road’s only wide enough for around 10 soldiers or so to march side by side. The treacherous conditions are too much for hauling siege equipment. Whoever controls the road has a firm hold on transporting troops and goods in and out of the territory. You couldn’t have chosen a better place to attack, at least not one that isn’t a castle full of soldiers. You focus on your breath to calm your nerves.\n\nWhen you approach the front gate a voice shouts out. “State your business or be on your way.”\n\nYou look up to see a woman with chestnut hair peering down at you.\n\n“I run an orchard on the outskirts of Estabrook,” Vishal answers. “The Emperor’s troops have kindly provided me with a wealth of business. So much, in fact, I can’t keep my trees producing quickly enough to meet the demands.”\n\n“Then what brings you to the Edge?”\n\n“Expansion,” Vishal smiles.\n\n“You have a lot of protection for an orchard farmer.”\n\n“Last harvest, one of my carts was set upon by resistance members. They stole an entire shipment ‘for the cause.’ I’ll not leave my cargo undefended any longer. Costs less to hire a few swords, than lose a whole cart.”\n\n“Can’t have too many swords nowadays,” the woman replies. “Follow the directions into the inspection zone. No sudden movements; our archers fire first, ask questions later.”\n\nThe gate swings open with a squeal. You cautiously enter into the fort. Above you, archers train their bows on the cart. Their steady hands, along with the confidence in their eyes, make you believe the woman’s threat is not a bluff. One of the fort’s guards leads the cart into an open area of the outpost.\n\nSatisfied any hidden attackers would be fully exposed, he pulls the canvas back uncovering the cart’s contents. Bright orange, red, and green shine in the morning sun. The fruit provided by Vishal’s contact fit your story. The soldier motions to the surrounding soldiers, and you see them ease up. The archers still keep their arrows nocked, but release their draw.\n\nA man with short cropped hair and graying beard approaches Vishal. “Greetings, farmer. I am the commander in charge. Will you join me in my office?”\n\n“What seems to be the problem, commander?” Vishal asks.\n\n“Nothing at all. I simply have a few questions for you. Not to worry, you’re completely safe here and can leave your hired help behind.”\n\n“Very well,” Vishal answers. He follows the commander for a few steps and then stops. “Commander, might I bring my niece and nephew with me? They are inexperienced and must be exposed to the world of men.”\n\n“They can come. Surrender your weapons to the Lieutenant.”\n\nThe woman who first yelled at you from the gate walks over and takes your swords. She exchanges a quick look with the commander. Vishal notices the look as well and you see his lips curl into a small smirk.\n\n“These are fine quality for people so ‘inexperienced,’” she comments.\n\n“Stays sharp if you never use it,” you answer with a smile.\n\nThe Lieutenant grunts a reply, which you can’t decipher, and nods to the commander. Vishal tosses her an apple on the way past. The commander leads you through a narrow tunnel. Soldiers salute as you pass by. The two stationed outside the office pat you for hidden weapons and then allow your entry.\n\nThe Commander sits into a leather-padded chair placed behind a sturdy-looking desk. His leather armor settles against the similar material at his back. He folds his hands on the desk.\n\n“You’re the first non-military traveler we’ve seen in months. How does the war fare for civilians?”\n\n“Good for business, bad for life-expectancy,” Vishal answers.\n\n“Such is the nature of war,” the Commander speaks. He trails off for a moment and then returns. “Listen, I did not bring you aside to discuss the hardship of war. I have a favor to ask.”\n\n“Which is?”\n\n“I have a letter for you to deliver. My wife and kids are in a small city on the outskirts of the capital.”\n\nVishal takes the sealed envelope and weighs it in the air.\n\n“Must be an important note. Must be long too, judging from the weight.”\n\n“It is. Listen, I hope I can depend upon your discretion. Do this for me and you’ll be in my favor. It’s no small thing to have favor from a commander in the Emperor’s employ.\"\n\n“You have yourself a deal,” Vishal shakes the commander’s hand. “By the way, do you have any idea when the war will end? I much prefer traveling without risk.”\n\n“Sadly, it doesn’t look like the conflict will end any time soon. Luckily, we’re quite a distance from the front lines.”\n\n“I’m sure you get your fair share of action. This is a key location for mobilization.”\n\n“Not as much as you’d think. The taking of this outpost would require substantial losses to their numbers.”\n\n“There’s that military mind of yours, always thinking in terms of numbers and superiority. You haven’t considered a well-defended spot such as this is vulnerable to a small team’s infiltration,” Vishal says.\n\n“Careful, farmer.”\n\n“All it takes is one poisoned apple, and you have an entire military fort at your disposal.”\n\nThe Commander’s face goes white. He remembers the apple Vishal tossed to the Lieutenant. He springs from his chair and grips Vishal by the collar. You and Kassi start to react, but Vishal waves you off.\n\n“Give me the antidote,” he spits.\n\n“I’m not daft enough to have it on me,” Vishal answers. “Then you could simply torture me for it.”\n\n“That’s not a bad idea.”\n\n“It is if you want your precious lieutenant to live.”\n\n“Fine,” the Commander loosens his grip. “What do you want?”\n\n“I want your undivided loyalty. You strike me as an honorable man and I’m willing to give you the antidote if you swear to me.”\n\n“What’s to stop me from killing you after I receive the antidote?”\n\n“Your honor, of course.”\n\nThe Commander releases his grip in defeat.\n\n“I swear my loyalty to you and your cause,” he speaks barely louder than a whisper. “Just give me the antidote.”\n\n“No need to look so downtrodden. I always take care of my friends,” Vishal says. “Now we must be off, I have a letter to deliver. You’ll receive the antidote later this week...along with your new orders.”\n\nWhen you arrive back to the wagon, you see the soldiers have eased up. A couple of them are even engaged in conversation with Yuri and Gregory. Now that you’re back in the open, your weapons are handed back. You strap your sword on and something feels different. The familiar weight feels off. You remove the blade and examine the sheath. Tucked between where your hilt and sheath meet is a piece of paper.\n\n“Everything ok?” Kassi asks noticing you removed the sword.\n\n“Yeah, just making sure those soldiers didn’t tamper with anything,” you reply.\n\nIn order to hold true to your story, you leave the Narrow’s Edge outpost and travel deeper into Empire territory. Vishal explained you’d spend have to spend at least a week there before returning back the way you came to Estabrook. Unsurprisingly, Vishal had people to meet during that time. Later that night during your watch, you unfold the piece of paper mysteriously attached to your sword.\n\nSwordmaster,\n\nI know who you are, survivor of the monastery massacre. Your talents are better spent on the battlefield, not parading as a spy’s personal bodyguard. I happen to know you’ll be in Searing Rock this week. There’s a tavern on the eastern wall, Craven’s Refuge. Meet me there if you’re interested.\n\nSigned, M.\n",
  "page 46": "Daybreak. Saul blinks his eyes open and looks at the lieutenant lying next to him. Her soft chestnut hair spreads on the pillow like a branching river. He gently swings his legs from the covers and places them on the cold stone floor. A hand suddenly grabs his wrist.\n\n“You’re leaving without saying goodbye?” the Lieutenant asks.\n\nDidn’t want to wake you, Mathers,” he whispers back. Saul rarely called Lieutenant Mathers by her first name. “Well, now that you’re up…”\n\nMathers sits up excited.\n\n“...do you mind helping me with my armor?” Saul finishes his statement to the obvious disappointment of Mathers.\n\n“Yes, Commander,” Mathers answers, staining her words with attitude. Saul could hear the eye-roll in her voice.\n\nSaul stands in front of the body-sized mirror with his arms out wide. The still naked Lieutenant Mathers begins to fasten the Commander’s armor to his body. Every now and then her movement would draw her into a clear view in the mirror\u0027s reflection. Each time Saul reminded himself of the importance of his position, to his inner desire’s disappointment. He worked hard to secure his position and wouldn’t throw it away for a morning of pleasure. There was always tonight.\n\nThe outpost in Narrow’s Edge is an important military position for the Empire. The thin road through the mountains is the quickest, most direct route through. The road sits between a sheer rock wall and a sudden drop off, which is how it was originally named. The military outpost controls traffic through the mountains, and Saul would have it well defended to protect the Empire.\n\nLieutenant Mathers finishes and gives Saul a gentle slap on the rear.\n\n“Go get ‘em, Commander,” she says playfully.\n\nSaul eyes himself in the mirror. The light leather of his armor is reinforced with a metal chestplate and pauldrons. The gold and white symbol of his emperor glints from the sun rays beginning to poke over the mountain peaks. His well-kept beard is starting to show signs of graying, something Mathers liked to remind him of. Saul knew the young lieutenant secretly adored the mature look, although he hoped it’s due to his military position and not the result of deeper father issues. He didn’t need emotional scarring to ruin what he considered to be a good thing.\n\nSaul exits the commander’s chambers. Two soldiers posted at the door salute as he passes. Saul marches along the top of the outpost walls taking stock of the fort. Despite the importance of the outpost, it could clearly be more reinforced. It certainly could afford another platoon or two. The Narrow’s Edge road runs directly through the fort. Two main gates sit on either side of the structure. High ramparts allow the inhabitants to see travelers far in advance of their arrival and isn’t a bad position for archers. Saul takes a deep breath of cool morning air and gazes over the cliff side. Small pockets of clouds hug tightly against the surrounding peaks. He silently promises himself that he will succeed in his new position. At all costs.\n",

  "page 40": "While you’ve shared a bed numerous times, you think climbing in unannounced might signal the wrong message to Kassi. You did not need to distract your minds with such thoughts before the mission. You refocus your mind on the monk’s teachings.\n\nYour physical body is not who you are. It’s merely a sanctuary for your Spirit. We train the body to be a better home for the Spirit to reside. Giving in to bodily pleasures are a denial of the Spirit. Protect the Spirit at all costs.\n\nYou know you require sleep, but put Kassi’s interests ahead of your own. You shut your eyes still sitting cross-legged. Meditation could last for hours in the monastery, so you weren’t unaccustomed to long periods of time spent in this position. You attempt to align your thoughts with the Spirit within.\n\nYour mind draws to your past. The countless hours spent training with Kassi before sunrise and after sunset. You had trouble keeping up at first, but each day you’d improve. Eventually, you arrived to the point where the training sessions were less one-sided and turned equally beneficial for each of you.\n\nYour thoughts continue to draw from your past, towards the days in the monastery. You feel as if you’re living the moments in real time. You find yourself in the training room, Kassi stands your opposition. The thin pad of the mat beneath your feet is a familiar texture. She charges toward you with her wooden dagger in attack position. You easily side-step the assault, at least that’s what she wants you to believe.\n\nYour step to the right brings you into the trap she set. One quick pivot brings the wooden dagger into your stomach and then gently touches your neck.\n\n“Yield,” she commands.\n\n“Nice move, Kass. I yield,” you say dropping your wooden sword. It falls and bounces a few times on the mat.\n\nThe wooden dagger presses harder into your neck.\n\n“I said yield,” Kassi says again. The way her voice deepened at the end sends a chill down your spine. It was not her voice, but otherworldly, sinister.\n\n“Kassi, what’s going on,” you start to say backing up.\n\nKassi’s face begins to distort. Her skin droops from her face, and her eyes turn black. She walks towards you flinching as if an unseen needle is piercing her body. Then you realize you’ve lost the ability to move. You try to cry out, and find your voice is gone as well. Frozen, dread falls over your body as if someone’s holding your head underwater.\n\nKassi walks up to you and stares into your eyes with two onyx beads within her skull. Her head tilts slightly. Then she breaks into a mad cackle as if mocking your inability to react. She holds one of her own fingers to your face and snaps it sideways. Her laugh intensifies with each finger she snaps. The pure white teeth within her mouth have turned to a decaying black. She holds her hand of broken fingers closer to your face. Her laugh splatters spit onto your face.\n\nSuddenly, she crumbles to her knees staring towards the floor. Her arms fold in her lap clutching the wounded hand supportively. The mad cackle slowly turns into light sobbing. You’ve never heard Kassi cry before, and hearing it for the first time brings tears to your own eyes. The power that prevents you from moving releases and you fall to all fours in front of her. You both sit there crying until you notice she’s stopped.\n\nYou slowly gaze towards her still-drooped head to see why the crying stopped. A figure, masked in shadowy wisps stands in front of you holding Kassi’s lifeless body. One of its arms reveals a curved blade. The shade slices upwards and splits Kassi’s body in half. The pieces fall on either side of you. It walks towards you, but does not use the blade. It places a hand to your cheek, almost as if consolation. Its touch feels like diving into a frozen lake. Then it grips around your neck and pulls you to its eye level. A slow, resonating laugh begins in your mind. Its hand curls around your neck tighter as the laugh grows deafening.\n\nYou awake to Kassi gripping both of your shoulders.\n\n“What?” you plainly ask.\n\n“Your body was shaking uncontrollably against the bedpost. It woke me up,” she says.\n\n“I had a nightmare, like the ones I had as a child.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” she touches your cheek. The act reminds you of the shade. “Come, let’s meditate until morning.”\n\nShe takes a seat next to you cross-legged. You try to refocus your mind on the Spirit, but all you can think about is the shade’s grip around your neck. You think of nothing else until sunrise.\n",
  "page 41": "You need sleep to be at your best tomorrow. You slowly pull the covers open and slither your way underneath. You peer towards Kassi to see if she’s still asleep. Her back is towards you, but you take her continuous breathing pattern to mean she didn’t wake. She shifts into a more comfortable position and her lower back softly presses into you.\n\nYou instantly focus your mind on the monk’s training. Your physical body is not who you are. It’s merely a sanctuary for your Spirit. We train the body to be a better home for the Spirit to reside. Giving in to bodily pleasures are a denial of the Spirit. Protect the Spirit at all costs.\n\nYou drift to sleep echoing the word “Spirit” over and over in your head and...\n\n...awake to find that it’s still dark. You still feel Kassi next to you. She begins to shift her position again, this time turning towards you.\n\n“Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake--” you start to say.\n\nAs she turns fully facing you, your heart briefly stops. Both of Kassi’s eyes are sewn shut with black thread. She appears to be crying out, and her open mouth is firmly locked into position with black needles piercing her jaw and cheekbones. Her body begins to float in the air, still prone, as if an invisible rope is attached to her waist. Kassi hangs in the air for a few seconds. Then her body begins to bend backward. Vertebrae by vertebrae, her back makes a sickening crunch as it folds unnaturally. As her full spine is completely broken, she falls limp, the power suspending her in the air completely gone. Kassi’s body bounces off the bed and flies to the floor in a single crash.\n\nParalyzed by an unseen power, you’re forced to watch the abomination before you. Mocking laughter begins to fill your head. The slow cackle is too much to bear after witnessing the scene before you. You attempt to scream, but your lungs remain void of air. Unable to move, unable to breathe, you shut your eyes and wait for the end.\n\nSearing pain brings you back. Two hooks pierce your shoulder blades and suspend your naked body in the air. You’re in a completely different room. The room is four evenly shaped walls built with square stone blocks. The surface beneath you is stained with your steady blood drip. You hear someone moving around behind you. Suddenly, the slack in the chains release, and you fall to the floor. Unprepared for the drop, you feel your ankle snap upon landing. You roll over to find Brother Samuel standing over your body holding a bucket. You attempt to cry out his name. He empties the bucket’s contents on top of you. Some gets in your mouth and you recognize the liquid. Oil.\n\nBrother Samuel lights a match and holds it in the air. “We’d be alive if you didn’t arrive at the monastery,” he spits. He drops the match on your oil-soaked skin. Immediately, the match bursts into flame and spreads over your skin. Brother Samuel watches you squirm and scream until the smoke blocks your intake of air. Your eyes meet his, and just before you see the world go black, he smiles.\n\nA firm grip on your shoulders shakes you awake. The shake is quickly followed by an open palm to your cheek. You sit up to find Kassi over you. Then you realize you’re on the floor not the bed.\n\n“What happened?” you ask rubbing your head.\n\n“I felt you moving in the night,” she answers. “I thought you were just getting handsy, so I kicked you to the floor. But then you kept shaking and I knew something was wrong.”\n\n“I had a nightmare, like the ones from my childhood,” you answer. “I dreamt of great evil.”\n\n“I hope it’s not a sign of things to come. Come, let’s meditate until morning.”\n\nShe grabs your hand and leads you to the foot of the bed. You both sit cross-legged and attempt to empty your mind of the night’s events. You try to focus on your Spirit, but all you can think of is the mocking laugh. It echoes within your head until morning.\n",
  "page 161": "You take your original position in the council and notice Seth giving you a look. He doesn’t hold it for long, though, apparently just wanting you to know he’s aware of your absence. You give him a slight shrug in acknowledgement.\n\n“So, Seth, can the raid be successful?” King Aeric asks through an ale-filled beard.\n\nSeth pulls a stray hair from his armored robe. “Of course, my king. The Emperor’s troops have gotten lazy in the past few years. I’m sure they’re just waiting us out until the Empire can free up more troops for a grand-scale siege. Right now, they’re content keeping us walled in. I’d be surprised if they’re even running drills down there.”\n\nAnother man, wearing the same colors as Seth chimes in. “Still, we must not act too hastily. If surprise is our best ally, we’d be foolish to squander it at an inopportune time.”\n\nKing Aeric addresses the new speaker. “Mordecai, you’ve remained quiet until now. Tell me what you think.”\n\nThe man, Mordecai, looks around the room. His long hair tied behind his head melts into the top of the robe. You can tell he hasn’t shaved in quite some time, despite the lack of full beard. Even though he wears the same robe as Seth, the attire of King Aeric’s inner circle, his personal upkeep is well the opposite of the clean-cut Seth.\n\n“I say patience, my king,” Mordecai says. “Let the Empire waste resources and manpower sitting at the bottom of our mountain. Eventually there will be a time to strike, but I’m not so certain it’s now. We can last here for many years.”\n\nSeth shakes his head in disagreement but doesn’t speak out.\n\n“I will make a decision in the morning. Dismissed,” King Aeric says, picking up the jug of ale.\n\nThe council members bow to the king and crowd towards the door. Seth makes straight for you, pushing aside an elderly advisor.\n\n“You, boy, follow me,” he says and exits the room, not waiting for your reply. The elderly advisor that was gently guided off course raises an eyebrow at you as if to say you better get going. You chase after Seth.\n",
  "page 160": "“Another unsuccessful breach!”\n\n“Ha! Those empire dogs are all bark, no bite.”\n\n“We should not be overconfident. We have nowhere to run should the empire find a way inside.”\n\n“This keep has never been conquered. The walls would hold firm even if the Emperor himself shows up.”\n\n“And what of the nation’s people? They are at the mercy of the Empire.”\n\n“They must understand our position. The storm of the empire must be weathered before any counter-attack can be mustered. They must endure.”\n\nThe throne room of King Aeric is ablaze with news of the most recent attack. For more than a decade, the Empire’s troops have tried, and failed, to capture the nation’s capital. King Aeric’s keep sits at the top of a mountain. It’s a nightmare for the king’s mobilization, but even worse for attacking armies. The keep sits at a high enough elevation that Aeric’s mages can easily pull the moisture in the air into drinkable water. The magically created food is an acquired taste, but it’s definitely better than starving.\n\n“It’s been long enough. We should start on the offensive!”\n\n“We should not decide hastily. One wrong plan could ruin us all.”\n\nThe room again erupts in debate. In the past years, you’ve become accustomed to the ale-empowered arguments of Aeric’s war council. You imagine Brother Samuel would enjoy these types of debates. The thought brings a tinge of sadness to your mind, but you quickly focus on your breath to clear the emotion.\n\n“Psst.”\n\nYou turn to see Estella, one of the apprentice mages. Her red curls stick out from behind the column.\n\n“What is it? We’re in the middle of a meeting,” you whisper, backstepping towards her nonchalantly.\n\n“Can you break away? I need your help with something.”\n",
  "page 163": "Seth strides quickly through the castle hallways. You follow at the same pace a distance behind him. You know he prefers to walk in silence, so there’s no point in running to catch up to him. He leads you down a familiar path; you arrive at the castle training grounds.\n\nThe room is much more luxurious than the practice room in the monastery, though that is the case for nearly every room in the castle. It is a castle, after all. Various weapons line the room, neatly placed on racks. Cloth towels are folded in the corner to wipe down sweat and equipment after use. It definitely made for a less musty smell than the practice room in the monastery. Something about the place felt fabricated, almost too orderly. Your brief experience with combat already revealed the chaotic nature of war. Keeping the place where you train for battle clean feels a little wrong like untrained nobles in extravagant armor.\n\nSeth, still silent, pulls two wooden swords from the wall. You expect him to toss one to you, but instead, he charges forward weaving the swords into an attack pattern. You dodge a swipe near your head, and block closely followed second with your bracer. Immediately, you push Seth back with a kick in order to gain some distance.\n\nSeth gathers himself and goes on the offensive again. He arcs the practice blades low and swings high. You roll to your side and pull the nearest training weapon from the wall. A staff. You spin the staff in front of you to feel the weight and balance of the weapon. Then you hold it in a defensive position, readying for Seth’s next attack.\n\n“Good, you’ve learned to adapt. Remember when I first brought you here? You danced around the room like a ballroom dancer. Running only guarantees your survival for a short while,” Seth says.\n\n“Short while? It’s been ten years,” you reply, thinking of the monastery.\n\n“That is why we must strike!” Seth pleads. “You can only remain defensive for so long. Eventually, and it will happen, the castle will be overrun. I’m not going to sit here and waste away. I’m gathering a small attack force. I hope you’ll join us, kid. Meet me back here at midnight if you’re in.”\n\nSeth drops the two wooden swords on the floor, not bothering to place them back on the wall. He exits the training grounds. You’re left alone to decide your course of action.\n",
  "page 162": "“Fine,” you whisper. “But this better be important. I’ll probably hear about my absence later.”\n\n“It’s...pretty important. Come on, the others are waiting,” Estella answers with a smile.\n\nYou follow Estella through the keep’s hallways. You cover your head with the hood of your cloak in order to not draw attention to yourself. After crossing the main hallway to the other wing of the keep, you arrive in one of the mage training rooms. It’s an open room with several magically enhanced dummies at the far end. The entire room, from floor to ceiling, is metal to prevent a stray fireball from burning down the place. A group of people huddling in the middle turn at your arrival.\n\n“Really? This is him?” one of the mages-in-training, Luther, asks. His tone doesn’t imply he expects much of you.\n\n“This is the best candidate we have. He’s from the monastery, he can handle himself,” Estella answers. She gently nudges you into the center of the group.\n\n“What’s all this about?” you ask. “I get the feeling you’re up to something your masters won’t want to hear.”\n\n“You’re not wrong -- we’ve come up with an experiment of sorts. Stand a little to your left please,” Estella says.\n",
  "page 165": "You do as she says. You look down and see the section of the floor you’re standing on is slightly charred. You take a deep breath and release any tension you’re holding on to. You didn’t think you were in any real danger, but it never hurts to be prepared.\n\n“We’re testing out a new spell. It’s nothing destructive, don’t worry. Well, not in the traditional sense of the word. It’s more like a willpower test of sorts,” Luther says.\n\n“Say the word, and we can stop whenever you’d like,” Estella affirms.\n\n“Fine, let’s get on with it. Consider us even for...you know,” you say to Estella.\n\nThe group of mages begin reciting the words of power in unison. The air around you becomes more dense as it imbues with arcane energy. Light flashes for a moment and then slowly dims. The arms waving in front of you, the mages, blur. Dizziness washes over you, and you blink your eyes repeatedly in an attempt to stabilize your vision.\n\n“How’s he doing?”\n\n“I think he’s ok.”\n\n“We’ve never made it this far. Should we keep going?”\n\n“Of course we should keep going!”\n\nVoices enter and exit your hearing, rising and falling in sound level. It’s starts loud, gets quiet, and finishes loud. The last voice you easily recognize as Luther’s. You struggle to stand and realize this might be your last chance to call it quits before something bad happens. By the mage’s comments, it doesn’t sound like they know what is happening.\n\nNo, you owe Estella a favor and trust her not to leave any permanent, damaging effects. You aren’t super close, but close enough where you don’t think she would willingly put you in harm’s way-- at least, not anything serious. You try to clear your senses. If you can focus on something real, then the illusionary effects might subside a bit. It’s not unlike the rope climb from the monastery; if you focus on the rope, and don’t look down, then it’s smooth sailing. You flash a quick thumbs up.\n\n“See? Told you he could handle himself,” you hear Estella say. Her words are the last thing you hear before the world spins into nothingness.\n\nWhirling darkness becomes your reality. Incoherent whispers surround your ears, fading in and out of existence. You’re lightless as if a storm cloud in the still night. You find yourself in the monastery’s courtyard. The giant angelic statue overshadowing the courtyard is pure and without cracks, opposed to the scarred structure you were used to seeing. The Grandmaster is sitting on a bench next to a youthful man. You will yourself forward towards the two men.\n\n“This news is most troubling,” the Grandmaster says.\n\n“It cannot be true,” the young man says. “The lineage of the Unbroken should have died centuries ago.”\n\n“The same could be said for Osborne, and yet, here we are,” the Grandmaster answers. “Keep this to yourself. I have a feeling your part in this is only just beginning.”\n\nThe Grandmaster looks up in thought, then his eyes squint in focus. “Come, I’m afraid there are listening ears here. We’ll continue this discussion in my study.”\n\nThe young man stands up and stretches out his arms. His light blue eyes glint in the sunlight. “The famous study, you honor me, Grandmaster. These benches make my back stiff anyway.”\n\nThe Grandmaster places a hand on the young man’s shoulder. “You’ll get used to it, Samuel.”\n\nTwo hands shake you from the vision. Light fills your eyes and you see red curls. Estella. You sit up, suddenly, and see the other mages are gone.\n\n“What happened?” you ask.\n\n“You started reciting the same sentence over and over,” Estella says. “I stopped the other mages and kicked them out.”\n\n“Thanks. What was the sentence?”\n\n“‘We must preserve the divine bloodline.’ Does that mean anything to you?”\n\n“Can’t say that it does. I’d better get back to the council room,” you say, rising to your feet. “And Stella?”\n\nShe looks at you expectantly.\n\n“Next time just let me repay you in silver.”\n",

  "page 101": "Midday sun. The bodies piling up on the bride are nearing the height of the structure. Pretty soon, the ground below will be overflowed with the dead. Still, the Imperial troops march on. The battering ram consistently clashes over the rain of arrows hitting the shielded troops.\n\n“It’s time,” the Emperor decides. His wyvern, the largest of the group, roars into the air. The others, enticed by their leader, rear their heads too. The beasts fire into the air, snarling, eager for battle. The wyverns fly fast and low, using the bridge as cover. They weave seamlessly through the columns, staying out of arrow range.\n\nUpon reaching the base of the castle, the wyverns fly directly upward, hugging close to the castle walls. The Imperial army, energized by their leader’s assault, rally and continue their siege on the main gate. The ram clashes against the gate. Men thrown from the ramparts by the wyverns scream as they fall past the bridge.\n\nClash. Arrows and spears, aimed at the winged creatures, miss harmlessly as the riders avoid the return fire. Clash. The Emperor flings bolts of flame at the defending soldiers, causing chaos within their ranks. Clash. A crack in the gate appears. Clash. Two of the wyvern riders swarm a ballista and rip the anti-siege machine apart. Clash. The gate is breached!\n\nYou watch the battle unfolding before you from the other side of the bridge. There’s not much you can do before the gate is breached. The main force of the army gathers, uniformly, in line. The first few soldiers rushing into Aeric’s castle are met with spears and arrows. Eventually, due to sheer number and continuous flowing, the Emperor’s troops start to overwhelm the defenders. You motion to Captain Wren. It’s time to join the battle. As you make your way to cross the bridge, the Emperor lands in front of you with a few other riders behind him.\n\n“Not so fast, my friend. I can’t have you run about as a normal foot soldier. Climb on.”\n\nThe riders behind the Emperor motion the same to Captain Wren, Dodgey, Rexxus, and Big Sue. The wyverns take the same flight path to the castle, weaving between the bridge’s support columns. As you fly up the castle walls, you can’t help but admire the view below. Despite the violence, the view below is like a painting. The white-gold rush of Imperial soldiers blend into the drab, earthy defending force like fire spreading over a parchment. The Emperor drops you off atop the castle walls.\n\n“Go! Take out as many as you can. I will join you inside with the main force.”\n\nYou shield your eyes from the gust of wind caused by the Emperor’s takeoff. There’s a single doorway at the opposite side of the walkway. After receiving the “ok” nod from Captain Wren, you enter into King Aeric’s castle.\n\nStone walls line the interior. While not nearly a fraction of the elegant Imperial capital, Aeric’s castle isn’t un-elegant. Simple banners hang from the walls displaying the various clans and families aligned to King Aeric. It’s clear that the place was built for defense rather than looks. The hallway is empty of soldiers, and you’re careful not to be loud enough to fill it. You follow the passageway to the end of the hall and then turn the corner. There, you find a very surprised-looking mage.\n",
  "page 189": "The company strides into the castle’s interior. Several gaps in the walls allow you to see the forest surrounding the structure. An entire tower lays shattered on the ground, its stone blocks spread out like a fortune teller’s seeing bones. The overgrown grass rises to your mid-thigh making the journey slow as you scan the ground for buried stones, but more importantly, traps. The main door to the castle has far deteriorated past usefulness, leaving the entrance wide open. Seeing as there is not another way in, you enter the ruins.\n\nDarkness.\n\nSparks fill the lightless interior igniting the hand torch. Not every man holds one, but the torches are positioned well throughout the line of men to illuminate each man’s vision. Fallen braziers line the walls, along with crumpled tapestries.\n\n“Travel slowly. We don’t know what awaits us,” you say to the company.\n\nYou signal to move forward. Suddenly, the castle halls fill with a slow, resonating laugh. Dark shadows fly above you, not more than a blur. The torches extinguish simultaneous, leaving you in darkness. You hold your weapon out, defensively, but do not aimlessly swing for fear of striking an ally. Not everyone holds the same resolve, and you hear the clash of swords along with cries from those wounded.\n\n“What madness is this?” you hear Seth’s voice speak.\n\n“Die, Imperial dog!” a man shouts.\n\n“Mama? No don’t hurt mama no more!”\n\n“Shut your fucking mouth. Bleed. Bleed. Fucking BLEEED!”\n\nIt’s then that you realize the mental attack taking place. Each member of the company is seeing a vision, an illusionary attack on their willpower. The world fades in and out, sound gets louder than quiet. A pair of hands grip your throat and forcefully pull you in the air. Your face is close to your adversary, and you faintly see the features of Seth, his eyes narrowing as they meet yours.\n\n“Ragar!” he spits. “The Unbroken will never return.”\n\nYou twist from his grasp, but don’t attack just yet.\n\n“Come to your senses! Can’t you see it’s nothing more than a trick?” you plead.\n\n“I will do what I must to end the lineage. I hoped the rumors weren’t true,” Seth answers with the swing of his swords.\n\nThough dark, the sound of the blades traveling through the air kicks your instincts into gear. You instantly step backward, ducking and covering your face. The twin swords swing just above your head, sending a rush of air to your face.\n\n“What rumors do you speak of? It’s me! I’ve faithfully followed you ever since the day of the massacre,” you say.\n\n“Silence, demon,” Seth says tackling you to the floor.\n\nYou hit the ground hard. Too hard. The decaying castle floor gives way to your impact. You tumble through darkness in a storm of wood, stone, and ceramic. You land, getting the wind knocked from your lungs. A crash and groan nearby alerts you that Seth has similarly hit the bottom of...wherever this is.\n\nAn unseen force pulls your body in the air as if a rope was tied around your waist. The room bursts with light. Magic lamps lining the walls turn on, filling the room with their crimson glow. Your body floats up higher, then shifts vertical allowing you to see. Seth’s body lies unmoving on the floor, a large boulder rests on his lower half. You’re in an armory. Shelves of swords, battle axes, spears, and shields span the entire room. Your eyes scan the room for the unseen assailant. They find a gnarled staff, a wrinkled hand gripping it tightly.\n\nDo not fear me, child.\n\nFrom beyond the veil, the voice speaks from underneath a dark hood. The red shadows cast by the lamps outline the entire hunched figure in a sanguine glow.\n\n“You speak as if ally, yet your actions speak otherwise. Who are you?” you say, still suspended in the air.\n\nI do not expect you to discern. Instead, I will show you.\n",
  "page 100": "“My king. They are here!” the baby-faced squire exclaims, rushing into the throne room. He instantly places his hands on his knees to catch his breath.\n\n“Of course they’re here,” King Aeric spits. “They’ve been knocking at the door for four decades now.” The slight slurring of his words alert the throne room the cup in his hand isn’t his first, though in the King’s defense, his hand was rarely empty. King Aeric rises from the throne. His back hunched, he points a bony finger at the squire.\n\n“Get this pup out of my presence. This is a place for real men.”\n\nTwo guards at the entryway not-so-gently lift the squire under his arms and toss him through the door. They slam the door shut behind him. The slam echoes, intensifying the silence insueing in the room.\n\n“Does that mean I need to leave as well?” a woman’s voice rings out.\n\nThe woman sits cross-legged in a chair not designed for someone to sit cross-legged in. Her knees stick out underneath the arm rests displaying her flexibility. The loose bun tied behind her head is bright blonde. Her face, though youthful for her age, is starting to show signs of wrinkles.\n\n“Kassi, my dear. You’re always welcome in my hall,” King Aeric answers.\n\nTwo men swing open the throne doors, both dressed in dark red. One is clean-kempt with a buzzed head, and the other looks as if he hasn’t touched a razor in years.\n\n“It’s bad, my king,” Seth says. “Mordecai’s birds spotted wyverns.”\n\n“Pfft, ‘wyverns.’ They’re all long-gone by now,” King Aeric scoffs.\n\n“It is true, my king,” the other man, Mordecai, says. “And it gets worse. The Emperor himself is here, along with your little friend,” he directs the last part to Kassi.\n\n“He’s here?” Kassi sits up and uncrosses her legs.\n\n“Good. All my enemies have come to me. Saves me weeks of riding. Ready the defenses. Today we kill an emperor,” King Aeric says. The slurred speech seems to have disappeared.\n",
  "page 188": "“We should be close now,” Seth comments from the head of the group. You travel single file through the forest, guided by directions from the tribal member. There are twenty of you (give or take), dressed in varying colors from previous allegiances. The company of freedom fighters doesn’t have the well-coordinated march or attire of Imperial soldiers, save for the few that defected, but when it comes to battle coordination, there are few that can stand with you. It’s not hours of drilling that guides you, it’s battle-hardened soldiers with the instinct for war. Those that joined the company lacking the instinct didn’t stay long. Anyone who wanted to oppose the Empire could join, only ones with an aptitude for combat stayed.\n\nFrom behind a tree, a man steps out, silent and stern. The cloak at his back rises high, covering the lower half of his face. “It’s just through here. The forest opens to clearing. The ruins are there. No sign of activity.”\n\n“Good work, Horne. Keep an eye on the perimeter. I’d like some sort of warning if others will be joining us,” Seth answers.\n\nThe man, Horne, bows his head slightly and disappears back in to the forest. Even with your years of training, you barely hear his footsteps. Horne’s ability to melt into his surroundings are almost supernatural, a ghost silently watching from the outside.\n\n“What do you think we’ll encounter in there?” one of the men behind you speaks, though not too loudly.\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” you answer. “Our task remains the same. This shaman has proved a valuable asset to the Empire. Striking him down will be a significant blow to the beast.”\n\n“Do you think the castle is really haunted?” another asks.\n\nBefore you can answer, another man chimes in. “It’s just tribal nonsense. They pray to the earth and worship the sun. I bet the ‘demon’ is nothing more than a rogue sorcerer taking refuge in the ruins.”\n\n“Even if that is the case, taking down a caster is no easy task, especially in his home. Who knows what magical traps and surprises lie in wait,” you say.\n\n“No easy task? What would you call that business in Leifhelm then? Or the Imperial mage in Felgrown Keep? And the conjurer in Vern?--\"\n\nYou cut off the man before he can continue. “Past success doesn’t promise future victories. In each of those cases, it may have been my blade finishing the task, but every man here played their part. Keep your blade sharp…”\n\n“…and your mind sharper,” the company echoes.\n\n“Leadership suits you,” Seth whispers, too soft for the others to hear. “You would have made a fine commander in the king’s army.”\n\n“No use in thinking about that now. Look, there are the ruins,” you whisper back, eyeing the crumbling stone and scattered rocks in the overgrown grass. The archway, where a gate once sat, lies open, inviting you in, promising safe shelter.\n\nHE’S HERE\n\nThe voice appears in your mind. You shake it off, using your breath to focus on the present moment rather than the internal whispers. The demon awaits.\n",
  "page 103": "No words are shared between you and your squad. You move into attack position. The mage, thinking the same thing, weaves his hands into a casting position. Dodgey and Rexxus lead with their defenses raised, allowing room for you to close the distance without fear of the arcane assault. The robed arms finish their motion, and a blast of flame projects down the corridor in your direction. The fire hits the light kite shields carried by the guardians. You run into a wave of warm air as you rush past the two defending members.\n\nYour movement alerts the mage as you come into fun view, running in front of Rexxus and Dodgey. The mage pulls the talisman hanging from his neck for a quick burst of energy, rather than taking the time to cast. Before he can finish the action, Captain Wren’s short spear impales through his bicep, pinning his arm to his side. The tip of your sword meets his chest a couple quick steps later.\n\n“Damn it. We’re supposed to take them alive,” Captain Wren says.\n\n“Not to worry, Captain. There’ll be others,” you reply.\n",

I will join you inside with the main force.”\n\nYou shield your eyes from the gust of wind caused by the Emperor’s takeoff. There’s a single doorway at the opposite side of the walkway. After receiving the “ok” nod from Captain Wren, you enter into King Aeric’s castle.\n\nStone walls line the interior. While not nearly a fraction of the elegant Imperial capital, Aeric’s castle isn’t un-elegant. Simple banners hang from the walls displaying the various clans and families aligned to King Aeric. It’s clear that the place was built for defense rather than looks. The hallway is empty of soldiers, and you’re careful not to be loud enough to fill it. You follow the passageway to the end of the hall and then turn the corner. There, you find a very surprised-looking mage.\n",
  "page 105": "“My king. They are here!” the baby-faced squire exclaims, rushing into the throne room. He instantly places his hands on his knees to catch his breath.\n\n“Of course they’re here,” King Aeric spits. “They’ve been knocking at the door for four decades now.” The slight slurring of his words alert the throne room the cup in his hand isn’t his first, though in the King’s defense, his hand was rarely empty. King Aeric rises from the throne. His back hunched, he points a bony finger at the squire.\n\n“Get this pup out of my presence. This is a place for real men.”\n\nTwo guards at the entryway not-so-gently lift the squire under his arms and toss him through the door. They slam the door shut behind him. The slam echoes, intensifying the silence insueing in the room.\n\n“Does that mean I need to leave as well?” a woman’s voice rings out.\n\nThe woman sits cross-legged in a chair not designed for someone to sit cross-legged in. Her knees stick out underneath the arm rests displaying her flexibility. The loose bun tied behind her head is bright blonde. Her face, though youthful for her age, is starting to show signs of wrinkles.\n\n“Kassi, my dear. You’re always welcome in my hall,” King Aeric answers.\n\nTwo men swing open the throne doors, both dressed in dark red. One is clean-kempt with a buzzed head, and the other looks as if he hasn’t touched a razor in years.\n\n“It’s bad, my king,” Seth says. “Mordecai’s birds spotted wyverns.”\n\n“Pfft, ‘wyverns.’ They’re all long-gone by now,” King Aeric scoffs.\n\n“It is true, my king,” the other man, Mordecai, says. “And it gets worse. The Emperor himself is here, along with your little friend,” he directs the last part to Kassi.\n\n“He’s here?” Kassi sits up and uncrosses her legs.\n\n“Good. All my enemies have come to me. Saves me weeks of riding. Ready the defenses. Today we kill an emperor,” King Aeric says. The slurred speech seems to have disappeared.\n",
  "page 104": "The mage begins to weave his hands drawing on arcane power. Instead of attacking, you hold out your arms and shout “Wait!” Surprisingly, or perhaps unsurpringing since you chose the action, the mage stops casting and looks at you quizzically.\n\n“Give me one reason why I shouldn’t blast you into oblivion,” the mage says with a rather displeased tone.\n\n“Give us a reason why we shouldn’t slit your throat,” Rexxus answers. Big Sue looks amused at the answer. Dodgey rolls his eyes.\n\n“I will not be spoken to with such disrespect,” the mage replies. His hands move back into the weaving pattern. Rexxus gives you a small shrug. You charge forward, removing your blade from its sheathe. The mage finishes his casting and fires a ball of flame directly at you. You side-step to the left as the molten projectile flies past in a small wave of warm air. The end of the hallway shutters in the impact of the fire spell. Now, defenseless, the mage raises his arms up and repeats your shout.\n\n“Wait!”\n\n“That trick only works once,” you say. Your blade finds his throat.\n",

  "page 106": "Midday sun. The bodies piling up on the bride are nearing the height of the structure. Pretty soon, the ground below will be overflowed with the dead. Still, the Imperial troops march on. The battering ram consistently clashes over the rain of arrows hitting the shielded troops.\n\n“It’s time,” the Emperor decides. His wyvern, the largest of the group, roars into the air. The others, enticed by their leader, rear their heads too. The beasts fire into the air, snarling, eager for battle. The wyverns fly fast and low, using the bridge as cover. They weave seamlessly through the columns, staying out of arrow range.\n\nUpon reaching the base of the castle, the wyverns fly directly upward, hugging close to the castle walls. The Imperial army, energized by their leader’s assault, rally and continue their siege on the main gate. The ram clashes against the gate. Men thrown from the ramparts by the wyverns scream as they fall past the bridge.\n\nClash. Arrows and spears, aimed at the winged creatures, miss harmlessly as the riders avoid the return fire. Clash. The Emperor flings bolts of flame at the defending soldiers, causing chaos within their ranks. Clash. A crack in the gate appears. Clash. Two of the wyvern riders swarm a ballista and rip the anti-siege machine apart. Clash. The gate is breached!\n\nYou watch the battle unfolding before you from the other side of the bridge. There’s not much you can do before the gate is breached. The main force of the army gathers, uniformly, in line. The first few soldiers rushing into Aeric’s castle are met with spears and arrows. Eventually, due to sheer number and continuous flowing, the Emperor’s troops start to overwhelm the defenders. You motion to Captain Wren. It’s time to join the battle. As you make your way to cross the bridge, the Emperor lands in front of you with a few other riders behind him.\n\n“Not so fast, my friend. I can’t have you run about as a normal foot soldier. Climb on.”\n\nThe riders behind the Emperor motion the same to Captain Wren, Dodgey, Rexxus, and Big Sue. The wyverns take the same flight path to the castle, weaving between the bridge’s support columns. As you fly up the castle walls, you can’t help but admire the view below.

Since the Empire’s founding, we have been in opposition to its tyranny. Figures of great importance, too afraid to face the Empire in open war, quietly made secret alliances biding their time. They understood the destruction of the beast would take a powerful blow, and I believe the time is upon us. Vishal was a member of our organization before splitting apart.

The inner courtyard, littered by the dead, is a remnant of its once pure state. Stone benches are stained red and chipped. The lush, well-maintained plants are trampled and left broken. The defending force, starting to realize the futility of their efforts, retreat deeper into the castle.\n\nThe Emperor’s wyvern lands in the center of the courtyard. The beast screeches into the air, terrorizing the fleeing soldiers even more. Green eyes from atop the wyvern stare directly into the statue of King Aeric. The statue, looming over the front entrance, is a symbol of King Aeric’s watchful gaze and protection. Travelers, diplomats, and artisans all know of the famed statue. The symbolic nature of the stone and Aeric’s unmoving, unbeatable defense is built into the statue. All know it, especially the Emperor. In a whisper, a dark flame appears in his hand. Outstretching his arm, the shadow bolt flies through the air removing the statue’s head from its body.\n\nThe Imperial troops cheer at the sight and rally forward. The day is theirs. Today, they kill a king. The Emperor’s lips curl into a smile at one corner. Today, is the return of the Unbroken. The true Unbroken.\n",

  "page 50": "Just as the note said, your journey with Vishal takes you to Searing Rock. The city lies at the base of a dormant volcano. You can think of many places you’d rather build a city than at the base of a volcano. When voicing it to Yuri, he offers a reasonable explanation.\n\n“Some folks figured out to use the place for smithing. They built several deep underground forges. The city just sort of built around them.”\n\n“Might as well be building on sand,” Kassi comments.\n\nVishal leads your small band to a middle-class inn to keep appearances, even though he could afford the nicest place in the city. As his “niece and nephew,” you and Kassi get your own room. You practice your daily forms in the room, this one having more floor space than the dinky room in Estabrook. Once Kassi is asleep, you quietly sneak out. You thought about asking her to come with you, after all, you did everything together, but you decided it best she could speak her uninvolvement, truthfully, if things turned south.\n\nYou navigate through the city streets towards the eastern wall. After being the recipient of two drunken threats, invitation from an alley whore, and catching a thief’s hands in your pocket (one of them was promptly removed), you see the sign for Craven’s Refuge. The two-story structure is partly attached to the city wall behind it. The inside is almost pitch black. Seating booths line the walls. Features are hard to distinguish, and you assume that is by design. A well-dressed man in black greets you upon entry.\n\n“Reservation?” he asks. The tone of his voice subtly suggests he knows the answer to his question.\n\n“I believe that’s been arranged. I’m here to see M,” you answer.\n\nThe man’s gaze briefly floats to your sword before returning.\n\n“Very well. The lady will see you now. Please do not do anything to disturb the other guests.”\n\nThe man leads you to the back corner of the room. As you pass by various booths and tables, guests pause their conversation until you’re out of range to hear. He brings you to a booth at the far wall that looks exactly like the others. Both seats are empty and the man motions for you to sit on the right side. You take your seat and wait patiently. Suddenly, the seat swivels 180 degrees and the shadowy interior is replaced with a normally lit room. Your seat is facing a familiar woman: Lieutenant Mathers.\n\n“Narrow’s Edge not treating you well enough?” you ask.\n\n“Heh, it has its moments. Like, for example, when the entire military outpost was brought to its knees by a single woman’s actions,” she answers.\n\n“I take it you’re not simply a lieutenant in the Empire’s army.”\n\n“Now where in the world would you come up with that crazy idea?” Seeing your unchanged reaction to her sarcasm, she continues. “Sorry, I forget that you’re young and haven’t experienced the world much.”\n\n“I’ve seen my fair share. I’ve experienced enough to know that having a strong sword arm and close allies are necessary for survival,” you reply.\n\n“Hmm, perhaps I was wrong to judge your blank look as naivety. I suppose you’re also someone who would rather get straight to the point instead of dancing around the edges. That’s why you’re here. I’m taking the fight straight to the Emperor. I’m done with bleeding the Empire slowly. I want to remove its head with a single blow.”\n\n“Easier said than done,” you comment.\n\n“True,” Mathers says. “But a lot easier with a high ranking officer at your disposal.”\n\n“Where do I come into all of this? There are plenty of swords to hire.”\n\n“None like you.”\n\n“Flattery won’t help. I have a realistic notion of my skill and its relation to others. I have never faced a superior opponent since leaving the monastery, but that does not mean superior opponents don’t exist.”\n\n“I’m glad you mentioned the monastery. Don’t you want to know how I learned of your survival?”\n\n“I did not survive alone.”\n\n“Yes, I know. The girl had no small part in the matter, but it’s ultimately you I am, and the Empire, is interested in.\"\n\n“Why? Kassi and I are equals.”\n\n“Ha-ha! The monks never told you, did they? Oh this is just too good. How do you think you arrived there in the first place?”\n\n“As a child, I told myself loving parents gave me up in hopes for a better life, though even then, I knew that was a lie. I knew I was different from the other kids. The monks never shared the details, and I have no memory before arriving. My current state leads my actions, my past’s details are less important.”\n\n“If I didn’t read the reports myself, I think you would make a solid argument. Your past is more important than you assume.” Her face darkens. “--because it’s what haunts you now.”\n\nMathers’ words paralyze you. Your mind wanders to your night in Estabrook, to your nightmare.\n\n“What report?” you manage to ask.\n\n“Kid, you look like you’ve seen a ghost, although this is you, so that wouldn’t be too far-fetched. Tell me, what do you know of the first Emperor, Ragar?”\n",
  "page 53": "“What does the story have to do with me?” you ask.\n\n“You can’t be that thick-headed. There is only one reason I’d tell you that story,” Mathers replies. “You’re a descendent of Ragar the Unbroken.”\n\n“Surely, you can’t be serious,” you say.\n\n“It’s the truth.”\n\n“There must be others then. Ragar lived hundreds of years ago.”\n\n“Mm, perhaps there are others. Rumor is the current Emperor might be. Siblings that don’t end up ruling tend to be disposed of: rivalries, throne claims, and all that.”\n\n“How did you come by this knowledge?”\n\n“Most know the legend of Ragar the Unbroken. Not many know the tragedy of Princess Catherine, but that’s a story for another time.”\n\n“I still don’t understand how I fit into any of this. I’ve been fighting the Empire almost my whole life.”\n\n“Join me, and we will bring the Empire crumbling down. No more of this ‘thorn in their side’ bullshit. I will strike a blow not even the Empire cannot recover from.”\n",
  "page 190": "Prince Ragar strides through the castle hallways. His dark hair, tied at the back of his head, bounces with each step. Soldiers bring a fist to their heart as he passes by, and in return, Ragar gives a slight nod of appreciation, more in habit than actual gratitude. The news on his mind is most troubling, too troubling for him to give full attention to the guardsmen.\n\nTreachery, by King Osborne’s most trusted advisor no less. No, Prince Ragar did not have time for the common soldier. He swings open the double doors to the castle’s chapel and sees his target by the main altar, surrounded by dozens of lit candles, most of which are bathed in melted wax. His target remains focused on the altar, leaning on a gnarled staff, and dressed in ceremonial white.\n\n“Lorthander!” Ragar shouts. “You will answer for your crimes against the crown.”\n\nRagar’s target turns, pulling the hood from his head, revealing his face. Wrinkles span his cheeks. Horizontal lines, evenly spaced apart, rise from his eyebrows to hairline. His green eyes sparkle innocently, not moved by the apparent threat before him.\n\n“What crime would that be, my prince?” Lorthander speaks through his raspy voice.\n\n“Necromancy and forbidden rituals. The King has outlawed dark magic of any kind,” Ragar says, drawing his sword. “I urge you to come in peace. You’ve been like an uncle to me, ever since my birth. Don’t make this harder than it already is.”\n\n“Step to the altar, prince. See what I see,” Lorthander answers. “Everything I do, I do for the lineage of your father, of you, Prince Ragar.”\n\nEyeing Lorthander cautiously, Prince Ragar takes the steps to the altar. He holds his sword in front of him, searching for signs of deception, ready to strike if Lorthander proves enemy.\n\n“The scroll. Read it,” Lorthander rasps.\n\nPrince Ragar looks to the piece of parchment laid on the altar. A long strand of dark hair falls loose from the tie behind his head, covering his eye. His lips mumble incoherent words as he finishes reading the scroll.\n\n“No, it can’t be,” he whispers.\n\n“It’s true, my prince. Your father, King Osborne is using dark magic to preserve his life, the lives of refugees sacrificed to lengthen his lifetime. Funny, and you were ready to put me to the sword for the exact same thing.”\n\n“Well -- this could be falsified. How do I know this to be true?”\n\n“I perform the ritual myself. You are right, my prince. I take part in rituals of dark magic at the command of the King, your father. Care to see the proof for yourself?”\n\nPrince Ragar nods.\n\n“Very well, then. Follow me.”\n\nLorthander grips the staff and walks towards an angelic statue. Every other step sends an echo in the room, caused by the staff hitting the floor. Prince Ragar walks closely behind. At one marble sculpture of a seraph, Lorthander closes his eyes and speaks words of the incantation. The wings of the seraph, stretched out, close in as if preparing for take-off. The sculpture fades into nonexistence, revealing the staircase underneath. Lorthander motions for Prince Ragar to descend, and the prince confidently steps down first.\n\nThe bottom of the staircase opens into a large room filled with rows and rows of cages, far as the eye can see. Lorthander waves his fingers illuminating the room in red light. To his horror, Prince Ragar sees that most of the cages are filled with people. Their bony wrists hang pinned against the cells in a \"T\" shape, which only draw more attention to their lack of nourishment. Each prisoner is on the verge of starvation, and not even a loin cloth covers their shame. The prisoners are naked, dying, and don’t even react to Lorthander and Prince Ragar as they’ve given up hope.\n\n“What new evil is this?” Prince Ragar whispers.\n\n“The command of your father. He was very strict about not gathering kingdom civilians, but war refugees? That’s another matter,” Lorthander answers. “My prince, I do not like it. I wish I could stop it, but I’m faithful to the throne. I hope things will be different when you’re king...if Osborne ever dies.”\n\nPrince Ragar, realizing Lorthander’s message speaks, “Am I destined to forever be a prince, always at my father’s heel? It’s not right. It’s not natural.”\n\n“Then the kingdom is worse off, not having you as king. I’ve known you all your life, prince. You would make a great king.”\n\n“I will make a great king,” Prince Ragar affirms. “My father’s atrocities must be stopped.”\n\n“Are you the one to stop him? The King is powerful, and the hammer at his side is deadly.”\n\n“I don’t know. I must.”\n\n“My work for your father revealed another ritual, one that could give you the edge. Your blood, prince, the power within is not fully realized. I can unlock that power for you. Your father, the false king refused it. You are far more understanding than him.”\n\n“And the cost?” Prince Ragar asks.\n\nLorthander motions to the prisoners in the cages. “All of them.”\n\nPrince Ragar ponders a moment. “There’s no telling how many more my father would continue to kill with an extended lifetime. It could be infinite. Their one-time sacrifice will not be in vain. I will be a better king than my father. Do it.”\n\n“As you wish...my king.”\n",
  "page 52": "Flames. The world before Ragar is consumed by the arcane inferno. His soldiers run through the capital city, slaughtering men and performing acts on women, desperately wishing for the blade instead of the next soldier in line. Ragar’s black hair flows in the wind. His view atop the wyvern gives him full vantage over the battle. Laughing, he casts another fireball into a nearby church tower. The ringing bell is silenced in a short burst of collapsing stone and metal. Straight ahead of him, though masked by the burning city’s smoke, lies the stronghold tower of King Osborne.\n\nEven a mere glance at the king’s stronghold builds rage inside Ragar.\n\nHE BETRAYED ME!\n\n“He betrayed me,” Ragar lifelessly speaks. His voice is drowned out by the battle below. With a snarl, he guides the wyvern towards the tower. He doesn’t care that the act will put him into enemy lines, far beyond the reach of his army. Osborne is near and Ragar will have his revenge.\n\nArrows and arcane projectiles fly through the air at him. They dissolve into the barrier of dark magic Ragar maintains around the winged beast. Ragar allows them to keep firing into his shield. As he nears a siege weapon, he unleashes the stored energy burying the weapon and surrounding soldiers in a heap of rubble.\n\nTerror begins to spread in the minds of the defending soldiers. Ragar the Unbroken is here!\n\nRagar has little trouble navigating to the throne room. The pitiful soldiers tasked with defending their king fall at a simple wave of Ragar’s hand. He raises their dead bodies up in hopes they might offer better protection to their new master. Ragar boldly walks the long pathway to the throne’s steps. His newly raised soldiers escort him.\n\nKing Osborne solemnly sits on the throne. The golden crown sitting on his wavy brown hair suddenly feels a lot heavier. Beside him sits the queen and his daughter, Catherine.\n\n“Has your quest for power satisfied you, Ragar?” the King projects into the merely empty throne room. His words give a slight echo, a result of the room\u0027s emptiness.\n\nI WILL NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL YOU’RE DEAD\n\n“I will not be satisfied until you’re dead,” Ragar answers.\n\nThe Queen rises from her seat in anger. “Ragar! Enough of this! You have betrayed your family, your own flesh and blood. If I had known what you would grow up to be, I would have ended your life in childbirth.”\n\nRagar utters a contemptuous laugh. “No, you would not. The true evil sits beside you. None of you have the strength to grasp the power our blood offers, even more so with the ritual I’ve discovered; the same one you banished me for.”\n\nKing Osborne interjects. “You gave me no choice, son. You’re lucky to have received banishment and not execution.”\n\n“Enough of this. Now you die,” Ragar spits.\n\nWith a wave of his hand, the undead escort charges the throne’s steps. Osborne grips his two-handed hammer in anticipation. Holy magic fires from the Queen’s open palm. The blast burns right through the undead soldiers. The remaining few receive fatal blows from the King’s mighty hammer.\n\nRagar expected the outcome. The undead soldiers provided him with enough time to finish casting the spell. The throne room fills with banshee screams. The royal family is forced to cover their ears. An invisible grip pulls the Queen towards Ragar. The grip begins to compress, the Queen cries out in pain. Ragar laughs as the Queen’s bones snap under the magical compression. At the top of the throne\u0027s steps, Catherine screams. As the Queen\u0027s body drops lifelessly to the floor, Ragar turns to the other members of the royal family.\n\n“And to think, your, our, divine blood couldn’t save her...”\n\nIT WON’T SAVE YOU EITHER\n\n“...It won’t save you either.”\n\nKing Osborne charges down the steps with his hammer raised overhead. His sudden assault catches Ragar off guard; he is barely able to raise a defensive shield to absorb the blow. The powerful strike sends Ragar flying across the floor. Holy sigils on the hammer emit a golden glow. The divine power of the artifact surges through Osborne, and his eyes emit the same glow.\n\nThe power inside Ragar, the one he devoted his soul to, wills him to roll to his left. The hammer crushes through the floor in the place Ragar just was. Snarling as if a rabid dog, he springs to his feet. Ragar fires several shadow bolts towards Osborne. The King is able to defend against each one.\n\nSuddenly a blade pierces out the front of Osborne’s throat in a burst of red. The King drops clutching his wound. The undead Queen stands over the body of her fallen husband. Shadowy wisps begin to form in her eye and mouth holes. Ragar smiles at his mother. The seed of black magic he planted have begun to grow. The igniting agent: her death. His eyes draw to young Princess Catherine.\n\nWE MUST PRESERVE THE DIVINE BLOODLINE\n\nRagar hesitates a moment, and then surrenders his will to the dark power within.\n\n“We must preserve the divine bloodline.”\n",

Don’t think for a second that I trust you, Lorthander,” you say.\n\nA slow chuckle emanates from underneath the hood. As you wish.\n\nThe threat neutralized, if you could call it that, you immediately check on Seth. His fall wasn’t as graceful as yours. Both of his legs appear broken, judging by the size of the boulder on them. Seth’s eyes are closed, but at least his chest rises and falls with breath. He’s alive, though in bad shape. Your hands grip underneath the boulder and using the strength of your legs, you manage to roll it from Seth’s legs.\n\n“Sorry, kid.

Seth immediately throws one of his swords at the shaman, which harmlessly flies through Lorthander and bounces off the wall behind him.\n\nIt’s unwise to attack your healer.\n\n“Keep your sorcery away. I can manage on my own,” Seth says.\n\nWe don’t have the luxury of time. Our leader needs you, all of you.\n\nYou look up to see members of the company staring down through hole in the floor where Seth and you fell. The spell that affected their mind is gone, and they watch you with interest. Lorthander brings his staff to Seth’s legs. Green wisps swirl around the gnarled staff, lingering for a moment, and then they project into Seth’s legs, repairing and strengthening bone and muscle. Seth bends his knees, testing the strength and then rises, still kicking his feet.\n\n“What have you gotten ourselves into, kid?” Seth asks. \"This is the same being that allied himself with the Empire and helped slaughter our friends.\"\n\n“Only what is necessary. While I mourn for our friends, everything has led up to this moment. I will use all available tools to defeat the Empire, even one made from its own hand.”\n\nYou regroup with the rest of the company. Lorthander heals each man who sustained injury in the mental attack. They have the same mindset as you; the Empire must be stopped by any means necessary. For the first time in the war, the tide is turning in your favor. With the power of the Unbroken, you will topple an empire.\n",
  "page 191": "“You, Lorthander, created the Unbroken?” you ask as you come back to reality.\n\nRagar was the first, but he is not the last. I know you hear the voice. I can sense the power within you.\n\n“What do you know of the voice?”\n\nIt’s a side effect of the ritual. The blood of the hellspawn wants to control the host. It wants to feed, and left unchecked, it will consume the host in a neverending blood rage. Some urges are stronger than others. I’m sure by your age you know that by now.\n\n“If you created it, perhaps you can cure it,” you say.\n\nThere is no cure. It’s in your very blood. The blood of the hellspawn mixed with Osborne’s ‘divine’ lineage, always at odds within, coaxing the host to draw on its power.\n\nThe dark figure, the shaman, Lorthander, releases you from suspension in the air. Your feet hit the ground with relief.\n\n“I’m not some young prince to be misguided. It’s clear you want something from me, otherwise you would have attacked me same as the others,” you say.\n\nAnother false king sits on the throne. The Emperor has spread rumors that he is Unbroken. He’s not, I can assure you of that, even if he desperately wants to be. I am bound to the throne. I am bound to you, the true ruler.\n\n“I am not royalty, and I have no desire to rule. I’m afraid your loyalty is to the wrong man.”\n\nThe best leaders are those who do not strive for power. They have nothing to prove. They only do as they must.\n\n“I know what you’re asking, Lorthander. I’ve been fighting the Empire my entire life. If I could simply stride into the Emperor’s throne room and slay him, I would.”\n\nYou can now, with my aid. Together, we will overthrow the Emperor. I will teach you to control the power, to control the voice. If left unchecked, it will consume you.\n",
  "page 193": "“No. I’ve spent my entire life battling the urges from the voice. I will not give in to its power.”\n\nI urge you to reconsider.\n\n“I’ve survived this long on my training alone. The darkness within me must be suppressed, not unleashed,” you adamantly state.\n\nSo be it. I’ll be needing your blood then.\n\nOnce again, the unseen power pulls you into the air. You try to fight, squirm, but you’re held captive, unable to fight, conventionally, the opponent before you. Weapons in the armory begin to shift, floating on their own, gathering in the air. Swords, battleaxes, and spears rearranged themselves into a makeshift, jagged cage against the wall. Your body flies into the center, upside-down. The cage door squeals shut with the groan of metal bending.\n\nIn the cage, upside-down, a sword point pricks your skin, creating a continuous flow of blood to the ground. You look down to see a ceremonial bowl placed underneath the cage collecting your blood. Unable to move, unable to break free, your death comes, slowly, drop by drop.\n",
  "page 196": "My strength grows. Not only the power within, the one Lorthander created, but our military might grows as well. I’ve never witnessed anything like it, the closest would be the holy sigils inscribed on some of the monks’ weapons. It’s like the feeling of running and never getting tired. There’s a point when you sprint towards a target when you reach your quickest speed. It does not last long as exhaustion takes over. The energy pool I rely on is inexhaustible. The monks taught me to move with frightening speed, to have instinct and reaction times far greater than the average man. Now when I think on their abilities, they were truly the average ones.\n\nI do not allow it to consume me, though. I’m well aware of the shadow nature within. If left alone, it will be like a spreading wildfire, burning everything in its path. No, I temper it will discipline. My power may be growing, but I control it. It does not control me. It iss the same thing every man experiences, the battle within between good and evil. It’s just amplified within me...and the consequences are much greater.\n\nI have asked myself if I’m trading one evil for another, if I am becoming the embodiment of everything I oppose. Such thoughts are detrimental. I cannot burden myself with questioning each action. I can only act in accordance with what I believe to be the right action. Still, I keep a healthy level of introspection, but similarly to the power, I do not let it consume me. Each attribute is but a tool at my disposal. I use it when it is necessary, but never allow the tool to become me. I am the master of my fate.\n",
  "page 195": "The pitiful defense of the Imperial soldier is no match for you. Your sword tears through the white and gold armor, dying it in a burst of red. You become a blur, moving through the battlefield as a typhoon, wreaking havoc in your wake. The Empire commander orders his men towards you, normally a sound tactic to surround the enemy’s leader, but all he does is bring more men for you to slaughter. Those that try to run from your sword receive a shadowy blast through their chestplate.\n\nFrom behind your ranks, Lorthander weaves his psionic magic, causing turmoil and fear within the Empire soldiers. You signal your officers to charge forward, each one a member of the company. It’s taken years, but more have rallied to your side. The members of the company each lead a battalion, all under your ultimate command. Your military force grows along with support from the people. A child of tragedy growing up to oppose the same Empire that massacred his peaceful adoptive family? The people ate it up. It’s the type story that would be etched into history, especially if victory was achieved.\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but after Narrow’s Edge fell, a direct route into the Empire was created, allowing you to travel in and out of the territory quickly. You are still vastly outnumbered, but the quality of your soldiers are equally overshadowing of the Empire’s. You recruit and train real warriors, rather than conscripting farmers and laborers. A smaller force requires you to prioritize mobility and to strike hard, fast, never fighting the beast head on.\n\nThe capital city lies in the distance. Today, you will burn it to the ground.\n",
  "page 110": "The two soldiers stationed outside of the throne room offer little resistance. In a fair fight perhaps they would, but the unsuspecting soldiers didn’t stand a chance. You swing open the double-doors, expecting to be met by more soldiers. Instead, only a handful remain. A man, King Aeric, sits on the throne watching you enter. Silent, you walk forward, Captain Wren and the others at your back.\n\n“You insult me wearing that armor,” King Aeric yells. His voice echoes in the large, empty room.\n\nYou remove the masked helm. “No disrespect, it’s simply out of necessity.”\n\nKing Aeric motions to the man at his side dressed in the same dark red that you remember Seth wearing. “Mordecai, is this him?”\n\nThe man pulls a strand of dark hair from his face. “Yes, my king.”\n\n“Strange. You’re the last person I expected to side with the Emperor. Many years ago, I heard tales of your success fighting the Imperial army. And now look at you, the famed warrior is but an attack dog for the Emperor,” King Aeric directs towards you.\n\n“Things are never as they seem. Like, for example, the protection you supposedly provided the monastery. Your military strength came from the very place you failed to protect. That’s why you’re here. Your four-decade failure has finally caught up to you,” you answer.\n\n“Ha-ha! You really have been brainwashed by the Empire’s propaganda. There is nothing that could have been done that day.”\n\n“Armies of that size don’t travel unnoticed. I’m certain you had reports of their activity well in advance of the attack. And what did you do? Hide in your castle. There’s no where else to hide, false king. You’ve been exposed for the coward you are.\n\nKing Aeric, visibly angered by your insult rises from his throne and spits on the ground in your direction. “I’ll not be spoken to like that in my own throne room. You speak of cowardice, and yet you raise your sword against an old man. That, is true cowardice.”\n\n“Shall I put the dog down, my king?” Mordecai asks.\n\nKing Aeric fixes his gaze on you. “Put him down.”\n",
  "page 198": "You cut your way through to the Imperial commander. Off in the distance, you see Horne masterfully backstabbing fleeing Empire troops. His talent for blending in extends to the battlefield, using the chaotic setting to catch his enemy unaware. The commander stands between two fully-plated knights with kiteshields. The commander’s thick mustache covers his top lip, but even then, you can see the tremble underneath.\n\n“Stop!” he shouts. “Lay down your arms and you will be given a merciful death.”\n\nThe two knights beside him point their spears in your direction for emphasis. You eye them for a moment, then wave your hand. Dark missiles fire from your open palm, bursting through the heavily plated knights. They crumple to the ground with a clash of metal brought on by their armor. Their spears roll harmlessly on the ground away from their limp hands.\n\n“The Emperor will deal with you. It’s my honor to die in his service,” the Commander says, charging forward.\n\nYou wait until he’s almost upon you. The commander’s sword is arced back, ready to strike the killing blow for his leader. You stand, unmoving, at the threat in front of you, so long that the commander actually believes his blade will strike true. At the last moment, you spin to your right and swipe your sword out in the his path. His charge takes him full force into your sword, separating his upper half from lower.\n\n“Your taste for the theatrical is most amusing,” the muffled voice of Horne speaks.\n\n“An enemy with nothing to lose is more dangerous than an overconfident one,” you say wiping the blood from your sword.\n\n“I have a hard time believe either pose a danger to you,” he answers.\n\n“I have a realistic understanding of my abilities,” you answer. “Though I’m not prideful or short-sighted enough to believe I cannot be beaten. No man is untouchable, not me, not the Emperor.”\n\n“Speaking of which,” Horne says. “The capital is ours for the taking.”\n\n“Rally the men. We march forward.”\n\nThe capital is built in a circular manner. The main keep lies in the center, surrounded by varying sections of the city. Besides the city walls, the residential and merchant portions of the city aren’t defendable. The keep is where the true defense lies. Tightly packed buildings, built more vertical than horizontal, fill the city. As the city grew, it looks like the only option was to build up rather than out. There’s only so much space within the city walls, even for a city as massive as the capital.\n\nAs you enter the city walls, alarm bells ring throughout the city. You don’t see many civilians; the shut doors and closed shutters alert you to their location. It seems the news of your arrival traveled quicker than expected, although it’s likely the people boarded up as the Empire’s main force went to meet Seth.\n\nSeveral groups of the city’s watch attempt to stop you, but they give less of a fight than the Imperial soldiers. There is little resistance up until the keep. The main gate into the fortress is shut, and you can see lines of soldiers standing at the ready within the courtyard. Archers stand overlooking the fortress’ walls, firing down on your force as you draw close. You order your men to scatter into nearby streets to avoid being freely fired upon.\n\nLeave them to me.\n\nLorthander raises his staff into the air and shouts incoherent words. Magic pulses into the air in a ripple, as if a stone dropped into a body of water. The ripples extend from the staff and pulse through the archers. The heavy rain of arrows stop for a moment, and then you hear cries from the keep walls. You see some of the archers lifelessly fall from the top, leaving behind red stains and protruding bone on the ground below. The top of the keep becomes a chaotic mess of infighting. Imperial soldiers fire on their own and take up arms against one another, similarly to your first steps inside the crumbling ruins Lorthander resided in.\n\nNo longer exposed to arrow fire, you charge the front gate. Simultaneously, you and Lorthander blast the gate with magic. The mix of shadow bolt and psionic wave shatter the metallic gate. With a screech of metal, the gate implodes, unable to bear its weight in the weakened condition. White and gold armored soldiers stand at the ready, but don’t meet your attack. They assume a defensive position, waiting for you to enter.\n\nKILL THEM ALL\n\n“Ki--\" you begin to command before resisting the voice. You feel it build within you. It wants to be released. It coaxes, wanting to let you rest and take control for awhile. And why shouldn’t you? You’ve fought hard enough up until this point. Why not allow it to finish things?\n",
  "page 197": "“Are you sure dividing our force is the best option?” you ask, feeling your chin in thought.\n\n“Our growth in the past few years allows us to,” Seth answers, both hands placed firmly on the table in front of him. He adds on, pointing to the map. “I’ll lead the prime army into Urchin’s Hook, posing as a direct attack on the capital. The Empire will have to send a sizable number to meet us or they will risk surrendering the capital, a defeat even the Empire cannot recover from.”\n\n“That’s a lot of men in the open,” you comment.\n\n“Exactly! When they march on our position, we’ll retreat into Yen’s Passage. The narrow road through the hills will force the Empire to lose their numbers advantage. In the meantime, you will take a battalion and lead a firestrike on the capital. They’ll be caught defenseless...well, as defenseless as possible.”\n\n“It could work,” you say. “What do you think, Lorthander?”\n\nIt’s a sound plan. I will aid the attack on the capital.\n\n“I would also like to be in the firestrike,” Horne says, the cloak covering his lower face muffles his voice.\n\nYou look around the room at your advisors and trusted commanders. They’ve stood by you faithfully, helping you win countless battles against the Empire. After more than thirty years, you will finally have justice for the monastery massacre. You weigh the risk in your head, taking account for every outcome as well as judging the Empire’s strength against your own.\n\n“Very well,” you say. “In five day’s time, we bring the Empire to its knees. Seth, don’t take unnecessary risk. Fall back and preserve the prime army if things turn south. They’ll likely have wyverns, but their aerial assault counts for nothing in the tight passageway.”\n\n“I thought of that too,” Seth answers.\n\nYour eyes draw back to the map and the wooden figurines representing both your army and the Empire’s. You symbolically knock the Empire’s to the ground.\n",
  "page 178": "“There’s where they camp. It’s not too far from the road, but they’re a lot closer than I’d like them to be,” Richard says holding a branch down for you to see. You count maybe twenty tents set up in a circle. White and gold armored sentries patrol the outskirts around the structures.\n\n“There’s not that many of them. I say we sneak within their ranks after dark,” Seth says.\n\n“Are you that quick to return to bed? There’s too many for just us three, even with a surprise attack,” Richard answers.\n\n“You’ve never seen the kid in action,” Seth replies. “I’m telling you, we can manage this.”\n\nYou observe through the makeshift woodland window. Twenty tents, probably more than three times that in head count. It doesn’t feel like the best way to mount an offensive strike. You can tell Seth is eager to strike -- he wants revenge for his men, but there must be a better approach. If they somehow separate their number, your chances of success significantly increase.\n\n“We’re better off if they divide their force. Even if they’re just split into two groups, our chance at success doubles,” you say.\n\n“I know these woods better than anyone. I’ll draw as many as I can from the camp. You two play clean up. Sound good?” Richard says.\n\nYou and Seth nod.\n\n“Good. I suggest you rest up before night. You’ll need all of your strength, especially you, Seth. Those wounds have barely healed.”\n\n“I’ll be fine. Don’t get yourself killed. I’d hate to obligate myself to that pretty wife of yours, Seth answers.\n\n“Heh. Sarah’d likely finish the job these Imperial soldiers failed to do if you tried.”\n\nYou kneel in the dirt, taking in your surroundings. You breathe in the fresh forest air and visualize the upcoming battle. It will be dark. You will use the cover of night to strike hard, quick, not spending too much time in one area. Likewise, it will be harder to see reinforcements coming. Still, there will be much confusion in their ranks. You imagine your technique, your practice. You’ve flowed through the forms countless times physically and mentally. The upcoming battle will require acute focus from both aspects of your training.\n",

  "page 179": "It’s time. The sun has recently set, and a layer of clouds dampen the moon’s brightness. The conditions couldn’t be more perfect besides possibly a fog. Richard scurries off, bow in hand, to travel to the opposite side of the camp. You didn’t exactly know what the signal would be, but he said “you’ll know it when you see it.”\n\nMinutes pass. You watch the steady, clockwork sentries walk back and forth. Their steps seem timed like they are calculating each step with the second. Typical Empire, sacrificing the mind of the soldier for their rigid structure. They’re nothing more than dogs learning a few tricks.\n\n“It’s almost time. Get ready, kid,” Seth whispers, his two blades at each hand.\n\nYou rise from your kneeling position and slide your sword from your scabbard. It’s familiar hilt fits in the palm of your hand better than any glove could. It’s an extension of your own physical body. You feel its weight and guide it through the air with ease as if your own arm.\n\nThen, time slows down. The corner of your vision fades in like a collapsing tunnel. Darkness overtakes, save for a single point of vision. Seth’s face melts away, the skin loosely falling from his face. His eyes turn into two running waterfalls down his exposed cheekbones. His teeth grind together, screeching, sending shivers down your neck. The pressure between his top and bottom teeth increases, sending chips of tooth flying in the air.\n\nHA HA HA HA HA\n\nThe laughing subsides within your mind, allowing your vision to come back. Seth’s hand waves in front of you searching for some sign of life.\n\n“You ok? You went dark there for a second. It’s normal to be nervous. I am, too, if I’m being honest, but we’re better than them. They’re no more than farmers conscripted and dressed up all pretty. I’d be surprised if their captain even has half the training we have.”\n\n“I’m fine,” you say shaking the image of Seth’s skull from your mind. “I’m focused on the task at hand.”\n\n“That’s my boy. I think it’s time. Look.”\n\nTwo small fiery comets shoot across the sky and land in the encampment. From wherever Richard is hiding, his flame arrows land true. The fire instantly expands on the canvas and spreads to nearby tents. Men begin to shout and you see multiple bodies rushing from their tents to find some way to extinguish the spreading flame.\n\nThen, you see three, four bodies drop. The arrows lodged in their fallen bodies are like flags claiming territory. Soon, the Imperial soldiers identify the direction in which the ranged attack is coming from and start to mobilize that way.\n\nNot waiting for Seth’s command, you half-run, half-walk in a crouch towards the camp. Your steps are silent, not that the Imperial soldiers would hear you over the commotion. Your blade eats into an unsuspecting soldier, sliding in and out before he can react. The body drops quickly, unmoving, as you search for your next victim.\n\nYour mind draws back to your childhood, the day of the massacre. You were powerless to stop the attack, even with yours and Kassi’s offensive. You dropped many soldiers that day. Now that you’re of age, many more will fall this night. Then, you were limited by childhood. Even with your extensive training, a prolonged battle against adult strength would eventually be futile. Your hand grips tighter around your hilt. You’re no longer limited, burdened by lack of years. You feel strong, powerful, the Imperial soldiers before you might as well be children. You strike them down easily as if they were.\n",

There must be more, a deeper meaning behind my life.\n\nI told myself they were evil. I’m sure they said the same thing about me. As I grow older, I’m understanding there are few absolutes. Almost nothing is ever certain. Truth is relative for each individual, even in false beliefs. I searched for a deeper meaning behind life. We were successful in our attacks against the Empire.

With a short grunt, he attacks, pushing you off balance with the tower shield, and following up, quickly, with a swipe of his battle axe. You block the axe, but not how you would have liked due to the shield bash.

His battle axe swings towards your head, but you’re already just out of range. Immediately, you test his defenses, lunging forward and picking a high to low series of strikes. One of the strikes pierces his defense staggering him down to a knee. In his vulnerable state, you kick the shield from his grasp, from using it as a crutch to remain standing.

  "page 180": "Captain Wren’s lips kiss down her neck to meet the warmth below. His callused hand grips a breast as his mouth meets her firm nipple. She moans, softly, an inescapable sound that only excites Wren even more. His hand grabs harder, massaging quicker and with more passion. She wants him, he knows it. He could have had her either way, but this is better. Effort from both parties: that’s the way he likes it. His hand moves between her legs and finds it wet, ready, waiting for him to enter. All in good time. He is just getting started.\n\n“Fire! Captain! We’re under attack!”\n\nThe shout rings through his canvas tent like a bucket of cold water. A hulking, tanned man enters through the tent flaps. Captain Wren sighs knowing full-well he’s needed elsewhere. Rexxus wouldn’t barge in otherwise.\n\n“Counter-attack, Captain. Sorry for the intrusion.”\n\n“Not needed, Rexx. Mira here is simply helping me sleep.”\n\nAt her mention, Mira pulls a blanket over her exposed breasts. She notices Rexx looking down and realizes the blankets didn’t cover everything and quickly corrects the action lower down. Rexxus coughs, showing a little more embarrassment than she would have thought from an Imperial soldier. Maybe it’s due to the fact he was caught looking.\n\n“If you’re going to interrupt me, don’t just stand there. What’s going on?” Captain Wren speaks, throwing on his light set of armor.\n\n“Archers from the west. A small group judging by the amount of arrows fired. Some of the initial shots were flame-tipped,” Rexx answers turning back to business.\n\n“Any others?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Not yet, you mean. There are always others.”\n",
  "page 183": "“Well done, kid. Glad you’re on our side.”\n\nYou turn to see Seth holding a bloodied man by his brown wavy hair. By the man’s armor, you assume, rightly, he’s he one in charge. While the man looks distressed, he’s not in panic, unlike most would be in his position. He must be in charge.\n\n“I thought we’d have a little chat with our friend… Wren was it?” Seth says, twisting the man’s face up to meet his. The man, Wren, does his best to nod. A figure emerges from the dark, Richard, leading a woman bound at the hands by rope.\n\n“Caught her trying to escape. She looks harmless, but we don’t need her telling another Imperial battalion we’re here,” he says.\n\n“The more the merrier,” Seth answers, shoving Wren into a nearby tent. You, Richard, and the woman follow closely behind. Seth straps Wren to a chair in the center of the tent, hands behind the backrest. Richard stands near the tent entrance holding the bound woman as if a parent watching a child’s leashed pet.\n\n“Let’s get started, shall we? How did you know we were coming? How did you know to ambush us?” Seth asks.\n\nCaptain Wren spits blood from his mouth to the ground beside him. “We have an...unconventional informant.”\n\nSeth’s right fist meets the Captain’s jaw. The woman screams, revealing the fact that she knows Wren.\n\n“Mira, don’t worry. They won’t hurt you. I promise,” the Captain speaks, eating another fist from Seth for not answering his questions. “Alright, alright. I’ll tell you. I know how these things go. There’s a shaman, a man that speaks to spirits. He approached me, giving knowledge to an upcoming assault. I thought he was just a crazy old man, but sent a force on the off-chance he was correct. There’s something...strange about him. Something powerful, mysterious, like you want to find out what it is, but then again, you don’t.”\n\n“You’re saying a shaman gave you battle plans? I thought you Imperials were more distrusting than that.”\n\n“I’ve served under bad leadership, leadership that doesn’t listen or take advice from others. I promised myself I would be different.”\n\n“Where is this shaman?”\n\n“I don’t know. He appears in a mist of black smoke with gnarled staff at his side. He leans on it, always, because his back is crunched like he’s caring a heavy burden. A dark hood covers his face. His voice is otherworldly, it’s like a projection from behind the veil.”\n\n“Well, this has got us nowhere,” Seth answers.\n\nSuddenly, your vision tunnels again. The black edges focus on a single target. Mira. You’re unable to speak. It’s like an animalistic instinct taking over, compelling you to move, to act in survival. You hardly notice Seth drawing his dagger against Captain Wren’s throat. A voice inside your mind speaks, echoing, resounding within your core, fading in and out, loud and quiet.\n\nMAKE HER SUFFER AS WE HAVE SUFFERED\n\nRichard notices your strange advance, and holds a hand out. “Whoh, now. Are you ok?”\n\nYou push past him, and slide your sword into Mira’s chest. A soft laugh, more of a slow chuckle, escapes through the thin gap between your lips. Richard drops to a knee to catch the falling woman’s body. Seth whirls around to see the commotion.\n\n“What the fu--\" he starts to say before seeing Mira’s blood dripping from the point of your sword.\n\nControl is back.\n\n“I...uh. I don’t know what happened,” you say, looking down.\n\nRichard and Seth exchange looks, unsure how to handle the situation. Seth walks to you and places a hand on your shoulder, comfortingly.\n\n“It’s alright. If we let her go, the Empire would spare no expense to find us. It’s better this way,” Seth says, sending another look to Richard.\n\nVisibly unhappy, Richard drops the leash end of the rope, no longer needing to hold Mira captive. Giving your shoulder one last reassuring squeeze, Seth exits the tent along with Richard. The image of Seth’s melting face comes back to your mind.\n",

  "page 185": "There is a darkness within me. I feel it, growing, wanting to consume me completely. My training is what I rely on to combat it. Each day I rise before the sun, disciplining my body and mind for the upcoming battle. I’ve come to realize there are little certainties; the battle is the only exception. I must be at my sharpest each day. I know it will come. It wants full control, and sometimes it wins. My defeat only spurs me to greater heights. I learn, recognizing its tricks in order to stave them off next time.\n\nMira’s death was the first time I experienced complete, and utter, defeat. It was like watching the experience out of my own body, unable to act, unable to cry out. I’m not prideful enough to say it doesn’t scare me. After all, who wouldn’t be frightened by an unknown power, an unknown force potent enough to take over oneself completely? I study my actions, along with the times the voice appears. There must be a pattern, there must be a winning strategy. There always is.\n\nI wonder what happened to Kassi after I left with Seth. Often I think about her. She was my only friend, along with Brother Samuel though he was more in the mentor, father role. Did I leave her to die? No, she had the same choice presented in front of her. She could have escaped along with me. If she met her end that day, it was her decision, not mine. I wonder if anyone escaped that day. Death was inevitable if we stayed. The Empire doesn’t take unnecessary risks like leaving highly trained warriors alive. Part of me feels bad for leaving Kass, but I cannot think that way. We each act to the best of our ability, and the outcome is no one’s fault, really. It’s just the way things are.\n",
  "page 184": "It finally happened. It was only a matter of time. King Aeric’s castle was finally taken by the Emperor. The rumors speak of a squadron of wyverns leading the assault. Wyverns! They were supposed to be extinct. The Empire is a great beast and nothing is out of her reach. Seth was right. If you had stayed in the castle, you would be dead along with King Aeric and his men. Not that you had a choice in the matter -- Aeric had banished you, after all.\n\nYou find yourself at a crossroad. You’ve won countless small battles against the Empire. Each time, another Imperial command replaces the one before. The resources you oppose are seemingly endless. Yours, on the other hand, is dwindling. Richard left years ago, returning back to his village. The act didn’t surprise you. He had only helped to drive the Imperial soldiers from wandering too near to his family. You’ve become a small band of freedom fighters, outcasts, renegades, wanderers with no place to call home, led by Seth.\n\nYou’re close to discovering the location of the shaman. The first real lead in months checked. What would originally be considered tribal superstition, fits Captain Wren’s description of the shaman. By chance, one of the Imperial transports you set upon were carrying prisoners, tribal members from the Yssar Plain. Their stories tell of a crumbling castle, haunted by an evil spirit. One of their tribe supposedly saw the dark spirit, cloaked in black, commanding the elements, before sprinting back to the tribe, but not before abandoning the buck he had hunted. The tribe ridiculed the man, stripping him of his honor for running in fear.\n\nThe crumbling castle as your destination, with your band of freedom fighters, you head to confront the shaman and strike a deadly blow to the Empire.\n",
  "page 187": "“We should be close now,” Seth comments from the head of the group. You travel single file through the forest, guided by directions from the tribal member. There are twenty of you (give or take), dressed in varying colors from previous allegiances. The company of freedom fighters doesn’t have the well-coordinated march or attire of Imperial soldiers, save for the few that defected, but when it comes to battle coordination, there are few that can stand with you. It’s not hours of drilling that guides you, it’s battle-hardened soldiers with the instinct for war. Those that joined the company lacking the instinct didn’t stay long. Anyone who wanted to oppose the Empire could join, only ones with an aptitude for combat stayed.\n\nFrom behind a tree, a man steps out, silent and stern. The cloak at his back rises high, covering the lower half of his face. “It’s just through here. The forest opens to clearing. The ruins are there. No sign of activity.”\n\n“Good work, Horne. Keep an eye on the perimeter. I’d like some sort of warning if others will be joining us,” Seth answers.\n\nThe man, Horne, bows his head slightly and disappears back in to the forest. Even with your years of training, you barely hear his footsteps. Horne’s ability to melt into his surroundings are almost supernatural, a ghost silently watching from the outside.\n\n“What do you think we’ll encounter in there?” one of the men behind you speaks, though not too loudly.\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” you answer. “Our task remains the same. This shaman has proved a valuable asset to the Empire. Striking him down will be a significant blow to the beast.”\n\n“Do you think the castle is really haunted?” another asks.\n\nBefore you can answer, another man chimes in. “It’s just tribal nonsense. They pray to the earth and worship the sun. I bet the ‘demon’ is nothing more than a rogue sorcerer taking refuge in the ruins.”\n\n“Even if that is the case, taking down a caster is no easy task, especially in his home. Who knows what magical traps and surprises lie in wait,” you say.\n\n“No easy task? What would you call that business in Leifhelm then? Or the Imperial mage in Felgrown Keep? And the conjurer in Vern?--\"\n\nYou cut off the man before he can continue. “Past success doesn’t promise future victories. In each of those cases, it may have been my blade finishing the task, but every man here played their part. Keep your blade sharp…”\n\n“…and your mind sharper,” the company echoes.\n\n“Leadership suits you,” Seth whispers, too soft for the others to hear. “You would have made a fine commander in the king’s army.”\n\n“No use in thinking about that now. Look, there are the ruins,” you whisper back, eyeing the crumbling stone and scattered rocks in the overgrown grass. The archway, where a gate once sat, lies open, inviting you in, promising safe shelter.\n\nHE’S HERE\n\nThe voice appears in your mind. You shake it off, using your breath to focus on the present moment rather than the internal whispers. The demon awaits.\n",
  "page 186": "Ekk’a crept silently forward, his sun-weathered hand tightly around his crude bow. The hunt had taken him far away from the tribe, too far, but the buck would be his. He would return to his people with enough meat to eat for several days. It was his duty to provide for his people. His light barefoot steps don’t snap twigs or rustle fallen leaves. They’re quiet, born of a lifetime of practice. At the age of ten, it was the tribe’s tradition to send a boy coming into manhood into the wilderness, alone, with only a week’s worth of supplies. They could return in a month, any attempt to return earlier would be met with shame on the entire family. The tribe had no place for weak men.\n\nEkk’a\u0027s thoughts always return to his rite of passage, even now, almost twenty years later. He spent most nights shivering in the cold, unable to start a fire due to the attention it brought. Several boys were sent out at the same time, and it wasn’t uncommon for infighting to occur. After all, a knife to the back is easier than tracking your own hunt. The thought brought a slight smile to his lips. Some of the others took the easy approach. Ekk’a didn’t, relying on his prowess as a hunter to survive. He was strong, born of a family of warriors. Taking the easy approach would be dishonorable to their tradition.\n\nThrough two tree trunks, Ekk’a spotted his prey. The buck is young, although still much larger than the average doe. Its antlers rise from its head like branches of a stream. The buck’s head lifted for a moment, sensing the air. Too late. Ekka’s arrow fired true, landing squarely in the buck’s neck. One arrow was not enough to drop it, and it took off into the forest, a cursing Ekk’a following.\n\nThe trail of blood and broken branches led to the outskirts of the demon. Ekk’a knew he was getting close, but his buck would soon drop. The amount of blood loss clearly showed he would find it collapsed, breathing its final moments. If he had the Earth Mother’s blessing, it would find it soon.\n\nThen he saw it. The demon’s ruins. A crumbling castle, overgrown with grass. Large stone blocks scattered in the surrounding field. The front gate is simply an open arch; the actual gate has long fallen from its place. It’s inviting, welcoming in newcomers to walk into the deteriorating walls. Ekk’a spotted the fallen buck not 30 feet past the arch. Notching an arrow at the ready, Ekk’a stepped through.\n\nThe breeze whispered to Ekk’a. Soft voices, more of a lightless murmur, carried on the wind. His footsteps took him from the warmth of the sunlight into the chilling shade of the open archway. Despite the chill, Ekk’a felt a bead of sweat run down the side of his face. Still holding the bow ready, he wiped the sweat with the back of his forearm. He was almost there. His hunt would be complete.\n\nJust when he arrived at the fallen animal, a flock of crows fly out from a nearby gap in the castle, filling the air with squawking and flapping of wings. Ekk’a instantly ducked, and fired an arrow, dropping one of the birds. Ekk’a suddenly felt another’s presence. Mimicking the buck, his head lifts, searching for a sight or sound from another. His eyes found a gnarled staff, propping up the hunched body of a shadowy figure. The figure’s dark hood is open, and yet Ekk’a can’t see the face underneath. It’s black like a cloudy night blocking the stars and moon.\n\nIt seems we have a visitor.\n\nThe demon’s voice projected from behind the veil. It’s the mix between a low growl and raspy, labored breath. Each word is articulated to perfection, slow and deliberate. Ekk’a fired another arrow at the demon. To his disbelief, the arrow flies harmlessly through the figure and bounces from the opposite castle wall.\n\nYou are not him. Bring him to me.\n\nThe gnarled staff pointed Ekka’s way, burning a symbol on his forehead. Ekk’a didn’t know who “he” was, but he abandoned all thoughts of what was honorable or not. Ekk’a ran, retracing the trail of blood, the mark of the demon displayed for all to see.\n"
