The voice within me, the one that causes me to commit terrible deeds, burns a low ember. Still, it remains, always present, always looking for fuel to burn. It wants to escape. I feel its lust. It wants to devour. This day is no different.

While not directly affecting you, the reader\u0027s path, they may create a more cinematic feel to the story.\n\nOriginally written as the last page for Sixteen Words, I hope you enjoy my full adaptation of Contemplation."]
