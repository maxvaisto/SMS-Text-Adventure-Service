["13","Hastings, 1066: Aftermath","TheWriterInTheDark","7","3","7.27","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/Hastings,_1066_0x3a__Aftermath.aspx","In 1066 England, all is chaos. King Harold has been killed by the Norman, William, who has usurped the throne. The sky is darkened by smoke and reddened by fire. Carrion crows circle and swords clash. The fate and future of England is at stake. Blades will strike. Men will die. Blood will flow.\n    A Brief Note: I am somewhat hesitant to classify this storygame as \u0027historical\u0027. Of the fifty-two endings, only a couple bear any resemblance to actual history. Many of the people and places are real; however, many more have been fabricated. I decided very early on to sacrifice authenticity in exchange for enjoyment. Please play this game knowing that it will be full of anachronisms and other a-historical events, and please DON\u0027T use it to study for your upcoming history test. Despite its inaccuracies, I still had a lot of fun writing it and I hope that you, the reader, are equally entertained while reading it."]
