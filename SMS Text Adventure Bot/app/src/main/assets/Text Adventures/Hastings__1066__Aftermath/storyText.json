{"page 921":"The Normans come that afternoon. They do not come with men. Instead, they send a message, just as you did. Three catapults, built during the two days of inactivity, are set loose with a vengeance upon your walls.\n\n\nYou order most of your men off the ramparts, and for the better part of an hour you listen from beneath the wall as great stones are hurled into it. Every now and again a stone manages to clear the wall, arching into the keep to wreak havoc. One lands in the stable, and five horses are grievously mangled. Thunder is mercifully spared.\n\n\nAnother crashes through a window, crushing the hand of a serving girl, and a third knocks the cross of York\u0027s chapel. This last blow causes religious panic amongst some of your men, and sends the priests ballistic with rage. Every curse known to God is sent towards King William, spurred onwards by the tongues of two-dozen irate churchmen.\n\n\nThe worse offense of the catapults is that by taking most of your men off the walls it has allowed the Normans to run in and deposit their scaling ladders below your walls. One of your archers runs up the ramparts and begins shooting at the Normans below, but a stray missile nearly knocks him off the wall and you order him to stand down.\n\n\nThe thud of the missiles becomes almost rhythmic, and you feel yourself begin to drift off. Catheryn shakes you awake. Her head is cocked to one side\n\n\n\"Aethel, I hear something.\"\n\n\nYou hear it too; the sound of footsteps. Many, many footsteps. You leap up\n\n\n\"To the walls! To the walls!\"\n\n\nUnder the cover of a bombardment, the Norman infantry is beginning their assault.\n","page 920":"It takes two days for the fire to burn itself out. When you rise one morning to find it gone, you are shocked by what it has left behind. The buildings are gone; their positions marked by only a few charred beams and blackened stones.\n\n\nEverywhere you look there are the bodies of those who were burned alive. Scorched bones and blackened armor. Sword blades with their hilts burnt clean off. Socketless eyes and shriveled hands, grasping hopelessly for salvation. It is an army of the dead and the damned. It is impossible to discern how many were killed. The number is in the hundreds.\n\n\nWhen the Normans attack again, it will be with a terrible vengeance. You can only hope that this has shaken William\u0027s English allies out of their stupor.\n\n\nYou stare at the blackened skeletons. Join us, or burn. Join us, or die.\n","page 923":"The English allies of the Normans have finally chosen a side. They have chosen to fight for an England led by the English. Their forces crash like a tidal wave into the rear of the regrouping Norman force. The Normans, beleaguered from the failed siege attempt, fall like wheat before a harvestman. The tide has finally turned. William\u0027s forces face defeat. You struggle to stand, but cannot support yourself without the help of Catheryn and Orvyn. You squirm angrily\n\n\n\"We need to join them! Open the gates! I must-\"\n\n\nCatheryn cuts you off\n\n\n\"My love, you\u0027re in no fit state to lead your army. You can hardly walk!\"\n\n\nYou chew your lip anxiously, watching the battle unfold below your walls. Catheryn gently lies you down on the rampart.\n\n\n\"I will lead our army.\"\n\n\nYou open your mouth, but she kisses you and you fall silent. She brushes a wayward, bloodstained length of hair away from her face\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be safe\"\n\n\nOrvyn kneels down to pat your shoulder\n\n\n\"She\u0027ll be well guarded, my lord, I won\u0027t let anything happen to her.\"\n\n\nGaryn tacitly affirms Orvyn\u0027s statement with a curt nod. Eamon, busily wrenching arrowheads free from his shield, concurs excitedly\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t worry Father! We\u0027ll all keep her safe!\"\n\n\nThey bid their farewells and then depart, hurriedly marshalling the soldiers who are still fit for battle. Using all of your strength, you manage to haul yourself up into a sitting position, one hand wrapped around a crenellation for support. All you can do is watch.\n\n\nThe gates, creaking and fire-charred groan open, and your army is unleashed from York. At their head is Catheryn, golden hair flowing. Behind her a man carries a flag with your sigil, and the English attacking the Norman rear erupt into cheers when they see it. For the Normans, your army\u0027s exodus is their deathblow. Fully encircled, the Normans begin to surrender.\n\n\nWorking alongside the Norman\u0027s erstwhile allies, your forces rout the last of the Norman resistance. With victory secured Catheryn raises her wolf\u0027s-head shield and points towards you\n\n\n\"We have won a great victory today, perhaps the greatest victory in English history, and it is all thanks to that man!\"\n\n\nAll across the battlefield there is a noise louder than the cries of the wounded, and louder still than the shrieks of the carrion crows.\n\n\nIt is the sound of your name being chanted by thousands of voices, again and again and again.\n","page 922":"The crenellations on the ramparts are like broken teeth. Many have been shattered or cracked by the bombardment, and their jagged edges leer. You crouch as low as you can, for although the bombardment has ceased, the arrow rain has begun. Your shield is soon peppered with shafts, and all along the wall your men struggle to bear the burden of the onslaught. Your own archers attempt to retaliate, but they are outnumbered and outmatched, and most of their shots go wide.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Norman infantry draws steadily closer. Beside you, Catheryn tries gingerly to remove an arrow lodged in her shield. Her face is grim, but unyielding. You pat her shoulder\n\n\n\"The stairs are on our left, if-\"\n\n\nShe shakes her head adamantly\n\n\n\"Shut up, Aethel. I\u0027m staying here.\"\n\n\nYou reach over and snap the arrow off her shield\n\n\n\"I had to ask.\"\n\n\nBelow, the Normans have reached their scaling ladders. Now, at last, your archers have a target they can easily hit. You do not envy the Normans who are struggling to hoist the ladders. They are assaulted by a barrage of arrows, slingstones, and javelins. Even stones from the shattered crenellations are thrown.\n\n\nA ladder clatters against the wall in front of you, and Normans hurriedly begin to scale it. With Orvyn and Garyn\u0027s help, you manage to heave it backwards. Normans below hurry to stabilize it, but the charred earth offers poor balance and your side emerges victorious. The ladder teeters for a moment before plummeting earthward. The climbing Normans are brought to the ground with a heavy crunch.\n\n\nThe spit of arrows rains down ever harder, volley after volley. Your ramparts are piled with dead men, bodies punctured by feathered shafts. You call out above the noise\n\n\n\"Keep those shields up! Those who have no shields, stay out of sight!\"\n\n\nOn your right, Eamon hefts his shield, which has become a pincushion of arrows. You yell over to him\n\n\n\"Eamon! You have to break them off!\"\n\n\nYou pantomime snapping the shafts, and Eamon nods in understanding. A seasoned warrior crouched beside him aids your son in removing the numerous projectiles embedded in his shield.\n\n\nAnother ladder bangs onto your section of the wall, this time more to your left. Catheryn pushes at it with her shield and you press forward with the palm of your hand and the combination of your efforts proves sufficient to dislodge the ladder. In just a few moments, the ladder is swinging back up to re-assault your position, and another on its right joins it.\n\n\nThe Normans have brought up more ladders from their rear. All along the walls of York the ladders are forming a tangle of wooden scaffolding, upon which the Normans are swarming. Soon the fight for the walls will begin.\n\n\nAs the Norman infantry begin to reach the top of the walls, the arrow hail peters off for fear of them shooting their own men from behind. Your own archers have no such fear, and they stand up to unleash bloody destruction on the climbers. The walls are a cacophony of screams as countless Norman soldiers fall to the ground, pierced by arrows or slashed by a long spear.\n\n\nStill they come, as relentless as the tide and as numerous as grains of sand. You drive your sword down the throat of a Norman scaler, Orvyn buries his axe in the head of another, and Garyn slashes at a hand trying to gain purchase on the pockmarked crenellations.\n\n\nA Norman leaps onto the wall on your left, and your wife drives her sword two-handed into his chest, shield hanging uselessly at her side. The thrust does not cut very deeply into the Norman, as most of the blow is absorbed by the chain links before they shatter, but the force is enough to shove the man backwards, and his arms pinwheel wildly as he tumbles over the edge. Catheryn crouches back, sword ready and tip red.\n\n\nThe fighting has begun in earnest. The wall has dissolved into a series of skirmishes. You all fight with the wild intensity of a cornered beast, and the Normans feel your wrath. You stand beside Cahteryn to try and keep her safe, but she seems to need to added protection. She fights with ferocity, using the few moves that you have taught her to great effect. During the fighting her helmet has been knocked loose and her golden hair, streaked red with blood, flows freely around her.\n\n\nSeveral more Normans haul themselves up over the parapet and you are forced to withdraw, nearly bumping into Orvyn. You duck a spear thrust, parry a sword blade, and knock aside an iron mace with your shield. Everyone is being forced back.\n\n\nOut of the corner of your eye you see Eamon slashing and hacking wildly, but you cannot help him because you are also battling for your life. Your trio of adversaries are working in tandem, and you cannot manage to strike back.\n\n\nYou shuffle backwards, uneasily feeling for the lip of the walkway. If you fall from the wall, you will almost certainly break your neck. You spot an opening and rush forward, ignoring a painful spear-thrust across your thigh. Using your shield as a ram you batter two of the Normans out of the way and drive your sword into the gut of the third. He exhales sharply, mouth filled with blood and bile. As he staggers back, your sword remains stuck in his torso.\n\n\nThe two Normans that you shoved aside have returned, and all you have to fight them is your shield and a dirk at your belt. The Norman with the sword advances quickly, trying to skewer you with the point of his blade. You meet him halfway with your shield, and your arm jars as the steel pierces the wood. You twist your shield to one side and rip the sword out of his hand. As he falls forward, you bury your dirk in his neck. You rip the dagger free just in time to intercept a mace blow from the third Norman. The swing, intended for your head, strikes your knife-hand instead. The force of the attack knocks the dirk free from your hand, and you cry out in pain as the bones in your fingers crack. Your hand is a horrible mess of hot and cold. Two of your fingers are definitely broken. The rest are badly sprained.\n\n\nWhen the next swing of the mace comes, you barely block it with your shield, which splinters and snaps. The iron club scrapes off the shield and cracks across your leg. You are driven to your knees. The Norman leers over you, hefting his iron mace. He lifts the weapon high-\n\n\nThen he grimaces. His head is cocked at an odd angle, and a sword blade has been driven through his neck and into his skull from behind. When the sword is withdrawn the skewered Norman collapses in a heap. In his place stands Catheryn, bloody but triumphant. Her hair is stuck with clots of gore and her outfit is speckled with blood. Her hands are cut in a number of places, and there is a long slash down one cheek, which bleeds sluggishly. Her eyes are blue fire. She has never looked so beautiful.\n\n\nShe raises her shield high, rotating it to display the black wolf sigil on the front\n\n\n\"Rally! Rally for England! Throw back the invaders!\"\n\n\nHer words are like divine inspiration, and all across the walls your soldiers take heart. Even those who are not from your household recognize the symbol of the black wolf, and cheer at its sight as though it were the holiest of relics. Your warriors find new energy, and the Normans, exhausted from climbing the walls begin to fall back.\n\n\nSlowly, slowly, the walls are cleared of Norman blue. More and more bodies pile at the foot of the wall as dead Normans are thrown over the side. You watch all of this in a daze of adrenaline. The pain is gone, but you cannot stand up.\n\n\nWhen the last of the invaders have been repulsed, Orvyn and Catheryn help you to your feet. When you look over the ramparts, you are greeted by a miracle.\n","page 925":"With William dead and his army surrendered, the Normans quickly lose control of England.

You find your soldiers lounging in the grass to the left of king Harold\u0027s men. Some laugh and cajole with each other. Some sharpen their weapons idly. Others play dice with Harold\u0027s Housecarls. One has undone his breeches and is calmly urinating in the direction of William\u0027s army. In short, of the seventy warriors under your command, not a single one looks concerned or frightened.\n\n\nThat makes you proud. Most of these men you trained since boyhood, and for many you serve as a father figure. When they stand beside you at a shieldwall you have absolute confidence in your safety. They would risk their lives to save yours, and you would do the same for any of them.\n\n\nYou only wish you could say the same for your fyrdmen. Nearly a hundred and fifty, and every single one looks terrified. You can hardly blame them. In the clash of a shieldwall, it is the fyrdmen who bear the brunt of the assault. To break a shieldwall, aiming for its weakest combatants is a common strategy. With Harold outnumbered to begin with, more fyrdmen than normal will be forced into the front ranks. The continued success of the English nation could well depend on their spirits.\n\n\nApproaching some of your men, who greet you amicably but respectfully, you instruct them to spread some of your ale reserves amongst the fyrd. Although you always fight sober, many of your men prefer to battle under the comforting haze of ale, and so long as they remain sharp enough you permit it. Some men just aren\u0027t capable of facing the sheer brutality of a shieldwall sober.\n\n\nSomeone calls your name. Turning, you see Harold waving to you from the midst of his group of Housecarls. He grins excitably, filled with the same mad energy that bubbles inside of you. His armor is expertly wrought, fine mail links that shine red under the ominous clouds. At his belt a gold-hilted sword rests in its sheath, and slung across his back is a heavy Daneaxe. His roundshield is thick and red, and is emblazoned with his personal banner; the Fighting Man. A symbol as legendary as King Harold himself, the Fighting Man depicts a golden warrior, wielding a Daneaxe and roundshield. His face is filled with the mad joy of battle, and under his watchful gaze the forces of England will stand against the Norman tide.\n\n\nMoving closer, Harold clasps your forearm with his free hand\n\n\n\"Ready?\"\n\n\nYou nod fiercely\n\n\n\"Always\"\n\n\nHe smiles, but for a moment you see a flicker of emotion cross his face. Tiredness? He opens his mouth slowly, mulling his words\n\n\n\"Once this war is over, I think I\u0027ll-\"\n\n\nOne of Harold\u0027s Housecarls interrupts the conversation\n\n\n\"My liege, the Normans are advancing!\"\n\n\nInstantly, Harold leaps back into action. Waving his shield, he calls not just to his own men, but also to all the men across the English line\n\n\n\"To arms! To arms! Form a shieldwall!\"\n\n\nThe cry of \"shieldwall\" is taken up across the line, as men rush to the front, each shield overlapping with the one to the left, forming an impenetrable wall. In theory. Calling to your men, you order them to form up beside Harold\u0027s.\n\n\nThe fight for England has begun.\n","page 928":"You shrug\n\n\n\"We still have some time.\"\n\n\nYou find a moist log and sit down.

Neither one of you is willing to speak. You grit your teeth angrily\n\n\n\"I was hoping for some encouragement. This is definitely not helping either of us.

Thunder snorts anxiously and you pat his muscled neck to calm him\n\n\n\"Ready for the ride of your life?\"\n\n\nPlacing one foot in the stirrup, you swing yourself up into the saddle. An attendant hands you your shield, and you tighten the straps that fix it to your arm. You raise your free hand\n\n\n\"Everyone ready? Good. We ride hard and fast, aiming for the Norman center! Our infantry will charge in behind us, but we\u0027ll be on our own for the first minute or so. Let\u0027s make it count!\"\n\n\nYour riders cheer, and they follow you out into the courtyard. The great gates open with a creak, and your horses are unleashed onto the cobbled streets of the lower town. Orvyn is on your left and Mance is on your right. Together, you spur your mounts at a breakneck pace down the streets. Behind you is the deafening clatter of hooves on stone as nearly a hundred horses follow your lead. Your men are in white and black, and Ryce\u0027s men are in yellow. The rest of the riders are Englishmen from a variety of associations, and they sport a variety of colors. Like a liquid mosaic, your army spills through the narrow roads.\n\n\nThunder snorts and pants, great flanks heaving. His legs fly underneath him, and Mance and Orvyn struggle to keep pace. Gradually, the buildings around you get smaller and the cobblestoned road dissolves into a dirt track. Your moment of reckoning is near. You expect to hear the buzzing of arrows, see the sky blotted with arrowshafts, but none come.\n\n\nWhen your forces burst out of the town and onto the meadow, the Norman army is still in beautiful disarray. You let out a yell of triumph and relief. Drawing your sword, you point it at the heart of the Norman maelstrom\n\n\n\"Attack! Attack! For the glory of England!\"\n\n\nYour presence has finally been identified, but it is too late now. The Norman horsemen are encircled by their own infantry, and cannot muster a counter-charge. The Norman archers are in a state of confusion, and the volley they send is wild and inaccurate. Most of the arrows go over your head, though you are forced to catch one with your shield. Behind you, there are the screams of men and horse alike as arrows find their mark. You wave your sword\n\n\n\"Spread out! Spread out!\"\n\n\nYou have taken losses, but the bulk of your force remains steady. Still, the flight of arrows has cost, and more than a dozen horses lie screeching piteously. Thunder whinnies in sympathy, head tossing anxiously. You scream over the myriad of sounds\n\n\n\"It\u0027s too late to turn back! This is it!\"\n\n\nNow it is time for the final push. Urging Thunder onward for one more spurt of energy, you drive him straight toward the Norman infantry. Trained and eager in the ways of war, Thunder obeys without hesitation. His immense weight, all bone and muscle and hoof, crashes into the Norman line with devastating effect. Shields are splintered and spears crack like matchsticks. Running out of momentum, Thunder rears and begins to kick, smashing jaws and crushing ribs. You use your long sword like a cleaver, hacking and cutting through the terrified soldiers. The rest of your horsemen are similarly entangled, and they fight with equal gusto.\n\n\nAssaulted with such ferocity, the Norman frontline buckles. But it does not break. The Normans are reforming their line, and their reserves are struggling to fill in the gaps. Surrounded, some of your lead horsemen are dragged from their saddles and butchered. Low-flying volleys of arrows pepper your depleted cavalry force, and men shriek as they are struck by feathered shafts.\n\n\nYour arm is aching from swinging your blade, but if you let the tide of Norman soldiers draw close you will be killed. Thunder bucks and rears, bowling men over with powerful hoof strikes. His flanks and legs are bleeding from numerous spear-wounds. You scream above the pandemonium\n\n\n\"Keep holding! Help will be here soon!\"\n\n\nWhen it comes, it is too little too late. The Normans have regained their momentum, and are pushing steadily forward. Your own infantry, exhausted from charging down the streets of York and up the hills of the meadow, is unable to stop the Norman advance. Your warriors surge all around you, dueling with the Norman front, but they cannot break through. Instead they are thrown back, and their bodies litter the ground before you.\n\n\nThunder shivers, aching from spent adrenaline and practically wading in the piles of dead around him. You pat his neck tiredly with the battered remains of your shield. It is the end. There is a colossal roar as the uncertain allies of the Normans finally make up their minds. They have sided with the Normans. Like jaws, they scythe into your army on its left and right. You are utterly crushed.\n\n\nAbove it all, above the screech of crows and screams of men and clash of steel you hear a voice. There in the rear of your infantry is Catheryn. Is she saying something? Is she even looking at you? You never find out.

Hopefully the ensuing firestorm will cook the fight right out of the Norman vanguard. It will also raze the outer town to ashes, but unfortunately this is the cost of war.\n\n\nYou wait patiently for the Norman army to reorganize itself. Along the wall the fires are lit under the various cauldrons of pitch, turning the black coagulate into a syrupy tar. Your archers gather around the cauldrons, stirring the mixture idly with pieces of kindling. Catheryn stands beside you, her gauntlet-clad arm slung over your shoulders\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll get through this, I know it\"\n\n\nYou nod\n\n\n\"I hope so.

At last, the Norman army is ready to march. Like the tendrils of an expanding fungus, the Norman infantry creep through the silent streets of lower York. Your archers nock their arrows, tips dripping with hot pitch. Attendants stand ready, holding burning torches. You hold up a hand\n\n\n\"Wait for the bulk of the army to enter\"\n\n\nThe Normans progress cautiously forward, clogging every street with rows and rows of men and shields and spears. The nearest of the Norman infantry is now within easy bow range, and several of your archers compulsively begin drawing their strings back\n\n\n\"Not yet!\"\n\n\nFrustrated but compliant, they back down. The Norman infantry creep ever closer, hiding in the shadows of the overhanging thatch roofs for cover. By now almost all of the army is off the meadow and into the streets of lower York. The closest of the Normans are preparing for a final burst of sprinting, and others hoist scaling ladders. Still others carry yew longbows, and many have begun fitting arrows to strings. You decide that the Norman host has drawn close enough\n\n\n\"Archers! Light your arrows!\"\n\n\nThe attendants scurry about the wall, lighting the tips of the arrows. When the fire makes contact with the black pitch it hisses, bubbles, and then flares alight. You wet your lips, watching the town below. Soon there will be only ash.\n\n\n\"Archers! Loose!\"\n\n\nThe bowstrings twang and the arrows hiss through the air, trailing sparks. The Normans all raise their shields, but the arrows are not aimed at them. They land amongst the thatch, guttering and smoking. For a few moments you wonder if the pitch was too dilute, but then the thatch begins to burn in earnest. With terrifying speed the individual pieces of thatch ignite. Some stay in place, burning bright and setting fire to the rest of the roof. Others are blown by the wind, and land on neighboring roofs. The fire spreads like a disease.\n\n\nEarlier, you had some of your men place buckets of lard and pitch amongst the eaves. As the fires on the roofs spread, these erupt and douse the Normans below with searing fat. The Normans, finally realizing the seriousness of their situation, scramble to escape.\n\n\nIn the chaos, many are knocked down and incapacitated. Others are blocked by collapsing buildings. Many of the homes have started burning on their insides, and with their supports gone they simply fall apart. The streets are filled with burning debris, and soon the screaming begins. Normans stumble about, cooking in their chainmail armor. Others flail about on the ground; their hair set fire.\n\n\nThe fires are widespread now, and many of the Normans are finding themselves encircled. They have nowhere to run as the fires close in. All that they can do is scream.\n\n\nCatheryn buries her head in your chest, previous bravado forgotten\n\n\n\"Oh god Aethel...\"\n\n\nYou hold her and murmur things to her in as reassuring a voice as possible. Even for you, this is difficult to watch. Almost all of the buildings are now burning on the inside now, and the fire is feeding hungrily on the mildewed rushes that scatter the floors.\n\n\nAs these are consumed by the inferno, smoke is belched out as a byproduct. This smoke, black and thick, clings to the ground in a haze. The screaming is replaced by coughing.\n\n\nThe Normans, some horrifically burnt, bend over to cough themselves hoarse. The smoke is so thick that even from where you stand, atop a high wall atop an even higher hill, you feel the need to cough. Stumbling and coughing, Norman survivors begin streaming out of the town\u0027s outskirts to rejoin their luckier compatriots on the meadow. Many others are less fortunate.\n\n\nTheir screams have faded to coughing, and soon the coughing fades to silence. All that is left is the roar of the fire. You can feel its heat, billowing up from the burning town. For now, the way to York has been made completely impassible.\n\n\nSo long as the inferno rages, the Norman host cannot safely mount another attack. Below you, the fire lets out a colossal roar as a great stone house collapses.\n\n\nYou have unleashed a monster.\n","page 700":"Rallying her army, Dierdre marches her forces back into the North, where the boats are moored.

I thought-\"\n\n\nYou cut her off briskly\n\n\n\"Have you seen Eamon?\"\n\n\nShe nods, then winces from the pain and bites her lip\n\n\n\"Mm hm, he went to fetch bandages for me\"\n\n\nShe laughs, a hollow sound with no humor behind it\n\n\n\"I told that sweet fool he should have run. We both know I\u0027m not getting out of here alive\"\n\n\nYou move in a little closer, and deftly move her hand off the wound. She inhales sharply, but lets you examine the gash. The tear is circular, and ragged around the edges, but the bleeding appears to have slowed. The wound is serious, but not untreatable.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t be stupid. That little cut won\u0027t kill you\"\n\n\nEadryth laughs through gritted teeth\n\n\n\"It\u0027s not the wound I\u0027m worried about, it\u0027s the Norman- Look out!\"\n\n\nYou spin around and deflect a sword thrust from an opportunistic Norman. The man hefts his kite shield confidently, placing his feet in a fighter\u0027s stance. You mimic him, feet matched. He teases forward with his sword, testing you. You parry every blow with quiet patience, waiting for an opening.\n\n\nThe man grins, exposing a row of ale-yellowed teeth. Then his smile turns to a grimace and he collapses to the ground. Behind him, Eamon wipes the blood from his sword with the sleeve of his soaking wet jerkin. Under his arm he has tucked a roll of cotton bandage, also sopping wet.\n\n\n\"Father?\"\n\n\nYou nod curtly, and then turn back to Eadryth\n\n\n\"Do you think you can stand?\"\n\n\nShe holds her side gingerly\n\n\n\"Probably. I can\u0027t run or fight though...\"\n\n\n\"You won\u0027t have to. Eamon, save the bandages for later; the wound isn\u0027t bleeding that much. Help her up, then the two of you need to head to the horse paddock.\"\n\n\nEamon helps Eadryth cautiously to her feet. She hisses sharply and holds the side of her chest, but otherwise makes no objection. With one arm supporting Eadryth, Eamon looks at you over his shoulder\n\n\n\"You\u0027re coming with us, right?\"\n","page 934":"Your heart burns, worse than that: it aches. Something is digging at your chest. Not something, you realize; someone, and that someone is yourself. You are the cause of the pain that you are feeling.\n\n\nYet you cannot break from your duty. You cannot yield. Not now. Not ever. With one hand holding a sword and the other braced with a shield, you have no free hand to hold your son, so instead you muster as much feeling as you can into your face\u0027s tired muscles\n\n\n\"Of course son. I\u0027ll be right behind you. Now come on, let\u0027s go!\"\n\n\nYou make sure that the path to the stables is clear, always keeping one step behind your son.\n\n\nLeashed to a large oak tree, a strong beige charger paws the ground with one hoof, spooked by the screams and the lashing rain that fill the air. You sheath your sword and lace your fingers, hoisting Eamon into the horse\u0027s saddle.\n\n\nNext, you heave Eadryth up, she gasps as her side stretches, but with Eamon\u0027s help you get her sitting in front of him. Eamon twists in the saddle to face you\n\n\n\"You\u0027ll be right behind us, right?\"\n\n\nYou lie smoothly\n\n\n\"Of course, I just need to find Thunder.

You give his horse a slap on its flanks and it takes off at a canter, eager to leave. You watch them disappear into the cloak of the heavy rain.\n\n\nThen, you begin to move, but not towards the stabling area. You have work to attend to.\n","page 933":"With one hand holding a sword and the other braced with a shield, you have no free hand to hold your son, so instead you muster as much feeling as you can into your face\u0027s tired muscles\n\n\n\"Of course son.

Now leave.\"\n\n\nFor a moment, you let your hand inch towards the knife at your hip, but you think better of it and let your hand drop. If you had your sword, you could win a duel with Eadryth, but armed only with a knife you doubt your odds. Eadryth\u0027s eyes flick between your hand, your knife, and the ground between you and her. You can tell that she is judging the distances, preparing to make a move. With her other hand she unfastens her cloak, throws it aside, and then steps into a fighting stance.\n\n\n\"I won\u0027t ask again.

It crashes into the wet logs, splattering a web of wet ash on the floor. You scream with anger and kick at the pit, scattering damp logs and moist charcoal and wet ash. Breathing hard, you collapse against the corner of the wall, head in your hands. Hot anger sweeps through you, and as it recedes it is replaced with emptiness.\n\n\nFor a long while that nothingness lingers inside of you, but eventually, after a length of quiet contemplation, you find a spark of hope that quells the emptiness. By accepting the mantle of leadership, it is up to you to guide the Kingdom of England forward. As such, you must always look ahead, never behind. You will never forget your family, but the strains of the crown will help to dampen and cloak the pain of their loss.\n\n\nYou stand up, steadying yourself against the wall. You look up and stare at the hole in the ceiling, and imagine that it is a portal to heaven itself\n\n\n\"Catheryn, Eamon, Laila, I know you can hear me\"\n\n\nThe water continues to drip down the hole. You spread your arms\n\n\n\"I love you all. I always will.\"\n\n\nYou blink back tears\n\n\n\"But, right now, England needs a strong leader. I have to be strong. Which means that I have to let you all go. Not entirely, never entirely! Just- Just, what I need is...\"\n\n\nThe water drips down from the ceiling hole, spattering against the wet ash. You grimace, feeling that familiar anger bubbling against your chest\n\n\n\"What I need, right now, is quiet!\"\n\n\nYou see the next droplet forming, but this time as it falls you reach out and catch it on your palm.\n\n\nThe water is cool and sweet against your skin. It is soft and silent.\n","page 505":"Your legs ache numbly, and you half-sit, half-collapse onto the scorched remnants of an overturned wheelbarrow. With eyes wide open but mind squeezed shut, you stare out into the void and watch the sun rise.\n","page 747":"The coronation takes place on a warm summer\u0027s day. The church in which the coronation takes place is crammed with well-wishers. Catheryn sits on a throne by your side, and in the front pews Eamon, Eadryth, Laila, Orvyn, Garyn, and Dierdre all wait expectantly. Other onlookers include members of your army, both Irish and English, as well as numerous townsfolk from every corner of London.\n\n\nOnce crowned you get straight to work, honoring your old King Harold by raising England to new heights. Old fortifications are rebuilt and restored. In the Thames, under the supervision of a team of Irish shipbuilders a fleet is constructed. The fleet is finished in 1069 and from that year on the English Channel is constantly patrolled.\n\n\nInside London the market district is expanded, and stronger economic ties are made with the kingdoms in Frisia. Your relation with Dierdre\u0027s Irish Kingdom continues to be a steadfast alliance, which is especially strengthened by Eamon\u0027s marriage to Eadryth in 1068.\n\n\nEamon chooses to stay in Ireland with Eadryth, and during his stay he takes part in the Reclamation Campaigns, in which a combined English and Irish army is used to bring Ireland under Dierdre\u0027s rule. The Campaigns are extremely successful, with Dublin falling to your forces in 1070, and all of Ireland south of the Lough Erne being brought under Dierdre\u0027s control by 1072.\n\n\nWith Eamon occupied in Ireland, you prepare Laila to be your successor. The Witenagemot makes a small outcry at the prospect of having a female ruler, but you quiet them without too much trouble. Under the mentorship of you and Catheryn, Laila grows up to be a woman of intelect and determination. Thanks to the ocassional visits of her sister in law, Eadryth, Laila becomes a competent dueler as well.\n\n\nBy 1087 England has become a pinnacle of military strength and economic prosperity; however, ruling has taken its toll and so on the summer of that year you abdicate from the throne and crown Laila.\n\n\nNow retired, you spend your years travelling between the English and Irish courts. In England you meet principally with Laila, Orvyn, and Garyn, and in Ireland you visit Dierdre, Eadryth, and Eamon. In everything, Catheryn is always at your side.\n\n\nIn 1092 Dierdre, also feeling the weight of her long years in power, hands her kingdom down to the joint rule of Eadryth and Eamon.\n\n\nYour remaining years are spent in the company of good friends and family, and you enjoy every moment greatly.\n\n\nWhen you die in 1097 hundreds attend your funeral, and you are buried under the great Cathedral at York, long since rebuilt from its Norman scourge and larger than ever before. Unlike so many other rulers, your death does not mark the end of England\u0027s prosperity. Instead, things only improve under Queen Laila\u0027s visionary leadership, and in Ireland Eamon and Eadryth, with Laila\u0027s help, conquer the North of Ireland, completing Dierdre\u0027s dream of a unified Irish Kingdom.\n\n\nWhat started as a simple rebellion has, under your dynamic leadership, become the foundations for two great nations, carried forth by your lineages.\n\n\nAnd it all began on a muddy field outside the small town of Hastings.\n","page 504":"Your hand carves through the air, cracking across her face and bloodying her lip.

Either way, I should probably go and check on them\"\n\n\nYou nod absentmindedly, Orvyn bids you a quick farewell, and then, taking in one last breath of the warm dry indoor air, he steps out into the rainstorm. You wave to him as he goes and then shut the door, muffling the roar of the storm.\n\n\nWith Orvyn gone, the house seems unbearably quiet. The wailing wind and spattering rain only magnifies the emptiness within the halls of your home. For some reason, known only by your subconscious, you feel a need for human company.

The cobbles are slick with rain and mud, and the road is strewn with damp thatch torn free from the houses by the wrath of the wind.

She reaches up with her hands and links them around your shoulders, drawing you into her embrace.

You grin\n\n\n\"I met with the witenagemot.\"\n\n\nDierdre rolls her eyes\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t keep me in suspense, you met with them, and..?\"\n\n\n\"And they elected me King of all England\"\n\n\nDierdre\u0027s smile widens\n\n\n\"So you\u0027re king now?\"\n\n\nYou shrug\n\n\n\"Well, technically I\u0027m still the regent, I only become King once-\"\n\n\nYour words are cut off when Dierdre wraps you in an iron bear hug\n\n\n\"I knew you\u0027d do it!

The tents on the field have been packed away and stowed. The soldiers have been moved into the keep. The townsfolk are either in the keep with you, or scattered amongst the neighboring villages.

Spring is in full swing, and the meadows are rich and green.\n\n\nThe scent of spring is covered by the smell of charred wood and burning grass; your men have set fire to the shrubbery around the edges of the field to eliminate any cover.

Outside the high stone walls, the lower sprawl of York is filled with the bustle of preparation. Homes near the walls of York are being torn down to prevent the Normans from easily scaling the walls, and every available room has been converted into a soldier\u0027s barrack. Though many of the locals are embittered by the noisy arrivals, the taverns and whore-houses are making excellent business. The rest of the army has been billeted on the outskirts of town. The field there is a myriad of tents blanketed by the smog of cooking-fires.\n\n\nThe woods ring with the sound of axes as fresh timber is cut to shore up defenses.

The craftsmen were only too glad to help, and one even emblazoned the front of her vest with your wolf insignia. Armed with a breastplate, greaves, shield, and sword, your wife is ready for war.\n\n\nYou can only hope that your people share her resolve, because the conflict is fast approaching.

Our infantry will charge in behind us, but we\u0027ll be on our own for the first minute or so. Let\u0027s make it count!\"\n\n\nYour riders cheer, and they follow you out into the courtyard. The great gates open with a creak, and your horses are unleashed onto the cobbled streets of the lower town. Orvyn is on your left and Mance is on your right. Together, you spur your mounts at a breakneck pace down the streets. Behind you is the deafening clatter of hooves on stone as nearly two hundred horses follow your lead. Your men are in white and black, Ryce\u0027s men are in yellow, and the Frisians are sporting their crimson colors. Like a liquid mosaic, your army spills through the narrow roads.\n\n\nThunder snorts and pants, great flanks heaving. His legs fly underneath him, and Mance and Orvyn struggle to keep pace. Gradually, the buildings around you get smaller and the cobblestoned road dissolves into a dirt track. Your moment of reckoning is near. You expect to hear the buzzing of arrows, see the sky blotted with arrowshafts, but none come. When your forces burst out of the town and onto the meadow, the Norman army is still in beautiful disarray. You let out a yell of triumph and relief.\n\n\nDrawing your sword, you point it at the heart of the Norman maelstrom\n\n\n\"Attack! Attack! For the glory of England!\"\n\n\nYour presence has finally been identified, but it is too late now. The Norman horsemen are encircled by their own infantry, and cannot muster a counter-charge. The Norman archers are in a state of confusion, and the volley they send is wild and inaccurate. Most of the arrows go over your head, though you are forced to catch one with your shield. Behind you, there are the screams of men and horse alike as arrows find their mark. You wave your sword\n\n\n\"Spread out! Spread out!\"\n\n\nYou have taken losses, but the bulk of your force remains steady. Now, the Frisians prepare to retaliate. Using their heavy javelins, they send a thick volley overhead. The projectiles arch high and then descend, raining down upon the disarray of the Norman infantry. Men scream as the javelins impale them, they lie writhing with the wicked spears stuck deep in their bodies. The line, already untidy, peels off into total chaos.\n\n\nNow it is time for the final push. Urging Thunder onward for one more spurt of energy, you drive him straight toward the Norman infantry. Trained and eager in the ways of war, Thunder obeys without hesitation. His immense weight, all bone and muscle and hoof, crashes into the Norman line with devastating effect. Shields are splintered and spears crack like matchsticks. Running out of momentum, Thunder rears and begins to kick, smashing jaws and crushing ribs. You use your long sword like a cleaver, hacking and cutting through the terrified soldiers. The rest of your horsemen are similarly entangled, and they fight with equal gusto. Assaulted with such ferocity, the Norman frontline begins to shatter.\n\n\nStill, the fight is far from over. The Normans are forming pockets of resistance, and their reserves are struggling to fill in the gaps. Surrounded, some of your lead horsemen are dragged from their saddles and butchered. Low-flying volleys of arrows pepper your ragged cavalry force, and men shriek as they are struck by feathered shafts. Your arm is aching from swinging your blade, but if you let the tide of Norman soldiers draw close you will be killed. Thunder bucks and rears, bowling men over with powerful hoof strikes. His flanks and legs are bleeding from numerous spear-wounds. You scream above the pandemonium\n\n\n\"Keep holding! Help will be here soon!\"\n\n\nThen, as you say it, so it appears. Your own infantry, having sprinted down the streets and up the meadow, crashes like a tidal wave into the disorganized Norman front. A Norman tries to drive a spear into Thunder\u0027s throat and is cut down by one of Ryce\u0027s infantrymen. Like a river your infantry flows around you, driving deep into the bulk of the Norman forces. The center of William\u0027s line is in utter shambles.\n","page 906":"\"If we\u0027re going to do this, we need to move fast.

Instead you take her hand and kiss that.\n\n\n\"When we both return to York, we will be free!\"\n","page 909":"You lose yourself in the fighting. The blood is like an alcohol, and you are in the throws of an addiction. You have taken on the role of death, and you dole it out as you drive deeper into the Norman forces. All around you your infantry swarm like sharks, hungering to tear apart the beast that you have mortally wounded. Again and again, you send Thunder crashing into the fray, and Mance and Orvyn are always quick to follow, widening the gap.\n\n\nMany of the Normans waver and break ranks, shoving their compatriots out of the way in their desperation to escape. Others are petrified by their fear, and are cut down where they stand. Yet others hold true to their honor and courage, and they cut bloody swathes with their longswords, cleaving into horseflesh and chainmail, rider and infantry, with equal ferocity.\n\n\nThe gaps begin to close and the fighting grows fierce, so you pull Thunder back momentarily and leap from his saddle. You land heavily on your feet, but are quick to regain your balance. Dismounted, you rejoin the fray.\n\n\nThe killing is hot and wild. You fight with maniacal fervor, working your way deeper and deeper into the center of this Norman knot, cutting through it with Gordian efficiency. Mance and Orvyn have also joined you in dismounting, and they protect your flanks.

Now that your infantry is deeply meshed with the Norman forces, the best thing you can do is stay out of their way. Maneuvering your horse back behind the rear of your infantry, you assess the situation. The Norman center is crumpling, and although many of their cavalry have escaped the jaws of your infantry, the Frisians are pursuing them with merciless efficiency through the hills. The English armies who have joined in support of the Normans are unscathed, yet they have not engaged with your forces. Instead they are waiting.\n\n\nYou consider crossing over to them to attempt a parley, but something else catches your eye. At the rearguard of the Norman army, surrounded by a clot of bodyguards, is King William. You smile a predatory smile. This is your chance. Raising your sword hand, you flail it wildly\n\n\n\"Cavalry, to me! Riders to me!\"\n\n\nThe Frisians are busy riding down the rest of the Norman cavalry, and many of the other riders are engaged in hit and run maneuvers on the Norman flanks, but you still manage to accumulate a force of some sixty horsemen. They are a motley crew, but Mance and Orvyn are with you, and that is enough. You shout to them over the chaos of the battlefield\n\n\n\"We\u0027re going to swing around the outside of the battle and attack William\u0027s position from behind. If he falls, the Normans will be dealt a crippling blow and his English lackeys will almost certainly side with us!\"\n\n\n With the plan decided upon, you spur your fatigued horse onward, swinging wide around the battlegrounds. Moving to the left of the Norman force, your horses skirt through the gap between the besieged Normans and their uncertain English allies.\n\n\nAs you pass through the gap, you notice the glum visage of Acwellen watching you from his position within the subservient English army. You raise your hand in salutation, and he inclines his head in return. You pass through the gap unmolested by either side. The Normans are too hard-pressed to be concerned with a small party of horsemen, and the Norman-allied English are still sitting on the fence, unwilling to fight for either party until a clear victor becomes apparent.\n\n\nOnce you are behind the Norman lines, you gain the unwanted attention of a handful of Norman archers, but the majority has their backs to you and do not notice your presence. They are too busy launching volley after volley into the wave of English warriors who are slowly but surely grinding the Norman infantry into the ground. The archers who have noticed you are screaming to their comrades in french, but their insights are lost amongst the wild tumult of voices. They manage to fire off a ragged volley, but most of the projectiles fall short. Of your entire group, only four men are hit. They cry out and tumble from their saddles, their bodies pierced by cruel broadheads.\n\n\nYou cannot look back. Your eyes are fixated on the knot of men in the Norman rear, for in their center waits King William. The circle of bodyguards know that you are coming, but most of them are armed with swords, and they can do little to halt the momentum of your charge. Thunder crashes once more into the fray, and Mance and Orvyn are quick to follow, widening the gap.\n\n\nMany of the Normans waver and break ranks, running away in terror. Others stand petrified, and are cut down by your riders. Yet others hold true to their honor and courage, and they cut bloody swathes with their longswords, cleaving into horseflesh and chainmail with equal ferocity.\n\n\nThe gaps begin to close and the fighting grows fierce, so you pull Thunder back momentarily and leap from his saddle.

Mance and Orvyn have also joined you, and they protect your flanks. Other men join your trio, and an arrowhead is formed, the tip pointing towards the center of the Norman formation. You are the tip, and you are pointing towards King William.\n\n\nWhen you finally break through, your arm is screaming in agony and you are bleeding from a dozen minor wounds. King William faces you, both hands gripping a gold-gilded sword, face set with grim resignation. In your current state of fatigue, any decent warrior could cut you to pieces, but King William, though a fine strategist, is no warrior. He faces you with admirable courage, but he knows there can be no victory. You have won. He inclines his head with almost deferential politeness, slush-colored eyes flickering\n\n\n\"Lord Aethelwulf, so we meet face to face once more\"\n\n\nYou grit your teeth, panting with exhaustion\n\n\n\"So we do. The next time we meet, it will be in the afterlife\"\n\n\nKing William shrugs\n\n\n\"So it will be. Good luck, my lord, you shall need it. Life is a long and twisted road.\"\n\n\nHe charges towards you. You charge towards him. Your blades cross once, twice, and once more. The tip of your sword slips into his throat. King William, once ruler of England, is no more.\n\n\nHis death spreads like a ripple through the Norman army. Resistance crumples, and many lay down their arms. The English allies finally make their decision, abandoning their Norman liege lords and joining in coalition with your forces to rout the last of the Norman resistance.\n\n\nAll across the battlefield there is a noise louder than the cries of the wounded, and louder still than the shrieks of the carrion crows.\n\n\nIt is the sound of your name being chanted by thousands of voices, again and again and again.\n","page 244":"You decide to join Dierdre, walking around the table you take caution not to jostle any of the people seated at the overcrowded benches.

But, you reason, when has war ever been sane?\n\n\nYour ship\u0027s oars beat the water into a froth, heaving your vessel forward. Towards the killing ground.\n\n\nSomeone taps at your shoulder, turning, you recognize the ship\u0027s captain, who wrings his hands nervously, he tries to speak to you but continuously interrupts himself with a continuous stream of prayers\n\n\n\"Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Lord, what in God\u0027s name are we doing! Jesus-\"\n\n\nA Norman arrow hisses towards him and you catch it with your shield\n\n\n\"Stay at the back of the boat, by the tiller\"\n\n\nThe man scurries away, still muttering his prayers. You whisper just one, a quick prayer your father taught you as a boy. Beside you, Orvyn speaks excitedly to himself in Gaelic. His cruel axe gleams in the light, and his impatience is palpable. You shift the shoulder strap of your longsword, testing its weight and security. Most likely, in the madness and closeness of the assault, you will have little cause to use the longsword, but you still want to make sure that it at the very least keeps out of your way.\n\n\nThe beach draws closer now, and the arrow rain thickens, though it is nowhere near as heavy as it was at Hastings. Of the five hundred men you see that only perhaps fifty are archers, the rest are infantry. Another arrow streaks towards you and Orvyn catches it with his shield. As the distance closes, Dierdre\u0027s ship begins to pull ahead, dragon prow snarling at the defending Normans.\n\n\nYou begin to judge the distance between you and the shore. Fifty meters. The Norman infantry begins to press forward, men wincing as they step into the frigid winter waters of the ocean, which laps hungrily at their knees.\n\n\nTwenty meters. Some of the Irish warriors carry slings, and they begin loosing stones at the Norman soldiers, who are forced to raise their heavy blue kite shields to protect themselves. Some of the stones find chinks in the armor, whirring stones striking limbs and throats. The Normans who are hit by the slingstones stagger back and slip underneath the frigid water. Some resurface, or are hauled up by their colleagues. Those who are struck in the face or throat do not.\n\n\nTen meters now. Both sides, Norman and Anglo-Irish, begin hurling javelins and throwing spears. One, a ragged spear with steel broadhead and oak shaft, lodges itself into a gap of wood beside the prow of your boat. Sheathing your sword, you tear the spear from the wood of the ship and fling it back, striking a Norman soldier in the hip, just under his shield. He screams as the seawater burns into his wound, which worsens as he struggles and the spear tears deeper. Two of the men beside him try to drag the man away from the frontline, but as the turn their backs on the approaching ships, one is hit by a javelin in his shoulder and the other is felled by a slingstone to the back of the neck. Other Normans try to fill in the gap, but a steady barrage of projectiles keeps them at bay. You nudge Orvyn and point to the chaotic spectacle\n\n\n\"There. that\u0027s where we\u0027ll disembark\"\n\n\nHe nods and relays the command back to the captain. The ship tilts slightly, aligning its prow to the concave section of the Norman line.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Dierdre\u0027s ship reaches the shallows, and her warriors begin to disembark. At their head, Queen Dierdre herself leaps off of the ship\u0027s prow and lands on top of a Norman soldier, and for a moment both are fully submerged in the frigid winter waters. Then Dierdre emerges, sword slick with watery blood. The Norman soldier does not resurface.\n\n\nAround her, other Irish warriors form a perimeter, cutting through the loosened Norman formation. Many of her warriors fight without much armor, bare-chested despite the cold. They fight like mad too, you watch an Irish woman (skin more blue than white from all the warpaint) leap onto the shield of a Norman warrior, drag him under the water and then cut his throat, all while screaming at the top of her lungs in Gaelic.\n\n\nThen, suddenly, your boat\u0027s keel slams into the loose sand of the beach and you hop into the frigid water, stiffening briefly as the chill works its way up your legs. Being somewhat disoriented by the water\u0027s frigidity, you are taken completely off guard by a Norman soldier, who swings at you from above with a sword. You deflect the blow with your shield, but the impact knocks you deeper into the water. Triumphantly, the Norman prepares to drive his blade forward, but Orvyn, probably trying to emulate Dierdre\u0027s magnificent entry, leaps from the side of the boat and onto the Norman warrior. Unfortunately, because of the weight of his chanmail, he miscalculates, and instead of gutting the Norman, he only clips his shoulder, sending them both under the water in a tangle of arms and shields and blades.\n\n\nYou stand, uncertain for a moment, not wanting to lash out wildly for fear of hitting Oryn, but then two heads emerge, one has black hair and the other has blonde. You shove your sword down the blonde-haired one\u0027s throat. Orvyn steadies himself against the slick wood of the prow, spitting water and laughing\n\n\n\"Well, that didn\u0027t really work out as planned\"\n\n\nYou laugh too, and clap him on the shoulder, hand slapping wetly against his drenched chainmail.\n\n\n\"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s kill some more Normans\"\n\n\nBy now, most of your men have hopped off the ship and are forming up around you. You slam your sword wetly against your shield\n\n\n\"Alright boys, I\u0027m cold, and wet, and the only thing separating us from a warm fire is a couple Norman pricks. So let\u0027s form a shieldwall, and show them what we English are made of!\"\n","page 493":"In your dreams you see it all in vivid clarity.\n\n\nYou watch from a hill as the serpent of Normans, led by William\u0027s own son, marches towards York, surrounding it on all sides.\n\n\nHigh above, you watch as the walls of York are breached and Normans pour into the courtyard.

We\u0027re going to punch straight through these Norman bastards!\"\n\n\nYour men let out a cheer and before any have a chance to contemplate the ludicrousness of the decision, you charge.\n\n\nThe Norman forces close together, holding their blue kite shields tentatively. At the head of the formation, you choose your target; a grizzled looking veteran with a flanged mace.\n\n\nAs you close the distance, you switch from a jog to a sprint, and when the grizzled Norman swings his mace you block it with your shield and slam into him with your body, knocking him off his feet. The man to his left tries to stab at you while you are vulnerable, but Garyn stabs him in the gut, then kicks him aside and continues onward. The Norman veteran tries to get back up, but you slam the pommel of your sword into his jaw, cracking it audibly. You leap back up and continue pressing forward, to your right Orvyn\u0027s axe becomes caught in a Norman shield but you slide your own sword across the soldier\u0027s knee and he screams in French before being impaled by a spear thrust from someone behind you.\n\n\nIn front of you, a young man with helmet askew and sword gripped too tightly simply runs away, pushing his companions out of order in his mad desperation to escape. the fear is beginning to spread across the Norman line. You hear, rather than see, that Dierdre\u0027s forces on the other side have compressed the Norman \u0027U\u0027 into a squiggly \u0027I\u0027. To reinforce the point, the young Norman trying so desperately to escape you is suddenly thrown backwards. Embedded in his chest is a short throwing spear with the characteristic Gaelic characters etched in blue paint along the shaft. Your attention is quickly diverted as a Norman sword comes flashing down at you, you parry instinctively and prepare to strike when suddenly the soldier is thrown aside and you are confronted by a bloody Irish warrior who tries to cut your arm off with a heavy axe. Irritably, you bat the axe aside with your blade and then slam your shield into his gut\n\n\n\"We\u0027re on the same side you idiot!\"\n\n\nThe poor man clearly doesn\u0027t speak English, but the wolf\u0027s head on your shield makes him realize his mistake all the same and he stammers (what you assume is) an apology in Gaelic before rushing back into the fighting. You shake your head in annoyance\n\n\n\"Alright boys, let\u0027s disengage and drop back! There are many ways I want to die, getting murdered by my ally isn\u0027t one of them!\"\n\n\nYour men break off from their individual conflicts, either finishing off downed Norman soldiers or else simply kicking them into the waiting arms of the Gaelic warriors in front of them.\n\n\nDropping back, you scan your surroundings. Most of the Norman army is desperately fighting the Irish army, however a few small groups of Normans have detached and are fleeing the battlefield, many throwing down their weapons and shields. By now, the Norman flanks have begun to curve inward on themselves, forming a hopeless \u0027O\u0027. In the center a tired looking Norman with blood down the front of his mailshirt, and clotted in his hair as well holds up a blood soaked sword, and then drops it onto the bloody sand below him. He croaks in rough English\n\n\n\"We surrender! Nous nous rendons!\"\n\n\nAcross from the Norman line you spot Dierdre, her whole body a deep bloody red. She shrugs, but you nod firmly\n\n\n\"Any Norman who drops their weapons may live!\"\n\n\nThe tired Norman quickly relays your command in French and the other soldiers hastily drop their weapons and shields. You turn to your men and do a quick head count. Twenty four. That\u0027s everyone. You grin and raise your bloody sword into the air\n\n\n\"God loves us! This is a sign! He has chosen us, us to rule England!\"\n\n\nYou point your sword inland\n\n\n\"This is our land, our country! And we are going to take it back! Every! Last! Piece!\"\n\n\nYour men cheer, and Dierdre starts a victory cry amongst her warriors, and meanwhile you sit down on the icy sand and watch the red-tinted water of the incoming tide consume the corpses of the Norman army.\n","page 495":"Eamon\u0027s eyes bore plaintively into your own\n\n\n\"All of them?\"\n\n\nHe has already asked this a dozen times, and each time you answer, and a fresh dagger it driven into your heart.\n\n\n\"Yes. All of them.\"\n\n\nIn your mind\u0027s eye you watch with incredible detail as Laila runs through a field of grass and wildflowers. The wind plucks at her golden hair and her laugh is like the tinkling of a thousand chimes. Catheryn is there too, leaning coolly against a noble oak tree, watching with an amused expression on her perfect face. You want to join them. You want to join them so badly, you want to run with them both in that open grassy field, run with them under the blue sky and white clouds and quiet breeze-\n\n\nInstead you kneel in your tent, holding Eamon close as he sobs into your shoulder. Your own tears itch at your eyes, but for some reason they refuse to fall. While Eamon weeps, you sit in desolate silence.\n","page 252":"With the Irish making devastating inroads into the right flank of the Norman assembly, you decide to press from the left.\n\n\nRallying your men behind you into and arrowhead formation, you pound your way through the surf towards dry sand, shredding any Norman that gets in your way.\n\n\nBuckling to meet your charge, the Norman line begins to curve into a \u0027U\u0027, with the left side facing off against your force and the right side actively battling Dierdre\u0027s.

Many die from the harsh Northern conditions, and many more die from the harsh Northern inhabitants; the Picts.\n\n\nBy 1063 only Catheryn and twenty two others remain, however they find refuge in a small town on the eastern border of Strathclyde.

Dierdre and I will fight, one on one. If I win, we keep the fleet. If she wins, she gets the fleet. Garyn nods carefully, but his face makes his intentions plain; whether you win or lose, he will not give up those ships without a fight. Dierdre sees it too, and chuckles drily\n\n\n\"Ah well, at least I get to kill you, Aethelwulf.\"\n\n\nShe takes a step towards you\n\n\n\"That will whet my appetite for when I slaughter your men after\"\n\n\nYou wave at Garyn, motioning for him to return to the ships.

You will spare them\"\n\n\nDierdre nods calmly\n\n\n\"If they surrender, unconditionally, yes. I would say that you\u0027d do the same, but I honestly don\u0027t know if you would\"\n\n\nYou open your mouth to defend yourself against her remark when suddenly something lances towards you and you twist out of the way just in time to avoid a lightning-quick strike from Dierdre\u0027s blade. Her eyes are poison and her mouth is a jagged snarl.\n\n\n\"I will take great pleasure in killing you, Aethelwulf\"\n\n\nYou grit your teeth and get into a proper fighting stance\n\n\n\"I wish I could feel the same\"\n\n\nDierdre smiles sweetly, then leaps forward, parrying your long sword deftly and driving her boot against the lower rim of your shield. The force jars your arm, forcing you back and giving you only just enough time to block a hammer blow that Dierdre drives into your shield, splitting the wood. Twisting the shield away from your body, you heave your sword forward, but Dierdre is already dancing away, carving delicate patterns in the air with her sword.\n\n\nSuddenly, she whips her blade leftwards, but in an incredible display of swordsmanship, she flicks her wrist and with terrible speed the sword is hurtling towards you on the right side of your body instead.\n\n\nParrying desperately, you drive the flat of your long sword\u0027s blade against hers. You try to lock your pommel against hers, but she disengages, slipping behind you and kicking you hard in the back of your leg. You cry out in pain, dropping to one knee and holding your shield up to protect yourself. Instead of pressing her advantage, Dierdre waits patiently for you to regain your footing.\n\n\nYou assess the injury to your foot carefully; it hurts like hell, but it can still support your weight. For now anyways. Dierdre smirks and drops her off hand to finger the hilt of her other sword, which has remained sheathed in its scabbard. Even with one sword and no shield, Dierdre is clearly winning. If you were twenty years younger, maybe you would\u0027ve stood a chance, but now...\n\n\nFor the first time in a long time, you fear the end. This time, however, you know that it will end for real. Dierdre shifts her weight from one foot to the other\n\n\n\"You done yet?\"\n\n\nYou regain your position stiffly, hefting your long sword with an arm that aches and feels lead-heavy. As an afterthought, you loosen the straps of your battered round-shield quickly and drop it to the sand at your feet.\n\n\n\"Oh yes, Dierdre. I am done.\"\n\n\nYou leap forward, every muscle working in a concerted effort. Dierdre parries your first blow, but you follow up with a second, and then a third, and then a fourth, each blow crashing into Dierdre\u0027s blade, which is now flecked with indentations. Dierdre keeps on backing up, and although her poise is still excellent and her resolve remains unwavering, she is no longer smiling. For the first time since this fight began, Dierdre has to concentrate.\n\n\nYour arms feel waterlogged and deadened, but you ignore the sensation and press your attack doggedly onwards. You strike again, and Dierdre parries, and again, and Dierdre parries, and again, and-\n\n\nYour long sword crunches into her blade, shearing it in half. Perhaps, just perhaps, you can win this fight. Yet in that same instant you realize that you cannot. The unexpected lack of resistance to your strike has knocked you off-balance, throwing you towards Dierdre. It happens in only a second, yet it feels like forever.\n\n\nYou can only watch helplessly as Dierdre ducks under your off-kilter sword strike, and plunges the jagged remains of her sword into your chest. The mail links you wear offer no protection, they shatter under the force of the blow, allowing the cold steel of Dierdre\u0027s broken sword to pierce deep into your chest.\n\n\nYou drop down on your hands and knees. Everything feels heavy. You collapse on your side, and the pain is so intense that for a moment your vision goes dark. You taste blood in your mouth, at first you think that maybe you bit your tongue, but the blood keeps flowing, hot and thick, and you realize that the blood is coming from inside your throat; you have a punctured lung.\n\n\nYour death is inevitable, only one thing matters now\n\n\n\"Dierdre... my f-family... please...\"\n\n\nDierdre drops down beside you, and her breath trickles across your face\n\n\n\"If they surrender, they will be spared. Goodbye Aethelwulf\"\n\n\nThat said, she gets up, brushing sand deftly from her legs, and walks away.\n\n\nYou to follow her with your eyes, but they are unresponsive and your vision is beginning to narrow. You see hazy sand, stained crimson with flowering blood.\n\n\nThen you see darkness.\n\n\n \n\nAnd then you see nothing.\n","page 235":"You bite your lip awkwardly\n\n\n\"The problem is, well, my son- my son\"\n\n\nYou sigh in exasperation\n\n\n\"He\u0027s in love, to a commoner at that, but I haven\u0027t the heart to refuse him\"\n\n\nThere is a moment of silence in which you wait uncomfortably.

Dierdre doesn\u0027t even spare you another glance, she screams a command in Gaelic and the Irish line billows outwards, engulfing the petrified Norman line in the shallows of the river. Just a few meters in front of your position the world has descended into a madness of limbs and blades and blood.\n\n\nYour men look to you expectantly. You roll your eyes\n\n\n\"What the hell. Let\u0027s go boys!\"\n\n\nLeaping, you enter the fray alongside your men and swing your blade down at the Norman in front of you. He raises his kite shield awkwardly, but your strike combines the force of your blow with your own body weight and when the blade connects it shears straight through the kite shield, splintering the frame. The blade only stops when it becomes lodged in the Norman\u0027s shoulder. He screams horribly and falls into the frigid waters of the river, nearly dragging your sword in with him. Wrenching back, you free your sword from the Norman\u0027s flesh and press onward, parrying a spear thrust and leaving an opening for Garyn, who ducks in and drives his blade into the Norman soldier\u0027s gut, shattering the chainmail links.\n\n\nAll around you the Norman line is disintegrating, melting into confusion and chaos. Normans from further down the line are rushing to their comrades\u0027 support, but they soon find themselves under attack from Dierdre\u0027s Irish troops, who have followed your lead and are diving into the Norman forces, hacking them to pieces. Meanwhile your world has disappeared into a flurry of limbs, swords, and shields. Faces whirl around you, Normans and English, and Irish now too, all locked together in a crazed tangle. On the far side of the river, Normans are scrambling across the frigid mud on all fours, desperate to escape the killing behind them.\n\n\nThe water is so cold that it burns you, tongues of water lapping at your waist like arms of fire, simultaneously burning you and dragging you down. You scream encouragement, throat ragged and throbbing\n\n\n\"They\u0027re losing! They\u0027re losing! Break through to river bank! This day is ours!\"\n\n\nThe Irish who have now swelled your ranks likely have no idea what you said, but the understand the tone well enough and they add their voices to your cries, screaming and spitting in the faces of their terrified Norman adversaries. Having just cut another Norman soldier down, you step forward, and your foot presses into a muddy incline; you are nearing the edge of the river\n\n\n\"Keep pushing! We\u0027re nearly there!\"\n\n\nA Norman soldier shoves his spear at you, you slam your shield down and knock the shaft deep into the muck of the river. As he struggles to free the spear, you drive your sword into his throat. He falls mutely, and, just like that, you have broken through. You search with an animal hunger for another enemy, but no one presents themselves.\n\n\nThe Norman line has been broken, their soldiers have either fled or are dead in the red-soaked river. You feel like laughing.\n\n\nUntil you hear the horse hooves. You look up and see that the fifty Norman riders are charging your disorganized position.\n\n\n\"Form up!\"\n\n\nYou scream, and then scream it again\n\n\n\"Form up, you bastards! Form up! Now!\"\n\n\nHurriedly, your men stand beside you and lock shields. The Irish take a little longer, many have stayed behind to finish off the wounded Normans who line the riverbed. You turn briefly and see the Irish trudge slowly towards your line. You feel like screaming with wild exasperation. You wave at them with your sword\n\n\n\"Move, you idiots! Get up here!\"\n\n\nWith slightly more hurry and a significant amount of indignation the Irish warriors slosh through the shallows of the river and take their positions along the length of your shieldline, bare skin steaming in the cold air. Satisfied, you turn to face the riders, who have closed most of the distance and are barreling down upon your position.\n\n\nYou face the man cantering towards you and realize with a sudden shock that he is riding Thunder, your horse. This gives you an idea, when the horsemen get close enough, an uncomfortable ten meters that shudders the ground at your feet, you yell at the top of your ragged lungs\n\n\n\"Thunder! Buck!\"\n\n\nRearing its head, the massive black warhorse flails its hoofs wildly, slamming into horses on either side. When the Norman riding him saws at the reigns desperately, Thunder whips his head around and bites his hand with his thick teeth, cracking bone. The charge disintegrates into a wild mess of horse hooves and broken long-spears.\n\n\nYour own horse has remained standing, and has managed to dislodge its temporary owner. Lips flared and teeth gnashing, it charges towards you, throwing up a spray of mud and muck as it comes to a halt beside you. The Irish warriors eye it warily, but you pat its cheek affectionately before hauling yourself into its saddle.\n\n\nMounted, you point your sword at the chaotic tangle of Norman riders\n\n\n\"Charge! Kill them all!\"\n\n\nIrish and English alike surge forwards in a wave of ferocity, though your men are careful to rescue their horses from the melee. You remain aloof of the fighting and once a suitable number of your party are mounted you point to the remaining soldiers of the retreating Norman infantry\n\n\n\"Form a circle around those men!\"\n\n\nYou flick at the reigns gently and Thunder leaps into action, galloping purposefully towards the exhausted troop of Normans. Once your men have made a loose circle around the force, you give the soldiers an ultimatum\n\n\n\"Normans! This battle is lost! Lay down your weapons, or die!\"\n\n\nIn the center of the harried Norman circle a tired looking soldier with blood down the front of his mailshirt, and clotted in his hair as well, holds up a blood soaked sword, and then drops it onto the dry ground below him. He croaks in rough English\n\n\n\"We surrender! Nous nous rendons!\"\n\n\nGaryn looks at you pointedly, but you shake your head\n\n\n\"Any Norman who drops their weapons may live! You have my word!\"\n\n\nThe tired Norman quickly relays your command in French and the other soldiers hastily drop their weapons and shields. You turn to your men and do a quick head count. Twenty four. That\u0027s everyone. You grin and raise your bloody sword into the air\n\n\n\"God loves us! This is a sign! He has chosen us, us to rule England!\"\n\n\nYou point your sword inland\n\n\n\"This is our land, our country! And we are going to take it back! Every! Last! Piece!\"\n\n\nYour men cheer, and Dierdre starts a victory cry amongst her warriors, and meanwhile you sit astride your warhorse and watch the burbling river behind you wash the blood of the Norman army downstream.\n","page 8":"Hidden by the dense screen of trees, twelve thousand Norman warriors wait.

You shift uncomfortably, and you chainmail clinks audibly in the heavy silence. Several heads turn swiftly at the abrupt noise and beside you Dierdre places a finger to her lips. The message is clear: shut up. You roll your eyes and lie back down carefully on the dry ground beneath you, a position that you have been maintaining for nearly an hour.\n\n\nDierdre stretches silently, unlike you, she and her men wear leather, daubed with mud and moss for camouflage. To disguise the glitter of your mailshirt you have wrapped a tawdry wool cloak around yourself, much to the amusement of Dierdre\u0027s warriors. These warriors are among Dierdre\u0027s finest, skilled raiders accustomed to lying in wait beside a road for hours before striking. Today, you are lying in wait for a moderate party of Normans, around thirty strong, rumored to be in the area. Instead of riding in and cutting them down, as you would have preferred, Dierdre has decided to send one of her warriors out to lure them into the clearing where you all wait.\n\n\nYou scratch idly at the dirt, drawing striations in the earth with your finger. Needless to say, the boredom is killing you. And yet, you are still here. You are still here because you know it will work, as it has worked countless times before.\n\n\nFor a month you have been conducting these ambushes around the northern countryside, and the effects are clearly visible. Norman patrols seldom leave their castles anymore, and tax collectors have all but disappeared from the North. By day, the commonfolk toil in their fields, silently cursing the Normans and praising your attempts to dislodge them. By night, they raise their axes and pitchforks and scour the forests for Normans to harass.\n\n\nThese attacks prompt repercussions, and Norman soldiers quickly march towards the villages in question, intent on butchering the rebellious farmers. Which brings them right to you.\n\n\nYou grin and grip your longsword, which is hidden under a pile of dead leaves beside you. Your short sword is safely tucked in its scabbard at your side. Like all of Dierdre\u0027s fighters, you carry no shield, which would only hinder you in the wild fighting of these forest clashes. There are no shieldwalls, and no cohesive lines. Each man (and woman, in the case of several of Dierdre\u0027s warriors) fights as an individual. You only have fifteen soldiers with you, including the scout Dierdre sent as bait, but you are not terribly worried; these warriors seem proficient. Each of them carries a projectile of some kind, be it spear, sling, or bundle of javelins. Each also carries either an axe or sword and a knife. All are covered in the thick blue warpaint that they never seem to remove. An Irish warrior on Dierdre\u0027s left carries a long knife carved from human bone. Another wears a chestpiece of sinew woven between human ribs. No, you affirm, I doubt we\u0027ll run into any serious trouble.\n\n\nYou hear footsteps; moving quick. You move your sword a little, making sure it isn\u0027t snagged on anything. You hear breathing, ragged. You raise the sword a little, several leaves peel away from the blade, exposing its shimmering surface. Suddenly, a young man swathed in ragged green clothing carrying a long knife bounds into the clearing. None of the Eriu warriors move to attack him, you realize belatedly that he is the scout that Dierdre sent earlier to lure the Normans towards you. Catching his breath, he speaks to Dierdre in rapid Gaelic. She nods and flicks her attention towards you\n\n\n\"Get ready, he says they\u0027re coming\"\n\n\nYou grin and edge yourself into a crouched position, shielded from view behind a thick oak tree. All of Dierdre\u0027s warriors have similarly hidden themselves. You wait, holding your sword vertically, pressing it into the shadow of the tree. You hear many feet crackling through bare underbrush. You hear shouting, in French. You whisper across to Dierdre\n\n\n\"Let the first few pass, then we strike\"\n\n\nShe nods, and then peeks carefully around the corner of her tree. You see her eyes flash back and forth, then she ducks back behind cover. She holds up four fingers, then five on the other hand, opening the hand, then closing it, then opening it again, this time with four fingers. You mouth \u0027okay\u0027. Each finger represents an approaching soldier, and each hand a position. As per the plan, you will let the initial four pass by, then you and Dierdre will attack the nine men in the following group. Once the other warriors have finished killing the four Normans, they will attack from the flanks.\n\n\nYou breath in and out, readying yourself. You wish Orvyn was here, he had a knack for this sort of thing. He is, however, in the field as well, stalking another group of Normans with Garyn and a small crew of English and Irish. The pounding and crunching gets closer, and suddenly the four Norman soldiers have run past you, completely oblivious to your presence.\n\n\nYou smile grimly, they still believe they are the ones who are hunting, not the other way around. You hear more trampling. This is it. You hear heavy breathing, more footsteps.\n\n\nYou take a final breath, then step out from behind cover and swing your sword. The blow catches the running Norman straight across the neck, digging into the bone. You tear the sword free and, before any of the other Normans can react, you drive your sword into the stomach of another, shattering the links of his mailshirt. Ripping the sword free, you duck back and face your opponents.\n\n\nThree men face you, two carrying spears and the third bearing both a sword and kite shield. Leaping forward with a snarling yell you deflect a spear thrust with your blade then backswing the longsword into the face of the other spear-carrier. He steps back and you duck under the shaft of his spear, skewering up with your sword and snaking the blade under his mailshirt and into his chest. Kicking the dying man back you leave your longsword embedded in his chest and turn, slapping aside a sword-thrust with your mail-covered forearm.\n\n\nThe remaining two soldiers circle you cautiously, but then suddenly the one with the spear collapses; his throat has been cut from behind. In his place stands Dierdre, bloody and triumphant. In her hands she holds two reddened short swords.\n\n\nThe final Norman turns to face Dierdre but then is struck on the shoulder by an Irish slingstone. As he recoils in shock you wrench your longsword free of the Norman corpse and drive the blade through his armpit and into his chest. You nod briefly to Dierdre\n\n\n\"Thanks\"\n\n\nShe is already turning to face the next group of Normans, the remaining seventeen of the thirty. They face you and Dierdre cautiously, weapons raised, feet testing the ground for purchase. Their caution is their undoing. In a flash the forest is thick with Dierdre\u0027s warriors, attacking the Norman force on all sides. You charge at a Norman carrying a mace, but he falls backward, a javelin piercing through his eye.\n\n\nInstead, you face a Norman fleeing from a pair of Irish warriors. As he passes, you swing your sword in a heavy downward cut, biting into the leather of his boots and sweeping him off his feet. As he struggles to rise you bury your longsword in his chest. You rip the sword free and search for a new opponent, but find none.\n\n\nThe Normans are all dead, and the forest is silent once more. You wipe your sword clean with a swath of cloth. All that\u0027s left now is to strip the Normans of their weapons and armor, and then hide the bodies in a ditch. Then you can head home.\n\n\nYou sling the longsword over your back and think to yourself smugly; all in a good day\u0027s work.\n","page 274":"Dierdre lounges on a rotten log at the edge of a meadow on your town\u0027s outskirts, watching her men set up camp.

The bodies litter the streets, both human and livestock, thrown together in pitiful bloody heaps.\n\n\nYou find the two men that you left to look after the horses as well.

You say a quick prayer for both, and give a eulogy in which you mention them both by name and recite their deeds, as you do for every household soldier who has died serving you. When you finish the corpses are lowered into their respective graves. One, who had no children, is buried with his weapons and armor. The other, who had a young son, is relieved of his sword, so that it might be taken back to his kin.\n\n\nAs for the five dead Normans, their bodies are thrown into a pile of thatch and then set alight.

Some try to escape to your right, across the beach, but Dierdre has sent some of her skirmishers around the top of the \u0027U\u0027 and they have formed up along the same position where you had originally attacked the Norman line. The Normans, now hemmed in on all sides, begin to fall back.\n\n\nIn front of you, a young man with helmet askew and sword gripped too tightly simply runs away, pushing his companions out of the way in his mad desperation to escape. the fear is beginning to spread across the Norman line. The young Norman trying so desperately to escape you is suddenly thrown backwards. Embedded in his chest is a short throwing spear with the characteristic Gaelic characters etched in blue paint along the shaft. Your attention is quickly diverted as a Norman sword comes flashing down at you, you parry instinctively and prepare to strike when suddenly the soldier is thrown aside and you are confronted on your right by a bloody Irish warrior who tries to cut your arm off with a heavy axe.

The Irish warriors have now completely surrounded the remaining Normans, and the blue of the frothing sea is mixed with the red of Norman blood. In the center of the Norman force a tired looking soldier with blood down the front of his mailshirt, and clotted in his hair as well, holds up a blood soaked sword, and then drops it into the  hungry water below him. He croaks in rough English\n\n\n\"We surrender! Nous nous rendons!\"\n\n\nAcross from the Norman line you spot Dierdre, her whole body a deep bloody red. She shrugs, but you nod firmly\n\n\n\"Any Norman who drops their weapons may live!\"\n\n\nThe tired Norman quickly relays your command in French and the other Norman soldiers hastily drop their weapons and shields.\n\n\nYou search for your men, and the division you sent with Orvyn and Garyn, and do a quick head count. Twenty four. That\u0027s everyone. You grin and raise your bloody sword into the air\n\n\n\"God loves us! This is a sign!

The bodies litter the streets, both human and livestock, thrown together in pitiful bloody heaps.\n\n\nYou find the two men that you left to look after the horses as well. Both have been crucified, arms and legs nailed to lashed beams stolen from broken houses. You glare at the five Normans who Dierdre\u0027s scouts found.

You order that your two crucified soldiers be cut down from their crosses so that they might be buried properly.\n\n\nLater, when the sun begins to flare orange and the stars begin to creep into the darkening sky, you lay your men to rest in a pair of hastily dug graves marked with stones. You say a quick prayer for both, and give a eulogy in which you mention them both by name and recite their deeds, as you do for every household soldier who has died serving you. When you finish the corpses are lowered into their respective graves. One, who had no children, is buried with his weapons and armor. The other, who had a young son, is relieved of his sword, so that it might be taken back to his kin.\n\n\nAs for the five dead Normans, their bodies are thrown into a pile of thatch and then set alight.

To alleviate some of the tension, you dismount at the gates and offer your hand to Queen Dierdre. She stares at it for an uncomfortable moment, but then takes it and vaults elegantly off her steed. Side by side, you enter York together, flanked by a group of soldiers who are English and Irish in equal number.\n\n\nThe townspeople are still wary, a man hauling a bundle of wood goes so far as to wave a cross in the face of one of Dierdre\u0027s warriors, however your acceptance towards the Irish people has gone a long way to help smooth relations.\n\n\nLeaning against the thick wooden doors of the great hall stands your wife, and you quickly excuse yourself from Dierdre. Catheryn steps carefully, skirting the muddy patches on the ground, so as not to soil the flowing blue dress that she wears.

Next to your towering black warhorse Dierdre\u0027s orange pony seems almost childish, but when your own horse bares its teeth at Dierdre\u0027s, the shaggy pony merely raises its head haughtily, refusing to be cowed.\n\n\nYou notice with interest that although Dierdre\u0027s pony is fitted with a bridle it has no saddle, Dierdre, like the rest of her mounted escort, is riding bareback.\n\n\n\"Isn\u0027t that uncomfortable?\"\n\n\nShe laughs\n\n\n\"Not at all, and certainly not for the pony.

Acrid smoke from the campfires, piss and refuse from the latrines, sweat from the men.\n\n\nAnd fear. You smell that too.\n\n\nThese men have reason to be afraid. You have spent the last few months fighting King Harold\u0027s enemies, only to march double-time to confront his most dangerous yet; William of Normandy. His army is camped below, twelve thousand men strong, in comparison to your eight thousand. There is reason to be afraid. Are you afraid? No, you affirm decisively in your mind. You are not afraid. You are Lord Aethelwulf, The Lord In The North, King Harold\u0027s most trusted advisor, and the veteran of a hundred battles. Why should you be afraid of an army of ragtag Normans who come to die on your sword?\n\n\nShaking such doubts from your mind, you stride purposefully through the bustle of the camp, intent on checking on the forward defenses. A pair of giggling urchins weave nimbly around you and a staggering drunk lurches out in front of you, notices your sparkling chainmail armor and backs away, apologizing profusely. Striding onward towards the edge of the English camp you pass the watchful gaze of the sentries unchallenged and stand at the upper slope of the hill.\n\n\nYou are not alone. Another man sits on the hill, wreathed in the shadow of the setting sun. Drawing closer you recognize him as Acwellen, a minor lord, but stalwart fighter. His face is stone, his jaw grimly set and his eyes staring out at the horizon. Looking over his shoulder you see the black smoke smearing the red evening sky. In the distance the town of Hastings burns. In the blurry uncertainty of the setting sun, you cannot tell if the glisten at his eyes is tears or just the sparkle of dying sunlight. Acwellen\u0027s son, you remember, was put in command of Hasting\u0027s garrison.\n\n\nAbove the treeline you can just make out the crackle of flames. Hastings burns.\n","page 260":"You choose a strip of uninhabited coastline thirty-odd miles north of the Norman army\u0027s position. There your Anglo-Irish fleet disembarks, men cursing and spluttering as they plunge waist-deep into the frigid water of the winter sea.\n\n\nYou and your men travelled light, so your unloading is mercifully brief, and you and your soldiers spend most of the afternoon huddling next to a number of campfires that you have set up, trying futilely to dry your sand speckled clothes.\n\n\nThe moment the last of your items have been taken off of your captain\u0027s ship he casts off, eager to rid himself of the potential danger of associating with a rebel and a pirate. Dierdre\u0027s ships, on the other hand, sail back to Ireland with a skeleton crew, where they will remain until the majority of her army assembles.\n\n\nBy nightfall, all of Dierdre\u0027s ships have sailed out of sight and her men are all busy rigging tents and campfires. Having only the latter, you manage to persuade some of Dierdre\u0027s men to lend you some cloth so that you might set up a ragged lean-to for you and your soldiers.\n\n\nAs the inky darkness of night encroaches and the temperature begins to drop you prepare yourself for an uncomfortable and restless night.\n","page 262":"By the time you get yourself together the battle lines have already been drawn. On one side of a shallow river Dierdre has arranged her forces, with yours acting as protection for her left flank. Across the river and a hundred meters distant the Norman army waits cautiously, horsemen readying themselves to one side. You wet your lips, uncomfortably wishing you had taken a drink of something before you left\n\n\n\"Alright boys, you know the drill. Shields up, keep \u0027em up, protect your neighbor. Stay alive.\"\n\n\nThere is a murmur of acknowledgement. You feel sluggish in the chill of the morning air; there is no snow on the ground and the river is water, not ice, but it is cold nonetheless. You grip your short sword carefully, and for a terrible moment almost lose your grip; fingers numb with cold. You turn to Orvyn\n\n\n\"Are we getting old?\"\n\n\nHe smiles cheerlessly\n\n\n\"It\u0027s all a matter of comparison, I guess\"\n\n\nYou shrug, breath misting in the air\n\n\n\"I just can\u0027t help but think of all the people I\u0027ve known; King Harold, his two brothers, my father, so many people.

The Normans in front of your position are yelling and shoving at each other, half trying to form a solid line and the other half trying to retreat. Leaping, you swing your blade down at the Norman in front of you. He raises his kite shield awkwardly, but your strike combines the force of your blow with your own body weight and when the blade connects it shears straight through the kite shield, splintering the frame. The blade only stops when it becomes lodged in the Norman\u0027s shoulder. He screams horribly and falls into the frigid waters of the river, nearly dragging your sword in with him. Wrenching back, you free your sword from the Norman\u0027s flesh and press onward, parrying a spear thrust and leaving an opening for Garyn, who ducks in and drives his blade into the Norman soldier\u0027s gut, shattering the chainmail links.\n\n\nAll around you the Norman line is disintegrating, melting into confusion and chaos. Normans from further down the line are rushing to their comrades\u0027 support, but they soon find themselves under attack from Dierdre\u0027s Irish troops, who have followed your lead and are diving into the Norman forces, hacking them to pieces. Meanwhile your world has disappeared into a flurry of limbs, swords, and shields. Faces whirl around you, Normans and English, and Irish now too, all locked together in a crazed tangle. On the far side of the river, Normans are scrambling across the frigid mud on all fours, desperate to escape the killing behind them.\n\n\nThe water is so cold that it burns you, tongues of water lapping at your waist like arms of fire, simultaneously burning you and dragging you down. You scream encouragement, throat ragged and throbbing\n\n\n\"They\u0027re losing! They\u0027re losing! Break through to river bank! This day is ours!\"\n\n\nThe Irish who have now swelled your ranks likely have no idea what you said, but the understand the tone well enough and they add their voices to your cries, screaming and spitting in the faces of their terrified Norman adversaries. Having just cut another Norman soldier down, you step forward, and your foot presses into a muddy incline; you are nearing the edge of the river\n\n\n\"Keep pushing! We\u0027re nearly there!\"\n\n\nA Norman soldier shoves his spear at you, you slam your shield down and knock the shaft deep into the muck of the river. As he struggles to free the spear, you drive your sword into his throat. He falls mutely, and, just like that, you have broken through the Norman line. You search with an animal hunger for another enemy, but no one presents themselves. The Norman line has been broken, their soldiers have either fled or are dead in the red-soaked river. You feel like laughing.\n\n\nUntil you hear the horse hooves. You look up and see that the fifty Norman riders are charging your disorganized position.\n\n\n\"Form up!\"\n\n\nYou scream, and then scream it again\n\n\n\"Form up, you bastards! Form up! Now!\"\n\n\nHurriedly, your men stand beside you and lock shields. The Irish take a little longer, many have stayed behind to finish off the wounded Normans who line the riverbed. You turn briefly and see the Irish trudge slowly towards your line. You feel like screaming with wild exasperation. You wave at them with your sword\n\n\n\"Move, you idiots! Get up here! Now!\"\n\n\nWith slightly more hurry and a significant amount of indignation the Irish warriors slosh through the shallows of the river and take their positions along the length of your shieldline, bare skin steaming in the cold air. Satisfied, you turn to face the riders, who have closed most of the distance and are barreling down upon your position.\n\n\nYou face the man cantering towards you and realize with a sudden shock that he is riding Thunder, your horse. This gives you an idea, when the horsemen get close enough, an uncomfortable ten meters that shudders the ground at your feet, you scream at the top of your ragged lungs\n\n\n\"Thunder! Buck!\"\n\n\nRearing its head, the massive black warhorse flails its hoofs wildly, slamming into horses on either side. When the Norman riding him saws at the reigns desperately, Thunder whips his head around and bites his hand with his thick teeth, cracking bone. The charge disintegrates into a wild mess of horse hooves and broken long-spears.\n\n\nYour own horse has remained standing, and has managed to dislodge its temporary owner. Lips flared and teeth gnashing, it charges towards you, throwing up a spray of mud and muck as it comes to a halt beside you. The Irish warriors eye it warily, but you pat its cheek affectionately before hauling yourself into its saddle.\n\n\nMounted, you point your sword at the chaotic tangle of Norman riders\n\n\n\"Charge! Kill them all!\"\n\n\nIrish and English alike surge forwards in a wave of ferocity, though your men are careful to rescue their horses from the melee. You remain aloof of the fighting and once a suitable number of your party are mounted you point to the remaining soldiers of the retreating Norman infantry\n\n\n\"Form a circle around those men!\"\n\n\nYou flick at the reigns gently and Thunder leaps into action, galloping purposefully towards the exhausted troop of Normans. Once your men have made a loose circle around the force, you give the soldiers an ultimatum\n\n\n\"Normans! This battle is lost! Lay down your weapons, or die!\"\n\n\nIn the center of the harried Norman circle a tired looking soldier with blood down the front of his mailshirt, and clotted in his hair as well, holds up a blood soaked sword, and then drops it onto the dry ground below him. He croaks in rough English\n\n\n\"We surrender! Nous nous rendons!\"\n\n\nGaryn looks at you pointedly, but you shake your head\n\n\n\"Any Norman who drops their weapons may live! You have my word!\"\n\n\nThe tired Norman quickly relays your command in French and the other soldiers hastily drop their weapons and shields. You turn to your men and do a quick head count. Twenty four. That\u0027s everyone. You grin and raise your bloody sword into the air\n\n\n\"God loves us! This is a sign! He has chosen us, us to rule England!\"\n\n\nYou point your sword inland\n\n\n\"This is our land, our country! And we are going to take it back! Every! Last! Piece!\"\n\n\nYour men cheer, and Dierdre starts a victory cry amongst her warriors, and meanwhile you sit astride your warhorse and watch the burbling river behind you wash the blood of the Norman army downstream.\n","page 263":"The first charge is infantry, not cavalry. It seems that the Normans have learned from Hastings. The Norman soldiers advance quickly, conical helmets bobbing as they trot towards your line.\n\n\nAs they get closer, Dierdre\u0027s soldiers begin unleashing a salvo of slingstones and the occasional arrow. The Norman soldiers heft their thick blue kite shields, which cover most of their body, but (you note smugly) fail to overlap with their neighbors. Your own men have formed a solid wall of wood and iron; a pack of snarling wolf\u0027s heads.\n\n\nThe Norman force is larger, and more spread out, and so you watch cautiously for any sign that they might be trying to encircle you, however the river, which broadens at the end of your line, seems to be dissuading them from trying. Instead they march straight on, swords and spear tips glinting in the morning light.\n\n\nYour breath still mists the air, but you no longer feel cold. The excitement, the battle-fever, it builds up inside of you, a glowing mass in your chest that burns with restless energy.\n\n\nThe Norman force has reached the burbling river, and the men in the forefront pause briefly. The Irish have started a fearsome war chant that echoes across the open plain, some of them are so excited that they jump up and down on the spot, beating their slim shields with their weapons to accompany the cacophony of the war chant. So as not to feel left out, you start a shield chant with your men. You call out\n\n\n\"Who are we?\"\n\n\nOrvyn and Garyn answer\n\n\n\"Wolves!\"\n\n\n\"What do wolves do?\"\n\n\nAll of your men join in\n\n\n\"Kill! Kill! Kill!\"\n\n\nYou clatter your blade against the heavy wood of your round shield, and your men do likewise, and the noise adds to the Irish battle-clamor. You grip your sword, firmly but without clenching, and pick your target; a Norman with long black hair and a short spear. You keep your stance stable, digging your boots into the muddy grass of the embankment.\n\n\nThe Normans begin to cross the river, slowly and carefully, under a hail of slingstones and spears. Some of the Normans throw their own javelins, but the incline of the embankment makes many of the spears fall short of their targets. One of the projectiles strikes your shield, jarring your arm heavily. You curse\n\n\n\"Orvyn!\"\n\n\nHe nods obligingly and hacks the spear off of your shield deftly with his axe. Now the Normans are nearing the other side of the river, mailshirts glistening coldly with frigid water droplets. Some of them are visibly shaking, lips blue and shields held weakly. If ever there was a chance to turn the tide prematurely, it would be now.\n","page 288":"You nod to the high pillars of his hall, which are finely engraved and studded in silver\n\n\n\"Gold.

You curse and raise your shield, tucking your body closer against the rough stones of the castle wall. Beside you, puffing and grunting, two of your men hoist a rickety wooden ladder. Another arrow whips down, this one aimed at the two ladder-bearers. You catch it easily with your shield.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get that ladder up boys!\"\n\n\nOne of the ladder-bearers mutters something under his breath and you take a half-second to shoot him a withering glance, which he pretends not to notice.\n\n\nThis last month hasn\u0027t been easy, almost every day has been spent rallying, marching, and capturing castles such as this one. You, your men, and your Irish allies have worked in a frenzy of activity, taking castle after castle back from the Norman occupiers. This castle, you vow, will be next.\n\n\nAbove, you hear a ragged scratching and see that the teeth of the ladder have found purchase a foot below the crenellations of the wall. You couldn\u0027t have hoped for better placing. A Norman leans precariously over the wall to try and shove the ladder away, but a spear thrown by one of your men strikes him squarely in his shoulder. His body topples over and lands beside you, corpse crunching wetly as it strikes the hard ground. Hardly sparing him a glance, you grasp the wavering ladder firmly and proceed to climb, shield slung over your back for ease and protection.\n\n\nYou move up as fast as you can, hand over hand, hauling the enormous weight of your armored body steadily up the ladder\u0027s steep incline. The wall itself is only four meters high, but scaling it in full chainmail makes it feel like a mountain. Once you approach the top you draw your short sword and swing it haphazardly over the crenellations. Sure enough, you hear the heavy clatter of backpedalling footsteps and seize your opportunity, hoisting yourself over the stonework and dropping onto the wall\u0027s wooden platform.\n\n\nThree Normans turn to face you, one on your left, one on your right, and one teetering at the edge of the platform right in front of you. Moving before any of the enemy soldiers can react, you drop down and lash out with a steel-rimmed boot, catching the precarious Norman in the shin. He lets out a sharp yelp and plunges backwards into the keep, arms pin-wheeling uselessly. The Norman on your left moves to strike, but he is knocked off balance by a javelin which bites into the wood of his shield. You move as though to strike at him, but then twist and backswing your longsword into the face of the unsuspecting Norman at your right. The blade cracks the man\u0027s jawbone roughly, his mouth opens and spills thick blood. You tear the sword free and face your original target, who has recovered his position and faces you cautiously, kite shield held high. Unfortunately for him this restricts his view and so when one of your men clambers up the spindly wooden ladder the Norman doesn\u0027t see him until it is too late. His scream is short and ugly, cut off as your warrior drives his sword even deeper into the Norman\u0027s throat.\n\n\nHoisting your shield, you tear off towards the raised hulk of the gatehouse, boots clacking heavily against the warped wooden platform. Across the wall more ladders are being raised and more of your warriors (as well as more than a few Irish) rally behind you, quickly overcoming anyone blocking your path.\n\n\nYou take the descending stairs two at a time, vaulting carelessly and almost getting yourself impaled on the end of a Norman spear. Using your elevated position to your advantage, you twist and slam your boot squarely into the man\u0027s chest, knocking him off the stairs and into the mud and filth below. Stepping over him, you sprint to the heavy wooden gate, ensconced by a frame of thick stone.\n\n\nSix Norman soldiers are working furiously, shoving heavy pieces of timber in place to prop up the doors, which are being battered relentlessly by your outside forces. Your sword works with a deadly malice and two of the Normans are dead before any of them realize they are under attack. Turning, the exhausted Normans try to mount a defense and are quickly cut down, falling amidst the piles of timber.\n\n\nYour men quickly work to clear away the debris at the gate, and two burly Irishmen heave at the huge wooden bar that keeps the gate shut. While they work you and three other men guard their backs. The Normans are attacking with a vengeance, arrows buzz like angry hornets, hammering into your shield and killing the man on your left. Soldiers, blue kite shields raised, storm your position, at least two dozen strong.\n\n\nYou heft your sword confidently, feet dug firmly into the wet soil beneath you. So long as you strength left in your sword arm and a battle cry left in your lungs you vow not to take a single step backwards.\n\n\nYou don\u0027t have to.\n\n\nBehind you the gates crash open and your soldiers spill forth like an angry gale, crashing into the Norman defenders. As you stand still, more and more warriors pass by you, jostling to capture the Norman castle. You breath a silent sigh of relief.\n\n\nAlthough pockets of resistance still no doubt remain, the battle has been won. You wipe your sword clean with a swath of cloth tied to your belt. All that\u0027s left now is to secure the castle and establish a garrison. Then you can head home. You slide your short sword back into its sheath and think to yourself smugly; all in a good day\u0027s work.\n","page 279":"You increase the pressure, feeling his knuckles buckle under the force of your iron grip. Lord Ryce makes no sound of discomfort, but his complexion whitens somewhat and his diagonal line of a mouth is beginning to curve slightly into a grimace.\n\n\nYou release his hand with a smirk and he pulls back quickly, his eyes filled with malice.

The chain links are weak there and they burst easily, your sword slips silently into his body. You grin, and speak through panting breaths\n\n\n\"Like I said, this old wolf still has some teeth\"\n\n\nHe opens his mouth, and blood bubbles out. The corners of his mouth turn upwards in a shaky grin. Your gut churns, but not from fear. Looking down you see the blossom of red flowing down your torso.

You don\u0027t care. It was fatal before; it can only be more fatal now. You have just one last goal.\n\n\nGripping the hilt of your sword, you drag it free from his body with a heavy sucking noise.

You lean over to Dierdre\n\n\n\"Are you sure you don\u0027t want a helmet?\"\n\n\nHer thick orange hair is like burnished copper in the darkness. She shows the whites of her teeth\n\n\n\"Thanks, but no thanks. I can fight perfectly fine without a metal bucket on my head\"\n\n\nYou shrug, adjusting the straps of your own helmet\n\n\n\"Suit yourself\"\n\n\nBehind you, more soldiers are joining your shieldline, forming fresh rows to replace the men who will inevitably fall. Your band advances slowly up the London Bridge, feet scuffing the smooth stones. The Norman force waits ahead, an immobile line of spears.\n\n\nYou heft your short sword, gripping it with just the right amount of pressure. The blade is heavy, but in your deft fingers it moves with lithe efficiency. You count the paces left in front of you: fifteen, maybe twenty. The Norman kite shields lie in wait, a solid barrier to block your progress. For now, there are only sixty of them, but soon there could be more.\n\n\nYou quicken your pace; the skirt of your mailshirt shivers metallically. Under your increased pace the distance is eaten away, and when there are only a few paces left the Normans thrust their spears forward and close the gap. The spear in front of you flicks forward and jams into your shield, your forward momentum snaps the head. The splintered spearshaft, still pushing forward, slides off your shield and narrowly misses Dierdre, instead stabbing into someone standing behind you.\n\n\nYou ignore the wood shaft and sprint forward, and your shieldline sprints forward behind you, moving like a wave. With a tremendous crash of wood on wood and steel on steel, your shieldwall is joined with the Normans. Then comes the chaos.\n\n\nThe Normans in the front ranks wield spears, and this makes them cumbersome in close combat. You hack and cut wildly, blade sinking indiscriminately into shieldwood and flesh. Under your determined onslaught the Normans break ranks and your own shieldline surges into the gap, cutting down the Norman spear-bearers as they stumble.\n\n\nYou step over the corspes of the Norman dead and dying and press forward, ready to face the next line of Normans. These ones are carrying swords, and they fight fiercely, checking your line\u0027s advance. Beside you, Dierdre parries a sword-thrust and you drive your blade into the thigh of her attacker. As he staggers sideways she thrusts her sword into his throat.\n\n\nA sword flashes towards you, a glimmer of light in the darkness. You catch the blow on your shield, feeling the might of the impact shudder down your arm. Twisting the shield, you move forward and ram the bottom of the shield into your opponent\u0027s hand. He cries out and drops his sword, as he fumbles you drive your shield forward and smash it into his face. His high conical helmet and nose-guard protect his eyes and nose, but the metal boss of your shield pulverizes his mouth. His eyes widen as he spits blood and broken teeth. Unchallenged, your blade drives upward into his stomach, shattering his mailshirt and piercing his gut. The hot steam of his entrails wafts through the night air.\n\n\nYou shove the dying Norman aside and continue your relentless advance forward. The next three ranks of Normans fall to your line in similar fashion, in the tight confines of the bridge; their large kite shields are a burden. You are spattered in blood, hot and sticky.\n\n\nAhead of you, the Normans have reformed into a new defensive line. You prepare to meet them, when suddenly the Norman shields shift at the center, allowing the exit of one man. He is tall, perhaps even taller than you. He wears a fine mailshirt and helmet, but carries no shield. Instead, he wields a two-handed mace. The weapon is primarily wooden, but the end has been laced with metal points.\n\n\nBy the way he holds the mace, passing it easily from hand to hand, you can tell that it is a well balanced. Flowing out from under his helmet is the man\u0027s hair, which is blond like yours, yet unlike yours his still sparkles with the vivaciousness of youth. It is hard to tell the man\u0027s age, but you place it at mid twenties. Old enough to have battle experience, but young enough to still have the energy of youth.\n\n\nWhatever his age, this man is clearly a competent warrior. He smiles, and his teeth shine in the darkness. He speaks in English that is accented, but still understandable\n\n\n\"I sought you out on the field at Hastings, Lord Aethelwulf\"\n\n\nYou hold your sword carefully\n\n\n\"Luckily for you, our meeting was delayed\"\n\n\nHe ignores you\n\n\n\"From what I hear, you were a great warrior. Once. But look at you now; old and pathetic\"\n\n\nYou grit your teeth, your lips peel back in a snarl. The Norman grins\n\n\n\"Your time as a leader of armies is over. I know it. You know it.\"\n\n\nHe waves his mace at the men behind you\n\n\n\"Your own troops certainly know it! After all, it was under your leadership that York got destroyed-\"\n\n\nDierdre calls out at you to stop, but you are already lunging forward. The Norman\u0027s smile hardens into a grimace of determination and he leaps forward to meet your advance.\n\n\nHere, in the center of the bridge, between the English forces and the Normans, you engage in a duel with the young warrior. Your sword moves like a serpent, twisting and slashing. The Norman parries with ease, using his long mace as both a sword and a spear.\n\n\nWhen he begins striking back he delivers his blows with tremendous force, and your shield shudders under the onslaught. Every blow from the club that hits your shield sends a stabbing pain up your arm. You press your boots more firmly into the bridge\u0027s flagstones; slowly, inexorably, he is pushing you back.\n\n\nDetermined, you redouble your efforts and succeed in holding your ground, but this counter attack has left you winded, while the Norman seems unperturbed. He smiles at you\n\n\n\"You\u0027re getting old, wolf. Accept your fate.

About seventy archers, and half that many slingers, most of them Irish, step forward. Dierdre raises her hand and calls out in Gaelic. All the Irish archers nock arrows to their bowstrings, and your English-speaking archers copy their movements.\n\n\nShe gives another command and the Irish archers raise their bows and pull their bowstrings back. Your archers follow suit. Meanwhile, the slingers have fitted stones into their pouches and have begun to whirl the cords, creating a loud humming buzz.\n\n\nThen comes the command to loose, and all forces fire at once. The slingers let their slingstones fly, and they whistle through the air. The archers release their bowstrings and the arrows fly free with cracking retorts.\n\n\nThe projectiles hammer into the Norman line, striking like a deadly hail. Yet, the Normans do not falter. Their shields, though more cumbersome then your own, are larger, and protect more of the body. They have been designed for repelling ranged attacks, and they serve their purpose well. The arrows drive into the shields, burying deep but not piercing through. The slingstones ram into the wood, ricocheting off violently and chipping the paint.\n\n\nYour army has loosed more than a hundred projectiles, and killed perhaps three Normans. You curse angrily, and wave at the assembled group of archers and slingers\n\n\n\"Again! Again!\"\n\n\nThe archers nock new arrows. The slingers fit new stones. Bows are raised and cords are whirled. Then-\n\n\nDierdre drags you to the ground, and you try to rise but she presses hard on your shoulder. Her other arm holds a shield, it is held above you both.\n\n\nShe is screaming in both English and Gaelic, but you aren\u0027t listening. You are staring across the London Bridge, atop the walls of London itself. The walls appear to be lit by a hundred different fireflies, all twinkling in the darkness.\n\n\nThere is a leathery snap, and then that familiar hissing sound, and the fireflies depart, leaping off the walls of London and arcing over the bridge towards your army. You watch the swarm of fireflies numbly. Fire arrows.\n\n\nThe Normans on the bridge had thick kite shields to protect them. Your archers have no such defense. The arrows blaze through the sky and rain down upon your army. An arrow lands beside you and when it hits the cobblestones it erupts in orange sparks. Several land on your arm and you brush them off delicately.\n\n\nMost of the arrows find their mark and die quietly, extinguishing themselves with a soft hiss as they bury themselves in their victim\u0027s body. Others burn brighter still, catching on an oily piece of clothing, or hair. In those cases the person is transformed into a human torch, and their screams form a cacophony that rings in your ears.\n\n\nThe next volley of arrows comes soon after. These arrows are normal, unlit, and in the night sky they are invisible. There is only the noise of their flight, and then the noise of their impact. Arrows thud into shield-wood. Arrows drive into flesh. There is more screaming, and your army is disintergrating, melting back into the safety of the alleyways.\n\n\nYou hold your shield up and follow your army in its retreat, stepping over arrow-riddled bodies as you go.\n\n\n\"Come on Dierdre, let\u0027s get the hell out of here-\"\n\n\nDierdre is no longer standing beside you. Backtracking hurriedly in the darkness, you move back towards where you were standing. You hear the hiss of more arrows and raise your shield, the wood is so chipped and splintered that it is beginning to fall apart.\n\n\nThe arrows land, they clatter against the cobblestones, sink into the corpses, and slam into your shield. One passes close to your leg, you feel its arrow feathers trace across your calf.\n\n\nYou find Dierdre almost in the same spot where you left her. She is lying down, but is miraculously still alive. There is an arrow embedded deep in her lower leg, in the darkness the blood that oozes from the wound appears black. She looks up at you with a tired, pained expression\n\n\n\"Just leave me-\"\n\n\nYou cut her off, looping an arm around her waist and hauling her up\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t be stupid. Come on, just lean on me\"\n\n\nDierdre grits her teeth and begins hobbling forward, leaning heavily against your body for support. You can see the desperation written in the hard lines on her face, and the desperation fuels her. Ahead of you, just ten paces, is the safety of the buildings.\n\n\nBehind you, you hear the next volley of arrows being launched. Dierdre grimaces\n\n\n\"Oh god, not now\"\n\n\nYou ignore her and shift your shield, slinging it over your back. The shield is splintered and cracked, but hopefully it will still be large enough for you and Dierdre both.\n\n\nThe arrows are closing in, the whistling noise blurring into one high whine. You brace for an impact, and sure enough you feel something slam into the shield on your back, as though someone had kicked you there, hard. You fall and bring Dierdre down with you, but she manages to hold out her arms in time and lands on all fours, injured leg shaking from the strain.\n\n\nYou laugh\n\n\n\"Good thing I thought to put the shield on my back, right?\"\n\n\nDierdre says nothing, only stares at you. You ignore her and begin pushing yourself up from the ground, but to your shock you find that you cannot. You heave with all your might, but your arms seem suddenly incapable of holding your weight.\n\n\nIt is only when you stop moving for a moment that you realize your legs can no longer move. There is also a strange feeling in the small of your back, a coldness that is spreading up and down your body.\n\n\nYou swallow painfully\n\n\n\"Dierdre-\"\n\n\nShe snaps into action\n\n\n\"Just stay still- Oh christ... Maybe if I-\"\n\n\nYou can feel the blood now, hot and thick, bubbling up and out from the hole made by the arrow that has driven itself into your lower back. You can feel its presence; sense the sharp arrowhead pressing up against your spine, maybe even piercing it...\n\n\nDierdre is still talking, but you have made up your mind\n\n\n\"Dierdre. Go. Now!\"\n\n\nYou hear the arrows being loosed from the walls of London. There is no time.\n\n\nFrom your position, you reach out and give her a weak shove. She stumbles forward, clutching her injured leg. As she hobbles towards safety, she looks back at you one last time...\n","page 877":"With the Frisians taken care of and the bodies of the dead being burned, you decide to get your army prepped for the next fight.\n\n\nAs you walk through the camp your men, as well as those in yellow livery, make way and await your commands.

Men holding pitchforks are cut down, women clutching screaming infants are eviscerated, children are trampled under heavy horse hooves.\n\n\nDrawing your sword, you prepare to rush to the fyrd\u0027s aide, when suddenly you notice something; there is a second Norman force approaching. Dierdre\u0027s troops, unfortunately positioned in a dip in the road, are unable to clearly observe their surroundings, but notice the fire and chaos in front of them and rush in to help.\n\n\nIn their hurry to provide assistance, none think to look behind them.

In the indistinct dusk lighting everyone is wreathed in blackness, the only faces lit up are the ones close to the fires that blaze across the road. Their flickering light illuminates the Norman horsemen and you watch helplessly as their swords flash; up and down, up and down, spraying red.\n\n\nYou wish you could help, but it is of utmost importance that the Irish army is alerted to the enemies behind them.\n\n\nHardening your heart, you drive Thunder past the slaughter, towards the Irish forces.\n","page 671":"You and Dierdre stand once more in the light of the morning sun.

You work with a spare piece of cloth, struggling to remove burnt and clotted blood from the edge of your sword blade. The camp holds an overpowering scent of smoke and char, and your lungs are pained from coughing. Irritably, you kick at your boot heels, which are still soggy from the swamp ambush.\n\n\nYour attention is drawn momentarily away from your sword by a number of raised voices. Looking up, you see that Garyn and Mance are dragging a captured Norman across the ground towards you. You stand up\n\n\n\"I already told you, we\u0027re letting all the prisoners go!

The Norman\u0027s smile shrinks slightly.\n\n\n\"Have it your way then\"\n\n\nHe advances carefully, boots clicking against the flagstones. You keep your shield half raised, ready to intercept his first blow. As he gets closer, you keep an eye on his feet. Sure enough, they betray him. His leading foot begins to slide forward, a fraction of a second before his arm follows to begin the strike.\n\n\nHaving anticipated his move, you clip his mace with your shield and knock it out of your way. As he reels back you heave your blade forward in a sweeping diagonal cut. The Norman is swift, but your blade still manages to scrape against his chainmail.\n\n\nSurprised, he backs off a few paces and places a hand on his chest, feeling the dented mail-links on his torso. You grin\n\n\n\"Try it again, Norman, and see what happens\"\n\n\nHe smiles back innocently, but his eyes sparkle with anger. You, the \u0027old man\u0027, have landed the first blow, and to him this is unacceptable.\n\n\nLaunching himself forward, the Norman delivers a salvo of blows, most of which you deflect with your shield, which is slowly becoming more and more splintered.\n\n\nYet, though your shield is battered and your arm is sore, you still remain unscathed, and when the young Norman raises his mace for another blow, you find an opening in his defense and drive the point of your sword into his thigh. He cries out and falls back, clutching his calf. You smile tiredly\n\n\n\"First blood, Norman. Had enough?\"\n\n\nThe Norman grips his calf, face red with pain. He curses at you in French-\n\n\nThen he whips his mace at you.\n\n\nThe motion takes you completely by surprise. You try to leap out of the way, but you are too slow. Maybe ten years ago you could have, but you are not the man you once were.\n\n\nThe mace cracks against your shin, something snaps, and you fall to your knees. The pain is excruciating, but you let no sound of pain escape your lips. You will die as a warrior.\n\n\nThe next blow from the mace drives into your chin and snaps your neck.\n","page 892":"You leap up and draw your sword, tossing your cloak in a crumpled heap.\n\n\n\"Archers! Three volleys!\"\n\n\nYour archers stand, each one nocking an arrow. Unlike most arrows, which end in lethal iron points, these are special. Each one is wrapped in cloth, and the cloth has been dipped in a thick coating of black pitch. Someone passes a torch around, and the arrow tips flare into life, coughing smoke and spitting sparks. Satisfied, you turn to your infantry\n\n\n\"On me! Charge! Charge! Charge!\"\n\n\nWithout another glance you take off at a sprint, and your men hurry to follow. As you run you hear the first volley launch with a twang and a whoosh. The arrows cut through the air overhead, leaving long tongues of fire in their wake. Through the trees and bushes, you see that Mance\u0027s army is also firing their burning arrows. Soon, the Norman camp will be a fiery chaos.\n\n\nAs your boots begin to taste firm earth, leaving behind the soggy mud of the swamp, the second volley spits overhead. The Norman camp is a flurry of activity. The flaming arrows have struck indiscriminately, setting fire to tents, wagons, horses, and people. The second volley further ignites the mess, and the camp is now a place of madness and fire.\n\n\nAs your sprint carries you into the long grass on the outskirts of the camp, the third and final volley flies perilously overhead. You raise your sword high\n\n\n\"Onward! Onward!\"\n\n\nYou strike a terrified Norman in the neck with your sword, and the blood that gushes forth sizzles and foams as it spatters against a burning wooden cart. Another Norman, this one wearing only a pair of tattered breeches charges at you with a spear. You parry his blow easily and disembowel him, kicking his limp body into a burning tent. He writhes and screams as the flames caress his body, and then he falls quiet.\n\n\nGaryn vents his anger with violent, sweeping sword strokes, hacking his enemies to pieces and butchering their remains. The fire that burns around him is reflected in his eyes, and he fights with demonic passion. Orvyn works alongside him, wielding his brutal axe with deftness and precision.\n\n\nMoving along the paths that are clear of fire, your forces cut through the Norman camp, moving inexorable towards the fiery center. On the other side, Mance\u0027s group performs the same task.\n\n\nThe Normans are caught between two pincers and a fire in the middle. For them, there is only death.\n","page 411":"You pray for the forgiveness of both God and your own people.\n\n\n\"Dierdre! Wait!\"\n\n\nShe turns expectantly.

Atop the London walls, backlit by light from within the city, you see the shadowy figures of Normans. They shout and yell, and alarm bells begin to sound, but it no longer matters; you have already made it across the bridge.\n\n\nYour feet transfer from the firm stones of the bridge to the gritty muck of the dirt. Three more strides and you step into the protective shadow of a nearby shack.\n\n\nYou press onward and your army follows, spreading out and taking shelter between the ramshackle houses that populate the surrounding area. The houses are made from mud, wood, and thatch, and they are your way into London. Made by the poor and the destitute, the houses lean up against each other for support.

It rears up, forming an abrupt dead end to the alleyway that you have been running down. On either side of the alleyway, the final two houses of the street have been built right into the stone walls, their mud plaster slathered against the rough stones. You have found your climbing ladders.\n\n\nBeside you, Dierdre grins and points the building on the left.\n","page 895":"As York draws close, you ride ahead with the other outriders, and you breathe a sigh of relief when you find it quiet. There are no raging fires, no hulking siege weapons, and no bustle of an attacking army. You have gotten there first. York is safe.

After being on the road for so long, the thought of resting beside the security of thick stone walls is comforting to all.\n\n\nAs you maneuver your horse through the outer town streets, you begin to feel your unease grow anew. The town is blanketed in a grim silence, and you see few townspeople. Those who you do see quickly scurry into the safety of their homes, some without even raising a hand in acknowledgement. Flanked by your outriders, you spur your horse onwards, up the streets towards the high stone walls of York\u0027s fort.\n\n\nWhen you reach the gate, you find it closed to your approach. You look to the other outriders, most of whom are warriors from your household, and they all shake their heads in equal disbelief and concern. Atop the wall, two sentries stand impassively.

Whose orders! I am your lord, and I command you-\"\n\n\n\"I gave them their orders, lord Aethelwulf\"\n\n\nYou recognize the voice without looking up; the speaker is Bishop Wilfrid. You gnash your teeth with ill-suppressed rage. You refuse to even look at him, but when you do raise your head your anger is momentarily replaced with heart-hammering fear. Catheryn is standing beside Wilfrid, who is holding her gently but firmly by her arm. In his other arm he holds a heavy knife.\n\n\nYour hand is shaking, so you steady it against the hilt of your sword.

Camp followers come in all flavors, in your opinion most are leeches, but some can be useful. Some bring food and water to trade; others bring herbs and other medicinal products. Although occasionally camp followers will join in a battle, it is usually only after it has been decisively won.

See?\"\n\n\nShe taps the girl\u0027s chin and she opens her mouth obligingly. Looking inside her mouth you see that, in place of her tongue, there remains only a cauterized stub. You shudder, and the girl stares idly back at you. Dierdre yawns, sticking out her tongue mockingly. If the girl is offended, she hides it well\n\n\n\"Anyways, as I said, the girl can\u0027t talk. Her tongue was cut out for witchcraft\"\n\n\nYou feel a chill at your spine, and your hand reaches for the cross, which, you realize belatedly, is not currently hanging at your neck\n\n\n\"Witchcraft?\"\n\n\nDierdre nods seriously\n\n\n\"This girl is a powerful woodswitch; she can conjure devious potions\"\n\n\nYour eyes flick back to the girl and she gives you an icy smile\n\n\n\"What does this have to do with the Norman army?\"\n\n\nDierdre leans in\n\n\n\"Disguised as a camp follower, this girl can slip into the Norman encampment and poison their foodstuffs.

Bishop Wilfrid shakes his head\n\n\n\"You may be York\u0027s lord, but I am York\u0027s Bishop. You can command their loyalties, but I have command over their very souls!\"\n\n\nThe Bishop is working himself into a frenzy now; his speech is thick and slurred\n\n\n\"You have never been a man of the people! You have never been knowledgeable to their best interests! All you care about is your war, and your killing, and you don\u0027t care how many people get hurt along the way! I know what\u0027s best for the people! We must work with the Normans, for stability\u0027s sake!

During his rant, Wildrid\u0027s grip on Catheryn had loosened considerably, allowing her to twist free and strike the old man in his chest. As he staggers back she makes a lunge for his knife, and the two grapple with the blade.\n\n\nThe two sentries both watch open-mouthed, but neither moves to help. Your heart is in your mouth. You can only watch. Wilfrid tears free from Catheryn\u0027s grip and manages to slash her across her arm, cutting a thin red line below her shoulder. Your breath hitches sharply. Catheryn winces, but doesn\u0027t back down.\n\n\nInstead, she makes a second dive for the blade and when Wilfrid swings the knife at her she leaps out of the way and kicks him in his side. The old man drops back, wheezing, and as his grip slackens she snatches the knife from his hand. Stepping back in fear, he holds his hands out\n\n\n\"Please-\"\n\n\nCatheryn plunges the knife into his chest. Bishop Wilfrid dissolves into a coughing fit, doubling over. Each cough comes thicker than the last as his lungs fill with blood. His teeth, stained red, mouth empty words, but no one can hear him. He collapses against the crenellations and lies silent, one scrawny arm drooping over the wall.\n\n\nCatheryn, spattered in blood and bleeding from a wound on her upper arm, pulls the knife free and turns to face the two sentries\n\n\n\"Unlock the gate and let in my husband. At once.\"\n\n\nThe two guards hurry to comply. With his death at the hands of your wife, the spell of Bishop Wilfrid has been broken.\n","page 415":"You take a deep breath and keep walking.

Before long, patches of sand begin to peek through the water\u0027s haze, no more than a few meters down.\n\n\nWhen the keel drives into the thick sand, the shuddering force catches you by surprise and you wrap your arms awkwardly around the boat\u0027s tall prow. Behind you, one of the sailors snickers and you shoot him a venomous glare. Caught, his face reddens and he mumbles a half-hearted apology. You ignore him and leap over the ship\u0027s side, splashing into frigid waist deep water. Soon after, Garyn leaps in beside you \"Christ, that\u0027s cold!\" Onboard the ship, a sailor (the same sailor who insulted you) laughs \"Balls getting cold, eh?\" In a flash, Garyn leaps up and grabs the sailor by the front of his woolen shirt, yanking him back into the water with an enormous splash. Everyone, your men and sailors alike, roar with laughter. The dunked sailor resurfaces, coughing and sputtering.\n\n\nStill laughing, your men and the sailors hop off the boat one by one, arranging themselves evenly on either side. At a command from the captain, who stands chest deep in water at the stern of the ship, everyone heaves forward. You push with all your strength, the muscles on your back screaming. Slowly, the mass of wood and pitch is dragged onto dry land.\n\n\nOnce a full third of the ship is dragged past the tideline, the captain calls a halt.\n\n\nExhausted, you fall onto the wet sand. The sun is sparkling in your eyes, but you feel to tired to block it with your arm. Suddenly, the light goes out; Orvyn is standing in front of you, extending a hand\n\n\n\"We\u0027ve got company\"\n\n\nYou take his hand and he hauls you to your feet.\n\n\nStanding under the shadow of a stumpy old fir tree whose roots dig into the sand, two cloaked men wait patiently. Under their cloaks, both men are bare-chested, and both sport swirling tattoos etched across their bodies. The one on the left carries a spear and the one on the right carries an axe, but neither weapon is held threateningly. They merely watch passively, waiting.\n\n\nOrvyn breaks the silence, he calls to them in the eerie Gaelic tongue, to which the man on the left responds in kind. Orvyn then speaks quicker, pointing to you and your men. The spear-carrying man nods curtly. Satisfied, Orvyn turn to you\n\n\n\"These men are enforcers for Queen Dierdre. Usually they would impose a toll, but I told them we wanted a meeting with her, and they have agreed to take us to her fortress\"\n\n\nYou clap Orvyn on the shoulder\n\n\n\"Good work. Now let\u0027s meet the Queen\"\n\n\nYou move to follow the two Irishmen, but remember that you haven\u0027t paid the second half of the captain\u0027s fee. Drawing five pieces of hacksilver from a pouch at your belt, you toss the glittering shards of metal to the captain. He pockets the money eagerly and half-turns towards his ship, but then faces you again\n\n\n\"Are you lot working for Lord Aethelwulf?\"\n","page 207":"After the incident with Garyn and Orvyn, the storm begins to subside. Slowly, the waves lessen in height and the deep black clouds begin to break apart, exposing rays of pure warm light, which fall mercifully on your cold soaking bodies.\n\n\nOnce the storm clouds dissipate enough, the captain allows for the tattered sail to be raised and, once it is locked in place, everyone gains a well-earned rest. You keep watch at the ship\u0027s front, leaning against the raised wooden prow.\n\n\nIn the distance, the green, fogged-wrapped island of Ireland begins to take shape. The ship\u0027s prow noses forward, scenting for land.\n","page 449":"The fight up the hill is hard.\n\n\nInstead of charging into your shieldwall with their horses, the Norman riders have dismounted and stand shoulder to shoulder with the infantry. The hillside itself is a wicked mess; the Normans have placed stakes along the path, which break up the cohesiveness of your shieldwall. They have also dug small pitfalls, no deeper than a hands-depth, but deadly all the same. Because your shield is raised high you cannot always see what is at your feet, and you have so far stepped into three of the little pitfalls. On the last one you barely managed to recover your balance, and when you did you could hear the bones in your ankle grind together painfully.\n\n\nIn addition to the pitfalls and the stakes the Normans are launching a hail of arrows, and because of the angle, your own skirmishers are powerless to retaliate.\n\n\nThe Normans, it seems, have learned since the battle of Hastings. \n","page 209":"You take a step forward, using your extra few inches of height to overshadow the ship captain\n\n\n\"I am Lord Aethelwulf\"\n\n\nThe captain blanches; he drops to one knee, coating his grimy pant leg in thick wet sand.\n\n\n\"My lord!\"\n\n\nYou wave for one of your soldiers to help the older man to his feet\n\n\n\"It\u0027s good to hear that the name Aethelwulf still means something\"\n\n\nThe ship captain nods vigorously\n\n\n\"Yes lord, men all across England speak of your victories\"\n\n\nHe watches you carefully\n\n\n\"Ireland is a long way from home, isn\u0027t it, my lord?\"\n\n\nYou stare him down coldly\n\n\n\"Trade negotiations\"\n\n\nThe captain raises an eyebrow quizzically, staring at the heap of swords and chainmail that your men are unloading from his ship\n\n\n\"Trade negotiations?\"\n\n\nYou nod firmly\n\n\n\"That\u0027s what I said. We want to establish trade with Queen Dierdre\"\n\n\nThe captain looks like he wants to say more, but in the end just shakes his head and turns back to his ship.\n\n\nYou now turn your attention to the two waiting Irishmen, who beckon for you to follow.\n","page 451":"Once the Irish reached the top of the hill, the battle was won. Falling upon the Norman soldiers like a whirlwind of fury, the Irish warriors were an unstoppable force. Some of the Normans tried to surrender, falling to their knees and discarding their weapons, but the Irish killed them anyway.\n\n\nNow, a few hours later, you lean against an overturned cart in the Norman camp; boots coated in mud and congealed blood. The bodies of your dead are being buried in a grove north of the hillside. Your own loses have been slight, only fifteen men. The same cannot be said for Dierdre\u0027s Eriu; taking the hill has cost them dearly, nearly two hundred of her warriors are dead. The Erius\u0027 suffering pales in comparison to that of the Normans; of the original complement of nearly two thousand almost all are dead, executed by the enraged Irish. To your left, the night sky is lit by a massive bonfire, which feeds on the corpses of the Norman army. The smell of burning flesh mingles with the iron tang of spilt blood.\n\n\nThe commonfolk, at least, are happy. Despite their losses climbing the hill, their numbers have swollen from the number of camp followers who have now joined your army. Reeling at the taste of victory, their spirits are high and everywhere you go men raise ale cups in toasts to your honor.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAs the moon rises into the cold night sky, you catch the occasional glimpse of a raven reflected in the moonlight.

You and your soldiers fare well, though your shields are all bit to splinters and heavy with arrows. The Irish, despite their bravery, are dying. Their light armor; usually an advantage that allowed them to move quickly in close combat is now leaving them perilously vulnerable to the incoming arrow volleys. The commonfolk, too, are wavering.\n\n\nYou have to get to the top of the hill. Pausing to hack the arrows off of your shield, you raise both your sword and your voice\n\n\n\"Charge! Get to the top of the hill! Kill them all!\"\n\n\nYou leap forward, and your warriors are quick to follow. The shieldwall disintegrates as everyone bounds up the hill as fast as their aching legs can carry them. The lancing shafts of arrows cut swathes into your front rank, and men break their ankles stepping into the hidden pitfalls, yet still your army advances.\n\n\nAn arrow, fired only a few meters away drives so deep into your shield that the arrowhead breaks through and shatters the mail rings on your forearm, burying itself into your flesh.\n\n\nYou barely feel it. All you feel is the battle-rage, the sword-song, which rings in your ears and guides your blade as it carves into the front rank of the Norman line.\n\n\nYou and your forces have reached the top of the hill, and the slaughter has begun.\n","page 431":"You pray for the forgiveness of both God and your own people.\n\n\n\"Lord Ryce!

Camp followers come in all flavors, in your opinion most are leeches, but some can be useful. Some bring food and water to trade; others bring herbs and other medicinal products. Although occasionally camp followers will join in a battle, it is usually only after it has been decisively won. A thousand is still no small number, but the realization that it is not two thousand has certainly brightened your mood.\n\n\n\"So then, what\u0027s the plan?\"\n\n\nRyce searches idly for nonexistent dirt under his fingers, then dismounts to face you\n\n\n\"Their army seems in no hurry to move, doubtless they\u0027re waiting for us\"\n\n\nYou nod carefully\n\n\n\"Do you think we could bait them out?\"\n\n\nLord Ryce shrugs\n\n\n\"Maybe, but I think I have a better idea\"\n\n\nHe twists around and calls out in the bizarre dialect of the Frisians. A few moments later he is joined by a slight Frisian man wrapped in a thick brown woolen cloak. You incline your head politely, but the man only stares at you with blue eyes the color of icy slush. Lord Ryce chuckles lightly\n\n\n\"He can\u0027t talk. See?\"\n\n\nHe taps the man\u0027s chin, which is covered by the weak beginnings of a beard, and he opens his mouth obligingly. Looking inside his mouth you see that, in place of a tongue, there remains only a cauterized stub. You shudder, and the man stares idly back at you. Lord Ryce shrugs nonchalantly\n\n\n\"Anyways, as I said, the man can\u0027t talk.

Nudging your horse forward you catch the spear-carrier off guard and slash your sword across his thigh, drawing a thin line of blood. He shrieks in pain and a woman carrying a long wood axe heaves with all her might, slamming the heavy axe head into the Norman\u0027s shoulder. The Norman carrying the spear is mortally wounded, one of his arms remains attached only by the slightest scrap of sinew, but the torchbearer still lives.\n\n\nUsing his long flaming stick he parries desperately, drawing long tongues of flame across the air around him.

Dierdre shifts her weight from one foot to the other\n\n\n\"You done yet?\"\n\n\nYou regain your position stiffly, hefting your long sword with an arm that aches and feels lead-heavy. As an afterthought, you loosen the straps of your battered round-shield quickly and drop it to the sand at your feet.\n\n\n\"Oh yes, Dierdre. I am done.\"\n\n\nYou leap forward, every muscle working in a concerted effort. Dierdre parries your first blow, but you follow up with a second, and then a third, and then a fourth, each blow crashing into Dierdre\u0027s blade, which is now flecked with indentations. Dierdre keeps on backing up, and although her poise is still excellent and her resolve remains unwavering, she is no longer smiling. For the first time since this fight began, Dierdre has to concentrate.\n\n\nYour arms feel waterlogged and deadened, but you ignore the sensation and press your attack doggedly onwards. You strike again, and Dierdre parries, and again, and Dierdre parries, and again, and-\n\n\nYour long sword crunches into her blade, shearing it in half.\n\n\nPerhaps, just perhaps, you can win this fight. Yet in that same instant you realize that you cannot. The unexpected lack of resistance to your strike has knocked you off-balance, throwing you towards Dierdre. It happens in only a second, yet it feels like forever.\n\n\nYou can only watch helplessly as Dierdre ducks under your off-kilter sword strike, and plunges the jagged remains of her sword into your chest. The mail links you wear offer no protection, they shatter under the force of the blow, allowing the cold steel of Dierdre\u0027s broken sword to pierce deep into your chest.\n\n\nYou drop down on your hands and knees. Everything feels heavy. You collapse on your side, and the pain is so intense that for a moment your vision goes dark.\n\n\nYou taste blood in your mouth, at first you think that maybe you bit your tongue, but the blood keeps flowing, hot and thick, and you realize that the blood is coming from inside your throat; you have a punctured lung.\n\n\nYour death is certain, there is only one thing that matters now. Using all the strength in your broken, bleeding body, you roll further onto your side and stare out at the azure blue of the sea. Cutting across the waters, the fleet sails, quick and true. Your family, your people; they are safe.\n\n\nYou let out a ragged sigh of relief, and a stream of blood oozes out of your mouth. You feel very tired. You try to close your eyes, but then you feel Dierdre\u0027s fingers on your eyelids, keeping them open. Her voice sounds far away, eerily distant, yet at the same time harshly clear\n\n\n\"No. You don\u0027t get to look away. Look at me, Aethelwulf. Look at me. Look at me!\"\n\n\nHer eyes are red-rimmed\n\n\n\"You\u0027ve killed us all! You don\u0027t get to go quietly!\"\n\n\nShe leans in, and her breath is hot against your face\n\n\n\"I. Will. Make. You. Suffer.\"\n\n\nShe drops her hand to the hilt of her sword, still embedded in your chest, and begins to twist. The pain is unbearable, worse than anything you have ever felt.\n","page 223":"\"Your Grace, I come here seeking an alliance with your clan. I hope that you might join me in the fight against William, the usurper\"\n\n\nDierdre raises her eyebrows with interest\n\n\n\"I hadn\u0027t heard that there was any fighting in England.

You can\u0027t be serious, Aethelwulf. I hold all the cards, why would I risk the security of my people when I have nothing to gain for it?\"\n\n\nYou grin callously\n\n\n\"That\u0027s exactly why you\u0027ll do it; for the security of your people. My forces hold the ships, which are their only way out of this place. They\u0027ll fight to the death to keep them. Certainly, your forces will win, but at what cost? How many of your people are you willing to sacrifice, when the only person who needs to die is one of us?\"\n\n\nDierdre\u0027s eyes narrow\n\n\n\"How can I trust your word?\"\n\n\nYou shrug\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t.

The girl, Eadryth, is perhaps seventeen, and looks very much like a younger version of her mother, just with paler skin and far less scars. Like her mother, she wears a kilt and chestpiece of woven leather and chainmail, and a cloak of sewn stoat skins drapes her shoulders. A thick belt loops her waist, and attached to it are two scabbards, one for a short sword and another for a long dirk. Facing you, she performs an elegant curtsy, keeping one hand level above the hilt of her sword; like her mother, she too is clearly an expert fighter. You return her curtsy with a tactful bow and she smiles at you, one part courteous and two parts mischievous.\n\n\nDierdre steeples her fingers and leans in towards you\n\n\n\"My daughter is beautiful, skilled with a sword, and skilled in other ways-\"\n\n\nEadryth winks at you, fingers plucking delicately at the hem of her skirt. Queen Dierdre smiles again, canines flashing in the candlelight. You bite your lip uncomfortably; Dierdre notices and chuckles\n\n\n\"Anyhow, for many reasons, my daughter would make an excellent wife, and many suitors have met the wrong end of my blade trying to court her; for I see them as unworthy.

Oxen and cattle, terrified of the fire, bellow and stomp, slamming into friend and foe alike.\n\n\nArmored and mounted, the Norman riders are practically invincible, and they lash out wildly with their blades, killing indiscriminately.

You try to distract yourself, you clean your gear and sharpen your weapons, but your thoughts are always drawn back to Ryce. The snake. If what Mance says is true, you vow to make him pay.\n\n\nYou run your whetstone mechanically over your sword\u0027s edge, occasionally humming to yourself bits and pieces of various songs. At one point you try to sleep, but your nerves are too on edge and instead you lay there atop your sleeping roll, one hand on the hilt of your sword.\n\n\nFinally, you are broken free from the monotony by the sound of approaching horse hooves. They grow steadily closer, moving at a canter, and then there comes the harsh sound of gravel being kicked up as the mount drags itself to a stop.\n\n\nMoments later, the poacher pulls open the tentflap and slips inside. His hair and face is slicked with sweat, and his clothes are spattered with mud. He wrings his hands with nervous energy\n\n\n\"It\u0027s all true, my lord.

His body is littered with puncture wounds, which ooze blood and viscera.\n\n\nYou turn your attention to the crowd of onlookers and raise your bloody sword\n\n\n\"The traitor is dead!\"\n\n\nSome cheer, others remain in mute silence.

The tent flap is secured by a double set of leather weaving, and you fumble with the straps awkwardly in the dim light until Mance shoves you out of the way and saws through the leather with a knife.\n\n\nUsing your sword, you gently lift up the flap and peek into the tent. In the corner there is an embroidered bedroll. It is crinkled from recent use, but empty. Ryce is not in the tent. You recoil, startling Mance. You speak to him in an agitated hiss\n\n\n\"Ryce isn\u0027t here!\"\n\n\nMance curses and looks around him, as though expecting Ryce to materialize out of the shadows. You attempt to marshal your thoughts, but you are interrupted by a sudden loudness that pierces the deathly quiet.

You run as fast as you can in the direction of the outcry.\n\n\nIn a clearing on the outskirts of the camp, Ryce, lit by the dying embers of several campfires, is surrounded by a score of his soldiers.

As you move through the ranks, your presence spreads like a ripple through water. All across the line your warriors cheer at the renewed appearance of their commander, and spirits are momentarily strengthened.\n\n\nGripping your shield in one hand and your short sword in the other, you stand on the frontline. Below you, the last of the fyrd is being cut to pieces. In front of you, the path is heaped with a tangle of the dead: Normans, Frisians, English, and horses all lie in scattered piles. The circle that your soldiers have formed is battered, but not broken.\n\n\nDuring the initial onslaught the attackers were careless, and they fought in ragged formations. Now they have withdrawn to prepare for their final charge. It is your job to prepare for the final stand. Your position on the hill is the best for defense, so there is no question of trying to move your army. All you can do is wait.\n\n\nAround you, your warriors tighten buckles and stretch tired muscles. Those among the commoners who have gained courage are beginning to fill in the gaps within the shieldwall, bolstering your numbers. Others fetch water from the interior, and others still hastily cut stakes to lie in front of your line. You rest your shield on the ground, always keeping it within arm\u0027s reach.\n\n\nBy now the fyrd is completely destroyed, and the ambushers return their attention to your army. Ryce\u0027s infantry marches to the right and left, encircling your hilltop. While they wait, the Norman and Frisian riders gallop along the foot of the hill, waiting for their opportunity. Someone hands you a ragged waterskin, and you drink deeply. Wiping your mouth, you pass the remainder to the man beside you.\n\n\nFrom below there floats the sound of horns. You pick up your shield, and the men around you do the same. The ring of Ryce\u0027s infantry begins to constrict, ascending cautiously up the hill. You scan the soldiers below for signs of Ryce himself, but the dying sun offers precious little light.\n\n\nAs Ryce\u0027s infantry marches doggedly forward, they create gaps in their line to allow the Norman and Frisian cavalry to fall back. It seems that the opening skirmish of this new battle will be a war of English against English. You raise your voice to address the warriors around you.\n\n\n\"Keep your focus, work together, and above all else; hold the line!\"\n\n\nYou watch the Frisians, who have fallen in behind Ryce\u0027s line of soldiers, and add as an afterthought\n\n\n\"Make sure to keep an eye on those cavalry forces! They\u0027ll be riding uphill, but a horse is still a horse. All it takes is one, and the shieldwall breaks!\"\n\n\nAround you, your men nod in assent. The commoners watch you fearfully, gripping their makeshift weapons with white knuckles. Then, in a haze of movement, Ryce\u0027s infantry breaks into a jog, which picks up speed and becomes a sprint. You grip your sword\n\n\n\"Here they come! Hold fast! Hold-!\"\n\n\nRyce\u0027s soldiers collide with yours, and the two lines are joined with a metallic crunch. You drive your sword into a man with a cloth jerkin, and his blood stains his yellow livery into a mottled brown. You try to pull the blade free, but the tip is caught in the man\u0027s spine, and as he dies the weapon is pulled from your grip. You reach your hand back to tug at the hilt of your long sword, but your hands are slippery with blood and your fingers slide over the pommel.\n\n\nA spear flickers in front of you, ducking instinctively you feel the metal head scrape against your helmet, jarring your neck. As your opponent tries to pull the spear back for a second stab, you grip your hand on the haft and rip back. Your fingers slide momentarily along the smooth wooden shaft, but they become held in place against the iron bar of the spear\u0027s crossguard. Your spear-wielding adversary, a black-bearded man with a crooked nose, snarls and gives the pole a tremendous heave. Instead of resisting, you let the momentum carry you forward. Combining his pull with a forward lunge, you leap forward with lightning speed and slam your shield into his face, shattering his nose.\n\n\nAs his grip loosens from the spear you tear it free from his grip, reverse it in your hands, and drive it into his throat. His blood sprays free, thick globules splattering against your shield.\n\n\nYou smile wide, and your teeth are flecked with red. You drop your shield, and grip your spear with two hands. Moving with wicked precision, you hack, stab, and cut with your spear. You flip the spear around, moving it in arcing circles. Each arc is unique, and each serves a purpose.\n\n\nYou flip your spear, knocking aside an approaching sword thrust. There, a path is open.\n\n\nDriving forward you push your spearhead down the path, and bury its head in the destination. Wrenching the weapon free, you continue making your scything arcs.\n\n\nYou drive deeper through the line of Ryce\u0027s infantry, wreaking ever greater destruction.\n\n\nYour arms are shaking with fatigue, and your fate is sealed in death, yet still you laugh.\n\n\nAs you walk forward into death, you bare your bloody teeth.\n","page 615":"You shrug\n\n\n\"I actually just came to talk, but sure, why not.\"\n\n\nYou hold out your hand and Eamon tosses you his wooden sword. It spins awkwardly in the air and you catch it by its blunted tip.\n\n\nEadryth tears her own sword free from the ground and dusts off the clots of earth stuck to the tip. Having cleaned her blade, she begins twirling it about, flicking it back and forth and even tossing it and catching it. Eamon claps his hands entusiastically, but you merely wait, wooden sword raised and ready\n\n\n\"If you\u0027re going to fight me, come on and fight me. Stop messing around.\"\n\n\nEadryth gives the sword one last high toss before catching it and leveling the blade at your chest\n\n\n\"Fine, fine, fine-\"\n\n\nShe strikes midway through her last word, but you parry easily and retreat a few steps. She pursues doggedly, launching a flurry of blows in your direction. You manage to deflect them all, but several cut perilously close.\n\n\nHaving failed in her attempt to secure a quick victory Eadryth backs off a few paces, pausing to brush her sweat-soaked hair out of her face. She exhales heavily\n\n\n\"By God, you\u0027re fast for an old man\"\n\n\nYou laugh\n\n\n\"With age comes experience-\"\n\n\nThis time it is you who strikes unexpectedly. Your blade lances forward and Eadryth barely manages to knock it aside, stumbling back unevenly from the force of the blow. While she struggles to regain her footing you press your advantage and in a few short strokes the match is over, with Eadryth\u0027s sword having been knocked clean out of her hand and your own wooden blade placed against her throat.\n\n\nEadryth raises her hands palms outward, and you withdraw your sword. She grins, panting\n\n\n\"Christ that was impressive\"\n\n\nHer tone is, if not deferential, then at least as close to deferential as Eadryth will ever be. You incline your head politely\n\n\n\"We oldfolk aren\u0027t entirely useless, you know\"\n\n\nShe laughs\n\n\n\"Clearly not! So, what did you come to talk about?\"\n\n\nYou bite your lip; this is not going to be popular\n\n\n\"I want you both to stay here tonight\"\n\n\nEadryth and Eamon reply immediately and in unison\n\n\n\"Hell no!\"\n\n\nEadryth crosses her arms\n\n\n\"You going to stop me, old man?\"\n\n\nYou shake your head\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t have to.

Guarding the camp? Cleaning out the stables? Checking the inventory-\"\n\n\n\"Leading a frontal assault on London\"\n\n\nYou let that sink in for a moment. Eamon opens his mouth, but you cut him off\n\n\n\"Of course, if you believe that this job is too lowly for the two of you, I can always give the task to someone else...\"\n\n\nEamon shakes his head adamantly\n\n\n\"No, no, we\u0027ll do it, we\u0027ll do it\"\n\n\nYou clap your hands together\n\n\n\"Of course you will, now come, we have strategies to discuss\"\n\n\nYou kneel done and outline the plan in the damp earth.\n\n\nEssentially, while your forces cross the Thames, Eamon and Eadryth will lead a small force to distract the Norman garrison by rushing towards the main walls. This small force will stay just outside of arrow distance, but will carry torches and scream warcries, making themselves as visible as possible.\n\n\nWith the Norman garrison focused on this group at their front gates, your main army will enter into the unprotected slums of the lower city. There you will locate the London Bridge and cross the Thames, at which point you will be able to scale London\u0027s southern walls.\n\n\nOnce inside the city, you will engage with the garrison, with the aim of drawing them off of the walls and into the city\u0027s interior.\n\n\nIf the Normans do abandon the walls to confront your army, Eadryth and Eamon\u0027s force will be able to scale the walls and attack the Norman garrison from behind.\n\n\nIf all goes to plan, tonight the Normans will suffer an irreparable defeat...\n","page 857":"You make camp beside a gentle flowing river.

Drinks are poured and passed around, and campfires are lit.\n\n\nYou accept a cup of ale from Orvyn and take a seat beside a roaring fire.

You neglected to bring your swords, but you have fixed a long dirk to your belt, and you grip the hilt as you follow Mance through the forest.\n\n\nEventually, the lithe figure in front of you stops moving, and sits down atop an overgrown boulder. He addresses you without turning around\n\n\n\"So, you came.\"\n\n\nYou choose a craggy rock opposite to his and sit down, keeping the dirk loose in its sheathe\n\n\n\"Yes, I came. Now talk, why have you brought me here? If this is a trap, I\u0027ll gut you.\"\n\n\nMance nods without concern\n\n\n\"This isn\u0027t a trap. I came here so that I could warn you.\"\n\n\nYou lean in\n\n\n\"Warn me about what?\"\n\n\nMance shifts his position, craning his neck to stare into the darkness around you. He lowers his voice\n\n\n\"Lord Ryce is planning to betray you. He has made a pact with King William. Some time tomorrow, his men and the Frisians will fall upon your own. A battalion of Norman riders will give him aide. Once they have finished slaughtering all your forces, Ryce and the Normans will march on York.\"\n\n\nYou cock your head\n\n\n\"Why should I believe any of this? What proof can you give?\"\n\n\nMance nods, head tilted back slightly\n\n\n\"Send an outrider on a fast horse. Tell him to travel along the road until he reaches a bridge crossing a river. There, he must dismount and track through the marshes on his left. On the other side of the marshes is a clearing, and in that clearing the Norman riders will be camped. I know this because Ryce knows it, and he knows it because he is in league with the Normans. He plots your downfall, my lord. If you are to overcome him, you must act fast.\"\n\n\nYou grit your teeth, overwhelmed by the suddenness of events\n\n\n\"Very well, I will send a rider.\"\n\n\nMance rubs his hands together and stands up to leave\n\n\n\"Good. I will find an excuse to visit your tent in a few hours, when you know the truth for yourself.\"\n\n\nWithout another glance, Mance begins the journey back towards the camp, whistling tonelessly. You run a hand through your hair. If events keep on moving at this pace, you think ruefully, it will be white by the end of the campaign.\n","page 614":"You find Eamon in an empty clearing, sparring with Eadryth.

Moving in secrecy, and accompanied by other survivors of the ambush, he sneaks his way to York, moving ahead of the approaching Norman army. There he joins his mother and rallies the populace, urging them to flee the city.\n\n\nTravelling discreetly, they make for the coast and steal three ships. Setting sail during the dark of night, the leave England and head to the distant lands of Frisia.\n\n\nThey stay there for almost fifteen years, working in tandem with several other minor lords to form a small confederacy.

They remain there for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nAll his life Eamon keeps one eye on England, waiting for a chance to rally an army and avenge your death, but the chance never comes.

His chest is broad and his body muscular, but you notice a distinct bulge in the leather jerkin around his midriff; his infamous love of revelry has not gone unpunished.\n\n\n\"Aethelwulf, you canny bastard!\"\n\n\nHe bellows, grinning and thumping you on the back.\n","page 17":"Inclining your head respectfully, you murmur solemnly\n\n\n\"My liege\"\n\n\nKing Harold laughs madly, and then punches you light-heartedly on the shoulder\n\n\n\"You always were a mannerful bastard, Aethelwulf!\"\n\n\nHe chuckles, long and low.\n\n\n\"But come, I haven\u0027t seen you since our last battle!

You find your soldiers lounging in the grass to the left of king Harold\u0027s men. Some laugh and cajole with each other. Some sharpen their weapons idly. Others play dice with Harold\u0027s Housecarls. One has undone his breeches and is calmly urinating in the direction of William\u0027s army. In short, of the seventy warriors under your command, not a single one looks concerned or frightened.\n\n\nThat makes you proud. Most of these men you trained since boyhood, and for many you serve as a father figure. When they stand beside you at a shieldwall you have absolute confidence in your safety. They would risk their lives to save yours, and you would do the same for any of them.\n\n\nYou only wish you could say the same for your fyrdmen. Nearly a hundred and fifty, and every single one looks terrified. You can hardly blame them. In the clash of a shieldwall, it is the fyrdmen who bear the brunt of the assault. To break a shieldwall, aiming for its weakest combatants is a common strategy. With Harold outnumbered to begin with, more fyrdmen than normal will be forced into the front ranks. The continued success of the English nation could well depend on their spirits.\n\n\nApproaching some of your men, who greet you amicably but respectfully, you instruct them to spread some of your ale reserves amongst the fyrd. Although you always fight sober, many of your men prefer to battle under the comforting haze of ale, and so long as they remain sharp enough you permit it. Some men just aren\u0027t capable of facing the sheer brutality of a shieldwall sober.\n\n\nSomeone calls your name. Turning, you see Harold waving to you from the midst of his group of Housecarls. He grins excitably, filled with the same mad energy that bubbles inside of you. His armor is expertly wrought, fine mail links that shine red under the ominous clouds. At his belt a gold-hilted sword rests in its sheath, and slung across his back is a heavy Daneaxe. His roundshield is thick and red, and is emblazoned with his personal banner; the Fighting Man. A symbol as legendary as King Harold himself, the Fighting Man depicts a golden warrior, wielding a Daneaxe and roundshield. His face is filled with the mad joy of battle, and under his watchful gaze the forces of England will stand against the Norman tide.\n\n\nMoving closer, Harold clasps your forearm with his free hand\n\n\n\"Ready?\"\n\n\nYou nod fiercely\n\n\n\"Always\"\n\n\nHe smiles, but for a moment you see a flicker of emotion cross his face. Tiredness? He opens his mouth slowly, mulling his words\n\n\n\"Once this war is over, I think I\u0027ll-\"\n\n\nOne of Harold\u0027s Housecarls interrupts the conversation\n\n\n\"My liege, the Normans are advancing!\"\n\n\nInstantly, Harold leaps back into action. Waving his shield, he calls not just to his own men, but also to all the men across the English line\n\n\n\"To arms! To arms! Form a shieldwall!\"\n\n\nThe cry of \"shieldwall\" is taken up across the line, as men rush to the front, each shield overlapping with the one to the left, forming an impenetrable wall. In theory. Calling to your men, you order them to form up beside Harold\u0027s.\n\n\nThe fight for England has begun.\n","page 22":"You look back at the camp, where five thousand farmers, butchers, bakers, and other citizens huddle in their cloaks for warmth, or sit by a fire and listen in awe as soldiers tell them tales of battles in faraway lands.

Although Orvyn is not technically in command of your men, you have left your normal commander, Garyn, back at home to guard your wife and children with a skeleton crew.\n\n\nWith Garyn away, Orvyn is stepping in. He is a good commander for battles; he is amicable and courageous, but also capable and firm. In peacetime he would lack the rigid authoritarianism necessary for drilling the men, but right now they need a man to keep them confident. Orvyn inspires confidence; he isn\u0027t especially tall, but he is solidly built and a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\nHis beard and hair are both jet black, and both are kept in place by various bone rings.

Like a stirred anthill, the English encampment is abuzz with activity, men fetching spears and armor, running to and fro, assembling into companies. Opening the chest, your squire first removes a thick jacket of hardened leather, which you will wear under your mailshirt.\n\n\n\"Thank you, Hugh\"\n\n\nYou say to your squire and tousle his curly orange hair absent-mindedly. Hugh grins shyly and then proceeds to bring forth the next piece of armor, the mailshirt itself.\n\n\nBeautifully forged, the chain links shimmer in the dawn light. As the light bounces of the metal, thousands of scratches can be seen, sanded down but still visible; the marks left behind by thousands of blades. This mailshirt has been in your family for generations, stretching back through hundreds of years of bloodshed and war. Slipping into the metal garment, you feel your squire tug at the leather lacings in the back, tightening the mailshirt around your body. You breathe in deeply, and as your chest expands, so too does the mailshirt, acting with the familiarity of a second skin.\n\n\nNext come the metal strips, a personal favorite of yours. Each strip is made of tough iron, and each is covered in serrations and scratches. These you slip under your trousers and Hugh helps lace them tight to your legs. If an enemy were to try and stab at your seemingly unprotected legs their sword would merely slide off the hidden plating, unbalancing them and allowing you to slip under their defenses.\n\n\nWith your shin-plates cleverly hidden, Hugh unwraps the last piece of armor; your helmet. Masterfully crafted, it gleams in the sun. Complete with cheek-guards, a nosepiece, and spectacle-rings to protect the eyes. Surmounting the front is a snarling metal wolf\u0027s head, which stares proudly forward. Slipping the helmet on and tightening the chinstrap, you grin, canines showing.\n\n\nTime to kill some Normans.\n","page 20":"You look back at the camp, where five thousand farmers, butchers, bakers, and other citizens huddle in their cloaks for warmth, or sit by a fire and listen in awe as soldiers tell them tales of battles in faraway lands.

At the bottom of the hill, the Norman forces swarm, but make no attempt to push forward.\n\n\nBy now, your heavy linden shield is weighing your arm down, and your muscles are beginning to tire. Loosening the straps, you place it carefully on the muddy soil, and motion for your men to do the same. They all sigh with relief, and there is much muscle rubbing and idle chatter. So long as they stay in their positions, you allow them to relax.\n\n\nWith forces of this size, the battle could easily take all day. Idly, you watch the Norman forces. They don\u0027t appear to be doing anything of interest. You are about to strike a conversation with Orvyn, when a portion of the Norman line surges forward. Some of the men stumble to their feet, but you wave them down. The hill is at least three hundred feet, and the Normans appear to be on foot. You stare at the mass of men in a state of bewilderment. All of them seem to be fairly lightly armored, none of them sparkle, like the men in mail shirts do. Suddenly, the advance stops, not even halfway up the hill. Why they would just stop seems ridiculous, unless-\n\n\nYou leap up and call out frantically, not just to your men, but to everyone else across the line\n\n\n\"Shields! Shields!\"\n\n\nYou tear yours from its resting place, fasten it to your arm, and then hold it above your head. Other men follow your lead.\n\n\nJust in time. A dark cloud wafts from the Norman advance to the English line. Arrows. Thousands and thousands of arrows.\n\n\nThey whistle through the air like a swarm of enraged wasps, raining down upon the English line. Three arrows strike your shield, each one slamming into the thick wood with hammer blows. Across the line men fall to the deadly barrage, clutching at feathered shafts protruding from throats and chests.\n\n\n\n\nIn all the commotion; the screaming and shouting, the whistling of arrows, you almost miss the noise. That unmistakable drumbeat of horse hooves.\n\n\nBy now the horses are quite close, and the arrow rain has stopped, as the Norman archers are wary of killing their own riders. You drop your shield down and heft your longsword.\n\n\n\"Shields forward! Shields forward! Hold the line!\"\n\n\nYour warriors respond instantly, as do Harold\u0027s Housecarls. Shields drop forward and interlock, forming a solid barrier to thwart the Norman riders. You focus on the rider charging towards you, he has his lance couched under his arm and pointed directly at your shield.\n\n\nSuddenly, as he approaches the line a javelin, thrown by a man behind you, pierces the horse\u0027s chest. The animal screams and froths blood. It drops to its knees and pitches forward, you take a half-step closer and thrust your longsword straight into the Norman\u0027s throat. He chokes hot blood and keels over, falling on top of his dead steed.\n\n\nYou nod in satisfaction. In front of you there now lies a barrier of two dead horses. Looking left and right, you survey the battle-line. As expected, your men and the Housecarls have fared fine, killing or throwing back their attackers.\n\n\nThe same cannot be said for other places on the line. In some places, the Norman riders were able to break through, and although the Normans were quickly killed or driven off, many of the bodies strewn across the field are English.\n\n\nThe shieldwall has held, but barely.\n","page 32":"The rider thunders towards you, his horse kicking up thick clods of mud. Drawing close, he plunges his lance forward, but you slash sideways with your longsword and knock the spear into the ground. The thin lance bends and then breaks, splintering along its core.\n\n\nDisgustedly, the Norman tosses the broken lance aside and moves to draw his sword, but you are already counterattacking. Twisting your wrist, you backswing the blade into the horse\u0027s mouth, lacerating its cheeks and splintering its teeth. The wounded animal screams, wide eyed, and collapses on the ground, trapping its rider.\n\n\nAs the Norman struggles to free himself you slip your blade neatly down his mailshirt and thrust deep, driving a foot of steel into his body. The Norman gasps pitifully and lolls sideways, dead.\n\n\nThe horse is still screaming, kicking up clods of earth. One of its flailing hooves strikes Orvyn\u0027s shield, knocking him back a pace. Recovering, he ducks under the flurry of hooves and swings his axe down, hard, crushing the poor beast\u0027s spine. Its long legs stop moving.\n\n\nSatisfied, Orvyn returns to his position on the shieldwall. Across the line, William\u0027s horsemen meet similar fates. To your right, you watch one of King Harold\u0027s Housecarls fully behead a horse with his Daneaxe, mid-charge. Spurting blood, the headless beast collapses to the ground, and before its rider can regain his footing he meets a similar fate at the hands of the grisly Daneaxe. On the far left, a horse actually breaks through, the rider spearing a man through the neck and then creating an opening by hacking wildly with his sword. His act of valor is short-lived. The fyrdmen swarm the rider from all sides, butchering him with their axes and scythes. The breach in the line quickly closes.\n\n\nThe Norman horsemen who are still alive turn tail and ride their horses back down the hill. The top of the hill is spattered with the corpses of horses and their riders. Perhaps a full three quarters of the charge were vanquished. Orvyn, his face slick with horse blood, grins at you. You grin back.\n\n\nThe shield line has held.\n","page 35":"You have no idea what time it is, but the sun is beginning to lap at the treetops, and a blissfully cool evening breeze wafts around you.\n\n\nYou crouch in the blood-soaked mud, behind the shadow of a horse corpse. The blood is everywhere. It coats your sword. It is spattered across your mailshirt. It is smeared across your face. For the first time in a long while, you want to throw up.\n\n\nThe battlefield is littered with corpses, human and animal. Mostly human. Mostly English. Only a quarter of the fyrd are still alive. No, that\u0027s not right. You look around briefly. Maybe a sixth. No one has remained unscathed, not even Harold\u0027s legendary Housecarls. The shieldwall has been effectively broken, men huddle in small groups behind the cover of dead horses, each spattered with arrows. To stand out in the open is to die.\n\n\nYou peer over the top of your horse carcass. You have done grave damage to William\u0027s forces, but they are still numerous.\n\n\nIn fact, as you watch, you see men advancing. Your hand twitches, an instinctive raising of the shield hammered into your brain by years of training. However, you pause briefly. The masses of Normans aren’t archers, or cavalry. They are infantry. Thousands and thousands of foot soldiers.\n\n\nThroughout the day, William has sent them at you, but never in these numbers. You grip your sword.\n\n\nThe end is near.\n","page 34":"The sun is now high in the sky. You have lost track of the hours, and the number of Norman attempts. Every attack is the same. First comes the barrage, then the charge of cavalry. The fyrd has been decimated, perhaps a third have either died or run away. The toll on the warriors has been lighter, but no less serious. Because of your proximity to the King, your soldiers have been hit hard, and many of their bodies lie limp along the battle-line. You and Orvyn are still in fit shape, although you are both tired, and your arm aches from holding your shield, which has been gnawed to splinters by the constant rain of arrows.\n\n\nA painfully familiar whistling fills your ears. Groaning, you lift up your shield to ward off the barrage. You\u0027re just so, so tired...\n","page 37":"Adding your voice to the English battle cries, you advance on the fleeing Norman foot soldiers. In front of you, one stumbles as his boot slides through a patch of reddened mud. He only falters a moment, but it is enough. Your longsword lances forward, piercing the fleeing Norman\u0027s calf. He screams and falls, holding up his arms to futilely ward off your blade.\n\n\nYou keep moving forward, using your heavy shield to shove the wounded Norman out of your way. Behind you, Orvyn\u0027s axe resonates with a heavy crunch as he finishes off the crippled soldier.\n\n\nAhead of you, another Norman stumbles forward, a heavy javelin slamming into his shoulder. He manages one strangled yelp before your blade connects with his neck, a heavy swing that severs his jugular and jars against his spine. You wrench the sword free and keep moving. This charge has filled you with fresh energy, filling your mind with bloody courage, but now it is starting to ebb and your mind is working more clearly.\n\n\nThere is something very wrong here. This retreat is far too organized, too simultaneous.

He is completely out in the open.\n\n\nYou turn and race towards him.\n","page 36":"The Normans advance, neat and orderly. Their armaments are very similar to that of their riders. Most wear mailshirts, and those bizarre conical helmets. Some carry axes, most carry swords, but all heft the customary Norman blue kite shield. That, at least, is some consolation. Whereas you English fight as a cohesive team, the Norman\u0027s tend to fight as individuals, because the kite shield, although effective, cannot interlock with that of a neighbor\u0027s. Despite your weakened state, a lone Norman is still a dead one.\n\n\nYou crouch low behind the horse corpse and wait. The familiar jingle of mailshirts heralds their arrival. Beside you, Orvyn bristles, but you put a cautionary hand on his shoulder. You want them close.\n\n\nYou wait a moment more, then leap out. Your longsword snakes forward, lashing out at a Norman\u0027s face. He raises his kite shield to deflect the blow, but as he does one of the men on your right sweeps his blade down and cuts into the Norman\u0027s ankle. The man screams and drops to one knee, Orvyn\u0027s axe crushes his jaw.\n\n\nYou press into the gap and push the Normans towards Harold\u0027s Housecarls, whose bloody Daneaxes make short work of the thin kite shields. Ducking under a Norman sword thrust, you stab forwards and gut the man. Kicking him aside, you search for your next opponent...\n\n\nAnd find no one. The Normans are retreating. To your left, you notice King Harold. He waves madly with his axe, and men are surging forward alongside him. With a sudden shock you realize he is trying to rally the men and charge downhill, towards William\u0027s retreating infantry.\n","page 39":"\"Harold!\"\n\n\nYou call out, sprinting towards him. He half turns towards you, and flashes one of his charismatic bright smiles.\n\n\nThe single arrow that flies through the air surprises you more than Harold. Curving gently, it hisses downward and slams into Harold\u0027s eye.\n\n\nHe lets out a startled cough and staggers backward. You keep running towards your king, but a Norman rider cuts in front of you.\n\n\nTurning his horse neatly, the Norman swings his blade and opens your King\u0027s throat, spraying blood.\n\n\nHarold falls to the ground, dead.\n\n\nYou falter indecisively, filled with wordless horror and remorse.\n","page 38":"Some of your men are beginning to join this mad charge. Waving frantically, you call them back to your position. Most capitulate, somewhat reluctantly.\n\n\nWith your men beside you, you pause to get a better look at the retreating Normans. There is something very wrong here. This retreat is far too organized, too simultaneous. The Norman foot soldiers are increasing the distance between themselves and the beleaguered English soldiers, the pounding of their feet grows fainter, but another pounding grows louder. Horse hooves.\n\n\nYou stare with horror, Harold has thrown off his battered shield and carries only a Daneaxe, which he wields two-handed. He is completely out in the open.\n\n\nInstinctively, you turn and race towards him.\n","page 31":"Despite your amusement at the Normans\u0027 lack of strategy, the charge impresses you. The sound of a thousand horses\u0027 hooves pounding the mud and churning the soil, is thunderous. The vibrations shudder under your feet.\n\n\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see some of your fyrdmen begin to back away, and you bark at them to get back into line. They comply gingerly.\n\n\nYou can almost smell their fear.\n\n\n\n\nThe horses are fast approaching the top of the hill. Harold barks out an order to his Housecarls, and one in every two sheathes sword and shield in favor of a Daneaxe. Held two-handed, their reach, in the hands of a capable warrior, is more than enough to counter the reach of a man on horseback.\n\n\nYou take a quick look at the faces of your men. Some are scared, but none show it. Your shieldwall is as solid as a palisade, an impenetrable barrier of wood and steel. The horses are very close now, and the drumbeat of their hooves beats in frantic time with your heart.\n\n\nYou size up the mounted warrior barreling towards you. His horse is a chestnut hue, with a dark black mane. The rider wears a mailshirt and Norman helmet, as well as the customary blue kite shield and a long thin lance.\n\n\nMaking sure your stance is good and firm, you prepare to take on your adversary.\n","page 30":"\"Shields!\"\n\n\nBellows a Housecarl standing to Harold\u0027s right.\n\n\nThe English line reverberates with the clacking sound of wood on wood as men rattle their shields, making sure they overlap with their neighbors\u0027. Leaning forward, Harold waves at you from his position on the shieldwall and grins, his teeth shining in the dawn light.\n\n\nBehind the king, the great Dragon Banners of Wessex fly. Enormous and red, they flap and flutter in the gentle morning breeze, snarling at the approaching Normans. Looking down the hill you watch the Norman advance.\n\n\nIt is simply incredible. At least a thousand horses have lined up at the base of the hill. Their riders wear good mail army, which glints in the light, and long blue Norman kite shields, which provide good full body protection, but are slower and less flexible than your English roundshields. For armaments they carry long lances and spears, as well as longswords. To protect their heads they wear the classic Norman helmets, conical and tall with comically long nasal plates.\n\n\nThe whole situation is laughable. You turn to Orvyn, who stands beside you and is also grinning\n\n\n\"How stupid can these Normans be?\"\n\n\nOrvyn shrugs\n\n\n\"They\u0027re not used to facing real warriors. Killing fleeing peasants is one thing. Riding down a shieldwall, especially uphill? Well-\"\n\n\nHe fails to suppress a chuckle\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s hope they\u0027re slow learners!\"\n\n\nThe men around you laugh, and that laughter drifts up and down the shieldwall. The mood begins to lighten. Still grinning, you sheathe your short sword and draw your long sword from across your back.\n\n\nThe greater reach will make it easier to kill the horses.\n\n\nEasier to kill the fools.\n","page 44":"You sprint full tilt at the Norman rider.\n\n\nYour shield feels heavy on your arm, so you toss it aside.\n\n\nSeeing your approach, the Norman wheels his horse around to face you. He knees his horse into a canter, driving it straight for you.\n\n\nAt the last moment you drop down and slide along the mud of the hill, under the belly of the horse. Thrusting upward, you plunge your blade deep into the horse\u0027s gut, drenching yourself in thick blood.\n\n\nThe horse collapses, but you roll out from under it.\n\n\nYou leap to your feet quickly; the Norman rider is slower to rise. From under the horse carcass, you see the hilt of your longsword protruding.\n","page 43":"You back away, slowly at first, then swiftly.\n\n\n\"Back!

The horses ride towards you from all sides.\n\n\n\"Shields!\"\n\n\nOrvyn echoes the cry. Men embrace briefly, and then turn to lock shields. Someone calls out \"For Harold!” No one cheers.

William II is taken prisoner, he is brought to London and found guilty of numerous charges by a completely unanimous jury.\n\n\nOn August 18, 1067, William II, at nineteen years of age, is executed. In the next four years a wave of bloodshed rips through England. Normans in hiding are methodically sought out and killed.\n\n\nBy 1071, there are none left. Meanwhile, many English lords vie for the throne.\n\n\nIn 1072, an English lord named Ryce takes the throne, and the English monarchy is preserved.\n\n\nAlthough you will be remembered as the man who saved England, your actions resulted in your people being massacred and your family being killed.\n\n\nAs history progresses, facts will fade into legend, but you will always remain.\n\n\nYour name will be lost to history, but you will be remembered instead by your posthumous nickname;\n\n\nThe Bloody Wolf.\n","page 67":"With a short, deft movement, you leap to your left and crack a guard\u0027s knee with your boot.

He is dressed in a plain woolen robe that drapes loosely across his skeletal form. His hands are spotted with age, and his left shakes incessantly.

As he whispers, his head bobs slightly, shaking the wisps of white hair that sparsely cover his head.\n\n\nYou wait patiently for him to finish, ignoring the suspicious glances of the other priests.

Something about its towering austerity lends to its aura of chilling weariness, like the pressure of an invisible hand.\n\n\nYou never really liked churches, and a career as a soldier has done little to improve the situation.

It has been several months since you last saw him, however he hasn\u0027t changed a bit.\n\n\nHe wears a mail hauberk, and his shield -emblazoned with your snarling wolf sigil- is slung over his back. On his left he wears a thick fighting sword, shorter than your longsword but almost twice as thick. On his right he carries a vicious looking seaxe, a heavy stabbing dagger perfect for thrusting through mail links. His face, like much of his body, is scarred by a lifetime of fighting. He is bald, and his hooked nose gives him a predatory, reptilian look. His eyes are hard, flinty; the eyes of a soldier.\n\n\nYou meet in the middle of the bridge and he clasps your forearm warmly, his face shows relief.\n\n\n\"Our scouts saw you coming, I came as soon as I could.

Your eyes sweep the approaching wave of soldiers from under the shadow of your raised shield. Orvyn taps you on the shoulder and directs your gaze to a group of Normans sprinting up the cobblestone road towards your portion of wall. These men, a group of twelve, heft a large roughly cut log; a battering ram. Directly below you sits York\u0027s gate. You swear irritably and grab a soldier standing behind you\n\n\n\"Find me an archer. Now!\"\n\n\nThe soldier salutes nervously and hurries off. You watch the ram-carriers tensely. They have perhaps two hundred meters to go. Orvyn stands ready with his throwing axe, but the weapon has an effective range of barely ten meters and by then it will be too late.\n\n\nThe soldier arrives with another man in tow, this one is no warrior, his woolen tunic and threadbare cloak mark him for a hunter (and possibly a poacher). The hunter carries a leather arrowbag and a polished yew longbow almost as long as you are tall. The archer mumbles a respectful \"milord\", but you cut him off and shove him in front of you, pointing at the group of Normans carrying the battering ram.\n\n\nThe archer nods, licks his lips nervously, and set an arrow to his bowstring, nocking it with the careless ease of a seasoned marksman. Raising the bow, he pulls the string back to his cheek and sights down the shaft, adjusting for the northern breath of wind that whispers across the field. He releases his grip and the bowstring thrums heavily, whipping the arrow into the air. You follow its path through the sky. The arrow tilts up, plateaus, then falls towards the ram-carriers.\n\n\nThe arrow finds its mark, biting into the lead man\u0027s neck, killing him and knocking him into the man behind him. You open your mouth to tell the archer to fire again, but see that he is already drawing another arrow back to his cheek.\n\n\nYou watch with bated breath.\n\n\nBy a hundred and fifty meters four more of the Normans are dead.\n\n\nBy one hundred, another three are felled.\n\n\nBy the time the Normans reach the town, only three are left to drag the battering ram. Your archer sights on his next victim, but then curses; the Norman battering ram crew is using the buildings as cover, and he cannot shoot them.                             Across the wall, your men are having similar problems, although the main Norman assault force is well within javelin range they are all using the ramshackle buildings for cover and your men can only pick off a few unlucky ones. The wave of infantry approaches your walls, battering ram in tow, and you can do little to stop them.\n\n\nSuddenly a heavy thump makes you whirl to your left; a scaling ladder of lashed branches has clattered against your section of the wall. Two more are quick to follow. One of your men leans forward to push the ladder back, sheathing his sword and using both hands. An arrow from below flecks upward and loges itself in his neck, he emits a choked gurgle and topples over the wall, landing with a crunch that is barely audible over the yells of men and clangs of steel.\n\n\n\"Push with your shields! Push the ladders with your shields!\"\n\n\nYour men follow your initiative, shoving at the ladders with their heavy shields. One ladder slams against the wall crenellation directly in front of you, lodging into the stone niche. You move to shove it back, but an arrow whizzes towards you and you are forced to step back and take the blow with your shield. You feel the force of the arrow slam into your shield and travel up your arm, jarring your shoulder. Knocking the arrow loose from your shield, you move towards the ladder-\n\n\nand duck the spear thrust of a snarling Norman warrior who leaps onto the platform of the wall from his position on the ladder. His spear thrust misses you, but it strikes the archer behind you, squarely in the throat, killing him.\n\n\nWhile the Norman\u0027s spear is stuck, you duck under the wooden shaft and slash upwards with your short sword, cutting his neck to the spine. Gushing blood, the Norman falls over, his chainmail making a hefty thudding sound against the wooden platform.\n\n\nYou again try to push the ladder back, but already another Norman is climbing over it. Your eyes flit across the wall and you see that other sections of the palisade are experiencing similar \"difficulties\".\n\n\nWithout warning, the platform shakes tremendously and you are nearly thrown into the arms of the advancing Norman. Instead, your sword greets him, splintering the chainmail links at his stomach and gutting him. He screams hideously, gnashing his teeth and yelling until Garyn drives six inches of steel into his throat.\n\n\nPicking yourself up, you are nearly thrown back down by another wood-splintering crash, stronger than the first. \n\n\nThe Norman battering ram has reached the gate.\n","page 175":"From your position on the wall, the Norman army looks like a sea of grey and blue, a vast horde of colossal porportions.

In that same instant Garyn and Orvyn make their moves. Orvyn hurls his throwing axe into the face of one of the Norman guards, and Garyn kills the soldier whose horse was knocked into by the Commander\u0027s. The soldier stabs with his spear, but his horse is still off-kilter from the blow to its side so Garyn ducks under the spear thrust easily. Hacking upward, he casually severs the guard\u0027s hand, and then finishes the soldier with an efficient stab to the throat.\n\n\nThe remaining soldier guarding the Commander tries desperately to turn his horse but one of your men impales him in the back with a heavy spear.\n\n\nAlone, the Norman Commander tries to break through the wall of men with his horse, but in his panic he saws at the reins too quickly and the horse keels over on its side, lashing out wildly with its hooves.\n\n\nTrapped under the horse\u0027s bulk, the Norman Commander never sees your sword coming.

The Norman prince notices. He smiles coolly, and kneels in the mud in front of you.\n\n\nHefting your sword carefully, he drives it deep into your gut. The pain is more intense than anything you have ever felt in your life. It makes your vision flicker and dull. It also makes your fingers strengthen.\n\n\nAs your lifeblood seeps from your body, you lash out, and in one jagged motion you tear out the arrow embedded in your thigh and drive it deep into the prince\u0027s neck.

The Campaigns are extremely successful, with Dublin falling to your forces in 1070, and all of Ireland south of the Lough Erne being brought under Dierdre\u0027s control by 1072.\n\n\nBy 1077 England and South Ireland have become pinnacles of military strength and economic prosperity; however, ruling has taken its toll, and your constant absence from Dierdre is beginning to cause frustration for the both of you, and so on the summer of that year you abdicate from the throne and allow the witenagemot to choose a successor.\n\n\nAfter some deliberation, they choose the ancient Lord Ryce. His reign is fairly innocuous, as his usual scheming is dampened by his poor health.\n\n\nNow retired, you spend most of your time in the Irish court, with Dierdre. On occasion you return to England to meet with Orvyn and Garyn, both of whom have settled down in a small town that is nestled against the Thames. Though they argue constantly, the two have become good friends and you spend many hours chatting and playing dice in their company.\n\n\nIn 1082 Dierdre, also feeling the weight of her long years in power, hands her kingdom down to a chosen successor and retires. Your remaining years are spent in the company of good friends and family, and you enjoy every moment greatly.\n\n\nWhen you die in 1097 hundreds attend your funeral, and you are buried under the great Cathedral at York, long since rebuilt from its Norman scourge and larger than ever before.\n\n\nWhat started as a simple rebellion has, under your dynamic leadership, become the foundations for a mighty English nation.\n\n\nAnd it all began on a muddy field outside the small town of Hastings.\n","page 516":"You ride hard. Every man, woman, and child in your army ride north with one purpose: avenging the destruction of York. You have all lost people. You have lost enough people to fill a valley to the brim with tears, yet not one person in your army cries, not one eye moistens. You are all filled with fire and brimstone. When the fire burns out you will be nothing more than husks; ash on the wind, but this is of no concern to you. You will all be long dead by then. You are far too outnumbered to attempt a victory. Your goals are far simpler: slaughter as many of the Normans as you can. \n","page 758":"You lie alone in your tent for an hour. Maybe two? You feel old, and tired. Your bones feel cracked and your muscles feel weak. Your breathing is ragged, and your lungs struggle for air.

He clasps his hands awkwardly and averts your gaze\n\n\n\"Forgive my disturbing you, my lord, but we must make a choice.\"\n\n\nYou nod slowly.\n","page 515":"Every single person who fought in your army died that day. Every man, woman, and child was killed during that slaughter under the rain. Yet they did not die without exacting their revenge. Along with the Crown Prince himself, nearly a third of the Norman forces were killed. The remaining two thirds flee in disorganized panic, where many are killed by local farmers.\n\n\nThe rest are exterminated when they run head first into Dierdre\u0027s army. Following your departure, Dierdre immediately ordered her army to turn about and head back to the northeastern coast. Although King William is alerted to this sudden change of direction, poor supply lines and hostile locals severely hinder his attempts to pursue.\n\n\nWith minimal casualties, Dierdre\u0027s forces climb into their ships and depart for Ireland. With them are many of the English commonfolk who followed you south but declined in joining your suicide mission. Dierdre allows them to stay on her lands, and many eventually become her most trusted retainers.\n\n\nIn 1083 King William launches a raid on Dierdre\u0027s Irish kingdom but poor planning, in combination with a storm, turns the raid into a terrible Norman defeat. Two further raids are attempted in the years 1085 and 1089, both of which fail as well. Accepting defeat, William offers yearly payments in exchange for Dierdre\u0027s neutrality. Dierdre accepts, and the payments, bolstered by yearly raids on Frankia, make her small Irish kingdom an incredibly rich one.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the north of England, the civilians suffer greatly. Enraged at the loss of his eldest son, King William sends a second army in 1068 to complete the job of the first: burning the north to the ground. The event will become known as the \"Harrying of the North\", and one in every four northerners are killed.\n\n\nIn place of your rule, an English turncoat named Lord Ryce rules the north, suppressing all signs of insurrection with a brutal efficiency.

The arrow rain is even thicker now, a combination of your increased proximity to the wall, and the likely augmentation of the wall\u0027s garrison.\n\n\nYet, despite the heavy arrow fire, you cannot help but smile a little; you are nearly at the ditch. Had it rained recently, this might have posed a more serious problem, but the spring has been unusually dry this year and the ditch is devoid of water. Nevertheless, the long wooden stakes remain, and threading through them greatly risks exposure to the hail of arrows.\n\n\nHolding your shield high, you slide carefully down the crumbling earthen slope of the ditch, steadying yourself with one hand on one of the stakes. The arrows are like malicious hornets; they hum angrily, seeking your men as they struggle through the stake-lined ditch.\n\n\nPushing steadily forward, you keep your arm raised above your head. The arm aches with a lead-like intensity, but you ignore it. To drop your hand would be to die. The arrows that ram into your shield\u0027s bulk are proof of that. Weaving amongst the stakes, you at last reach the inner slope of the ditch. It is not so steep, but the soil is loose, and you are forced to scrabble up it awkwardly, kicking with your feet and digging in with one hand, all while still raising the iron weight of your shield over your head. Several arrows bury themselves in the earth around your feet, but none strike you and you escape the ditch unscathed.\n\n\nOnce you reach the safety of the wall you press yourself up against it for safety. Arrows whistle overhead, but none are aimed at you; hidden by the angle and shadow of the wall, you are safe for now. Your eyes rest on the ditch; it has become a bloodbath. Men, mad with pain, writhe and scream, knocking others off their feet. Disorganized and packed tight, almost every arrow finds its target. Soldiers pressing forward must climb over piles of dead and dying men.\n\n\nSlowly, so slowly, your men climb out of the ditch and arrange themselves under the wall. Someone stands close beside you, for a moment the dirt and blood of the ditch obscures his identity, but you quickly realize that it is Orvyn. He grins without mirth and points at the ditch, crawling with bodies\n\n\n\"What a hell-hole, huh?\"\n\n\nYou nod, every muscle aching\n\n\n\"Yes. Now for the hard part\"\n","page 789":"You point at the Frisians riding ahead of you\n\n\n\"The Normans are ruthless, and that ruthlessness makes them effective. To win this war, sometimes we have to be ruthless too, and the Frisians happen to be very good at being ruthless\"\n\n\nLaila watches the red-cloaked horsemen pensively\n\n\n\"If the Normans are ruthless, and we\u0027re ruthless too, why are they bad and we\u0027re not?\"\n\n\nYou chew at your lip\n\n\"Well, perhaps it\u0027s a bit of an oversimplification to see it as good and bad, but to put it generally; we\u0027re good because we\u0027re fighting for our land, and they\u0027re bad because they\u0027re trying to steal it.\"\n\n\nLaila purses her lips\n\n\n\"Why don\u0027t we just let them have the land?\"\n\n\nYou laugh\n\n\n\"Have you been speaking to Father Wilfrid? No, we cannot simply give them our land. To do so, to submit to our oppressors, would bring us great dishonor. Not to mention, it is likely that King William will levy higher taxes, and purge the remaining English nobility in the coming years. Our survival may well rest on this insurrection.\"\n\n\nLaila looks confused\n\n\n\"So it\u0027s dishonorable to steal land, but it\u0027s honorable to kill people, but only because those people were stealing land?\"\n\n\nYou chuckle\n\n\n\"Honor is a complicated thing. It\u0027ll make more sense when you\u0027re older. In the meantime, rest easy, and don\u0027t worry too much about these things. Your mother and I will keep you safe.\"\n\n\nLaila keeps watching the Frisians\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\nYou tousle her golden hair\n\n\n\"That\u0027s my girl\"\n\n\nYou lean over precariously in your saddle and plant a kiss on Catheryn\u0027s cheek\n\n\n\"And there\u0027s my other girl. I should get going...\"\n\n\nCatheryn kisses you back\n\n\n\"Alright, see you tonight then\"\n","page 304":"Once outside of Chester\u0027s walls you get your first good look at the Frisian cavalry company. Sitting astride their slender mounts, their faces have a look of haughty indifference; a clear indicator of either young hotheads or seasoned veterans. You suspect the latter.\n\n\nMost wear chain, although some sport only boiled leather. All carry a long thin cavalry lance, as well as sword and shield. Tied firmly to their saddlebags many also carry wicked looking throwing spears with barbed tips. Whether it be on a cloak, helmet plume, or shield guard, all of the Frisians wear a deep red. The slight size of their mounts make them look deceptively passive, but you know trained warriors when you see them.\n\n\nMance, riding a chestnut male warhorse, nudges his mount towards you\n\n\n\"Are we ready, my Lord?\"\n\n\nYou nod and flick your reigns\n\n\n\"Yes. Let us move onward to York\"\n\n\nAs your army of horses accelerates a frantic shout catches your attention\n\n\n\"Wait! Wait! Stop!\"\n\n\nBeside you, Mance swears unenthusiastically\n\n\n\"Right.

You\u0027ve already met the Lady Alodia, haven\u0027t you, my Lord?\"\n\n\nYou exhale tiredly\n\n\n\"Yes, we met\"\n\n\nYou watch the young girl maneuver her steed, a pale grey pony, with great difficulty and more than a little weaving. Captain Mance grins\n\n\n\"Well. You\u0027re the father in law, so I\u0027ll leave this to you\"\n\n\nBefore you can reply he flicks his reigns and moves ahead of you. Exasperated, you wheel your horse around and canter back to Alodia, who is swaying uneasily in her saddle. You extend a hand\n\n\n\"Here. Get on\"\n\n\nShe hesitates a moment, eyes staring fixedly at the ground. One hand frays nervously at the hem of her dress. The other one is locked in a death grip around the reigns of her pony. Out of patience, you wrap your arm around her waist and haul her up onto the saddle in front of you. She shrieks and flails her legs, striking Thunder\u0027s flank and making the surprised warhorse snort angrily. You release the reigns of your horse and wrap both arms around her\n\n\n\"Stop. Struggling. Or we\u0027ll both fall.\"\n\n\nShe subsides, sitting ramrod still. Her face is chalk white and you can see the fabric of her dress move up and down as she breaths in quick, short gasps. You grit your teeth\n\n\n\"Will you calm down? We\u0027re not even moving yet!\"\n\n\nShe bites her lip nervously, staring down at her lap\n\n\n\"I\u0027m s-sorry, my lord. I\u0027m- I\u0027m not used to riding\"\n\n\nRegretful of your outburst, you try to calm her, tousling her hair as you often do with your own daughter. While Laila would giggle and toss her golden locks carelessly from side to side, Alodia\u0027s face reddens uncomfortably and you see her hand twitch, resisting the urge to straighten her now imperfect auburn hair. You stare fixedly ahead and flick the reigns, thinking irritably; this is going to be a long trip.\n","page 546":"You make it about halfway across the field before you are spotted.

Him and a dozen other archers with bows pre-strung loose their arrows. Most fall short or strike the wall, but four strike the Norman guard and he staggers backwards, disappearing from your view.\n\n\nUnfortunately, your shots came too late, and more guards are appearing on the walls. Some of them carry shields. Many of them carry longbows, arrows nocked.

We\u0027ll encircle them!\"\n\n\nMance salutes quickly, already turning to address the Frisian horsemen. They stand ready, eagerly adjusting straps and pulling forth javelins from their saddlebags. Their mares all paw at the ground excitably. At a signal from one of the Frisians, the others form up into two neat columns, creating a deadly pair of horns.\n\n\nAcross the field, the Norman riders are barreling down at your forces, arranged loosely in a ragged line. Satisfied that the Frisians are in order, Mance nudges his horse towards yours\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll wait for them to encircle the Normans, then follow behind.

Orvyn god damn it get back here!\"\n\n\nAbove the noise of horse hooves and men shouting it is unclear whether or not he hears you, either way, he keeps moving, leaving you with Rorik and Accen. They nod at you stiffly, equally unhappy at having been left behind. Alodia slouches meekly, staring at Thunder\u0027s neck.\n\n\nIn the field, the two groups of cavalry ride towards one another, the Normans in their loose line and the Frisians in their two curved horns. You, Alodia, Rorik and Accen watch with bated breath as the two groups close the distance between each other, large Norman warhorses staring down at lithe Frisian mares.\n\n\nThen, as if by magic, just when the Norman line is meters from the Frisians, their formation collapses. Even from where you stand you can hear the Normans shouting wildly, sawing at their reigns in desperation. The Norman steeds buck wildly, slamming into each other as they try to reach the Frisian mares. The flanks of the Norman line curl rapidly outwards bowling dozens of horses off their feet, and although you cannot hear the bones snap, you wince all the same. Alodia makes a faint mewling sound and buries her face in your mailshirt. Awkwardly, you pat her hair with your shield-hand\n\n\n\"Shhh, don\u0027t worry. Your father\u0027s men are well trained; they\u0027ll break the Norman line. In fact they already have\"\n\n\nShe presses her face deeper into the mail links of you armor\n\n\n\"It\u0027s not that.

You watch the cavalry battle. As the Norman charge peels outward the Frisian horns deftly rejoin into a triangle that drives straight through the Norman line, circling around and attacking them from behind. Garyn and Orvyn, leading your troops, are following in the gap made by the Frisian force, picking off Norman stragglers. The battle is not over, but it has clearly been won. Whole groups of Normans are dismounting and surrendering, and the field is littered with the corpses of Normans and horses alike. There are few Frisians amongst the dead.\n\n\nWith the main force broken, the Frisians use their deadly javelins on any Normans trying to flee, skewering them and their horses. Orvyn and a number of your men seem to be taking on the task of rounding up Norman prisoners, and stopping Garyn from executing them. The Normans who are found by Orvyn and your men generally live. The ones found by Garyn and the Frisians are less lucky.\n\n\nSomeone nudges your arm; you turn and see that Rorik has moved his horse closer. He tugs his straw colored beard anxiously\n\n\n\"Lord, there are Normans riding for us\"\n\n\nYou follow his pointing arm and see that he speaks true; a group of six riders are galloping towards you. All have their weapons drawn. Reaching around Alodia, you draw your long sword\n\n\n\"Form around me! Most likely they\u0027re just running and we\u0027re in their way! We\u0027ll swerve around them and let them pass!\"\n\n\nNormally, you would be tempted to pursue them, but with Alodia onboard you don\u0027t dare to try. The Normans draw closer. Accen looks at you nervously\n\n\n\"They\u0027re coming right for us!\"\n\n\nYou jerk your reigns\n\n\n\"Move! Cut around them!\"\n\n\nAccen and Rorik swerve right, you swerve left. Immediately the Normans split off to pursue both parties, two chasing you and the other four curving to intercept Rorik and Accen. Burdened by Alodia, you hold your sword and shield awkwardly, trying to cover both you and the girl simultaneously.\n\n\nThe four Normans reach Rorik and Accen first, they reign in quickly, Rorik parrying deftly with a long sword and Accen using a heavy axe. One of the riders tries to circle around Rorik, but he drives his horse forward, ducking under the Norman spear and stabbing him in the throat with his sword. The Norman topples off his horse, and is shortly joined by another rider, felled by Accen\u0027s brutal axe.\n\n\nYou shift your attention to the two riders who are moving to intercept you. Both are charging towards you with spears leveled. Moving quickly, you dart your horse past them, deflecting one of the spears lightly with your long sword and back-swinging a glancing blow across one of the rider\u0027s thighs. The man screams in agony, hot blood running thickly down his leg. You jerk the reigns of your horse and Thunder responds instantly, turning to face your wounded opponent. Without hesitation, you plunge your sword into the back of his neck. You saw the blade backwards and blood sprays freely from the wound, spattering both you and Alodia. The girl shrieks, hugging you tightly and nearly dislodging you from your saddle.\n\n\nYou steady yourself and readjust, facing your single remaining opponent. His mad charge has sent him a far distance away, and he gallops back towards you furiously, whipping at his reigns. Across from you Rorik and Accen are still dueling with the two other Normans. Suddenly, the one fighting Rorik saws at his reigns and appears to flee from the conflict. Rorik instantly gives chase, and you realize what is about to happen moments before it does. Powerless to intervene, you watch the Norman rider twist around in his saddle and heave his spear backwards, impaling Rorik. Leaving the spear buried in the man\u0027s gut, the Norman draws his sword and cuts Rorik\u0027s head clean off, already heading onwards towards Accen before Rorik\u0027s head even hits the ground.\n\n\nIt is only reflex that saves you. You hear the hoof beats of your approaching Norman adversary and twist your shield instinctively. The spear scrapes across the edge of your shield, splintering it and sending a jolting pain up your shoulder. As the rider passes you attempt to stab at him with your sword but Alodia\u0027s body is in your way so the swing is ineffectual and clumsy.\n\n\nNot too distant, you hear a jarring scream and turn to see Accen clutching at a gushing wound in his side. One of the Norman riders lies dead in his saddle, face crushed by Accen\u0027s axe, but the other is still alive and he uses his short sword to deftly cut Accen\u0027s throat. Turning your horse, you gallop towards Accen\u0027s killer, who, wholly unprepared for your arrival, tries to deflect your blow with his sword instead of his shield. With casual precision you slip your long sword past his blade and drive the sword deep into his shoulder. He screams, and so does Alodia, and you ignore both and swiftly behead the man with one savage blow.\n\n\nBehind you, the remaining horseman waits motionless. From his chest protrudes a long Frisian javelin, blood gushing down its shaft.\n\n\nVictorious, your army has returned.\n","page 549":"The fight for the wall is brutal and bloody. Neither side gives quarter. The Normans fight bitterly, but many of those on the wall are only archers, poorly armed for a melee, and when faced with your snarling warriors they die easily.\n\n\nYour side had more than its share of casualties though; men died in droves climbing London\u0027s walls, and the ditch and earth around the wall are fields of corpses.\n\n\nThe Norman banners are struck from their posts; they fall to the ground, the blue turning purple as it mixes with the blood that soaks the stones of the wall. London\u0027s outer perimeter has been captured, but the battle is far from won.\n\n\nFrom within the city, William\u0027s archers have regrouped and are renewing their barrage; on the wall your men are easy targets.

At a signal from one of the Frisians, the others form up in neat rows, each one slightly wider than the previous, creating a deadly wedge of spears and horse hooves.\n\n\nAcross the field, the Norman riders are barreling down at your forces, arranged loosely in a ragged line.

You turn and, unslinging your shield from your back and fixing it to your arm, you stride along the London wall.\n\n\nYour sword is death in your hand, raw and pure, and any Norman who crosses with it ends with their blood spilt on the parapet\u0027s stone floor.\n","page 309":"\"Form an arrowhead! We\u0027ll ride through them!\"\n\n\nMance salutes quickly, already turning to address the Frisian horsemen. They stand ready, eagerly adjusting straps and pulling forth javelins from their saddlebags. Their mares all paw at the ground excitably. At a signal from one of the Frisians, the others form up in neat rows, each one slightly wider than the previous, creating a deadly wedge of spears and horse hooves.\n\n\nAcross the field, the Norman riders are barreling down at your forces, arranged loosely in a ragged line. Satisfied that the Frisians are in order, Mance nudges his horse towards yours\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll wait for them to break through, then follow behind. If we move in too quickly, our own horses might get drawn in by the Frisians\u0027 mares.\"\n\n\n\"Will this work?\"\n\n\nHe grins\n\n\n\"Just wait. Their line will become a complete mess\"\n\n\nYou smile\n\n\n\"Well then, let\u0027s ride!\"\n\n\nMance shakes his head firmly\n\n\n\"Sorry, no. You\u0027re an infantryman, not a rider, and you\u0027re too valuable to lose. While we fight them in the field, you will stay here\"\n\n\nYou try to protest but Mance and Orvyn look at you pointedly and you throw up your hands in disgust\n\n\n\"Oh come on!\"\n\n\nOrvyn is already turning his horse to move alongside Mance\n\n\n\"Me and Garyn will lead our English forces. We\u0027ll leave two with you. Rorik! Accen! Stay here and protect Lord Aethelwulf!\"\n\n\nYou splutter indignantly\n\n\n\"You can\u0027t- you\u0027re not- you... Orvyn god damn it get back here!\"\n\n\nAbove the noise of horse hooves and men shouting it is unclear whether or not he hears you, either way, he keeps moving, leaving you with Rorik and Accen. They nod at you stiffly, equally unhappy at having been left behind. In the field, the two groups of cavalry ride towards one another, the Normans in their loose line and the Frisians in their tight triangle. You, Rorik and Accen watch with bated breath as the two groups close the distance between each other, large Norman warhorses staring down at lithe Frisian mares.\n\n\nThen, as if by magic, just when the Norman line is meters from the Frisians, their formation collapses. Even from where you stand you can hear the Normans shouting wildly, sawing at their reigns in desperation. The Norman steeds buck wildly, slamming into each other as they try to reach the Frisian mares. The flanks of the Norman line curl rapidly inwards bowling dozens of horses off their feet, and although you cannot hear the bones snap, you wince all the same. Entranced, you watch the cavalry battle. The Frisian triangle has punctured the Norman line and is now peeling off on either side to attack the flanks from behind. Garyn and Orvyn, leading your troops, are following in the gap made by the Frisian force, picking off Norman stragglers.\n\n\nThe battle is not over, but it has clearly been won. Whole groups of Normans are dismounting and surrendering, and the field is littered with the corpses of Normans and horses alike. There are few Frisians amongst the dead. With the main force broken, the Frisians use their deadly javelins on any Normans trying to flee, skewering them and their horses. Orvyn and a number of your men seem to be taking on the task of rounding up Norman prisoners, and stopping Garyn from executing them. The Normans who are found by Orvyn and your men generally live. The ones found by Garyn and the Frisians are less lucky.\n\n\nSomeone nudges your arm; you turn and see that Rorik has moved his horse closer. He tugs his straw colored beard anxiously\n\n\n\"Lord, there are Normans riding for us\"\n\n\nYou follow his pointing arm and see that he speaks true; a group of six riders are galloping towards you. All have their weapons drawn. You draw your long sword\n\n\n\"Form around me! Most likely they\u0027re just running and we\u0027re in their way! We\u0027ll swerve around them and let them pass!\"\n\n\nOn foot, you would be tempted to pursue them, but you don\u0027t trust your own horsemanship to be on par with theirs. The Normans draw closer. Accen looks at you nervously\n\n\n\"They\u0027re coming right for us!\"\n\n\nYou jerk your reigns\n\n\n\"Move! Cut around them!\"\n\n\nAccen and Rorik swerve right, you swerve left. Immediately the Normans split off to pursue both parties, two chasing you and the other four curving to intercept Rorik and Accen. Unaccustomed to fighting on horseback, you hold your sword and shield awkwardly.\n\n\nThe four Normans reach Rorik and Accen first, they reign in quickly, Rorik parrying deftly with a long sword and Accen using a heavy axe. One of the riders tries to circle around Rorik, but he drives his horse forward, ducking under the Norman spear and stabbing him in the throat with his sword. The Norman topples off his horse, and is shortly joined by another rider, felled by Accen\u0027s brutal axe. You shift your attention to the two riders who are moving to intercept you. Both are charging towards you with spears leveled. Moving quickly, you dart your horse past them, deflecting one of the spears lightly with your long sword and back-swinging a glancing blow across one of the rider\u0027s thighs. The man screams in agony, hot blood running thickly down his leg. You jerk the reigns of your horse and Thunder responds instantly, turning to face your wounded opponent. Without hesitation, you plunge your sword into the back of his neck. You saw the blade backwards and blood sprays freely from the wound, spattering you thickly.\n\n\nShaken by the force of the blow, you steady yourself and readjust, facing your single remaining opponent. His mad charge has sent him a far distance away, and he gallops back towards you furiously, whipping at his reigns.\n\n\nAcross from you Rorik and Accen are still dueling with the two other Normans. Suddenly, the one fighting Rorik saws at his reigns and appears to flee from the conflict. Rorik instantly gives chase, and you realize what is about to happen moments before it does. Powerless to intervene, you watch the Norman rider twist around in his saddle and heave his spear backwards, impaling Rorik. Leaving the spear buried in the man\u0027s gut, the Norman draws his sword and cuts Rorik\u0027s head clean off, already heading onwards towards Accen before Rorik\u0027s head even hits the ground.\n\n\nIt is only reflex that saves you. You hear the hoof beats of your approaching Norman adversary and twist your shield instinctively. The spear scrapes across the edge of your shield, splintering it and sending a jolting pain up your shoulder. As the rider passes you attempt to stab at him with your sword but you mistime the swing so the blow is ineffectual and clumsy.\n\n\nNot too distant, you hear a jarring scream and turn to see Accen clutching at a gushing wound in his side. One of the Norman riders lies dead in his saddle, face crushed by Accen\u0027s axe, but the other is still alive and he uses his short sword to deftly cut Accen\u0027s throat.\n\n\nTurning your horse, you gallop towards Accen\u0027s killer, who, wholly unprepared for your arrival, tries to deflect your blow with his sword instead of his shield. With casual precision you slip your long sword past his blade and drive the sword deep into his shoulder. He screams, but you ignore him and swiftly behead the man with one savage blow.\n\n\nBehind you, the remaining horseman waits motionless. From his chest protrudes a long Frisian javelin, blood gushing thickly down the shaft. Victorious, your army has returned.\n","page 308":"For nearly four hours your company has rode unchallenged, and as you neared your own lands, you began to think you might get there without an incident. You were wrong. Half-asleep in his saddle, Garyn squints off into the distance\n\n\n\"What\u0027s that glittering?\"\n\n\nYou answer automatically\n\n\n\"The sun\"\n\n\nThen you realize that he is staring eastward. Turning, you stare into the distance, searching for the flashing lights that Garyn observed. Riding beside you, Orvyn points towards a copse of birch trees standing idle amongst the fields that you are passing through. Partially obscured by the spindly trunks you make out mass of moving shapes. You turn to Orvyn\n\n\n\"Are those horses?\"\n\n\nHe nods\n\n\n\"And armored riders. At least a hundred\"\n\n\nYou turn around in your saddle and call to Mance, leading his Frisians behind you\n\n\n\"We\u0027ve got company!\"\n\n\nMance grips his sword\n\n\n\"Damn.

They will be upon you in less than a minute\n","page 790":"Urging Thunder onwards, you climb up a slight hill, and use the elevation to search for your family amongst the line of people that stretches along the dusty road.\n","page 550":"Any minute now the arrows will come flying, and your army will be shot to pieces\n\n\n\"Charge! Charge now!\"\n\n\nYou scream it a third time, voice cracking from the sudden shock of a raised voice. For a terrifying moment no one moves. Then, like a wave, your army surges forward. Digging your heels into the clotted earth, you sprint towards London.\n\n\nThe arrows come thick and fast. In the night air they are impossible to spot, they can only be heard, and then whether they strike your shield or your exposed legs is a matter of luck. Two arrows strike your own shield; one strikes the shield\u0027s metal boss and ricochets off, the other lodges in the rim.\n\n\nOthers are not so lucky. Running with a shield is no easy feat, and it tends to leave a great portion of flesh exposed. The Norman arrows seem to have a wicked sense of where to land, and all around you men fall, screaming and clutching at arrows that seem to sprout from their bodies.\n\n\nYour breath is becoming ragged in your throat, you are not exhausted, but you can feel the fatigue beginning to creep through your legs and down your shield arm.\n\n\nThe arrows continue to pour down, not in volleys, but seemingly in a continuous hail that cuts through your army. Although you cannot see it, you know that as it races forward your army is leaving behind a trail of the dead and dying. Gritting your teeth, you block out the noises and press onward towards the walls of London.\n\n\nThe arrow rain is even thicker now, a combination of your increased proximity to the wall, and the likely augmentation of the wall\u0027s garrison. Yet, despite the heavy arrow fire, you cannot help but smile a little; you are nearly at the ditch. Had it rained recently, this might have posed a more serious problem, but the spring has been unusually dry this year and the ditch is devoid of water. Nevertheless, the long wooden stakes remain, and threading through them means slowing down, which greatly increases your chance of getting shot.\n\n\nHolding your shield high, you slide carefully down the crumbling earthen slope of the ditch, steadying yourself with one hand on one of the stakes. The arrows are like malicious hornets; they hum angrily, seeking your men as they struggle through the stake-lined ditch. Pushing steadily forward, you keep your arm raised above your head. The arm aches with a lead-like intensity, but you ignore it. To drop your hand would be to die. The arrows that ram into your shield\u0027s bulk are proof of that.\n\n\nWeaving amongst the stakes, you at last reach the inner slope of the ditch. It is not so steep, but the soil is loose, and you are forced to scrabble up it awkwardly, kicking with your feet and digging in with one hand, all while still raising the iron weight of your shield over your head. Several arrows bury themselves in the earth around your feet, but none strike you and you escape the ditch unscathed.\n\n\nOnce you reach the safety of the wall you press yourself up against it for safety. Arrows whistle overhead, but none are aimed at you; hidden by the angle and shadow of the wall, you are safe for now. Your eyes rest on the ditch; it has become a bloodbath. Men, mad with pain, writhe and scream, knocking others off their feet. Disorganized and packed tight, almost every arrow finds its target. Soldiers pressing forward must climb over piles of dead and dying men.\n\n\nSlowly, so slowly, your men climb out of the ditch and arrange themselves under the wall. Someone stands close beside you, for a moment the dirt and blood of the ditch obscures his identity, but you quickly realize that it is Orvyn. He grins without mirth and points at the ditch, crawling with bodies\n\n\n\"What a hell-hole, huh?\"\n\n\nYou nod, every muscle aching\n\n\n\"Yes.

Eamon twists in his saddle and the sword begins to slide, its greased blade slipping easily across the leather of the saddle. Emitting a startled yelp, Eamon lashes out instinctively with his hand and grabs the blade, gripping it with his cloth-wrapped hand.\n\n\nYou curse loudly\n\n\n\"For Christ\u0027s sake Eamon!

You promised that I could marry Lynette!\"\n\n\nYou laugh, harsher than you intended\n\n\n\"I did nothing of the sort. I encouraged your relationship, only because it was healthy for you to have someone to-\"\n\n\n\"To what? Have sex with?

You think the exact same thing about yourself.\"\n\n\nHe spits at your feet and then turns away. You watch him go tiredly. You hear someone shuffling their feet lightly behind you. You turn and find yourself facing Alodia. She fidgets erratically with her sleeve and speaks with a quiver in her voice\n\n\n\"H-he doesn\u0027t really like me, does he?\"\n\n\nYou let out a tired sigh\n\n\n\"Give him time. Eventually he\u0027ll see sense\"\n\n\nShe nods, but looks doubtful\n\n\n\"Sure...\"\n\n\nYou shake your head\n\n\n\"Just give him some time\"\n\n\nYou try to think of something more to say, but a Frisian soldier arrives and interrupts your thoughts\n\n\n\"Captain Mance wishes t\u0027see you\"\n\n\n\"Right.

The fighting is getting harder; the Normans are beginning to reorganize, they are working in larger groups.\n\n\nYou have been wounded several times now. Most of the wounds are trivial, but one is serious. It is an open gash just above your hip, and every step you take causes your leg to jerk with pain. The wound is not so deep, but it bleeds viscously. You try to ignore it and carry on.\n\n\nWhen you find your first clue as to your son\u0027s whereabouts, you nearly stumble over it. At your feet lies Eadryth, legs splayed and one arm holding her chest. Her fingers are red and blood oozes from between them, mixing with the muddy water pooled beside her. You kneel down delicately and place a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\n\"Eadryth?-\"\n\n\nHer free hand lashes forward, knife glowing dully in the grey light. You leap out of the way, barely avoiding its keen edge. Eadryth props herself up one elbow and grimaces\n\n\n\"Oh, it\u0027s you. I thought-\"\n\n\nYou cut her off briskly\n\n\n\"Have you seen Eamon?\"\n\n\nShe nods, then winces from the pain and bites her lip\n\n\n\"Mm hm, he went to fetch bandages for me\"\n\n\nShe laughs, a hollow sound with no humor behind it\n\n\n\"I told that sweet fool he should have run. We both know I\u0027m not getting out of here alive\"\n\n\nYou move in a little closer, and deftly move her hand off the wound. She inhales sharply, but lets you examine the gash. The tear is circular, and ragged around the edges, but the bleeding appears to have slowed. The wound is serious, but not untreatable.\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t be stupid. That little cut won\u0027t kill you\"\n\n\nEadryth laughs through gritted teeth\n\n\n\"It\u0027s not the wound I\u0027m worried about, it\u0027s the Norman- Look out!\"\n\n\nYou spin around and deflect a sword thrust from an opportunistic Norman. The man hefts his kite shield confidently, placing his feet in a fighter\u0027s stance. You mimic him, feet matched. He teases forward with his sword, testing you. You parry every blow with quiet patience, waiting for an opening.\n\n\nThe man grins, exposing a row of ale-yellowed teeth. Then his smile turns to a grimace and he collapses to the ground. Behind him, Eamon wipes the blood from his sword with the sleeve of his soaking wet jerkin. Under his arm he has tucked a roll of cotton bandage, also sopping wet.\n\n\n\"Father?\"\n\n\nYou nod curtly, and then turn back to Eadryth\n\n\n\"Do you think you can stand?\"\n\n\nShe holds her side gingerly\n\n\n\"Probably. I can\u0027t run or fight though...\"\n\n\n\"You won\u0027t have to. Eamon, save the bandages for later; the wound isn\u0027t bleeding that much. Help her up, then the two of you need to head to the horse paddock.\"\n\n\nEamon helps Eadryth cautiously to her feet. She hisses sharply and holds the side of her chest, but otherwise makes no objection. With one arm supporting Eadryth, Eamon looks at you over his shoulder\n\n\n\"You\u0027re coming with us, right?\"\n","page 310":"\"Form two prongs! We\u0027ll encircle them!\"\n\n\nMance salutes quickly, already turning to address the Frisian horsemen. They stand ready, eagerly adjusting straps and pulling forth javelins from their saddlebags. Their mares all paw at the ground excitably. At a signal from one of the Frisians, the others form up into two neat columns, creating a deadly pair of horns.\n\n\nAcross the field, the Norman riders are barreling down at your forces, arranged loosely in a ragged line. Satisfied that the Frisians are in order, Mance nudges his horse towards yours\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll wait for them to encircle the Normans, then follow behind. If we move in too quickly, our own horses might get drawn in by the Frisians\u0027 mares.\"\n\n\n\"Will this work?\"\n\n\nHe grins\n\n\n\"Just wait. Their line will become a complete mess\"\n\n\nYou smile\n\n\n\"Well then, let\u0027s ride!\"\n\n\nMance shakes his head firmly\n\n\n\"Sorry, no. You\u0027re an infantryman, not a rider, and you\u0027re too valuable to lose. While we fight them in the field, you will stay here\"\n\n\nYou try to protest but Mance and Orvyn look at you pointedly and you throw up your hands in disgust\n\n\n\"Oh come on!\"\n\n\nOrvyn is already turning his horse to move alongside Mance\n\n\n\"Me and Garyn will lead our English forces. We\u0027ll leave two with you. Rorik! Accen! Stay here and protect Lord Aethelwulf!\"\n\n\nYou splutter indignantly\n\n\n\"You can\u0027t- you\u0027re not- you... Orvyn god damn it get back here!\"\n\n\nAbove the noise of horse hooves and men shouting it is unclear whether or not he hears you, either way, he keeps moving, leaving you with Rorik and Accen. They nod at you stiffly, equally unhappy at having been left behind. In the field, the two groups of cavalry ride towards one another, the Normans in their loose line and the Frisians in their two curved horns. You, Rorik and Accen watch with bated breath as the two groups close the distance between each other, large Norman warhorses staring down at lithe Frisian mares.\n\n\nThen, as if by magic, just when the Norman line is meters from the Frisians, their formation collapses. Even from where you stand you can hear the Normans shouting wildly, sawing at their reigns in desperation. The Norman steeds buck wildly, slamming into each other as they try to reach the Frisian mares. The flanks of the Norman line curl rapidly outwards bowling dozens of horses off their feet, and although you cannot hear the bones snap, you wince all the same.\n\n\nEntranced, You watch the cavalry battle. As the Norman charge peels outward the Frisian horns deftly rejoin into a triangle that drives straight through the Norman line, circling around and attacking them from behind. Garyn and Orvyn, leading your troops, are following in the gap made by the Frisian force, picking off Norman stragglers. The battle is not over, but it has clearly been won. Whole groups of Normans are dismounting and surrendering, and the field is littered with the corpses of Normans and horses alike. There are few Frisians amongst the dead.\n\n\nWith the main force broken, the Frisians use their deadly javelins on any Normans trying to flee, skewering them and their horses. Orvyn and a number of your men seem to be taking on the task of rounding up Norman prisoners, and stopping Garyn from executing them. The Normans who are found by Orvyn and your men generally live. The ones found by Garyn and the Frisians are less lucky.\n\n\nSomeone nudges your arm; you turn and see that Rorik has moved his horse closer. He tugs his straw colored beard anxiously\n\n\n\"Lord, there are Normans riding for us\"\n\n\nYou follow his pointing arm and see that he speaks true; a group of six riders are galloping towards you. All have their weapons drawn. You draw your long sword\n\n\n\"Form around me! Most likely they\u0027re just running and we\u0027re in their way! We\u0027ll swerve around them and let them pass!\"\n\n\nOn foot, you would be tempted to pursue them, but you don\u0027t trust your own horsemanship to be on par with theirs. The Normans draw closer. Accen looks at you nervously\n\n\n\"They\u0027re coming right for us!\"\n\n\nYou jerk your reigns\n\n\n\"Move! Cut around them!\"\n\n\nAccen and Rorik swerve right, you swerve left. Immediately the Normans split off to pursue both parties, two chasing you and the other four curving to intercept Rorik and Accen. Unaccustomed to fighting on horseback, you hold your sword and shield awkwardly.\n\n\nThe four Normans reach Rorik and Accen first, they reign in quickly, Rorik parrying deftly with a long sword and Accen using a heavy axe. One of the riders tries to circle around Rorik, but he drives his horse forward, ducking under the Norman spear and stabbing him in the throat with his sword. The Norman topples off his horse, and is shortly joined by another rider, felled by Accen\u0027s brutal axe.\n\n\nYou shift your attention to the two riders who are moving to intercept you. Both are charging towards you with spears leveled. Moving quickly, you dart your horse past them, deflecting one of the spears lightly with your long sword and back-swinging a glancing blow across one of the rider\u0027s thighs. The man screams in agony, hot blood running thickly down his leg. You jerk the reigns of your horse and Thunder responds instantly, turning to face your wounded opponent. Without hesitation, you plunge your sword into the back of his neck. You saw the blade backwards and blood sprays freely from the wound, spattering you thickly.\n\n\nShaken by the force of the blow, you steady yourself and readjust, facing your single remaining opponent. His mad charge has sent him a far distance away, and he gallops back towards you furiously, whipping at his reigns.\n\n\nAcross from you Rorik and Accen are still dueling with the two other Normans. Suddenly, the one fighting Rorik saws at his reigns and appears to flee from the conflict. Rorik instantly gives chase, and you realize what is about to happen moments before it does. Powerless to intervene, you watch the Norman rider twist around in his saddle and heave his spear backwards, impaling Rorik. Leaving the spear buried in the man\u0027s gut, the Norman draws his sword and cuts Rorik\u0027s head clean off, already heading onwards towards Accen before Rorik\u0027s head even hits the ground.\n\n\nIt is only reflex that saves you. You hear the hoof beats of your approaching Norman adversary and twist your shield instinctively. The spear scrapes across the edge of your shield, splintering it and sending a jolting pain up your shoulder. As the rider passes you attempt to stab at him with your sword but you mistime the swing so the blow is ineffectual and clumsy.\n\n\nNot too distant, you hear a jarring scream and turn to see Accen clutching at a gushing wound in his side. One of the Norman riders lies dead in his saddle, face crushed by Accen\u0027s axe, but the other is still alive and he uses his short sword to deftly cut Accen\u0027s throat.\n\n\nTurning your horse, you gallop towards Accen\u0027s killer, who, wholly unprepared for your arrival, tries to deflect your blow with his sword instead of his shield. With casual precision you slip your long sword past his blade and drive the sword deep into his shoulder. He screams, but you ignore him and swiftly behead the man with one savage blow.\n\n\nBehind you, the remaining horseman waits motionless. From his chest protrudes a long Frisian javelin, blood gushing thickly down the shaft. Victorious, your army has returned.\n","page 552":"The fighting is harder than you expected. There are more Normans than you had anticipated, and your men are tired from the climbing. Even the wild Irish are faltering.\n\n\nYou push onward with dogged resolve, but London\u0027s twisting narrow streets form a disorienting rat maze and behind every corner lurks a Norman soldier.\n\n\nSomething flashes in your peripheral vision and you turn, just barely avoiding a sword thrust delivered by a Norman soldier who has been hiding in the doorway of a ramshackle house on your left. You turn and face the Norman, but he is already dead; one of your men has run him through with a spear. You turn and keep moving forward, heading instinctively towards London\u0027s heart.\n\n\nThe roads are getting thicker, and instead of dirt they are now blanketed with cobblestones. When you turn a corner, the street becomes wider still, wide enough that you are able to reform a shieldwall that spans eight men from end to end. You have just enough men with you to make the row two men deep. The sudden closeness of the soldiers around you fills your nose with the rank scent of blood and sweat, but you are grateful nonetheless; when in enemy territory a shieldwall is comforting thing.\n\n\nWhat isn\u0027t comforting is accidentally running straight into a group of Norman soldiers. It happens as you round a corner, taking one of London\u0027s many hairpin turns. One moment you are hefting your shield confidently, the next you round the corner and get knocked over by a Norman soldier. Neither one of you was expecting the other, that much is clear by the Norman\u0027s horrified expression. The only difference between you and him is that you recover quicker. Using your shield as a ram, you slam it into his chin, throwing him back. Before he can rise, you drive your short sword into his throat.\n\n\nThe street around you is a tangle of men, your warriors and the Irish grappling with the Normans. The Normans seem to have the numbers, but your troops have recovered quicker. A Norman soldier is driving his spear into the stomach of one of your men; you leap forward and eviscerate him with your sword. Turning swiftly, you deflect a wildly swung mace. The Norman carrying it snarls at you in French, and then dies, stabbed from below by an Irish warrior that both you and the Norman had assumed to be dead.\n\n\nThis is the nature of the fight; men grapple, then fall, then either die or get back up again to fight again. For a street it is surprisingly wide, but for a battleground it is still far too narrow and the fight is more butchery than swordplay.\n\n\nWhen the fighting is done you are drenched in blood, as are all your men. Half are bloodstained because they, like you, have done their fair share of killing. The other half are bloodstained because they lie on the bloody cobblestones, some moaning, some silent. None are destined to see the dawn light. Of the fifteen men who followed you around the bend, only seven remain.\n","page 794":"\"Eamon!\"\n\n\nHe turns in his saddle to look back at you\n\n\n\"Yes Father?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m sorry, Eamon. About losing my temper with you. I shouldn\u0027t have done that.\"\n\n\nEamon shrugs, but his voice is warm\n\n\n\"No worries Father, I shouldn\u0027t be so careless.\"\n\n\nYou scratch the back of your neck, searching for an errant itch\n\n\n\"It\u0027s fine, you\u0027ve got plenty of time to learn. It\u0027ll get easier from here, I promise. The first bit of action is always the hardest. Once you see blood often enough, you get used to it.\"\n\nEamon nods, but you can tell that it is more than the blood that disturbed him. What is eating at him is the poison; watching those Normans die agonizing deaths, killed in underhanded fashion. There is an unspoken accusation in Eamon\u0027s glance, but you do not acknowledge it.\n\n\n\"I should be going\"\n\n\nEamon inclines his head courteously\n\n\n\"Of course, Father.\"\n","page 551":"You grip the rough wooden handles of the ladder unsteadily. I must be mad, you think to yourself. The ladder shakes wildly; there is a bizarre game of tug-of-war at play here. Above you, the Normans are trying hard to heave the ladder back and send you tumbling to your death, however below you your men are pressing into the ladder\u0027s frame with all their might, keeping it level.\n\n\nAll the while arrows and even rocks are being pelted down at you and the other climbers. Moving with speed born from adrenaline and a desire to not become an arrow-pincushion, you hurry up the rungs of the ladder.\n\n\nYou are close to the top now; a spear lashes out from above and just misses, passing above your shoulder. Lashing out, you grab it and yank forward, heaving the Norman over the edge of the wall. The man dangles there, half his body on one side and half on the other.\n\n\nWhile he squirms you move upwards, using his flailing body as cover. Just as the man is beginning to regain his purchase do you strike.

Another Norman approaches from the other side, but he is preoccupied trying to knock the ladder down. You draw your sword and run him through, then turn and slash the archer across his chest.

It is in a large courtyard where your army is making its stand. The fighting is chaotic and disordered; there are no battle lines, only a mix of blue kite shields clashing against oak round shields.\n\n\nFrom the rooftops, Norman archers rain down arrows into the skirmish, but the fighting is so blended that arrows strike friend just as often as foe. In fact, some of the archers on the roofs have put down their bows, patiently waiting for your army to group together and form an easier target.\n\n\nYou and your men stand at the edge of the skirmish, hidden by the shadow of a tall house at the end of your alleyway. Soon, someone will notice your presence and you will become embroiled in the melee. The courtyard is at a slight angle, and from your vantage point you are awarded a fairly clear view of the battle.\n\n\nIn the heartbeats that follow, the most turbulent of your entire life, two things come to your attention.\n\n\nThere, not a hundred meters away from you, stands King William. Guards surround him, but they form a semi-circle, and the semi-circle is directed at the chaotic melee, not at you. If you sprint now, you just might be able to attack him before the guards get a chance to recover.\n\n\nHowever, King William is not the only person who catches your eye. There, in the heart of the battle, Eamon fights with desperate aggression. Eadryth stands beside him, and although the two fight with skill and courage (Eamon having more of the latter and less of the former), both are wounded and both are surrounded. Eamon clutches periodically at a wicked gash at his leg, and one of Eadryth\u0027s arms hangs lamely at her side; the arm has been broken in at least two places. Around them, the circle of Normans closes in.\n\n\nYour heart beats with patronizing steadiness.\n","page 797":"Eamon rides his horse precariously, one hand gripping the reigns and the other cleaning a sword that sits balanced delicately on the front of Eamon\u0027s saddle. As Eamon\u0027s horse picks its way over stones and pits in the road, the sword tilts back and forth, and Eamon grips it awkwardly with his oilcloth to prevent it from sliding off his saddle.\n\n\nYou approach Eamon from behind and call out to him. Eamon twists in his saddle and the sword begins to slide, its greased blade slipping easily across the leather of the saddle. Emitting a startled yelp, Eamon lashes out instinctively with his hand and grabs the blade, gripping it with his cloth-wrapped hand. You wince, thanking god for Eamon\u0027s luck\n\n\n\"Eamon, if you didn\u0027t happen to have that oilcloth wound around your hand, that sword would have cut a nasty line down your palm\"\n\n\nEamon nods, white faced\n\n\n\"I know, Father, I\u0027m sorry-\"\n\n\nYou shake your head\n\n\n\"It\u0027s fine, just try to be more careful next time.

Orvyn told me that he was quite impressed with your form. May I see the sword?\"\n\n\nEamon holds it delicately, and extends it blade-first towards you. You grip the point deftly and flip it, catching it neatly at its handle. You check the blade quickly, turning it over and looking at it from different angles.

Although your forces are broken and fearful, the Normans are little better and King William has no choice but watch your army retreat into the darkness. He and all the Norman soldiers within London are living on borrowed time.\n\n\nUnder Dierdre\u0027s command the Irish and English soldiers quickly reorganize, and within a fortnight the second assault on England begins. This one is just as bloody as the last, but this time it is the Normans who fare the worst. Despite his young age Eamon commands the English forces to great effect, and despite her broken arm Eadryth fights beside him for the entirety of the battle.\n\n\nWith most of his forces dead William makes a desperate stand within the main keep of London, but his remaining forces are overwhelmed and he is himself killed personally by Dierdre in a duel that (though short and painfully one-sided) quickly becomes exaggerated into a legendary tale of both Irish and English folklore.\n\n\nWith King William dead the Norman forces collapse and flee the city. Those who survive the initial rout are killed over the following months by brutal reprisals exacted by the bitter peasant populations.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Eamon has larger problems. Backed by Dierdre and his newly wed wife, Eadryth, Eamon ascends to the throne, however his ascension is not uncontested. Suspicious of an Irish queen and largely Irish army, the Witenagemot secretly searches for a more \u0027English\u0027 ruler.\n\n\nThey find their answer in the Northern lord Ryce, who raises an army and marches south to dispute your son\u0027s claim. The Civil War that ensues is long and bloody, and it ends inconclusively in 1075 with an uneasy truce that remains eternally on the brink of collapse.\n\n\nWeakened by the civil war, both the North of England under Ryce and the South under Eamon and Eadryth fair poorly. As time passes the wounds begin to heal, but it is slow work, and the peasants suffer the hardest.\n\n\nYour sense of duty and loyalty brought the Norman Conquest to its knees, but in doing so you left England in the middle of a Civil War that cost the people far more than the Norman conflicts, and worse still, you left it divided.\n","page 799":"Urging Thunder onwards, you climb up a slight hill, and use the elevation to search for your family amongst the line of people that stretches along the dusty road.\n","page 318":"You nod solemnly\n\n\n\"These are dark days.

The English uprising has been utterly crushed, leaving King William as the sole ruler. Your family; however, escapes the carnage, and Catheryn and Laila meet up with Eadryth and Eamon. After tending to Eadryth\u0027s wound, the group heads aimlessly northward, joining other survivors from your army as they move.\n\n\nThe Normans are too busy looting the wrecked camp, but soon they begin mounting excursions, hunting for escapees from the slaughter.\n\n\nWith England no longer safe, your family, along with forty others, steal a ship and flee to Ireland. The following years are difficult, with Dierdre dead and almost all of her warriors gone, Eadryth and Eamon struggle to hold on to Dierdre\u0027s Kingdom, losing large swaths of land in the east and south to the incursions of other clans.\n\n\nYet, by 1073 the tides of fortune begin to turn once more. After a series of decisive victories under the Blue-Wolf banner carried jointly by Eadryth and Eamon, many of the clans that had previously opposed them clamor to be nominated as vassals under the Blue-Wolf sigil. As their fame grows more and more of Ireland falls under their control, and by 1078 the kingdom surpasses the size it held during Dierdre\u0027s days.\n\n\nDuring this time Eadryth gives birth to three children; two girls and a boy. Meanwhile in England King William consolidates his hold on power, commissioning immense fortifications to protect against any future raiders.\n\n\nWith England now steeled against invaders, Eadryth and Eamon remain in Ireland for the rest of their lives, occasionally raiding the South of England, as well as the more unprotected Frisia. All his life Eamon keeps one eye on England, waiting for a chance to rally an army and avenge your death, but the chance never comes.\n\n\nSeveral times he considers organizing an army, but on all of these occasions he is dissuaded by Catheryn.

You raise the cloth high in the air, let it flutter in the wind for a few moments, then release it and let it glide, wraith-like, through the forest.\n\n\nSignal recieved, the attack commences, and the forest whispers, reverberating the sound of hundreds of soldiers creeping forward towards London.\n","page 332":"An arrow flashes past you, inches from your face. You curse and raise your shield, tucking your body closer against the rough stones of the castle wall. Beside you, puffing and grunting, two of your men hoist a rickety wooden ladder. Another arrow whips down, this one aimed at the two ladder-bearers. You catch it easily with your shield.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get that ladder up boys!\"\n\n\nOne of the ladder-bearers mutters something under his breath and you take a half-second to shoot him a withering glance, which he pretends not to notice. This last month hasn\u0027t been easy, almost every day has been spent rallying, marching, and capturing castles such as this one. You, your men, and your Frisian allies have worked in a frenzy of activity, taking castle after castle back from the Norman occupiers. This castle, you vow, will be next.\n\n\nAbove, you hear a ragged scratching and see that the teeth of the ladder have found purchase a foot below the crenellations of the wall. You couldn\u0027t have hoped for better placing. A Norman leans precariously over the wall to try and shove the ladder away, and a spear thrown by one of your men strikes the Norman soldier squarely in his shoulder. His body topples over and lands beside you, corpse crunching wetly as it strikes the hard ground. Hardly sparing him a glance, you grasp the wavering ladder firmly and proceed to climb, shield slung over your back for ease and protection.\n\n\nYou move up as fast as you can, hand over hand, hauling the enormous weight of your armored body steadily up the ladder\u0027s steep incline. The wall itself is only four meters high, but scaling it in full chainmail makes it feel like a mountain.\n\n\nOnce you approach the top you draw your short sword and swing it haphazardly over the crenellations. Sure enough, you hear the heavy clatter of backpedalling footsteps and seize your opportunity, hoisting yourself over the stonework and dropping onto the wall\u0027s wooden platform.\n\n\nThree Normans turn to face you, one on your left, one on your right, and one teetering at the edge of the platform right in front of you. Moving before any of the enemy soldiers can react, you drop down and lash out with a steel-rimmed boot, catching the precarious Norman in the shin. He lets out a sharp yelp and plunges backwards into the keep, arms pin-wheeling uselessly.\n\n\nThe Norman on your left moves to strike, but he is knocked off balance by a javelin which bites into the wood of his shield. You move as though to strike at him, but then twist and backswing your longsword into the face of the unsuspecting Norman at your right. The blade cracks the man\u0027s jawbone roughly, his mouth opens and spills thick blood.\n\n\nYou tear the sword free and face your original target, who has recovered his position and faces you cautiously, kite shield held high. Unfortunately for him this restricts his view and so when one of your men clambers up the spindly wooden ladder the Norman doesn\u0027t see him until it is too late. His scream is short and ugly, cut off as your warrior drives his sword even deeper into the Norman\u0027s throat.\n\n\nHoisting your shield, you tear off towards the raised hulk of the gatehouse, boots clacking heavily against the warped wooden platform. Across the wall more ladders are being raised and more of your warriors (as well as more than a few Frisians) rally behind you, quickly overcoming anyone blocking your path.\n\n\nYou take the descending stairs two at a time, vaulting carelessly and almost getting yourself impaled on the end of a Norman spear. Using your elevated position to your advantage, you twist and slam your boot squarely into the man\u0027s chest, knocking him off the stairs and into the mud and filth below. Stepping over him, you sprint to the heavy wooden gate, ensconced by a frame of thick stone.\n\n\nSix Norman soldiers are working furiously, shoving heavy pieces of timber in place to prop up the doors, which are being battered relentlessly by your outside forces. Your sword works with a deadly malice and two of the Normans are dead before any of them realize they are under attack. Turning, the exhausted Normans try to mount a defense and are quickly cut down, falling amidst the piles of timber.\n\n\nYour men quickly work to clear away the debris at the gate, and two burly Irishmen heave at the huge wooden bar that keeps the gate shut. While they work you and three other men guard their backs.\n\n\nThe Normans are attacking with a vengeance, arrows buzz like angry hornets, hammering into your shield and killing the man on your left. Soldiers, blue kite shields raised, storm your position, at least two dozen strong. You heft your sword confidently, feet dug firmly into the wet soil beneath you. So long as you strength left in your sword arm and a battle cry left in your lungs you vow not to take a single step backwards.\n\n\nYou don\u0027t have to. Behind you the gates crash open and your soldiers spill forth like an angry gale, crashing into the Norman defenders.\n\n\nAs you stand still, more and more warriors pass by you, jostling to capture the Norman castle. You breath a silent sigh of relief. Although pockets of resistance still no doubt remain, the battle has been won. You wipe your sword clean with a swath of cloth tied to your belt.\n\n\nAll that\u0027s left now is to secure the castle and establish a garrison. Then you can head home. You slide your short sword back into its sheath and think to yourself smugly; all in a good day\u0027s work.\n","page 574":"You shake your head\n\n\n\"I\u0027m finding your mother and sister first. Don\u0027t wait for us. Find a horse and get out of here. Now\"\n\n\nEamon bites his lip; his eyes flick around with nervous energy\n\n\n\"Please find them, Father pl-\"\n\n\n\"I will. Now go\"\n\n\nEamon turns and begins walking down the path, supporting a limping Eadryth with one arm. The road ahead seems clear. Without any more hesitation you head back into the thick of the fray.\n","page 331":"Light trickles between the scraggly branches that hang above you. The air is cool, but not cold, and slender green buds are sprouting from the wiry branches.\n\n\nYou shift uncomfortably, and you chainmail clinks audibly in the heavy silence. Several heads turn swiftly at the abrupt noise and beside you Mance places a finger to his lips. The message is clear: shut up. You roll your eyes and lie back down carefully on the dry ground beneath you, a position that you have been maintaining for nearly an hour. Mance stretches silently, unlike you, him and his men wear leather, daubed with mud and moss for camouflage.\n\n\nTo disguise the glitter of your mailshirt you have wrapped a tawdry wool cloak around yourself, much to the amusement of Mance\u0027s Frisians. These warriors are among Mance\u0027s finest, skilled raiders accustomed to lying in wait beside a road for hours before striking.\n\n\nToday, you are lying in wait for a moderate party of Normans, around thirty strong, rumored to be in the area. Instead of riding in and cutting them down, as you would have preferred, Mance has decided to send one of his warriors out to lure them into the clearing where you all wait. You scratch idly at the dirt, drawing striations in the earth with your finger. Needless to say, the boredom is killing you. And yet, you are still here. You are still here because you know it will work, as it has worked countless times before.\n\n\nFor a month you have been conducting these ambushes around the northern countryside, and the effects are clearly visible. Norman patrols seldom leave their castles anymore, and tax collectors have all but disappeared from the North. By day, the commonfolk toil in their fields, silently cursing the Normans and praising your attempts to dislodge them. By night, they raise their axes and pitchforks and scour the forests for Normans to harass.\n\n\nThese attacks prompt repercussions, and Norman soldiers quickly march towards the villages in question, intent on butchering the rebellious farmers. Which brings them right to you.\n\n\nYou grin and grip your longsword, which is hidden under a pile of dead leaves beside you. Your short sword is safely tucked in its scabbard at your side. Like all of Mance\u0027s raiders, you carry no shield, which would only hinder you in the wild fighting of these forest clashes. There are no shieldwalls, and no cohesive lines. Each man fights as an individual. You only have fifteen soldiers with you, including the scout Mance sent as bait, but you are not terribly worried; these warriors seem proficient. Each of them carries a bundle of deadly Frisian javelins, barbs gleaming wickedly. Each also carries either an axe or sword. No, you affirm, I doubt we\u0027ll run into any serious trouble.\n\n\nYou hear footsteps; moving quick. You move your sword a little, making sure it isn\u0027t snagged on anything. You hear breathing, ragged. You raise the sword a little, several leaves peel away from the blade, exposing its shimmering surface. Suddenly, a young man swathed in ragged green clothing carrying a long knife bounds into the clearing. None of the Frisian warriors move to attack him, and you realize belatedly that he is the scout that Mance sent earlier to lure the Normans towards you. Catching his breath, he speaks to Mance in the rapid Frisian tongue that is completely alien to you. Mance nods and flicks his attention towards you\n\n\n\"Get ready, he says they\u0027re coming\"\n\n\nYou grin and edge yourself into a crouched position, shielded from view behind a thick oak tree. All of Mance\u0027s warriors have similarly hidden themselves. You wait, holding your sword vertically, pressing it into the shadow of the tree. You hear many feet crackling through bare underbrush. You hear shouting, in French. You whisper across to Mance\n\n\n\"Let the first few pass, then we strike\"\n\n\nHe nods, and then peeks carefully around the corner of his tree. You see his eyes flash back and forth, then he ducks back behind cover. He holds up four fingers, then five on the other hand, opening the hand, then closing it, then opening it again, this time with four fingers. You mouth \u0027okay\u0027. Each finger represents an approaching soldier, and each hand a position. As per the plan, you will let the initial four pass by, then you and Mancee will attack the nine men in the following group. Once the other warriors have finished killing the four Normans, they will attack from the flanks.\n\n\nYou breath in and out, readying yourself. You wish Orvyn was here, he had a knack for this sort of thing. He is, however, in the field as well, stalking another group of Normans with Garyn and a small crew of English and Irish. The pounding and crunching gets closer, and suddenly the four Norman soldiers have run past you, completely oblivious to your presence.\n\n\nYou smile grimly, they still believe they are the ones who are hunting, not the other way around. You hear more trampling. This is it. You hear heavy breathing, more footsteps.\n\n\nYou take a final breath, then step out from behind cover and swing your sword. The blow catches the running Norman straight across the neck, digging into the bone. You tear the sword free and, before any of the other Normans can react, you drive your sword into the stomach of another, shattering the links of his mailshirt. Ripping the sword free, you duck back and face your opponents. Three men face you, two carrying spears and the third bearing both a sword and kite shield.\n\n\nLeaping forward with a snarling yell you deflect a spear thrust with your blade then backswing the longsword into the face of the other spear-carrier. He steps back and you duck under the shaft of his spear, skewering up with your sword and snaking the blade under his mailshirt and into his chest. Kicking the dying man back you leave your longsword embedded in his chest and turn, slapping aside a sword-thrust with your mail-covered forearm.\n\n\nThe remaining two soldiers circle you cautiously, but then suddenly the one with the spear collapses; his throat has been cut from behind. In his place stands Mance, bloody and triumphant. In his hands he holds two reddened short swords. The remaining Norman turns to face Mance but then is struck on the shoulder by a Frisian javelin.\n\n\nAs he recoils in shock you wrench your longsword free of the Norman corpse and drive the blade through his armpit and into his chest. You nod briefly to Mance\n\n\n\"Thanks\"\n\n\nHe is already turning to face the next group of Normans, the remaining seventeen of the thirty. They face you and Mance cautiously, weapons raised, feet testing the ground for purchase. Their caution is their undoing. In a flash the forest is thick with Mance\u0027s warriors, attacking the Norman force on all sides.\n\n\nYou charge at a Norman carrying a mace, but he falls backward, a javelin piercing through his eye. Instead, you face a Norman fleeing from a pair of Frisian warriors. As he passes, you swing your sword in a heavy downward cut, biting into the leather of his boots and sweeping him off his feet. As he struggles to rise you bury your longsword in his chest. You rip the sword free and search for a new opponent, but find none.\n\n\nThe Normans are all dead, and the forest is silent once more. You wipe your sword clean with a swath of cloth. All that\u0027s left now is to strip the Normans of their weapons and armor, and then hide the bodies in a ditch. Then you can head home.\n\n\nYou sling the longsword over your back and think to yourself smugly; all in a good day\u0027s work.\n","page 573":"Your heart burns, worse than that: it aches. Something is digging at your chest. Not something, you realize; someone, and that someone is yourself. You are the cause of the pain that you are feeling.\n\n\nYet you cannot break from your duty. You cannot yield. Not now. Not ever. With one hand holding a sword and the other braced with a shield, you have no free hand to hold your son, so instead you muster as much feeling as you can into your face\u0027s tired muscles\n\n\n\"Of course son. I\u0027ll be right behind you. Now come on, let\u0027s go!\"\n\n\nYou make sure that the path to the stables is clear, always keeping one step behind your son.\n\n\nLeashed to a large oak tree, a strong beige charger paws the ground with one hoof, spooked by the screams and the lashing rain that fill the air. You sheath your sword and lace your fingers, hoisting Eamon into the horse\u0027s saddle.\n\n\nNext, you heave Eadryth up, she gasps as her side stretches, but with Eamon\u0027s help you get her sitting in front of him. Eamon twists in the saddle to face you\n\n\n\"You\u0027ll be right behind us, right?\"\n\n\nYou lie smoothly\n\n\n\"Of course, I just need to find Thunder.

You give his horse a slap on its flanks and it takes off at a canter, eager to leave. You watch them disappear into the cloak of the heavy rain.\n\n\nThen, you begin to move, but not towards the stabling area. You have work to attend to.\n","page 334":"Emboldened by yet another successful attack, your band of skirmishers rides back to York in high spirits.

The tree stands at the edge of the ash grove, and the horse seems discomforted by its isolation; it paws the ground nervously and watches you with large baleful eyes. Most importantly, however, is the thick leather saddle already on the horse, buckles fastened.\n\n\nYou touch Eamon on his shoulder\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll take that one there; the bay charger\"\n\n\nHe nods, and Eadryth inclines her head weakly.

They are many.\n\n\nYou count twelve marching in a semi-circle towards you, with another half-dozen tied up in minor skirmishes with the last of the people from the stable. Soon those people will be dead, and the half dozen will join the semi-circle.\n\n\nYour eyes flick up to Eamon. His hand reaches for the hilt of his sword, and he is already twisting the reins to turn the horse around. You act first. Using just the very tip of your sword, you slash the horse across its rump. It screams with fear and anger, head whipping and teeth gnashing. Its great hooves dig into the muddy ground and rip it into clods, tearing off into the forest. Helpless, Eamon can only hold on and watch as you fade into the distance.\n\n\nYou watch him too.\n\n\n\"I love you Eamon. Godspeed.\"\n\n\nYou turn back to face the semi-circle.

You snarl impatiently, you whip your sword back and forth and it hisses hungrily\n\n\n\"Come on. Come. On! Come! On!\"\n\n\nThey come. And some of them die, but the tight circle of their shields boxes you in and hampers your long sword, which whistles angrily as it cuts wildly through the air, weaving over and around the tangle of blades and spears and shields.

They\u0027ve been marching since dawn\"\n\n\n\"So we should probably let them rest for a day?\"\n\n\nShe laughs\n\n\n\"They\u0027re Irish warriors! If I tell them to march, they\u0027ll march \u0027til their feet fall off, and the first to complain will get beaten down by his comrades.\"\n\n\nShe shrugs\n\n\n\"You are right though, if they\u0027re to be in prime fighting shape they should take today to set up camp. Plus, it\u0027ll give them a chance to finish the fortifications here. The stakes are nearly done, but I want them to put in a ditch as well.\"\n\n\nYou nod\n\n\n\"Good, let them rest then. Tomorrow we leave\"\n\n\nDierdre rubs her hands together, green eyes flickering\n\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!\"\n\n\nShe slaps the flank of your horse amicably, and then turns her attention to a group of men struggling to plant a stake into the rocky ground. Striding over to them, she strikes one over the head and then proceeds to berate the rest in wild Gaelic.\n\n\nWhile she deals with her wayward soldiers, you make your way to the high stone walls of York.\n","page 579":"You grab her by the shoulder, hard, and your blood-rimmed nails scrape against her skin\n\n\n\"It will work!\"\n\n\nYou look down at Laila and bite your lip, softening your tone\n\n\n\"It has to work.\"\n\nCatheryn shrugs your hand free from her shoulder\n\n\n\"Yes, I guess it has to, doesn\u0027t it?\"\n\n\nShe opens her fingers and lets the bloody dagger slip out of her hand.

Just in case.\"\n\n\nCatheryn nods and slips the knife into the folds of her sleeve, keeping her arm raised awkwardly. Gently, you take her arm and remove the dagger.

With the torrential rain still pouring, the Normans are in no mood to look at you or your two \"prisoners\" too closely.\n\n\nHaving found a saddled horse still remaining in the stable-area, you begin to search the surrounding grove for a second one for yourself to ride on.\n\n\nYou begin to think that your plan might work. It almost does.\n\n\nSomeone calls out to you, voice muffled by the rain. You turn carefully, keeping your face lowered. The voice belongs to a man: a Norman. He has long brown hair, which is plastered to his face by the rain. His beard is thin and pointed, and it too is thick with water.\n\n\nHe smiles at you and waves collegially. You smile thinly back, watching for any sudden movements. At his belt is a sword, but the man\u0027s hands are held carelessly at his side. He takes a step forward and points behind you, speaking quickly in French and smiling. You have no idea what he is saying, but decide to nod. You throw in a smile for good measure, and the Norman replies with more rapid French.\n\n\nHe begins to walk towards you and you place your hand casually on the pommel of your sword, but he merely walks straight past you. You let out a sigh of relief, but then your blood runs cold. Your left hand is still holding the rope. The rope that is currently looped around Catheryn\u0027s hands.\n\n\nYou turn around, and sure enough the Norman has one hand at the front of Catheryn\u0027s dress. He claws awkwardly at it, tearing at the lacing in the front. He half turns and grins at you, showing thick yellow teeth. His eyes flash malevolently.\n\n\nYour hand is already reaching for your sword, but Catheryn strikes first. Tearing her hands free from the loosely tied rope, she draws the dagger from her sleeve and drives it into the man\u0027s back. He gasps thickly, and begins to swing his arms wildly, clutching at his back. You free your sword from its scabbard and decapitate him in one stroke.\n\n\nCatheryn stands rod-still, one hand across her chest, holding up the front of her torn dress, and the other hand gripping the bloody knife. You want to comfort her, but now is not the time. The Norman\u0027s death has not gone unnoticed.\n\n\nThe harsh blue of the Norman kite shields stands out against the thick grey of the rainstorm.

Now!\"\n\n\nYou give yourself one last look, and take them both into your heart and mind. Little Laila with her large blue eyes and red lips now purpled by the cold.\n\n\nCatheryn in her torn and mud-stained dress. Catheryn with her wild tangled hair, matted with dirt and drenched in water. She has never looked so beautiful in your eyes.\n\n\n\"Goodbye\"\n\n\nYou whisper it, and regret not saying it louder. Did they hear? You want to say it again, but there is no time. You must face the threat. You must hold the line. One last time.\n\n\nYou prepare to charge, to charge to your death, but your heart is light. You hear the horse hooves, quickly receding into the shrouding grayness of the rain. Your family has escaped. All is well.\n\n\nYou step forward, and then break into a sprint. With long sword held steady, you charge into Death.\n","page 580":"You hold her close, feeling her warmth under the layers of wet and mud.

You decide to take pity on your hapless son\n\n\n\"I hate to separate the two of you, but Eamon, your mother needs your help looking after your sister\"\n\n\nEamon gives you a grateful nod and slips off, presumably to sneak off with Lynette.
