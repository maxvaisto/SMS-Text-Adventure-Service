Scales rams into Bony, attempting to bite into his flesh, but only actually succeeding in biting bone. Bony rams a fist into Scales\u0027 throat, and he flops to the floor. Shattered Mask, the Super trainer, stands off to the side, watching. He wears parts of a silver mask, somehow attached to his face like a magnet, as well as a black body suit. He rarely speaks, simply watching the violence in front of him.\n\n\nHe walks over to Scales, staring down at him, before shaking his head. Then, he points to you and another girl, whose name you actually know: Thara Richtofen. The German has a reputation for leaving her combatants... less raw then previously. Flames dance around her fists as she steps forward. She has a reputation for being cruel and sadistic. Hopefully, rumors is all they are. Shattered Mask motions for you to to step forward, so you do. Finally, he gives a nod for you to start.\n","page 365":"\"Look for guns!\" you say frantically, looking around quickly.\n\n\nYou keep searching, spotting a pair of pistols hanging from holsters on the wall, just as you hear the other team finally charging inside. You stop and grab it, but Thara tackles you first. Her arms wrap around your chest, as they burst into flames, burning into your flesh and searing your skin. You scream, as your clothes set alight as you scream in pain. You let out a pained scream, collapsing backwards.

The Doctor\u0027s upgrades allow you to compete with the Supers, and you ace all the physical classes. The mental classes are more of a struggle, but you pass them none the less. The only bad part is the Doctor\u0027s \"chores\". Whether it be retrieving DNA samples from toothbrushes, drugging other students, beating up one or two, stealing from both staff and students alike. Still, you do it.\n\n\nThese days quickly turn to weeks, which turn once again to months. Slowly, the year mark creeps up on you, and with that, graduation. \n\n\nYou find that the constant augmentations at the hands of the Doctor change you in more than one way. Your hormone changes lead to mood swings, and find that you want to distance yourself from others, including your room mates. The amount of people you know quickly falls down to one, that fucking Doctor. There\u0027s hints that the final exam for each student is personalized by Mr DeVont, and you know what yours will be. You\u0027re not a sharpshooter, you\u0027re not a spy, you\u0027re not a soldier, you\u0027re a super-powered fighter.

You charge forward, sweeping one\u0027s legs away as you jab another in the throat with the electro-sword, causing them to shudder under the coursing electricity. They collapse backwards, before you see Shada stumble backwards as the edge of her shirt sets alight, which she quickly pats out. Thara charges for you, and you duck out of the way, stabbing her in the back of the head as she collapses to the ground. She twirls around, firing a jet of flames at you, and you dive out of the way. She stands over you, growling as her fists burst into flames. Suddenly, she collapses forward as you hear a gunshot. She yells in pain, before she\u0027s hit half a dozen more times. The other students are quickly shot down as they\u0027re sent stumbling to the ground as Seamus fires dozens of rubber bullets from his assault rifle. Seamus shoots them all once more for efforts, before smiling.\n\n\n\"Well, I rescued you all. You\u0027re welcome. Good ol\u0027 Seamus is amazing,\" Seamus says, smiling.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s go check on Luc,\" you say.\n\n\nYou quickly hurry outside the building, running down to Luc.

You hit one of the charging men, before setting your sights on a German Officer. You pull the trigger, but before the bullet can even leave the barrel, everything goes black. You grab your helmet, pulling it off, revealing the large, empty VR room you\u0027re in. Sergeant Doyle leans against the doorway, grinning.\n\n\n\"World War I? How boring. At least you weren\u0027t so banal to do World War II. You want an interesting VR simulation you should do Russian Civil War. Those battles are fun. Still, you\u0027re not a bad shot.

My name is Alexander Maximov.\"\n\n\n\"What do you do?\"\n\n\n\"Hmm... interesting question. There\u0027s a lot of answers I could give you, but at its core, I\u0027m a force of change.\"\n\n\n\"No offense, but that sounds like a bullshit answer,\" you say\n\n\nMaximov cracks a smile.\n\n\n\"I suppose you\u0027re right. I look at the world, and I\u0027m disgusted. We have billionaires spending their money on private plans and yachts while people starve. We sell massive amounts of gold, which is less useful than tinfoil, but not enough bread to feed the world. It\u0027s simple. The people are manipulated by the upper class. The billionaires of the world spend pennies on propaganda campaigns to convince them that the money is in the hands of the starving immigrants. I want to change that. I want to take control, to allow socialism to prosper once and for all, to allow freedoms to be preserved, to stop the exploitation, to protect the environment.\"\n\n\n\"You\u0027re a dictator?\" Luc asks.\n\n\n\"I prefer the term autocrat, but I won\u0027t bat around the bush. Look at democracy. We don\u0027t elect people because they\u0027re good leaders, we elect them because they\u0027re likeable. The perfect president probably never even got into politics because he had a high pitched voice and a fat face. Half of Americans believe that some magic sky man created them all. Ten percent don\u0027t want to be injected with the vaccines that will save lives. When my TV breaks, I don\u0027t take a vote on what I should do. I call an expert. Some people are experts in repairing TVs. Some are experts in making financial decisions for companies. Some are experts in leading countries.\"\n\n\n\"So... what do you need from us?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"The position is simply. I\u0027m willing to pay you five hundred thousand dollars a year, each, with perks such as a company car, free healthcare and dental and we\u0027ll pay for all your travel, accommodation, further training, weapons and equipment. These wages will increase slowly over time. In exchange, you\u0027ll complete various missions from me. Enemies of mine will be killed, kidnapped or blackmailed. The pesky Supers who stand against me, many of which who are the sons and daughters of the one percent, I may add, will be convinced, killed or kidnapped. I have a lot I need done. The destruction of a Saudi Arabian pipeline would help increase my power through my control over Alaskan and Texan Oil Rigs, and take from the rich Saudi Arabian oil barons. \n\n\n\"Can we have a moment to think it over?\" Luc asks.\n\n\n\"Take your time.\"\n\n\nMaximov strolls out of the room, followed by Sgt Doyle, leaving you all alone.\n\n\n\"So, what are we saying?\" Luc asks. \"He seems like he has reasonable morals.\"\n\n\n\"Fuck the morals!

Slightly farther are firearms, loaded with salt-round.

You don\u0027t know him well on a personal scale, but he has a reputation. Whilst he has super-human strength, his nickname comes from his other super power, the ability to spit a powerful acid, which quickly gave rise to his nickname, Sulfuric. Facing him would quickly make you little more than a puddle after you\u0027re drenched in his spit. You scroll down further, finding a more suitable name: Daniel Lyons.\n\n\nDaniel Lyons is perfect for two reasons. Firstly, he\u0027s skinny, slow and not particularly intelligent, and  was only given a position in the academy because he was an expert shot, which shouldn\u0027t be an issue as long as you strike quickly. and prevent him from reaching the guns. Secondly, he\u0027s a massive prick. He\u0027s mean, snarky and if the rumors are to be believed, he\u0027s attempted to get \"handsy\" with the girls more than a few times in only a week, but this pattern was quickly broken when he tried sticking his hands down the pants of a girl with ice powers, and ended up nearly losing his nose from frostbite.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have an exam today!\" Dead Eye shouts from outside.\n\n\nYou rub the sleep from your eyes and slowly roll out of bed. The others are all there, having gone to bed much earlier than you. You\u0027ve a weird sensation from the shot you took, but other than that, you\u0027re fine. You roll out of bed, standing up and heading down to the showers. You strip down, shower and get a clean pair of clothes from the lockers. Finally, you head down to the cafeteria, and grab a tray. Scrambled eggs and streaky bacon is slapped onto your tray, and you smile.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re all getting good food today,\" Dead Eye yells from the edge of the room. \"Make the competition fair and all. When you\u0027re finished, head to the area and we\u0027ll get started.\"\n\n\nYou sit down at the edge of your group\u0027s table, and quickly devour your meal. You suck the scrambled egg down before cramming the bacon down your throat. Finally, you head to the arena down at the training zone. You head quickly along, until you reach it. Students are sitting up in the bleachers, while the arena has been prepared below. There\u0027s a large circle about thirty feet wide, with two large dots on either end for the people to stand with. A tray of \"swords\" with handles and long, cylindrical stun bits, stand slightly away. The combatants could easily run to it, but that\u0027d leave them at a disadvantage while your opponent is hot at your heels. Further down is a rack of weapons, no doubt loaded with some non-lethal bullet substitute like rubber bullets or stun pellets... well, HOPEFULLY loaded with some non-lethal substitute. The teachers are all standing there in the center, watching as the people file in. You take a seat among Luc, Seamus and Shada, who are watching the arena intently.\n\n\n\"Hey, Mia, you OK?\" Luc asks.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you reply.\n\n\nYou sit down, watching the arena as the last few people file in. Finally, Mr DeVont steps forward, grabbing a microphone. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are here today to test which of you deserve to get through. Some of you will succeed, and others fail. Such is the nature of Prometheus Academy. The exam is simple. You start in this circle on the dot with your opponent on the other. We ring a bell, and you fight. You can try grab a weapon, or fight hand-to-hand. The rules are simple: No attacking anyone in the crowd or any of the teachers, no leaving the arena, and no attempting to kill your opponent. Once they\u0027re knocked out, leave them be. If they surrender, leave them be. If not... use whatever force is necessary. All, right, let\u0027s start... we have Luc Petit and Ford Winchester.\"\n\n\nLuc winces, and stands up.\n\n\n\"Good luck,\" you say, as Seamus and Shada echo similar comments. \n\n\nYou watch as Luc walks down, alongside a tall Super you vaguely recognize. They take their positions at opposite ends of the circle, their fists raised. The teachers slowly exit the arena, except for the Doctor, who stands to the side, presumably to give medical attention to them after the match. He slowly takes out a bell, and rings it.\n\n\nFord barrels forward, removing with super-speed. Luc swings his fist, but Ford ducks easily, and jabs him in the jaw. Luc stumbles backwards before launching a kick, which Ford skips over and punches him in the end a few times again. Luc quickly backpedals, but once again Ford is faster, kicking his legs away so Luc collapses on his back. Ford swipes by for another few hits, but Luc kicks him in the gut by pure luck, sending Ford sprawling. Ford quickly hops up, his fists raised, but Luc manages to stand again. Ford speeds by and swings what he assumes is a killing blow to Luc\u0027s stomach. Luc doubles over but reaches a massive, muscled hand forward and grabs Ford\u0027s throat. He lifts Ford into the air, who turns desperate and scared. Ford quickly begins striking Luc in the back of the head in an attempt to get him to let go, but Luc holds tough, beginning to choke Ford. He lifts him up and flings him against the ground. Ford slams into the hardwood floor, and Luc stomps on his gut before kicking him in the head. Ford sprawls out, unconscious as teeth roll across the floor. The Doctor strolls forward, drawing a syringe, which he jabs into Ford\u0027s neck and pushes down on the plunger. He says something you can\u0027t hear to Luc, and carries Ford off. \n\n\nLuc stumbles towards the seats, where he finds his place with you and your friends. He slumps into his seat with a groan.\n\n\n\"Shit... everything\u0027s fuzzy,\" he mutters.\n\n\n\"Good job,\" you say, patting him on the back.\n\n\nMore people go through the same thing, with the Supers winning for the most part. Most move instantly to hand-to-hand combat, with a few being tackled and taken out while running for weapons. The few who manage to grab weapons tend to win for the most part. Finally, you hear a name you recognize.\n\n\n\" Eka Rahmadia vs Shada Melik,\" the Doctor announces. \n\n\nShada nods eagerly as she hops from her seat. She quickly makes her way tot he middle as a well-built student with a bionic leg makes his way to the middle. The bell rings, and the pair immediately launch into an attack. Shada\u0027s quicker, immediately sending a flying kick straight into Eka\u0027s... obvious week spot. He doubles over and jabs at her throat, but she dodges. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s under prepared for the fight, as Shada jabs him in the throat. He splutters, and Shada slams her fist into the side of his head. He collapses backwards as Shada launches a kick at his head, leaving him clutching his face and groaning.\n\n\n\"Ah... fuck,\" he moans.\n\n\nThe doctor strides forward with a new syringe, jabbing it into Eka\u0027s arm. Eka slumps over, and the Doctor drags him off. There\u0027s another period of fights, one that was quite spectacular as a fire-based Super and an ice-based Super fight, which ends with a lot of frost-burn, literal burn  and a growing puddle of water on the floor. Finally, they get to another name.\n\n\n\"Seamus O\u0027Riley vs Joanna Grayson,\" the Doctor announces.\n\n\n\"Oh sweet merciful fuck,\" Seamus mutters.\n\n\nYou watch as a large Super rises with a blood-thirsty look on her face. Seamus nervously walks into the center of the arena, taking his position, as does Grayson. The bell rings, and you watch as bone plates form from Joanna\u0027s skin. Seamus loudly swears as the the bone-armored student charges towards him. He jumps out of the way of a punch, before having his leg grabbed and being swung against the floor. He yells as he kicks her in the chest repeatedly, but she just stares at him, smiling. She swings a bone fist at him, slamming into his head and sending him flying into the melee weapons table. He collapses on the ground, panting, as Grayson slowly strides towards him. He grabs a wooden club and stands, swinging it at her head with such force that it breaks over her bone forehead.\n\n\n\"Ah, for fuck\u0027s...\" he starts, before being punched in the stomach and flying across the room, sending melee weapons everywhere.\n\n\nHe slowly crawls over to an electro-sword, grabbing it\u0027s handle and flicking the electricity on as it courses through the dull metal pole that acts as the blade. Grayson charges, her fists raised, as Seamus desperately jabs his weapon forward. Grayson doesn\u0027t even bother to bat it away as it bounces off her chest. The pole is deflected, and sent quickly into Grayson\u0027s mouth and down her throat. Seamus presses down on the electricity switch as Grayson twitches, choking as electricity courses through her. She collapses on her back as Seamus eagerly scurries away. The Doctor strides forward, watching as Grayson twitches. He stands there, watching as she chokes out.\n\n\n\"Doctor Griffith!\" Mr DeVont says.\n\n\n\"Yes?\" the Doctor asks, staring as Grayson as she slowly dies.\n\n\n\"Save the fucking girl, Griffith!\" Mr DeVont shouts, exasperated for the first time.\n\n\nThe Doctor sighs, grabbing the handle of the blade and turning off the electricity and yanking the blade out. Grayson doesn\u0027t move, but you can\u0027t tell whether she\u0027s dead or unconscious. The Doctor grabs her by the arm and slowly drags her out of the arena. He arrives minutes later, adn gives a nod to Mr DeVont for the exams to continue.\n","page 233":"The first class of the day is Hand-to-Hand Combat, with Dead-Eye instructing. You watch as one student ducks under another\u0027s swing, before stepping up and head-butting him. He collapses onto the ground, clutching his nose, as Dead-Eye nods.\n\n\n\"Good. The head is as much of a weapon as the fists and feet.Do whatever it takes to win. Go for the eyes, throat and crotch next time, that fight could\u0027ve been over sooner.

You manage to destroy several mannequins and dummies, all wearing crimson capes to take advantage of your angry need for vengeance.\n\n\nYou duck under a holographic sword, jabbing your blade into a chink in the nights armor and hearing a satisfying squelch of blood, before dodging an arrow. You sidestep a flying spear, and get into position to take out a charging nobleman. Suddenly, the room goes dark. You grab your helmet, pulling it off, revealing the large, empty VR room you\u0027re in. Sergeant Doyle leans against the doorway, grinning.\n\n\n\"Knights? You went with Knights? How boring. You want an interesting VR simulation you should do Aztec-Conquistador. Those battles are fun.\"\n\n\n\"Hey, Doyle. How are you?\"\n\n\n\"That\u0027s Mister Doyle to you. Or sergeant.

You place the headset back on the rack and the VR \"sword\" back in it\u0027s sheath, and begin heading to bed.\n","page 232":"When you come tol, you\u0027re still lying on the operating table. You have dozens of stitches across your chest, where the Doctor presumably operated on you. The Doctor stands in the corner, washing his instruments in medical alcohol.\n\n\n\"Did it work?\" \n\n\n\"Yes,\" the Doctor says, not even turning to look at you. \"It\u0027s past midnight.

There\u0027s a few guards stationed, but none of them bother you, presumably on orders from the Doctor. You arrive at your dorm, and push open the door. Luc snores loudly from his bunk, Seamus is sprawled out across his bed while Shada is fast asleep in her bed. You climb into your bed, lying down, quickly falling asleep.\n","page 353":"\"D!\" you shout.\n\n\nSeamus nods and quickly turns heel and rushes off, while you, Luc and Shada charge them, your fists raised with a roar. You burst forward, ducking under a burst of flames before a punch goes for your chest. You dodge it, punching Thara in the side of the head. She stumbles backwards, and you punch her in the stomach, then the head three times. She stumbles, but quickly regains her footing position, although she\u0027s bleeding badly from her nose. You watch as Luc flings a girl to the floor head-first, before Thara turns and engulfs him in flames, as he drops to the ground with a scream. It\u0027s now two versus four, with another student quickly approaching Shada to take her down. You need to make a choice.\n","page 114":"You quickly scan the room. You can search through the desk, check the trophy rack for hints or check the pictures.\n","page 235":"You back-step, avoiding his swings easily.

Are you in there?\" Dead Eye shouts from the doorway, popping his head in the door.\n\n\n\"Should I be worried how quick you are to stare in the door of a bathroom for teenage girls?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no, I\u0027m not... I\u0027m not into...\" he says, awkwardly stumbling over his words. \"Just shut up and get out of here.\"\n\n\nYou walk outside, as Dead Eye looks at you.\n\n\n\"Your speed was off-the charts for a normal. Is there a reason behind that?\"\n\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"I know. I think we\u0027ve made a mistake. I believe you have dormant powers,\" he says.\n\n\n\"Uh... yeah, maybe.\"\n\n\n\"I want you to head to Doctor Griffith\u0027s for an examination.

You\u0027ll wake up without your... anything.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks for the advice,\" you say.\n\n\n\"Now, go along,\" Dead Eye says. \"I have a class to teach.\"\n\n\nYou walk off, strolling back towards the arena. You quickly walk along to the Medical Station, where the Doctor is waiting.\n\n\n\"Ah, Mia. How can I help you?\"\n\n\n\"I was sent here by Dead-Eye. He wants me tested for powers.\"\n\n\n\"I don\u0027t make misakes. You should have incredible powers. My procedures have done their part. You performed well. If you performed so well that Dead-Eye picked up on the powers, you\u0027ve done very well. I need a job done, by the way.\" \n\n\n\"What?\" you ask nervously.\n\n\n\"Yuraf Hussein. He\u0027s a seventeen year old student here. He\u0027ll be expelled any day now. for his crass and rude behavior, but his body is... I need you to coat his retainer in this.\"\n\n\nDoctor Griffith takes out a small bottle of an unknown liquid, handing it to you.\n\n\n\"Why?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"His room is in Dorm 13. His bed is first on the right, top bunk. Get it done and your debt to me is finished. We won\u0027t have to talk again. Now, are you going to get it done?\"\n\n\n\"Fine. I\u0027ll do it.\"\n\n\n\"Good. An intelligent decision. When it\u0027s done, dump the bottle in the right bin in the cafeteria, and I\u0027ll get rid of it. We never discuss this again... unless you fail to get it done.\"\n\n\nYou nod, as the Doctor quickly turns and walks off. You turn and begin walking towards Dorm 13. Most students are busy training for tomorrow, so the hallways are empty. You walk quickly, reaching the wooden door emblazoned with a small, steel \"13\". Your knuckles rap lightly against the door,  before you open it. The room\u0027s empty, so you quickly walk inside. You quickly head to your target\u0027s bunk, and find a small, blue, half-circle-shaped box sitting half-hidden under the pillow. You pick it up, opening it. You wince at the sight of saliva-encrusted retainer. You take out the bottle, quickly unscrew it and poor a small amount of a colorless liquid onto the retainer, where it mingles with the saliva. It\u0027s hard enough to see, and you highly doubt Yuraf will notice. You pour on another few drips for good measure, and pop them back in the container. You quickly slide out of the room, and begin walking down the hallway. You hear the bell ringing, signifying the start of your next class. You struggle to remember what class you have now, before remembering anticipating having to do climbing exercises. That\u0027ll be easy, thanks to your newfound powers. That\u0027ll probably be your new life for the time being. Absolutely killing all the physical classes thanks to your new powers, and still doing well in the mental classes, because you weren\u0027t half bad to begin with. Still, this time will be peppered with incidents of the Doctor\u0027s dirty work, whatever it may be. It\u0027s a life, at least.\n","page 356":"Fuck, if you stay here, you\u0027re dead. You slam your heel into the girl trying to kill Shada, knocking her back.\n\n\n\"Let\u0027s get to Seamus!\" you yell.\n\n\nShe nods, and you both turn, sprinting off.\n\n\nThere\u0027s silence besides the heavy footsteps on the wooden floor, before that silence is broken by a scream. You turn your head slightly, seeing Shada collapse as she\u0027s engulfed by a stream of flames sent by Thara. You feel the heat on your back and yelp as your shirt sets alight. You stumble, before rolling to the floor as you\u0027re completely overtaken by the fire. Thara grabs your head gleefully, firing her flames at full blast. You scream as your skull begins to melt, your skin char and thankfully, your brain doesn\u0027t last more than a second or two.\n","page 113":"\"Wake up! Ladies and gentlemen, we have an exam today!\" Dead Eye shouts from outside.\n\n\nYou rub the sleep from your eyes and slowly roll out of bed. The others are all there, having gone to bed much earlier than you. You shoulder still hurts a bit from the recoil of the rifles, but you say you\u0027re fine. You roll out of bed, standing up and heading down to the showers. You strip down, shower and get a clean pair of clothes from the lockers. Finally, you head down to the cafeteria, and grab a tray. Scrambled eggs and streaky bacon is slapped onto your tray, and you smile.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re all getting good food today,\" Dead Eye yells from the edge of the room. \"Make the competition fair and all. When you\u0027re finished, head to the area and we\u0027ll get started.\"\n\n\nYou sit down at the edge of your group\u0027s table, and quickly devour your meal. You suck the scrambled egg down before cramming the bacon down your throat. Finally, you head to the arena down at the training zone. You head quickly along, until you reach it. Students are sitting up in the bleachers, while the arena has been prepared below. There\u0027s a large circle about thirty feet wide, with two large dots on either end for the people to stand with. A tray of \"swords\" with handles and long, cylindrical stun bits, stand slightly away. The combatants could easily run to it, but that\u0027d leave them at a disadvantage while your opponent is hot at your heels. Further down is a rack of weapons, no doubt loaded with some non-lethal bullet substitute like rubber bullets or stun pellets... well, HOPEFULLY loaded with some non-lethal substitute. The teachers are all standing there in the center, watching as the people file in. You take a seat among Luc, Seamus and Shada, who are watching the arena intently.\n\n\n\"Hey, Mia, you OK?\" Luc asks.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you reply.\n\n\nYou sit down, watching the arena as the last few people file in. Finally, Mr DeVont steps forward, grabbing a microphone. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are here today to test which of you deserve to get through. Some of you will succeed, and others fail. Such is the nature of Prometheus Academy. The exam is simple. You start in this circle on the dot with your opponent on the other. We ring a bell, and you fight. You can try grab a weapon, or fight hand-to-hand. The rules are simple: No attacking anyone in the crowd or any of the teachers, no leaving the arena, and no attempting to kill your opponent. Once they\u0027re knocked out, leave them be. If they surrender, leave them be. If not... use whatever force is necessary. All, right, let\u0027s start... we have Luc Petit and Ford Winchester.\"\n\n\nLuc winces, and stands up.\n\n\n\"Good luck,\" you say, as Seamus and Shada echo similar comments.\n\n\nYou watch as Luc walks down, alongside a tall Super you vaguely recognize. They take their positions at opposite ends of the circle, their fists raised. The teachers slowly exit the arena, except for the Doctor, who stands to the side, presumably to give medical attention to them after the match. He slowly takes out a bell, and rings it.\n\n\nFord barrels forward, removing with super-speed. Luc swings his fist, but Ford ducks easily, and jabs him in the jaw. Luc stumbles backwards before launching a kick, which Ford skips over and punches him in the end a few times again. Luc quickly backpedals, but once again Ford is faster, kicking his legs away so Luc collapses on his back. Ford swipes by for another few hits, but Luc kicks him in the gut by pure luck, sending Ford sprawling. Ford quickly hops up, his fists raised, but Luc manages to stand again. Ford speeds by and swings what he assumes is a killing blow to Luc\u0027s stomach. Luc doubles over but reaches a massive, muscled hand forward and grabs Ford\u0027s throat. He lifts Ford into the air, who turns desperate and scared. Ford quickly begins striking Luc in the back of the head in an attempt to get him to let go, but Luc holds tough, beginning to choke Ford. He lifts him up and flings him against the ground. Ford slams into the hardwood floor, and Luc stomps on his gut before kicking him in the head. Ford sprawls out, unconscious as teeth roll across the floor. The Doctor strolls forward, drawing a syringe, which he jabs into Ford\u0027s neck and pushes down on the plunger. He says something you can\u0027t hear to Luc, and carries Ford off. \n\n\nLuc stumbles towards the seats, where he finds his place with you and your friends. He slumps into his seat with a groan.\n\n\n\"Shit... everything\u0027s fuzzy,\" he mutters.\n\n\n\"Good job,\" you say, patting him on the back.\n\n\nMore people go through the same thing, with the Supers winning for the most part. Most move instantly to hand-to-hand combat, with a few being tackled and taken out while running for weapons. The few who manage to grab weapons tend to win for the most part. Finally, you hear a name you recognize.\n\n\n\" Eka Rahmadia vs Shada Melik,\" the Doctor announces. \n\n\nShada nods eagerly as she hops from her seat. She quickly makes her way tot he middle as a well-built student with a bionic leg makes his way to the middle. The bell rings, and the pair immediately launch into an attack. Shada\u0027s quicker, immediately sending a flying kick straight into Eka\u0027s... obvious week spot. He doubles over and jabs at her throat, but she dodges. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s under prepared for the fight, as Shada jabs him in the throat. He splutters, and Shada slams her fist into the side of his head. He collapses backwards as Shada launches a kick at his head, leaving him clutching his face and groaning.\n\n\n\"Ah... fuck,\" he moans.\n\n\nThe doctor strides forward with a new syringe, jabbing it into Eka\u0027s arm. Eka slumps over, and the Doctor drags him off. There\u0027s another period of fights, one that was quite spectacular as a fire-based Super and an ice-based Super fight, which ends with a lot of frost-burn, literal burn  and a growing puddle of water on the floor. Finally, they get to another name.\n\n\n\"Seamus O\u0027Riley vs Joanna Grayson,\" the Doctor announces.\n\n\n\"Oh sweet merciful fuck,\" Seamus mutters.\n\n\nYou watch as a large Super rises with a blood-thirsty look on her face. Seamus nervously walks into the center of the arena, taking his position, as does Grayson. The bell rings, and you watch as bone plates form from Joanna\u0027s skin. Seamus loudly swears as the the bone-armored student charges towards him. He jumps out of the way of a punch, before having his leg grabbed and being swung against the floor. He yells as he kicks her in the chest repeatedly, but she just stares at him, smiling. She swings a bone fist at him, slamming into his head and sending him flying into the melee weapons table. He collapses on the ground, panting, as Grayson slowly strides towards him. He grabs a wooden club and stands, swinging it at her head with such force that it breaks over her bone forehead.\n\n\n\"Ah, for fuck\u0027s...\" he starts, before being punched in the stomach and flying across the room, sending melee weapons everywhere.\n\n\nHe slowly crawls over to an electro-sword, grabbing it\u0027s handle and flicking the electricity on as it courses through the dull metal pole that acts as the blade. Grayson charges, her fists raised, as Seamus desperately jabs his weapon forward. Grayson doesn\u0027t even bother to bat it away as it bounces off her chest. The pole is deflected, and sent quickly into Grayson\u0027s mouth and down her throat. Seamus presses down on the electricity switch as Grayson twitches, choking as electricity courses through her. She collapses on her back as Seamus eagerly scurries away. The Doctor strides forward, watching as Grayson twitches. He stands there, watching as she chokes out.\n\n\n\"Doctor Griffith!\" Mr DeVont says.\n\n\n\"Yes?\" the Doctor asks, staring as Grayson as she slowly dies.\n\n\n\"Save the fucking girl, Griffith!\" Mr DeVont shouts, exasperated for the first time.\n\n\nThe Doctor sighs, grabbing the handle of the blade and turning off the electricity and yanking the blade out. Grayson doesn\u0027t move, but you can\u0027t tell whether she\u0027s dead or unconscious. The Doctor grabs her by the arm and slowly drags her out of the arena. He arrives minutes later, and gives a nod to Mr DeVont for the exams to continue.\n","page 234":"Gu steps forward, swinging quickly. You see him arching his back for a punch, and easily sidestep his punch.He brings his knee up but you simply step back, before grabbing his leg and yanking it out from under him. He falls to the ground, before hopping up again. He charges you full force, swinging both fists, you duck, before launching several quick punches to his face with all of your strength. His nose explodes like a ripe tomato as blood spurts out. He yells in pain, as he stumbles back. You punch again, and again, smashing into his face as he collapses to the ground.\n\n\n\"Stop, stop! Jesus Christ, Mia! He\u0027s had enough,\" Dead Eye shouts, grabbing you by the shoulder.\n\n\nThe adrenaline rush ends, and the resultant anger fades with it.

One of them shows a Mr DeVont with a group of similarly dressed businessmen at a meeting. Small, handwritten numbers at the bottom read \"4th of December, 2004\". The second shows Mr DeVont standing next to a painting of the Mona Lisa. Finally, there\u0027s a picture of a silk worm hanging in the foreground of the picture, and a wolf howls in the background.\n","page 238":"The next few days are similar. The Doctor\u0027s upgrades allow you to compete with the Supers, and you ace all the physical classes. The mental classes are more of a struggle, but you pass them none the less. The only bad part is the Doctor\u0027s \"chores\". Whether it be retrieving DNA samples from toothbrushes, drugging other students, beating up one or two, stealing from both staff and students alike. Still, you do it.\n\n\nThese days quickly turn to weeks, which turn once again to months. Slowly, the year mark creeps up on you, and with that, graduation. \n\n\nYou find that the constant augmentations at the hands of the Doctor change you in more than one way. Your hormone changes lead to mood swings, and find that you want to distance yourself from others, including your room mates. The amount of people you know quickly falls down to one, that fucking Doctor. There\u0027s hints that the final exam for each student is personalized by Mr DeVont, and you know what yours will be. You\u0027re not a sharpshooter, you\u0027re not a spy, you\u0027re not a soldier, you\u0027re a super-powered fighter. You focus almost entirely on melee, fighting with the other Supers to prepare.\n","page 359":"Sheep\n\n\nLife is hard. As you adapt to your new life in the foster home, you realize you don’t like it. You don’t want a normal, bland job. You find school hard and boring. You can’t play sports because of your injuries, and being called “Eypatch” doesn’t help your reputation with guys. You just continue life. \n","page 88":"It\u0027s a long week, but an important one. You quickly find yourself picking up new skills and abilities.

You\u0027ve learned a lot about the people here. The guards for the most part tend to be all career criminals who have worked for Mr DeVont. The students have all formed various cliques. The normals, left without power, have for the most part made friends with the other people in their room, and make up most of the cafeteria. There\u0027s also some normals sitting at the edges, who are either pathetic loners or hard, antisocial bastards who look like they chew metal and spit acid, as well as a few people who flitter from group to group.

That would give you better chances tomorrow. You could try to find some of that fantastic, miraculous serum that the Doctor gave you, which could give you a serious boost in tomorrow\u0027s test. Finally, you could attempt to find some way to get out of the test, to a degree. You could very easily sneak into Mr DeVont\u0027s office, switch around a few names, and make it so that you\u0027re up against Sissy McWimperson instead of some monstrosity that\u0027s only referred to as \"It\". \n","page 240":"\"My face was badly burned,\" you lie, in a weak attempt to disguise your voice. \"In a fight with a fire-Super.\"\n\n\n\"Is it bad?\" Elisio asks.\n\n\n\"Yeah.

You turn, jogging out, and heading to the bathroom Doctor Griffith told you about. You yank your ski mask off and toss it into the bin, before splashing water on your face.

He lets out a cough and spits mucus on the ground, before taking another drag.\n\n\n\"Oh, I am too young for a cough like that,\" Seamus complains, before passing out the cigarettes. \"Mia, do you want one?

We never discuss this again... unless you fail to get it done.\"\n\n\nYou nod, as the Doctor quickly turns and walks off. You turn and begin walking towards Dorm 13. Most students are busy training for tomorrow, so the hallways are empty. You walk quickly, reaching the wooden door emblazoned with a small, steel \"13\". Your knuckles rap lightly against the door,  before you open it. The room\u0027s empty, so you quickly walk inside. You quickly head to your target\u0027s bunk, and find a small, blue, half-circle-shaped box sitting half-hidden under the pillow. You pick it up, opening it. You wince at the sight of saliva-encrusted retainer. You take out the bottle, quickly unscrew it and poor a small amount of a colorless liquid onto the retainer, where it mingles with the saliva. It\u0027s hard enough to see, and you highly doubt Yuraf will notice. You pour on another few drips for good measure, and pop them back in the container. You quickly slide out of the room, and begin walking down the hallway. \n\n\n\"This will keep the terrifying bastard off your back,\" you mutter to yourself, walking along the hallway.\n\n\nIt\u0027s been a long week.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have an exam today!\" Void shouts from outside.\n\n\nYou rub the sleep from your eyes and slowly roll out of bed. The others are all there, having gone to bed much earlier than you. You\u0027ve had a great night\u0027s rest, and you\u0027re feeling confident. Hell, you could take out a prick like Daniel Lyons in your sleep. You roll out of bed, standing up and heading down to the showers. You strip down, shower and get a clean pair of clothes from the lockers. Finally, you head down to the cafeteria, and grab a tray. Scrambled eggs and streaky bacon is slapped onto your tray, and you smile.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re all getting good food today,\" Void yells from the edge of the room. \"Make the competition fair and all. When you\u0027re finished, head to the area and we\u0027ll get started.\"\n\n\nYou sit down at the edge of your group\u0027s table, and quickly devour your meal. You suck the scrambled egg down before cramming the bacon down your throat. Finally, you head to the arena down at the training zone. You head quickly along, until you reach it. Students are sitting up in the bleachers, while the arena has been prepared below. There\u0027s a large circle about thirty feet wide, with two large dots on either end for the people to stand with. A tray of \"swords\" with handles and long, cylindrical stun bits, stand slightly away. The combatants could easily run to it, but that\u0027d leave them at a disadvantage while your opponent is hot at your heels. Further down is a rack of weapons, no doubt loaded with some non-lethal bullet substitute like rubber bullets or stun pellets... well, HOPEFULLY loaded with some non-lethal substitute. The teachers are all standing there in the center, watching as the people file in. You take a seat among Luc, Seamus and Shada, who are watching the arena intently.\n\n\n\"Hey, Mia, you OK?\" Luc asks.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you reply.\n\n\nYou sit down, watching the arena as the last few people file in. Finally, Mr DeVont steps forward, grabbing a microphone. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are here today to test which of you deserve to get through. Some of you will succeed, and others fail. Such is the nature of Prometheus Academy. The exam is simple. You start in this circle on the dot with your opponent on the other. We ring a bell, and you fight. You can try grab a weapon, or fight hand-to-hand. The rules are simple: No attacking anyone in the crowd or any of the teachers, no leaving the arena, and no attempting to kill your opponent. Once they\u0027re knocked out, leave them be. If they surrender, leave them be. If not... use whatever force is necessary. All, right, let\u0027s start... we have Luc Petit and Ford Winchester.\"\n\n\nLuc winces, and stands up.\n\n\n\"Good luck,\" you say, as Seamus and Shada echo similar comments. \n\n\nYou watch as Luc walks down, alongside a tall Super you vaguely recognize. They take their positions at opposite ends of the circle, their fists raised. The teachers slowly exit the arena, except for the Doctor, who stands to the side, presumably to give medical attention to them after the match. He slowly takes out a bell, and rings it.\n\n\nFord barrels forward, removing with super-speed. Luc swings his fist, but Ford ducks easily, and jabs him in the jaw. Luc stumbles backwards before launching a kick, which Ford skips over and punches him in the end a few times again. Luc quickly backpedals, but once again Ford is faster, kicking his legs away so Luc collapses on his back. Ford swipes by for another few hits, but Luc kicks him in the gut by pure luck, sending Ford sprawling. Ford quickly hops up, his fists raised, but Luc manages to stand again. Ford speeds by and swings what he assumes is a killing blow to Luc\u0027s stomach. Luc doubles over but reaches a massive, muscled hand forward and grabs Ford\u0027s throat. He lifts Ford into the air, who turns desperate and scared. Ford quickly begins striking Luc in the back of the head in an attempt to get him to let go, but Luc holds tough, beginning to choke Ford. He lifts him up and flings him against the ground. Ford slams into the hardwood floor, and Luc stomps on his gut before kicking him in the head. Ford sprawls out, unconscious as teeth roll across the floor. The Doctor strolls forward, drawing a syringe, which he jabs into Ford\u0027s neck and pushes down on the plunger. He says something you can\u0027t hear to Luc, and carries Ford off. \n\n\nLuc stumbles towards the seats, where he finds his place with you and your friends. He slumps into his seat with a groan.\n\n\n\"Shit... everything\u0027s fuzzy,\" he mutters.\n\n\n\"Good job,\" you say, patting him on the back.\n\n\nMore people go through the same thing, with the Supers winning for the most part. Most move instantly to hand-to-hand combat, with a few being tackled and taken out while running for weapons. The few who manage to grab weapons tend to win for the most part. Finally, you hear a name you recognize.\n\n\n\" Eka Rahmadia vs Shada Melik,\" the Doctor announces. \n\n\nShada nods eagerly as she hops from her seat. She quickly makes her way tot he middle as a well-built student with a bionic leg makes his way to the middle. The bell rings, and the pair immediately launch into an attack. Shada\u0027s quicker, immediately sending a flying kick straight into Eka\u0027s... obvious week spot. He doubles over and jabs at her throat, but she dodges. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s under prepared for the fight, as Shada jabs him in the throat. He splutters, and Shada slams her fist into the side of his head. He collapses backwards as Shada launches a kick at his head, leaving him clutching his face and groaning.\n\n\n\"Ah... fuck,\" he moans.\n\n\nThe doctor strides forward with a new syringe, jabbing it into Eka\u0027s arm. Eka slumps over, and the Doctor drags him off. There\u0027s another period of fights, one that was quite spectacular as a fire-based Super and an ice-based Super fight, which ends with a lot of frost-burn, literal burn  and a growing puddle of water on the floor. Finally, they get to another name.\n\n\n\"Seamus O\u0027Riley vs Joanna Grayson,\" the Doctor announces.\n\n\n\"Oh sweet merciful fuck,\" Seamus mutters.\n\n\nYou watch as a large Super rises with a blood-thirsty look on her face. Seamus nervously walks into the center of the arena, taking his position, as does Grayson. The bell rings, and you watch as bone plates form from Joanna\u0027s skin. Seamus loudly swears as the the bone-armored student charges towards him. He jumps out of the way of a punch, before having his leg grabbed and being swung against the floor. He yells as he kicks her in the chest repeatedly, but she just stares at him, smiling. She swings a bone fist at him, slamming into his head and sending him flying into the melee weapons table. He collapses on the ground, panting, as Grayson slowly strides towards him. He grabs a wooden club and stands, swinging it at her head with such force that it breaks over her bone forehead.\n\n\n\"Ah, for fuck\u0027s...\" he starts, before being punched in the stomach and flying across the room, sending melee weapons everywhere.\n\n\nHe slowly crawls over to an electro-sword, grabbing it\u0027s handle and flicking the electricity on as it courses through the dull metal pole that acts as the blade. Grayson charges, her fists raised, as Seamus desperately jabs his weapon forward. Grayson doesn\u0027t even bother to bat it away as it bounces off her chest. The pole is deflected, and sent quickly into Grayson\u0027s mouth and down her throat. Seamus presses down on the electricity switch as Grayson twitches, choking as electricity courses through her. She collapses on her back as Seamus eagerly scurries away. The Doctor strides forward, watching as Grayson twitches. He stands there, watching as she chokes out.\n\n\n\"Doctor Griffith!\" Mr DeVont says.\n\n\n\"Yes?\" the Doctor asks, staring as Grayson as she slowly dies.\n\n\n\"Save the fucking girl, Griffith!\" Mr DeVont shouts, exasperated for the first time.\n\n\nThe Doctor sighs, grabbing the handle of the blade and turning off the electricity and yanking the blade out. Grayson doesn\u0027t move, but you can\u0027t tell whether she\u0027s dead or unconscious. The Doctor grabs her by the arm and slowly drags her out of the arena. He arrives minutes later, and gives a nod to Mr DeVont for the exams to continue.\n","page 275":"You walk into archery class, only to find Sergeant Doyle standing next to Mr DeVont.\n\n\n\"I want to hear you say it,\" Sergeant Doyle says, before noticing Mia. \"Ah, Mia, good timing.

You take a deep breath, and aim at the humanoid dummy hanging from the commercial drone overhead, set in classic Superman pose. Doyle\u0027s even put a red cape on it. You take aim as it flies past, before firing. The harpoon flies through the air, penetrating the dummy. You drop to a knee, jamming the weapon\u0027s tripod into the ground to stabilize it and putting your full weight on top of it, using your bionic arm to tightly grip the battle to keep it from flying away. The dummy snags as the slack on the harpoon line runs out. You press a button on the side of the weapon, as the line begins to recede inside the device. The dummy is quickly dragged towards the ground, slamming into the soil next to you.

He rolled along the ground, before an explosion slammed him into the wall. He groaned, coughing blood. He tried to stand, but a figure in combat armor charged out, slamming his fist into him and knocking him to the ground. He groaned, looking up at four figures standing above him.

Your eye gazes out at the falling snow as your fingers trace a circle in the air out of boredom. You see a flying object off in the distance. Maybe it\u0027s a plane, or a bird. Maybe it\u0027s him.

You listen as the stairs creek as she walks downstairs. You wait until she\u0027s gone before leaning over and grabbing the plate to inspect your meal: Fish Fingers and Potato Waffles. You eagerly dig in: you\u0027re starving, despite what you said to your newest caretaker. You just don\u0027t want to sit at that big oak table as the other kids go through their days, describing boring interactions with friends and telling stories as banal as the discovery of a dead rat outside their school. You can\u0027t deal with people right now.\n\n\nYou continue staring out the window for some time. What little light the pale winter sun provides is snuffed out by darkness, and once again Gertrude appears at the top of the stairs.\n\n\n\"Mia, it\u0027s time for bed,\" she says, already knowing what the response will be.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m not tired.\"\n\n\n\"Mia, you can\u0027t spend the rest of your life sitting in that chair,\" Gertrude says in a soft, pleading voice. \"Can you just go to bed?\"\n","page 141":"\"I... was cheating on the exam.\"\n\n\n\"Cheating on the exam?

Whilst he has super-human strength, his nickname comes from his other super power, the ability to spit a powerful acid, which quickly gave rise to his nickname, Sulfuric. You\u0027ve often seen signs of his work, holes in metal tables and chairs from spitting. Without a doubt, he\u0027ll be a tough bastard to take down. For fuck\u0027s sake, he\u0027s already gotten the super-villain moniker down to a tee.\n\n\nSulfuric hops up, and eagerly strides down to the arena. You\u0027re going to need to know how to handle him. This will be a hard fight. Any misstep will lead to death. You take your position on your dot in the circle, and raise your fist. You watch as the Doctor readies his bell. You stare at Savian, who has a shaven head, bulging muscles and spit dripping from his jaw onto the floor, where it sizzles as it burns through the wood.\n\n\nThe bell rings.\n","page 288":"You stand at the shooting range, aiming your rifle at the target far down the line.

You sling the rifle over your back. You pick up the assault rifle in front of you, twirling around and fires several bursts of bullets, all of which hit the rapidly approaching targets on a rail. You continue firing until the gun clicks empty, before slinging it over your shoulder again and running forward to the final target, three rapidly moving punching bags. You draw the sawn-off shotgun in your side holster, firing at the first two before dropping it, finally drawing your revolver and unloading it into the third bag.\n\n\n\"22 seconds. Not bad, Mia.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have an exam today!\" Sergeant Doyle shouts from outside.\n\n\nYou rub the sleep from your eyes and slowly roll out of bed. The others are all there, having gone to bed much earlier than you. You roll out of bed, standing up and heading down to the showers. You strip down, shower and get a clean pair of clothes from the lockers. Finally, you head down to the cafeteria, and grab a tray. Scrambled eggs and streaky bacon is slapped onto your tray, and you smile.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re all getting good food today,\" Sergeant Doyle yells from the edge of the room. \"Make the competition fair and all. When you\u0027re finished, head to the area and we\u0027ll get started.\"\n\n\nYou sit down with your friends and begin eating.\n\n\n\"So, how do you think you\u0027ll do in the \"exam\"?\" Seamus asks.\n\n\n\"I\u0027ll really miss you, Shada. I hope whoever you\u0027re up against leaves you alive,\" Shada says, smiling.\n\n\n\"Hey, fuck you!\" Seamus says indignantly.\n\n\n\"We\u0027ll all do fine,\" Luc says.\n\n\nYou suck the scrambled egg down before cramming the bacon down your throat. Finally, you head to the arena down at the training zone. You head quickly along, until you reach it. Students are sitting up in the bleachers, while the arena has been prepared below. There\u0027s a large circle about thirty feet wide, with two large dots on either end for the people to stand with. A tray of \"swords\" with handles and long, cylindrical stun bits, stand slightly away. The combatants could easily run to it, but that\u0027d leave them at a disadvantage while your opponent is hot at your heels. Further down is a rack of weapons, no doubt loaded with some non-lethal bullet substitute like rubber bullets or stun pellets... well, HOPEFULLY loaded with some non-lethal substitute. The teachers are all standing there in the center, watching as the people file in. You take a seat among Luc, Seamus and Shada, who are watching the arena intently.\n\n\n\"Hey, Mia, you OK?\" Luc asks.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" you reply.\n\n\nYou sit down, watching the arena as the last few people file in. Finally, Mr DeVont steps forward, grabbing a microphone. \n\n\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are here today to test which of you deserve to get through. Some of you will succeed, and others fail. Such is the nature of Prometheus Academy. The exam is simple. You start in this circle on the dot with your opponent on the other. We ring a bell, and you fight. You can try grab a weapon, or fight hand-to-hand. The rules are simple: No attacking anyone in the crowd or any of the teachers, no leaving the arena, and no attempting to kill your opponent. Once they\u0027re knocked out, leave them be. If they surrender, leave them be. If not... use whatever force is necessary. All, right, let\u0027s start... we have Luc Petit and Ford Winchester.\"\n\n\nLuc winces, and stands up.\n\n\n\"Good luck,\" you say, as Seamus and Shada echo similar comments. \n\n\nYou watch as Luc walks down, alongside a tall Super you vaguely recognize. They take their positions at opposite ends of the circle, their fists raised. The teachers slowly exit the arena, except for the Doctor, who stands to the side, presumably to give medical attention to them after the match. He slowly takes out a bell, and rings it.\n\n\nFord barrels forward, removing with super-speed. Luc swings his fist, but Ford ducks easily, and jabs him in the jaw. Luc stumbles backwards before launching a kick, which Ford skips over and punches him in the end a few times again. Luc quickly backpedals, but once again Ford is faster, kicking his legs away so Luc collapses on his back. Ford swipes by for another few hits, but Luc kicks him in the gut by pure luck, sending Ford sprawling. Ford quickly hops up, his fists raised, but Luc manages to stand again. Ford speeds by and swings what he assumes is a killing blow to Luc\u0027s stomach. Luc doubles over but reaches a massive, muscled hand forward and grabs Ford\u0027s throat. He lifts Ford into the air, who turns desperate and scared. Ford quickly begins striking Luc in the back of the head in an attempt to get him to let go, but Luc holds tough, beginning to choke Ford. He lifts him up and flings him against the ground. Ford slams into the hardwood floor, and Luc stomps on his gut before kicking him in the head. Ford sprawls out, unconscious as teeth roll across the floor. The Doctor strolls forward, drawing a syringe, which he jabs into Ford\u0027s neck and pushes down on the plunger. He says something you can\u0027t hear to Luc, and carries Ford off. \n\n\nLuc stumbles towards the seats, where he finds his place with you and your friends. He slumps into his seat with a groan.\n\n\n\"Shit... everything\u0027s fuzzy,\" he mutters.\n\n\n\"Good job,\" you say, patting him on the back.\n\n\nMore people go through the same thing, with the Supers winning for the most part. Most move instantly to hand-to-hand combat, with a few being tackled and taken out while running for weapons. The few who manage to grab weapons tend to win for the most part. Finally, you hear a name you recognize.\n\n\n\" Eka Rahmadia vs Shada Melik,\" the Doctor announces. \n\n\nShada nods eagerly as she hops from her seat. She quickly makes her way tot he middle as a well-built student with a bionic leg makes his way to the middle. The bell rings, and the pair immediately launch into an attack. Shada\u0027s quicker, immediately sending a flying kick straight into Eka\u0027s... obvious week spot. He doubles over and jabs at her throat, but she dodges. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s under prepared for the fight, as Shada jabs him in the throat. He splutters, and Shada slams her fist into the side of his head. He collapses backwards as Shada launches a kick at his head, leaving him clutching his face and groaning.\n\n\n\"Ah... fuck,\" he moans.\n\n\nThe doctor strides forward with a new syringe, jabbing it into Eka\u0027s arm. Eka slumps over, and the Doctor drags him off. There\u0027s another period of fights, one that was quite spectacular as a fire-based Super and an ice-based Super fight, which ends with a lot of frost-burn, literal burn  and a growing puddle of water on the floor. Finally, they get to another name.\n\n\n\"Seamus O\u0027Riley vs Joanna Grayson,\" the Doctor announces.\n\n\n\"Oh sweet merciful fuck,\" Seamus mutters.\n\n\nYou watch as a large Super rises with a blood-thirsty look on her face. Seamus nervously walks into the center of the arena, taking his position, as does Grayson. The bell rings, and you watch as bone plates form from Joanna\u0027s skin. Seamus loudly swears as the the bone-armored student charges towards him. He jumps out of the way of a punch, before having his leg grabbed and being swung against the floor. He yells as he kicks her in the chest repeatedly, but she just stares at him, smiling. She swings a bone fist at him, slamming into his head and sending him flying into the melee weapons table. He collapses on the ground, panting, as Grayson slowly strides towards him. He grabs a wooden club and stands, swinging it at her head with such force that it breaks over her bone forehead.\n\n\n\"Ah, for fuck\u0027s...\" he starts, before being punched in the stomach and flying across the room, sending melee weapons everywhere.\n\n\nHe slowly crawls over to an electro-sword, grabbing it\u0027s handle and flicking the electricity on as it courses through the dull metal pole that acts as the blade. Grayson charges, her fists raised, as Seamus desperately jabs his weapon forward. Grayson doesn\u0027t even bother to bat it away as it bounces off her chest. The pole is deflected, and sent quickly into Grayson\u0027s mouth and down her throat. Seamus presses down on the electricity switch as Grayson twitches, choking as electricity courses through her. She collapses on her back as Seamus eagerly scurries away. The Doctor strides forward, watching as Grayson twitches. He stands there, watching as she chokes out.\n\n\n\"Doctor Griffith!\" Mr DeVont says.\n\n\n\"Yes?\" the Doctor asks, staring as Grayson as she slowly dies.\n\n\n\"Save the fucking girl, Griffith!\" Mr DeVont shouts, exasperated for the first time.\n\n\nThe Doctor sighs, grabbing the handle of the blade and turning off the electricity and yanking the blade out. Grayson doesn\u0027t move, but you can\u0027t tell whether she\u0027s dead or unconscious. The Doctor grabs her by the arm and slowly drags her out of the arena. He arrives minutes later, and gives a nod to Mr DeVont for the exams to continue.\n","page 287":"\"Come on, for fuck\u0027s sake! How the fuck do you expect to take out a flyboy if you can\u0027t do this?\" Sergeant Doyle barks.\n\n\nYou raise your weapon, an odd invention that both vaguely resembles and is based on a harpoon.. You take a deep breath, and aim at the humanoid dummy hanging from the commercial drone overhead, set in classic Superman pose. Doyle\u0027s even put a red cape on it. You take aim as it flies past, before firing. The harpoon flies through the air, penetrating the dummy. You drop to a knee, jamming the weapon\u0027s tripod into the ground to stabilize it and putting your full weight on top of it, using your bionic arm to tightly grip the battle to keep it from flying away. The dummy snags as the slack on the harpoon line runs out. You press a button on the side of the weapon, as the line begins to recede inside the device. The dummy is quickly dragged towards the ground, slamming into the soil next to you. You grab it by the neck, crushing the drone carrying it to prevent it from flying off again.\n\n\n\"Well done, Mia. Feel free to tear off its head for good measure.\"\n\n\nYou grab the head, yanking it off, as Doyle smiles.\n\n\n\"Now that\u0027s a confirmed kill. You\u0027re finished for the class. Do whatever you want for the remaining five minutes.\"\n\n\nYou nod, and stroll out of the class. You pause, noticing Dead-Eye waiting for you.\n\n\n\"Mia, I need to talk to you.\"\n\n\n\"Should I be worried?\"\n\n\n\"Not at all. It\u0027s come to my attention that the various teachers have been picking protégés to teach so they\u0027ll be able to get them jobs with their contacts. Shattered Mask is picking the Supers who are best at fighting to work for the Black Eagle Mercenary Corp, Four\u0027s picking Supers with useful abilities for the League of Crime, Mr DeVont\u0027s picking spies for M\u0026J Inc., Doyle\u0027s getting teams together for Maximov and now I\u0027ve realized not only do I have contacts that students could need, but I have a lot of kids who could use a job from them.\"\n\n\n\"Are you offering me a job?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m offering you the chance to work as my protégé. Or, one of them, at least. I\u0027ve cleared your Geometry and Trigonometry classes. I\u0027ll make sure you receive a passing grade in each of them. But be warned: If you shooting classes\u0027 grades drop below an A, you\u0027ll be kicked out of the class. And trust me, you don\u0027t want that. Now, can you do that?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" you bark in response.\n\n\n\"Good. I\u0027d expect nothing less of you. Be at the shooting range for each of them. Got it?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" you reply.\n\n\nDead Eye nods, before turning and walking off. Well, you\u0027re a protégé now, you suppose. You hope it\u0027ll go well. Still, you need to start thinking about after this academy ends. You at least have a job secured, if you can keep up with Dead Eye\u0027s class.\n","page 169":"There\u0027s several more matches, before it finally gets to you.\n\n\n\"Mia Min-Taylor vs Savian Monroe,\" the Doctor says.\n\n\n\"Oh, fuck,\" you mutter.\n\n\n\"Good luck, Mia,\" Luc says, patting you on the back.\n\n\n\"Oh, sweet Jesus,\" Seamus says. \"Uh... avoid the acid, I guess?

Unfortunately, it detonated the explosives the group had made for getting into the vault. It exploded, leading to three casualties and two wounded. The next day, their deaths were a sidebar to a celebration for the Crimson Cape\u0027s work. That\u0027s the problem with Super-Heroes, isn\u0027t it? They\u0027re great symbols and look good in the news, but they\u0027re not effective. Do you know what the best part is?

The famous superhero, the vigilante, the beloved Crimson Cape, showed up to stop a bank heist of around 320\u0027000\u0027000 dollars.

He beat up the robbers, went to the getaway van, yanked the driver out and threw a manhole cover through their getaway van to disable it. Unfortunately, it detonated the explosives the group had made for getting into the vault. It exploded, leading to three casualties and two wounded. The next day, their deaths were a sidebar to a celebration for the Crimson Cape\u0027s work. That\u0027s the problem with Super-Heroes, isn\u0027t it? They\u0027re great symbols and look good in the news, but they\u0027re not effective. Do you know what the best part is? Police Officers were less than a minute away from surrounding the bank, which almost certainly wouldn\u0027t have led to the detonation of their explosives.\"\n\n\nYou stare at the man, wondering where he\u0027s going.\n\n\n\"Three casualties, two wounded. Kevin Min, killed by shrapnel on scene. Alan Taylor, died from blood loss from shrapnel hours later. Jack Min-Taylor, killed in the blast. Poor little Jack. Less than a year old. How young.\"\n\n\n\"Don\u0027t talk about him, you prick!\" you hiss, tears welling in your eyes.\n\n\n\"OK, OK. Let\u0027s get onto the wounded.

No latent abilities, no skills, no training. But vengeance is a powerful motivator, and you\u0027ve got balls, so I think you\u0027d be perfect. Join me. I\u0027m running a... school, I suppose. An academy. A training course. I\u0027m training men to rise up against an unfair system. We bring down assholes like the Crimson Cape who ruin lives and don\u0027t look back. To take from the assholes who have more money than they could spend in a thousand years. Men who are willing to fight for a better world rather than to preserve the status quo. I want you.

The lunch lady is serving food, the guards are busy watching the students size each other up, ready to step in and stop any fights that take place. You quickly jump the counter, grabbing three of the burgers and quickly sliding back over the counter. The lunch lady continues serving food obliviously, the guards don\u0027t seem to have spotted you, and the few other \"students\" here who saw it don\u0027t seem to be eager to rat you out. You smile, and walk with your meal to find somewhere to sit.\n","page 22":"You sit on a bunk bed in a large dormitory. Three other bunk beds are in the room, all shared by your new room mates. So far, you\u0027ve gathered all their names, though you know nothing about them. \n\n\nFirst, there\u0027s Luc, a kid big enough to crush cars into cubes with his bare hands. His arm seems wider than your waist, though he\u0027s not exactly bad looking. Then there\u0027s Seamus, a long-haired boy fidgeting with his fingers, who in five minutes had the time to complain about the room, tell an off-color, vaguely racist joke and recount three different stories. You don\u0027t think you\u0027ve seen him with his lips shut for more than three seconds. Standing in the corner is Shada, a youngish girl with a long scar across her forehead, another on her cheek and a large burn from her bottom lip down along her throat. She looks terrifying, but she seems friendly enough and quite excited. When you asked her what she was excited about, she said the prospect of \"Killing and cutting and shooting and stabbing people\", so maybe friendly wasn\u0027t an accurate descriptor. Finally there\u0027s Jesus, a boy who has a bionic eye just like yours. He seems vaguely creepy and hasn\u0027t talked much, but you doubt it\u0027s fair to judge a book by it\u0027s cover. Seamus, continuing to talk, seemingly refuting all you know about biology by not stopping to take a breath, slowly draws the others into a conversation. Soon, he turns to you. \n\n\n\"Hey! Cyborg girl! Are you planning on joining in the conversation or are you just going to sit there?\" he asks.\n","page 21":"You watch as a syringe sucks blood from your arm as a doctor looks at a monitor.\n\n\n“Huh. No dormant powers showing up. You are related to Saito Benkei. That’s interesting. It’s not helpful, but it’s something to mention at parties.”\n\n\nShit. That’s unhelpful.\n\n\n“Other than that, you’re in reasonable health. No diseases, no serious health conditions, your nervous system hasn’t been fried by it’s new wiring. You’re good. Move along.”\n\n\nThe needle is removed from your arm, and you stand. Dead Eye waits outside with the rest of the students. None of them have been found to contain any worthwhile dormant powers. One of them, Abigail, has enlargedadrenaline glands, but it’s far from enough to elevate her to “Super-Human” status. Other than that you’re all perfectly normal.\n\n\n“I’m sorry to say if any of you have plans to work in the industry, you’re going to have to work hard or be disappointed. At best, you’ll struggle to take on the Supers. At worst, you’ll be one of the countless goons torn apart to slow down whatever Noun Man they send after you until one of our super-powered heavy hitters can show up. Still, as you can see, most kids here are in the same boat, and we didn’t bring you here to have an army of cheap goons we could’ve hired at the docks. For some of the lucky bastards here, their training will involve learning how to do spins as they fly or learning how to control their powers. But, for all their powers, supers are still human. Supers get proud and stupid. They fuck up. That’s when you guys strike.”\n\n\nDead Eye stops, drawing a knife from his boot, and begins to pick his nails as he leans against the wall. Finally, he continues talking.\n\n\n“There’s a few paths you can go down. You’re nothing but fresh clay to mou\u003dld, raw steel to shape, so there’s going to be a lot of choices in your careers. Some of you will learn teamwork, tactics, training and end up in a unit, a small task force. Some of you will find your place among a world of lies and deceit, in covert espionage so intense that Cold War CIA would shit themselves if placed in one of our ops. Some of you, those who are especially talented, will find that with a gun, a sword or whatever weird weapon the special snowflakes of the group pick, you can do enough damage to seriously fuck up a super-humans day. If you’re especially stupid, you might go down the path of ascension. Not all super-humans are born. A lot of them are the product of experiments and accidents. Whether you decide to pump your body full of super-soldier serum, replace half your body with tech or just let the mad docs do whatever the fuck they want to you, you might find yourself more powerful than you thought possible. Remember, though, for every famous super-human to be created from a normal, you’ve got a hundred poor fucks who end up blind, infertile and with a tumor bigger than a second head.”\n\n\nThe Doctor from earlier at the stage arrives, his face as hard as stone, revealing no emotions.\n\n\n“Ah, Doctor Happy. What’s the story? How are you?”\n\n\n“Do we have any super-human specimen here?” he asks in a dull, emotionless tone.\n\n\n“No, they’re all good.”\n\n\n“It is a true pity Mr DeVont did not think to let me oversee the medical exams personally. I would have been much more… thorough.”\n\n\n\"A 40% casualty rate for a simple medical check up is hardly a good thing, doctor.\"\n\n\n\"My last round of medical exams only had a 13% casualty rate, and the cost of hiring replacements was offset by the profits from selling their organs and teeth. We even got a weeks worth of dog feed.\"\n\n\n\"Does the human element mean anything to you?\" Dead-Eye asks.\n\n\nThe Doctor turns around and works off without another word.\n\n\n\"Hey, kids. Word of advice. Stay the fuck away from him. Now, let\u0027s split you guys into your dorms.\"\n","page 24":"You lean back and lie on the bed, waiting.\n\n\n\"Well, somebody\u0027s bitchy,\" Shada says, before the group resumes their conversation.\n\n\nAfter a minute or two, there\u0027s a knock on the door.\n\n\n\"Lunch! Everyone into the canteen!\" a voice screams.\n","page 23":"\"Alright, yeah,\" you say, standing up.\n\n\n\"How\u0027d you lose your eye?\" Jesus asks, the gears in his eye socket whirling as his bionic eye focuses on yours.\n\n\n\"Shrapnel from an explosion.\"\n\n\n\"How were you in an explosion?\" he asks. \n\n\nYou sigh, remembering it. There was blood everywhere. You had no idea what was going on, you were just confused. Your parents just lay there, bleeding.

I ended up gunning down a few assholes, and that got someone\u0027s attention,\" Jesus says. \"You?\"\n\n\n\"I was at the top of my class in the military academy,\" Luc replies. \"I had to drop out due to my... kidney not working.

Well, good at the actual running. I might\u0027ve picked up a few bad habits, like sampling the goods. Ran up a few debts, which that suit, DeVont, is paying off in exchange for me joining up.

Everyone into the canteen!\" a voice screams.\n\n\n\"Alright, let\u0027s bounce,\" you say.\n","page 26":"You walk out of the dorm, and follow the guard as he walks along the hallway. You reach a large, open canteen with two dozen lunch tables with benches. Guards line railing above, holding assault rifles. You walk over to the counter of the canteen, grabbing a tray. You move along the line, watching with confusion as a woman puts food on the trays. The woman puts burgers on some trays, while dumping noodles on others, and finally pouring a grey, dull looking paste onto some of the trays. You move forward, and have the grey paste dumped onto your tray. \n\n\n\"Can I have a burger?\" you ask hopefully\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\n\"We\u0027ve been told to give out the food at random, alternating between noodles, burgers and nutrition paste.\"\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\"It encourages a competitive nature among the students. Stealing lunches or beating the shit out of people who got nicer lunches encourages a Darwinian atmosphere. Survival of the fittest.\"\n\n\nYou turn from the counter and get a glance at the other students of the academy. Most look normal, crowding around tables and being social, although off to the side you spot the supers, either by themselves or in small groups of two or three. Apparently, being so incredibly abnormal as super-humans are does not make you a social creature. There\u0027s stark contrast between the supers. Most look perfectly normal, but one\u0027s skin seems to be a living, breathing rock, another has completely red eyes, a third is a hulking creature bigger than any human has any right to be. They hardly look like friendly people.\n\n\nYou look down at your food, which looks like someone ate tofu and grey food coloring and puked it up. You look around to see if there\u0027s a more viable source of food, and spot several chances. There\u0027s a large pile of delicious burgers calling to you from behind the lunch lady, and you think you could easily slide over the very end of the counter when she\u0027s serving food and snatch a few, although the guards on the railings above give you pause.\n\n\nIf you\u0027re feeling slightly more aggressive, there\u0027s plenty of kids weaker than you around who fortune has shined on. All you need to do is make a few threats and they\u0027ll probably give up their food. \n","page 25":"\"Eat shit.

Everyone into the canteen!\" a voice screams.\n","page 28":"You walk out of the dorm, and follow the guard as he walks along the hallway. You reach a large, open canteen with two dozen lunch tables with benches. Guards line railing above, holding assault rifles. You walk over to the counter of the canteen, grabbing a tray. You move along the line, watching with confusion as a woman puts food on the trays. The woman puts burgers on some trays, while dumping noodles on others, and finally pouring a grey, dull looking paste onto some of the trays.

You follow the man who showed you to your room along the hallway.\n\n\nYou enter a large hall. where a dozen men in amor and holding assault rifles stand at the edges of the hall. There\u0027s dozens of kids, some gagged, and others with their hands bound in magnetic metal handcuffs that imprison their entire hands. Some look eager to be here, others look absolutely terrified. You look to the top of the stage, where you see Sergeant Doyle standing alongside several other kids. There\u0027s a tall, gaunt man with a sunken face wearing a doctor\u0027s coat and a dirty white shirt,  a man in a dark leather trench coat with sunglasses, a man wearing a white suit, a woman wearing a purple and black superhero costume, another in a red and gold one and a third dressed completely in black and silver. The man in the suit strides up to the stage, looking out at you all.\n\n\n\"My name is Victor DeVont. I represent a lot of very successful business interests, most of which has risen up from the bottom. You\u0027re all here because you have either achieved great things at this age or because you were born with great abilities. Your potential was going to be wasted, though. So we gave you a chance for greatness. We\u0027re here to train you as killers, as mercenaries, as soldiers, as henchmen, as crime lords, as rebels, as the people fighting for the greater good no matter how badly the world vilifies them, and over the next year, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll make you into. Welcome to the Prometheus Academy.\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s in it for you?\" someone asks.\n\n\nMr DeVont smiles.\n\n\n\"You\u0027re clever, I\u0027ll give you that. Never trust anyone. That\u0027s your first lesson here. There\u0027s plenty of reasons we do this. The groups funding this experiment need manpower. They\u0027ll be watching, picking out candidates to hire once this is over. Now, let me introduce you to the teachers?\" Mr DeVont says.\n\n\nMr DeVont smiles, and begins walking across the stage.\n\n\n\"This is Sergeant Doyle, Ex-SAS.\"\n\n\n\"Pleasure to see you all, men. Best of luck in the upcoming trials,\" Doyle says.\n\n\n\"Next we have Doctor Frank Griffith. He\u0027ll be in charge of teaching medical care and first aid, as well as looking after your health and working on your cybernetic upgrades, bio-augmentation and the administering of super-soldier serums.\"\n\n\nThe doctor stares at you all with cold, dead eyes, and nods slowly.\n\n\n\"Next, we have Dead Eye, who will be in charge of solo missions, Void, who will be in charge of Flight Training, Four, who will be in charge of Elemental powers, and the Shattered Mask, who will be in charge of Strength, Speed and Agility training.\"\n\n\nMr DeVont then stops, staring out at the crowd. \n\n\n\"Now, you\u0027re each going to be given a schedule depending on your abilities. Some of you, the Supers, will have their work cut out for them. Those unfortunate enough to not be born with powers for the most part have some training in military backgrounds. A few of you are pet projects picked up by some of the instructors on missions. I\u0027m going to split you up into groups and give you each a teacher to guide you through the facility.\" \n\n\nMr DeVont begins to list out names, before assembling you into groups. Eventually, you hear your name called in Dead Eye\u0027s group. Dead Eye hops off the stage and lets out a whistle as kids begin to assemble around him. You see the short, skinny kid who\u0027s into tech walk over to him, and follow hastily. Dead Eye looks at you all, and takes out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a long drag.\n\n\n“Alright, let’s go. First, I’ll take you to the DNA Scanner.”\n\n\n“Why?”\n\n\n“It’ll see your likelihood to have dormant powers,” he says. “Follow me.”\n","page 200":"You grab a wooden baton and twist, swinging it at his head.

He snarls, tearing the baton from your hands and breaking it over his knee. He steps forward, swinging his fists at you.\n\n\nShit, your weapon is gone. You need a new tactic. You can try to take him down quickly with pure aggression, or keep your distance and wait for his weakness to appear.\n","page 321":"\"No.\"\n\n\n\"No?\" he asks in surprise.\n\n\n\"No,\" you reply.\n\n\n\"Alright then,\" Jack says, a bit miffed.\n\n\n\"Mia, this is the only job offer coming for you,\" Dead Eye warns, to which you shrug.\n\n\nWell, you\u0027re finished the Academy, and you have fantastic new skills to use.

You\u0027ve given up one of your lunches to help him move a crate of God knows what, you\u0027ve given him some information on the eating and bathroom habits of one of the Supers and you\u0027ve allowed him to test a new proto-drug on you that, so far, has only had benefits, greatly increasing your reflexes. \n\n\n\"I have something I\u0027d like to test. Follow me,\" he says.\n\n\nYou sigh, and follow him along the hallways towards his office. He opens the door, walking inside and heading straight to the wardrobe. He walks into the wardrobe, pushing open a panel at the back to reveal another door. You notice the picture of Doctor Griffith\u0027s presumed daughter is gone from the desk.\n","page 106":"This is pointless. The serum\u0027s probably not even here. You\u0027re probably too late to meet up with your friends, but you could still go train by yourself, or even try to switch around the names in Mr DeVont\u0027s office.\n","page 348":"You stand in the bleachers among the few remaining students, watching the teachers assemble in the center of the hall where you once smashed Savian Monroe into the floor, except where once was open ground, now there\u0027s a circle in the center of the hall, with large walls, put up to either side of there the people would stand to act as a building, with the insides furnished. The open roof allows you to gaze inside at the fight, where you see weapons hidden throughout, to add an urban feel to the fight.\n\n\n\"Good evening, students. What we are going to do today for our final exam is simple. We are going to do something similar to your first exam. Some of you have formed groups, and you will face a group of identical sizes. Others will fight solo. The rules are the same as last time. This is the end of your long, and hopefully enlightening time at Prometheus Academy. You could end the day with a prosperous future or with all memories of here gone, so fight well. Best of luck.\"\n\n\nWith that, Mr DeVont leads the teachers to the bleachers, leaving only the Doctor to stand at the sidelines. The first few names are called, as two monstrous Supers face off. The battle is fast and brutal. You sit there, watching as two gargantuan brutes charge at each other, one covered in scales with a forked tongue and the second covered in tumor-like lumps made of bone. Scales rams into Bony, attempting to bite into his flesh, but only actually succeeding in biting bone. Bony rams a fist into Scales\u0027 throat, and he flops to the floor. You feel a sense of Déjà vu as you watch the Doctor walk forward, jamming a needle into Scales\u0027 soft throat, before requesting two guards to help him drag the beast off.\n\n\nThere\u0027s a few other short battles, where students have short, fierce battles that end quickly enough when a simple, small mistake is quickly capitalized on, ending the battle. Few even venture into the \"buildings\" to get weapons. Finally, it gets to you.\n\n\n\"Seamus O\u0027Riley, Shada Melik, Mia Min-Taylor, Luc Petit, step down to the stage. Lawrence Bender, Sally Menke, Andrezej Sekula, Thara Richtofen, same for you,\" Mr DeVont shouts.\n\n\n\"Alright, let\u0027s do this,\" Luc says, cracking his neck.\n\n\n\"There was no need to do that other than to show off,\" Seamus complains.\n\n\n\"Alright, which battle plan do we go with?\" Shada asks.\n\n\n\"Wait to see what they\u0027re doing. Then, I\u0027ll decide,\" you say.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m cool with that,\" Shada says.\n\n\nYou walk down to the middle of the arena, standing between the two \"buildings\". The others stand on the other side. At the lead is Thara Richtofen, a Super with some seriously terrifying abilities in regards to fire, and a cruel and vicious personality to match. You\u0027ll definitely have a hard fight again. You all line up, preparing to fight. You take a defensive stance, waiting patiently.\n\n\nThe bell rings.\n\n\nThe other team immediately charge toward you, fists raised. It seems they\u0027re going with the aggressive, head-strong strategy, which for someone with flame abilities, isn\u0027t the worst tactic. You\u0027ve practiced three battle strategies extensively. Battle Strategy A, Battle Strategy B, Battle Strategy C and Battle Strategy D. \n\n\n-A: Charge the enemy as a solidified unit, quickly taking them down and securing victory.\n\n\n-B: Retreat as a unit to get weapons to gain a solid advantage over the enemy, securing victory.\n\n\n-C: Have Luc charge them to create a distraction, giving the rest of you a better chance to get to the weapons, securing victory.\n\n\n-D: Charge the enemy as a trio, while Seamus leaves to get a firearm, securing victory.\n\n\nYou have to admit, the \"securing victory\" part doesn\u0027t necessarily apply, but still.\n","page 55":"The day is long and hard.

Mr DeVont?\" you ask.\n\n\nYou swing the door open, revealing an empty office. There\u0027s a desk with a few pictures and a computer on it, a trophy rack containing a tattered, burnt cape, a long sword, a metal spine and a greenish rock.

Dead Eye watches from the edge of the room. Your partner, Shada, eagerly bounces on the balls of her feet.\n\n\n“I’ve always wanted to play with explosives,” she says. “Do you think if we do well they’ll let us play with bigger payloads? I mean, plastic explosives gets the job done, but it’s not enough on its own. There needs to be steel ball bearings, or gasoline canisters, or something to make it a bit more interesting, you know?”\n\n\n\"You\u0027re messed up, you know that?\" you say to her.\n\n\n“If I wasn’t messed up, people would find me much more boring.”\n\n\n\"Alright, for the next hour, I don\u0027t want any joking around, I don\u0027t want any messing, and I don\u0027t want anyone messing anything up,\" Dead Eye shouts. \"You are not playing with fire, you are playing with high grade explosives. If you don\u0027t listen to me, these thing\u0027s could go off. These are not decoys, they will not spray dye in your face, they will tear flesh, break bone and end life. These things are lethal.

Alright, everyone, look at what you have. The explosive itself, the detonator, the timer, wiring...\"\n\n\nDead Eye continues listing out parts of the device, as Shada listens eagerly. Dead Eye begins his instructions, but it seems Shada has already pushed you out and taken over the project with unrelenting glee. \n\n\n\"Alright, now...\"\n\n\nThere\u0027s a loud boom and you\u0027re sent head first sprawling to the floor. You smack your head against the hard ground. You groan, looking up. One of the tables has been completely destroyed, and the remainder of what was once a student lies there. Another student lies on her stomach, covered in a growing pool of blood. Dead Eye lets out a curse, grabbing a walkie-talkie.\n\n\n\"Get me medical, fast!\" he says. \"Everyone, stand away from the explosives.\"\n\n\nDead Eye quickly moves around the room, disabling the explosives by snipping the wires connecting the detonator to the payload. Only then does he actually check the pulse of the girl on the ground.\n\n\n\"Shit. Look at this, kids. This is what the academy is. You\u0027re risking your life here. Class dismissed.\"\n\n\nYou notice Shada is lying on the ground, and you grab her hand and help her stand.\n\n\n\"Oh fuck... that was Jesus\u0027 table.\"\n\n\nYou stare at the remains of the kid on the ground, and wonder if you should\u0027ve ever joined Prometheus Academy.

Move it!” Dead-Eye yells from the hallway.\n\n\nYou slowly open your eyes and let out a yawn. You roll out of bed and stand up. The others all slowly get out of bed. You see Luc, who had stripped to his underwear the night before, hop out of bed and let out a massive yawn, taking the time to marvel at how incredibly chiseled the Frenchman’s chest is, with almost unrealistic definition. He catches you staring and smiles, and you quickly blush and look off to the side.\n\n\n“End of the hallway are two large bathrooms! There should be a locker with your name on it, where a towel and a fresh pair of clothes will be. You have twenty minutes.”\n\n\nYou rush out of the room, heading towards the end of the hall where you are absorbed by a stream of other children. You reach the bathrooms, which are divided by simple “MALE” and “FEMALE” signs, and quickly head into yours. The bathrooms are simple, with a large section of stalls and sinks, a large open area room filled with showers and dozens of lockers lining the room. The lockers are arranged by alphabetical order, so you head to roughly three quarters down to the M Section, and find your name. You open it, and find a white towel, undergarments, a pair of grey trousers and a grey t-shirt, emblazoned with a large flame insignia with the words “Prometheus Academy” underneath. It’s certainly more fitting than the plain white clothes that would quickly be stained with food, dirt or blood, depending on the day.\n\n\nYou grab a towel, and look around, wondering how you’re supposed to get naked and wash with all these other kids around. You blush as you see other girls shamelessly stripping down and tossing dirty clothes aside, so you quickly decide to follow suit. You cautiously pull off your clothes, and head nervously into the showers, covering your privates and chests as best you can without looking awkward. You turn on the showers, and in return are hit by a blast of hot water. You begin washing yourself, noticing as several harsh looking scars covering the other girls in there. You’re particularly impressed by the size of Shada’s burn, which goes from the bottom lip all the way down to her navel. It looks painful, and you doubt it’s a story she’ll want to share, so you stay quiet. You quickly wash and dry yourself off, and get dressed. Outside, the various teachers wait to take their classes off to the various sections of the facility. You check your schedule. First up is “Improvised Explosives”. That’ll be… interesting.\n","page 59":"Time to ask a question.\n","page 58":"There\u0027s little ceremony for Jesus and the girl, AJ. Their bodies, or what remained of their bodies, were taken away, and you\u0027re sent onto your next class. You feel horrible thinking of those bodies, but if anything, that demonstrated that you can\u0027t be weak. You need to stay strong, and keep working. You walk through the doors of the Doctor\u0027s Lab. The Doctor stands there, waiting.\n\n\n\"Come right in, children. We have work to do. Today\u0027s your first round of treatment.\"\n\n\n\"Treatment?\" Luc asks. \"What is this treatment?\"\n\n\n\"I\u0027m glad you asked. Your bodies are weak. Pathetic. This... serum will help. It will increase adrenaline production, increase muscle mass, intelligence, bone density, skin toughness, white blood cell production, and much more. It will give you a fighting chance against the Supers.\"\n\n\n\"What\u0027s it made of?\" someone asks.\n\n\n\"Many things. Calcium, Adrenaline, Darwinium, Super-Human blood, White Blood Cells, much more. It should hurt a lot.\"\n\n\nThe Doctor draws a syringe, his face as cold and emotionless as stone. He walks forward, up to a student, and slowly jabs the syringe into her wrist, before pushing down on the plunger. The girl shudders and contorts her face in pain.\n\n\n\"It... burns!\" she whimpers.\n\n\n\"I\u0027m glad,\" the Doctor says.\n\n\nShada whimpers, looking nervously at the needle.\n\n\n\"I REALLY hate needles,\" she mutters to you.\n\n\nThe doctor pulls the syringe out, replacing it with another in his coat pocket. He moves onto the next student, continuing around the room, injecting each was a shot of serum. Finally, he reaches you. You stick out your arm, and he grabs your wrist, injecting his syringe into your wrist. He presses down on the plunger, and you feel the horrible, burning liquid enter your bloodstream. You feel a sharp, burning pain, which slowly dies down as the serum dilutes itself your blood. You take a deep breath and close your eyes, as the burning feeling slowly dissipates.\n\n\nThe Doctor walks to the front of the class, staring at you all.\n\n\n\"Hmmm... I badly misjudged this,\" he mutters.\n\n\n\"You misjudged this how?\" Shada asks nervously, looking at the needle hole in her arm.\n\n\n\"I was told that as long as 85% of you survived, this would be a success, and hence, I increased the concentration of the serum. I was hoping for at least a few of you to die.\"\n\n\nShada lets out an awkward laugh, perhaps thinking the Doctor is joking.\n\n\n\"Yes. Hilarious. You watched two students blow themselves up earlier, but don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m the person hear to trust with your safety\" the Doctor says. \n\n\nShada goes quiet. The Doctor goes to his desk, opening a draw and pulling out a notepad. He flicks through the notepad.\n\n\n\"It seems you have an exam coming up soon. Lovely. Alright, feel free to talk until the end of class.
