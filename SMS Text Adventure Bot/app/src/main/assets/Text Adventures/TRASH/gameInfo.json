["83","TRASH","EndMaster","6","2","5.89","https://chooseyourstory.com/story/TRASH.aspx","Yee Haw! It\u0027s a trailer park life for me!\nAdditional Notes:\nThis story has a ton of offensive langauge and humor so if you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you probably shouldn\u0027t read it. Though given the setting, the language used is pretty accurate.\nThis also isn\u0027t really a \"win/lose\" type story. While there are some endings better than others, this is basically just a tale about a typical day of a degenerate that lives in a trailer park."]
